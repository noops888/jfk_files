SECUPITY MATTER -

KING,

JR.

BACKGROUND: On 10/19/66, AT 1387-Sadvised that Martin Luther

King, Jr.,

President, Southern Christian Leadership Conterence:

had recently met with McGeorge Bundy, Director of the Ford

Foundation. At this meeting, Bundy, on behalf of the Ford

foundation, offered King's organization a grant of three

million dollars.

Bundy explained that the Ford Foundation

is extremely interested in various programs of the Southern

Caristian Leadership Conference. Also, the Ford Foundation

is sympathetic with the financial problems of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference. According to the source,

"the only concern of king and his associates is that if they

accept this grant, wether lie furù fuuriatioù vili cacroice

control over the policies and operations of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference. We do not know at this time

If the Ford Foundation has made this grant.

OBSERVATIONS: Information has recently come to our attention

indicating that King and his group are in need of financial

support.

This contact with the Ford Foundation would un-

doubtedly be of great assistanceto him at this particular

time.

It is felt that the Ford Foundation is not aware

of the subversive backgrounds of King's principal advisers

and that if the proper officials of the Ford Foundation

were briefed concerning them, this might preclude any

assistance being granted. Listed below are four principal

ladvisers to King with subversive backgrounds:

Harry Wachtel's name appeared as an active member of

the National Lawyers Guild in December, 1949, according

to a confidential source.

The National Lawyers Guilc

has been cited as a communist front by the House

Committee on Un-American Activities.

It should be noted

that

• Wachtel is a New York City attorney. Another

confidential source advised in March, 1944, his name

appeared on a list of names, significance not known,

maintained at the Communist Party Headquarters of Kings

County, Brooklyn, New York.

Leonora, a confidential source advised in March, 1944,

that she was a newly elected officer of the Bath Beach

Club of the Kings County Communist Party, Brooklyn,

New York.

Bayard Rustin, during the early 1940's was a

member of the Young Communist League, an organization

which has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order- 10450.

The records of this Bureau's Identification

Division contain the following arrest record for

Bayard Rustin:

On 1/12/44 he was arrested for viola

tion of the Selective Service Act and on 2/17/44

received a sentence of three years. On 9/15/40 he

was arrested in New York City on a disorderly conduci

charge and was sentenced to fifteen days.

On 1/21/53

he was arrested in Pasadena, California,

for offering

to engage in an act of sex perversion of a homosexual

nature, which he admitted and for which he was

sentenced to serve 60 days.

RECOMMENDATION:

In an effort to preclude the possibility of

the Southern Christian Leadership receiving Ford Foundation

funds, it is recommended that a Bureau official be designated

to contact John Bugas, former Special Agent in Charge of

the

Detroit Office and presently a vice president of the Ford

Motor Company, concerning the above-set forth facts so that

he might bring

• them to the attention of whomever he feels

appropriate in either the Ford family or the Ford Foundation.

In the event the above recommendation is not

and briefed him generally regarding the background of Martin

Ford Foundation, had been in touch with King relative to

offering a sizeable grant to the Southern Christian Leadership

Mr. Bugas informed me that he was very grateful for

Ithe Director having me brief him concerning this matter. He

stated he would personally contact Bundy in an effort to put

a stop to king receiving any funds from the ford Foundation.

He advised that the Ford Motor Company had little control

over the ford Foundation yet the ford Motor Company was always

glad to receive information which could be of service in guiding

the activities of the Ford Foundation.

Mr. Bugas also brought up the fact that I had recently

called him, at the Director's instructions, relative to indicating

that the Ford Motor Company was about to enter into a contract

with officials of a company in Mexico who were deeply involved

A.

with Communists.

He stated he had put a halt to this contract

and that his company was very grateful to the Director and the

contract negotiations.

POSSIBLE GRANT OF $3,000,000 FROM FORD FOUNDATION

CONTACT WITH JOHN BUGAS, VICE PRESIDENT,

FORD MOTOR COMPANY

5- Suste

My memorandum to you of 10/25/66 reflected a call to Mr n

Bugas, relative to confidentially advising him that McGeorge Bunay,

Irisident, Ford Foundation, had contacted Martin Luther King

offering a grant of $3,000,000 to the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) • Mr. Bugas was grateful for the information In

furnished him yesterday.

He expressed alarm and indicated that

although the Ford Motor Company had little control over the Ford

Foundation, he nevertheless would immediately attempt to get in

Bundy and do something about this matter.

1/8

Mr. Bugas called me back at 11:30 this morning. He stated

he had contacted Bundy and had asked him for an appointment within

the next several days. Bundy asked why he wanted to see him.

Bugas replied he was in receipt of information concerning the \

SCLC. Bundy asked for the source of his' information.

Bugas told

him his source did not want to be divulged. Bundy stated under

the circumstances he would refuse to talk to Bugas and would

discuss the matter only with the source. Bundy then asked if

the source was the FBI. Bugas refused to reveal the source and

the conversation was terminated.

1:1,

UH'LIA

Bugas stated he thought Bundy had been rather high-handed

lin the conversation; however, he wanted to request that the

Director give serious consideration to an FBI representative

contacting Bundy, inasmuch as this matter represents one of

great importance

to the Ford Motor Company. Bugas indicated his

company had had quite a number of "hard blows" from the Ford

Foundation over the years and most certainly a liaison between

this foundation and

Martin Luther King would be a serious blow

to the company.

Mr. Tolson

I told Bugas that, in view of Bundy's attitude, it appeared

rather matter conser stathe vested this no even car tated

to express again the importance of this matter to the Ford Motor

Company.

He stated he

did not know Bundy; however, Bundy had

apparently been rather snobbish in dealing with the Ford people.

He explained that when Bundy first took this job, Bundy had been

invited to Detroit to meet Henry Ford III and the top people of

the company. At that time Bundy was point-blank advised that he

lIsbould be careful in administering the ford foundation, inasmuch

as this Foundation had caused serious harm to the sales of the Ford

Motor Company.

Bundy allegedly stuck his nose in the air and

¡stated "I have a social responsibility to fulfill."

Mr. Bugas once again stated that any liaison between the

Ford Foundation and Martin Luther King would "set his company back

to boat hell..". He asked again that we consider contacting Bundy

directly and

stated he would appreciate knowing of any action

taken in this regard.

ACTION:

I personally feel that Bundy is of the psuedo-intellectual,

Ivy League group that has little respect for the FBI. He was

friendly on the surface while at the White House and I met him

frequently. Under the circumstances, it appears rather doubtful

that contact with him by the FBI will convince him one way or

another.

It is, therefore,

recommended that I advise Mr. Bugas

that, while we appreciate his concern, there is some doubt that

contact by us with Bundy would amount

to anything.

It will be

suggested to him that he might desire to bring this matter to

Mr. Henry Ford's attention,

in the event Mr. Ford desires to attempt

to exercise any control over Bundy.

Mr. Bugas, during our

conversation, noted that Mr. Ford was out of the country at the

present time.

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

RE:

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

100-3-104-34

OBSERVATIONS:

Although the activities of the sch are creating substantial

controversy in the southern states, O'Dell's position in the Communist

Party (CP) and close association with important CP members such as

Stanley David Levison, New York attorney who is a secret CP member

and source of Party funds, provide excellent reasons for his communist

background to be exposed. Any influence which the CP may have acquired

or may betrying to exert through O'Dell within the SCLC would undoubted-

ly be greatly reduced by such exposure at this time.

ACTION:

(1) It is recommended that the attached memorandum sunmarizing

the public source information about O'Dell be forwarded to Mr. DeLoach

for his consideration and possible use by his contacts in the news

media field in such southern states as Alabama where King has announced

that the next targets for integration of universities are located.

(2) • Attached for your approval is a letter to the SAC

New York,

to advise him that this proposed counterintelligence plan

is being

handled

at the Bureau.

HUNTER PITTS/O DELL

Resorting to its typical methods of infiltration

into any organization to carry out its primary objectives

of building up controversy and widespread unrest, Communist

has succeeded in getting one of its most

experienced organizers in the south into the key position

of consultant to the field staff of Reverend Martin Luther

King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.,

In an

article reporting the news conference in Birmingham,

staff of workers in at least six southern states engaged • •

in helping community organizations to establish registration

schools, work shops and public meetings.

O'Dell, who has been known as Hunter Pitts O'Dell

since his birth in 1723 at Detroit, Michigan, attended

Xavier University in Louisiana.

He salled as a seaman in

the Merchant Marine Service until he was expelled from the

National Maritime Union in 1950 at Galveston

circulating pro-Soviet peace petitions attacking the United

States Government:

subcommittee, clearly established his key position in the

communist movement in the South.

On 7/30/58 at Atlanta, Georgia, O'Dell again

invoked the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution

when answering questions about his conmunist activities

upon his appearance as a witness before the House Committee

on Un-American Activities.

Since the publicity in 1956 surrounding his

ittempted to remain quietly in the backround and carr

ut his rarty assignments through arriliation with suci

The American people can solve their own

problems more effectively and quickly if communists

It is realized that there are many serious considera-

tions to be made regarding this suggestion, particularly at this

time..

However, it is believed that Southern newspapers because

it is timely, would possibly give a very full coverage to such

material.

It is believed that such an exposure would cause other

Negro organizations such as the Negro American Labor Council

(NALC) to clean out anyone who possibly could cause embarrassment

because of Communist affiliation or background.

eference is made to my memorandum to you in this matter /

dated. August 31, 1964, in which the Director approved the recommendation

to have Assistant Director Malone orally brief Francis Cardinal Spellman

concerning Martin Luther King, Jr.'s.communist connections and

degenerate

_make-up to avoid the possibility of having the Pope grant

audience to King in connection with his proposed visit to Rome

later this month,

Malone was briefed in this matter and told to stress two

things in his contact with Cardinal Spellman, the first being that

he should stress oi course the confidential nature of our briefing

¡so that the Bureau would not be drawn into the picture, and, secondly,

to ascertain if Cardinal Spellman could take the necessary

' action

in his relationship with the Pope so that if he could not, we could

take appropriate steps through other channels.

Malone called today and stated that he had discussed the

Situation with Cardinal Spellman over the weekend and he said that

the cardinal took instant steps to advise the Vatican against

granting any audience to King.

He stated that Cardinal Spellman

assured him that he would respect the confidential nature of the

information and added that the Cardinal was most pleased and

his confidence and to rely upon him to handle such a delicate matter.

Cardinal Spellman is going to Rome next week to attend the Ecumenical

Council and thus will be on the scene personally and further insure

that the Pope is not placed in an embarrassing position through any

contact with King.

We'have just learned that Martin Luther King,

JI.;

and

some

of his advisors, including

Bayard Rustin and Clarence Jones, are work-

ing on an article which is to be submitted over King's name for publi-

cation in "The Saturday Evening Post."

The article would deal with

such matters as the poverty bill,

elections, riots and the so-called

"""backlash"' that is cropping up in political circles.

The only publica-

tion known to be considered for this article to date is "The Saturday

Evening Post."

He do not as yet know specifically what line King will

take in the article or what its specific stands will be. The matter of

this article is scheduled for further discussion by King and his advisors

on 9/22/64 in New York City. This information is classified "Secret?"

OBSERVATIONS:

-Because of the communist influences on King

it would

be well

to prevent any publication of his views. It is noted

that earlier this..

year we had some advance information on the possibility of a King

article being published by "The

Saturday Evening Post." On that occa-

sion Assistant Director Deloach's office was able to take appropriate

action to forestall the publication of the article.

This was handled

by Supervisor William Stapleton, who has an appropriate contact at "The

Saturday Evening Post."

ACTION:

We have separately made appropriate dissemination of the

information concerning King's intentions to have an article published

in "The Saturday Evening Post" and have also written the Atlanta and

New York Offices to remain on top of the situation so that the Bureau

will be promptly furnished further developments in this matter.

More recent information has just been received to the

effect that a John Hunt of "The Saturday Evening Post" has already

been in contact with King concerning material being prepared for

the "post." Also, King and some of his advisors are to meet

briefly on the late afternoon of 9/11/64 while King is waiting at

the airport in New York City for a flight overseas. They are to

further discuss the article in question.

In'light of the latest information, it is suggested that

if any action is taken by hir. Deloach, it be

done as soon as possible

so that it would be less difficult for "Post" people to take the

action desired:

We have learned that Martin Luther King,

Jr, 1s5"

scheduled to appear in Davenport,

at a banquet

sponsored by the Davenport Chapter of the Catholic Interracial

Council (CIC). King will reportedly be paid $1, 000 for his

appearance and also be given the "Pacem in Terris" award, the

Isecond year such an award has been given by the CIC. The frst

such awards were given in 1964 to the late President Kennedy

and to John Howard Griffin, a writer. The award is in memory

of Pope John.

Pist

and the Director approved, that Francis

orally briefed concerning King's communist connections and

moral degeneracy. so that such

information could be passed on

to the Pope as it was anticipated that King would seek an

audience with the Pope.

Such briefing of the Cardinal

subsequently

was made by Assistant Director Malone in New York City.

It is shocking indeed that King continues to be

honored by religious groups.

Inasmuch as commitments have

apparently been made by the

CIC for the award in Davenport,

there is little likelihood that anything can be done in this

instance to prevent such an award. It is believed, however,

that it would be desirable to have Assistant Director Malone

recontact Cardinal Spellman and bring to his attention the

information we continue to receive about King being given

honors by Catholic groups, citing the Davenport CIC award

a current instance.

It could be tactfully suggested that in

the end it might well be embarrassing to the Catholic Church for

having given honors to King. A discussion with the Cardinal

might well suggest to bim the desirability for the Cardinal

to initiate such action as he deems appropriate, through church

circles, to alert Catholic institutions and organizations concerning

It would appear that the Cardinal would certainly be,

appreciative for the information we are giving him in

Martin Luther King,

is to be in West Berlin, Germany,

for the opening of that city's cultural festival 9/13/64.

just obtained details of his itinerary for travel abroad which reveals

that he will leave the United States either 9/11 or 12/64 and not

return until 9/22/64. Included in his itinerary is a visit to Rome,

Italy. He is to go there from Madrid, Spain, 9/18/64, and remain in

Rome until the morning of 9/20/64 when he will go to london,

England.

We have not as yet obtained any information indicating the

purpose of his visit to Rome, but it is entirely likely that ne may

seek and be given an audience with the Pope. This likelihood is

clearly evident when one considers that King is receiving more and

more acclaim as a leader of the Negro people in this country, plus

the fact that he is a clergyman. Further, King we know is being con-

sidered for the Nobel Peace Prize andhis receiving an audience with

the Pope would likely receive considerable publicity, especially in

It would be shocking indeed for such an unscrupulous character

as King to receive an audience with the Pope. It is believed that if

a plan to see the Pope is in the making, it ought to be nipped in the

bud.

We have considered different possibilities for meeting this

problem and believe that the best one would be to have Assistant

Director Malone of the New York Office personally contact Francis

Cardinal Spellman and on a highly confidential basis bring to the

Cardinal's attention (1) the laet that kins is to visit Rome and of

likelihood of his receiving an audience-with the Pope and (2)

unsavory nature of King's character, both trom a subversive and toral

napoint.

Malone should be able to impress upon the Cardinal the

likely

embarrassment that may result to the Pope should he grant King

audience and King is later discredited. In this light it would

hardly even be necessary for Malone to "suggest" what the Cardinal

should do to forestall any possible audience.

Malone should stress

the highly confidential nature of this matter with the Cardinal, who

is very.

friendly to the Bureau, and insure that the Bureau is in 10

way associated with any action taken by the Cardinal or the Vatican.

Malone should also obtain from the Cardinal a commitment that he

will be able to block any attempt by King to gain an audience with

the Pope. If the Cardinal is not able to give such an assurance,

we must immediately know this so that we may explore some other avenue.

RECOMMENDATION:

If approved, Assistant Director Malone should personally

orally brief Francis Cardinal Spellman in accordance with the attached

"Top Secret" summary indicating King's communist connections and

degenerate make-up.

(This is the same summary we previously used

"In preventing King's receiving an honorary degree from Marquette

University.)

The attached summary should also be used for telephon-

ically briefing Malone.

This matter should receive most expeditious

handling because of the time element involved.

Certain activities of radical pacifist groups in the

Netherlands are causing increasing concern to Netherlands

Government authorities because of the possibility that they

may constitute a threat to public order and safety. One of

these groups which is particularly active is known as the

from persons such as Mahatma Gandhi and the Reverend Martin

The BVD said that it felt that it would be useful

to them in analyzing and studying the activities of these groups

if it had availablesome information regarding the methods and

techniques used and expounded by Rev. King.

They ask.if the

Bureau has any examples of training material or directives.

asking for only what we might have and is not in

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JPu.:

HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT

Coniidential sources who have furnished reliabie

intormation in the past have advised that Martin luther

•King, Jf., has the reputation among many of the country's

Negro leaders of being a heavy consumer of alcoholic

beverages and is know to certain Negro leaders to be

extremely loose in his moral behavior. As an example,

these sources cited an incident which occurred several

years ago in lemphis, Tennessee, when King attended a Negro

Baptisi Convention. With King's Knowledge, some of the

ministers arranged to rent, Iron sone families, apartnents

at a housing project.

the permanent tenants were advised

that the aparinents were needed for "neditation." Astually,

they were used for sex and drinking bartes. These sources:

heard from other individuals, whom they believed to be

reliable, thai during the Convention King becue so intoxii.

cated that he caused a scene in the housing project. Deirg

unable to lind the apartment he desired. "Some of his

colleagues had to physically restrain King lest he be

recognized by some of the tenants and thus jeopardize the

Image of the ministers as vell as that of the desegregation

movement.

Bayard Rustin, in discussing King's recent trip

¿o Oslo, Norway, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, advised

two acquaintances on December 16, 1961, that he was called

by the police at 4:30 a.I. one morning

because the police

had caught a prostitute coming out of the roöm of A. D. King,

Martin's brother.

A. D. King attempied to evade the police,

by running into

Martin's IOOl.

The police accused the

prostitute ai stealing money: norever, she claimed she nad

been pala by the occupant oi

claimed that he talked the police out of arresting the

prostitute in order to avoid besmirching the reputation of

so ava to be out as

Today I visited His Excellency, the Most Reverend

during which time His Excellency expressed his very high

regard for the Director and the work of the FBI. He

indicated that he had had the opportunity during past years

to cooperate with the Bureau representatives and

he appeared

most appreciative of my visit.

He indicated that during the

past six months, he has tried to become acquainted with

the various problems which face his church in the Chicago

area, but that a big part of the six months he has spent in

traveling and, therefore, is not as well versed in the

entire situation concerning Chiçago as he would like to be.

At this point he commented that he was worried

about the presence

of Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING in

Chicago and stated that KING had visited him here in

Chicago some time ago.

This gave me an opportunity to

I ask him his impression of KING. His Excellency stated

Ithat this was the first occasion he had talked with KING

and he was "not impressed".

He stated that during the

conversation, KING exhibited a very

glib tongue and ilis

Excellency could not help but question his sincerity.

His

Excellency stated that he felt KING was not a

a truthful man

and gave as an example that KING agreed that the con-

versation between KING and His Excellency would remain in

strictest

confidence.

He pointed

out, however, that the

"conveniently available" outside the

Archbishop's

residence upon the departure of KING and KING spoke at

length to the press concerning his visit with the arch-

oishop, even though the two men had agreed the conversation

I then, in strictest confidence, briefed His

Excellency along

• the lines discussed with

Assistant Director

SULLIVAN.

It was obvious that His Excellency sincerely

appreciated receiving this information and indicated to me

Ithat he would be most

t circumspect in his dealings with RING.

His Excellency is a very forceful individual, and .

from his comments and demeanor, I feel certain that he

will

do everything possible to neutralize KING's effect in

area.

I feel that this visit was highly productive. He

has accepted my invitation to visit the Chicago Office.

He

gave me

his private telephone number and asked that we

Prompt, imaginative and aggressive action, tempered with

the knowledge that full security is. lan absolute necessity, has5-(

resulted in preventing martin Lutherning, ur., from receiving anlo

honorary degree from Marquette University. Within 15 minutes after

receipt oî Atlanta letter 2-18-64 advising- that negotiations were

underway for Marquette to confer upon king an honorary degree on

3-6-64, the supervisor of captioned matter,. Seymor FredPhillips,

brought to your personal attention the Atlanta letter with an urging

that immediate steps be taken to prevent the action by Marquette

provided it could be done with full security.

Subsequent negotiations between us, Assistant Director

DeLoach and' SAC Baker of the Milwaukee Office developed that the

Chancellor at Marquette, Father Edward J.XQ'Donnell, is a very

close contact of the Bureau and one who could be trusted with Bureau

information given him.

Supervisor Phillips prepared my memorandum

to you 3-4-64 setting out the background in this matter and pointing

out that the Director had received an honorary degree from Marguette

in 1950, thus further indicating the necessity for taking positive

steps to head off the action being contemplated by Marquette relative

to King.

With the Director's approval, we telephonically briefed

SAC Baker of information concerning not only King's communist

associations but his morar degeneracy

DeLoach to Mohr Memo

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr. "

I told the Senator I preferred not to speak with Dr. Olds about this matter and that I

wanted him, Senator Saltonstall, to know that under no circumstances should this infor-

mation be attributed to the FBI.

The Senator assured me that he would treat our infor-

mation on a confidential basis; however, he might possibly have to take Dr. Olds into

his confidence.

I had been back in my office approximately 30 minutes when Senator

Saltonstall called me. He stated that Dr. Olds was in his office at the time, having

dropped by as result of a trip to Washington to work on the President's poverty program.

Senator Saltonstall inquired if I would see Dr. Olds right away. I told him that I was

tied up on other matters and it would be impossible. He next inquired if I could see

Dr. Olds at 8:00 a.m. on the morning of 4/8/64. I told Senator Saltonstall I couldn't do

this inasmuch as I had a commitment to attend a breakfast meeting of a civic group. He

then closed the conversation by stating Dr. Olds would call me and arrange an appoint-

ment. I asked Senator Saltonstall if he had disclosed the remarks made during our

previous conversation to Dr. Oids. He stated that he had inasmuch as he wanted io maje

it absolutely certain that Reverend King did not appear at Springfield College. I told hin

that under the circumstances then that I would see Dr. Olds.

Dr. Olds, after making an appointment, came by my office at 4:00 p.m.:

4/8/64. He opened the conversation by stating that he fully recognized the necessity to -

keep the information concerning King in strict confidence.

He stated he wanted us to

know that he would maintain this confidence and would not advise anyone of this informa-

tion. He pointed out that he had been very shocked when Senator Saltonstall told him of

hest facts as a had inted that Reveren. Kids be prevented Some asite commence-

sensible, intelligent individual, stated that due to the fact that he will keep this informa-

tion confidential, it would be impossible for him to "uninvite" King to make the appear -

lance-at-springfield College. He stated that the "liberals" on his Board of Trustees

would probably tear him to bits if he now cancelled King's appearance. I told Dr. Olas

at this point that any action he took in this regard was entirely up to him but that no

information was to be attributed to the FBI and that we were to be kept strictly out of

I this matter. He stated he fully recognized this fact and no one would ever know that the

FBI had given Senator Saltonstall this information. Dr. Olds did say that he would taie

immediate steps to prevent Reverend King from receiving an honorary degree. He said

he wanted to think about the possibility ot prevening ing from making the address but

at this step of the game he did not see how it could be done.

Dr. Olds expressed a desire to shake hands with the Director some day.

He indicated he had issued the Director two invitations in the recent past to receive an

honorary degree and make the commencement address at Springfield College. However.

Congress was in session.

Upon leaving, Dr. Olds assured me that no information would be released

and none would be attributed to the FBI. I told him that we, would, of course, deny any

such information had been furnished. At this point he advised me that, of course, his

According to the information it is expected that King will

SAC Johnson of Chicago, made a check

and determined it would not be possible to assure full security in any

effort to provide coverage of King's hotel room while he

was in Chicago.

SAC Johnson suggested that Sandy. Smith of the "Sun Times" Chicago, an

excellent contact of the Chicago Office be alerted to King's presence

at the Chicago Sheraton hotel, in order that Smith might determine if he.

could develop sufficient facts to cause an expose of King.

Mr. Wick advised that Sandy Smith of the "Sun Times" is an

After consideration

of this matter with Mr. Belmont and Nr. Wick, SAC

Johnson of Chicago was

told to go ahead with his suggested contact with Sandy Snith alerting

Albany Office this morning (12/8/64) and find that the Bureau's

relations with the Governor are most friendly and that the

Governor has been cooperative with the Bureau.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is believed that we should consider taking steps

to orally brief Rockefeller, on a confidential basis, so that

he may be fully apprised as

to the communist influence on King

and King's moral degeneracy.

Such briefing may well change

Rockefeller's intentions,

i in fact he has such, to conate a

large sum of money to or through King. There appears to be no

reason why such action would work to the Bureau's detriment

in any way; more likely, it would probably be received by the

Governor with much thanks on his part: He have considered the

following courses of action, listed in order of preference, any

one of which would serve to

implement the suggested action.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Martin Luther King, Jx., has for some time been

maintaining a close liaison with both present and former

members of the Communist Party, USA. For example, King

has been receiving guidance and counsel and relying greatly

during the past few years on Stanley David Levison who is

a long-time well-indoctrinated communist and was as recently

as

july, 196s, a member of the Party.

Mosi of King's

principal advisors are individuals with subversive backgrounds.

King has continued his

association with some Party members

notwithstanding advice to him,

King, about the communist

background oi the individuals involved.

In addition, information fxom concidential and

reliáble sources exposes King as amoral degenerate.

SUBJECT:

RACIAL SITUATION

ALBANY, GEORGIA

GRACIAL MATTERS :

1 =

An article has appeared in the "Atlanta Constitution," Atlanta, Georgia,

on 11/19/62 which article was taken from the "New York Times." In the article,

Reverend Martin Luther King, JI., stated he agreed with the report written by

Howard Zinn issued by the Southern Regional Council concerning the recent racial

situation in Albany, Georgia. The report referrred to criticized the work of this

Bureau in relation to the Albany situation. King has stated among other things

that "Agents of the FBI in Albany, Georgia, sided with segregationists."

There are no facts to support this and it is noteworthy that the comments

by King would appear to dovetail with information which has been furnished to this

Bureau indicating that King's advisers are Communist Party (CP) members and

he is under the domination of the CP.

King is the President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

and it should be noted that on 10/23/62 a communist infiltration investigation of

this organization was initiated. (100-438794)

DETAILS:

The "New York Times" quoted King as stating he agreed with report

stated "Agents of the FBI in Albany, Georgia, sided with segregationists. " "One

of the great problems we face with the FBI in the South, "according to Reverend

Mr. King, "is that the Agents are white southerners who have been influenced by

the mores of their community. To maintain their status they have to be friendly

with the local police and people who are promoting segregation. Every time I

saw FBI men in Albany they were with the local police force."

It should be noted

there are five Agents assigned to the Albany, Georgia, Resident Agency. One is

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: RACIAL SITUATION

Howard Zinn, the author of the report for the Southern Regional

Council, was mentioned in my memorandum 1l/15/52 and has been the subject

of a security investigation by this Bureau (100-360217). Zinn was reportedly

a member of the CP from 1949 through 1953 and attended CP meetings during

that period. Zinn is a history professor at Spellman College in Atlanta. It

was the second slanted and biased document written by Zinn on the Albany

situation.

Reverend Mr. King is the President of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference who arose to prominence during the 1955 - 1956

successful boycott which ended bus segregation in Montgomery, Alabama.

He has been active in Negro segregation matters since that time.

N1-694-Sa top=level niormant, has advised that Stanley Levison,

a secret-CP-member, sent word to Gus-Hall General Secretary, CP USA,

during February, 1962, that King is a-wholehearted Marxist who had studied

it,-believed in it andagrees with it. He cannot however, puplicly eswouse

it in view of his position as a minister of religion. Levison is an associate

Director-Of the Southern Christian Leadership Conterence and 1s actively

involved in the operations of that organization.

The New York representative-of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conterence IS-Hunter Pitts ODell Who was elected under a pseudonym, Cornellus

James, to the National Committee of the-CP USA in December, 1959. On-31/7/62

James-Jackson then Editor of "The World" told-NY=694-SX that-an article attributed

to King-in-the in-the-3/3/62"issue-of"Fhe Nation" magazine was actually written by

O'Dell. The article was captioned, "Fumbling on the New. Frontier, and purports

to-bera-report.on_Civil Rights.

NY-694-S* advised that Lement Harris. CPJSA functionary, had

commented-that-stanley Levison by reason of his association. with the Martin

Luther-King Movement was doing the most important work-in-the Cp at that

time. - Harris stated The-party-has the Kennedys in its pocketsince the

Kennedy Administration is politically dependent upon-King.

This was furnished

to the White House and to the Attorney General on 5/4/62.

NY 3580-*advised on 8/7/62 that while in conversation with O'Dell,

Levison asked how things were in-Albany, Georgia. O'Dell replied that there

was a leadership problem down-there and things could get quite disorganized

if "our" staff was not there.

Clarence Jones, a member of the Labor Youth League in 1954 (a cited organization)

and Levison were discussing burning of churches in the South, both expressed the

opinion that King should not be silent in this matter but should send a hot wire to

"Kennedy" expressing his indignance at the Government's failure to control one

small community. This was furnished to the Attorney General on 9/11/62.

RECOMMENDATION:

Consideration has been given to contacting King to straighten him out;

however, this seems undesirable in view of the above facts and it is recommended

he not be contacted.

The hackground informa tion regarding King, Tevison and Zinn has

been furnished to the Department.

The Department and the Attorney General have been publicly

criticized on many occasions by King and yet they are cooperating with him.

It is recommended that the Liaison Section of the Domestic Intelligence

Division bring King's comments in the article to the attention of Staff Director

Berl I. Bernhard of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights and point out to him

that there is no basis in fact for King's remarks and in addition point out that 4

the 5 Resident Agents assigned at Albany, Georgia, are from northern states and

one is from Georgia.

That this memorandum be referred to the Domestic Intelligence Diyision

MARTIN LUTHER KING, '

INQUIRY FROM CONGRESSMAN WILLIAM STANTON (R. - OHIO),

By letter dated 4-17-67, Congressman Stanton wrote

the Director asking if he would have someone stop by his office to ? (

furnish him information for his personal edification concerning the

• 161

background and philosophical beliefs of Martin Luther King: He

says he has always tended to "take with a grain of salt some of the

literature that has accused him (King) of being a known Communist, '4

adding that there is no doubt in his mind that king is being used by

thom.

•?

Congressman Stanton began service in Congress in

January, 1965, and was re-elected last November. He was contactea

in 1965 under our program to meet new members of Congress and

exhibited a friendly attitude toward the FBI, commenting he has a

number of friends in the Bureau. The Director has exchanged

• correspondence with him on one prior occasion concerning a speech

invitation.

King's recent prominent role in anti-Vietnam

demonstrations has renewed interest in his political beliefs. Carl

Rowan wrote an article which appeared in the April 14, 1967, issue

of the "Evening Star" concerning the reputed struggle going on among

the advisors for King. This article states that, "Key members of the

House and Senate have been told by the FBI that King is listening most

to one man who is clearly more interested in embarrassing the United

States than in the plight of either the Negro or the war-weary people of

Vietnam." This articlé was reprinted in the Congressional Record of

April 17, 1967.

RECOMMENDATION: -

That a representative of your office personally contact

Congressman Stanton and explain to him that we can neither confirm

nor refute the rumors about King due to Departmental orders

holding information in our files as confidential.

On this date I saw CoveInoI JOHN VULPE of Massachusetts

and upon his complete, unqualitied agreement that he would not

disclose the infornation and would never attribute it as coming

from the FBI, the matertal relative to KING as suggested by

the Bureau was given to Governor VOLPE. The Governor's immediate

reaction was that he was concerned that this thing had gotten

too fat off the ground for him to be in a position to do anything

about it. lowever, he innediately indicated that he, In arI

probability, would be out of the city or certainly on

the

basis of some reason, unavailable.

UNREA

The Governor was most appreciative of receipt of the

formation and indicated that while he did not know at this par

ticular time what, if anything, could be done he would do whatever

he could, diplomatically, to play this thing down. He further

indicated, however, that

so many of the cleigy of various

denominations and other people of political stature are behind

this affair that it would be extremely difficult to play this

affair for kid dow but repeated he would certainly do whatever

Carmichael

On Campus

ATLANTA - After Stokely

Carmichael became the chairman

of the Student Nonviolent Coord-

inating Committee almost a year

• ago,

he embarked

on a program

to win a following for the organi-

zation's

new

"black power-black

consciousness" philosophs.

He and the organization's field

arcas, but ran into opposition from

Negroes who decided such black

power slogans as "move on over or

we'll move on over you" caused

more trouble with shites than they

solved. The Strtmit Comittce tried,

too, to stir up interest in big-city

But therc, its policy

opposing the presence

social workers stirred the animos-

ity of Negrocs who had received

tangible assistance from the work-

ers and liked them for it.

But in recent months he and his

organization have been devoting

increasing attention to Negro col-

lege campuses. And they are meet-

ing with more success.

At Tougaloo College on the out-

skirts of Jackson, Miss., last week,

Mr. Carmichael lashed out against

the war in Vietnam and had ap-

proximately 700 students shouting,

"Eell no, we won't go," in a chant

that lasted for a full 10 minutes.

A few days before, after ne ap-

peared in Nashville, Tenn., students

at predominantly Negro

Tennessee A.

and Industrial) Universities rioted

Molotov cocktails and took pot

shots at police cars.

Whether or not Mr. Carmichael's

presence had anything to do with

the riot is a matter of sharp de-

bate in Nashville, but Mr.

michael seemed to draw satisfac-

shouted "black power" while riot-

A 'Rebellion'

in his speech at

and said Negrocs need

not apologize for rebelling at in-

justices imposed upon them by

whites. Afer all the United States

would still be a colony it it had

not rebelled from Britain; and if

Negro ghettes want to fice them-

"colonial domination"

by whites, they may näre lu use

violence as a tactic.

Just how much support this sort

of talk is gaining the black power

movement on college campuses is,

of course, a matter of some con-

jecture. As might be expected, Mr.

Carmichael has his share of cam-

pus opponents.

But Mr. Carmichael has support

ers at Miles as well as at such

colleges as Fisk and Tougaloo. And

at the campus book store at Ala-

bama's Tuskegee Institute, two of

the best sellers are black power

"bibles" — Malcolm X's autobi-

ography

and

Frantz

Fannon's

"Wretched of the Earth."

What's the secret of Mr. Car-

michael's campus appeal?

for one thing, many students

admire his audacity. He drew more

than a few chuckles recently when

he walked into a Federal court in!

Selma,

and a flowing Nigerian "agbada

robe.

Jokes About Sex

And he provoked gales of cam-

pus laughter with his frank dis-

cussions of interracial sex. If a

white man asks if Negroes want

to marry his daughter, Mr. Car-

michael says, student committee

workers never shrug it off and run

the risk of seeming inferior by

saying, "We don't want to be your

brother-in-law, we just want be be

your brother."

na her

Carmichael

says.

"The

white

woman's notl the queen of tho

world, She can be made, just like

anything else. Let's move on th

something important."

Some students also admire Mr.

Carmichael's violent militance. He

calls white people "honkies."

for example, and says that nor-

violence strips the Negro male

of

his manhood. One way, he suggests,

for Southern Negroes to regain

their manhood is to strike back at

whites when whites strike at them.

Theory of Guit

There are obviously

swers to Mr Carmichael's appeal

and many of his campus speeches

have left college professors search-

ing for them. Some professors, in

their more philosophical moments,

have suggested that many Negro

students feel guilty about attend-

ing college and enjoying middic-

class advantages while millions of

their kinsmen are below the pover-

ty level. Mr. Carmichacl, the theo-

ry gocs, otters them a way to

help: Inspire the Negro masses to

stand up for themselves by being

truculent and not letting the white

man push you around,

Whether Mr.

Carmichael

right or wrong about this keeps

many students up past midnight

in debate. Meanwhile,

michael seems certain to go on

providing more grist for

"I'm denied power by honkies,"

Mr. Carmichael said,

Dilemma

as a Public Fact

By ifichael Harrington

Author of "The Other America"

• the back of the bus. Martin Luther

King Jr. has taken a militant stand on

a Iano inctear of nonfining himself

to the race issue. He is being, quite a

few editorialists seem to

uppity Jeremiah.

Ring obviously could not take the

advice to segregate his moral prin-

ciples to one question. And yet in

joining the Spring Mobilization to End

the War in Vietnam, the Nobel peace

laureate involved himself in a cruel

paradox. The man who, more than

anyone in his generation, had demon-.

strated the practical power of morality,

suddenly found himself torn by the

conflicting clains of politics and ethics.

I take his personal dilemma as a pub-

lic fact, a point of departure for under-

standing the crisis of the peace and

civil rights movements, the alienation

of the young activists and the way in

which a tragic conflict in Southeast

Asia corrupts our domestic hope.

An Inelastic Principle

AM SURE that King did not have a

I moment's hesitation in deciding to

oppose the war. He had taught South-

ern Negroes to love the racists who re-

viled and beat them and there were

those who died in practicing his non-

violent resistance to unjust laws. It is

preposterous to think that such a man

could possibly support the Administra-

tion's Vietnam policy. His pacifist prin-

ciples could hardly stop at the water's

-edge.

Secondly, King rightly argues that

the current retreat from issues like

poverty and race is, in part, a conse-

quence

of the war. It is not just that

one year's appropriation for Vietnam

could more than raise the income of

êvery citizen above the poverty the or

WW 55245 DooId: 32989661

Page 106

that two years of war funds would pay

for the housing program which Sen.

Ribicoff has projected over a decade.

In terms of economic quantities, this

Nation is rich enough to have both guns

and butter. But a society which listens

to a body count every night before

dinner is hardly being prepared for the

politics of compassion, either domestic-

ally or internationally.

It this logical convergence of the

peace and civil rights problems extend-

ed to politics, King would have no prob-

lems. But, of course, it doesn't.

A great many Americans felt that a

Jim Crow law was such an obvious sed

immediate abomination that it should

ba flouted. A much smaller number

applies this rationale nê civil aisobedi-

ence to opposition to the Government's

position on Vietnam. Thus King's radi-

cal anti-war stance will lose him the

support of some of those who approved

heartily of his radical anti-racism. It

ill even isolate him from some of th

roposals of the senatorial doves. :

was this potential contraction of the

civil rights base that so alarmed the

NAACP and led it to condemn his

march yesterday.

A Numerical Problem

IRONICALLY, these complexities

emerged at the very moment when

the civil rights movement desperately

needed allies. King himself had failed

in his Chicago open housing campaign

of 1966 and his defeat was symotomatic.

Where a lunchroom can be integrated

by a courageous handful, the abolition

of the ghetto requires that Congress

make massive investments in the name

of the entire Nation. This means that

the 10 per cent Negro minority has to

round up every possible vote; that

there will be fewer dramatic confronta-

tions and more politics. Some of the

militants, who found it easier to face

death in Mississippi than compromise

in Washington, responded to this new

situation by moving from civil rights

to. peace.

Had King been able to satisfy his

convictions simply by seconding the

senatorial doves, the decision would

have cost him little. But the courageous

proponent of nonviolent civil disobedi-

ence could not content himself with

such an impersonal, uncommitted

gesture.

His philosophy and his history drove

him toward the radical wing of the

peace movement,

where

he

found

friends more difficult to deal with than

many of his critics. The overwhelming

majority of peace marchers are people

who have been appalled by America's

conduct in Vietnam and seek an end to

the tragedy by any possible means. But

there is a smaller, extremely active

group

with a much more complex

motivation.

Perhaps the best way to describe

these people is that they are not at

all like the Communists of the '30s, In

those bad old davs. there was pies

problem when a core of members in an

American organization would act in

response to the twists and turns of

Russian politics.

Their attitude

on

Franklin Roosevelt, say, would depend

on Joseph Stalin's relations with Adolf

Hitler.

The young hyperactivists one meets

in the peace movement today are not

acting out this pattern at all. They are

not the puppets of Ho Chi Minh or any

other foreigner. Their basic emotion is

one of domestic alienation rather than

of international solidarity, and it is

their passionate feeling about their na-

tive land that determines their attitude

toward Hanoi, not the other way

around.

The Heartsick

THE PEOPLE of whom I write in-

clude Negro militants-SNCC vet-

erans, black nationalists and others-

who have become disillusioned with the

nonviolence of King and made heart-

sick by the token progress purchased

by terrible sacrifice. They are middle-

class college students who once naively

believed in the liberal thetoric that be

sets this country from all sides excert

extreme right and who reacted

with a bitter fury when they glimpsed

the illiberal reality.

It is these people who give the pres-

ent radical anti-war movement its dis-

tinctive quality. When they launch offi-

cial slogans analogizing the Vietcong to

Washington's army in 1776, when they

speak of "self-determination" but effec-

tively restrict the notion to South Viet-

nam and fail to extend it to the North,

even when they fly Vietcong flags, as

a minority among them do, they are

not conspirators or infiltrators.

Rather, they are expressing the anger

they feel about the United States. This

attitude certainly allows for individual

purgation but, and this is a problem

for King, it has litle to do with effec-

tive political action. Perhaps the Negro

leader can infuse this movement with

ne spirit of practical prophecy that h

ummoned upon from Montgomery t

Selma. And perhaps not.

Au Impossible Choice

FINALLY, Dr. King has made his

share of tactical errors, (like th

nolied equation of the American mil

sympathetic with him. He has beer

forced to an impossible choice. It is

resultant, and

dilemma is but one more cost of the

tragic war.

During the Eisenhower '50s when®

America was so often uncritically cele-.

brated, the spokesmen for the Nation's

conscience were often black men, and

Martin Luther King was a leader

among them. Eventually, this Negro

minority probably did more for the

whites than they did for themselves,

for it was the freedom movement that

awakened the campus, challenged the

churches to a new ecumenicism and.

prepared the way for that generation

which was to answer John F. Kennedy's:

call to action.

Now, in the agony of Vietnam, Amer-,

ica is forgetting that social conscience,

it so recently acquired. There are even:

PURPOSE: To obtain approval to furnish a suggested list of

questions to a friendly news source to be used in interviewing

Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference.

BACKGROUND: King has been on a two-month vacation in Jamaica

writing a new book.

During this time he has been attempting

to determine what direction he should take in regards to

national issues.

His inclination is to direct his entire

eriorts in opposition to the war in Vietnam.

During the past.

two weeks, he has started making public appearances again.

In California on 2/25/67 he attacked the war in Vietnam and

suggested quitting Vietnam, according to an article in "The

New York Times."

At one point he made a statement that

might be considered revolutionary. He stated in part, "we

have got to get out and demonstrate and protest until

rocks the very foundations of this Nation."

Also, while King was out of the country, the voter

registration drive in Chicago failed miserably.

He is very

sensitive about this failure and feels it hurt his public

image.

Fe is also sensitive about allegations his

personal

appeal to the ghetto Negro is waning..

Another factor that is infuencing his decision

is Reverend James Bevel's leaving his post as Project Director,

representative could arrange for an interview ostensibly

to question King concerning his new book. During the

interview the above-interrelated activities could be

developed, particularly to bring out the political.

reorientation of King's major efforts in relation to

United States foreign policy as contrasted to the position

taken by other civil rights leaders who have continued to

direct their efforts at civil rights.

This then could be

linked to show that King's current policies remarkably

parallel communist efforts.

This would cause extreme

embarrassment to King.

Further, it is felt that since the

position®

and paths taken by King and his group closely

parallel that advocated by the Communist Party, this fact

should be made known to the public.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

• That the attached list of questions be furnished

the Crime Records Division in an effort to interest a

friendly news media representative in interviewing King.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

SECURITY MATTER - COMMUNIST

Sergeant Edward McClellen,

Human Rotafons unt

Chicago, Illinois, Police Department, advised that on 2/3/66

Martin Luther King, JI., President,

Southern Christian Leadership

was in the nature of a courtesy visit, at King's request, during

which king reportedly informed the Archbishop of the nature and

purpose of his campaign to end segregation and discrimination

against the Negro in Chicago. King has selected Chicago to be

the site of the first SCLC invasion into the northern civil

rights problem. It is recognized by King that the future of

his organization may well, rest in the cuccess or failure of

the

ISCLC Chicago program.

King stated at a press conference, after his meeting

with the Archbishop, that he and Archbishop Cody were in sub-

stantial agreement upon the goals they were both seeking and

intended to keep in touch with each other. King declared he

was hopeful of the active participation of priests and nuns in

connection with his SCLC program in Chicago and had

gained the

Inpression from the Archbishop that such participation was a

matter of individual conscience and would not be a matter of

discipline insofar as the Diocesan hierarchy was concerned.

King continues to tely heavily

on the advice of his

New York foursome, Stanley Levison, Harry Nachtel, Clarence

Jones and Bayard Rustin,

in', connection with aft' major SCLC

Trottems and activities: These individuals have all been

members of the communist Party of Communist Party front groups

In the past.

As long as King utilizes these advisors with

subversive

backgrounds, the danger remains that his SCLC

activities will be influenced by communist-oriented thinking.

Re:

MARTIN

LUTHER KING, JR.

100-106670

King's meeting with Archbishop Cody has been discussed

with Special Agent in Charge Marlin W. Johnson of our Chicago

Office.

Johnson has given assurance that he can talk to

has givene

Archbishop Cody in complete confidence and Archbishop Cody will

not violate this confidence.

Bureau files show that

Archbishop Cody, while serving as a Bishop in the St, Louis

At that time,

It is felt it would be desirade i have spect tee

in Charge Johnson brief Archbishop Cody regarding the

subversive backgrounds of King's key advisors and to emphasize

to the Archbishop the vast influence these individuals exert on

In addition, Special Agent in Charge Johnson would

disclose to the Archbishop King's own sordid immoral activities.

Such a briefing would benefit the Archbishop in determining the

degree of cooperation his archdiocese will extend to King's

program in Chicago and would probably result in a lessening

of King's influence in Chicago.

This would be a serious blow

to any possible communist attempt to exploit King's program in

Chicago.

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that Assistant Director Sullivan be

authorized to telephonically contact Special Agent in Charge

•Johnson and instruct him to brief Archbishop Cody regarding

the strong influence being exerted on King by his key advisors

with communist backgrounds and to inform him of King's own

hypocritical Immora- behavior. Special Agent in Charge Johnson

will inform the

Archbishop that under no circumstance may there

ever

be any attribution to the FBI for the information furnished

him.

He said

he thanked me very much for talking to him because he knew this was an

unusual kind of thing to have happen.

My. Pila

He sald he wanted to ask me very seriously, but he was sure I was

familiar with this and given thought to it already, but he wanted to report on

the basis of their story that was rin yesterday about the authorization that

the FBI had from Mr. Robert Kennedy, to release the King material; that

they are getting a great deal of static from people who are telling them -

they say they have this authorization, but they don't release it and don't show

what the documents are and many of these documents that have been released

in the past are fuzzy and don't really show there was clear authorization to

do this and in general there is a nondisposition on the part of the readers to

accept the idea that Bob Kennedy actually did authorize the tapping of King's

phone. He said, "Now I just want to ask you as seriously as I can to release

those documents. You have them. They do show, I presume, exactly what

you say. "

I told Me. Noyes that he authorized it in his own handwriting on

October 10, 1963; it was installed November 8, 1963, and discontinued

April 30, 1965, I told Mr. Noyes that, as a matter of fact, when Kennedy

was Attorney General he requested that the telephones of Dr. King be covered

by electronic device and was persuaded by our people not to do it in view of.

the possible repercussions, then later he changed his mind and delayed

bringing the matter up again until in October the authority was signed by him

in his own handwriting and it gave us the authority to do it and we discontinued

it on April 30, 1965, under the administration of Attorney General Katzenbach.

Mr. Noyes said he understood and asked if they could report this. I toid him

line on this is that Mi. Tolson wrote (Carl) Rowan about his slanderous column

last Sunday and he, Rowan, wrote back in which he asked a series of eight or

nine questions, such as, did we tap the telephone of a half dozen leaders lice

Wilkinst., oi the NAACe, farmer, eight.or nine others, Abernathey; or if we

had tapped the phones of a Congressman; and various other things.

Nir. Noyes

said he was not asking all that. I told him he could certainly print what I say

because we are writing back to Rowan today that since he aid not seeks any facts

belore printing his column, he was not entitled to any information from us at

this time, but as to the question he has asked, the dates that these wiretaps

were on, I have the original copy of it on my desk. It was signed by Kennedy

in his own handwriting on October 10, 1963.

Mr. Noyes said if I had one minute, could he repeat back to me what

he understood I had said to him so there would be no misunderstanding and also

could he teld me that he was adding into it some details that he thought they

already understood about this from other sources they have talked to.

He said it was his understanding that in June, 1963, Mr. Kennedy

did suggest through a liaison man that he had with me, that i should keep an

eye on Martin huther King because of his association with people that he,

Robert Kennedy, Was concerned about and he, Noyes, was particularly talking

about Stanley Levinson and a fellow named Jones, both of whom were supposed

to be of Marxist leanings and that the Attorney General was concerned about

King's relations with these people and he thought it might be a good idea to put

an electronic surveillance device of some type into the picture to see what he

was doing; that the FBI suggested at that time that this would be a difficult

thing to do because of the fact that king traveled around so much and there were

a lot of political repercussions that might result; but then subsequently on the

7th of November (and I corrected him and told him October 7, 1963) -- on

October 7, 1963, I reported, and this is a memorandum from me to the Attorney

General, a four-paragraph document, that i had determined the feasibility of

establishing taps on the telephones of the SCIC headquarters at Atlanta and

New York and if he authorized it, I was prepared to go abead and do it and that

came back to me, the memorandum, with his initials. I told him with his full

name, Robert E. Kennedy. Mr. Noyes continued - o.Ie'd by him, dating that

10/10/63. I told Mr. Noyea that was correct.

June 19, 1969

Mr. Noyes continued that it was his understanding that I had no

objection to his using this -- is it o.k. for them to identity the FBI as

the source or flatly say it on their own. I told him I fould rather he fatly

said it on his own, but I anticipate similar requests from other souces that

I would not be as frank with as I have been with him. Mr. Noyes said O. B.;

that he thought this is a wise thing for me to do.

He said if I had one more minute, he would like to tell me one

leason shy he happened to be interested in this thing. Hesaid he had some

young people with whom he was friendly who were involved in a wedding

this weekend and the boys and girls all ended up at his house after the thing

and he did not know whether they had read Rowan's column, but theye were

talking about the fact now dreadful it was that the FBI would have presumed to

tap the phone or keep an eye on wartin Luther ring, a great hero. Be said

aiter listening to this for about an hour and & had, he told them to hold on

a minute, that it was his understanding that the Bureau had been checking on

King because there had been allegations that he had been in touch with

recognized or potential communist agents and the reason nothing was ever

released or done about it was that after checking into it, they became

satisfied there was nothing dangerous and he asked them what they would

think of a Government that did not check into information that seemed to show

that communist agents were trying to work on a man in Martin Luther King's

position. He said these kids listened and were astounded that there might be

another side to it, and he was telling me that this was taken by Bobby Kennedy

from the point of view of the generation gap. Vir. Noyes said he thought this

is an important story. I said he became a kind of Messiah for the generation

gap and individuals who were pro-king and still are.

I told Mr. Noyes that as to the matter of electronic installations,

I have never authorized an electronic installation of any kind at any time

except with written approval of the then Attorney General and that goes right

down to today. I said I do not have authority to do it myself and I do not want

it as I feel the Attorney General should be the one to approve or not approve

electronic surveillances and we use it only in internal security cases and now

in organized crime. I said in organized crime, the authority has to be obtained

from the courts under the McClellan bill and in security cases - espionage,

communist activities - that"is approved by the Attorney General, which is

## Page 123

Memorandund for Messrs. Tolson, DeLoach, Sullivan, Bishop June 19, 1969

allowed under the McClellan Bill. I continued that the Rowan article indicated

we were promiscuously continuing this sort of thing without regard to restrictions

or regard to authority, so the truth of the matter is, I have never ever authorized

the installation of a technical electronie device except with the approval of the

Attorney General in writing and we have ot file the original documents that

support that statement.

Mir. Noyes said that when he first asked me, I said it was all right

"to cite the Bureau for the authority and then I indicated I would rather have it

come from them directly. He said if, in order to give this the authority it

should have, it is necessary for him to cite me for the authority for some of

this,

is that o.k. with me. I told him that normally I would say no; that I

would defer to his judgement because he knows more about the matter of

public relations and public reaction. I told him I have been astounded at the

reaction on this thing. I said some of these magazines, like Newsweek,

which is owned by the Washington Post, carried the Cassius Clay testimony

in Texas where he is on trial and where the use of the electronic device was

exposed, and they stated the Agent testified the taps were continued until

King's death. I said that is untrue and the Agent did not so testily. I said

in the King case, it was discontinued April 30, 1965. I told MI. Noyes that

if he thought it would be to the best interest of public relations in clearing

up any really serious doubts newspaper people have, I would have no objection

to being quoted.

• Mx. Noyes said he thanked me and he thought I was making a wise

decision in letting it come oul. He said he thought it may be one of the most

important stories of the year.

I told Mr. Nojas that when I read the Sunday paper and Rowan's

article I thought here is an individual who is a Messiah of the dissident left,

of which Rowan is a part, and yet it was done at the instance of Bobby Kennedy,

who later became a great friend of King's, notwithstanding he knew ad the

facts, as I kept him advised as well as every Attorney General since.

Mr. Noyes said there is one thing about this I should consider and

that is that he has the gist of what is in these things from me, but I will be

asked immediately to release them testually. He said he thought I ought to do it.

I told him I would have to get the authority of the Attorney General for that.

Mir. Noyes said that is another problem, but the text ought to come out. He

said it is very well for me to say what is in them, but the text ought to come

out. I told him I realized that. He said he fhought once before we had put out

photostats.

I told him a Congressman, Gross, made inquiry in regard to some

of Kennedy's authorizationsbefore he died and after he left the Attorney

Generalship. I said he denied he had approved certain authorizations and I

sent to the congressman serox copies of the authorization signed by Kennedy,

as he being a Congressman, I felt he was entitled to it, and/tien Attorney

General approved. I said in this instance, if we get a request from a Congressman

or Senator along the lines he indicated, I would submit it to the Attorney General

with my recommendation.

Mr. Noyes said i was going to get an immediate

request - within the next coupe of hours or as soon as he can get this out ..

from every news media for the text. I told him these were confidential

documents of the Department and can only be released as to the text by the

Attorney General.

Nr. Noyes thanked me.

I returned a call from Mr. Newbold Noyes and he told me he very

much appreciated my calling him back. He said he realized after we were

finished talking that there was this one rather crucial question that he had not

asked me and he did not know whether I could comment on it or not, but it

seemed necessary to ask it; namely, whether the investigation of Dr. King

did or did not reveal any suspicion o1 Marxist character.

• I told him I could not

answer that question to be quoted. I told him I could say to him off the record

and for his own information it did but I could not be quoted on that. Mr. Noyes

said he understood and that d understood the thing that most concerned him was

the possibility that it cleared him in which case it seemed to him essential

that they put it in the story, but they will handle it exactly as it is. I said it

did not clear him at all, but I cannot mention that because it would reveal the

confidential character of the investigation we made. Mr. Noyes again thanked

Re Paris letter 4-1-66.

As the Bureau Is aware, MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,

pas visited paris on two occasions within the past year.

on the first occasion KING preached a sermon, at the American

Church in Paris and spoke before a French Protestant church

group on 10-24-65. He returned with HARRY BELAFONTE for a

large rally held on 3-28-66 organized by the Martin Luther

sing Parts committee for civit Rights to raise money for the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

PAKIS,FRANCE

Although KING's first appearance in Paris in

October, 1965, was voluntary and in connection with a trip

to accept an honorary degree in Holland, he took advantage

of a previous invitation which had been extended to him by

American church in Parisy-to

SARGENT was one of the leading

forces in organizing the Martin Luther King Paris Committee

for Civil Rights, which sponsored the rally on 3-28-66.

I have been closely associated for a long

period of time with the American Church in Paris and I am

acquainted with MARTIN SARGENT on a close personal basis.

I have not discussed KING with SARGENT in detail but feel

that it would be advisable to do so.

Based on my personal

acquaintanceship with SARGENT I feel that I could do this

in such a manner as not to cause embarrassment to the Bureau.

• If the Bureau approves, it is. requested that

the Bureau

furnish me with a memorandum for guidance so

that I can discuss KING's background with SARGENT in an

effort to convince him that his continued support of MARTIN

LUTHER KING may result in embarrassment for him and the

JIM BISHOP, AUTHOR;

PROPOSED BOOK ON MARTIN LUTHER KING

You will recall that "Reader's Digest" has contracted with?' M. lares

Jim Bishop, a well-known author, to do a book on the Martin Luther King

assassination case. In contacts which Bishop has had with "Reader's Digest"

concerning this matter, it was indicated that the book by Bishop would deal with

the assassination of Martin Luther King and the hunt for, and apprehension of,

the assassin by the FBI. Such a book, of course, would be most favorable to the

FBI and our work in the case. We have not started working with Bishop in the ,

preparation of the book because of the fact that James Earl Ray has filed a

number of appeals in his case, one:. still being pending, and the Depart-

ment has not yet authorized us to begin working with an author in connection with

Ithis case.

On May 21, 1970, by referral from Mr. DeLoach's Office, I '

received a phone call from Jim Bishop from Florida. He stated that he had

recently had a conversation with Robert Cousins, an editor with Funk and

Wagnalls, which is the publishing house for "Reader's Digest, " about his

proposed book on Martin Luther King. Cousins indicated that he had been led

to believe by Hobart Lewis, President of "Reader's Digest,:

!that Bishop had

indicated an unwillingness to have his manuscript reviewed for accuracy upon

its completion. Bishop advised me that he has always submitted his manuscripts

for review to persons or agencies which have cooperated with him in the prepari-

tion of books and he would welcome such review by the Bureau in connection with

any book he may do on Martin Luther King.

NW 55245

At this point, Bishop indicated in his conversation with me that

what he has been considering in connection with the book regarding Martin Luther

King is a biographical book on King which would end with King's death and the

declaration of national days of mourning for King by the President. He indicated

that he was extremely interested in getting all possible information concerning

King from the FBI that he could, particularly that type of information which

Bishop to DeLoach memo (continued)

Re: JIM BISHOP, AUTHOR

I would show King's immoral character, the influence over him by subversive

elements, etc. He indicated that he was considering keeping his book strictly

one of a biographical nature rather than one which would deal with the details

of King's assassination and the Bureau's hunt for the killer and the apprehension

On June 1, 1970, you (Mr. DeLoach) telephonically contacted

[|| Bishop and advised him in no uncertain terms that it would not be possible for

the Bureau to furnish him any information whatsoever concerning King's

immoral character or his communist or subversive connections. He was

advised that this information was classified and had never been released by the

FBI to any source outside of the Government. He was told that, if and when we

get clearance from the Department to do so, we would be willing to cooperate

with him in a book which would treat solely with the assassination and the events

leading up to the identity and capture of James far. Ray,

the assassin.

-

Bishop advised you (Mr. DeLoach) that he had apparently been

under a misapprehension as to the type of book which "Reader's Digest" expected

him to write on Martin Luther King. He stated that he would be favorably

disposed toward doing a book dealing with the assassination of King, but he wished

to discuss the matter further with "Reader's Digest.""

Inasmuch as we have not yet received clearance from the Department

I to cooperate in the preparation of a book on the assassination of King, no further

action will be taken on this matter until such clearance is received and until

we are assured by Bishop that his book will treat with the assassination of King

rather than being a biography of him attempting to expose his immoral character

land communist connections.

RECOMMENDATION:

No additional action is recommended until we have received

clearance from the Department on this matter.

Right.

By letter of 12-4-70, captioned individual, who is well-

known to theDirector, and is on the Special Correspondents List, noted

that he has been researching a "clinical biography" of King for the past

a 1/2 years. He advises that he is interested in receiving various infor-

mation from us on the private life of King, including King's "extracurricular

sex life, " King's contact with communists, and his meeting with Mr. Hoover.

In your memorandum to Mr. DeLoach dated 6-1-70, you

referred to Mr. DeLoach telephonically contacting Jim Bishop on that

date to advise him in no uncertain terms that it would not be possibie for

the Bureau to furnish him any information whatsoever concerning King's

immoral Character or his communist or subversive connections. He was

advised that this information was classified and had never been released

¡by the FBI to any source outside of the Government.

As you will recall, Jim Bishop has previously been furnished

information on the King assassination which has been released by the

Department. Therefore, it is not felt any harm would result from furnishing

Jim Bishop only public source data we have available concerning some of the

l points he has raised in his letter on King.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON

MR. DE LOACH

ME. SULLIVAN

With regard to the technical surveillance and investigation of the

late Martin Luther King, Ji., I note that copies of the material were sent

to Carl T. Rowan, then Director of the United States Information Agency.

I further note that the material, particularly the over-all summary memo-

randum of December 2, 1904, was widely distributed to representatives

in the Government agencies. I think there should be greater discrimination

relative to the dissemination of highly contidential material. Certainly

Rowan, even though he was Director of the United States Information Agency,

should never have been urnished with this material in view of his known

racist activities. I note the same material was disseminated to Dr. Leland I

Hayworth of the National Science Foundation. i do not understand why he

should have been included on the list for dissemination, as certainly sing's

activities did not fall within the area of his Foundation.

Please initiate immediately a re-evaluation of the dissemination

of our highly sensitive and confidential information.

Very truly yours,

SUBJECT: ROY WILKINS

EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT

APPOINTMENT 11/27/64

FBI HEADQUARTERS

WASHINGTON, D. C.

-

Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary, National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People, called me from New York at 12:55 p.m. today.

He

stated that he had to fly down to Washington to see me immediately. He asked if I

had any availabie time.

• He apologized for attempting to arrange an appointment on what

he termed a "holiday weekende"' -I told him the "holiday weekend" made nọ difference

to us and that despite his unwarranted statements concerning the Director and the FBI,

I moald sit down and talk to him.

Wilkins arrived at 4:00 p.m. He stated that he was greatly concerned.

He made reference to the Director's Loyola speech last Tuesday, 11/24/64, in which

the Director had made reference to "sexual degenerates" in pressure groups. Wilkins:

stated he personally knew about whom the Director was talking, although many other

Negroes did not know. Wilkins added that he had received at least three newspaper

inquiries during the past two days from individuals inquiring as to whether King was a

Isexual degenerate or not.

Wilkins told me that he personally did not mind seeing King ruined.

He

stated the important part of the matter, however, was the fact that if King was ruined=

the entire civil rights movement would be ruined. Wilkins stated that he: personally :

knew that King was a "liar" and that he had little respect for him. He quoted an exami

of his wife stating last night at a Thanksgiving dinner with friends, upon being asked if

she knew of the terrible things that "Edgar Hoover had said about Reverend King beingg

a liar. " Mrs. Wilkins replied, "This doesn't surprise me because King is, a liar. "

Wilkins continued that while King is no good, his ruination will spell the downfall of the?

entire civil rights movement.

Wilkins told me that despite the truttumess of the sexual degenerate

alle ions and communist allegations against king, many of his Negro associstes.

Re: Roy Wilkins, Ay ointment 11/27/64

FBI Headquarters, Washington, D. C.

would jump to the defensive and defend King. On the other hand, however, many of the

white people who believe in the civil rights movement and who yearly contribute from

$500 to $50, 000 to this movement will immediately cease their financial support.

Wi sins added that the loss of financial support will be tremendous, however; the loss of

fa h in King by millions of Americans would be even vorse.. He stated the combination

lo the two would, of course, halt any further progress of the civil rights movement.

Wilkins told me that he and a number of the Negro leaders had attempted

i iveral months ago to get King to accept the presidency of a small college. He stated

King had refused to do this because he was accustomed to the hypocrisy of adulation

and to the money that was pouring in to him. He stated that King for some time now has

received from $500 to a $1, 000 per speech on the lecture circuit. He mentioned that

King receives considerable support from wealthy Negro and white people alike. He

"stated that obviously the best thing that the Negro leaders could do now would be to get

King to accept a position as Pastor of a large Negro church and thereby retire forever

as a leader Oi the Negroes.

Wilkins stressed the fact that he was not seeing me as an emissary... He

I stated he had some influence on King but not much. He added that there were others

within his movement who had greater influence and that perhaps together some pressure

could be brought on King. Wilkins then added that he hoped that the FBI would not

l expose King before something could be done.

I interrupted Wilkins at this point. I told him that the Director, of

course, did not have in mind the destruction of the civil rights movement' as a whole.

I told him the Director sympathized with the civil rights movement as exemplified by the

Director's supervision of the FBI's many brilliant accomplishments in this field. I

, added, however, that we deeply and bitterly resented the lies and falsehoods told by

King and that if King wanted war we certainly would give it to him. Wilkins shook his

head and stated there was no doubt in his mind as to which side would lose if the FBI

really came out with all of its ammunition against King. I told him the ammunition

was plentiful and that while we

were not responsible for the many rumors being initiated

against King, we had heard of these rumors and were certainly in a position to

substantiate them.

I told Wilkins that inasmuch as he was attempting to hold out the feather

of peace he should know a few positive facts of life. He asked what I meant. I told

him my point was that he was attempting to prevent the FBI from exposing King, yet

certain highly-placed informants of ours had tipped us off to absolutely reliable infor-

mation that King had organized a bitter crusade against the Director and the FBI. I

told Wilkins these long-standing and well placed informants had advised us that King

Re: Roy Wilkins, Appointment 11/27/64

FBI Headquarters, Washington, D. C.

had contacted people in various parts of the United States to get them to send telegrams

to the President, the Attorney General, and the FBI asking for Mr. Hoover's retire-

me t or resignation. I told Wilkins that King had also encouraged telegrams.to be

se t advising the FBI of laxness in the investigation of civil rights matters. I asked

W Ikins how in the hell could he expect the FBI to believe his offers of friendship and

request for peace when King was at this time attempting to ruin us. Wilkins merely

..

ing his head and stated he had no idea that King was carrying on such a campaign. He

; ated that this upset him greatly and made him all the more determined to initiate

action to remove King as soon as possible.

Wilkins stated that he had long noted King's sympathy toward the

communist movement. He told me this obviously stemmed from Stanley Levinson's

influence on King. Wilkins diverted from the subject of the conversation to spend some

time in explaining that he had also noted communist influence in the civil rights move-

ment in Mississippi. He stated that the cry of "Down with the Proletariat" was getting

to ho the battleery of the militant Negrces in Mississippi and Alabama,. He mentioned.

the same thing was true with respect to Negro allegations of laxness on the part of the

FBI. He mentioned that the Negroes have been led by King and Bayard Rustin to

believe that the FBI could do nothing right; consequently, FBI solution of civil rights

cases made little impression upon some Negroes in the civil rights movement.

Wilkins stated he was wrong in his criticism of the Director. He added

that he was attempting to accomplish, in a mild manner, a division between the battle

of the Director and King and any phases of the battle which would reflect upon the civil

rights movement. He stated he has a hard time controlling his 32-man Board of

Directors, particularly since King is a member of this board. He then added, "We're

hurting, " and something must be done.

Wilkins told me that he will be lecturing in California most all of next

week. He stated that before he leaves for the coast he will attempt to see King, along

with other Negro leaders, and tell King that he can't possibly win in any battle with the

FBI and that the best thing for him to do is to retire from public life. He stated he

may not have any success in this regard, however, that he is convinced that the FBI

can easily ruin King overnight, therefore, for the good of the civil rights cause King

should make definite plans to leave public life and merely be Pastor of a Negro church

in the future. I told Wilkins this, of course, was up to him; however, I wanted to

reiterate once again most strongly, that if King wanted war we were prepared to give

Enclosed is an article which we have

prepared concerning Martin Luther King. It is based

entirely on public source information and we are recom-

mending that it be referred to the Crime Records Division

with the idea that it can be given to a friendly newspaper

contact such as David Lawrence, who is Editor of the U,

News and World Report.

The article was prepared because the cry

of "black power" is a most timely issue in the country today.

This issue has split the civil rights movement and has caused

civil rights leaders to take sides for and against "black

However, Martin Luther king has been attempting

to straddle the issue, based on advice given him by his

advisors with communist backgrounds. The attached article

indicts king for his failure to take a stand on the iscue

and at the same time exposes the degree of communist influence

on him..

It is felt the public should again bo

reminded of this communist influence on King, and the

current controversy among civil rights leader's

timely to do so.

National Director Of the Congress of Racial Equallty (CORE),

saya it is. He reportedly conmented to that effect during a

panel discussion on October 25, 1966, at a Philadelphla

conference of radic-television broadcasters sponsored by the

Westinghouse Broadcasting Assoclation.: In addition, Hekissick

is quoted as having added that "what we have now is a black

revolution, for black people to take that they can for

themselves."

it the novement is dead, as Mckissick asserts, he

is one of tho individuals most responsible for its denise.

ickissick has loudly echoed the "black povert erles of

Stokely Carmichael, leader of the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee, and it has been their demands for

revolutionary action which stopped the civil rights movement

in Its tracks.

In so doing, they have brought to a halt ten years

of concentrated elfort on the part, of moderate Negroes and

whites who support the novenent. Then the movement began,

i seemed to signify the end of an era of disenchantment and

beginning of a period in which true justice and equality for

Responsible civil rigats leaders have been arpalled

at the harm done by the eries of "black pover." In audition,

they have taken a strong stand in an effort to right the

Wrong. Roy WilLinS,

A. Shildp Randoigh aad Whitney I. Young,

Fre, Joined sorces and lasued a publle statement in which

they clearly and unequivocally denounced "black power" and its

inherent danger to both the Negro and the Nation.

Unfortunately, their courageous action was unders

mined by the one man in the civil rights movement tho holds

in his hands the power to silence the rabble rousers and give

the novement renewed momentum. That man, of course is

Martin Iuther Kings J5., Those activities lave Invested him

with the mantle of leadership in the novement since st began

in Montgonery in 2956.

At first it appeared King had wholeheartedly joined

with Wilkins, Randolph and Young in their renunciation of

"black power." He reportedly endorsod their statement which

appeared in "The New York Fines" on October 14, 1966. For

the first time in many nonths, sillions had reason to belleve

and hope that the civil rights movement had rid itsell of a

cancerous grouth and would resume its progress with renewed

health and vigor.

Much to the anazement and disnay of wany, King

killed

this hope almost immediately. Within three days alter

the

statenent appeared denouncing "blach power," "The New Yort:

Tines" reported that King had "clarilied" lis position co

not wish to be included as a signer.

King's palliadlog and anbiguous position on the

issue is difficult to understand or justlay. Those tho csy

understood and nisderined. But the record is clear that

it stands for open advocacy of violence, insistence on an

allallegro organizational strueture in civil rights groups,

and reverse racian.

It is equally clear that these things are direct

contradictions of the principles underlying the legitinate

• Civil rights novenent: a nonviolent approach, combined

Negro hite action, and the elimination of racisu.

The great American tragedy of our time would be

the fallure of Hartin luther King, do to not i curiout

challenge walch "blach pover" represents to the civil righta

movement. His failure to do so would mean that for some

reason King is willing to let the Legitimate civil rights

novenent die. This, in turn, would seen to indicate that

King's goal is different than that of Wilkins, Randolph and

Younge

It appears that Ring's decision to stradale the

lonce on the lasue of "black power" vas & carefully

calculated one. ""The Atlanta Journal" of October 13, 1988,

reported that Ring, as head of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCIC), was having an important meeting

with his advisors. Undoubiedly the nove Wilkins, Randolph

and Young proposed to make through the issuance of public

statenent was know to King and he was seeking advice on

what his stand should be.

In this comestion, it is interesting to note

that the newspaper article identified King's advisors as

The backgrounds of Rustin, Jones, Levison aud

Wacktel raise serious questions regarding their degree of

influence over Martin Inther King, Jr. The Congressiousl

Record of August 13, 1903, fos example, indicated that

Rustin is a sast menker of the Communist Youth League and

attended the national convention of the Comunist Party as

In addition, Rustin reportedly traveled to Russia

in 1958 to participata in a communist propaganda spectacular

There are seports that Stanley Levison also has

acted as a counselor to King for & long period of bine.

As a matter of fact, he once held a position as a vice

president in the SCle. The Congressional Record of July 21,

1966, indicated Levison was & secret member of the Communiat

The spectre of communist influence on King is not

a new development. The nationally syndicated columist

concerning King's employuent in the SCle of an individual

PURPOSE: To obtain authorization for the attached

article

concerning Martin Luther King, JI.'s contacts with James R.

Hoffa to be given to a friendly newspaper contact for

publication.

INformanT

BACKGROUND: As you have been advised, NY:5496- Siestated

Clarence Jones, a former member of the Labor Youth League,

a communist-front orgaization, and now a principal advisor

to Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern Christian

in contact with Paul O'Dwyer,

New York City attorney and brother of former New York City

Mavor William O'Dwyer. Jones wanted O'Dwyer to arrange a

meeting between King and James Hoffa, President, Inter-

national Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen

and Helpers Union. Jones advised

that King is very sensitive

regarding this meeting and does not want

any publicity con-

cerning it.

If a meeting could be arranged, King, accompanied

by Jones, would be willing to meet Hoffa at Hoffa's convenience.

'Dwyer promised to help arrange this meeting. Hoffa's

previous record of freewheeling with union funds would

indicate a reluctance on his part to pour union funds into the

civil rights movement; a move which would accrue no direct

"benefit to him individually. This appears borne out by his

indicated reluctance to meet with King and thereby be con

fronted with King's version of his (Hoffa's) responsibility

to aid the 450,000 Negro members of Hoffa's union. by

contributing financial and moral support.

Disclosure of

King's transparent attempt to blackmail Hoffa with the large

Negro membership of Hoffa's union, to solve the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference's financial problems, would

cause an uproar among leaders of organizations having large

Negro memberships; pointing out their own vulnerability to

such a squeeze by any unscrupulous civil rights leader.

This

potential collusion between large labor unions and the civil

rights movement could also react to the detriment of the

unscrupulous labor leader could subvert the legitimate aims

and objectives of the civil rights movement to his own

purposes.

Re: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

100-106670

Public disclosure of King's intentions in this

instance appears timely, in that it points out Hoffa's

susceptibility to King's plot and the intention of

King to virtually engage in extortion to obtain needed

funds. Disclosure would be mutually embarrassing to

both men and probably cause King's quest for badly needed

funds to fail in this instance.

Both Washington and New York are buzzing with

the

fact that the union headed by the labor leader has

nearly a half-nillion Negroes in it. He is banking on the

fact that the lear of large-scale dissension vithin union

ranks by the Negro members will force the union leader to

acquiesce to his demands for financial support. However,

the union boss reportedly has several aces up his sleeve

INFORMATION CONCERNING DISSEMINATION MADE

BY BUREAU OF INFORMATION REGARDING MARTIN

LUTHER KING

Senator Daniel K. Inouye (D - Hawaii with whom we have

had limited bịt cordial correspondence), by letter of 8-13-69, has inquired

as to our dissemination of information regarding Martin Luther King•

Recommended that atached letter be directed to Senator Inouye advising

him that our dissemination was on the basis of the proper interest of those

to whom FBI disseminated and that no purpose would be served in identifying

those government officials.

;

By letter 8-6-69, Senator Inouye made reference to an article

• in the 7-27-69 issue of Parade magazine regarding the immoral conduct of

King, and the wiretap on King. Inouye inquired as to whether the FBI had

released any information obtained from the wiretap. By letter 8-8-69 Inouye

was advised that the FBI did not "leak" information regarding King and that,

in keeping with our responsibilities, we disseminated information concerning

King on a high-level basis within the Executive Branch of the Government.

In his letter of 8-13-69, Inouye asks for the identities of the officials who

received confidential information on King and inquires whether our letter

of 8-8-69 implied that these officials may have been responsible for any leak

of data on King. On this letter the Director noted "I am not implying anything.

H."

ST-113 REG-73 94-50653-18

The FBI has made dissemination of information on King to

various high levels of the Government including the White House, the Vice

President, the Attorney General, and intelligence agencies. We should not

disclose identities of the officials to whom we have disseminated information.

If we give Senator Inouye any such list, other members of Congress will

expect similar treatment in other Bureau matters. In addition; the furnishing

of any list to the Senator might also cause him to inquire of the officials on

the list whether or not they leaked any data on King, and causing them to

be displeased with the FBI for disclosing their identities as recipients of

sensitive information on King•

The purpose of this memorandum is to furnish you

information developed by a file review regarding allegations

of former Special Agent (SA) Arthur Murtagh in "The New York Times"

5/21/73.

My memorandum 5/23/73 indicated Murtagh alleged important

figures in the FBI tried to persuade community leaders in Atlanta

Georgia, they should not attend a banquet honoring King, with the

warning

that the Bureau had information about King that might

eventually embarrass those who aitended. He alleged that an Agent.

in Atlanta told him a top official from Washington called on two

religious leaders and the late Ralph McGill, editor of the "Atlanta

Constitution," to try to persuade them not to attend.

the attached copy of a memorandum from tormer Assistant

to the Director W. C. Sullivan to A. H. Belmont dated 1/21/65

indicates that Sullivan did talk at least twice with McGill and

discussed that subject and that McGill was to contact three

religious leaders.

REC: 8. 100-1046-74

"The New York Times" article also indicated that

Eugene Patterson, former editor of the "Atlanta Constitution,"

produced a recollection that a Special Agent of the FBI attempted

in the Spring of 1964 to have Patterson expose King's running around

with women while posing as a moral leader.

The attached memorandum W. C. Sullivan to A. H.

to this recollection by Patterson.

dropped by the office to discuss with me Martin Luther King, Jr. With

Burcau approval, I had previously given hcGild some ot the basic facts

concerning king's connections with communism and his linnoral behavior.

chill told me that on being advised of the facts concerning king,

he has remained completely silent. As a result, he is being questioned

by associates in Atianta, Georgia, as io why he

is not speaking out in

favor of king and why he is not taking an active part in the banquet

to be given King next Wednesday night.

McGilL. sald that he wouid never

disclose a confidence and, therefore, his only reply is that he no

longer is an admirer of Martin Luther King.

Further, he has talked

ith. some other- men who nave told. him of their knowledge of King's

immorality and their concern about it.

In view of this, he is tree

¡ to speak a little bit more in detall and says he has done so Iox it

¡can be attributed to the men with whom he has spoken.

McGill said that these men are Adlai Stevenson, Ralph Bunche,

and Harry Ashmore of the'Arkansas Gazette." He told me that Adlai

¡considers king to be a "very dangerous man" to the civil rights movement

and that something should be done about it: Ralph Bunche told NcGill

that he has never been an admirer of King's although he thinks King

has done some good things; that a few months ago he began hearing very

disturbing stories about King's immoral behavior. Bunche believes that

King should be maneuvered out of the civil rights field or else he

i will do it serious damage. Mr. Ashmore, likewise, informed McGill that

is had heard some time ago about King's

incredibly immoral activities.

lAstmore Is very disturbed over it and wishes something could be done

but he has no specific course to recommend.

Mit. McGill told me that following my first discussion with him

a few weeks ago he contacted a banker friend in Atlanta who was helping

to finance the banquet to be given King next Wednesday night.

The

banker was disturbed and said he would contact some other bankers also

MCGIII's

Irond and some of the bankers did take steps to withdraw but this

WaS

very quickly relayed to bankers in Faiti who were on the threshold

of an important financial deal with the Atlanta, Georgia, bankers.

They took the position that if the Atlanta bankers did not support the

Martin luther King party, thoir financial deal with these Georgia

bankors vas off. As McGill said to me, the aimighty dollar is still

extremely important and especially so with 'baniers, and as a result they

I got cold feet a: i decided to go ahead with financing king's party.

McGill told me that Archbishop Hallinan, Catholic leader 11

Georgia, an Episcopal clergyman and a Jewish rabbi are also quite active

in support of this party for king.

He said that he is certain that not

lone of these three is aware of King's immoral behavior. I told him

that in view of what Stevenson, Bunche,

and ishmore had told hin, he

might want to explore very confidentially and discreetly the subject

I matter with these three men. He said he would do this:

McGill told me that he thinks it is too late now, especially in

view of the financial interest of the Georgia bankers in the Halti deal;

to prevent the banquet from taking place.

However, McGill said he

would do what he could to encourage key people to limit their praise

and support of king as much as possible.

McGill also told me that he is taking steps through Ralphbunche

to get ley Negro leaders to unite in opposition to King and to gradually

force him out of the civil rights novenent 1f at all possible.

Mr. McGill said that he would like to have President Johnson know

three things-- (1) that from diverse sources he has learned of the

deceiving of sincere, good people in this Nation who have been supporting

King;@ that he regrets greatly that the banquet is being given in king's

honor next week in Atlanta but that it has gone so far that it is

probably not possible to head it off; and (3) that he belleves that the

very best thing that could happen would be to have King step completely

out of the civil rights movement and public life for he feels that 11

this is not done, sooner or later King will be publicly exposed and this

1i11 do irreparable harm to the civil rights movement in which he,

licGill and others are so interested and have worked so hard for,

and

likevise, it will do injury to different citizens of the country

who

have been

supporting king not knowing that he is of such low moral

character®

throe things, out that he wanted the Director to know that he 1s

froe to quote him on these three points to the President and free

to put all three things in any communication that goes to the

It is very refreshing to meet & man of McGill's stature in

the Lield of journalism who is so sincere and honest and desirous

of doing: the right thing. He is a very admirable man. Repeatedly,

fir. McGill told me that he will continue to stay with this problem

and to think about it, hoping that he mill devise some plan or

course of action that will help to take King out of public life.

licGill told me in a visibly disturbed manner that this problem

centering around King has caused him to wake up at night from time

to time and he is very upset over it. McGill explained that whilo

he has never been close to King or

king 15,

TIller began to think about possible ways and

(smeans of exposing King which would be of benetit to the Bureau./

While talking to Patterson on other matters, Miller theorized with

Patterson about men of questionable characier in public life and.

did Patterson think they should be exposed. Patterson took & strong

stand on the matter and said it would be a public service if some

people were exposed.

•Of course, no reierence at all was made to

King by Miller. Miller said that knowing Patterson personally andi

getting his views indirectly on this general subject matter leads

Miller to believe that if at any time in the future the Bureau

would want to utilize Patterson and his newspaper it could be

done

very securely.

I thanked Miller for his interest in this matter and told

him that this type of thing would be handled out of the Bureau

headquarters and that if we thought this particular person could be

utilized he would be advised but to take no action until that time.

Donald F. O'Donnell, Chief Counsel of the Senate

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (chaired by Senator John L.

McClellan) which currently is conducting the hearings concerning riots

and civil disorders, has requested information concerning the demon-

stration being planned by Martin Luther King, Jr., in Washington this

spring. King has publicly stated that he intends to conduct massive

civil disobedience in Washington this year unless specific demands

for congressional action to solve the problems of poor Negroes are met.

Enclosed is a brief summary of pertinent information

concerning King's plans for this event. The information contained

therein is of a public source nature.

In addition to furnishing the enclosed write-up to

O'Donnell, it is felt we should keep the leadership in the House of

REVEREND YOUNG AND REVEREND ABERNATHY

VISIT TO FBI HEADQUARTERS, JANUARY 11, 1965

SIPK

In my memorandum of January 8th, it was pointed out that Reverend

Young wanted to come to Washington today together with Reverend Abernathy and see

Mr. Hoover if possible. It was recommended and approved that the Director's regrets

be expressed and Leinbaugh and I saw these men at 2 p.m., today.

Foli

Both Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy seemed to be highly

uncomfortable during the interview. Reverend Abernathy started out as the spokesman

-for Vr. King out bogged dune salies Shortly and Reverend Young, who ic much more.

articulate, carried most of the discussion.

Initially, Reverend Abernathy said that there were three points they

wished to discuss with the FBI and he said the first of these had to do with communist

infiltration into the civil rights movement. He said that they all realized that Reverend

King, as the leading civil rights spokesman, was subject to persecution. He mentioned

the pamphlets which had been distributed showing a picture of King at a Highlander

Folk School meeting and he mentioned the constant problem of keeping communists out

of the civil rights movement. Reverend Abernathy said that Jack O'Dell had been

brought into Reverend King's organization but that O'Dell did have a bad background

and communist connections and that he had, therefore, been dismissed from the staff

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Reverend Abernathy said

that there had been statements made challenging VY. Ring's loyalty but that the truth is

Reverend King has always attacked communism in his speeches, in his book, and that

their entire movement is "clean" in this respect.

TX: 110

Tel N: 1 04670-730

Reverend Young then spoke up and mehtioned that both O'Dell and

Levinson had been possible problems and he said that in the past their organization

had tried to get assistance from the Department regarding the background of these

individuals but had been generally unsuccessful. Reverend Young said they had the

problem of evaluating such people and wondered what could be done.

I pointed out that the answer was very simple, that the FBI can't give

Mout intormation and that our fies are confidential. He wanted to low what the SCIC

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.

could do to protect itself or to get detailed information regarding individuals with

questionable background and he was informed that the House Committee on Un-

American Activities did have extensive records which were available to all citizens

and that this source could be of possible background assistance.

Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy said they hoped they could

come to the FBI privately and they were told that they should always feel free to come

to us at any time and they were reminded that Director Hoover had emphasized this .

point when he had seen them with Reverend King in November. Reverend Young

made some comment about a press release. He was told that the FBI had no intentions

) of making a release concerning their visit.

Reverend Abernathy spoke very generally, pointing out that people

were always "making charges" and "innuendoes" against Mr. King. He said there

are claims that Dr. King is getting rich and he is using organizational funds for

his personal use. Reverend Abernathy said the fact is Mr. King receives no salary

from the SCLC whatsoever.- I took occasion here to point out that certainly matters :.

relating to the usage of funds within their organization were of no concern whatsoever

to the FBI and that the FBI confined its activities strictly to its statutory limitations

and that we did not have time, let alone the authority to probe into other matters.

Reverend Young said it looked like there were some attempts to

smear and ruin the civil rights movement; that just lately there has been some new

evidence in this regard and that very obviously the activities of Mr. King and

the SCLC are under close surveillance. Young said that as a recent example, King

went to the home of Young's secretary while she was in the hospital so that he could

do some writing in private. Reverend Young said that shortly after King arrived in

the secretary's apartment he was tired, was taking pills that made him groggy and

went to sleep. Shortly afterwards he was awakened by a fireman who reported there

was a major fire at this address. King reported that after the fire trucks left, the

phone in the apartment began ringing but that no one would answer. Young said that

only he had known that King had gone to this apartment, but that he also had called

Reverend Abernathy and told him where King was and that as a result of this he was

certain someone had been tapping their phones.

Since Reverend Young had mentioned the possibility of surveillance,

he was asked if Reverend King believed he was being followed. Young said he had

no such information. He said he did feel though there must be some sort of con-

certed organized campaign that was being directed against King and the SCLC.

Young added that the SCLC takes for granted its phones are tapped and said he realized

the Government might have a legitimate interest in their official activities but

wondered about the governmental interest in people's private activities.

DeLoach to Mohr me no, 1-11-65

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.

I very carefully pointed out that certainly the FBI was not interested

in any matter beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. I explained carefully the very

limited use made by the FBI of. wire taps. I pointed out that wire taps were used

in certain major espionage cases, or in a kidnap case where a victim's life is at

st se, that there were very few such taps, and that each and every case required

tr: express authority of the Attorney Genera 1.

At this time both Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy interrupted

o say that they, of course, knew better than to imply that the FBI would be involved.

Reverend Abernathy stated that there were three points they had

wanted to discuss; communist infiltration, allegations that King was getting rich

on the civil rights movement and the third point had to do with allegations about

the personal life and moral character of King. Abernathy bogged down a bit at this

point and said that, "We all are human beings... We all make mistakes." I tried

to bring out what he meant and asked why he was making such statements. Abernathy,

said that he was not going to make allegations against the FBI but that some things-

were going on they just could.not. understand.

Reverend Young said that King had been receiving some letters

charging him with immorality, that these letters attacked his personal life and he

I pointed out rather lamely that "All humans make mistakes."

I told Reverend Abernathy and Reverend Young that a lot of people did

come to the FBI with rumors and stories and that as a matter of fact, we had heard

allegations reflecting on Dr. King's morality but that certainly we took no action on

such rumors. I emphasized that any prominent person or leader of a movement must

be most careful in his private life and that such a leader's reputation should be

above reproach. I also noted that these rumors regarding King were prevelant

outside the FBI.

Reverend Abernathy said there had been some problems in the past;

that when Reverend King goes to make a speech people always want to hold a little

party or reception for him and that there is alcohol at these parties. Abernathy

said as a Baptist minister King does not participate in drinking affairs but some-

times it is hard to avoid attending receptions where drinking does go on.

Reverend Young said that he was deeply concerned about irresponsible

usage of personal information on the part of scandalmongers and wondered if there

could be any "leaks" from the Government. He was assured that there were no leaks

from the FBI, that the Director ran a tight organization and that any irresponsibility

on the part of any Agent would not be tolerated. Young said he did not feel the FBI

was responsible and said that just the other day King had received a letter which

brought up the "female question," and added they have been getting 8 or 10 bad letters

a week.

DeLoach to Mohr me 10, 1-11-65

Re: Martin Luther Hung, Jr.

Here again he was asked why he was telling us this and Young replied

that they were worried and concerned, that maybe they were overly concerned, but

that it seemed the campaign against King had been stepped up since he had received

the Nobel Prize. Young spoke about constant threats to ruin King and threats on:

Kir g's life. He was told that if any threats were made which would come within the

F' I's investigative authority, the full facts shoud be made available promptly so that

t! = matter could be thoroughly run out and investigated.

Reverend Abernathy brought up the fact again that all men make

ristakes and blunders but that King had become the symbol of nonviolence and that

i would be tragic for both the North and South if King should be ruined and it some

demagogue like Malcolm X would move in and take over the civil rights movement.

He said it would be tragic if Dr. King were destroyed. He was asked if there was

vulnerability on Dr. King's part or if he was being blackmailed. He said that every-

body has skeletons in their closets and he said that Dr. King was really a moral

person, that he had a deep love for all of mankind--I refrained from commenting

here--and that King was very moral and that in the last year Dr. King had been --

especially careful to avoid any actions which could be misconstrued by racists and

others out to destroy King.

Reverend Young tried to get "down to brass tacks" but was unable

to do so. He spoke of the changing sex standards in the country, talked in general

terms about people being tempted and making bad judgments and spoke about the

spiritual nature of their movement and the fact that God uses "frail vessels" in

carrying out His precepts, knowing full well the weaknesses of men. I asked him,

as a minister of God, if he condored sex degeneracy. He replied that people have

different standards and different ideas as to what the sex norm is.

I made a final attempt to pin down the precise nature of their problem

but neither man would come out with any specifics--only statements that "they" were

trying to ruin King and the civil rights movement and that this would be tragic for

the whole country. Both ministers said they knew and appreciated the fact that the

FBI would not be a party to vilification of King and I said this was true, and that

while we naturally were aware of rumors concerning immorality on King's part,

we had no cause to look into such matters.

Reverend Abernathy said he wanted to be very frank and wanted to

raise a question as to whether some Agents might overstep their authority in the South

and might engage in actions which were not known to FBI Headquarters. I

emphasized this was absolutely impossible, that our Agents carried a very heavy

case load, that we knew what our Agents were doing at all times and always knew

their whereabouts.

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.

Both visitors said, of course, they accepted and knew this to be

a fact. They mentioned one incident of a Georgia Bureau of Investigation man

checking on one of their meetings. They also mentioned the possibility that private

investigators may have been hired to probe their activities.

They said they had no other problems and I assured them that they

should always feel free to call on us if anything should occur within our investigative

authority. Both ministers agreed to do so and added they appreciated the

opportunity of stopping by.

Throughout the visit, both Young and Abernathy were ill at ease

and it was obvious that neither of them could bring themselves to discuss an

Dear John:

DeleTe

I certainly regret that we haven't had a chance to get together

in the last several months. Both Mr. Hoover and I remember with a great

deal of pleasure your visit to FBI Headquarters. Perhaps on my next visit

to Chicago we can get together for lunch, if your schedule permits.

I wanted to call to your personal attention an article entitled

"FBI Sides With Dixte, Says King" which appeared in the November 20,

1962, issue of your newspaper and which contains a number of false and

unwarranted assertions by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., about the FBI and

the work of its Special Agents in the South. As I know you are interested

in fairness and accuracy, I thought you may wish to pass along to your

readers the true facts with respect to Dr. King's charges.

One of the unfounded statements by Dr. King during his New

York interview was "because FBI agents have sided with segregationists,

• they have not investigated beatings and other intimidations of Negroes who

are fighting for equality in Albany, Ga, or surrounding areas." Perhaps

Dr. King has had a lapse of memory in recalling that last August and

September five Negro churches were burned in Georgia and firearms were

discharged into several homes. Based upon indications that the purpose of

these acts was to discourage Negroes from voting, the FBI instituted extensive

investigations which led to the prompt solution of the burning of a church in

Terrell County, Georgia, on September 17, 1962, and to the charging of two

officers in official performance of their duties and he is presently out on bond

awaiting Federal Grand Jury action. These two Agents were both born, reared

and educated in the North.

Dr. King also asserts, "One of the great problems we face with

the FBI in the South is that the agents are white Southerners who have been

influenced by the mores of the community. " His solution "was for the federal

government to consider assigning agents from other parts of the country to the

South and 'who are at least in agreement with the law of the land,'" according

to the newspaper article.

While FBI Agents throughout the country carry out their investi

gative responsibilities irrespective of their state of origin, four out of the five

Agents assigned to the Albany, Georgia, Resident Agency come from states

other than Georgia--New York, Indiana,

Massachusetts and Minnesota.

The other statements by Dr. King reveal a total ignorance, not

only of the true character of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, but also of the FBI

record in protecting civil rights.

As an example of merely one aspect of our extensive operations

in the civil rights field, I cite the matter of voting. In the past several months,

the FBI has conducted investigations involving more than 100 counties in which

racial discrimination was alleged to exist. The Department of Justice has been

furnished the results of these investigations; and based upon them, over 30

saits in counties of five states have been filed by the Department for the purpose

of ending racial discrimination in voting.

As a result of FBI investigations and court actions based thereon,

thousands of previously disenfranchised Negroes have been enabled to register

to vote in accordance with their rights under the Constitution andlaws of the

United States. For example, in one area where no Negro had voted in 40 years,

Negroes entered polling places in September; 1962, and cast ballots.

It should always be borne in mind that the FBI is strictly an

investigative agency. Our investigations are conducted with dispatch and

thoroughness. Contrary to many beliefs, we do not render prosecutive opinions

nor handle the prosecution of cases. This, of course, is proper in a Republic

such as ours.

You may be sure that the FBI will continue to carry out its

manner. However, irresponsible charges do little to promote such goals.

I trust my comments will serve to put the issues raised by Dr. King in their

proper perspective, and I know you would want to have these facts in view of

your record in reporting the news in an Impartial and objective style.

Pursuant to instructions, I saw Dr. Carey, who is known to

Mr. Tolson and the Director, at 12:30 p.m. today in my office.

Dr. Carey told me that he knew that time was limited at FBI Headquartri

so he would come right to the point. He stated he had come to see us on behalf of

Martin Luther King. He added that King was in Chicago last weekend and stayed in

Carey's home, and at that time indicated every evidence of great disturbance. King

told Carey he had been reliably informed there was a massive effort to discredit him

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This effort is to begin this week.

Carey told me that he wanted to enlist the sympathies of the FBiin not

letting any etfort to discredit King occur. He said he wanted to beg the usage of our

good offices to prevent such an occurrence from happening. He stated he was asking

for our assistance based upon good reasoning. He then mentioned those reasons as:

(1) Reverend King is a good man: (2) Reverend King stands as a "symbol"' to the

Negro race today. (3) Reverend King is a "safety valve" at the present time. He

explained this by indicating that Reverend King's articulate voice was preventing mor:

of the militant and violent Negroes from committing serious acts in the United States.

I interrupted Dr. Carey at this point and told him he had known us for a

long time and that I felt certain that he knew in his own mind that the FBI had plenty

to do without being responsible for a discrediting campaign against Reverend King.

Dr. Carey agreed that he did know us better and stated that he had doubted King's

allegations from the very beginning. I told Carey that Reverend King had criticized

us very unfairly, particularly concerning the background and investigative actions of

our Southern Agents. I briefed Carey very thoroughly on this point. I further told

Dr. Carey that King had later denied that he had made such allegations upon having an

appointment in Mr. Hoover's Office. I told Dr. Carey that the Director had given

Reverend King some very good advice insofar as his moral responsibilities were

concerned.

DeLoach to Mohr Memo, 5/19/65

RE: Dr. Archibald J. Carey, Jr.

Reverend Martin Luther King

I went into the entire situation with Dr. Carey and told him not only of

the many successes we had enjoyed in this particular field, but also of the dis-

couragements and humiliations that extremists on both sides attempted to subject us

¡to. Dr. Carey showed great interest and indicated that he would be one that would

lattempt to remedy that situation.

DO NOT. DENITE

Dr. Carey called me at 3:35 p.m. this afternoon and stated he wanted

to use about ten seconds in mentioning two additional things: (1) He stated that he

Ihad talked to King telephonically and remonstrated with King about the fact that king

should make a greater ertort to praise the t'bl for its excellent work inthe civil rights

field. (2) Dr. Carey Stated he wanted to be very immodest for a second. He added

that he felt he had done a great deal for the current administration and that despite

the fact that heswas the president of a savings and loan association; minister of a-large

Negro-church, and head of other business interests, he would still appreciate it if the

-Director would say a good word for-him to the President. Dr. Carey stated-he knew -

John Macy of the Civil Service Commission very well and felt that Macy would be on

his.side it any.appointment-came-up.told.Dr. Carey that the Director, of course,

regarded aim very nighty and would naturaly keep his request in mind although lt

might be presumptuous for the Director to make such récommendations to-the White

'House. Dr. Carey stated he could understand this. He again pledged-his loyalty

Debernd friendship.

DO NOT DELETE

ACTION:

Dr. Carey is the third individual that King has had come see us relative

to requesting that we not expose him. Roy Wilkins, Jim Farmer and Reverend

Abernathy have all been here for the same purpose. It is obvious that King is

becoming very disturbed and worried about his background, else he would not go to

such great efforts to have people approach the FBI. I did not commit the FBI in any

manner insofar as exposing King is concerned. To the contrary, Ilet Carey flatly

know of King's derelictions insofar as false allegations against us are concerned and

of the fact that King and other civil rights workers owed the FBI a debt of gratitude

they would never be abe to repay. For record purposes.

A sanitation workers strike has been going on in

Memphis for some time. Martin Luther King, Jr., today led a

march composed of 5,000 to 6,000 people through the streets

of Memphis. King was in an automobile preceding the marchers.

As the march developed, acts of violence and vandalism broke

out including the breaking of windows in stores and some

looting.

This clearly demonstrates that acts of so-called

nonviolence advocated by King cannot be controlled. The same

for Washington in April.

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, injected himself into the !

sanitation workers' strike in Memphis, Tennessee, and the

result of King's famous espousal of nonviolence was vandalism,

looting, and riot.

Previously, King involved himself in this strike,

called for a general strike, and called for a mass march.

Today he led the mass march

in an automobile at the head of

the line. Negroes began shouting "black power" and trouble

began. King, apparently unable or unwilling to control the

marchers, absented himself from the scene; window breaking and

looting broke out.

Police officers were forced to use gas to break up

the march and to control the crowd. It was necessary to

activate the National Guard. Martin Iuther King claims his

much-heralded march on Washington, scheduled for April 22,

1968, will also be "nonviolent."

He says he has persuaded

militant black nationalists to abandon violent extremism in

Washington, D. C., during the march. Memphis may only be the

prelude to civil strife in our Nation's Capitol.

At the request of Congressman Martin to see an Agent,

SA David W. Bowers called on Congresman Martin on July 1, 1965. The

Congressman related he will be obtaining within the next day or two copies

of a special Alabama Legislative Committee Report concerning various civil

rights organizations which have been active in the state. This report,

according to an article in the June 30, 1965, issue of "The Washington

Post'' (copy enclosed) contains allegations that various civil rights

organizations are communist infiltrated or dominated.

Congressman Martin declared ne 1s aware oi various

reports to the effect that Martin Luther King has a communist background

and is a sex degenerate. He said he has talked with the President about

this, urging the President to let the American people know the truth. Hẹ

said the President was somewhat condescending in his attitude perhaps

because. the Congressman is both an Alabamian and a Republican. The

Congressman stated he knows full well that as an Alabamian and a

* Republican he is not the proper person to expose Martin Luther King but

as an American he sincerely feels the people of the Nation should know the

truth about this man.

Congressman Martin wanted to know if he sent a copy of

the Alabama Legislative Committee Report to the FBI would we confirm.or

deny the allegations contained in the Report. He was told that this would nöt

be possible since information in FBI files is confidential. He then asked

where he might obtain some authoritative guidance as to the validity of the

Report. He was told that he might wish to consider forwarding the report

to the Attorney General with the request that the Department of Justice

advise him of its validity. He stated he would do this although he

seriously doubted that his request would be honored.

AMES MARTIN

Congressman Martin declared he is genuinely concerned

about the type of people who are involved in and heading the so-called

civil rights movement. He said, however, he does not intend to make

rash statements or charges which he cannot support with fact. He then

commented that he has in his files information regarding immorality on

the part of civil rights demonstrators. He stated on the day he called

on the President at the White House there was a demonstration in

progress wherein "beatniks" had been sleeping and sitting on the sidewalks

in front of the White House for some time. As he left the White House he

asked one of the guards present if there had been any immoral activities

on the part of the demonstrators since he noted males and females were

using the same blankets. He said the guard told him there certainly had

been.

Congressman Martin said he wrote the chief of police

asking about this and a month later received copies of numerous affidavits

executed by all the police officers on duty around the White House during

the demonstration. He said the gist of these affidavits was that numerous

officers observed movement under the blankets but took no action since they

were under instructions not to bother the demonstrators unless they started

trouble.

Congressman Martin said he considers what obviously

took place at the White House an utter disgrace.

Re:

communist Infiltration of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

Internal Security - C

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on December 13, 1967, that

Martin Luther King, Jr., and Stanley Levison discussed the,

Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC), of whick

King is president.

King said

that for the first time he has

noted. that some effective.administration is developing..

Levison told King he wanted to raise the question

with him of getting together a group of wealthy people,

specifically in connection with the civil disobedience

program, in order to get a special pledge of financing from

them.

He suggested they might even hold a two day retreat

to orient them and discuss the subject with them.

Levison

noted that they have a list of possibly ten to fifteen persons

'who have given the SCLC more than one thousand dollar

donations. He said that they might add a few others to

this group, but that they have to select a place for the

meeting.

Levison felt that they could tell those who attend

that they need a certain amount of money and what part each

will pledge. He said each of these persons might be able to

go to someone else because there will be a problem of

interpretation for middle-class whites and middle-class

Negroes.

• touch with King's office relätive to a possible article to be written

by Kuettner.

SAC Ponder of our Atlanta Office telephoned me about noon

today (5-24-65), made reference to the LHM, and stated that Alfred G.

Kuettner has conferred with King and plans to write either a series

of three articles about king or one article in three parts.

(1)

Martin Luther King, Jr.

- Who Is He?

This will be on King's background.

5

(2)

Where Does King Go From Here?

Kuettner speculates as to King's interest in speaking

and writing in that in recent speeches King indicates he

is moving into international affairs and fancies himself

as some sort of an authority.

(3) King's Associates.

Kuettner has requested assistance concerning King's associates

and desires public source material to use as well as any other informa-

tion we can give him on a confidential basis which would serve to

orient him. The latter information will agt be used by him in his

article.

1ip-14.411:-1403

Ponder recommends that the

Bureau assist Kuettner. He stated

that Kuettner has been ai SAC Contact of the Atlanta Office since

March, 1960, and that Ponder is absolutely certain that kuettner will

not violate our confidence; that Kuettner is completely reliable; and

will write an objective article or articles concerning King.

Ponder

pointed

out that Kuettner is UPI's authority in the South on the Negro

movement and his articles carry a great deal of influence and Ponder

does not believe

that he would prepare anything flattering or favorable

to King.

Ponder further noted that several weeks ago Kuettner prepared

an article on the Selna to Montgomery march which exposed sexual

irregularities on the part of certain of the marchers Bulles contain

no adverse information on Kuettner.

Attached are two documents which it is believed should be

ro Document number 1 contains only public

source information which kuettner could use without, of course, any

Document number 2 is a short summation

There would be no loss of security to our

RECOMMENDATION:

Attached two documents be furnished to Ponder for the use of

Kuettner with the limitations as set forth above.

If approved, this

At 9:30 a.m. on 7/20/66, by referral from the Director's

Office, Bishop in my office received a telephone call from Governor

Kerner, who stated he was in Washington and was leaving this afternoon

to return to Springtield, Illinois. Governor Kerner advised that he has

been informed that recently several Chicago daily newspapers carried

stories to the effect that the Bureau was in possession of information

concerning meetings which Dr. Martin Luther King was holding with young

-"hoodlum" gangs in Chicago.

Governor Kerner was not aware of the identity of the news-

papers or the dates on which these stories were carried in them. He

stated that he would be extremely interested in receiving from the Bureau

any information which we might have along this line, in connection with

the race riots in Chicago, but advised that he is aware that this is

extremely nebulous information. He stated that, on his return to Spring-

field, he would have the particular news articles located and make them

available to SAC Gebhardt, Springfield Office, so that the Bureau would

be aware of what data the papers are alleging the Bureau has in its

possession concerning these meetings of Dr. King.

-It has-been-determined from-the-Domestic Intelligence Division

that Jim-Bevel, the representative of the-Southern-Christian Leadership-

Conference (Martin-Luther-King's-group)-in-Chieago-recently-held-a-meet-

ing with-a Negro-youth"street gang known as the "Blackstone Rangers," at

which time he ran off for them a film of the Watts riot. His alleged

purpose in doing this was to convince them of how horrible the Watts

situation-had.been-and_to.convince them that nonviolence was the best

technique toutilize" in fighting racial discrimination. It is very possible

that Bevel advised the Chicago papers that he had taken this action and

that he was advising the FBI that such action had been taken.

BRIEFING RE MARTIN LUTHER KING

SATURDAY, 8-14-65

AT 2 P.M.

At his request, and with the Director's approval, I briefed.

Speaker John McCormack regarding the background and activities of Martin

Luther King today in the Speaker's rooms.

The briefing lasted approximately 45 minutes. It covered King's

specific acts of immorality as well as his connections with members of the

- Communist Party.

The identity of the members of the Communist Party who

have had control over and association with King were brought out. The latest

incident in which King has advised the press that he will write a letter to

General Ho Chih Minh of the North Vietnamese, in an attempt to establish

himself as a "peacemaker" was related to Speaker McCormack. The communists'

efforts back of this incident, and those individuals perpetrating the incident were

mentioned.

Speaker McCormack was quite calm about the entire briefing. He

stated he had heard much in the way of rumor previously; however, he wanted

to know if the information he had received was accurate. He stated he now

recognized the gravity of the situation and that something obviously must be done

about it. He inquired as to whether the President knew these facts. I replied in,

the affirmative.

The Speaker stated that he thought that "Edgar Hoover did not

call King a notorious liar for nothing." He stated he now recognized why the

Director branded King as he did. He added that he was in complete sympathy

with the Director taking this action.

with it.

The Speaker spoke lengthily concerning the desperate need to

educate Negroes today with the fact that they cannot defy the law and get away

PURPOSE: To obtain approval to alert friendly members of the

news media field of the meeting between Martin Luther King, Jr.,

President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and

James Hoffa, President, International Brotherhood of Teamsters,

Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union.

BACKGROUND: You were previously advised that according to

IX 5456-SE, on 10/17/66 Clarence Jones, a former member of

the Labor Youth League, a communist-front organization, and

now a principal adviser to King, was attempting to arrange

a meeting between King and Hoffa. Jones informed Hoffa's

attorney that king thought Hotta's union might want to

support the civil rights movement to a greater degree because

of its 450,000 Negro members. Jones advised that King is

very sensitive regarding this meeting and does not want any

publicity concerning it.

On October 30, 1966, this same source advised that

• Hoffa had agreed to meet with

King in Hoffa's office in

Vashington,

November, 1966.

was to advise Hoffa's aide what date was agreeable with

King by 10/30/66.

Since King was unable

to meet on any of the above dates, tentative plans were made

to hold the meeting on the ninth or tenth of November, 1956.

it these days are not satisiactory, an alternate meeting

date was scheduled for one day during the week of

November 14, 1966.

Re:

100-106670

OBSERVATIONS: From the above, it is apparent that king is

In dire need of funds.

Secondly, he dislikes going to

Hoffa

because of Hoffa's unsavory reputation.

King

undoubtedly feels that this association might reflect

untavorably upon nis public image. Un the other nana,

It would appear hofia might be concerned with the white

backlash within his own union ranks should it become

known that union funds may be expended to promote Negro

objectives.

It is therefore felt that both men have

just reason for keeping this meeting secret.

Any

publicity concerning it would probably be extremely

embarrassing to both parties.

It would appear that the meeting may be virtually

spontaneous and time in this instance could be very critical.

RECOMMENDATION: A Bureau official be designated now to

alert friendly news media of the meeting once the meeting

date is learned so that arrangements can be made for

appropriate press coverage of the planned meeting to

expose and disrupt it.

ADDENDUM: DOMESTIC INTELLIGINCE DIVISION, 11/3/66, FJB:deh

Special Agent in Charge Donald E. Roney of the

New York Office called at 3 p.m., this date. He said that

through a reliable source they had learned

that Clarence

Jones had

contacted King today. He told King that

arrangements have been made for King to meet with Hoffa in

Hoffa's office in Washington, D.C., for a luncheon meeting

on November 9, 1966. King agreed and they then discussed

the possibility of having

Stanley Levison, a long-time

communist and now a principal adviser to King, attend the

meeting.

They thought this was a good idea and would try

to work it out.

Dr. Espy mentioned to me the column by Joseph Alsop soze

DI. ESPy

expressed grave concern about this and asked me if I could confidentiall

I took the liberty of advising Di. Espy contidentiaily

of the fact that Di. Martin Luther King not only lett a great deal to

be desired from the standpoint of conmunism, but also from the

standpoint of personal conduct.

Also, I referred Dr. Espy to public

source material on Dr. King relative to communisn.

DI. Espy expressed deep gratitude to the Bureau for my

talking to him about this matter,

and assured me he would keep it

strictly to himself and be guided by it in his decisions.

that the National Council of the Churches of Christ would certaizly tot

9/14/65 for an appointment. I was advised by his assistants, Harry Dent and Fred

Buzhardt, that the Senator had called over from the Floor to indicate he must

attend a Republican Party policy meeting which former Vice President Nixon

would supervise. The assistants indicated that they would appreciate talking to

me and that the Senator and I could get together at another time.

Serator Thurmond had put out over the weekend criticizing Martin Luther King for

injecting himself into matters of foreign policy at the United Nations. These

releases also criticized Ambassador Goldberg for giving King an audience,

that King had abnormal sexual habits. He stated it was also widely understood

Dent asked me if there was a concerted effort on the partof the

He then replied that he felt someone, particularly a Senator, should expose King.

I told him this of course was the prerogative of any of the Senators, however, =

they should do their homework well. Dent mentioned that he felt that King had

gone too far in attempting to inject himself into matters of foreign policy. He

stated he felt there would be a wide reaction on the part of the American public.

Dent asked if I could give, him any advice as to what course of action

Senator Thurmond should follow in the future regarding statements concerning

King and civil rights leaders in general. I told him that the Senator, being a

statements he might make, however, this was all the more reason why the Senator

should be very careful about doing his homework.

Re: Senator Strom Thurmond

Dent told me Senator Thurmond had widely used the Director's

testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee, particularly concerning the e

establishment of Soviet Consulates in the United States. At this point, I told

Dent that while the Director definitely maintained his original position, it should

be carefully understood that the Director had not injected himself into matters

of legislation. I told him that the Director's remarks were made on March 4,

1965, prior to consideration being given to ratification of the agreement

Mr. Jack N. Rogers, Attorney at Law, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, ‹

of Louisiana, who was introduced to me through Lee Pennington some montas

ago, has again come to Washington.

He has been in touch with Jay-Sourwine, Chief Counsel of the

Internal Security-Subcommittee, Judiciary.

"He inquired whether the Bureau could assist the Governor of the

State and his office in making a check of their vifices to determine whethcr

they are secure insofar as listening devices are concerned. I advised him:

that in view of our other commitments we, of course, could not make any

security checks of the Governor's office or his office; that we frequently get

such requests from various highly placed individuals and we have had to turn.

might want to call upon some local-help-in-the State.of Louisiana. He indicated

Mr. Rogers understands that the Bureau cannot render any assistance

In-addition to the above, it should be noted that he had no basis for

suspecting that anyone had any listening device in the various offices but he

felt they ought to be checked in order to assure security.

Mr. Rogers also said that although he was opposed to the policy of

the present Attorney General,

he was wholeheartedly in support of the FBI

Appointment with

Senator Robert C. Byrd (D.-W.Va.)

1/19/68

At his request I met with Senator Byrd in his office at

11 a.m. today.

Also present was Mr. Barksdale, Senator Byrd's staff "

member

on research and speech writing.

Senator Byrd outlined to me his responsibilities in the

supervision ci the District of Columbia Government.

He told me he was

-ademely concerned over the pronouncements made

recently by Martin

Luther King thai massive civii disovedience would be staged in tho

nation's capital this summer.

The Senator indicated it was time that

King "met his Waterloo" and that he felt this summer would do the

trick.

He stated this, of course, depended upon whether or not the

President would allow sufficient

force to "knock King down."

Senator Byrd asked me if the FBI could prepare a speech

for him on the subject of King which he could give on the Senate

floor next week.

He stated thereafter he would like to be kept up

to date on the activities of King so that further speeches could be

made. He reminded me that he was a great supporter of Mr. Hoover and

the FBI.

He reiterated his responsibilities in connection with the

D.C. Government and told me that, while other senators and congressmen

were aiding and abetting the alleged civil rights cause, he had con-

stantly sounded forth a warning as to the attachments to subversive

causes which many so-called civil rights leaders had.

233

I told Senator Byrd and

Barksdale that, while we appre-

ciated his great interest, the pressure of work

being of assistance and we, therefore, could no bony reent us from

prepare the speech

he had in mind. •I stated if any items of a public source nature came

to our attention which we felt would be of interest to the Senator, we

could, of course, refer him to the appropriate source which contained

these

items.

Jack

Anderson called and stated he wanted to speak

in confidence.

I told him if it concerned an official

matter I could not agree with this stipulation. He stated

he merely wanted to tip me off that Drew Pearson will have

an article on Friday, 5/24/68, alleging that former AG Bobby

Kennedy ordered the FBI to place a wire tap on Martin Luther

King. He stated the article would probably hurt Kennedy a

great deal.

I told Anderson we would have no comment concerning

such an article; however, that I felt he was doing us a

great disservice inasmuch as the article would certainly

dry up Negro sources of information who have been friendly,

to. the FBI.

Anderson stated he and Pearson were well aware

of

this tact; however, they felt that kennedy should receive a

death blow prior to the Oregon primary.

I told him that, as

he had been advised once before, the FBI would not become

• involved in bitter political struggles and that the record

should be quite clear concerning this fact.

Anderson said

he well understood our position, and that he hoped Pearson's

column would not affect the FBI

too much. I told him that

remained to be seen:

RECORD

concerning King's communist affiliations and sex life as of

February or March 28, 1968. I told him I would make no comment.

He stated he knew such a report was in existence and as a

matter of fact he had read such a report. I asked for the

identity of his source.

I asked him point-blank if Weisl had allowed him

He stated he had already admitted to

me on one occasion that Weisi was his source in the Depart-

ment, but that he must refuse to reveal the identity of the

source who had allowed him to read an

FBI report.

The con-

versation ended with this statement.

We did disseminate an FBI report on King dated 3/12/68.

It may be that Anderson is bluffing or it may be that he is

talking about this specific report. It would be my thought

that he possibly knows the date of the report, but has not

been given

a chance to'read it. We nevertheless should

Upon seeing Jenkins, 'he was joined by Billy Moyers,

another close aide to the President.

Jenkins and Moyers told me

Miss Gandy

that Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall had called Moyers af

approximately 6:15 p.m. that evening and indicated that the Attorney

General had thought it highly advisable for the President to see the Department

of Justice file on Martin Luther King. Marshall stated he wanted to send it right over

by special messenger. Moyers asked Marshall what the hurry was. Marshall replied

that he and the Attorney General wanted to make certain that the President knew all

/ about King.

Fifteen minutes after Marshall's call, he called Moyers again. At this

time, he told Moyers that he wanted to give the White House a little warning. He stated

that he personally knew that the FBI had leaked information concerning Martin Luther.

King to a newspaper reporter.

Marshall told Moyers that he thought the White House

should know this inasmuch as information concerning King would undoubtedly be coming

lout before the public in the near future. At that time the messenger walked in Moyers'

joffice with the Department of Justice file, which proved to be quite bulky.

When I talked to Jenkins and Moyers, they showed me the Department

file on King. It was completely stripped of all administrative memoranda with the

(exceptioniof one receipt from Marshall which indicated he had given Senator Mike

|¡Monroney (D-Okla.) a report on Martin Luther King. The file contained only FBI

(reports which we had previously forwarded to the Department of Justice. There were

no inter-office memoranda in the file. These obviously had been very carefully *

¡removed.

Jenkins stated that obviously there was a "gimmick" in this matter.

He strongly believed that Marshall would not have sent the file over on such an

expedite basis, neither would this matter have come up so suddenly unless the Attorney

General and Marshall had some specific ax to grind. Jenkins personally believed that

the Attorney General had suddenly conceived the idea that he had to be on record with

I the President concerning King's communistic background. Jenkins, of course, is well

the Attorney General was particularly vulnerable because of defenses he had made before

a committee of the Senate in behalf of King. Jenkins believes that the Attorney General,

President with the fact that although he has, for political purposes, defended King, he

wants tre President to realize that he, the Attomey General, is well aware of King's

Moyers stated that he- thought Jenkins' opinion was good; however, he

[Director; however, he would like to talk to me about the matter.

I told Chairman Willis in complete confidence that the Director had

made anumber of off-the-record remarks in answer to questions posed by the Rooney

Subcommittee; however, this, of course, was privileged information and we are not

at liberty to discuss the matter. I told him that he had in his own files considerable

information concerning Hunter Pitts O'Dell and his relationship with Martin Luther King.

and he might desire to do a little research in this regard. He stated he would do this;

however, he wondered about the remarks concerning King's being a sex degeverute

I told him that King was certainly no lily of the valley; however, I felt that we could

Imake no comment at this particular time.

Chairman Willis asked me about the timing of exposing King. He stated

that it would undoubtedly hurt the Democratic Party to do so before the political

conventions this summer. I told him he was in a far better position to judge this

matter than I was. He then ventured the opinion that it would be better to wait until

after the Presidential campaign before doing anything on King.

Chairman Willis called me back twice between 7 and 8:30 p.m. on the

night of 3-12-64. I was out at the time but returned his call at 9 p.m. He was not

home. He called me at 8:40 f. m. the next morning, 3-13-64. At that time, he asked

if I would see Judge Smith at either 11 a.m. or 3 p.m., 3-13-64. I told him I would

be glad to; however, there was little that could be said

that Judge Smith was one of the most powerful men on the Hill and added that it would

do him (Willis) a great deal of good if I could just see Judge Smith for a few moments

and discuss the King matter. I told him I would be glad to do this.

Calvin Haley, Judge Smith's Administrative Assistant, called at 10:30

a.m., 3-13-64 and asked me to see Judge Smith at 3:15 p.m. that afternoon.

Upon seeing Judge Smith, he told me that he was seriously disturbed

/ jabout the fact that there appeared to be considerable derogatory information about King

and apparently no one in the Congress was taking steps to advise the general public

(of this matter. He stated he thought this should be done. He added that he was not

trying to grind an ax in behalf of a move to stop civil rights legislation but to the

contrary felt that it was morally wrong for this alleged spiritual leader of 10, 000

influence over the Negroes in America.

Judge Smith told me that he had heard of the Director's remarks before

the Rooney Subcommittee and that as we well knew, remarks made off the record are

not very well held on Capitol Hill. I told Judge Smith that the remarks made by the

Director had been privileged and that we, of course, were not at liberty to dicusss

them with anyone else. I told him of the documented information concerning King in

House Committee files and that I had suggested to Chairman Willis that he might like

to dig this information up. I told Judge Smith also that despite our desire to see this

scoundrel exposed, it would be out of the question for us to furnish him information and

then his expecting us to back it up later on. I told Judge Smith that this would disrupt

certain operations which appeared to be more important than an exposure of King

from a communistic standpoint.

Judge Smith asked if he could receive information concerning King's

being a sexual degenerate. I told him that the time might come in the near future when

the Director would want me to furnish him certain information on a strictly confidential

basis; however, at this time, I felt sure he could understand that substantial evidence

was needed before anyone spoke out in this regard. Judge Smith stated that he would

be glad to make a speech on the Floor of the House at any time concerning King's

immora' background. He pointed out that this would offer immunity to him and to

This morning Mr. Ralph McGill, publisher of the "Atlanta

dropped by the office to discuss with me Martin Luther King, Jr.

Bureau approval, 1 had previously given McGill some of the basic facts

concerning King's connections with communism and his immoral behavior.

McGill told me that on being advised of the facts concerning King,

he has remained completely silent, As a result, he is being questioned

by associates in Atlanta, Georgia, as to why he is not speaking out in

favor of King and why he is not taking an active part in the banquet

to be given King next Wednesday night.

McGill said that he would never

disclose a confidence and. therefore,

his only reply is that he no

longer is an admirer of Martin Luther King®

Further, he has talked

with some other men who have told him of their knowledge of King's

immorality and their concern about its

and Harry YAshmore of the Arkansas Gazette." He told he the ache,

Stevenson advised him without being questioned about King that he is

aware of King's immoral activities.

Stevenson told McGill that he

considers King to be a

"very dangerous man" to the civil rights movement

and that something should be done about it. Ralph Bunche told McGill

that he has never been an admirer of King's although he thinks King

has done some good things; that a few months ago he began hearing very

disturbing stories about King's immoral behavior. Bunche believes that

King should be maneuvered out of the civil rights field or else he

will do it serious damage.

he had heard some time ago about King's incredibly immoral activities.

Ashmore is very disturbed over it and wishes something could be done

"but he has no specific course to recommena.

Mr. McGill told me that following my first discussion with him

a few weeks ago he contacted a banker friend in Atlanta who was helping

to finance the banquet to be given King next Wednesday night.

The

banker was disturbed and said he would contact some other bankers also

MCGill'S

friend and some of the bankers did take steps to withdraw but this

was

very quickly relayed to bankers in Haiti who were on the threshold

of an important financial deal with the Atlanta, Georgia, bankers.

They took the position that if the Atlanta bankers did not support the

Martin Luther King party, their financial deal with these Georgia

bankers was off.

As McGill said to me, the almighty dollar is still

extremely important and especially so with bankers, and as a result they

got cold feet and decided to go ahead with financing King's party.

McGil] told me that Archbishop Hallinan, Catholic leader in

Georgia, an Episcopal clergyman and a Jewish rabbi are also quite active

in support of this party for king.

He said that he is certain that not

one of these three is aware of King's immoral behavior. I told him

that in view of what stevenson, Bunche,

might want to explore very confidentially and discreetly the subject

matter with these three men. He said he would do this.

McGiii tola me that it ininbs it 15 too lute now, especially in

view of the financial interest of the Georgia bankers in the Haiti deal,

to prevent the banquet from taking place.

However, McGill said he

would do what he could to encourage key people to limit their praise

and support of King as much as possible.

McGill also told me that he is taking steps through RalphBunche

to get key Negro leaders to unite in opposition to King and to gradually

force him out of the civil rights movement if at all possible.

Mr. McGill said that he would like to have President Johnson know

three things- (1) that from diverse sources he has learned of the

incredibly immoral benavior of dr. Martin Luther King, exe, and his

deceiving of sincere, good people in this Nation who have been supportin:

King;@ that he regrets greatly that the banquet is being given in King's

honor next week in Atlanta but that it has gone so far that it is

probably not possible to head it off; and (3) that he believes that the

very best thing that could happen would be to have king step completely

out of the civil rights movement and public life for he feels that if

this is not done, sooner or later King will be publicly exposed and

will do irreparable harm to the civil rights movement in which he,

McGill and others are so interested and have worked so hard for, and

likewise, it will do injury to different citizens of the country who

have been

supporting King not knowing that he is of such low moral

character.

Re: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Mr. McGill said that if he had had time to

see President

Johnson before leaving Washington, he would have told him these

three things, but that he wanted the Director to know that he is

free to quote him on these three points to the President and free

to put all three things in any communication that goes to the

White House from the Bureau.

It is very refreshing to meet a man of McGill's stature in

the field of journalism who is so sincere and honest and desirous.

ot doing the right thing. he is a very admirable man.

Repeatealy,

Mr. McGill told me that he will continue to stay with this problem

to think about it, hoping that he will devise some plan or

course of action that will help to take King out of public life.

McGill told me in a visibly disturbed manner that this problem

centering around King has caused him to wake up at night from time

to time and he is very upset over it. McGill explained that while

he has never been close to King or

• an active supporter thereor, he

nas been compieiely iueniified and very active in furchering civii

rights and better conditions for the Negroes. He thinks that King's

behavior now known to him when publicly exposed will do irreparable

damage to such social causes that he and others have been

throughout a lifetime.

RECOMMENDATION:

Enclosed will be found a letter to the White House setting

forth McGill's discussion for approval and forwarding. Inasmuch as

In memorandum from G. C. Moore to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

dated 6/21/69, it was recommended and approved by the Director

that Bishop personally contact Congressman H. R. Gross (R. - Iowa),

with whom we have had cordial relations, with reference to his

letter of June 19, 1969, and advise him that due to various ramifications

involved in the King telephone surveillance, it is not possible to

furnish him any additional data.

With the Director's approval, Bishop contacted

5-1

Congressman Gross on the afternoon of 6/23/69. Congressman Gross

was very cordial and, when Bishop advised him that it would not be

possible to furnish him any additional data concerning the wiretap

on Dr. Martin Luther King other than what has appeared in the press,

he stated that he completely understood. Congressman Gross stated

that his letter to the Director of June 19, 1969, was motivated solely

by the desire to furnish the Director a Congressional forum if the

Director wished to utilize the services of Corressman Cross in

making public additional facts concerning the approval of the wiretap

on Dr. Martin Luther King and & facts concerning the communist

associations and influence over Dr. King.

Congressman Gross requested that Mr. Hoover send him

a brief acknowledgment of his letter of June 19, 1969, advising that

it is not possible to furnish him any additional data, so that Congressman

Gross may retain it in his files for record purposes in the event any

inquiries should be made of him on this matter..

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached letter be sent to Congressman Gross.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

I have become increasingly concerned in the past few days, as

certain you have, over certain attacks on both yourself and the

Federal Bureau of Investigation over 'the matter of the wiretap' sur-

veillance involving the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

As you know, it is now a matter of public record that summaries of

certain conversations between this individual and one of the most

influential members of the Communist Party, U.S.A., were provided

by you some time ago to members of a House Appropriations Subcom-

mittee.

Further, it has been reported in the press that this communist party

member was one of Dr. King's speech writers and chief advisors.

In addition, it is now known that the late Attorney General Robert

F. Kennedy personally authorized this wiretap surveillance and that.

his successor,

former Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach has

also stated that he officially knew of the surveillance.

this nation and would most definitely be in the national interest!

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to Mr. DeLoach's memorandum of 2-5-64

in which he reported a conversation he had had with Ed Cuthman of

the Department concerning letters to members of Congress dealing

with Martin Luther King.

In this connection the Director has

inquired as to my activities with regard to clearance of such

communications.

The only letter which I had anything to do with clear

ing was one from the Attorney General to jenator Richard B.

Russell dated 11-1-63.

The circumstances surrounding this are

as FolloWs:

Shortly

after noon on 11-1-63 Assistant

Attorney

General (AAG) Marshall furnished to me the Department's tile of

correspondence with Senator Russell concerning the association

King with Hunter Pitts O'Dell.

A proposed letter to Senator

Russell for the Attorney General's (áG) signature dated 11-1-53

was attached.

Marshall said

he and the AG had discussed the

proposed letter with the President.

Marshall asked us

to con-

sider the language in

the proposed

letter to Senator Russell to

determine

if it would jeopardize our informant or otherwise

interfere with our investigation of communist matters.

Since time was of the essence I took the proposed letter

to Mr. Belmont's office and discussed it with him. We concluded

that there were definite objections to the lettes as it was written

as it specifically referred to sensitive sources available to

FBI.

Memorandum to Nir. Belmont

RE: DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING,

see the AG about it.

We did this. After the AG read the letter

as changed he said

he was not certain it would accomplish its

purpose. He called the President and told him what had happened.

Marshall and the AG tried to redraft a letter which would be in

the a to sent

line with our observations.

Each draft after written was dis-

cussed with the President telephonically by the AG and none of

the draits were satisfactory to the President. He thereafter

decided that an innocuous letter saying nothing of substance

should be sent to Senator Russell which letter should be delivered

by AAG Warshall and me. At the time the letter was delivered

the Senator was to be furnished orally by Marshall with detailed

information as to Martin Luther King's activities: I was merely

to assure the Senator as to the sensitive position of our informant

and the fact that information from this informant of a continuing

nature was vital to the country's welfare. After the AG had left

the city Deputy AG Katzenbach was substituted for Burke Marshall

as hatreuvach knew the senator.

an appointment to see the

Senator was made for 5:00 p.mo,

11-1-63. At this meeting Katzenbach

furnisied

the Senator with informatiop concerning King and his

communist connections. It was unnecessary for me to say anything

at this conference other than to confirm Katzenbach's statement

about the sensitiveness of our source.

The Senator indicated

satisfaction with the explanation given to him by Katzenbach and

said that he did not intend to make any speech on the floor of the

"Senate about this.

On my return to the Bureau that afternoon I prepared a

memorandun on this contact which is attached.

The Atlanta Division has received information indicating Mi. Trotter

that a reporter by the name of Cleghorn who writes for the Atlanta

Journal and also is a free-lancer for the Saturday Evening Post,

Miss Holmes

is doing an article for the Saturday Evening Post on Dr. Martin

Miss Gandy

Luther King. A memorandum, from Mr. Sullivan to Mr. Belmont

dater February 4, 1964, reflected this fact inasmuch as the Atlanta

indire

Divisros had written in to tip off the Bureau that Cleghorn might be in contact with

FBI Headquarters. Cleghorn apparently has information concerning King's

scid to not only with Hunter Pit" Dell but additionally with Stanley torines

Guthman came over to see me February 4, 1964,

at 4 PM.

¡ He stated

war to had been tipped off by Schanke (phonetic) of the Saturday Evening Post

thar ghorn was preparing an article on Dr. Martin Luther King and that the article

won, topose king's connections with the Communist Party. Guthman stater he was

plie cicerned inasmuch as it appeared there had been a leak from the FBI in

consction with this matter. He told me that the Attorney General had been most

honcial that there would be no "leaks" concerning King. Guthman quickly added that he-

ord to Attorney General, of course, knew that King was no good and that King

actuary did have communistic connections as well as the fact that King was morally

Jad.

It. a very apologetic tone of voice, Guthman added that the Attorney General's

record concerning King was perfectly clean and that no exposure of King could have

:113y reaction whatsoever against the Attorney General.

I told Guthman he had raised several points that should be straightened

Informal Memo to Mr. Mohr

Re: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Guthman told me he had no proof whatsoever that the FBI had furnished

intormation to the newspapers concerning King. He stated that obyiously the

Department had not leaked any information inasmuch asfonly four individuals in

the Department, the Attorney General, Katzenbach, Assistant Attorney General Miller

and Guthman, were the only ones who knew of King's connections with Stanley

Levinson. I told Guthman that Burke Marshall undoubtedly knew of such connections

inasmuch as I believe he had talked to King. Guthman admitted this was true.

From the tone of Guthman's entire remarks, it would appear he had

two thoughtsin mind without actually stating such thoughts.

These thoughts were

(1) that the Attorney General is most anxious that information concerning King not

be released; and (2) that the Attorney General's connections with King, and his

defensive statements concerning King to the Congress in Civil Rights hearings,

could certainiy injure the Attorney General's political chances for the future.

I made it a point to tell Guthman before he left that the Department was,

f|of course, very close to the Saturday Evening Post, particularly in view of the

deliberate ie: "s Of iniormation to the saturday evening fost on the Cassini anc

Valachi matters. I told Guth man that if the Saturday Evening Post had sbtaine

information coucerning King, it would appear that they might have received such

information irom the same sources where they had gotten their previous facts.

Guthman reacied to this quite anxiously and stated all this may be true, however,

under no circumstances would they give any publication the facts concerning King.

In a very hurt icne of voice, he told me once again the Attorney General was not worried

about what an exposure of King could do to him., He stated he and the Attorney General

are only trying to protect FBI sources of information. A

Following my conversation with the Director at approximately 10 AM

this morning, alter the Director had talked with the Attorney General, I called Guthman

and told him he apparently had misquoted my conversation with him of last night.

I asked Guthman if he had told the Attorney General, in quoting me, that I. had been

"quite concerned about a letter the Attorney General had written in which he defended

(Martin Luther King. " I told Guthman I had not mentioned any letter in my conversation

with him. Guthman replied that the Attorney General had gotten all mixed up in his

conversation with the Director. Guthman admitted I made no reference to any letter.

He also admitted I had not indicated that I was "quite concerned" in referring to the

Attorney General. Guthman explained the basis of the Attorney General's call to the

Director by stating that he and Burke Marshall had gone over to see the Attorney General

and while in his office had mentioned the information which apparently has been

accumulated by the Atlanta, Georgia, reporter. In explaining to the Attorney General.

Guthman stated he told the Attorney

General he had discussed this matter with me

last night and that from the tone of my remarks, Guth man understood that (1) any

exposure of King might possibly jeopardize FBI sources; and (2) any exposure of King

might react publicly against the Attorney General inasmuch as the Attorney General

had defended King before the Congress. I told Guthman my remarks to him had

not meant to imply any potential embarrassment whatsoever to the Attorney General

and that I had brought the Attorney General's name into the conversation only because

of the many newspaper articles which had been written quoting the Attorney General

and his defense of King. Guthman stated that the Attorney General was very fond

00 me, and that he elate tormey neal, though they would so nate around mach

the Attorney General did not under any circumstances believe that my remarks had

implied possible potential embarrassment but the Attorney General had called the

Director merely to keep the record straight.

Guthman referrer! once again to the so-called "letter" the Attorney

General had written concerning King. He admitted once again this matter did not

come up in our conversation last night. He stated there had been a letter, however,

as à result of the Attorney General's appearance before the Magnuson Committee in

Ithe Senate. This occurred at the time of the Attorney General's appearance concerning

Civil Rights legislation.

Senato. Monroney had questioned the Attorney General as

to King's communistic connectious, according to Guthman. The Attorney General

promised to write Senator Monio.iey a letter. Guthman stated that such a letter had

been prepared and had been couched in a very careful language.

He mentioned that

the letter had been cleared by Assistant Director Evans and had then been delivered

to Senator Monroney. He staied that following delivery of this letter, either Katzenbach

or Burke Marshall_along with Air. Evans, had orally briefed Senators Russell and

Monroney regarding King's gommunistic connections.

rate Brando

FACTS FROM BUFILES:

imit taman tria in this matte

Senators Monroney and Magnuson wrote the Director in early July,

1963, inquiring about the current racial agitation and allegations that King and other

civil rights leaders had subversive affiliations. The letter from Senator Monroney

was referred to the Attorney General on July 17, 1963, with the Senator being so

advised on the same date. In the communication to the Attorney General, a summary

of the communist association of King was set forth, including the influence which

Stanley Levinson, Communist Party member, had with King and Levinson's alleged

statement that "King is a whole-hearted Marxist..." On July 18, 1963, the letter

from Senator Magnuson was referred to the Attorney General along with a similar

letter from Congressman Jeffrey Cohelan.

No record was located in Bureau files to indicate that the Attorney

General or anyone in the Department contacted us regarding what information should

be supplied to the Senators and Congressman relative to King. Mr. Evans has declared

that he most certainly did not clear any letter written to the Senators or the

Congressman on this topic.

Informal Memo to Mr. Mohr

Ke: Dr. Martin Luther King, JI.

2/5/64

On July 26, 1963, newspapers throughout the country reported that

Senator Monroney had released the contents of a letter to him from Attorney General

Kennedy stating there is "no evidente" that King or any of the other top leaders of

the civil rights groups is a communist or communist controlled. The letter revealed

the Attorney General based his statement "on all available information from the FBI

and other sources." This letter was dated July 23, 1963. A similar letter

apparently also was sent to Senator Magnuson.

On July 27, 1963, Senator Russell of Georgia wrote the Director

inquiring about much the same matter. This letter also was referred to the Attorney

General under date of July 31, 1963. On November 1, 1963, Assistant Attorney

General Burke Marshall contacted Mr. Belmont's Office relative to the letter from

Senator Russell and a subsequent letter from the Senator to the Attorney General

vigorously complaining about not having received an answer to the earlier

communication. A proposed reply to Senator Russell over the Attorney General's

signature was provided and Mr. Belmont expressed objections to the wording,

particularly since it would jeopardize a most sensitive source. Mr. Evans conferred

with the Attorney General and Mr. Marshall later on 11-1-63 and it was determined

that the draft of the letter to Russell had been approved by the President. The draft

was rephrased three times and each draft was rejectedby the President who finally

instructed that an innocuous communication be sent to the Senator and delivered

personally by Mr. Marshall and Mr. Evans with Mr. Marshall to orally brief the

Senator. Subsequently on 11-1-63, Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach and

Mr. Evans delivered the communication to Senator Russell and Mr. Katzenbach

briefed him about King. Mr. Evans merely verified that a sensitive source was

|| involved.

An interesting parallel to the situation occurred on August 1, 1963,

when the Attorney General gave Mr. Evans a report submitted by our New York Office

on July 22, 1963, on King asking that it be resubmitted to him with a cover memorandur

detailing exact evidence to support a statement contained therein to the effect that

King had been "described as a confirmed Marxist-Leninist as of June, 1963." He told

Mr. Evans that if this report got up to the Hill at this time he would be impeached. He

stated Assistant Attorney General Marshall had reviewed the entire report and stated

" there was nothing new concerning King's alleged communist sympathies and that it

was the timing of the report and its possible misuse which concerned him. The

statement the Attorney General objected to previously had been furnished to main on

several occasions including the letter to him on July 17, 1963, forwarding to her the

letter from Senator Monroney: The Attorney General was advised by memorandom

of August 2, 1963, that "the description of King was made by Stanley Levinsen üret

in 1962 and again in 1963."

Pursuant to Bureau instructions, SAC, Atlanta,

called

Efforts to make

an earlier

appointment with him had been unsuccessful since KING has

been in a travel status during the past two weeks. KING

was advised that the Bureau was concerned

about the above

described invoice since it indicated that the FBI required

that he have a bodyguard.

He was informed that as he knew

the Bureau would not indortake the affording of protoction

to individuals nor would we recommend or require that he

or anyone else have a bodyguard.

KING said he had been unaware that the Adult

Education

Council had submitted this or any other invoice

in connection with his services for expenses for a bodyguard.

He said he had no bodyguard

and required the payment of

expenses for no such person.

He stated he was

very mueh

concerned about the invoice because it requested payment

of the expenses for a bodyguard which he does not have and he

was extremely anxious to clear this matter up and to prevent

the sending of such invoices. KING said he was not aware

that any such expense: money had been requested by the Council

and that all invoices

for his appearances at colleges and

universities are handled by the Council in Chicago and not

by SCLC in Atlanta.

KING was apologetic and expressed appreciation

to the Bureau for calling this misstatement to his attention.

He said he would contact the Council cirectly to make certain

that such invoices are not sent claiming expenses for a non-

existent bodyguard.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: CONGRESSMAN WILLIAM I. DICKINSON

line with the Director's, policy of having new members of Congress contacted where

advisable, Special Hobson H. Adcock of your (Mr. DeLoach) office visited Congress-

man Dickinson On 2-24-65. Dickinson was very cordial, was most appreciative of

the contact, indicated heknew very little about FBI jurisdiction and asked a number

of questions in connection with FBI responsibilities in civil rights. He indicated he

would be most willing to cooperate with the Bureau in matters of mutual interest

and that he was most

grateful for the contact.

OBSERVATIONS:

Martin Luther King, of course, has had his name linked with numerou

coarcist-front groups and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, as well

Es the Saudherz. Conference Education Fund. The Southern Christian Leadership

Conterence (SCLC) is headed by Martin Luther King, Jr. It is currently under

investigation io determine the extent of its communist infiltration, domination and

conidol. The Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF) is the successor

organization to the Southem Conference for Human Welfare, cited in the "Guide iv

Subversive Organizations and Publications" as a communist front by the HUA in

1947. The SCEF is the subject of a current Bureau security investigation.

It is believed, in accordance with existing policy, that it would be

' advisable to inform the Congressman that the confidential nature of FBI files pursua

to regulations of the Department of Justice precludes the Director's responding

favorably to the request of Congressman Dickinson.

RECOLDIENDATION:

It is recommended that th attached letter advising the Congressman

of the confidential nature of FBI files be approved and thereafter porscrudy deliver:

by special messenger.

Mr. Carl Greenburg, Political Editor of the Los Angeles

Angeles Times had just been furnished a statement by Frank Mankiewicz,

Press Secretary to Senator Kennedy. According to Mr. Greenburg,

this statement related to Drew Pearson's claim that Senator Kennedy

authorized FBI bugging or wiretapping of Martin Luther King. Mr..

Greenburg said that he wished the Bureau to have the benefit of this

statement and also would appreciate any comment the Director might

wish to make concerning it.

Mr. Greenburg was advised that the FBI had made no

I comment whatsoever regarding Drew Pearson's article. He did ask,

however, it at all possible the attached statement be brought to Mr.

Hoover's attention personally because as he said he was "more brutal"

in his opinion than anything Kennedy had previously said concerning this

matter.

It is recommended that "no comment" be made concerning

by my office.

since President Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1940, he did, as

the FBI. Since leaving the Department of Justice, Senator Kennedy

has not discussed any particular individual case and he will not do

so now.

"It is unfortunate that Drew Pearson is permitting him-

self to be used in J. Edgar Hoover's continuing campaign against

Martin Luther King --- now apparently against the memory of

Martin Luther King•

"The information that Pearson discusses in his column

from the alleged surveillance was developed, according to him, in

1968, two Attorneys General and one President later and well after

President Johnson's order forbidding such practices."

REPRESENTATIVE WENDELL WYATT

(REPUBLICAN

--OREGON)

MEETING WITH DIRECTOR, 3-25-65

Lin

Per prior arrangements Congressman Wyatt was introduced to

the Director at 10:15 a.M. today by SA Donald R. Morris, Crime Research

Section.

During a very cordial meeting, Congressman Wyatt stated that

ever since his election he had wanted to meet the Director and advise him that

he strongly supports the Director and the FBI and that he would be more than

happy to render to the Bureau any assistance at any time on any matter that the

Director may desire. He advised the Director and the Bureau had been the

target of unjust and unfair criticism, particularly regarding Martin Luther King

and civil rights, and he wanted the Director to be assured of his support.

Wyatt related that he had received between 150 and 200 constituent letters re-

garding the King matter, all of which supported the Director; none supported

King.

!.."

ian: 103

The Director briefed Wyatt on the details leading up to the public

announcement that King was a liar, including the facts on which King was in

error, and reviewed his subsequent meeting with King. Congressman Wyatt

obviously holds no respect for King and his associates and stated he was glad

the Director called King's hand. Mr. Wyatt said he felt King's power stemmed

from the fact that no one in the Administration, except Mr. Hoover, had the

courage to say "no."

Mr. Hoover then summarized portions of his testimony before

the Warren Commission and pointed out the absurdity of some of Chief Justice

Warren's statements relating to the Bureau's not arresting Oswald prior to the

assassination. The Director emphasized the unfair criticism of the Bureau and

the "Monday morning quarterbacking" by the Warren Commission.

M. A. Jones to DeLoach Memorandum

RÉ: Representative Wendell Wyatt

The Director told the Congressman he felt many courts were

taking the handeuffs off the criminal and placing them on law enforcement officers.

Mr. Hoover felt this was due not only to "bleeding heart" theorists but also due

to incompetent and unqualified individuals on the Bench. The Director cited as

an example the case handled by Judge Leighton in Chicago concerning the attack

on police officers by a thug with a broken bottle.

The Congressman mentioned that Oregon had, in November, 1964,

abolished capital punishment. Mr. Hoover reiterated his position on capital

punishment stating he would favor such punishment so long as criminals sentenced

to life in prison could and would be released as early as seven years after sen-

tencing.

He pointed out the fallacy of stating capital punishment did not act as a

deterrent to crime. Wyatt agreed with the Director's position.

Regarding Agent qualifications, the Director stated he had

successfully resisted Robert Kennedy's efforts to have qualifications lowered

merely to accept Negro applicants. Mr. Hoover stated the Bureau has 25 Negro

Agents but all are well-qualified, and he would not lower the standards just to

accept Negroes as long as he is Director.

Congressman Wyatt stated the Oregon State Board of Control

had instituted a research study of 1, 000 check writers to determine if added

legislation or parole and probation changes were necessary. The Board had

requested assistance from the Identification Division to research criminal

records of the 1, 000 individuals in this study and had been advised by letter

that our work load would not permit us to be of assistance. The Director com-

mented that it had been necessary for us to decline similar requests from 18

states as we simply do not have sufficient personnel to research such projects.

and still handle over 20, 000 fingerprint cards each day. The Congressman

stated he understood and appreciated the Bureau's position.

Mr. Wyatt apologized for taking so much of the Director's time

and expressed his appreciation to the Director for the interview. A photograph

was taken, and the Director told Mr. Wyatt his door was always open to him.

MR. TOLSON:

Mr. Irving Davidson called and stated he wanted to

advise you what his friend, Mr. James R. Hotta, thought of

Martin Luther Ring...

Mr. Davidson said Mr. Hoffa had lunch last Thursday with

Martin Luther King and that he, Mr. Davidson, had dinner that night

with Mr. Hoffa. He stated Mr. Hoffa told him he did not respect

Mr. King too much from the way he talked to him; that he felt Mr. King

was like the man who ran a 100 yard dash and ran out of steam at about

40 yards; thai he thought King had veen living ine life vi Guiduerg in

Miami, i.e. living off his people and that he is afraid he is going to

have to go back to earning an honest living; that King wanted to attach

himself to the Teamsters Union and wanted to use the Teamsters as

a platform but Mr.

Hoffa did not want anybody to use the Teamsters

uness they are teamsters; that Hoffa thought King was a faker anc

was losing his strength; that King asked Hoffa what he thought about his,

King's, going to Vietnam and telling the soldiers why they were there;

that Hoffa told him they were there because they were Americans and

did not need him, King, to tell them why they were there; that Hoffa

told King he had better go back and work with his own people and

not set themselves as special citizens of the United States.

Mr. Davidson said he knew Mr. King was very unhappy as he

thought he would come back with a check.

It was previously recommended and approved that Crime

Records alert friendly news media regarding a proposed meeting between

King and Hoffa 11/9/66.

Through a reliable source we learned late last night

that in view of publicity in the New York Daily News regarding this

proposea meeting, xing aud his aides hau decided that it would bo

unwise to meet with Hoffa. It was further ascertained that King was

still due to arrive in Washington at 11:30 AM this morning, it being noted

that he had a speech scheduled at Howard University this evening.

We alerted Julian Morrison, a very friendly reporter with

the Washington News, and Sid Epstein of The Star regarding King's

arrival time in Washington. The reporters cornered King as he came

off the plane and quizzed him about the meeting with Hoffa. King at

first told the reporters that the meeting had been cancelled and he seemed

"to be flustered at the reporters' appearance. He then ducked into a

mens' room at the airport with his aides and upon emerging told

the reporters that there had been discussion regarding his meeting Hoffa

but that he had no further comment at this time, and he had decided to

hola a press conference later on this afternoon at the Statler Hotel.

King then left the airport with Clarence Jones who had come down earlier

from New York, and with an attorney with Jones by the name of Philip

Sipser, who identified himself as a labor lawyer.

Morrison advised at 3:15 PM this afternoon that he had

finally gotten through to King's party at the Statler and had talked to

King's aide Reverend Andrew Young.

Young at this time informed Morrison

that the meeting between King and offa was olf and he alaimed, that the a

meeting had been cancelled last night.

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.

Security Matter - C

Proposed Meeting with James R. Hoffa 11/9/66

Morrison pressed him for details and Young said that the

proposed purpose of this meeting had been "misinterpreted." He said

King had wanted to have an off-the-record discussion with Hoffa regarding

the problems of the Negroes in the Teamsters and Young claimed that

King's outfit had worked closely with the Teamsters in Atlanta and

Chicago and they felt it was time for them to meet the Teamster head.

Young said it was difficult for King to have a private conversation with

anyone in view of his prominence and reiterated that the whole matter

had been "misinterpreted and distorted." Reporter Morrison continued

I to press Young and Young finally acknowledged that King might try to

have a meeting with Hoffa at some other time.

Morrison advises that The News will carry a picture tomorrow

of King arriving in town, together with the information sei oui above.

The Star is also going to report this meeting.

It is felt that our counterintelligence aim to thwart King

in receiving money from the Teamsters has been quite successful to date.

The above is for your information, and certainly highlights

• the excellent results which have been achieved through close cooperation

between the Domestic Intelligence Division and Crime Records. We have

just received a copy of the late edition of today's Star which carries the

story by Ronald Sarro, captioned "King Denies Going to Hoffa for Funds."

PROPOSED MEETING, 11/9/66

Reference is made to the three memoranda from

Mr. Baumgardner to Mr. Sullivan concerning captioned matter dated

10/28/66, 11/3/66 and 11/4/66. It was pointed out that arrangements

had been made for King and Hoffa to meet in Washington at Hoffa's

office, 11/9/66, for lunch to discuss financial aid to King, etc. The

Director approved the alerting of the press prior to the meeting.

There is attached a story from Page 2 of the "New York

Daily News" today, and "The Washington Post" of today, Page 3. These

reflect that King will visit Hoffa here in Washington on Wednesday, 11/9/66.

I took this matter up with Frank Holeman of the "New York Daily News"

on a very confidential basis and also have discussed the matter with Victor

Riesel, who will have a longer story this week in his national column.

News photographers and wire services are also being

alerted to give coverage to the meeting tomorrow.

"Trent, who said he was a spokesman for

about 100 Negroes

at Pitt and an Undergraduate,

noted

that Dr. King's mode of transportation

from the airport to Pitt was insufficient for a

"man of his caliber.'

"'He will be jammed into a Mustang convertible

with all of his aides,' he declared.

"Trent said Negro students were signing a

petition protesting Pitt's treatment of their race.

"'This is not the first time that Negroes

have been trampled upon by Pitt,' he asserted.

'We want to show the university that we are unified

and

protest these actions.'"

John Vrana, Assistant to the

Dean of Student Affairs, advised that John Robert Loch,

Director of Student Union, University of Pittsburgh, makes

the arrangements for speakers in the public affairs

lecture

series and sendsthe official invitations from the University.

He also meets the guests upon their arrival and drives them

in his personal automobile, a

Mustang convertible, to the

University. Vrana said this is normal procedure for guest

speakers in this lecture series

regardless of the importance

of the position of the speaker.

Vrana also stated that the contract with King is

for his visit with one bodyguard.

He said the expenses for

King and his bodyguard will be paid by the Student Union

from money budgeted to the Student Union by the University

of Pittsburgh for this purpose.

Vrana stated that even though standard procedures

are for loch to pick up the guests in his personally-owned

automobile, it is his understanding that the University

plans to make available the University limousine and chauffeur

for the purpose of picking up King and his party.

Vrana stated that it is expected that approximately

600 people will attend the lecture as this is the maximum

capacity of the Student Union Ballroom.

Col

On the morning of April 29, 1966, I introduced Chief Carl Hansson

to the Director. Mr. Hoover thanked Chief Hansson for the assistance he has

rendered to the FBI in lecturing before the National Academy over all the years.

He complimented Chief Hansson for his contributions to the National Academy

whereupon Chief Hansson told the Director he was deeply grateful to him for

letting him participate in the National Academy program and also for what the

Director had done for the Dallas Police Department in renewing training and

cooperation. Chief Hansson stated that he regretted what occurred in Dallas

but he fully agreed with what the Director had to do. He said it should have

never happened. The Director then outlined to Chief Hansson the basic problems.

that we had with former Chief of Police Jesse Curry and the head of the Detective

Bureau of the Dallas Police Department. The Director said that as a result of

the inexcusable actions on the part of these men, he had severed relations with

the Dallas Police Department and afforded them no training assistance and

accepted no National Academy candidates from that department. He described

the situation concerning the Dallas Police Department as being utterly

inexcusable and said that he wanted to have good relations similar to those

that we had with Chiet hansson, particularly in a city as large as Dallas.

He said we should always work together to accomplish our joint goal.

The Director. told Chief Hansson of his meeting with the

Mayor of the City of Dallas Erik Jonsson and how he outlined to the Mayor the

problems we had with the Dallas Police Department. The Director told Jonsson tha

we were unable to work with the Chief of Police. Mayor Jonsson indicated to the

Director that he was going to get rid of Chief Curry. The Director said

that if the Mayor followed through with his promise, he would again fully

cooperate with the Dallas Police Department. Subsequently, Chief Curry

retired and the new man,. Chief Charles Batchelor, was appointed.

The

Director described him as a very high-class man and told Chief Hansson

I that we have removed all restrictions concerning the Dallas Police Department.

The Director also commended Chief Hansson for the attitude

that he had when he was Chief of Police with regard to the handling of civil

rights cases. The Director pointed out how in most police departments

across the country today, we seem to be getting excellent cooperation in

handling these matters and for the most part the only place we are encountering

difficulty is in dealing with some of the so called red-neck sheriffs in the deep

south. The Director told Chief Hansson that Civilian Review Boards destroy

the morale of the police department. Chief Hansson added that he felt a

Chief of Police is abdicating his authority and responsibilities when he

permits a Civilian Review Board to come into effect.

The Director told

him he was absolutely right. The Director told Chief Hansson about the

Civilian Review Boards in Philadelphia and Rochester and that during the

Philadelphia riots, it was found that the police were not making arrests because

they did not want to be called before the Review Boards. The Director said

• that he was surprised that Leary, Commissioner of Police in New York, took

the job in New York when he knew that he would have to have a Civilian Review

Board.

The Director also discussed with Chief Hansson the problem

of verbal brutality which is confronting police across the nation today. He

also discussed defacto segregation which is occurring in New York City. He

pointed out to Chief Hansson how wrong this was. Chief Hansson agreed and

said that we were living in changing times and conditions were different. He

said that morals of the country had changed. The Director agreed. He said

that people were expecting rights to be afforded to them without carrying out

or accepting responsibilities that goes along with these rights. the Virector

told Chief Hansson of his visit with Martin Luther King and how he/was advocating

down in Alabama today that the Negroes go out and vote as a block. The

Director said this was very harmful leadership. It would be just as bad

if the Jewish people recommended that their people go out and vote in a

block and the Catholics recommended that their people votein a block.

He was glad to note, however, that here in the District of Columbia where

there is considerable effort on the part of Negroes to establish home rule

that there is a backwash., The Director then discussed with Chief Hansson

the problems occurring in the District of Columbia particularly in the schools.

Chief Hansson was most grateful to the Director for giving him

a few minutes of his time and again expressed a great admiration for the

Director and told him he looked very well. He expressed his extreme

appreciation for being permitted to lecture before the National Academy.

The Director again thanked Chief Hansson and the interview was terminated.

Chief Hansson was most appreciative of the Director giving

him a few minutes of his time and again commented how fine the Director

looked. He gave an excellent lecture before the National Academy this

morning and this afternoon participated in a panel discussion that I am

sure all members of the class profited from.

SUBJECT:

REFERRAL BY CONGRESSMAN JOHN J. GILLIGAN

OF POST CARD DE PICTING MARTIN LUTHER RING OHIO,

AND OTHERS AT COMMUNIST TRAINING SCHOOL.

By communication dated 4/26/65, captioned congressman, Democrat,

who was elected 11/64 and for whom no derogatory information appears in Bufiles,

forwarded a post card depicting Martin Luther King and others at an alleged commu-

nist training school. Gilligan asked the names of the three people sitting near Dr.

King and that this post card be returned to him. On the reverse side of the post

card the names were set forth and a description as to where they appeared.

This

photograph is readily recognized as one widely being circulated by individuals

attempting to point out the true nature of King's activities. A circular received by

this Bureau frequently as reprinted from the "Augusta Courier" on 7/8/63 shows

the photograph from which the post card picture was cropped. Actually the post

card cropped Abner W. Berry and the description on the reverse side would tend to

indicate that Berry was the person known to the Bureau as Myles Horton, Director

of the Highlander Folk School.

According to Bufiles the individuals depicted in the circular are

properly identified. All of these individuals are well known to the Bureau for their

communist-front activities.and connections.

OBSERVATIONS:

It would be difficult to put in writing the description of the true

photograph from which the post card was cropped; however, a personal contact

could deliver the circular and the congressman: could be apprised of the proper

names to be utilized in connection with his request.

Headquarters,

subject of Martin Luther King.

As I have reported in previous

communism.

Lest night Dr. Ispy told me that he has been working on

this matter whenever the opportunity presented itseli and he said

he wented the FBI ic know thot chope have boon takon by the Nationui

Council to make

certain fron this

time on that Martin Luther King

will never get "one single dollar" of financial support from

the National Council.

Further, Dr. Espy told me that since our

fist conversation he has heard from some othes sources concerning

King's moral depravity.

In view of this, he felt that he was free

to discuss the matter

with a few key Protestant clergynen, including

Dr. Carson Blake, Presbyterian leader who has been active

in the

civil rights movement.

Naturally, said Dr. Espy, they were horri-.'

Lied and Dr. Blake said that he could not see how a Christian

clergyman could give any more support to a man like king.

DI.

Espy also told me this week he intends to confer with Roy Wilkins,

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for the

purpose of persuading Wilkins that the Negro leaders should completely

isolate King and remove him from the role he is now occupying in

civil rights activities. In Dr. Espy's opinion, the most effective

way to dethrone King and get him out of the public eye is to have

the important Negro leaders united in their determination to do this.

NATIONAL DIRECTOR

APPOINTMENT - FBI HEADQUARTERS

5:00 p.m., DECEMBER 1, 1964

At his request, I met with Jim Farmer at approximately 5 p.m.

12-1-64. Farmer flew down from New York for this appointment.

Upon seeing Farmer, I told him I was glad to have the opportunity

to get together with him despite the unfair criticism that he and Reverend King had

launched against the Director and the FBI during the past several days. I told him

I wanted to straighten him out on such criticism. Farmer laughed and replied that

he personally had not been guilty of any serious criticism against the FBI and that

he hoped that I would understand tnat he wanted to continue to be friends rather than

lenemies.

Farmer told me that he had heard from a number of newsmen that the

FBI planned to expose Reverend King as a sexual pervert by tomorrow, Wednesday,

December 2, 1964. He stated that he and King had had a lengthy conference last

night in New York City and that it had been agreed that Farmer should come down to

see me and prevent this action being taken if at all possible. He stated he knew that

King had made a sudden decision to come down also and that he hoped that King's n

meeting with the Director had been an amiable one. I told him that it had been.

I told Farmer that we, of course, had no plan whatsoever to expose

Reverend King. I told him that our files were sacred to us and that it would be

unheard of for the FBI to leak such information to newsmen. I told him I was com-

pletely appalled at the very thought of the FBI engaging in such endeavors. I told

Farmer the FBI had received rumors of this nature from a number of sources and

that we felt that there obviously was some substance to these rumors. I mentioned

to Farmer that undoubtedly King has numerous enemies and that most certainly

someone had apparently done quite a job on King;

RE: JAMES FARMER,. CORE

Farmer told me that he was glad to hear that the FBI did not plan to

expose King.

He stated this had a number of civil rights leaders quite worried

inasmuch as if King were exposed this would possibly ruin the entire civil rights

movement. I again repeated that we had never entertained the idea to expose

Reverend King; however, I wanted Farmer to definitely know that the campaign of

slander and vilification against the Director and the FBI should stop without any

delay. I told him that if this war continued that we, out of necessity, must defend

ourselves. I mentioned that I hoped it would not be necessary for the FBI to adopt

defensive tactics. Farmer got the point without any difficulty whatsoever. He

immediately assured me that there would be no further criticism from him. He

stated he felt certain there would be no further criticism from King.

I told Farmer that one of the chief critics of the FBI, whose facts were

obviously slanted, distorted and false, C. T. Vivian, was a member of the Board of

Directors of King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. I told Farmer that he

should get the word to Vivian also.

Farmer told me that he was greatly relieved to have this conversation.

We talked about a number of other things, a member of the Communist Party in

Chicago who is on CORE's staff in that city.

The Domestic Intelligence Division had previously requested that I

advise Farmer of the identity of this man. Farmer assured me that the man would

be removed immediately and that he would not know the source of information involved

in this matter.

I reiterated to Farmer once again that our door was always open for

discussion but that he should definitely keep in mind that if his group wants war they

could certainly find it fast. He stated that he wanted to part as friends and that he

hoped that we could continue the pleasant relationship that we started over two years

ago in New York City in our various discussions. I assured him that this would be

possible as long as the unfair criticism did cease.

FILM - MARCH FOR FREEDOM"

This morning I saw Jay Howe of our Subcommittee and he advised that

during the Attorney General's appearance before the Subcommittee yesterday morning

no discussion arose involving the Bureau on the part of the members with respect to

the Director's testimony.

pont liter

Bains Baner

Howe did state ,that all of the members are very concerned regarding the

background of Martin Luther King which the Director furnished off the record anc

strictly among themselves to Jay's knowledge have had quite lengthy discussions

concerning it.

Jay Howe stated that yesterday morning after they had concluded hearings

on the Justice Department items, the members and the Chairman instructed him to

have the USIA show them the film which they have and propose to distribute the

captioned "March For Freedom. " Howe stated all members were present for this film.

except Congressmen Lipscomb and Neal Smith. Howe stated the film generally deals

with the racial situation in this country and the members were particularly disturbed

and irked at the fact that Martin Luther King appears to predominate the film. He

appears in better than half of the entire film and after viewing it the members gothe

impression that he had played an advisory role in its preparation.

Howe stated on a strictly confidential basis that the Chairman with

the

concurrence of the other members of the Subcommittee feel that an approach should.

be made to the President so that he can instruct USIA to withdraw this film and not 3+

permit its circulation. The Chairman also suggested to Howe he might want to mention

to the Senate Appropriations Committee Clerk, Harold Merrick, that maybe members

of the Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations would want to view this film but definitely

without giving any of the King back ground which was furnished off the record.

Kylu

Howe stated that yesterday afternoon after viewing the USIA movie members

had also observed the editorial in yesterday's Washington Post dealing with this picture

which in substance indicated it was a good film; however, it would meet with opposition

from certain areas particularly those who were "confused'' or "fainthearted."

Have was most appreciative of the letter Rifleceived from the Director

We know that Reverend Dr. Martin luther king, a sell-avowed

Marxist, represents a very real security problem to this country. In limy

addition to his Marxism, Di. King, as we know, for some time now has

been surreptitiously receiving guidance from concealed members or the

Communist Farty of

the Unitea States.

Apart from the security factor,

he is a disgrace In the Negro people of this country because of his

#4,1

haven- -iciunduct while at the same time purporting to be a minister

as the gospel.

Obviously he has the capacity to deceive people very

successfully.

This was made evident most recently by his heing selecte

1 by

rime" magazine as the Man of the Year.

Further,

we know that he has been able to cleverly deceive

both very important Protestant and Catholic organizations, securing

thereby support from them which gives him added stature.

It should be

very clear to all of us that Martin Luther king muse, at some propitious

point in the ruture, be revealed to the people oi this country and to

his Negro followers as being what he actually is a fraud, demagogue and

moral scoundrel.

When the true facts concerning his activities are

such should be enough, if handled properly, to take him off

Dis eedestal and to reduce him completely in intluence so that he will

no longer be a security problem and no longer will be deceiving and

misleading the Negro people.

When this is done, and it can be and will be done, obviously

much confusion will reign,

particularly among the Negro people.

There

Will

be embarrassment, frustration, confusion, resentment, et cetera.

Bocause of this and the emotional reaction that will set in, it is not

unlikely that movements like the

• Nation of Islam could benefit greatly.

Further, other ridiculous developments similar to the Old Father Divine

and Daddy Grace organizations may appear.

The Negroes will be left without

a national leader of sufficiently compelling personality to steer them

in the proper direction.

This 1s. what could happen, but need

not happen

the right kind of a national Negro leader could at this time be

so asse couploped so as to overshadow De, King and be in the position

nole of the

leadership of the

Negro people when King has beep

completely discredited.

Memorandum for MI. Belmont

RE: SAMUEL RILEY PIERCE, JR.

For some months I have been thinking about this matter. One

day I had an opportunity to explore this from a philosophical and

sociological standpoint with Dr. Frank R. Barnett, whom I have known for

some years.

As I previously reported, Barnett is

a VEry abLe IeLLOW

a Iormer Uxtora scholar and protessor, and one on whom I can rely.

asked Barnett to give the matter some attention and if he knew any

Negro of outstanding intelligence and ability let ne know and we would

have a discussion.

the Negro people a truly brilliant, honorable and loyal Negro who would

I think in a very

sense this necessarily must be of great interest to us. It would

be most helpful to have a man like Pierce leading the Negroes to whom we

could go, if necessary, and rely upon in sensitive matters over which this

Bureau has jurisdiction.

I want to make it clear at once that Id

But 1 do propose that 1 be given permission to explore

further this entire matter With Frank Barnett and any other person known

to both Barnett and myself who could be helpful. If this thing can be

set up properly without the Bureau in any way becoming directly involved,

I, think it would be not only a great help to the FBI but would be a fine

thing for the country at large.. While I am not specifying at this moment,

there are various ways in which the FBI could give this entire matter

After the meeting different individuals came up to me,

and I was quite surprised when they started to tell me what they

knew about Martin Luther King. They seemed to have knowledge of

his connections with communism, etc.

The Alsop article for

example was mentioned by them, wherein Alsop had stated that fi

King was taking counsel from communists and had been advised by

Government officials to stop but had not done so.

They also

were aware that King had been engaging in highly immoral

activities

in hotel rooms and etc.

They were disturbed over this.

As one man said, if this information is publicized and believed

King will turn out to be a real liability to the civil rights

movement.

They mentioned their concern over the increasing

points that have been expressed at the conferences; and

mentioned

•that the Institute was engaged in opposing extremism, and at this

time it seems that lawlessness can be regarded as one form of

this as well as communism, the Ku Klux Klan, etc. They then

mentioned Martin Luther King and his contribution to creating

the spirit of lawlessness that members of the conference had

mentioned to me.

They mentioned King's connections with communism

and his gross immorality.

They referred to Marquis Child's column

in the "Post" where he mentioned that the FBI knew about such

activities.

For record purposes, at 3:20 p.m. this afternoon Wick received

national, and Grant Dillman currently in charge of the Washington office, are

making every effort to discredit Martin Luther King and his recent outburst on

Vietnam. Grant Dillman, said Fogg, has learned that Levison, whom he described

as a New York attorney, is connected with the Communist Party in some way and

advised Martin Luther King to come out against the Administration on Vietnam.

Fogg asked if there is anything of a public source nature that would discredit

Levison cither as a momber of the Communist Party or as a membor of a front

group or signer of a petition concerning communism or the Soviets.

Atter Checking, Wick told Fogg we could be of no help to him.

Grant Dillman at 3:40 p.m. today called Wick. He said United

Press International's main concern is to avoid a libel suit on the part of Levison.

Wick told him we could be of no help to him whatsoever.

Dillman said that under the circumstances, he believed United

Press International would make no mention of the alleged connection they have

picked up between King and Levison. Wick asked him how he knows that Levison

is advising King on the Vietnam matter. Dillman said one of his reporters obtained

this from a friend in Atlanta, presumably at Southern Christian Leadership

Conference Headquarters.

The Baptist World Alliance is a worldwide

organization of Baptists which meets every 5th year. In connection

with the 11th meeting of this group which was held at Miami, Florida, last

month, you will recall that we received information several months ago

that the committee in charge of selecting speakers was giving some

consideration to inviting King to address the conference.

The Director approved

that SA Fulton and I discreetly approach several of the ministers on the

program committee who were known to us personally and brief them

informally on King's background with the distinct understanding that they

were to keep the information strictly confidential This was done and as

a result King was not invited to address this worldwide Baptist meeting.

*It is of interest to note that the July &, 1965, issue of

"Capital Baptist," a publication of the D. C. Baptist Convention contains

an article about the Miami meeting reflecting that King attended as a

delegate.

Reporters met him at the airport and asked him why he had

not been invited to speak at the meeting. King allegedly reported that

he did not think it was necessary for him to speak at every Baptist

Convention. King also reportedly stated,

"I come as a delegate and as

an individual Baptist.

It is not necessary for me to be on the program

to have fellowship with the brethren. "

Attached for your approval for dissemination to

friendly news media sources is a copy of a Negro newspaper

editorial attacking Martin Luther King, JIe, Fresident,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

BACKGROUND:

King's group is in desperate need of funds. In

an effort to combat this problem, King has organized a

variety show starring Harry Belafonte, well-known Negro

vocalist with a subversive background, to tour seven major

cities in the United States. The proceeds will go to the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference. King is touring

with the group and speaks during each performance.

The attached editorial entitled Think Iwice

Before Going to Coliseum Tuesday Night"' appeared in the

"Forward Times," the leading Negro newspaper in Houston,

Texas.

This paper attacks King for his stand on Vietnam

Blesse

and claims his appearance in Houston is "an imposition on

the conmunity." King is also referred to as "a misguided

claims King's position regarding the Vietnam war "borders

OBSERVATIONS: 7

ESSUR

NY-3810as* has advised us that this news item is

extremely irritating to King.

In addition, the advanced

ticket sales were slow in Houston, Texas, prior to the

performance on October 17, 1967. This newspaper story

may have caused many of the citizens of Houston to "think

twice before going" and indeed, not go at all.

It 'Is felt that if this article is given wide-spread

publicity as how thinking Negroes really feel about King,

two objectives can be accomplished. One, publicize King

as a traitor to his country and race. Secondly, reduce

his income from these shows since he has five more

performances to give; namely, Chicago, Illinois, October 19;

Cleveland, Ohio, October 21; Washington, D. C., October 23;

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 26; and Boston,

Massachusetts, October 27.

Several weeks ago FORWARD TIMES

made an editorial expression which

stated; among other things, that Dr. Mar-

tin Luther King had strayed oft onto an

extremely dangerous course which ran

in the opposite direction trom the civil

frights leadership course that vastl

numbers of citizens. had come to know

and respect him for over a wide span of

years.

Now, we wish to make it crystal clear

that this newspaper, of course, respects

and upholds Dr. King's right to take a

position that is, what we think to be,

contrary to good judgement. It he wishes

to be the spokesman tor the 'peaceniks',

that's his business. When, however, Dr.

King joins with others and tries to impose

that poor judgement upon the entire Negro

community which is already beset with,

more in-depth and complicated problems.

than can apparently be coped with, at that,

point we call it our business.

FORWARD TIMES takes the position

that Dr. King's visit to Houston next

Tuesday night is an imposition upon this

community of the first order. We also

think that the fact that he is shrouding

his "remarks" behind a big name popu-

lar singer like Aretha Franklin suggests

subtertuge. It Aretha Franklin, who is

now at the peak of fame, permits this

group of 'peaceniks' to use her name to

further their ettorts, all that we cay say,

is, "that's her business." It she wakes up:

later and finds that she has acted just,

like Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, all that

we can say is that she brought it all upon

-nerselt.

Our concern is not so much with what

course Dr. King and Miss Franklin elect

to follow. hat concerns us is that the in-

NW

55245 DocId: 32989661 Page 306

nocent public, it not properly fore

warned, might be taken in by their visit

to Houston. We think that it what Dr. King

has to say isn't within itseit meritorious

enough to draw a crowd, he shouldn't be

coming to town in the first place to say

it. As it stands now, Aretha Franklin'sf

name has been added to the show and many!

people will pay the fee expecting to hear l

her sing. She will be the 'balt' to help

get the crowd inside the Coliseum. Once

inside, the trapped ticket purchasers will

have to sit quietly while Dr. King spews

about the "immorality" of the war in

Viet Nam. Whether we like it or not, the

United States of America is at war with

a determined aggressor. How we got into

this war matters little at this point. The

bold truth is that we are shooting 'live'

ammunition at them and they are shoot-

ling the same type back at us with re-d

"markable eftectiveness.

Looking at the contlict logically andi

realistically, we cannot escape the fact

that we have absolutely no course open

to us but to disregard all of the babble

of weaklings. We, as bonafide American

citizens, must take a stand with our

country. In our actions, in our conver-

sations and in our preachments, we must

give no aid and no comfort to the enemy.

• We must remember that all wars are

immoral and wher Martin Luther King

preaches about how immoral the Ameri-

can bullets are and fails to ofter us an f

,alternative for stopping those immoral;

bullets being tired at our boys, we have |

got to take the ex-civil rights worker.

go in a town called Cicero and he hasn't

been the same since. We cannot sit by

and allow him to lose thousands of

Negro citizens also just because he can't

find his own way.

Crispus Attucks didn't call the cause

at Boston Commons "Immoral". He

stood up like a man and tell like a proud

isolaier. From that moment on, both black

jand white men have stood up for Ameri-

ca. Negro citizen soldiers have stood

like men and fallen, it need be, on battle

fields in tar away places all over the

world every since Crispus Attuck first

stood up back in the beginning. This na-

tion has grown strong and itis respected

and, yes, even teared, because we have

been blessed by the Almighty Grace ot

God to have strong men at the right place,

jat the needed time who didn't mind stand-!

ag up tor right, tor God and for Country.

It then is not reasonable that we now*

should settle for anything less than what

the most courageous have done.

As we see it, Dr. Martin Luther King

is suggesting that we Negroes take some-.

thing lesser than the courageous route:

It he follows the same pattern that he has

tollowed in his other "remarks" made

in other cities, he will dwell upon Negro

problems just long enough to get the at-

•tention of the listeners and then he will

suddenly shift to the hard-sell of taking:

the lesser route in the war that this!

country is now engaged in.

FORWARD TIMES firmly believes that i

in the long run we will lose any and all

respect that the total community might

now hold for us. Our job is to try, and

•build more respect and not tear down-

the little we already have.

-**

" man whö will not tight for his

country hasn't got any civil rights or

any respect due him. For Dr. Martin

Luther King to try and cloud our peo-

ple's minds, in regards to helping our

country in its hour of need, borders

"upon treason.

There is no soft middle when one'

country is at war or in trouble that will

allow room for ambitious men to play.

"tootsy" with wild hairbrained schemes.

Either you fight or you run. Either you

support your fighting men or you sabo-

tage them with preachments that sound

good, give hope and give courage only

to the enemy.

Even though Negro citizens have had

ditterences 'at home' they have always

stood firmly shoulder to shoulder with

the remainder of America when the going

igot rough. FORWARD TIMES believes

that this will continue despite peopl

like Martin. Luther King and company:

It puzzles us how Harry Belafontt

was selected to headline a show that was

supposed to be aimed in the Negro inter-

est. We cannot help but wonder how much

real concern he has for the suttering ot

Negro womanhood. As we recall, once he

got famous, he quit his Negro wite and

married a white woman. We don't have

anything against marrying white women,

but when you do, don't come into Hous-

ton and try to charge hardworking Ne-

gro women $1.50 admittance fee under

the pretext that they are going to hear

one thing and something else is up your

Isteeve.

Of course, Houston citizens are free

_..to.do.anything.that thy.ch pse ar:.t

attending this show. All that we ask is

that you THINK TWICE BEFOF EGOING.

FBI'S REPORT ON KING READY"

by Robert S. Allen and Paul/Scott

'The above-captioned syndicated column appeared in the Northern

Virginia Sun, Arlington, Virginia, on August 24, 1967, is datelined

Washington, D. C. and states that "powerful leaders in Congress are rolling

up their big guns for their coming confrontation with Dr. Martin Luther King."

It then states, 'Their Big Bertha - the contents of the FBI's file on King - has

been examined and readied for firing by a House Appropriations subcommittee

headed by Representative John J. Rooney, D - N. Y., a strong civil rights

advocate."

DC

Congressman Rooney called me late this afternoon and asked me if

I had read this particular column and I told him that I had. He said he is re-.

ceiving copies from all over the country and he just wanted the Director to

know that he had no intention of holding any hearings on Martin Luther King

and specifically concerning the Director's testimony before his Subcommittee.

I reassured him that the Director was well aware of the fact that he

did not intend such a hearing and if the Director felt that way I would have

been knocking on his door earlier today. He laughed and said he just wanted

the Director to know that he had no such intentions. He did state however,

that-the column was bad for him-politically-in his district where he has so -

many Negro voters.. I told-him it seemed to'me that Allen and Scott had just

RE:

MARTIN LUTHER KING, SIR.

200106670

OBSERVATIONS:

"Because of Olds' close association with Shriver, It would

not appear to be prudent to attempt to deal with him. It appears

ITOI our study that senator Saltonstall 1s the nost logical indi

vidual to deal with and that if he were personally approached by

Assistant Director Deloach and orally briefed, in the strictest of

confidence, concerning king, he would be in a position to take the

necessary action to prevent. King from receiving an honorary degree

fron springtield College.

RECONMENDATION:

iIf approved, Deloach should personally orally brief

senator Saltonstall in accordance with the attached "Top Secret"

sunmary Indicating

King's communist connections and degenerate.

make-up.

"this is the same summary we previously used In the

Marquette University situation) It should be made clear to

Saltonstall that the Information is being giver hin in the strictest

of confidence with the thought that he might desire to use it in

preventing king fron receiving ran honorary degree fron Springfield

college and thus save that institution from embarrassment because

of King's connections and character.

It should be emphasized to

Saltonstall that under no circunstances way this'informetion ever

be attributed to the Bureau.

S) STATEMENT REGARDING MARTIN LUTHER KING (See Page 21 & 22 O1 Article)

"Newsweek" further charged that a "feud" has arisen

between Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and me..

If such a ieud does exist, it is entirely one-sided,

because I have never engaged in a leud with Dr. King or any

other member of the civil rights movement. What I did do last fall

was set the record straight with regard to unfounded criticisms of

the FBI attributed to Dr. King which have received wide

publicity in the past.

On November 18, 1962, during an interview in

New York City, Dr. King was quoted as charging that FBI Agents

in Albany, Georgia, had sided with segregationists and had not

done an effective job

of investigating beatings and other

intimidations of Negroes pressing for equality in that area.

He further was quoted as remarking, "One of the great problems

we face with the FBI in the south is that the Agents are white

southerners who have been influenced by the mores of the

community," and that "everytime" ne saw FBI Agents in Albany

"they were with the local police force." He Implied that FBI

Agents of southern background are not "in agreement with the law

= 6 -

NW 55245 DocId: 32989661 Page .322

## Page 323

of the land" and, accordingly, that they "can't honestly and

objectively Investigate."

These charges cast a serious reflection upon the

integrity and impartiality of our Agents not only in the south

but throughout the entire service. Dr. King gave no factual

substantiation for these criticisms and, as a matter of fact,

our records clearly showed that lour of the five Agents assigned

at Albany, Georgia, were northern-born.

On November 30, 1962, we made a series of efforts to

reach Dr. King so that arrangements could be made for two of our

Assistant Directors to sit down with him and discuss his unsub-

stantiated charges, as reported in the press. After determining

that Dr. King could not, or would not, be contacted at that time,

we requested his secretary to tell him of our desire to talk to

him and ask that he contact us at his earliest convenience.

Dr. King never complied with our request.

When Dr. King's name arose during the briefing session

which I held on November 18, 1964, at the request of a group

of Washington newswomen, I stated that Dr. King was a "notorious

liar" in connection with his unfounded criticism of the FBI

Agents assigned at Albany, Georgia. This was not in the nature

of a "feud"; rather, It was an effort to set the record straight

on a false charge which cast a dire reflection upon the FBI's

reputation for fairness and impartiality.

In our Washington Headquarters. On this occasion, he asserted

that any criticism of the FBI and

me which had been attributed

to him was either a misquote or an outright misrepresentation,

and that he appreciated the work being done by the FBI in the

field of civil rights. However, despite our earlier effort to

reach him, the fact remains that Dr. King made no attempt to

straighten out the record with regard to the unfounded criticisms

attributed to him at New York on November 18, 1962, until after

my November, 1964, briefing session for washington newswomen.

The Committee may be interested to know that we

conducted a survey of the backgrounds of the Agents assigned

to our southern offices on November 13, 1964. This survey

disclosed that 1,316 of the 1,971 Agents in those offices were

born in the North. The remaining 655 were southern-born. That

is a ratio of two to one.

contribution to the service and that I should retire.

SECRET - OFF THE RECORD

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Activities in the civil rights movement during the

past year have moved Martin Luther King, Jr., and the organ-

Ization which he heads, the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, to the forefront of the movement. King today 1s

looked upon by the vast majority of our Nation's approximately.

20 million Negroes as their principal voice. An examination

of much of the brains behind this voice box is revealing as

to the extreme danger posed to our Nation's security in the

person of King.

• The repeated public claims made by King that com-

munism is Incompatible with his status as a clergyman and that

there are no communists in his organization is clear evidence

of the hypocrisy exercised by this defamer of the truth. He

has truly adopted the Hitlerian tactic of telling a falsehood

often and loud enough in an effort to make it more readily be-

lieved. But truth will out. King has surrounded himself for

some time with an organizational staff and group of advisors

upon whom he has become most dependent and who many times

direct his every decision. The backgrounds of many of these

individuals are such as to strongly argue against any claims

of naivety or coincidence which King may make.

principal of King's advisors 1s Stanley David Levison,

a long-time communist whose secret membership in the Communist

Party-USA has been established as recently as July, 1963.

While they have attempted to keep their personal relationship

covert and usually deal through an intermediary, we neverthe-

less have been able through highly discreet observations by

special agents of this Bureau, to place Levison and King to-

gether in personal meetings. March 4 and May 13, 1965, wit-

nessed clandestine meetings in New York City hotel rooms be=

tween king, Levison and other King advisors to discuss impor-

tant issues relating to-King-and the Southern Christian Leader-

ship Conference.) On June 9, 1965, Levison traveled from New

York City to Warrenton, Virginia, where he attended an annual

retreat and staff meeting of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference. Present were King and most of the top echelon of

that organization. On July 11, 1965, Levison traveled to At-

lanta, Georgia, where he spent two days in consultation with

King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference staff,

including dining at the King residence on July 12, 1965. Both

King and Levison attended the annual convention of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference in Birmingham, Alabama, on Au-

gust 9-13, 1965.

Another longtime communist and member of the Party's

National Committee, Hunter Pitts O'Dell, was, for public con-

sumption, separated from the Southern Christian Leadership Con-

ference because

the exposure of O'Dell as a communist. But

events of 1965 revealed

at King still calls upon O'Dell for

assistance. in connection with Southern Christian Leadership

Conference affairs.

The use of O'Dell as a principal communist tool was

underscored in July, 1965, when it was learned that O'Dell had

been hired on a full-time basis to work "secretly" in recruit-

Ing Into the Communist Party-USA Negroes from the civil rights

movement. O'Dell was to be given $5,000 by the party for this

assignment. O'Dell was also assigned to organize a delegation

of several members of the Party active in the civil rights

movement to go to Moscow under the auspices of "Freedomways,"

a publication concerning the Negro Ireedom movement which was

initiated and is financially supported by the Communist Party-

USA:

Additional key people with communist backgrounds in

King's "camp" include: Bayard Rustin (member of the Young

Communist League in the early 1940's); Clarence Jones (in the

mid-1950's a leader in the Labor Youth League - designated

subversive pursuant to Executive Order 10450); Lawrence Reddick,

Historian, and Randolph I. Blackwell, Program Director, both

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (Iormer Party

members); and Cordy T. Vivian (Lormer Party member).

It is not alone in the civil rights field that King

has used his influence. The Summer of 1965 witnessed his en-

trance into the public arena on foreign policy matters. In a

public address to a Southern Christian Leadership Conference

group In early July, 1965, at Petersburg, Virginia, King said

that he and his aides would study the use of "peace rallies"

and so-called teach-ins to bring pressure to bear on foreign

policy matters. He called for a negotiated settlement of the

Vietnam situation, demanding that the United States "even ne-

gotiate with the Vietcong." During a subsequent public appear-

ance, King was reminded that other civil rights leaders were

keeping separate the civil rights movement and the Nation's

foreign policy. King's explanation for tying these two mat-

ters together was that as a clergyman he felt compelled to

act on matters relating to peace.

It 1s most significant to note that when Levison se-

cretly met with King and other Southern Christian Leadership

Conference people in a New York CIty hotel room on May 13,1965,

The

the target for a determined concentration of communist effort.

Long-range communist strategy includes the establishment of a

Negro-labor coalition which the 'communists hope to be able to

thus, to provoke class struggle and promote legislation which

can serve as a

step toward a communist system of government.

TOR SECRE- OFF THE RECORD

Since 1956 Levison has expended much effort in King's

behalf in such activities as:

actively involving himself in

Iund-raising drives for King; serving as King's legal counsel

in selected matters;

preparing speech material for King; assist-

ing in the mechanics of some demonstrations in which King was

involved; guiding King as to acceptance or rejection of public

appearances and speaking commitments; and helping king with

matters related to the latter's writings.

King's Reliance on O'Dell, A National Party Functionary

Another key communist through whom the Party exerts

influence on king is Hunter Pitts O'Dell who,

at the Party's

last National Convention in 1959, was elected a member of its

second highest governing body, the National Committee. His

election was under a pseudonym. in 1960, while working as an

assistant to the Party's National Secretary for the South, James

Jackson, O'Dell also began to work actively in support of King's

movement. In June, 1962, 'KIng sought Levison's counsel concern-

Ing the 'addition of an'administrative assistant to King's staff.

'As a result of'Levison's recommendation of O'Dell, the latter

associated himself with the SeLc in Atlanta, Georgia, under the

name J. H. O'Dell and also served the SLO in Its New York of-

fice. In October, 1962,

several newspaper articles exposed

O'Dell's connection with the SCLC and his communist affiliations,

vas a result of which King announced O'Dell's temporary resigna-

tion pending an inquiry.
