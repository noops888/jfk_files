LUIGI MORICI, the boss in Baltimore

JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI

FRANK MALVASO.

CHARLIE BARBERA

MARIO ANELLO

FRANK CORBI

JIMMY CARONA, alSO Known as Jimmy Russo

Informant stated he recalled that his father had

told him that PATSY CORBI, brother of FRANK CORBI, had

been a member of the Mafia in West Virginia. Informant

_believed that FRANK CORBI is a member of La Cosa Nostra

because of his close association with LUIGI MORICI.

He

also felt that FRANK CORBI would have to be a member since

he heard that he was shaking down his

nephew, EDDIE CORBI,

the bondsman on Baltimore Street.

Informant stated that JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI had been

active in the numbers rackets in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

prior to

by other racketeers.

20 years ago, but had been run out of Pittsburgn

GIGLIOTTI had been friendly with the

VOLPE brothers in Pittsburgh, who were murdered about that

time. GIGLIOTTI had been tried for a killing in the Pittsburgh

a "eun"t not convicted and informant believed he is considered

for La Cosa Nostra.

Informant commented that it

is a mark of dishonor for an Italian to have his face cut

and that he believed GIGLIOTTI had also taken part in this

type of criminal activity.

He said that he had no proof

or even any perticular incident in mind, but he suspected

that GIGLIOTTI may have made trips out of Baltimore for

the purpose of

carrying out some sentence of La Cosa Nostra.

On October 21, 1965, Confidential Informant BA I-1

advised that GIACOMO ROMANO, also known as Jimmie Romano,

Essex, Maryland, had referred

Mazy lane

to the

MORICI and stated that "we are

family without a father." He had said that his leaders

were

then JIMMY RUSSO, also known as Jimmy carona,.

and one of

the CORBI brothers who operate on "The Block

• Baltimore

night club district.

Informant therefore assumed that these

persóns were members of a local Italian syndicate.
