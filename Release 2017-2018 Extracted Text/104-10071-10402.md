his-my name or address or anything about myself, except that I told me that

I had a wife and child whom I have not

seen for almost 3 years, In the U.S.

and had all of my papers necessary to leave here, except a visa to Mex100, I

cold him that I reason that I had wanted to leave here soon, was that uy wife"

was sick and I dia not want to wait until my Vexican Visa came through. After

1 hour of hin telling me how nuch he cared for Amerloans and for the U.s. eto.

he told me that ho would got me out,

by hiding me in a bofler until the ship

left Havana He sald that he could not hide me in his cabin, as he was afraid

that after the anio was searched, and I should be found, then he would

trouble, but if I should be found In the boiler, than he can Bay that 1or 1nto

I askéd him, how nuch?-and his answerdwas: &

sneaked aboard myself, without his knowledge 1500.00 (Fifteen Hundred)AlBRICAN

DOlLARs, after which d laughed in his fave, ane saked him where in the world

would a person in Cuba get 1500 Dollars, he woula not take posos, as he said

that he had thousands of pesos in his pocket that he made by selling American:

Cigarettes for 30 pesos per carton. Weld to male a long story short, I told him

so forget the whole thing, and the ship left here this afternoon for st. John

In Newfoundland. The usual charge here for getting people out 1a about 300

American Dollars or 2500 pesos, but this Captain thinks as all foreigners do

that Americans are all wealthy,

and as for doing sonething for a human being.

Ior nothing, well that they will not do. Il I had the money, I would never

pay 1t, lot alone even trust a man 11ke

this Captain. As It looks ko 1 W11

I am now going to try to get out or here by launoh,

I cannot stay here nuch longer 11ke Iam, and 1t 13 better for me to take a

at any time now.

I just came from tue Swisa Embassy again, and they told me

that they had not received an airwer. frum Switzerland regarding my case that

they had malled aoour 6 weeks ago,

and also that the only people who could get

a Mexican Visa for me, 18 the American Embassy In Mexico City. The Swies Embass

can give out advice every day, but as for doing anyruing, they are afraidont

bhe snios suwavy hero In Havana, a Cuban stands a better chance or getting

helped than an arerican, but I cannot any anything to them, as I am still here.
