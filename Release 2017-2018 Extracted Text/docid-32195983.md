Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

Senator Hart contacted the Attorney General personally

and asked the Attorney General to furnish the identity of a Bureau

informant.

The Attorney General instructed Steven E. Blackhurst,

Assistant Special Counsel on Intelligence Coordination in the

Department of Justice, to make some accommodation with regards to

"Senator Hart's request.

With the approval of Deputy Associate Director James B.

Adams, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division and Mr. Blackhurst met with

Committee staff members Michael Epstein, James

Johnson and Paul

Wallach on 5/21/76. At this time it was explained to the staffers

that the Bureau was unalterably opposed to the disclosure of the

identity of a Bureau informant.

Various alternatives were dis-

cussed with the Committee including a characterization of the

informant. Arrangements were made to meet again on 5/24/76 con-

cerning the same

matter.

On 5/24/76, a meeting was held with the same individuals

present.

At this time, Johnson, acting on behalf of Senator Hart,

no longer pressed for

the identity of the informant but stated for

their purposes it would be sufficient if they had a characterization

of the informant and a description of the types of information he

furnished, including information concerning organizations.

Special Agent Sam Miller of the Intelligence Division

advised that the informant who is MM761-S (former) has furnished

information on pro and anti-Castro activities by Cuban exiles and

was a member of the Cuban exile community. He stated that dis-

closure of this information would not compromise the identity of

the informant. He indicated he had talked to SA Vinicio Nasca of

the Intelligence Division who agreed with this. It should be

formation it would be within their authority as contained in the

agreement between Chairman Frank Church of the SSC and the

Attorney General. It is felt that we should furnish them this

information.
