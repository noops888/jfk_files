Dear Bob:

This letter is to correct some observations made in my earlier

letter of 23 February about the Cuban exile organizations. I seem to

have misunderstood some of the views given me by my colleagues at the

meeting at which we put together our comments.

Call it an "errata

sheet" on my efforts, if you will; perhaps it was in the euphoria

over the readability of the draft!

MIRR (C)

In addition to commenting on the incorrect description of CIA

relations with Johnson and Sturgis, it is noted that the source used

may be FBI reporting, which is not necessarily likely to be authoritative. (C)

Gobierno en Exilio (C)

Footnote 63. We do not have both references, so withdraw our comments

as to what both documents say; one may say what our copy of one of them

does not. (U)

Footnote 64. The cited document does not mention the described visit

to Somoza in Nicaragua.

It does reveal that Sierra visited Bogota, Colombia,

but he is not identified as one of the Cuban exiles who visited the Isle

de Andres. (S)

CRC (C)

Page 2, Footnote 14. Scratch our negative comment. The initial

concern was over the date of formation of the CRC (late 1960 or early

1961).

Stating that it was formed shortly before the 17 April 1961

Bay of Pigs operation is acceptable.. (C)

Sincerely,
