Source: Cuban National (Alien File #A-12570921) who asked for an

interview on occasion of first contact with CIA.

Cannot vouch for his bona fides. Had credential indicating membership

branch of revolutionary army's intelligence service, now in exile in U.

and maintaing connections with colleagues in that country.

A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.

To be done by poison - "Clostridium Botulinun" which is strong, odorless,

and tasteless.

Takes about 12 days to kill. About 5cc would do the job.

Waiting for next visit of major delegation from a Communist country --

members of the regime and that is when the attempt will be made.

2. Cable dated Oct. 3, 1961 - WA CITE NYOR 4902 Support (Travis) info I/A

Branch from Daniels. Source is Ernesto Dezaldo - Cuban Lawyer now

Stated the MRP in Havana is far less radical than

under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent

months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro

regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations

Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1,000 -- success

measured more in terms of fund raising ability and blowing up of buildings.

3. Information dated June 4, 1901, Subject: Underground Student leader

Comments on Post-invasion Cuba.

Reporting officer talked with

ISIDRO BORJA, on the leaders of BRE.

Borja says top DRE members in jail

or in a friendly embassy in Havana but said new leaders have been selected

and will resume sabotage activities shortly. Thought the underground could

restore tension in Cuba in 3-4 months.

However, said outside help needed

to get rid of Castro.

Claimed that prior to invasion, is was possible to

buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials -- they were tainted by

corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is

estimated to be around 80-85%. Most support is out of fear because the

people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of

Cuba working hard for release of former leader, Alberto Muller from prison.

alla: Bender, met with Ray In complete privacy.

"Unquestionably, the youthful, sortspoken, massuming, almost humde Ray

18. & natural leader of highest Intellect, deepest sincerity and convistion."

Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance 1s

concerned.

Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all. Cuban exiles

untied in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1950

constitution. Provisional governt of 30 honorable Cubans would be

established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed

at beginning of his regime to be promigated. State would regulate

private Investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "Jean and hungry" - each member to have specific

responsibilities and feel impattant to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive In Cuba and U.S. Also

asked for $10, 000 by next Wednesday - Bender made commitment.

belleves net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-

U.S. Jink and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.

Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being

supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem

to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of

the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained 1s

problematical.

traltor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and

supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations..

Says in

Cuban clandestine circles Ray 1s regarded as boastful, ostentatious andd

deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he 1s a man of anti-democratic

procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his own

movement.

Synopsis of paragraph 12.

the banks and public utilities.

Debriefing of

recently arrived from Cuba as a political exile. At a

luncheon meeting,

he reported as follows:

MRP formed In Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amallo Fiallo

Gonzalez, Dr. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera.

All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica.

The name of MRP

was suggested by Raul Chibas and In itself It does not constitute a party

or group but rather a coalition of several small groups, which were the

following:

8. The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray

b. Accion Democratica, led by DI. Fallo

c. Accion Verde Olivo, led by Dr. Rufo Lopez Fresquet

a. 30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)

e. Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos

I. DI. Valdez Pino, in asylum In Embassy of Peru and belonged

to Accion Democratica.

Dopinion of lay is that he had no way of judging whether

Ray is Communist or Marxist.

Lacks quality of leadership because he

does not publically hold to a definite political, social and economic Ideology.

He appears to agree with every person he talks to, never arguing with them

or opposing them, all of which shows he has no Ideology and makes him a

very dangerous man. Is extremely ambitous for himself, with great desire

these powers. Ray to receive $12,000 per year. Ray presently In

Origin of Autonomous Operations

Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by Higher Authority

in June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups

to supplement and assist in the execution" of other courses of action.

Concept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 In Walter Rostow's proposal for &

"Track Iwo" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-

controlled Cuban teams, CIA woüld extend financial aid and some advice and

guidance to independent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement Incorporated into June 1963 program.

"It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be

executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the

overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,

both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance.

2. The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost

In lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations

can be effectively halted by the withdrawel of U.S. support; but once halted,

they cannot be resumed.

3.

All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory

of the United States.

4.

The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly

any participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurate may

be the reports of Us S. complicity.

5. The United States presence and direct participation in the

operation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into an

operational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make 1t

clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except

to counter intervention by the Soviets. At experienced CIA officer would be

assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide

general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support.

He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations:

6. These operations would not be undertaken within a fixed time

schedule."

On Aug 24, 1964, Rogelio Cisneros called to report his resignation from JurE.

Stated Ray Incapable of directing both political and military activities.

Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not

prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray had

be,lieved he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba. "Ray is politically

unformed -- politically that which he last read". Cisneros further stated

that he believed Ray had planned his entire return-to-Cuba angle with President

Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. According to

him, Ray planned to make JURE and Ray outstanding: liberal and democractic

exile group with the thought that prior to the 1964 elections, Mr. Kennedy

would have to do something about Cuba. With Kennedy's death, according to

Cisneros, all of Ray's plans went awry. Rodriguez expresses to Cisneros

that this seems like a far-fetched possibility and Cisneros admits he got

Idea out of thin air, but said theory widely held within Directorate of JURE.

Memo for the Record - draft - dtd 22 Sept 1964 - Alfonso Rodriguez

"I recommend we give Ray what he asks and close the JURE books

for good.

If Ray Is succesful in Cuba he will not need our help, if he is

not, our help won't do much good.

"He is honest and at least the money will largely be spent for the

According to CIA files, Information ata Aug 1963 from a Cuban emigree source,

Roige was designated chief of intelligence by National Direction Abroad of

JURE.

Source said intelligence group created in March 1963 on orders of

Manuel Ray for purpose of infiltrating JURE members into various organizations

which operated in Miami area, as well as into agencies of U.S. govt.

Further,

that 1n April 1963, Ray had issued orders to infiltrate a JURE member Into CIA

In order to learn details of plans regarding Cuba. JURE also intended to

drop leaflets into Cuba of a derogatory nature regarding U.S. govt.

cluded in these leaflets was Subject's manifesto against the U.S. govt and

against this Agency.

4. Itr. ata June 2, 1966 from Dr. Julian Gallo to Harry (Mahoney?)

Gallo is contact with Ray. In Puerto Rico and trying to discover the names

.of Ray's contacts in Cuba. Ray, apparently is seeking a Mexican visa from

Gallo and unhappy that it did not come through.

Refused to reveal names

or addresses to Gallo and would not give information about where his radio

broadcast tapes were to be sent for transmission into Cuba.

Memo for the Record, ata 21 June 1966 from Charles Anderson

Met with Ray on 28 April 1966. Anderson said in general Ray had less

information on the "purge situation that I did.!

Ray said relatives

of Gustavo Arcos in P.R. had telephone contact with Arcos family in Cuba,

about 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him

were thin. "( This means there was at least one more telephone call than

we knew of previously, and this has probably served to increase the pressure

on Arcos)." Anderson tells of his concern and strong interest in Arcos on

the chance that Ray might assume Arcos had been CIA agent. Doesn't know

if Ray will construe remark this way but it seemed like an opening "to use

an important exile channel as a possible deception mechanism."

• "I believe that later in the summer it might be a good idea to have

another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exile thinking, and feeding more

deception thoughts.
