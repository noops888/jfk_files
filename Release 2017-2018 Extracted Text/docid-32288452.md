D' ARCO:

He mentioned that. I was with him this morning,

at 9:30 (with GIANCANA) •

I told him, I said,

SAM, if you think you're breaking this guy's

back by making him a Congressman,

wrong impression.

i vant to do i get him vue on the da) vang

Just one term, and then we'll see.

Now, what about the pinball machines and what

license?

Liquor licenses. Tell him to stop revoking them

licenses in the county.

There's supposed to be

some bill or something the County is coming out

with on pinballs.

Listen, SIMON is close to O'BRIEN, the District

Attorney. We ought to have O'BRIEN talk to him.

He's closer than CULLERTON was.

Yeah, we could let CULLERTON get ahold of O'BRIEN

then

to SIMON.

Was MOE satisfied with the Ward?

MARCY:

Yeah. I explained it to him.

The reference to MOE is obviously a reference to

Chicago top hoodlum SAM GIANCANA.

The reference to BERNIE

NIESTEIN is a reference to the State Senator by that name..

a minor politician in the Chicago area, known to be a favorite

/ Of GIANCANA.

The reference to CAIN is a reference to RICHAR

car, the chief investigator for the Cook County Sherift.

ILL

The reference to GIROLAMI is a reference to CG 6498-PC.

As the Bureau has been previously advised, on the last contact

Of GIROLAMI he advised the Agent handling him that he understands

that he is "on bad paper" with GIANCANA and that GIANCANA intends

to take his political position away from him.

This PCI also

advised that he understands that GIANCANA iS

"maneuvering" behind

the back of the PCI concerning Alderman AL TOMASO. TOMASO is

a protege of the PCI and was put into the Aldermanship of the

28th Ward by the PCI who is the Ward Committeeman of that ward.

The reference to JOE JAMBRONE is a reference to the secretary

of the 28th Ward regular Democratic organization, who is in

his position through the sufferance of the PCI.

The above

conversation obviously confirms

the information given ito. the:
