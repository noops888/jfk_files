Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1.

Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened

in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of. Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet

Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

• assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

i gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographat

site,

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

te gethe Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

tack gorden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

Grewas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel.

The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips..

LICALLA f1lm was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model

cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

foreigners. Their agents were were teet, and corrupt. A station

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers.

In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LlENvoY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two.

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here

again, there

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners, and cars with

foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif

ficulties.

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post operators

from a tap of the Soviet line.. It was picked up and taken to Mr. Boris

There was some delay because Station personnel

waited to compare the

for the telephone nunvers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Embassies.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the lexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 Yugoslav line. The basehouse listening

post had a live

monitor tro nade short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.1. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9 a..) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the

station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which rad

Russien or another languege besides Spanish or English vent

out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the!

reel )vas

tiped.. These reels were taken to another location thera they were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian heretions is

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Manell and his wife Borbara

handled all of the processi: g of Soviet transcripts. ly job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an American. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three tines a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days prestiously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operators cleared the carera each day whether there was animne a full

error did occur but generally the agents vere conscientious.

The Cuban

embessy coverage had more sophisticated equipment (a pulse ca:era) but it

frequently develored rechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnardi and Scathar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorne l'ackay screened

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention fron the

Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcripts every made in languages other than Spanish or

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN.

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is

still here.

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

Consulate

in Washington, he wants®

go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

That accordingly these transactions take

4 or 5 months but

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

then, they could not issue

the visa hege (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington.

Yet accordingly

(the American),

showed him a letter in which he (the

American) is a member of an organization in favor of Cuba

said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Soviet doesn't know what to do

with him, because he has to wai

the answer from

Washington.

the problem with him (the American)

is vert he does

arlyone in Cuba and in

that case it

is very diffi

to, give him a visa, because he was

thinking of

sessing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take a long time waiting for the Russian visa In

Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET:

.. that the thing is that if his (the American)

now in Washington (and) going to receive the

visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)

she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can

receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN:

SOVIET:

•. Certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul.

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA"' will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also

need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the

first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned outato be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

After

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more,

advising the (Department of)

Immigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person

and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as

a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

I0 AFTER ANALYZING ALL THE TRAFFIC AND READING THE STATEMENT

SILVIA DURAN, ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION STILL PUZZLES US-

WHEN LEE

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTEETA ASE"EARLY OCTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBANE

NSIT VISA, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER® ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT.

20 PLEASE RESTUDY YOUR LIENVOY MATERIAL AND GIVE US YOUR OPINION,

AND ALSO HAVE MEXICANS QUESTION SILVIA DURAN VERY CAREFUL!

THIS POINT.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

FBL have detailed records

concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living In Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DOID 4/2,

these porsons might be described as those who have either been

capable of provicing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communi st propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retured to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society®

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand thia list for the use of interested Bureaus of the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh So Cunning, Jo:

With regard to E - Mrsì, Paine, etc., we are working on that.

The wife is being interrogated. I don't know it that took place yesterds

or is still going on. You are getting a teletype answer on that. I am

just giving you a preview.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's ellegations that the man was in the

Cuban Emoassy on 18 Septenber, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtember. There is a

record showing entry into Mexico on Septenber 26. On about the 15th he

applied in New Orleans for a tourist caft.

We do know he was in -

I may even have some later largration maich came ila durtag tie aleat -

He was last seen by the landlady

Now we have migration records showing him

entering Medeo on the 2oth which very strongly suggests that he was not in Mexico

on the lath.

What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -

the 25th, 24th, and all the way back.. I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
