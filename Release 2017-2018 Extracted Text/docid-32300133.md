FRED PHILLIPS of the Registrar General's Depart-

ment, (commonly called Registry Office), Nassau, Bahamas,

has been known to the reporting Agent for a number of years

and has always been most cooperative. He was furnished a

list of the various insurance companies, agencies and firms

described in report of SA WILLIAM F. HOOD, JR.,

January 31, 1963, at Chicago, in the case

entitled "JAMES

RIDDLE HOFFA; CHARLES W. BRAY; ET AL" (Bureau file 63-7893),

but found that only the

following were registered:

British International Insurance Company, Ltd.;

Tropical Holdings, Ltd.;

Jonsphilips, Ltd. together with Intercontinental

Life and General Insurance Company, Ltd., which

turns out to be a firm operated by

JOHN MICHAEL

KEARNEY.

FD 302's are set out concerning the registry of

these four firms.

PHILLIPS stated that during July 16-18, 1963,

he had attempted to make discreet inquiries among his

contacts in the pertinent law firms as to the true

ownership of these companies but had met no success,

probably because the firms are inactive and the files in

the law firms would not be accessible to his contacts.

STANLEY R. MOIR

gation Branch, Bahamas Police, upon being

Superintendent, Criminal Investi-

asked about

TAYLOR ALBURY, STEVENSON and MOREE, officers and directors

stated that they were all members of the extreme

left wing of the Progressive Llberal Party and that it

interviewed, the next edition of STEVENSON's paper,

"The

Herald" would doubtless have a big headline about the FBI

snooping around the Progressive Liberal Party. For this

reason, no direct contact with these people is contemplated;

It further being suggested that they are merely figurehead

officers in this firm which actually was run by JOHN MICHAEL

KEARNEY .

Mr. FRED PHILLIPS of the Registrar General's

Department,

6,000 corporations listed in the Registry Office,

probably 75% of these corporations having been founded

the growing awareness

among

American investors and operators, of the tax advantages

offered by the Bahama Islands.

Mr. PHILLIPS further stated that approximately

half of these corporations are bona fide visibly operating

Mr. PHILLIPS stated that these reports consist

simply of any changes in officers, directors, capitali-

zation, etc. No reports are required as to operations,

finances, or employees or stock transfers.

Mr. PHILLIPS further added that there is a

statutory penalty of five pounds ($14.00) for each day

of delinquency in filing these reports, however, this

penalty is never imposed. Therefore,

Mx. PHILLIPS pointed

out, as to these 3,000 or so corporations whose operations

are not visible, and who do not file their reports, the

Registry Office

has only a list of incorporators, officers

and directors. Typically, such firms are incorporated by

an attorney whose fees run

from 100 guineas ($294.00) to

$600.00, the latter figure being that charged by STAFFORD

L. SANDS, the leading Nassau Attorney.

When such firms are thus founded through an

attorney's office, the stockholders, officers and directors

will invariably be clerical personnel of the attorney's

office and sometimes the attorney himself.

The purpose,

of course, being to obscure the true owners and operators

of the corporation. Mr. PHILLIPS stated that the incorpor

ating attorney, of course, will not furnish any information

as to the true

owners of the corporation, advancing the

attorney - client relationship as his reason.
