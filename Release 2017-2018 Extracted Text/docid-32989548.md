Reorganization - 1955

The Intelligence Division (ID) was known as the

Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) in January, 1955, and was

composed of four sections: internal Security, Espionage,

Liaison, and Central Research. Principal cases supervised in

the DID in January, 1955, were Espionage, Internal Security and

Nationalistic Tendency matters.

In August, 1955, the Internal Security Section was the

volume section in the DID. It supervised investigations

conducied under legislation, such as the Internal Security Act

01. 1950, Communist Control Act of 1954 and the Smith Act of 1940.

It also handled investigations of communist front organizations

and of subjects involved in possible violations of the

Neutrality Act, and Sedition, Treason and the Federal Train

Wreck; statutes and the Labor Management Relations Act. In

addition, the Internal Security Section was responsible for the

handling of violations of Federal Injunctions, security infornants,

Alien Enemy Control and related matters, and the Security Index.

The Smith Act cases alone demanded considerable time because of

the aspect of prosecution involving subjects of these cases.

The Internal Security Section was confronted also with the

prospect that the Supreme Court might uphold the Subversive

Activities Control Board order requiring registration by the

Communist Party, USA (CPUSA). and its members with the Attorney

Ceneral of the United States. It was anticipated that, if the

CPUSA and its members refused to register, a heavy burden

relating to prosecution of the organization and its members

would be placed on the Bureau and, consequently, on the

Internal Security Section.

It was concluded, therefore, that by dividing the

Internal Security Section into two sections, each headed by a

Section Chief, tighter controls over the supervision of the

various classifications could be maintained and the vast amount

of work moke effectively handled. Based on this analysis, the

Internal Security Section of DID was divided into two sections

during August, 1955. They were identified as the Internal

Security Section and Subversive Control Section. The new

Internal Security Section was made responsible for all sub-

stantive violations of Federal statutes involving the internal

security and the Security Informant Program. The Subversive

Control Section was assigned the supervision and maintenance

of the Security Index, the Emergency Detention Program and

maintenance of the Attorney General's portfolio.

Prior to the division, the Internal Security

Section had a total of 130 employees, which included 59

Special Agent: Supervisors. A total of 57 employees remained

in the newly formed Internal Security Section, including 24

Special I gent supervisors, a Section Chief, and Number One Man.

The Subversive Control Section was assigned a total of 73

employees including 31 Special Agent Supervisors, a Section

Chie::, and Number One Man.

Subsequently, the finding by the Subversive Activities

Control Board that the CPUSA vas a communist-action organization,

and, therefore, required to register with the Attorney General,

was upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court in June, 1961. As

anticipated at the time of the reorganization of the Internal

Security Section, the CPUSA and its officers and members refused

to register. Failure to register was subject to criminal

sanctions and prosecutions of the Party and its members were

instituted.

Subversive Investigative matters being handled by

the FBI in 1955 numbered 36, 975.

1964 Reorganization

The Intelligence Division (ID) was known as the

Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) in 1964, and the Internal

Security Branch was composed of three sections: Subversive

Control Section, Internal Security Section, and the Liaison

Section. Effective June 30, 1964, 112 Special Agents were assigned

to DID. Trlor to June 30, 1964, 48 Special Agents were assigned

to the Internal Security Branch. In 1964, there were 36,918

active subversive investigative matters and 5,622 active racial

investigative matters throughout the United States.

Racial unrest and related acts of violence increased

significantly in 19G4. Investigations and arrests arising out

of incidents of racial violence in the South clearly implicated

certain elements of the Ku Klux Klan which carriedout beatings,

bombings, murders and other violent racial actions.

Reorganization of the Internal Security Branch of

DID occurred in 1964, to afford improved supervision of the

increased volume of information received and to chart new avenues

of approach to effectively discharge our responsibilities in the

potentially explosive racial field. In July, 1964, supervisory

responsibility for investigation, of racial matters, racial

informants, Ku Klus Klan and related groups together with the

development of informants concerning these matters were transferred

From the General Investigative Division (GID) to DID. Five

Special Agents and approximately 1,350 cases were involved in

this

transfer. Three Agents formed the Racial Intelligence Unit

in the Subversive Control Section and two Agents formed the

Facial Informant Unit In the Internal Security Section. In 1965,

there were 37,818 active subversive investigative matters and

10,557 active racial investigative matters throughout the United

States.

In 1963 and 1964, a number of significant and fast-

moving events occurred which directly or indirectly influenced

the reorganization of the Internal Security Branch in 1964. A

brief sunmary follows: (1) In June, 1964, three Civil Rights

workers on their way from Philadelphia to Meridian, Mississippi,

later discovered, completely burned out. A massive search

Involving FBI Agents and other law enforcement personnel was

conducted, and 44 days later the three missing victins were found

beneath an earthen dam near Meridian, Mississippi. All had been

shot at close range. The ensuing investigation determined that

members of the Fu lux Klan of Mississippi, were involved in the

disappearance of the three victins, and a Klan official was sub-

sequently convicted on Clvil Rights charges. (2) One of the

most notorious and widely publicized murders involving Klansmen

occurred on July 11, 1964, when Lemuel fenn, a legro educator

from Washington, D. C., was killed by a shotgun, blast near

Athens, Georgia. Penn, an Army Reserve lieutenant colonel, Was

driving back fron a training session at Fort Benning, Georgia,

with two other Negro reservists. A group of Klansmen from the

Athens, Georgia, area, were subsequently arrested and charged with

the murder.

dynamitings, and other terrorist acts, and Klan history has been

replete with acts of violence. At a Klan meeting In South

INTERNAL SECURITY BRANCH

Reorganization, September, 1967

Prior to September, 1967, the Internal Security Branch

consisted of two sections namely, the Internal Security Section

and the Subversive Control Section. A review of the work being

handled by the Internal Security Branch was made and it was

recommended and approved that the branch be reorganized and

the Subversive Control Section be renamed Racial Intelligence

Section. This reorganization was put into effect utilizing

existing personnel.

The reorganization was made, in view of racial violence

that had occurred in several cities in the summer of 1967 and

the rise to prominence of young black leaders with "black power"

and revolution as their goals. For example, the student

Nonviolent Coordinating Committee changed from a cooperative

effort by whites and blacks to an all-black organization

advocating violence. Black revolutionary organizations with

such leaders as H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael were

prevalent and associated with violent demonstrations and

rhetoric.

Under the new organization of the branch the Internal

Security Section handled all matters relating to domestic

• subversive organizations and individuals associated therewith.

This section also continued to handle security informant matters.

NH 55093 DocId: 32989548

Page 14

---

## Page 15

The Racial Intelligence Section handled all cases

involving investigations with racial connotations including

black and white hate groups, black nationalist organizations,

associated individuals and racial informants.

This reorganization enabled a concentration of

supervision specifically related to the type of activities

and individuals involved. For example, the investigation of

the murder of three civil rights workers near Philadelphia,

Mississippi; which occurred in June, 1964, culminated with the

successful prosecution in October, 1967 of seven defendants in

U.S. District Court in Meridian, Mississippi. This investigation

which was

substantively handled by the General Investigative

Division was a product of coordination between that division

and the above Racial Intelligence Section which provided

much of the klan background information assisting in the

investigation and also provided for invaluable informant

input.

This

case essentially broke the back of the klan

groups in Mississippi at that time.

• The Anti-Vietnam War Demonstration in Washington,

D. C. (WDC), in October, 1967, is illustrative of the

extensive potentially violent demonstrations that were occurring

throughout the country during that period. Original plans

for these "spring mobilization" demonstrations called for up

to 1 million demonstrators to be in WDC and information was .

developed that they would take part in civil disobedience,

turning in of draft

cards, and various acts of violence.

Approximately 35,000 persons participated in the efforts,

most of which were directed at the Pentagon with approximately

600 persons being arrested. Statistics don't reflect the

attendant verbal and physical attacks against law enforcement

and guard officials nor do they account for problems which

arose as a result of the general immorality displayed by a

percentage of those demonstrators. The rioting following

the assassination of Martin Luther King, JI., on April 4, 1968,

received more effective and concentrated supervision under this

reorganization.

The massive anti-war demonstrations and racial violence

prompted President Lyndon B. Johnson to declare that "the

looting and arson and plunder and pillage which have occurred

are not part of a civil rights protest. It is no American

right to loot or burn or fire rifles from the rooftops."

He further stated that those in public responsibilities have

an immediate obligation to end disorder by using "every means

at our command..." and "if your response to these tragic events

is only business-as-usual, you invite not only disaster but

dishonor" and "violence must be stopped quickly, finally, and

permanently."

The case load in 1967 in subversive matters field wide

was 33,919 and in 1968 it was 36,154; in extremist matters in

1967, 9,457 and in 1968, 13,740.

The propriety of this reorganization was borne out

by increased work load assignments brought about by the

passage of the Anti-riot Laws and the Gun Control Act of 1968.

Reorganization, February. 1973

On 2/21/73, the Domestic Intelligerce Division was

reorganized and the name changed to Intelligence Division. Under

the new organizational structure, the Internal Security Branch,

formerly the Internal Security and Research Branch, was broken

down into three sections designated as IS-1 (Extremist Intelli

• gence); IS-?. (Internal Security); and IS-3 (Research). In the

restructuring, work formerly handled by the Revolutionary

Activities Section and the Internal Security Section was

combined into one section called the Internal Security Section.

In addition, the unit handling bombing matters under the

former Internal Security Section was transferred to the newly

reorganized Counterintelligence Branch of the Intelligence

Division. Under the new organizational set-up, the Internal

Security Branch was organized so that all domestic security

work would come under that Branch. Organizational change was

brought about because of the wind-down of the Vietnam War and

in light of public clamor concerning domestic security

investigations.

Changes were made to provide coverage in the

foreign field which had dropped to a dangerous level and to

reassure the public of the FBI's restraint in domestic

security programs.

As a result of the organizational changes,

the

CRAFT OF DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

Domestic intelligence is a comprehensive product

resulting

from the collection, evaluation, collation, analysis,

and interpretation of all available information relating to

threats and potential threats to the internal security of the

United States posed by groups and/or individuals within this

country. Pursuant to Presidential Directives, instructions

of the Attorney General,

statutes and Executive Orders, the

FBI obtairs this product through investigations which are

initiated to determine if violations of Federal laws relating

to Rebellion or Insurrection, Advocating the Overthrow of the

Government, Sedition, or other applicable Federal statutes are

being committed, and to advise officials of the Executive

Branch of Government of such activities so that an informed

assessment of the threat can be made.

Intelligence collection is the gathering and possession

of knowledge.

The area to which the process is applied supplies

the charäcteristics of the process. Intelligence collection is

done by investigation.

The collection of intelligence for

internal security purposes can rightly be called internal

security investigation. The comparison of an internal security

investigation to a criminal investigation will show no great

distinguishing features. Both utilize basically the same

## Page 30

techniques. What distinguishes the two areas is the goal of

each. A criminal investigation seeks prosecution. An internal

security investigation

seeks to prevent the illegal overthrow

or destruction of the established system of government.

This is the primary goal. Prosecutions do occur but they are

admittedly infrequent, and are not the ultimate accomplishment

of an internal security investigation. Therefore, intelligence

investigations are primarily concerned with the potential of

illegal activity while criminal investigations are premised on

the occurrence of a specific act.

There are two basic kinds of internal domestic intel-

ligence investigations: (1) the general assessment and (2) the

assessment of a particular group, individual or incident.

General assessments of potential for violence and civil disorders

are collected to provide the Executive Branch with a knowledge

regarding the potential problems with which it must deal. This

information is gathered nationwide from sources whose reliability

or good judgment has been displayed in the past.

Contrasted to general assessments

in geographical

areas are investigations which are directed at specific

individuals and organizations. They are investigated because

their activities include possible violation of Sedition,

•=2=

HH 55093 DocId: 32989548 Page 30

## Page 31

Treason and Overthrow of the Government statutes. Whether the

statute has been violated or will be violated is unknown to

begin with, for if the FBI waited for all the elements of the

violations to occur, there would be no law to enforce or govern-

ment to enforce it.

Some allegations or indications of subversion are

insignificant and require minimal information to refute or

to place them. in their proper perspective. Because an

allegation appears insignificant does not mean it can be

handled quickly. While it may eventually be determined that

a person poses no threat, an investigation is required to make

that determination. Additionally, the experienced investigator

knows that the full value of an item of information may not

be immediately realized. Often, an item of information triggers

an investigation only after it has been reviewed in context

with other facts.

Other allegations of subversion are not insignificant

and have proven to be of such stature and importance to require

INTERNAL SECURITY

THREATS - SUBVORSIVE

1955 - 1975

MOV # • 1975

In the domestic intelligence, or counter-subversive,

field, the FBI's primary concern in the time period of about

1955 was the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), and Socialist

Workers Party (SWP). Both are disciplined and structured

subversive organizations whose sole reason for existence is

to bring about the violent overthrow of our Government and

institution of a dictatorship of the proletariate. Of the

two, the CPUSA was, and continues to be, the most dominant and

resourcelul.

The CPUSA joined the Communist International (Comintern)

In 1921, accepting fully the 21 conditions for membership,

Including unquallited alleglance to the Soviet Union, Passage

•of the Voozhis Act in 1940 (subject to foreign control) caused

the CPUSA to disaffiliate from the Conintern in preierence to

registering with the Attorney General. During World Was II,

the CPUSA changed its name to Communist Political Association

(CPA) 1 line with Soviet efforts to solloit support of the

United States. In 1945, with the war threat over, the Comnunist

Party Soviet Union (CPSU) ordered the reconstitution of the CPUSA

as a ullitant, Marxist-Leninist organization.

Prosecutions against the CPUSA and its

leaders occurred.

The Snith Act trials in 1943-1949 convicted 104 persons. In

1957 the Supreme Court ruled the Government must prove "Incitenent

to sction" to sustain prosecution and the convictions were set

aside. These prosecutions resulted in the CPUSA operating in

The above trials, along with similar prosecutions of

James P. Cannon and other STP leaders, passage of the labor -

Managenent Relations Act of 1947, the Interual Security Act of

1950, the Conmunist Control Act of 1954, and the Labor - Nanare

ment and Disclosure Act of 1959 disclose a high level of interost

In connunist activity by the public,. Congress and the Executive

Branch. The FBI reneted to the extensive cormunist activity

and related legislation of that period by committing manpower

and resources to these investigations.

This situation romained somewhat stable until the

mid-1900s. The Vietnan conflict was becoming increasingly un

popular and the old-line comuist groups, CrUSA and SiP,

becamo extremely active 1n organizing massive and often violent

protesi against Government policy which in effect resulted in

at least moral sunnort for the communist North Viotnanose. In

nadition, many young people, whose lives were directly affected

by the Seloctive service System, ronctod in both poacoful and

violont opposition to the var. out of this turmois a number

of campus oriented, protest-type sroups formed. Some of these

groups evolved fron protost to larist ioninist rovolutionary

organizations, those primary aim and purpose was essentially

the same as the old-lina CPUSA except theirs was an avowed

allegiance to the Third World conmunist revolutionary forces,

exemplified by Fidel Castro and his successiul revolution in Cuba.

For example, the 1968-69 school year witnessed & heavy

wave of deronstratious and violence. During that year there

vere more than 850 decoratrations on college campuses, including

more than 200 insicaces of building seizures or sit ins. More

than 4, 000 Individuals were arrested for their disruptive

bohavior. Danago to school facilitios caccodod $3 pillion and

61 instances of arsons or attempted arsons voic committed. This

In alnost every category measiring unrest and violence, the

liques incrensed sharply ovor the previous acadomic year. In

1969-70 there were 1,785 dononstratious on college campuses,

including 313 building seizures by ranpaging students. Two

tundred and forty-sis arsons or attenpied arsons and 14 instances

of bonbing attacks vere committed. Nearly 7, 300 arrests were nade

in connection with those incidents, and damges exceeded $9,500, 000.

Eight deaths were reported and injuries totaled 402, nearly

two-thirds of which were sustained bi police and college oificials.

Not oniy have the colleges thonselves suffered. The

surrounding communities lave been severely affecied. for instance,

15311an Hustler, who directed the dofense of the now fanous

Chicaso seven, who vere tried for violations of Federal antiriot

statutes, spole to a rally at the Universliy of Californic at

Santa Barbara on Fobruary 25, He told his audience that if the

President would not listen to the people, then it was each

to demonstrate in Madison. They inflicted widespread

property danage which has been estimated at $270,000. In addition,

the payment of overtime to police departments and the National

Guard to control the situation during these disruptions reportedly

cost the taxpayers in excess of $300,000.

Another gauge of violence during this period is the

use of bombing as a political terrorist act. During 1972

there were 1507 bombings, 714 by explosives and 793 by incendiaries.

Twenty-five deaths and 176 injuries were reported with a total

property damage value of $7,991,815.

In 1973 there were 1529 bombings, 742 by explosives

and 787 by incendiaries. Iwenty-two deaths and 187 injuries

were reported and a total property damage of $7,261,832 was

involved.

Not all these bombings were by political terrorists,

but the bomb has become an increasingly used weapon in the

terrorists' arsenal.

The pressures from the Executive Branch, Congress and

public for evaluation of this activity and determination of extent

of subversive presence, as opposed to legitimate dissent, was

severe and required extensive reallocation of resources of the

FBI until the end of the Vietnam War.

INTERNAL SECURITY THREATS-EXTREMIST 1954-1975

Modern extremism as it effects law enforcement

can be traced to the 1950s and the U.S. Supreme Court

decision in 1954 outlawing segregation in public schools.

The Ku Klux Klan, which had its origin in the post-Civil

War Reconstruction days, had long laid dormant, but forced

• integration in the South pumped life back into it. Civil

Rights (CR) workers championing the rights of Negroes,

first on the issue of school desegrogation, then equal

facilities and finally voting rights, flooded the South in

great numbers.

Strong opposition by southern whites inflamed

tempers and various Klan organizations inspired or directed

actions against Negroes and the CR workers, which resulted

in the Birmingham, Alabama, church bombing, murder of

_thras

CR workers in Mississippi, and the murders of Colonel Lemuel

Penn in Georgia, and Viola Liuzzo in Selma, Alabama.

The Klan and its symbol, the fiery cross, became.

synonymous with activities directed against Negroes, Jews,

Catholics, and persons of foreign birth. A wave of floggings,

murders, kidnappings, and assaults began in 1950 and

continued into the 1960s. Acts of intimidation became sọ

prevalent that local grand juries met constantly and

hundreds of local arrests of members of the Klan took

place. As civil rights protests

increased, bombings became

more frequent in many areas of the South.

In March, 1965, then Senator Robert F. Kennedy

predicted violence in the South and North after Congress

passed voting rights legislation. Kennedy said, "I don't

• care what legislation is passed--we are going to have problems...

violence."

Violence reached such a stage that President Lyndon

Johnson, appearing on national television, warned the Klan

and instructed the FBI to intensify its investigations of the

violence being perpetrated in the South. While Klan activi-

ties abated, the 1y7Us have seen another stirring of the Klan

in antibusing activity as well as anti-Jewish and civil rights

issues in the Nation. Other white hate groups such -as the

National States' Rights Party, American Nazi Party and the

Minutemen had their origin in the late 195Us and early ly6Us,

basing their philosophy primarily upon white supremacy.

Arising almost simultaneously with Klan activity

was black extremism. A dissident group of former National

Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)

members in Monroe, North Carolina, under the leadership of

Robert Franklin Williams, fought back at the Klan. The

Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),. backing

DI. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference's drive for Negro rights, under tie

militant leadership of Stokely Carmichael and then H. Rap

Brown struck out both at the Klan and southern police.

Following close on the heels of racial violence in the South

came urban riots throughout much of the United States. Tie 1965

• Watts

Riot, in Los Angeles and the nationwide rioting following

the murder of Martin Luther King, JI., in 1968, were examples

of major disturbances experienced in U.S. cities. Black

extremists provided the spark which inflamed many of our cities.

Huge conflagrations

consumed Harlem, Watts, Detroit, Newark,

and our Nation's Capital.

In a July, 1967, address to the Nation President

Lyndon Johnson declared that "the looting and arson and plunder

and pillage which have occurred are not part of a civil rights

protest." "It is no American right," said the President, to

10ot or burn or "fire rifles

from the rooftops." Those in

public responsibility have "an immediate" obligation "to end

disorder," the President told the American people, by using

- 3 -

WW, 55093 - DocId: 32989548 Page 14..

---

## Page 45

"every means at our command...."

The President warned public officials that "if your

response to these tragic events is only business-as-usual,

you invite not only disaster but dishonor." President Johnson

declared that "violence must be stopped--quickly, finally

and permanently" and he pledged "we will stop it."

Racial tension in this country exploded into riots

and racial listurbances over 2UU times between 1964 and 197U.

Statistics reported across the country showed over 25u people

were killed, over IU, UUU were injured, and there was over a

quarter billion dollars in property damage. Civil disturbances

reached such proportions that a Presidential commission was

established and the Attorney General of the United States

instituted a data center so as to keep Federal officials aware

of riot conditions. •

Beginning

as early as 1963, mass demonstrations

played a major role in this country. Student unrest became

an important factor in demonstrations and with it came violence

to the nation's campuses.

Pronouncements like the following

were commonplace:

"This is a revolution. Reformists work within

• existing rules and regulations; revolutionists

make their own rules and regulations."

"We will use any means necessary to uphold

the principle that people of the third world

have a right to determine what kind of human

beings they want to be. Violence is the best

means. It disrupts and terrorizes so that

if people of the third world are not allowed

to determine their own kind of education, then

nobody else on that campus can get any kind

of education."

Jerry Wayne Varnado,

Black Student Union Coordinator

"Newsweek," 2/10/69

Statistics presented by The Senate Permanent Sub-

committee on Investigations of The Committee on Government

Operations in a publication entitled "Staff Study of Campus Riots

and Disorders, October, 1967 - May, 1969" indicate the extent

of the problem:

(The February, 197U, issue of "Security World" stated that,

during the period January 1 to August 31, 1969, losses speci-

fically traced to campus disorders amounted to $8,946,972)

The widespread and increasingly violent nature of the

problem prompted concern to be expressed by responsible spokes-

men from all quarters. On October 2, 1969, Senator Byrd said

-

that "events in the news in the past few days concerning

activities by militant radical groups should alert us to the

new trouble that is brewing on the Nation's college campuses

and elsewhere.".

Senator Byrd said that "all of us would do

well to pay heed now, and law enforcement authorities should

plan a course of action before the situation gets completely

out of hand."

Editorial comment in the September 28, 1970, issue

of The Washington Post was also indicative of such concern:

- 6 -

IN 55093 DocId:32989518 Page 47

## Page 48

"The college campuses have been targets

of bombings and other violent disorders

•..Certainly the FBI can be invaluable

in helping to crack such cases...

Certainly, the academic leadership must

be firm in cracking down on violence; so

should local authorities; so should the

FBI when necessary."

Out of these troubled times came such groups as the

well armed Black Panther Party (BPP), spouting revolutionary

rhetoric and engaging in acts of violence like killing police,

or "offing the pig" as they expressed it. Basing their philosophy

upon the problems of poor and needy blacks, and ostensibly

orienting

their programs to community needs, the BPP and other

violence-prone groups gained a threshold. The BPP, based in

Oakland, California, grew from 75 members in 1966 to 1,000U

members and 4U chapters throughout the U. S. by 197U. Describing

itself as "the armed body for carrying out the political tasks

of the revolution," it proclaimed the aim of the Panthers as

"We will not dissent from the American Government. We will over-

throw it."

- 7 -.

NH 55093 DocId:32989548 Page 48

---

## Page 49

From its inception the BPP leaders called for mombors

to arm themselves and learn how to use their weapons. The

police were the first target in the BPP program for "liberation"

of the black community and the violent destruction of white

America, Acts of violence traced to individuals affiliated

with the Panthers from 1967 to 1971 resulted in the deaths of at

least 12 police officers and the wounding of 71 others.

Separatist organizations such as the Republic of New

Africa and the Nation of Islam also offered the extremists the

opportunity to advocate violence and the overthrow of existing

society. Another form of black separatism emerged in the late.

60s and early 70s when large numbers of blacks turned to

Pan-Africanism, which is generally defined as total liberation

and unification of Africa undor socialism. Black extremists,

such as Stokely Carmichael, sought to achieve their goals

through this movement.

Groups such as the Congress of African

Peoples, African Liberation Support Committee, and the All

African Peoples Revolutionary Party were formed by extremists

who called for the destruction of capitalism.

"The 1970s have produced extremism of a different

nature. Militant Indians led by the American Indian Movement,

proclaiming long years of abuse by the white man, profess

to champion the cause of American Indians. Their actions

have

resulted in numerous confrontations with authorities,

including the takeover and destruction of both Government

and private property. Iwo FBI Agents were murdered on the Pine

Ridge Reservation in June, 1975.

Bi-racial groups using the country's prison systems

as its breeding ground have recently adopted many of the

tactics of guorrilla warfare. A prominent example in this

regard is the Symbionese Liberation Army which has employed

murder and political kidnapping to spread its message.

Extremist groups such as the BPP, which from its

inception promoted the stockpiling of weapons, have advocated

urban guerrilla warfare. While basing political philosophy

upon the teachings of MAO Ise-tung and other revolutionary

theorists, activities have been based upon the urban guerrilla

tactics used by Arab and South American revolutionaries.

Robert Franklin Williams, as early as 1956, wrote that the

salvation of oppressed American blacks was "a common household

match and a bottle of kerosine," Stokely Cermichael, speaking

over Radio Havana the day after the murder of Martin Luther

King, JI., statad "more people are now beginning to plan

seriously a major urban guerrilla warfare where wa can move

seriously to bring this country to its kneps."

## Page 51

Urban guerrilla warfare, as advocated by the Black

Liberation Army, an off-shoot of the BPP, has been directed

toward the overthrow of our present form of government.

While extremists espouse causes directed against the evils

of society, the first line

• of socioty's defense, the police,

bear the brunt of such violence. In addition to the 12 police

killed and 71 wounded between 1947 and 1971 by individuals

affiliated with the BPP, extremists have been responsible

for the deaths of 44 policemen and 35 civilians, with 158 police

and 129 civilians wounded between January 1, 1971, and June

30, 1975.

Extremists and terrorists have since 1971 been responsi-

ble for 127 firebombings, 17 arsons, 44 snipings, and numerous

other extremist acts.

SUMMARY OF

DONESTIC INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING

November 17. 1975

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREINS ENCLASSIFIED

I: Scope and Purpose of Bricfing

DATE 1Q/VO GO BYSALALMUG

This bricfing will serve as an introduction for the Committee

to those activities of the IBI's Intelligence Division during the

past 20 years which will be covered in public hearings.

The hearings

will pertain to programs (COINTELPROS) and'allegations of abuso (the

investigation of Di: Martin Luther King) undertaken by the Internal

Security Branch of the FBI's Intelligence Division. Therefore this

briefing will be a short history of the Internal Security Branch and

the issues raised by its activities. The activities of the Internal

Security Branch pertain to the FBI's efforts to counter internal

security treats, that is, individuals and organizations perceived

by the Bureau as

"extremist" or "suiversive" and not necessaril;

having any relationship to a foreign power.

It does not cover the

FBi's counter-espionage mission - its effort to counter the acti-

vities of hostile foreign intelligence services -- which will be

covered in an earlier briefing and which will not be the subject of

public hearings.

II. Internal Security Threats and the FBI Internal Security Program

A. Internal Security Threats -- 1955 to the Present

Bureau officials will describe those threats as being

at various times

the •Communist Party of the United States

(CPÚSA)., the Socialist workers Party (SWP) and other "old

line" structured liarxist-Leninist groups, the ku lux alan,

"Black Nationalists"

(black militants and some civil rights

organizations, e.g., Southern Christian Leadership Conference

ana Congress

of Racial Equality)

and the

"Ner' Left."

Tho

Bureau officials will provide a statistical analysis reflec-

ting changes in the threats as perceived by the Bureau for

the period 1955-1975.

B.

The Craft of Internal Security Intelligence

Burcau officials will provide a general introduction to

the techniques of Internal Security intelligonce as practiced

by the FBI. First, the distinction will be drawn between

intelliyonce collection and tracitional criminal investigation:

Second, the Bureau will explain the difforenco botween Interral

Security intelligonce gathering not necessarily directed at any

particular group or individual

and designed to assess a threat,

e.g., general intelligence on civil disorders; and more aggIes-

sive intelligence prograris directed at particular-groups and

Scope. and Purpose of Briefing

ALLINFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIEO

DATE 10/20/00 BYSMALMM

!

This briefing will serve as an introduction for the Con-

mittee •to those activities of thi FBI's Intelligence Division

during the past twenty years which will be covered in public

hearings.

The hearings will pertain to programs. (COINTILPROs)

and allegations of abuse

(the investigation of Di. Martin

Luther King) undertaken by the Internal Security Branch of the

PET's Intellynno Division is brieling will be a short

history of the Internal Security Branch and the issues raised

by its activities.

The activitics of the Internal Sccurity

Branch pertain to the FBi's efforts to counter internal securit!

threats; that is, individuals and organizations perceived by

the Bureau as "extremist" or "subversive" and not necessarily

having any relationship to a foreign power.

It does not cover

the FBI's counter-espionage mission -- its effort to counter

the activities of hostile foreign intelligence services -

which will be covered in an carlier briefing and which will not

be the subject

of public hearings.

The briefing will be divided into two parts,

the first

effarts

to corinter what

concerned with the TBI'sperception of the major threats to

the internal security for the period 1955 to the present and

how the jurcau has attempted to counter that threat.

This

The Craft of Internal Security Intelligence (This

section will be written by IBi officials.

• Bureau officials will provide a gencral introduction

to the techniques of. Internal Security intelligence as prac-

ticed by the FBI. First, the distinction vill be dravn betwcen

intelligence colloction and traditional crininal investigation:

Second, the Bureau will explain the difference between

Internal security intelligence gathering not necessarily

directed at any particular group or indiviqual and designed

to assess a threat, e.g., general intelligence on civil dis

ordcis; and more aggressive intelligence programs directed

at particular groups and their leadership and involving COIn-

TEUPROS

and criminal prosecution. (See,t. infra.)

c. Per Internal security polley

The articulated, policy of the FBI with respect to

internal security threats is set out in the FBI Manual of

Instructions. section 87 applies, to "Investigations of Sub-

versive Organizations and Individuals,":

and Section 122 applies

to "Ixtremist Matters and Civil Unrest." (See Tab i for the •

present version, of these sections.)

Section 87 defines "subversive activities" as "activi-

ties aimed, at overthrowing; destroying, or undermining the

Government of the United. States or any of its political sub.

divisions" by illegal means (Sec. 87.a.4.). Section 122 defines

"extremist activities" in the same way, but also includes

"denying the rights of individuals under the Constitution"

(Scc. 122. a. 1. e.). Thus the Section 122 definition of.

•extremist activities appears to include subversive activitics.

In practice, however,

"extremist' matters".has meant matters

concerning violence prone groups composed of menbers of one or.

IH 55093 DocId: 32989548 Page 57

## Page 58

another race. Section 122 is intended to cover what the

•Bureau calls "white hate" groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan,

and. "black hate" groups, such as the Black Panther Party and.

the Nation of Islam.. It also applies to incrican Ind an

groups such as the American Indian Movement, as well as. a

variety of terrorist organizations engaged in "urban guerrilla

warfare."

Section 37 has been applied to the activities of the

in the penses. r

"marxist revolutionary groups.".

Under this section the bureau has investigated groups ranging

from Communist Party USA and the Socialist Viorkers Party

to the National Organization. For Women, During the Vietnam

War period, Section 87

provided authority for

wel manginvestigations

of anti-war groups.

Manual Sections 87 and 122 and the general policy of the

Bureau with respect to internal security have changed over the

years as the fBI's perception of internal security threats has

changed. In the middle 1950's the only internal security

concern of the Intelligence Division was the section 87 "sub-

versive matters" area. Most

groups investigated under that

section vere perceived by the purcau as threats to the internal

security of the nation because of some formal or informal

relationship to the CPUSA or another "basic revolutionary

group." Section 87 was not designed to cover the iu klux

Klan

Until 1961 these matters wore eoverery the General Inves-

primarily

tigative Division of the F3I as criminal investigations.

The Intelligence Division gained jurisdiction over gruups

with race orientations in the early 1960's, when it was chaired

with administration of the predecessor of the "extremist

matters policy area (section 122): (At the time Section 122

• was captioned "Racial Matters") In effuct these groups becane,

for the Bureau, threats to the internal security:

Furthermore, with the evolution of the "new Left" and

as a result of the anti-Vietnam. war movement, the Bureau

revised Section 37 to place less emphasis on the old-line,

highly disciplined Marxist organizations that had been known

as "basic revolutionary groups."

• The FBI Manual reccived what Bureau officials

perceive as its

most significant revision. Since 1973 the Manual has required

each internal security case opened by the field to he related

to some actual or potential violation of a fedoralastatute.

"The statutory predication for an investigation must be desig-

nated in the first report on the case made to Bureau head-

quarters. The 1973 revision also provides, horever, that

## Page 60

"preliminary investigation" may be carried on for 90 days

for the purpose of establishing a statutory predication

without notifying headquarters. The practical effect of

sanctioning these preliminary investigations will be dis-

cussed in Section III. D. infra.

D. Organization of the Internal Security Branch

The organization of the FBI in the conduct of its internal

security function has; like the various Manual sections,

changed as the FBI's perception of the threat and the result-

ant workload has changed. From 1955 to the present, the FBI

has been organized to provide maximum control by FBI head-

quarters of the activities of the field agents who do the vast

majority of the Bureau's investigative work.

At present, internal security intelligence matters are

supervised by the Internal Security Branch of the Domestic

Intelligence Division. (See Tab B for a chart of the overall

organization of the FBi.) The

Special Agents of the

Internal Security Branch are divided into three sections.

IS-1 Section has jurisdiction over Manual Section 122 investi-

gations! "Extremist Matters and Civil Unrest.". IS-2. Section .

covers Manual Section 87, "Investigations of Subversive Organi-

zations and Individuals." IS-3 is the research arm of the

Internal Security Branch. Thus, like the Manual, the Branch

is organized around what the Bureau perceives to be the two

"New Left" groups, CPUSA and Socialist Workers Party).

• There have been five major resiganizations of the Intel-

ligence Division since 1955, each resulting from significint

changes in the role of "extremist" and

"subversive" elements

in American society, the FBI's perception of their threat to

the government, and. the change in the Division's workload

in the internal security sphere.

1.955

In 1955 the Division undertook a major rcorganization as

a result of the burgeoning workload of the predecessor of the

• Interna?

Security Branch. At that time internal security

matters were handled by the Internal Security Section, which

concerned primarily with the CPUSA and its infiltration of

domestic oxganizations: By 1bg6 the allegations of such in-

filtration were so numerous

that the section had to be divided

and its manpower increased significantly. The total number

of internal security matters handled by the Division had in-

creased from

FbI increased headquarters manpower from

on allogations that individuals were either members of the

CPUSA or front organizations: The Internal Security Section

retained responsivility for' actermining which organizations

were subject to Communist infiltration. Thus the Subversive

In I961, racial matters were transferred to

In 1907 another major reorganization was undertaken to

respond to the increase in workload resulting fron the Bureau

interest in black militancy ana the so-called "New Left"

Basic Intelligence Gathering Tools

The basic intelligence gathoring tools used by the FBI

have depended upon the seriousness of the threats and the

willingness of the courts and Congress to permit their use.

• The most overt intelliyence gathering tool is an inter-

view of the subject. There are no restrictions, other than

- internal FbI policy, on

the use of this technique. Agents

An informant

Is an individual who is paid by the FBI

for information on a continuing basis. He is usually a

member of a target group, and may have joined the group on

• Burcau instructions., His activities as a member. of the

group are directed and controlled by the FBI.

A confidential source

is an individual thu has provided

information to the FBI on a confidential basis but who is

not necessarily paid for the information. According to FBI

officials the key distinction between an informant and a

confidential source

ist

that A confidential source provides

infornation that he has access to because of his joh or his

position in the community: He does not obtain such access

at the direction of the bureau; the information is already

available to him when

"Is contacted by the FBI. Among im-

portant confidential sources are school addinistrators, news~

paper reporters, bank presidents, telephone company officials,

and law enforcement officers. In many cases the information

which these sources provide to the Bureau has been obtained

from official records: Lan, lubrissi

As the Conmittee will see in'its public hearings on tha

COINTELPRO program and on the informant program, both infor-

miants and confidential sources have boon used from time to

time fox purposes other than information gathering. Confiden-

tial sources and informants played an important role in dis:

Until 197?, electronic surveillance was another very im-

portant covert intelligence gathering technique used by the

- Internal Security

Branch and its predecessors. In 1972,

however, the Supreme Court held that, unlens the rBI had reason

to believe that its targets are agents of foreign governments,

for use in the Conmittec's final

report.

FBi policy on the use of electronic surveillance for

internal security purposes was never articulated in its

Manual of Instructions..

- the use of electronic surveillances, gen-rally, vill be covered

in a separate briefing immediately preceding the presentation

of the public icarings on the FBI's investigations of DI. King

and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

Until 1966, the FBI used a number of other sensitive

covert techniques against internal sccurity targets. These

included surreptitious entry or "black bag jobs", mail sur-

veillance, and trash covers. Director Hoover ordered use of

surreptitious entry terminated. in 19G6. (Sèe Tal

recent FBI memorandum suggesting that not only were

such

operations engaged in agáinst donestic targets prior to 1966,

but

Physical and photographic surveillance are covert techniques

that continue to be used by the FBI. The king case is a good

•example of the use of such techniques. In the six years

DI. King was under invostigation, he was subject to either

physical or photographic. surveillance on at least occasions.

There are no comprehensive Bureau policies on the use of

these techniques against internal security targets; neither

are there federal statutes or court decisions which place any

The Internal security Branch or its predecessors have

programs and b) until April 1971, specialized extralegal

programs of "neutralization and harassment" callod COINTEL-

The special investigative programs vore designed

to give headquarters administrative control over field inves-

tigations of the "extremist" and "subversivc" arouns and

were most

frequently characterized by the development. of

specialized indices. These indices gave headguarters a

the techniques of counter-espionage, including "misinfor-

mation" and "double cross:" These techniques were first

used by the british against the Germans during swill but vere

perfected by CIA and FBI against the Soviets during the

Cold war. In CPUSA-COINTELPRO the Burcau sought.by covert

neans to disrupt the party by exploiting factionalism and

to discredit the party in the eyes of the American public..

As other threats arose, the Bureau applied similar techniques

The major investigative programs included general programs

directed at all internal security threats. Among these were

a series oê indices initiated in 1939 as part of a program

of identifying individuals who the IBI perceived as probable

•threats to the internal security in case of national emergency.

At various time, lists of persons who posen such threats were

known as the Custodial. Detention List, the Security Index,

and the Naministrative Index. It was anticipated that indivia-

uals on these indices would be detained or considered for

detention or for

more intensive surveillance if such an

emeryoncy were to duvelop. The detention plan preceded its

statutory authority (Title II of the Internal Security Act of

19501 and survived an explicit order by an Attorney General to

Title. II detention provisions in 1971, the Bureau continues

to mehtain a list of about

15,000 persons io were included

on the Security Index for detention purposes. A list of about

1,200 persons, known as the Administrative Index, is based on

names selected from the Security Index. Persons on that list

are described by the Bureau as current threats to •

inter-

nal security.

While statutory authority for the detention program existed,

the r'BI maintained a special indes, the Reserve Index,. on

• indiviauals who might be candidates for the Security Index

and ultimately for detention. Thile the Justico Department

supervised the Security Index, no one outside the FBI knew

about the Reserve Index..

Other programs were directed primarily at the CPUSh and

other communist

organizations. and their fronts. Leaders of

the Party received special investigative attention. "Top

Functionaries," the highest level Icadership of the Party, and

"Key Figures," the second echelon leadership, were included

in the Security Index and tabbed for priority detention.

While investigative reports on most

Security Index subjects

were required only annually; quarterly reports vere required

for Top Functionaries, and semi-annual reports were required

for Key figures.

heading. In April, 1965, however, the "extremist matters"

Manuai section (122) was revised to emphasize "black hate"

as well as "white hate" groups, and the Bureau began to con-

centrate on what it labeled "Black' Nationalists." As a

result of the urban ghetto riots,. a special inder was created

to cover the leadership of the Black Nationalist movement.
