Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO

NOSENKO is a Soviet intelligence officer who defected

in Switzerland in 1964. He was subsequently brought to the

U.3

and after a short period of relative freedom, he was

confined under strict and relatively austere conditions

Commencing in

1967, he was given increasing amounts of freedom until he

was allowed total freedom in 1969.

he subsequently married

a U.S. citizen, settled in the Southeastern United States

and became a U.S. citizen in 1974. He is presently under

contract to the Agency, providing

consultative services

and information on subsects germane to his background.

NOSENKO was confined then as a result of his debriefing

substantive questions

were raised concerning his bona

and his general behavior raised further concern about his

emotional health and general safety.

NOSENKO's debriefing

and confinement were ended when it

was, not a threat to national security.

of his status during his confinement up to the time of his.

final settlement.

The strict conditions of NOSENKO's confinement were

intended to convey to him the seriousness of his position

as a suspected disinformation agent and to make clear to him that

his free settlement in the U.S. was precluded as long

this issue was unresolved.

It was understood, however,

that at any time he could have elected to end his confine-

ment and return to the Soviet Union.

OS files do not document

that this latter condition was explicitly conveyed to

NOSENKO, however, it is the recollection of senior staff

officers (ADD/0 and D/OS): that such was the case, and further

that it was a condition routinely applied to other defectors

whose bona fides were in doubt.
