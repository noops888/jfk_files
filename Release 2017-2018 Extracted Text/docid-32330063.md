Memorandum lor Mesars.

Tolson, Mohr, Parsons, Belmont, Deloach

stated Pearson had jumped on Vice President Nixon for having tried to prevent

the prosecution of flotta and successfully preventing the Indictment untul after

the election and then the Attorney Ceneral had gone ahead and indicted and

now leaves it all on the now Attorney Goneral. I stated I did not know whether

Nixon interceded and I had my doubts, but, on the other hand, the case in

florida againet nore io fairly strong and i thought the indietment was proper.

I stated I did know it had been hold up a long time before finally going abead;

that the Special Assistant on the case, Dowd (phonetic), seemed to be a capable

fellow and he had been trying to get an indictment for some time but there was

a question as to the individuals to be included, that there was no question about

Rofia, but a question about a third party in Detroit. I stated now Pearson le

trying to make it appear as it it were done just as a dyine gasp by the current

Adinistration and I think there would be the same reaction in the Masterrer

case.

I advised Mr. Yengley that he could use the information about the call

from Devine and indicate the position we took and it seemed to me that the State

Department ought to put in black and white what they want done. Mr. Teagley

stated he thought he has to asis them to. I stated this was loaded with dynamite,

bocause of the way the public has been reacting in Florida; that thore is a hatred

of Castro and I cited some ineidents which had oceurred while I was recently in

Miamt and it seemed to me that with that kind of publto opinion, they were laviting

great trouble if they weat ahead against Masterrer. Mr. Yeagley stated he thought

I was right and he aspreciated may help.

I mentioned to Mr. Jongley that I thought Masterred was under some

Kind of Immigration bond to refrain from certain activities,

but I did not know.

Lix. Yeagley said that was a good thought.

I stated there wore several factions

of the busans who wero anti-Castro, out each one wants to be king..

vir. Teagley

stated that might be what is behind this and mentioned that the Senate Committee

ts going to start invectigation next week of this follow Wieland, I stated George

Sotolaky had come out with a column and Senator Bastland's Committee was going

to hold public hearinge on him as they think they have an Alger Hiss case.

that preasure to go againet Masterrer may emanate from elements like this in

statoland CIA. I stated CIA has a group training to go over and invade Cuba and tela)

Memorandum for Messro. folson, Mohr, Farsons, Balmont, Dal oach

[overthrow Castro and while it is supposed to be hush-hush, around Sliami it is

more or less publie knowledge; that Castro probably Inowe about it as he tas

his agents over here who, no doast, have penetrated the group; that Masterrer

has not joted the group that CIA is backing and it may be some elements like that

are involved. Mr. Loagley stated he could not say he has been told but it has

been interred that they did not want masterzer in. I stated Masterrer was wealthy

and I thought he got some money out of Cuba before he came to this country, but

ho has connections and is getting money and living in ease and comfort while other

relugoes are serving as waiters,

et cotera. (i stated Masterrer has not been

allowed to joto the group CIA has been supposed to be secretly backing and

there say be some motivation to tay to knock him old, bus i would bactre

against Justice and not CIA dE(M)

(Mr. Jongley stated they have & case where they would normally go

ahead and Indict with one count and maybe more, and he can't say don't do li, bat

the State Dopartment can.] I stated it seems in view of the action of the President,

it does not make sense and I did not see how getting an indictment against

somebody trying to overthrow Castro can be explained to the publie. I stated I

toad noted in the pross that it had been intimated by somebody in the State

Department that the only way diplomatie relations with Cuba could be resumed would

be the overthrow of Castro and here you wold be promecuting somobody who may

not have the good will et our Administration but who wants to remove Castro

Wand has more facilices zeally than some ot these groups with ola backing.

stated the sympathy down in Miami ta all with the anti-Castro forces and IT

ll any move is made, it ought to be at the spectile request of the State Departuent

and it should be in black in white, that it ought to be put in waiting by them.

(sir. Teagley stated that was excellent and he thought that is cructly the

Kindl of help he needed and he would let me know the outcome. He stated we had
