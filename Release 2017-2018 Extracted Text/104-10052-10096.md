DISPATCH SYMBOL AND NO.

HMMA -21845

On 5 June 1963 Douglas J. FEINGLASS, Staff Agent, arrived in

Mexico to replace Howard G. SAFARANO, the Station translator for Russian

language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines. SAFARANO

departed PCS on 18 June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations

officer.

FEINGLASS' usefulness to the Station is handicapped by his inability

to transcribe the Spanish portion of the reels from the Sovie coverage. This,

• despite Headquarters assurance that he coud do these transcriptions.

Howeven

he has settled into outside living conditions with a minimum of difficulty.

For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY tap center is transcribing the

Spanish portion of the above take.

There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes

numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS

was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish.

The backlog is being

retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives. In addition to the Russian trans-

criptions, FEINGLASS also clips the transcripts for individual dossiers thus

relieving the Station Case Officer for Soviet operations of a clerical task.

After the arrival of HORSFALL, the Mexico Station will review requirements

for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of

FENGLASS.

In early June to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested

full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines. In addition, Thomas G.

URQUHART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the

LIENVOY tap center to review the traffic on a current basis.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY information.

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided

details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data.

In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance

information when reservations were made. Confirmation of the travel is,

of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might

be U.S. citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for

political or other reasons. On 20 May 1963 an English speaker identifying

himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political

asylum for himself, his wife and seven children. Subsequent investigation

revealed that he was also a protection case at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.

Appropriate U.S. agencies were advised of Subject's contact with the Soviet

Embassy.

5. Liaison.

During this reporting period there were no meetings between the

Chief of Station KUBARK and LITENSOR; however, regular contact was

maintained with LIELEGANT and LIERGO.

6. Security.

There were no security incidents within the project during this

month. As reported in MEXI-5170, 26 June 1963, the

true name of a

KUBARK case officer was revealed to the Cuban Embassy by a caller who

refused to identify himself. From the transcript it appeared that the Cuban

Embassy was not interested in making contact with the caller who claimed to

have details of KUBARK operations in Mexico.

7. Technical.

Arnold AREHART, staff agent, has kept the equipment working

effectively. As Headquarters is being advised by separate cable, the Mexico

Station does not plan to replace the present LIENVOY equipment until the next

Presidential candidate is named, assuming of course that this will occur within

the next few weeks.

8. Personnel,

On 17 June Robert B. RIGGS resumed meeting Arnold AREHART and

routine case officer functions for LIENVOY. Gregory PARMUTH meets

Douglas J. FEINGLASS daily to deliver and receive the Soviet Embassy

traffic. PARMUTH's assistance in obtaining living quarters and necessary

sterile office furniture was responsible for the ease with which FEINGLASS

was able to settle into his outside staff agent status.

In the opinion of Thomas G. URQUHART, who has spent some time

inside the ap center, Arnold F. AREHART is doing a commendable job in

the management of the center. In addition, AREHART has a general aware-

ness of the take from each line. When leads of interest appear, he notifies

the Station immediately so that action can be taken.

Willard C. CURTIS contacts LIENVOY-2 when the Station desires

contact with the Mexicans directly or when AREHART is absent.

9. Production.

The volume of paper produced by this project is hardly reflected in

formal disseminations, operational cables, and dispatches which numbered

39 during June. The daily summaries, the transcripts from two Czech lines,

five Soviet lines, and five Cuban lines are retained for background use in

Station files.

They could be more fully exploited for reporting purposes if

personnel were available.

There is attached a lisi of reporis, cables and dispatches forwarded

to Headquarters during his month.
