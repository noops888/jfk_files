Since the LIFEAl' Project Renewal Request forwarded by referazoe (a)

contalued a thorough revlew

of the LIFEAT projeot for the entire project year

through May 1963, most of the items of interest to the project were Inoluded in

the revier through that date.

The following report contains those items not

fully reported or

not inaluded in that revier plus items of interest couring

during June 1963.

Except for the above noted period, LIFLAT progress reports

•generally will be forwarded on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis.

The following report 1a submitted in accordance with CSFibF 52-6-1,

section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).

EXPLOITATION OF LEADS

(1) LIFEAT/Sovlet =

During the reporting period LIFEAT has

continued its daily coverage of the home phones of two known

Soviet Intelligence officers.

Information and leads fron this

coverage provide the Interested Station Officet with a valuable

check on the Soviet contacts of several KUBARK controlled

double agents.

There 1s also provided the type of information

on dally activities of Soviet personnel without which the plan-

ning for and suocessful completion of the technical surveillance

operation against one of these Soviets would have been impossible.

Station believes that LIFEAT contribution to the success of this

operation deserves particular mention.

concerning Cuban cormercial cantacts and purchases.

(5) LITEAT/EXIle - LIFEAT Coverage of ESLARD-I has been must rewarding in

terms of his contacts, travel, and future plans.

This Information

.:has been of interest to Headquarters. LIFEAT has exerted every effort

to provide continuing coverage of this target even when ESIARD-1

resided in a hotel under an allas and following his move to new

quarters.

Coverage by LIFEAT was especially difficult during E-l'e

stay at the hotel stnoe the technical problems were considerable and

the

processing of all calla to and from the hotel in order to extract

E-l's calls was a heavy burden on the LIFEAT processor/translator

start.

It Is noted that in Station's opinion the LIFEAT complex

showed up particularly well In this assignnent.

LIFEAT coverage orl

Inas been especially

frultful concerning the travel and contacts of Costa Rican Communists,

Including their travel to Cuba. It has also provided some leads

concerning ZRKNICK operation.

(6) LIFEAT/American Communist Group In Mexico (ACGM) - During the reporting

period local ODENVY requested

that LIFEAT coverage be initlated on

David DRUCKER, prominent member of the ACUM. Product from this

coverage, 1n

conjunction with that coverage already being provided

on Charles SMALI (aka SHOLIKOFF), 1s valuable to ODENVY in providing

data on U,3, Communists who travel to Mexico and contact the nembers

of the ACCM.

Information 1s also provided on the dally actlvities

and contacts of members of the ACM.

(7)

LIFEAT Miscellaneous - Coverage of a former SNOTH agent at the

request of Headquarters resulted in the knowledge that this former

agent was In contact ith a number of Soviet Satellite personalittes

and was exercing a strong Influence on a frlend of his, a PBPRIME

eitizen employed as the local representative of a well known PEPRIME

news media.

It became apparent that the PBPRIME oitizen, through

his connection with the news media, was being encouraged by the former

SMOTH agent In an attempt to

"destroy" the senior ODACID official

in Mexico.

Early warning to this official resulted in action which

greatly diminished the effect of this effort.

Coverage of both the

former SMOM! agent and the PBPRIME citizen is being continued.

LIFEAT coverage was also placed on the, private office of a

| army General based' on a lead that he was the contact of

former

a number of

who was guiding

army officers of troop command rank who would. sup-

Jin any show of force.

vided no Information of value and wes discontinued.

which LIlEUD-1 conducted for the

nine years ag0. At no time has LIFDUD-1 mentioned LIFEAT operatious

Since LICOACH returned to his native Western European

country l june 1963, LIFBUD-1 will not be told that LICOACH was not

in LIFSAT employ.

However, LIIEUD-1 has been reminded never to

speak with anyone about LIFEAT without firs' discussing it with
