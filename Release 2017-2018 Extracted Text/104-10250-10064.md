WASHINCION INDEPENDENT - #524424 (RICHARDS, Guy)

Reference file contains a transcript of the Barry FARBER Show over

Station WOR-AM, New York, on 3 May 1967 entitled "Journalists Discuss

CIA NAD Espionage"

'. RICHARDS was queried regarding his book on

GOLENIGHSKI and his views on the CIA.

RICHARDS' replies were critical

of the Agency. Quote RICHARDS: "Now, let's take a look, for example,

at the Central Intelligence Agency in the year 1967. If history were

ever to be made of the great American bureaucracy, I think it quite

correct to say that they would pause and pay homage to a remarkable

fact, namely, that in the form of the Central Intelligence Agezcy, there

has suddenly been created and evolved a great idea, namely, the idea of

combining the FBI with Santa Claus with the British East India Company

with Barnum & Balley and the Ringling Bros. Circus. And before we

get lost in the derision that this Implies, let's take pause on two

very positive possibilities. One, that this may not be such a bad

Idea at that. It may take its form among the great diversions."

WASHINGION INDEPENDENT - #524424 (De BAGGIO, Thomas)

Thomas De BAGGIO, editor of the WASHINGTO INDEPENDELT, a newspaper

described as part of the Underground Press Syndicate, was brought to your

attention in May 1967 byl

CIA employee, who resides In

the same apartment house as De BAGGIO and who was concerned about

meeting De BAGGIO because of the nature of the paper published by De

BAGCIO. OS conducted inquiries on De BAGGIO and furnished the results to

Mr. GOODWIN's office who had had a request from De BAGGIO to verify

GOLENIEWSKI'S CIA employment. At the time De BAGGIO called GOODWIN's

office he mentioned he knew Herman KIMSEY but had not seen him recently.

COODWIT's office gave De BAGGIO a "No comment" reply.

Of interest is

Mr. SAYLE's meno for the record dta 6 June 1967 in which he speculates

that Capital Fill editor for the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, Charles BOISE,

may be identical to Carl BLOISE, new Washington correspondent for

the PEOPLE's WORLD and reputed stringer for SUNDAY RANPARTS.

Also, of note is the fact that De BAGGIO appeared of the same

Barry FARBER show

as noted above for Guy RICHARDS.

SPECIRUM

Os indices are negative on SPECTRUM. NOIE: Speculation would be

that SPECTRUM may be a new name for the WASHINGION INDEPENDENT. This

could be verified.)

JANUARY 27, 1968

Mr. Herman Kimsey

Hotel Vivian

1723 "G" Street NW

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Kimsey:

On a recent trip to Washington,!

and I

had the pleasure of discussing

topics of mutual interest.

One of them was the Romanoff case and of course your name

was nentioned.

It was!

feeling that an article should be

written

about Romanoff for Reader's Digest.

But he

cautioned that no material could be included which wauld

put CIA in a bad light.

He said this was what kept Guy

Richards book.

IMPERIAL AGENT, from being condensed by

the magazine.

said it was his belief that the

Digest would

not print articles which were anti-government

in its view and any article which was critical of CIA was

seen to be anti-governmert by Digest edito=

He suggested

that with your background and contacts you: --i be able

to aid me in the preparat on of such an art....i

:: the

extent of guiding me throigh the ci:-rough .... ' of the

case.

I have not yet begun the preparation of such an article.

I do not believe that l

had your permission in

offering your advice. I would appreciate your comments

on the idea.

As I have only talked with you briefly during the tie

that I edited and published the Washington INDED.DE I-

and w=e several stories dealing with the Roma. •= case

perhai. it is not fair to ask any favors of you it alb, oi

impinge on your valuable time with long letters requiring

lengthy replies. • But I wonder if you, with your intimate

knowledge of CIA functions,

would care to comment on recent

disclosures made in RAMPARTS Magazine. These disclosures,

• which were much on my mind as well

as :

• deal

with Me. Jim Garrison's investigation into the assassination

.:.

of President Kennedy. In particular I wonder if you would

comment on the disclosures dealing with CIA involvement in

the assassination as well as specifically the following

quote:

"It is fair to say that not much in the way of Caribbean

intrigue went on in those days without the ClA, or at

least CIA operatives having a finger in it. Thus the

a weapons expert and

times CIA 'unperson' may be quite plausible... Immediately

after the assassination, a distraught Underhill told

friends that a semi-autonomous CIA clique which had been

profiteering in narcotics and gun-running was implicated

in the assassination.

Several months later,

Undechill

was found dead of a bullet wound in the head; although

police decided it was self-inflicted, the circunstances

indicated otherwise."

Ine article, now on the newsstands, also retails a story

concerning a man presently in the Springfield, Mo., psyche

ward to the effect that CIA was in on the assassination.

I realize that you are no longer connected with the agency

any comment which you might make to me would be in

confidence. I am most interested in whether you have heard

similar rumors or can verify these stories or others. I have

heard and seen documented stories dealing with former CIA

employees who retired in the field only to go into lucrative

business relations within the countries of former assignment,

similar to the way certain Generals and Admirals. are absorbed,

into large defense industries... but nothing as wild as the

RAMPARTS disclosures dealing with illegal activities of payrolle

employees.

I appreciate greatly any help you might be able to give me

on the above.

As I am seldom at the above phone number it is

probably best to send any communications you would care to make

by letter.

With warm regards,

Toes: 1613305860

Thomas De Baggio
