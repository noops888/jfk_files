HUMBERTO LOPEZ, SR. Commented this morning that members

of Abdala placed the bomb on

the "Mereghan II" in Miami.

He said that Abdala receives information from someone

connected with the company which owns the boät.

The bomb

was placed on the boat with a delay action timing device

for the purpose of having the explosion go off outside the

United States. However, something went

wrong. LOPEZ said

that ORLANDO BOSCH heads "Accion Cubana". He

then explained

that in Mexico City there were 2 separate actions by 2 separate

grOups:

(1) The BOSCH Group tried to kill a Cuban newspaperman

representing

"prensa Latina".

(2) JOSE ANTONIO COLMENARES and members of Abdala

placed the bomb at the Cuban Embassy.

LOPEZ said that MAX

XLESNICK, publisher of "Replica"

is supporting ORLANDO BOSCH.

OPEZ expressed the opinion that

this is bad for LESNICK.

About 11:30 a.m. today, the writer talked with Mr.

LEONARDO VIOTA, Miami director of Abdala.

VIOTA advised

confidentially that Abdala and a group of friends had placed

the explosive.on the British ship here in Miami, but they

thaught that the device would explode in international waters.

VITA emphasized that something had gone wrong with the mech-

anism.

Also, he stated that he has in mind calling a

press conference with a small group of trusted newsmen, and

telling them that the terrorist activities will continue in

on that i the 4e

Hayana, the Front will sentence to death all Cubans who

collaborate in arranging this understanding or political

solution.

Finally, VIOTA stated that ithe conference, if

approved by the other members of the Front, would be

handled just like those held by ORLANDO BOSCH, when he was

the leader of Cuban Power.

At 5:00

p.m. today, the writer had a confidential

talk with JENARO

PEREZ, ex-photographer 1or Replica, who

is presently Nataped at a carora shop at lest flagler and

loth Avenue,

and with HUMBERTO LOPEZ, Sr." JENARO PEREZ,

who is a close friend of HUMBERTO LOPEZ, JR., indicated that

plans continue for a press conference by the Liberation Front

to advise that they will continue terrorist attacks in all

parts of the world, and to point out that all nations at

the next Foreign Ministers' meeting which take pro-Castro

attitudes will be the victims of attacks, just like the

castro government and its. embassies He also said that Fla

recently there was a talk between, members of the Front and

Movement

-BOSCH and GUTIERREZ that if

any activity carried out by the Front, there would be serious

problems between the two organizations. PEREZ stated that

soever. with Cuban Action. He also advised that the Front

is willing to kill, even within the U.S., those Cubans who

are involved in betraying the Cuban cause, i.e. those involved

in any gesture of understanding with the Castro government.

LOPEZ emphasized that his son said that even though they

have plenty of people in Mexico City, for every atack, members

of the Front have gone to Mexico to help in the attack.

JENARO PEREZ indicated that the man in charge of

propaganda for the Front is RUBEN DARIO, and during the

conversation he said that one of the principal men of action

1S HUMBERTO LOPEZ, JR., who has ample experience in military

matters, because he is a veteran of the U.S. Army. He also

stated that they are now setting up secret cells, independent

of each other, in various parts of the U.S. and Puerto Rico,

so that in case the "Feds" are able to capture one cell,

the others will have no problems.

During the long talk

concerning the Front, he said that the movement has

several young men who are American citizens and as such, can

move freely anywhere in the world. Finally, PEREZ said

that the Movement has enough funds to operate, although

he did not state where the funds come from.

At 9:30 a.m., the writer had a confidential talk

with HUMBERTO LOPEZ, SR. who advised that a communique sent

from outside the country advised that Abdala was ä screen

for a Communist organization called the National Liberation

Front of Cuba.

This communique stated that RUBEN DARIO

was an agent of Fidel Castro.

LOPEZ said that he is very

suspicious about the Communist leanings of RUBEN DARIO,

but he has no proof. He also said he has learned that the

communication making these charges

was written by ORLANDO

BOSCH, leader of Accion Cubana, based only on the fact

that he is jealous of the work being done by the Liberation

Front.

Finally, he said that the Front is trying to prove

that this document was sponsored by ORLANDO BOSCH, and if

they are able to prove this, BOSCH will be murdered by

the men of the Front.

At 9:30 a.m. today, Mr. RUBEN DARIO came to the

offices of WAB.

He is leader of Abdala and a member of

the propaganda section of the terrorist group "National

Liberation Front of Cuba".

DARIO requested a copy of the

AP cable in which newsman IKE FLORES announced an inter-

view with the leader of "Cuban Action." DARIO commented

privately that it was idiotic for ORLANDO BOSCH to have

given a personal interview to newsman FLORES, since if

FLORES were called by a Grand Jury, he would be obliged

to testify about the interview, and naturally, he would

give the name of ORLANDO BOSCH. DARIO said that in the

story, BOSCH tried to link himself with the Liberation

iront, but this is not true,

since the Front would never

make any pact with Cuban Action, because BOSCH will not

be careful, and at any moment he may be arrested again.

• At 8:30 p.m. today, the writer had a confidential

talk with HUMBERTO LOPEZ, SR., who advised that the leaders of

the Cuban Liberation Front had agreed not to carry out reprisals

against WOBA, since the company was not really a threat to the

plans of the

Front. However, they discussed the possibility

of a terrorist attack against Mr. EMILIO MILIAN, Program and

News Director of that radio station, since he was the only one

to blame for the attacks against the Front made by that radio

station:

LOPEZ pointed out that nothing would be done against

MILIAN immediately, and that he is opposed and will continue

to oppose this attack.

HUMBERTO LOPEZ also stated that there really was

an attack on the writer's life,

and that this attack had been

carried out by people connected with MAX LESNIK and ORLANDO

BOSCH, since the Cuban Action Movement is practically at war

with the National Liberation Front of Cuba,

and ORLANDO

BOsch feels that the writer is connected with or part of the

Front.

Finally, LOPEZ said that LESNIK is now saying that

the writer wants to kill him, and according to LOPEZ, this

seems very strange to him.
