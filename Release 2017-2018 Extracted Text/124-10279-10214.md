SECREN

The State Department information operator on

9/9/64, confirmed the listing of RICHARD H. DAVIS in the

February, 1964, Telephone Directory of the State Department

which listing reveals that RICHARD H. DAVIS is presently

Deputy Assistant Secretary af the bureau of turopean Attairs

LANGELLE stated that he knew PRISCILLAXPOST JOHNSON

and ROBERT W. GIBSON by face, but never associated with them"

in Russia. He recalls that he may have talked to GIBSON in

a veneral security orientation session before GIBSON reported

SHe explained that he had this security

-session with GIBSON because GIBSON's wife was quite attractive

and had departed Russia leaving GIBSON

a bachelor in Moscow.

LANGELLE thought that GIBSON might be a target for the

Russians in view of the fact his wife had left him a bachelor

because of marital troubles. LANGELLE does not recall that

GIBSON mentioned anything concerning SOCHUREK or any other

correspondents during the security orientation session

LANGELLE explained that he exercised no authority

over any Americans who were not employed at the United States

Embassy. He said that he could not order these people to do

or to refrain from doing anything.

He could only talk to

them informally at their own volition.

Therefore, he was

unable to call in SOCHUREK for an interview even if he had

desired to do so

u)

LANGELLE advised that he did not receive a reply

to his 8/14/59 letter to the Department of State and he

thought that if he had received a reply he would remember

He had no knowledge what, if any, action was taken by

the State Department upon receipt of his letter. He was

sure a copy of his letter reached CIA through the Security

Mr. LLEWELLYN E. THOMPSON, former Ambassador to

Russia and now Deputy Undersecretary of State for Political

Affairs, was interviewed on 8/25/64, by SAS MAURICE A. TAYLOR

and BRENT. Ambassador THOMPSON advised that either ED-FREERS

or RICHARD DAVIS was the Counselor at the United States

Embassy in Moscow and since he, THOMPSON, usually talked to

his Counselor, he may have told DAVIS about the Soviet

approach to SOCHUREK. Ambassador THOMPSON believed that
