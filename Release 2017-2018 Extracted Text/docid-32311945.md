Enclosed LIM has been classified "Confidential"

because it contains information from the above sources of the

FBI.

It is felt the unauthorized disclosure of information

attributed to these sources could possibly compromise them

and thus be injürious to the national defense.

The pretext telephone calls on 9/9/64 and 9/28/64

-were conducted by SA RONALd E. YOUNG to the Citizens!

Committee of Inquiry, 156 Fifth Avenue, NYC, under the

guisé of a person interested in LANE's defense of LEE HARVEY

OSWALD.

Two copies of this communication are being furnished

to the Dallas Division in view of their interest in this

matter.

Investigation continuing at New York.
