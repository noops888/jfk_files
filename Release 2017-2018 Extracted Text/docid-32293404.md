From the above it would appear that subject from

August 18 to October 31 was in Tampa only fourteen days,

it being further noted that JAMES C. LONGO and his brother,

SAM TRAFFICANTE, were the only individuals observed to enter

the Tampa residence, and according to TP 120-C this source

indicates subject had no visitors at his Tampa residence

during this period.
