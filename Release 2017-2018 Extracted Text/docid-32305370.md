RE: philadelphia airtel to Director, 7/13/62

Reairtel contains paragraph, page four, setting out

reason PH 614C-TE believes TONY (LNU), referred

to in airtel, 1s

from TrentonÂ®

last sentence.of

paragraph is not clear as to

meaning of informants statement.

Does the informant mean that

CHARLES COSTELLO told informant that be (COSTELLO) was once in

Trenton and

1 TONY told him the names of the streets that he was.

driving on of

that TONY was once in Trenton?

It is noted that COSTELLO lives in Trenton and the

other interpretation of informant's statement would mean TONY

was once in Trenton and not a resident of the area.

At present identity of TONY (INJ), with brother-in-law

JIMMY (INJ), who 1s involved in the laundry business unknown to

Newark,

LEAD

PHILADELPHIA, AT PHILADELPHIA, PA.

Wi11 determine from PH 614-C-TE true meaning of his

statement as set out above and if he has any other information

that would link TONY (LNU) with Trenton.
