MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM

SUBJECT

: John H. Waller

Inspector General

: Jack Anderson Reference to 28 November

1963 CIA Cable

1. The Operations Group of CI Staff has provided a copy

of the cable about which you inquired. A copy is attached at

Tab A. It is a dissemination of a report by a British journalist

stating that a man named Ruby was in Cuba in 1959, where he

visited an American gangster-gambler named "Santos, " who

was living luxurously in jail. This dissemination was based

on a 27 November 1963 cable from London, a copy of which is

attached at Tab B. A follow-up cable from London on

29 November commented on the source of the story, raising

a question as to his reliability. A copy is at Tab C. A more

detailed statement about the man is contained in a report

passed to the FBI on 12 December 1963, a copy of which is

at Tab D.

2. On 7 January 1964 the FBI provided CIA with a report

that Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in 1959; a copy is at Tab E.

On 30 January CIA provided additional information to the

Bureau on this subject; a copy is at lab F.

3. The following points of coincidence are probably of

interest to Senator Baker: Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in

1959, as stated in the report that gave rise to the present

query; the name "Santos' is also the given name of Trafficante,

although it is not clear that these are the same persons. While

there are reservations about the reliability of the source of

the report which gave rise to the present question, we are not

in a position at this time to evaluate it definitively. It is noted

that the description of "Santos" as living in luxury in a Cuban

prison is similar to a version also reported in a 16 May 1974

story in the Outlook Section of the Washington Post.

4. As you may know, an Agency task force has been

conducting an in-depth study of all information relating to

issues surrounding the Agency's support for the Warren

Commission investigation. This study has been underway

since early July and, because of the detailed nature of the

review, may require as much as another two months if it

is to be completed with the thoroughness that we believe

necessary.

furnished to the Iit on lecember 21, 1963, a letter which

had been lomarded to a iriend of his named dose Antonio

JuaD. Hr. Juan had received the letter from his son living

in Cuba.

In the letter received by Mr. Juan from his son

the statement was made, "it is known here that zubinstein

was here a little leas

than a year ago visiting a fir. Dranski,

owner of a shop dealing in tourist articles, located on

Prado Street between Animas and Trocadero, opposite the

Sevilla Biltmore."

The reference to Rubinstein appears to

refer to Jack I. Ruby who is presently in custody, Dallas,

Texas, on charges of shooting Lee Harvey Oswald.

For your intormation this Bureau's investigation

concerning Jack I. Ruby has developed no infomation that

Fuby has ever been in Cuba except on one occasion in 1959

when he visited there briefly on a vacation trip.. Fuby

himself readily adits to this trip but has denied any other

trips to Cuba or contacts with persons there.

It Is requested that, through available sources of

your Agency, you develop any information possible relating

to the above-quoted statement in an effort to resolve the

allegation that Jack I. Fuby has possibly visited Cuba since

1959 and has connections there.
