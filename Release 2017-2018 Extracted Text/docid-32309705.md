Rebulet November 4 last with which was transmitted a copy of

Miami airtel to the Bureau dated 10-22-53.

This latter requested intorma.

tion on lavana telephones B9-4450 and BO 791% called by wanna

CUADARLACA from Miami.

The files of this office reflect that B9-4450 is the unlisted

telephone in the apartment of NORMAN ROTTMAN, American gambler and manager

of the Sans Souci night club and gambling casino in Havana. A confidential

source in the Cuban Telephone Company advised that this phone is located

at Calle 34 No. 14, Apto

3, Miramar, Marianao, Havana, and that it is in

the name of OLCA CHAVIANO.

The latter is a mulatto dancer with whom

ROTHAN Lives.

Certa

Telephone No. BO 7979 is located at the Sans Souci night club.

In the report of SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, IX. dated & 21-53 at Miami

in instant case, information is set forth on Page 90 that NORMAN ROTHMAN

was a visitor at the home of CARLOS PRIO SOGARRAS in Miami on June 22, 1953.,

At

one

time one of the silent partners in the sana bouct was

EUTENIO FERNANDEZ PORTEGA, former Chief of the Secret Police here during a

part of the PRIO tegime and one of the persons most frequently mentioned

as planning revolutionary action against the BATISTA Government.

He was

forced to go into exile after March 10, 1952.

ROTHMAN, who is a PCI of this office, has at different times

indicated

that he was in touch with followers of BUFEMIO FERNANDEZ and on

one occasion more or less admitted that the Sans Souci was being used as a

mail drop and message center by various revolutionary elements.

More recently, ROTHAN has been most bitter about treatment of

him and his club by certain people within the BATISTA government and has

indicated his strong desire to see

this government overthrown.

Therefore,

it would appear to be entirely possible that the calls to the two Havana

numbers of holtiaN by lalariad may have had to do with some phase of the

revolutionary planning®
