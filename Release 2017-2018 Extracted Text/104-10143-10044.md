from me to the Legislative Counsel, concerning release of a

sanitized copy of the 1977 Task Force Report, commenting on

Book V of the Church Committee Final Report.

felt in the past more desirable to not make this available

to our two oversight committees, primarily because the sscI

is somewhat of

HSCA Report.

of CIA's performance in the investigation of the

of the 1977 Task Force Report have been sanitized, much of the

discussion should be meaningful to our oversight committees,

I am hesitant to say pass this

this on to the committees until management

knows what the bottom line is. Is there a
