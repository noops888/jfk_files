A copy of the report of SA WALlER Go JOHNSTON, dated

his home address, 184 Clarkson Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y. Will at

Brooklyn College ascertain if subject is enrolled as student at

*Will at the Local Board, covering subject's home

address, 184 Clarkson Avenue, review his Selective Service file

as March 25, 1932, at Manhattan, New York City, New York. Will
