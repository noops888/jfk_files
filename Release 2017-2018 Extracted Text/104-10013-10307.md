Eduardo del R1o, also known as "Rius," Mexican cortoonist for Politice,

Mexican Marziet sent monthly magazine, and Stempre, Mexican leftist magazine,

was scheduled to be a guest of the Cuban Government at the 2 January 1964

celebrations of the Cuban Revolution. However, del Rio did not receive

â€¢ Cuban visa. The Cuban Embassy in Mexico City had received a cable from

Habana advising of this, and which said that del Rio would be

notified

directly in a separate letter of the reasons for this refusal. ?

Source Comments

It is believed that the lack of the traditional exchange of Christmas

greetings between the Mexican Government and the Cuban Embassy was

the result of the resentment caused among Mexican officialdom by the

strong note dated 26 November 1963, received by the Mexican Ministry

of Foreign Relations from Raul Roa Garcia, Cuban Minister of Foreign

Relations, over the detention by Mexican authorities of Silvia Tirado

de Duran, Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, in

connection with the visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City

Harvey Oswald, alleged assassin of John F. Kennedy, former President

of the United States.

2.

It 18 believed that the Cuban Government's refusal to give Del Rio a

visa is also related to Roa's note and

the Cuban Government's desire to

avoid antagonizing the Mexican Government further.
