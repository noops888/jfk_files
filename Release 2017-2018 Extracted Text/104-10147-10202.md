OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL

Thursday - 6 July 1978

(Confidential - MMP) LIAISON Accompanied Scott

Breckinridge,

Special Coordinator for the House Select

Committee on

Assassinations, OLC, and Rodger Gabrielson,

to brief Thomas K. Latimer,

Staff Director, House

Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, on

the state of

play as between

the House Select Committee

on Assassinations

and the Agency. Mr. Latimer immediately understood that the

crux of the problem

lay in the House Select Committce on

Assassinations possible exposure of sensitive information

(Nosenko and/or Mexico operations) in open fora. He said

that he would brief Chairman Edward P. Boland (D. Md Shat

Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,

the latter might discuss the matter with Chairman

Louis

Ohio), House Select Committee on Assassinations.

He suggested

the best approach would be for the DCI to

raise the issues

we were concerned about with Chairman Stokes

and, then, it necessary with the President. The latter in

could register his concerns with Speaker of the House Thomas I.

O'Neill.

Mr. Latimer said that the House Permanent Select Committee

on Intelligence charter precluded the House Permanent Select

Committee on Intelligence from playing a significant role in

this matter.

2. (Confidential - DFM) LIAISON Received

a call from

Spencer Davis, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff,

who asked for

â€¢ the phone number of former Agency employee

Newton S. Miler, as one of the Committee staff members wanted

to intervicw him.

June, 0/PCS/LOC/DDO, subsequently called

in his absence, left a message that he call Davis.

M' Informed davis this was how we had handled his request and

he was satisfied.

I also explained to Davis the Agency's position regarding

retired Agency employee

who was Chief of Station

and upon retiring took a position as a consultant

to the Saudi Government. Our position is that as

retired, the Agency fias

no control over his activities other

through his secrecy agreement which he signed and which

remains in effect.

Davis also asked me if the same situation

was true for a former Chief of Station in
