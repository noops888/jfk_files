Subject studied Russian and other Fastern European languages. While in

Finland, he also taught English.

Source did not know what income Subject

had, but wondered how he could manage to make enough money from teaching

English to be able to afford a room costing $40.00 per month, a telephone

and riding lessons, plus the usual normal living expenses.

bo DE CASIRO returned to Sweden, penniless, in about 1958. On a

visit to Helsinki later that year he stated that he had not been able to

find a job in Sweden. During the course of his entire stay in Finland

visit from his aunt, who is also an Englishwoman.

C. Subject never expressed any political opinions, but his entire

behavior aroused unfavorable speculation as to why he was in Finland.

do In the summer of 1958 DE CASTRO was hired by Pan American World

Airways to work at the Helsinki Airport, but he was discharged for in-

competence. Subject also was given a job teaching English for the

Tampere (a city in Finland) Finnish-American Society, but lost this

position, too, because of incompetence.

So Please advise whether the information in paragraph 3 above may be

furnished to

mich is interested in Subject. We woul

also annreciate vour advisine whether you have received a separate inquiry

in this matter.
