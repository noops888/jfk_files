exiled in the United States; reported that

EFRAIN LORENZO CABRERA, a Venezuelan employee Of Ransa Air-

'lines, who resides in Miamiffhad requested MM 635-S to place

him in touch with some arms dealer who could supply some

supporters

of former Venezuelan President PEREZ JIMENEZ with

weapons. Consequently, on October 29, 1964, MM 635-s intro-

duced CABRERA to MARCOS DIAZ LANZ, who had previously dis-

closed to wu 635-S that he could supply weapons from outside

of the Miami area.

When MV 635-S introduced®

CABRERA to

DIAZ LANZ, the latter told CABRERA that his name was

GARCIA: L (The CIA source knew DIAZ LANZ aS PEDRO GARCIA.

CIA, in its memorandum of 11/4/64, stated that CIA had -

been able to identify GARCIA as MARCOS JOSE DIAZ LANZ.)

DIAZ, in the presence of MM 635-S, told CABRERA

he could

supply

weapons and CABRERA expressed interest in

naking a sizeable purchase, indicating that he wanted t

furnish them to some political followers of formei

Venezuelan President PEREZ JIMENEZ, who is now in prison

in Venezuela.

Informant said that during this meeting,

DIAZ expressed the opinion that if "LBJ" became President,

the United States would go communist and he remarked that

there existed some secret organizations, such as the

"Minutemen," who would fight to the end and that in his

opinion, there could be a military coup.

DIAZ mentioned

some place, not in Florida, where the "Minutemen" are

reportedly organized.

At no time, however, did DIAZ state

that he is a member of the "Minutemen" or that he had sold

arms to them. Also, DIAZ did not say that the "Minutemen"

an armed insurrection against the United States Govern-

He claimed,

however, that his brother, PEDRO, had

some

connections with groups of this sort but did not

specifically mention the "Minutemen."

Also, he did not

claim the existence of any "Minutemen" military camps in

Florida.

MM T-1.

was of the opinion that DIAZ probably had

subsequent meetings with CABRERA but informant does not

know what, if anything, transpired during these meetings sul

On November 3, 1964, Mr. JOE VIDAL, CIA/liaison,

Miami, telephonically inquired concerning background infor-

nation on MM 635-S, under his true name, and requestec

identity of the Cuban who had been arrested with him it

the mid-1950's.

was furnished with the name of MARCOS DIAZ LANZ and back-

ground intormation on informant, without disclosing his

relationship with this office.

It therefore appears that

CIA's source is undoubtedly EFRAIN LORENZO CABRERA, who is

known to this office but not regarded as being completely

reliable.

He has

been contacted concerning FALN activities

in Venezuela. He is a former chauffeur and bodyguard to

PEREZ JIMENEZ when the latter was exiled in Miami.

On November 5, 1964, Miami contacted RAY DUBOIS,

CIA, Covert, Miami, in order to interview CIA source pursuant

to Bureau instructions.

DUBOIS felt that interview of their

source by the FBI at this time would compromise that source

relative

to another facet of importancé to CIA, Miami. He

indicated that this additional facet related to an arms

transaction involving Venezuela. This office did not insist

upon interviewing their source in view of the vulnerable

position of MM 635-s, it being noted that only three indi-

viduals were present during the first conference between
