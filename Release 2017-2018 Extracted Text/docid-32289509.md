FROM

SUBJECT:

SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., aka.

DATE:

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

ReBulet 6/4/62 and TPlet 5/17/62.

The Tampa Office is most aware of the urgent need and

necessity to develop highly confidential source coverage on

subject and his associates and/or subordinates. TPlet of

5/17/62 did not intend to imply that we had stopped all efforts

for confidential source coverage re subject; our letter was to

inform Bureau concerning efforts for such coverage at subject's

residence.

Previous weekly airtels to Bureau have set out what

steps we have been taking and continue to take toward confidential

source coverage, all of which are directed toward subject and his

associates.

In view of information set out in TPlet 5/17/62 that

the problems encountered at subject's residence negate such

confidential coverage, the Tampa Office took immediate aggressive

action relative to authority received to survey the Dream Bar,

2801-03 Nebraska Avenue.

Fisurs of the Dream Bar were conducted

on May 29, 31, and June 1, 1962. This established that such

business place was not vacated at any time and that after the .

Bar closes for business and FANO TRAFFICANTE leaves, a cleanup

man stays on and remains in the building with all lights on.

In view of the fact, then, that entry with security

could not be obtained at the Dream Bar,

the Tampa Office has

now initiated the following steps with an aggressive, deter-

mined, imaginative approach to accomplish our greatest desires,

the installation of numerous highly confidential sources which

will place the Tampa Office in a position to know the activities

I. The JOE R. DIEZ residence is to be entered and misur.

installed in the immediate future.

JOE DIEZ is considered a

racket figure (Bureau authority).

2.

Survey of Ernesto's Bar and Package Store,

1901 - 12th

Avenue, is under way, and this location is where

numbers figures GINES RIVERO and

ERNESTO ALVAREZ operate, as

well as JOE R. DIEZ.

Just as soon as the sound-trained Agent

establishes what can be done, fisurs will be established for

entry and installation. (Bureau authority received to survey.).

3. Bureau authority has been requested to survey

Dixie Amusement Co.,

Inc., 702 West Columbus Drive, which is

operated by TOM DIECIDUE

and brother, FRANK DIECIDUE, the latter

considered a racket figure.

4. Bureau authority has been requested to survey the

Yellow House Bar, 15th Street and Ilth Avenue, which is known to

be a hangout for

AUGUSTINE PRIMO LAZZARA and NICK FURCI, racket

figures.

Relative to the above-identified targets, the following

steps and procedures

were initiated on June 1, 1962:

1.

JOE R. DIEZ

A fisur was to be established by the Agent assigned

the case so that entry could be accomplished with security and

the sound-trained Agent and another Agent might accomplish

installation.

JOE DIEZ and his wife are known to be residing.

in the residence, and whenever they leave the residence they

will be surveilled. Entry Agents will thereafter, with radio

equipment, traverse several hundred yards of open space in rural

area and gain entry to accomplish installation.

A plant area

secured approximately one-half mile from subject

residence.

2. ERNESTO'S BAR AND PACKAGE STORE

As of June 1, 1962, it was ascertained thus far

relative to this establishment that a pair on cable J is a

"burglar loop" from Ernesto's to Tampa Signal Company. Above

the area of the

cafe, however, there is a social club

of which

a security confidential source was president as of July, 1961.

Contact with this source was set for June 6, 1962, at which

time the feasibility of this source's assistance would be

determined concerning ingress to establishment.

This matter

is being aggressively followed so as to establish best approach

for entry, and

as soon as such is accomplished the best technical

installation to be made can be determined and appropriate FD-142

submitted.

DIXIE AMUSEMENT CO., INC.

EARL L. FEY, operator of E. & L. Sign Company, located

immediately adjacent to this establishment, has already been

contacted and is cooperative.

It is intended that his place.

of business will be used

as a blind for Agents in securing

subsequent entry into

Dixie Amusement Co.

It is sincerely anticipated that the Bureau will not

have to remind the Tampa Office that it does not have highly

confidential source coverage, and that the immediate future

will accomplish the above-cited installations, which are but

few to the many needed and desired by Agents working the CIP

in Tampa.
