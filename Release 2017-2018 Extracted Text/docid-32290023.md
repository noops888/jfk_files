On 2/11/63, the Bundeskriminalamt - (BKA - West German

federa Criminal Police) advised that according to information

from the Munich Criminal Police, SUSANNE FEUGER left Munich,

Germany, on 2/7/63, by Pan American Airways, en route to Frankfurt/

Main, Germany, where she had passage booked

on Pan American Flight

#59, departing Frankfurt/Main,

12:35 PM, February ?, 1963, to

arrive at Chicago, Illinois 11:20 PM, February 7, 1963.

The BKA also stated that it had been unable to develop

any further information regarding the activities or present

whereabouts of the subject himself.

The BKA has been informed that the subject reportedly

returned to Chicago on the afternoon of February 4, 1963.

The BKA

was also advised that it might discontinue further active investi

gation regarding the subject but was asked to provide any informa-

tion which its alerts to date may produce. If any such additional

data is received it will, of course, be reported but this case

is being RUC'd at this time.

On February 8, 1963, the U.S. Operations and Research

Detachment informed that it had been unable to intercept any

communications to FEUGER's mother noting that the location of her

current address made only chance coverage through the Munich

Post OfficE possible;
