ADMINISTRATIVE

Extra

copies of this report are being furnished to

the Bureau in view of the possibility of more extensive

dissemination.

ALLEY was interviewed at the Chicago Office on

March 28, 1961, along the authorized line of approach.

He

impressed

interviewing agents as being a shy and rather nervous

individual. This appearance is generally consistent with the

description of subject previously furnished by JOHN KENNETH

TURLEY and, therefore, it was not felt to have been brought

about entirely by the

interview.

ALLey in volunteering information regarding his

contacts with ABARCHALINE Said he "guessed" the FBI would be

interested in these meetings.

He definitely made light of

have been for more then purely social reasons. To further

illustrate this attitude on the part of ALLEY, when interviewing

agent attempted to have ALLEY be more specific regarding a

particular meeting and the line of discussion, he stated he

felt the matter had been fully discussed

and

toomuch was being

made of what were merely social meetings

ALLEY seemed to be sincere in his statement that

the interview.

It was also noted that ALLEY's memoryywith regard to

'places and

approximate dates of travel seemed most exceptional

in comparison with his recollection of details of the meetings

with ABARCHALINE.

Chicago feels that this interview was as intensive

as was warranted under the general line of approach and the

obvious attitude of ALLEY towaro

I the interview. It is believed

that with more time to think,

For the above reasons and since it is felt that
