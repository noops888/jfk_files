Bureau concurs mith your observation with respect

subjeet 's trips abroad.

Since past experience has shorn

that subject's trips primrily include areas where the FBI

nas begas Actache assignments, it is felt that any intensive

coverage of

subject's activities while abroad should be

bandled by

established source of

these Legats.

As you are avare, a memorandun summrtzing subject's

background and prior activities vas furnished Legat, Londol,

prior to subject's last trip abroad.

Legat,

London, was

Instructed to furnish this memorandum to the head of the

British Security Service for its use in affording extensive

coverage to the subject wing any subsequent visits to

England by the subjeet..

(S)

planned

surmisned those Legacs concerned together with a request

that through sources attemts be made to determine her

activities.

Accordingly, New, York should be alert for any intor-

mation indicating subject or her husband intend to travel

NY 105-42479

The subject continues her close association with

JAMES and ANN LEE of the

"China Daily News"

, and she and her

husband attended the annual celebration at the "China Daily

News"

as they have done in mst years.

on 5/4/67, NY 5225-s* was visited at his home by the subje

and her husband. The

subject said they were in the informant's

neighborhood and decided to visit the informant.

The visit was

social

in nature, and there was very little political discussion.

-(4)

Since this time, NY 5225-s# has been assigned by the

CPUSA to the Professional Section of the CPUSA. Because of this,

It is felt that it is unlikely that there will be any further

contact between the subject and NY 5225-5*. (U)

Subject has, in the past, lectured to groups of

Iranian students. Bin this regara, the NYo is exploring the

possibility of putting My fols in contact with the subject.

on 8/2/67, the subject attempted to contact LEO

HUBERMAN at the offices of "Monthly Review"

As pointed out in

relet,

the subject only contacts HUBERMAN just prior to or subsequent

to a trip abroad.

on 8/10/67, the subject attempted to contact IRA

GOLLOBIN. She said at

this time that she was trying to renew

her passport and wanted some legal advice.

It appears from the above that the subject is

contemplating another trip abroad.

The subject's recent activities conform to the

pattern of her activities over the course of this investigation.

Recommendations of the NYO

The NYO is constantly alert to the possibility of

developing the contacts of the subject as informants. However,

the subject's contacts are very limited. They are almost

exclusively individuals who are pro-Chinese Communist or at

least individuals with a long history of leftist activity.
