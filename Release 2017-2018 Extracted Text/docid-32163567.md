General RUDNICKI seems to have some personal

sentiment for KOSTERSKI due to the latter having helped

him considerably during his imprisonment and to this day

he takes a fatherly interest in KOSTURSKI's well being.

Although RUDNICKI's assessment of KOSTERSKI may be

noderated by personal feeling,

it is novertheless considered

to be a basically sound description of KOS TERSKI.

RUDNICKI describes KOSTERSKI as an essentially

He says KUSTERSKI

is a somewhat boisterous and emotional character who cannot

easily fit himself into society.

Ho is a person who mill

mentally unstable.
