Dear Mr. Hoover:

86 833

Thank you for your letter of February 21, 1964, in which you

advise that your Bureau is determining whether salvador Diaz Verson wife?

undergo a polygraph examination.

In connection with this matter, I have recently been wondering

whether there is any identity or relationship between Dr.

named by Verson as his source, and Horacio Duran Navarro,

the husband of Silvia, who had contact with Oswald when be visited the

Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

We note that sometimes your reports

2) refer to Verson's alleged source as Navarro and at other times as

3/4/104/

3)

The Commission has requested me

to ask that your Bureau and

any cooperating agency consider this possibility and

investigate it.

I am assuming that you are in possession of transla-

tions of the interrogation reports prepared by the

based upon their interviews of Silvia Duran,

her husband, and others

home of Silvia's brother-in-law.

AT TOT! ANOD

Thank

you for your continuing

cooperation in the work of

this Commission.
