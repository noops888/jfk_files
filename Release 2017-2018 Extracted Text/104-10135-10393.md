Nosenko during the period of his incarceration. Noyes

recalled that from time to time Nosenko had complained

about being drugged but he did not believe there was any

basis for these complaints.

Noyes recommended that Thomas Ryan of DDO/SE Division

and Paul Dillon, currently assigned to the Domestic Training

Station, be interviewed for further confirmation of the fact

that no drugs had ever been administered to Nosenko for

other than routine medical purposes.

(Since Mr. Ryan is

currently scheduled to be interviewed by the House Select

Committee

on Assassinations, he has not been interviewed

at this time; however, it is known that Mr. Ryan has intormec

jeorge Kalaris, Chief; SE Division, that he is certain that

no drugs

other than routine medication were ever administered

to Nosenko.)

The question of whether Nosenko has ever been administered

any drugs for interrogation purposes has been the subject of

previous

research by the Office of Security. Attached to this

report is

a memorandum dated 4 August 1975 reporting the

results of the Office of Security's previous research.

This

research, contined basically to a review of the logs

maintained

by the Security personnel

in charge of Nosenko's custody,

disclosed no evidence of the use of drugs during any of

Nosenko's

interrogations.
