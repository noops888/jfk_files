SCAFIDI has no alternative but to attend the meeting; that the

meeting will be on a Sunday and will be held at the La Rosa

Restaurant, Vineland, N.J., owned by JOSEPH PERELLA (subject

01 Bufile

for induction at the forthcoming induction meecing.)

On Saturday, 7/18/69, informant contacted IGNATIUS

DENARO, Underboss Philadelphia Family of ICN, for messages

to be delivered to JOSEPH SCAFIDI who source

intended to see

in person Bridgeton, N.J., 1/19/69. DENARO told source te

tell SCAPIDI,

It we do not meet this weekend I might send

something up

to him." Informant explained DENARO's comnents.

DENARO meant that if he meets with JOSEPH SCAFIDI in person

the forthcoming weekend, 1/25-26/69, then DENARO personally

will turnover to SCAFIDI SCAFIDI's proportionate share of

the profits of illegal gambling activity in which DENARO,

ANGELO BRUNO, SCAFIDI and others operate

as a partnership.

If this meeting does not take place the "something"

meaning

money and possibly records, will be delivered to JOSEPH

SCAFIDI by the source.

informant said that he would accordingly

contact IGNATIUS DENARO on Saturday morning, 1/25/69. If

DENARO gives him money or accounting of profits of numbers

activity to deliver to JOSEPH SCAFIDI then the induotion

ceremony probably will not take place weekend of 1/25-26/69.

Ir on the other hand, DENARO indicates he will see JOSEPH

SCAFIDI in person the ceremony will probably be held Sunday,

1/26/69.

Source on night of 1/18/69, telephonically contacted

JOSEPH SCAFIDI and advised him of the above and did not see

SCAFIDI in person 1/19/69.

The above is to alert Newark Division of the possibility

of this induction ceremony.

Philadelphia at the present time

cannot obtain any more exact information as to time but is

following this matter closely and will keep the Newark Division

informed of developments.
