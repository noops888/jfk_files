ADMINISTRATIVE

Individual cases are open in the Miami Office

on ROLANDO MASFERRER, JUSTO LUIS POZO, and WILLIAM JOHNSON,

and full details of the activities of these individuals are

reported in those files.

In view of the fact that there

are separate cases opened on the individuals, information in

instant report has been confined to that information dealing

with those matters pertaining to this specific occurrence.

It is noted that interview of JUSTO LUIS POZO DEL

PUERTO appears on SF 64 for POZO's main file (Miami 105-1872).

The original of the SF 64 is filed in that file. Sufficient

copies were made at the time of the recording of the original

interview to save duplication in the typing of instant report.
