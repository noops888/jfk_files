Shortly before Labor Day, 1956,

his "boss". wanted to see him at his office. PRANO did

not say who his boss was or why he wanted to see him.

Thereafter on the Thursday before Labor Day, 1956, he

to the Lilac Lodge on Wolf and Cermak Roads.

including

York

"taken for a ride".

now where seated tease te to been

uneasy, and he decided to give the appearance of "going

along" with any suggestions they would make. He said the

"boss" asked him how many jukeboxes he had, and POSS told

him and then was told by the boss, "We're going to make

you a lot of money with books and

slots."

He said in

order to stall them off he told them he

could not give

them a definite answer then as he was going to the lakes

for three days and for them to see

him upon his return

next Tuesday to discuss the matter further. He said that

he was not harmed on the ride and was returned to his

automobile.

Upon returning to Aurora, he immediately called

Sheriff HOWARD KELLETT and told him of his recent ride,

and asked advice as to how to cope with the situation.

Between them it was decided to tell the "musclemen" that

he had a silent partner who would not go for their deal

and that, therefore, it was all off.

At this point, Mr.

Iwas shown several photographs and he picked out the

photograph of SAM GIANCANA as closely resembling the

"boss" when he was taken on a ride.

He said PRANO

did return to his office and was advised as stated above.

He stated that after this he was visited by RALPH KELLY

of Elgin, Illinois, who told him he hated to 'do this but

it was an order that he,

get out of business.

Shortly thereafter CLARENCE LAMBERT, 75 South

Chestnut, Aurora, came to his home with a similar type

message.

stated he had made no effort to go out

of business and had no further trouble until several

weeks later when he began receiving anonymous phone calls.

stated that although he could not prove who the

caller was he felt sure it was ROCKY PRANO, as he recognizec

is voice. In these phone calls he was told they had

found out

that he did not have a silent partner, and that

if he did not go out of business they would break both of

his legs with

a baseball bat, and if he lived he would be

a cripple for life. One of

these threatening calls was

received by his wife after which she became hysterical

and it was necassary for him to send her to Florida for

three or four weeks to recuperate.
