their desire to improve the lot of the Russian people. He

has further stated, according to Wilmeth, that the bureaucrats

with a greater interest in their own personal welfare and

materialistic positions than in the furthering of communism

or in the welfare of the common people.

remaining in the United States and obtaining their PhD degrees

about six or seven years.

two weeks until the matter was ironed out.

job in Paris as he was a Soviet citizen. Mr. Palangian became

very discouraged and then attempted to return to Russia.

re-entry into the Soviet Union but the Soviet Government

could not. give him a re-entrance permit.

France of not being able to return to the Soviet Union where

he was a citizen and not being able to find employment in

Paris.

Morocco, which had been his original destination.

Through

the Moroccan Ambassador to Russia, he got a job translating

in the government service of Morocco.

very much. It was
