This man was introduced to Brand by Builio Rodriguez. Rober

Brand was nad to soo how irresponsible and indiscreot these fellows wers. Bran

them an appointment, but Brand didn't attend to 1t. Brand had become uneasy ao

the disguiss becauss, although Bo vas using a second hairpiece, i looked awful

bad, and many friends had warned grand trat the hairpiece looked a falo from a 1

afaro

They also said that the noustache looked too dark. Brand's conclusion ab

this is what follows:l'The disguise nas very good, but hairpieces don't last lo

in Cuba's climats. If one wears them daily,

as Brand did,

"hey ars not good fo

more than twelve or fiftsen days. 2) The disguiss was good a3 Long

as it made

a differont man,

but it was bad because it had too distinctivo featursa, that

that if the police radioad a description of a man with vory dark hair, vory da

moustachs, and a pair of sonehow unusual glasses, it is jurg enougn that Brand

going to be caught. It is Brand's opinion that it a man is to vear a disguiss

a long period of time,

this diszuise should not have distinctive Isatures. It

be difficuli to describe the man in diszuise. This is why from the very first

in September Brand kept zaking Jim to send Karl to Juda.

Brand

wanted

to be di

in a different way. inother thing about disguises: the person

always have enough materials at hard. In many occasiona the replacements for mo

took too long to arrive to Cuba. The last ten roustaches were

received in very
