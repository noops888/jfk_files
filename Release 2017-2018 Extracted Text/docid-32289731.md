GUS ALEX

Johnson stated that he is almost certain that Alex did not go

to Los Angeles with Marianne and is positive that he was not

in Palm Springs with his wife. It is noted that it is most

unusual for Alex to allow his

wife to travel alone and this

may indicate that he was not available for

travel with her

during that periodoof time.

A. C. Jawarek, Manager, Murray Hill Apartments, 4300

he has seen him for several weeks.

He stated that this is

not particularly unusual since he very frequently does not

see tenants from month to month. He stated that last week

he was in contact with Alex due to the fact that Alex renewed

his lease until April 30, 1960. He cannot remember whether

Mr. or Mrs. Alex paid the rent

for March and stated that it

was paid, as always, in cash.

Charlie Postl, owner, Postl's Health Club, 180

West Randolph, advised on April 27, 1959, that Alex

is a member

of his club and that he was in the club on April 24, 1959,

but that he does not recall whether Alex was in town during

the latter part of February or during any time in March. It

is noted that Postl is believed to be senile and is not

particularly cooperative.

He stated that there were no

records which he could check to determine whether Alex was,

in town during March, 1959.

CG 6272-C, who is a close personal friend of Alex,

was in Florida from

December, 1958, until April 8, 1959, and

therefore stated that he was in no position to furnish any

information concerning Alex's whereabouts in March.

Potential Criminal Informant Ray Longtree was

unable to furnish any information regarding Alex'. whereabouts

in March.

On March 18, 1959, Charles Christiansen, Sx.,

President, First Commercial Bank, made available

It is noted that Mr. Christiansen

and other officials of the bank have refusedl

be re-examined and the only reason they furnished them in

the first instance was due to the issuance of a subpoena

in connection with an investigation being conducted by Secret

Service.

It is noted that these companies are controlled

by Eddie Vogel, Chicago, top hoodlin and that investigation

at the companies to determine whether Alex was in town

on March 4, 1959, has not been conducted due

to the fact that

regardobrious Vorel would furnish no information in that

and that he would furnish details concerning con-

tact of him by Bureau Agents to Alex.

An informant, who has furnished reliable information

in the past, advised that he observed Alex at the Tradewinds

Restaurant on Rush Street, in Chicago, on the night of

March 23, 1959, but could furnish no information concerning

Alex'" whereabouts in early March or at any other time.

Information was received this week indicating that

possibly Alex was maintaining a second residence in the

Esplenade Apartments, 900 Lake Shore Drive, but extensive

investigation this week at that address and at the realty

company which manages the Esplenade Apartments, determined

that Alex has never lived there.

Contact has been made with the following individuals

at the following airlines who carry almost all travelers of.

this area to Europe.

This investigation did not determine

that Alex has flown, under his true name, from the Chicago

terminals of these companies during the past year.

It is

noted

that Alex may have used another name in traveling but

this is not believed likely due to the fact that his passport

carries his true name.
