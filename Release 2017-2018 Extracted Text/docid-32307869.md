AR-CONSPIRACY

Re San Diego airtel to Bureau 10/16/68.

Re airtel on page 8 contains information furnished

by SD 1064-C-TE pertaining to JIMMY FRATIANNO. Apparently

FRATIANNO has worked out a deal whereby he would plead

guilty in a state case and then testify in the case against

a co-defendant.

Since it is a violation of LN rules for a member

to testify in a case or aid law enforcement, San Diego is

requested to reconcile this action of FRATIANNO with the

CI when he is recontacted.
