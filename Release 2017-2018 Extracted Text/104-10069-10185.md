with ACSI representatives the following topics worthy of recording

were discussed.

Opa Locita Refugee Referral Procedures.

Maj.

Matlington made the point that in accordance with the

agrectents which had been reached between ACSI and

local procedures were to be agreed upon in

order that ACSI might obtain refugee referrals fron

Opa Locita which could be used as a basis upon which to

count OB collection operations.

Maj. Watlington under-

scored the point that ACSI had no interest or charter

to run other than OB collection operations.

"this connection it was pointed out that once Col. Kail

identified an individual whom he considered to be pri-

marily of ACSI interest, he could arrange for this indi

vidual to be referred to Lt. Col. Causes' covert unit.

At the same time Col. Kail would make arrangements to pass

to KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and to Station

JMWAVE a copy of the Opa Locka debriefing of the individual

who had been referred to ACSI.

Upon receipt of this in-

formation KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and at

Station JIVAVE would review the referral.

If this review

revealed that the individual was not of

operational

interest to JIWAVE and his primary access was not in fields

other than OB,

no objections would be expressed relative

to ACSI retention and full exploitation of the body.

Maj.

Vatlington expressed satisfaction with this proposal and

stated that he would be prepared

to discuss

it further

once he had an opportunity to

personally review the func

toning of the Opa Locka center.

Causes asked If we could clarify the current status of

our relationship with Cuesta.

As this name did not ring

a ball with any of the JIAVE representatives, Li. Col.

Causes was asked for further details.

This produced the

ntatonent that ACSI was interested in Cuesta land vanted

to uso him in an infiltration operation.

ACSI had allegedly

previously traced Cuesta with Station JAVE and had re-

coivod the reply that KUBARis had been in touch with the

Individual but had terminated nim because he was unreliable.

In view of this responge Lt.. Col. Causes wanted to know

whether we would recommend the reuse of Cuesta by ACSI.

Wo responded to this by stating that we would review our

files and would forward a written reply to Lt. Col. Causes

within the

It. Col. Causos stated that he felt that he had

Despite this, he had found that

Ordonez had disappeared from circulation; and, there-

foke, he assumed that we were debriefing this man.

Third Country Diplomats.

REUTENAN asked the

ACSI representatives whether they were currently in

Once this attitude was identified no further attempts were

made to persuade Lt. Col. Causes that our actions had

been taken in the best interests of the intelligenco

community.

Hardtine infiltration of ACSI Arento. A dis-

cuscion of those support

In this connection the point

was nado by ACSI that under optinum circumstancos they

would profer that jIWAVE assume responsibility. for the

agents in the liani area and then deliver them through

If this were not possible

ACS would reluctantly uccept infiltration of their agents

into any point in PBRUMEN.

Causes was toid in

very precise terns that JIwAVE would not undertare to

infiltrate any of his agents into Ravana.

On the other

hand,

of selected agents to a beach area in PBRULEN.

The point

was made that in this connection It. Col. Causes had to

understand that our maritime capabilities were linitod

of these assets for at least six weeks in advance.

The discussion of opera-

tiopal coordination revealed that ACSI was willing for

ILWAVE to coordinate locally those operational proposale

which might be received from Lt. Col. Causes.

then the operation could be referred to the Washington

headquarters of both ACSI and JUWAVE.

Maj. Watlington

stated that the forms for effecting coordination in ec-

cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon at

Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit

In Miami in the near future. In view of this Maj.

Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination

mechanism until these forms were on hand circa l July 1962.

W/T Assets.

The discussion of the use of W/T

foctlitiee in terms

of PBRUMEN operations revealed that

the Miami ACSI unit

did not have any W/T assets in

PORUMEN at this time.

On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes

was interested in establishing W/T assets in PBRUMEN.

view of Chis he asked if JWAVE would continue to assess,

polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought

wore suitable W/T candidates.

It was indicated that we

vere cortainly prepared to review all appropriate cases

and would render whatever support was required.

This then

reculted in a discussion of whether JMWAVE would be willing

to monitor ACSI W/T transmissions from PBRUMEN in those

instances where the W/T operator had not been assessed,

polycraphed or trained by KUBARk.

We indicated that we

would be clad to moniter such transmissions if we were

told in advance of the date, time

and frequencies on which

the broadcasts were to be nade.

this Chen led to a dis

cussion of whother JWAVE would be willing to tranonit

nossages for ACSt agouts.

we stated that

we would lavorably consider any requests for C/ trans-

missions providing that we knew the content of the nessage,

the identity of the agent who was to receive it, and the

egont's location and oquipment which he might be using.

It. Col. Causes statod that in view of this discussion

could anticipato

that he would be levying requirenents on

us in the near future for support in the W/T field.

Once this was acconolished, KUBARK

COLLIENT.

At the conclusiön of the above discussion arrange-

nonts wore made for lunch, but It.

Col. Causes chose not to partici-

nate in the luncheon session.

During the luncheon conversation

aj. Watlington indicated

that he did not believe that It. Col.

Causos would cooperate within the spirit of the DCID's.

As a result

no salod that JIVAVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time

as It. Col. Causes retired and could be replaced.

end of Saptember 1962.

At the end of the luncheon session ai-

tangononts wore made for JENTONS to take Maj. Watlington on a -

tour of Opa Locha.

Based on

this tour additional discussions

toro to be hold with Maj. Waclington particularly in regard to

the development of procedules for referral of agents to ACSI

from the Opa Locka flow.

OPA LOCKA.

Maj. Watlington and JENTONS subsequently

vent out to the interrogation center at Opa Locka.

Here they

had an interview with Col. Kail, the tenor of which was, on the

part of Maj. Watlington,

to assure himself that the ACSI repre-

sentative, Francast, vas having adequate access to operational

Col. Kail expressed his opinion that the assignment of

to fornal liaison with the ACSI representatives would do much to

elininate present difficulties and all present echoed this pious

AGREEMENT.

When JENTONS turned Maj. Watlington over to

Lt. Col. Causes after the meeting at Opa Locka,

the two ACSI

representatives said that they believed that,

for the time being,

Le would be better to

continue the system as at present, pending

JENIONS permanent arrival at the beginning of july 1962.

Col. Causes is obviously skeptical about the outcome, this was

agreed to as a stopgap measure.
