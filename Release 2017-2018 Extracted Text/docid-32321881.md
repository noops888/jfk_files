Title: JFK Records Collection Act of 1992 (The Act)

01/14/1997

Synopsis: Chicago is requested to send requested files to

Headquarters/JFK Task Force as soon as possible .

Details:

The FBI has been requested to identify all information

in FBI assassination records that the FBI believes is under court

seal.

The FBI must then identify which jurisdiction/judges have

these records under court seal. The records listed below are

maintained in your field office and require examination and

response to the Assassination Records Reveiw Board (ARRB). The

records will then be processed by the JFK Task Force for release

to Archives.

Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (JFKRCA) any materials considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original -

form. The JFKRCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in

full. Therefore, the files will not be returned to your field

office. Since the originals will be sent to NARA, copies of these

files should be made for record purposes prior to their shipment

to Headquarters. All files should be received at Headquarters no

later than C.O.B. 1-27-97.

If you have any questions,

62F HQ-1029205-3367

(202) 324-9535 Of LuAnn Wilkins (202) 324-9466).
