ENCLOSURES:

TO BUREAU

Original and one copy of a letterhead memorandum

characterizing informants utilized in this report.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Because of the volume of investigative material being

accumulated at Miami, the Miami office will now submit pending.

reports in this case.

Referenced Tampa report of 2/9/67 refers to the Miami

fisur of the subject making a telephone call from a public

telephone booth in Miami.

This telephone call was of a very

short duration and appeared to be local in nature, as the

subject made no unusual deposit of coin for

the call. The Miami

office feels that a review of the toll calls charged to this

telephone would be unnecessary at this time.

The Tampa report of 2/9/67 contained a lead to conduct

background investigation of one JOE HEGERMAN, Royal Poinciana

Avenue,

Miami Springs, Florida.

JOSEPH HEGEMAN, FBI #5073190,

was a former

PCI of the Miami and New Orleans office and a

former PC of

the Las Vegas and Los Angeles offices and was a

close

associate of CARLOS MARCELLO of New Orleans and almost

all national LCN figures.

He is known as a con man, check LA

artist, etc.

On 3/8/66, the Bureau instructed that no additional

efforts should be made to develop HEGEMAN as a source and

no

effort should be made to initiate interviews with him for

development purposes. In the spring of 1966, HEGEMAN was last

known to be in South America.

This Tampa report also contained a lead reset from

the 12/9/66 report regarding investigation concerning National

Airlines ticket #283,403,406. Information concerning this ticket

was reported by Miami airtel to Tampa of 12/6/66, page 2 of

the insert.

Miami telephone number 751-8148 was set forth in the

12/9/66 report and is the nonpublished

telephone number of

EMILY /CUCCIA,

Miami landlord of subject, which was previously

set forth by Miami airtel to Tampa of 12/16/66, 'page 5 of the

insert.
