6. One informant advised that Subject is a diabetic who

must use insulin.

7. Investigation has disclosed no information which would

Indicate that either Subject or any member of his family 1s other

than loyal to the United States. Considering this, in addition

to the protracted residence of Subject's mother in the United

States, It is believed that the Ilkellhood of adverse pressure

being put on Subject by his foreign connections is remote. It

is believed that Subject meets security criteria for the pro-

posed employment. It 18, therefore, recommended that:

A. Exception to Regulation 10-3 be granted.

B.

Subject be security approved for Contract

Type "A" employment, subject to polygraph.

C. Subject's alleged diabetic condition be

brought to the attention of the Medical Staff.
