FACTOR - Amendment

and Termination Request.

CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM

as

the LILMPTY Project)

THE KEACTOR EASE IN Nepted

1958 to provide financial and material support for

visual and photographic surveillance

operations

targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City. . In June 1972 the project supported five

agents and two basehouse surveillance sites.

2.

The

FACTOR. Project was

approved by the

ADDO

in

the

amount of $19,000 for FY

- 72 and

$20,000

for FY - 73.

Per

DIRECTOR 285255, dated

30 June

1972, the ADDU approved Amendment No. 1

to the

DEACTOR Project

in the

amount of $9,844

for FY

72 to provide for costs of agent

terminations.

3.: The decision to terminate

all agents and

facilities under

the

SKIU ACTOR ProTect

was based

a security review

the project activities

which indicated that

VWBLANKET principal knew

the basic details of

KMFACTOR operations,

including the target, the location of the surveillarse

sites, and probably the true names and former

cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.

4

The cost of terminating the agents under the

KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of

closing down the two basehouses under the project

was

$1,412.

The total amount charged to the KOFACTO?

Project in

FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over

the

approved authorization of $28,844. The overage

was. incurred in terminating

the

agents and

lacilities associated

with the

ACTOR lroicci

Although Amendment No. 1 to the

Moject was

approved in the amount of $9,844 to cover the

cost of terminating the agents in the

26 Ap. 73

project, the actual payments made by Mexico City

Station per the terms of each Memorandum of Oral

Commitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican

law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination

costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment

was requested.

Termination payments made to each

agent are as follows:

FACTOR - 2

•KDF ACTOR - 5

KOFACTOR - 6

KOFACTOR-.8

DFACTOR - 9

(Recruited 1956)

$8,160

2,830

1,568

The long tenure of three of the terminated

agents,

the relatively high monthly salary of

DFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the

termination payments in accordance with Mexican

law and

custom

the primary reasons that the

final agent termination costs amounted

to $15,573.

5.

All agent terminations

were accomplished

in an amicable manner.

No. visible security risks

were apparent at the

time of the

terminations

although any one, or all, of the

terminated agents

may at some

future date

decide to divulge to an

interested party

the details of the DIACTOR Project

operations.

AKI ACTOR - 2,

AMACTOR-5, and KDRACTOR-6

have worked in photo

surveillance operations

obviously

Station.

However,

FACTOR Project was

not concerned with

incompatible

operations or

targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station

relations with the Mexican Government in the event

of exposure of the prActoR project operations by a

terminated agent are within acceptable limits.

6.

It is requested that ther

DFACTOR Project

be amended to provide the sum of $7

', 246 for FY

72. to cover the costs of terminating five agents

and two basehouse surveillance sites under this

project.
