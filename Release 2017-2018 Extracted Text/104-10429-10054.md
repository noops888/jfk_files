SUBULCT: Flights from Mexico City to Havana on 22 November 1963

REFERENCE: 1.

What is the total CIA infornation on the two flights

from Mexico City to Havana?

2.

What was done at the time to develop further information

on this matter?

3. Can further information be acquired on this matter now?

FINDINGS:

1. The Mexico Station records confirm only one flight from Mexico City

to Havana on 22 November 1963. This was the regularly scheduled Cubana

Airlines flight. There were two reports of small aircraft flights (one

a twin engine flight to Mexico City connecting with Cubana for onward

transportation to Havana of a mysterious passenger; and the other a flight

allegedly from Dallas, Tijuana, and Mexico City to Havana with two "gang-

land'' type passengers.) Beyond the original reports (from sources of

undetermined reliability) there was nothing

in the Mexico Station records

to substantiate that these flights occurred.

2. Facts substantiated by Mexico Station records: On 22 November 1963

a Cubana Airlines plane from Havana arrived at the Mexico City International

airport at 1620 hours (Mexico City time) and departed on a return flight to

Havana between 1940 and 2035 hours (Mexico City time) the same day. It was

on the ground in Mexico City about 4 hours which would be considered normal

for servicing for a turnaround flight carrying passengers both ways. This

information was obtained from sensitive reliable sources in the process of

routine operating procedures on 22 November 1963.

3. Report not substantiated by Mexico Station records: On 30 November

1963 CIA Headquarters cabled Mexico City that a report had been received

that the 22 November 1963 Cubara departure had been delayed five hours from

1700 to 2200 hours awaiting an important passenger who arrived at the Mexico

City airport in a private twin motor aircraft at 2130 hours Mexico time.

Passenger transferred directly to Cubana plane without going through customs

or immigration and travelled in pilot's cabin to lavana.

21 This information

was passed to the Mexican officials on 2 December 1963 for investigation.

There is no record of a reply. We know from independent information in

paragraph two above that some parts of this report are in error. The Cubana

flight was not delayed for five hours. It had departed for lavana from Mexico

City between 1640 and 2035 hours which would be at least an hour before the

twin motor aircraft was alleged to have arrived in Mexico City. The source's

name is on the manifest as a passenger from Mexico City to lavana but the

time

supplied by him does not agree with other information considered reliable.

The Mexican Government assured the U.S. Amhassador that it was taking

steps to control travellers and closed the border with the U.S. for

several hours immediately after the assassination.

A flightoofaa

private aircraft such as this is possible but it is unlikely that such

unusual activity as this would have gone unnoticed by the Mexico Statior

team of observers who reported on Cubana Airlines flights. 4/

Report not substantiated by Mexico Station records: On 2 November

1964 the Hamburg Base reported that a source in Cuba claimed to have seen

an aircraft with Mexican markings discharge passengers at the Havana airport

at 1700 hours on 22 November 1963. The source reported that the two passen-

gers "were gangsters" and that "the plane had just come from Dallas, via

Tijuana (where it was forced to land because of engine trouble) and Mexico

City." 5/ This information was sent to the FBI on 23 December 1964 for

investigation. b/ The FBI responded on 31 December 1964 that Tijuana

would have been an unlikely place for a "forced landing" on a flight from

Dallas to Havana. Their office was making no further inquiries in the

absence of additional details from CIA.

They suggested that CIA conduct

an investigation in Tijuana.

7/ (Tijuana is almost the same distance from

Dallas flying West as Havana would be flying Southeast or Mexico City would

Tijuana area. The information was a year old when received and much too

details.

5. The SSC V report page 103 further complicates travel data by the

listing of the Cubana Airlines flight delay from "6 p.m. until 11 p.M."

The writers of this report were probably trying to transpose the departure

time to the equivalent of Eastern time.

December 1963 which is probably a mistaken reference to the cable which

is dated 30 November 1963. 2/ The Mexico Station file copy of this cable

carried the date of 1 December 1963 which is the date it was received. ?/
