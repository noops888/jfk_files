[ywAGNA-2 advised on 4 February that the name of the

CIA agent was "CONTE".

She said this was his last name.

are still waiting for V-l's letter,

sent to the Mexico City

box on 31 Jan 75, which contains further details.

2.

A review of LA/COG• files indicates that there are

no on-island agents named Conte (either-first name, patronymic •

or matronymic).

There are two former agents; however,

named

Conte: Luis CONTE Aguero (ANGORE-2), and Ramon CONTE Hernandez.

Conte

Hernandez (201-285171) was a brigade leader during the

Bay of Pigs landing.

He was one of nine men Fidel Castro

vowed never to release from prison.

AMGORE-2 (201-278130, 6 volumes) was for many years

one of the Agency's best anti-Castro prop

assets.

He was

terminated amicably in 1969.

He is now a U.S. citizen.

The

latest document in his 201 file,

dated 23 August 74, is a

disturbing FBI document, reporting

an allegation linking

AMGORE-2 to & threat against the President.

There was no

reporting on him for the previous four years; his current

whereabouts are not known.

It is impossible to say whether there is any connection

between the Conto of para l and either of the Contes mentioned

paras 2-3.
