9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad • Federal Sccurity Police

The principal functions of this security untt are to:

(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,

(2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both

the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forccs, and

(3) perform Investigations and arrests of primarily political

offenses. The anit's agents are largely poorly trained,

Insecure, and unreliable.

Their professional characteristics

are best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.

The position,

at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as

Director General of DFS 1s precarlous.

10. Politica

A Marxist antl-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in

Mexico, Politica is printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,

the same shop which prints La Voz de Mexico.

In addition to

the modest revenues derived from a circulation of 15,000

to 25,000.

Politica is financed by the Soviet Embassy, the

PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy. As an

tridication of the Mexican government's assessment of the

capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it

15 worthwhile noting

that Politica frequently experiences a

great degree of difficulty in printing

and circulating itself

due to the government's repressive efforts.

11. Movimlento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN)

Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,

today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual

interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the

the PPS, the PCM,

the CNC and the UGOCM.

The MLN's objective Is to gain leftist political represen-

tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists

its camp.

As a consequence of this objective, the mission

of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy

by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and

peasant masses.

MENORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Chief,, Foreign Intelligence

TDY to Mexico CIty

1. After taking a good look at LINNVOY and LITRAT, I would agree

with the persona I talked with in Moxico; they maintain that any well-

run tap operation should produce substantial intelligence information,

provided the targets are of intelligence Intorest, and provided aleo

there are people at the station who look for 1t aul are able to racog

nize 1t. The case of LITEAT is Interesting in this respects It has

been deprived of Ita most productive lined in favor of LIERVOX, and

yot 1te Intalligence production compares favorably wit that of the

othar productive tage, except LIENvor.

2. Mexico has people who can detect any little Item of Intel11-

gence significance.

the highlights of the previoua day's take every morning and marke

cortain items for action by atation case officers or reporta oilicero:

The reports officors work on copies of the tako at the came time.

3. There are several aspecte of LIENVOY that make it an excellent

operation and an outstanding producer of intelligence.

then in dotall when uy notes cot here fron the station, The principad

factors in the success of Lusivoy seem to be the following.

a. The ngreement made with top Maxican officialo, unlike

many auch agreements elsewbere, lo as mich in effect today as 1t

was at the atart:

the targeting le not based on personal politica;

sidered to be on loan from CIA.

the Russian from two LIFEAT lines on Soviet targets, and the Russian from

to the Station ready for 201 files.

* Exploitation o1 LIENVOY Information.

HMMW-11831 dated o August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was

not well informed on the say the Mexico Station exploita operational leade from

LIENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART has instructiona to alert

¿be Station immediately if a U.S. citizen or English apeaking person triea io

contact any of the target installations. This is done by a telephone call from

outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B. RIGGS inaide the Station.

Emergency meetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch).

RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a pre-arranged downtown

location and recoives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conversation.

The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible

for the target the person was trying to contact. Headquarters is notified by

cable as the action taken. Only in rare casea is information on a U,S, citizen

Other leade appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen. They

also are exploited by the Station case officer responsible for the target where

the lead appeare. For example, on l: Auguet 1903 Boris KAZANTSEV,

recently arrived Counsclor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target

in Mexico, called his wife at their residence.

The number was not liated but

was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the

number was the switchboard of the martment house where KAZANISEY and

several other families live. The reason the Station checled out this number

was to put unilateral coverage on it if possible; however, the switchboard was

boyond the Station's capability tohandle.

Maryknoll priest Felix McGOWAN contacted the Cuban Embassy on

38 July 1963, MEXI-5565 reported detaile of this contact. This cable was sent

to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Profe88or WEBB (fnu) of the University of Louidiana contacted Mexican

Communist Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marxist intel

Lectual and professor at the University of Mexica and arranged to meet with

him on 31 July 1963. MEXI-5568 ruported this contact to Headquarters for

dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Bartolo ({nu) contacied former Governor of Baja California, Braulio

MALDONADO Sandez on l6 July 1963 regarding the sale of Cuban pesos. MEXI-556%

reported this contact to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

5. Liaison

On 15 August 1963 Willard C. CURTIS met with LITENSOR to arrange

for a sensitive PBRUMEN case (MEXI-5789 reportad the details of thia meeting).

6. Security

There were no security incidents within the project during this month.

7. Technical

There were no technical probleins during this period.

8. Personnel

Orville HORSFALL's arrival is the only change in personnel since the

last report and he is handled as an independent agent by the Station, with no

LIENVOY personnel aware of his presence in Mexico. Robert B. RIGGs sees

HORSFALI daily to deliver and pick up tapes.

In both of these cases, there sem to have been departure from the

extreme caution with which the Mexico Station has alvays handled the LIENVOY

material. Admitting that the cables do not set out enough facte to enable us

to make a final Judgment, ve still feel a little uneady about this use of

LIENVOY material.

In the first case, the Station sent an agent to the suspect's

hotel, posing na a Cuban Embussy official to "trap" him into revealing his

intenttons.

The scheme, which was adnittedly clever, succeeded, but we vere

concerned about what would lave happened if the Cubane themselven had decided

to contact the individunl. Hould not the LIENVOY operation have been exposed

We crant that the Cubane and other bloc personnel in Merlio

City may suspect LINVOY exists, but they do not know 1t - yet. Incidentally,

we had no traces on the PEPRNER lavolved.

3. The second case involved the detection, spprehension and deportation

of a Cuban Is agent whose whereabouts were learned through LlENvOY.

we cannot really judge the possible riok to

to leedquarters

before nction was taken.

In general, arrests, deportation,

trapping, or other actlon agalnst security suspects should he approved by llead-

where in the opinion of the Chief of Station, the added tina

needed would seriously impair ODYOKE, socurity or the securlty of our operations.

The Mexico Station has always done this, and the coincidence of two recent cases

where It was. not done inspires us to mery you. Please let us know your views.

CONTINUATION OF

UIMMA-21845

On 5 Jine 1963 Douglas J. FEINGLASS, Siaff Agent, arrived in

Mexico to replace Howard G. SAFARANO, the Station translator for Russian

language conversations appcaring on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines. SAFARANO

departed PCS on 18 June thus freeing an Inside slot for use by an operations

officer.

FEINGLASS' usefulness io the Station is handicapped by his inability

to transcribe the Spanish portion of the reels from the Sovie coverage. This,

despite Headquarters assurance that he coul do these transcriptions.

However,

he has seitled into ourside living conditions with a minimum of difficulty.

For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY tap center is transcribing de

Spanish portion of the above take. There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes

numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS

was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanisi. The backlog is being

retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives. In addition to the Russian trans-

crotions, FEINGLASS also clips the iranscripts for individual dossiers thus

relieving the Siation Case Officer for Soviel opcrations of a clerical task.

After the arrival of HORSFALL. the Mexico Station will review requirements

for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of

FEINGLASS.

In early june to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested

full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines. In addition, Thomas G.

URQUHART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the

LIENVOY tap center do review the traffic on a current basis.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY information.

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided

details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data.

In nost all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance

informaiion when reservations were made. Confirmation of the travel is,

of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might

be U.S. citizens making contact with Sovier or Soviet Satellite Embassies for

political or other reasons. On 20 Muy 1963 an English speaker identifying

himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political

asylum for himself, his wife and seven children.

Subsequent investigation

revealed that he was also a protection case at the U.S, Embassy in Mexico.

Eupjare U.S, agencies were advised of Subjeer's coutact with the Soviet

5. Liaison.

During this reporting period there were no meetings between the

Chief of Station KUBARK and LiTENSOR; however, regular Contact was

maintained with LIELEGANT and LIERGO.

In addition to the PB Band reports passed to LITENSOR, the Station

also passed situation reports to him on the India-Red Chinese border war.

LITENSOR requested the Station to check a report which LITENSOR had re-

ceived that 22 boxcars of ammunition was being shipped into Mexico from the

Unitou States. (Sce MEXI 2085)

On 5 November 1962 Chief of Station met with LITENSOR at the

request of Ambassador MANN. LITENSOR had LITEMPO/2 sit in on the

Ambassador MANN preparod a memorandum based upon a Depart-

ment of State cable which The Amassador amer Chict of stationto readio

(nut not to leave with) LITENSOR. When Chief of Station told LITENSOR that

he was to read the telegram (which concerned GPIDEAL's statements and

position on Cuba) to him, LITENSOR asked if he could dictate what Chief of

Station read to him into his (new) dictaphone. This he did. Both LIl'ENSOR

and LITEMPO/2 were pleased with the strong, definite and concise position of

They were also graccful that Ambassador MANN had got permission

to give them this report.

I. Transmitted herewith, for purpuses of leadgunriers faniliarization,

1s a typical one day LIE:VOY product of the soviet lines.

(iate that the

station has additional LIFENT coverage on the personal lines ef colonel

Aleksandr.cor lyevich 3IDORUV and Svyatuclav Fedorovich KUzisESoV, and on the

office line of Vindinir Ivunovich SAiOKHIN).

2. Except for the weekend period, the Spanish langue ruscript

reuches the suviel case officer on the duy followin; tie actual trinocription

at the most usually uno days after the tranceription.

langue translater tranucribes the Rusolan language portions irredialely, md

this product rcaches the suviet case officer about un hour or to after receipt

of the Spanish reporting

Simultaneously, flinsy copies of the above have been

given to the reports officer and to other Interested Station sraisers. The

first copy 1s kept in a stallon chrono file, for purposes of perment record.

It lo annotated for LOHAR purposes.

3. The Soviet officer, Lucy A. Dilliniar, and other cificers, read the

product quickly for the Immedinte purpose of obtainin: exploitable ICIMPROVE

or other operational leads, and/ur roportable intelligence. Aiter this initial

the product is literally cut up, with each clippin, of significant

conversation sent lo COS and to various Station officers for dieir inforation

Whenever pertinent, the actual LIENVOY clip is sent to lead-

quarters, for information or action - or a surnary of the clip is sent to

Headquarters in dispatch form.

Each clip io eventually routed to the Station's

renistry where indexiny and filin; is completed.

4i The Station finds that this Soviet LIENVOY clippine program provides

the files on the individual soviet staffers with a iather sood Ficture of their

activitles and personality.

(These Individual flles are of ecurse au mented

Catesory station files recoive the clips pertainin;, to soviet commerinal

astiricles, propaganda actlvicles,

suviet contacts, etc.

Very often, a sincla

clipping may have to be copied to be sent to the files of several Individual

Suriets and/or to une or nure eaiegury files.

5. Unfortunately, the Station does not have sufficient personnel

to mialyze and collate periodically the LIENVOY and other station

product in the individual Soviet files for transmittal to lleadquarters for

Its inforation; or possibly more important, for eventual tranomitial to nother

Station where a Soviet from Mexico City 13 recasioned. Headquarters attention

is directed ainin to MEXI-9885 of 17 January 1962 and allied correspondence

re, arding the desirability of having a trained leadquarters TDYer work on these

terials at the Station.

Headguarters may now wish to reinventicate the

possibility of finding a qualified staffer for this TDY aculunment.

The Cuban efforts at propaganda in Mexico in watch the Cuban

Ambassador to Mexico conferred with Raul Rod, Cuban Foreign

Minister, and sugrested to him that Fidel Castro write a short

message to the Musican people in Siciupre On its ninth anniver

sary of publication (see HAINA 19399).

The negarive treatment to a Czech commercial representative

by Mexican Immigracion authorities (see HMMA 19158).

The refusal by the Pan American Institute of Geography and

History of the Organization of American States t0 permit Teresa

Proenza Proenza, Third Secretary and Cultural Attache at the

Cuban Embassy, to atrend the meeting held by i: (see HMM 0438).

The embarrassment caused by lie immoral bchavior of Mexican

female delegates to the Cuban 20 July celebration held in Havana

in 1901 according to Manuel Marcue Parinas of the periodical

Politica as told io Teresa Proenza Proenza.

D. Liaison

With the approach of the GPIDEAL visit to Mexico 2% June - 1 July,

liaison activities greatly increased. COS visited LITENSOR on 28 June.

LIENSOR assured that there would be no problems in the GPIDEAL visit

and the sufety of GPIDEAL was guaranteed and in the hands of LTTENSOR.

Ai chis meeting LITENSOR itdicated his annoyance with the Cubans. (See

NEXT 1253).

LIELEGANT turned over to the Chief of Station a list of persons who

were put under surveillance in connection with the GPIDEAL visit.

The list

also indicated those who were arrested. (See MEXIs 1241 and 1264).

At a meeting held on 28 May 1962, the Chief of Starion, LIELEGANT,

and LIENVOY/2 met with LIE.VVOY/1 and obrained his agreement to hire

LIEVVOY/14 ro work under LIENVOY/3 as a technical inspector in Telefonos

de Mexico.

The purpose in putting LIE.VVOX/14 in this capacity is to have a

man who would be more available to the LIENVOY Project and who "would see

What others might be rapping telephones" in Telefonos de Mexico. Further-

more, LIENVOY/1 agreed to see to it that LIENVOY/14 would have "the

range and authority" io do the work.

Putting LIENVOY/I# as a technical inspector within Telefonos, could

create problems for the LIFEAT Project. At the same time WILSTED is re-

studying the LIFEAT system, improving it, rightening up the security and

alerting the base houses so watch for any abnormal acrivity on present taps.

I: ias been understood by the LIENVOY case officer that this has been done

and it will be reported from time to time in future LIENVOY reports.

E. Security

For a report on security of the LIENVOY site for June 1962, see

peragraph 2 E of HMMA -19319 (RYBAT-1597) dared 10 July 1962.

As was stated at the end of chat paragraph, any surveillance or

security threat of the LIENVOY basehouse or personnel can eventually be

handled, should this be found necessary, by Chief of Starion in LITENSOR.

F. Technical

The floor in the LP was recently covered with a linoleum which has

aritain.
