SUBJECT

Plans of Cuban Exiles to Assassinate

Selected Cuban Government Leaders

1.

The following report was compiled from informa-

tion obtained by Agency officers from persons who were

parties to the actions described. Agency officers made

Clear to each of the sources/that the United States

Government would not, under ny circunstances, condone-

report,

interest in distributing and placing slot machines in

ganbling houses.

elements in the underworld, primarily through his partner

who is a former police officer from St. Louis and through

contacts still available to them in Cuba, and they have

Offered to assassinate Castro for $150, 000; 10 advance

funds were requested.. If the mission cannot be accom-

plished, or 11 the plan is unsuccessful, an anount not

to exceed $10,000 would be paid for the

travel and living

expenses of five men involved in the mission.

The Cuban

exile conmented that he believed he had been approached

with this plan because of his Lamily's wealth; he told
