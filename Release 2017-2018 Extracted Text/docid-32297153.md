GUTIERREZ is the so-called "bomb expert" of the MIRR.)

On April 21, 1965, MM I-2 advised that several

days previously, Bosch stated it was necessary to keep

alive among the

Cubang in exile the idea that Cuban liberation

1s essential, and that financial contributions had to be

obtained in whatever way it was possible to do so, whether

by robbing a bank, or killing someone, if necessary. BOSCH

claimed there are

many wealthy people

in the Miami area

who are not at all concerned about Cuba. He labeled them

as traitors.

BOSCH also claimed that his organization 1s planning

a big attack on Cuba, and that instead of dropping bombs or

sugar cane fields, the bombs would be dropped on oil

the bombs or the cannons in greater detail.
