was contacted

at his request and furnished the following information

to SA JOSEPH E. SCULLY:

said that he first became associated

with the

Second, National

Front of Escambray (Alpha 66) (SNFE)

while he was a student at Earlham College in Richmond,

Indiana.

He described himself at that time as idealistic

and with complete faith in the SNFE. After coming to

Washington, D.C., he became aware that although he was the

Washington, D.C.

representative of that organization he was

never fully taken into its confidence., He also attempted

to learn something of the organizations military plans

(Plan Omega) but all questions were answered in only general

vague terms.

was unable to citey specific

reasons but he began to doubt that money collected and

equipment obtained was put to the use for which it was

intended.

was, adaitional aisillusioned by the

capture of ELOY GUTIERREZ-HENOYO, Leader of the SNFE, and

his subsequent public confessions on television in Cuba where

he implicated other members of the organization.

also noted that shortly alter?:

.?MENOYO's apprehension

many Cubans in Cuba were arrested and

feels that

there may have been a connection between MENOYO's apprehension

and these arrests.

The above,

coupled with the general

questionable background of MENOYO with regard to his early

association with FIDEL CASTRO raised serious doubts concerning

MENOVO himself.

has developed a suspicion that

MENOYO may have

been a CASTRO man or at least motivated by

personal gain rather then by concern

sor the country of Cuba.

the definite impression that the

I suspicions concerning MENOYO

have also

been heightened by the fact that during her

stay in Washington, D.C.; MERCEDES MENOYO applied at the

Embassy of Czechoslovakia for renewal of her Cuban Passport

and was successful in receiving

The passport was sent to her at

residence.

Additionally,

noted that a

vast number of Cubans in

Washington,D.C. are suspicious

of and distrust MENOYO and the SNFE.

He feels that

his association with this organization has adversely Affected

his association with other members of the Cuban community

and that to a degree they distrust him because of his
