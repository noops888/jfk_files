Information Concerning ANTHONY DETOLVE

During the afternoon of 2/4/63, former State

Senatore FRED ROTI came in and conversed with MARCY concerning

the fact that ANTHONY DETOLVE is shooting off sparks and is

angered due to the fact that it was his understanding that

he was not only to be made Alderman but Ward Committeeman

of, the First Ward as well. ROTI and MARCY's conversation

continued as follows:

ROTI:

He says he has $50,000 that JOHN was supposed to

make him a judge and he (obs) him.

He says JOHN

(obs) up on five things... He says

• I can't get along

with him. He says I hate his (obs) guts and he hates

my guts.

He says it's never gonna work out.

MARCY:

Don't worry about it, you don't worry about nothin':

ROTI:

He says if he's gonna have his office here, I don't

want my office here.

MARCY:

I let him know.

. I told him, listen, there are

certain things

I ain't never gonna

tell you?

You" re

not supposed to know certain things. Now drop it

You were told that, I told

He says

right you don't,

I'm not your boss.

But if you don't

listen to me you're making a big mistake! Then he

changed his tune.

ROTI:

I think

who is real close tò him,

may be giving him ideas.

You know he's a nice

fellow all right, but he's pretty cute.

He says

I didn't want this, he wanted a judgeship.
