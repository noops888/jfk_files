I spent most of my time in Puerto Rico last weekend cruising

the

labyrinthian

suburbs of San Juan looking for Leopoldo Cainas

(in the southeast

suburb of Carolina) and Manuel Rodrigues

I found thaf. they have both since moved from the last addresses

There is no lead on Rodriques but, if necessary?

The people in the house he

Tived in were away for the weekend? but a

neighbor told me that

amanolino moved almost year ago and that the current residents

of his former home are the second family to have lived there

since

he left andaprobably. wouldn?/haven-even heard of Rodriques.

a former wealthy playboy type who had

pseudo-intelligence contact, freelancing. for various agencies: a

'hobby' activity he came to as a result of his social standina and

classy military background the was a Navy officer himself and his

uncle was top brass who had a shin named after him:

One of the

reasons l decided to check in with Godoy while in Puerto Rico vas

to confirm my impression abaht Cogswell and, also. to ask him if

he has since recalled the namo of the H.l. Hunt representative he

had previously told me he met in New York.

Godoy: for what it's worth, seems to be a member of Puerto Rico's

swinging social set.

He's head of the group division of New

Over a four-hour conversation

with Ray, l covered

a wide range

of specific details regarding

any possible knowledoe he migh

have had about even the remote links

wa'rhich

we're interested,

including Lobo, Lykes, Kail, Trafficante, training camps and

Castro assassination attempts.

Unfortunately, following the

Pay of Pigs, Ray's activities appear to have been

not too involved.:

in the operational level, concerning himself instead, from what

I can surmises

Ingarnering moral and financial support mostly

tin-Puerto Rico

Nevertheless there are a few nt the more sinificant pornts

developed from. Ray:

When Bay was interviewed by the Fel concerning the visit that

sylvia odio had from three men who said they were associated

with Ray's organizations JURE, Ray was not told that the men

claimed that association and he was not told that. Odio was

specifically introduced toa man named Leon oswald. He claims

that he was simply told that sylvia odio was claiming that

Lee Harvey Oswald once came to hier door and that the Fel-agent

wanted to know from him whether she was mentally stable.

Rays first contact with the "American Embassy Sin Havana was

when he was working underground for Castro befora the Revolution

That was in 1958 and it was with a man named Cadwell:

so, -our Impression of him

Tand his relationship with Veciana.

when i

as i mentioned to vous

showed Bay the Bishop sketch and

gave hima verbal description art didnt take him very rong to

study fandtell he he thought lt bore a very close resemblance

to the fellow who interviewed him when he first arrived in the:

United States.

That was in November 1960, In Tampa. Ray recalls

that the man sald he was with the government, but he doesn't

specifically remember that the nuy said ClA, but he thinks he-did.

What Ray recalls specifically was that the fellow didn't ask him

very much about the details of specific operations, contacis or

what was going on inside Cuba: Instead, he was more interested in

talking with Ray about his political philosophy.

Ray says he talked:

with him

for about two hours and then never saw him again.

Ray doesn't specifically recall.any front.operating.out of the

Pan

American Bank Building.but wonders whether or not RECE 8la.

comewhere in my files I have some background on RECE

and will

chock it, but off the top of my head

itwas Orlando Rosch's

organization.

Coincidentadly. when l mentioned Victor Paneque

to Ray. he said he knew

him

in the underground in Cuba Buf Tater

in Miami. Day found

that lanecuo had become very close to Rosch.

That may be significant since Paneque was

the co-founder of Surgiss

Ray feels that

a plan perhaps masterminded by

Howard Hunt (whose book

"Give Us This Day". he says is full

of "lies," the reason for many of which he does not understand,:

deliberately conspired to break up the MRP.

Lof resistance building.

That would bring collapse.from within

Ray. reasoned.

The first stage in the series of operations

involved 30 separate sabatano operations within the

week." The

second stage involved consecutive landings of small

querilla forces at various points of

the island's coast. Together

both staces would-resultin theiappearance of a massive and

coordinated attack that was too big to resist. The problem,
