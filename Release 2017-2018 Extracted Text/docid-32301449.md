(00:NEW YORK)

"THE CRIMINAL COMMISSION, ET AI; AR-CONSPIRACY":

Re Bureau letter dated 1/28/63, captioned

Investigation in this case was conducted

to determine if GUS

SOBELLA is a member of "La

Cosa Nostra."

A possibility that SOBELLA was a member

of "Ia Cosa Nostra" was based on information furnished

by NY 1894-C, who in January, 1958, advised of the

existence of a criminal conspiracy. In describing one

of the "crews" in this conspiracy, which/waWlocated

on the lower east side of New York City, he mentioned

the name of GUS SOBELLA, among others.

GUS SOBELLA,

the informant stated, was part of the original "crew"

formed by

• the notorious LUCKY LUCIANO.

The informant

said that SOBELLA had no particular position although

he retained a certain amount of respect since he was

close to LUCIANO in the old days.
