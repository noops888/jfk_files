Corollary objectives which are

to be fulfilled through the une of the LIINPTY Installations and personnel

are as follow's :

1) To provião operational information pertaining to the dally notivities

and movemente of LINTRICK personnel, particularly those individuale of

3)

To provide operational support and other protective servicen to Station

personnel and operations as may be deemed necessary.

Bo

The above objectives are to be fulfiled through the use of the LintisD,

LILYRIC, and LICATIA fixed Installations, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the

services of contract agente Raymond H, GERENDE and Oliver 0. SCANTLINO. These

objoctives are in consonance with and represent partial fulfillment of the

following sections of the current Related Mission Directive as approved for

Mexico City Station!

Throughout the perlod under revien, Project LIPTY continued to contribute

directly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station and Headquarters'

5) PHOTO COVERADE - GENERAL

During the f month perlod frou 1 November to 1 August 196k, the LTEMPTY

project produced approximately T70 rolla of operational still photographe,

of vulch 595 rolls were direatly concerned with the LiniCK target.

This

coverage, linked with the dally lose kopt by the basehouse keepere of the

activities of the WRICK personnel, watle contimully contributing to.

the Station'e regular CE offort, has been particularly effective during

crite times much as the OPFLOOR investigations. wallo the photographie

coverase is used almost oxclusively for station operations in the lINERICk

arce, LIPTY has also provided direct support to other operation such ae

providing verification of a double agent'a visite to the LIMRICK

Installation.

6) Oliver de SCANNO

Durinis the parlod 1 December 1963 through 30 August 1964, Long-term Station

asset,. Oliver Q. SCANTLINO (pa) contimed as the cutout

to the LINKIED

basebouse, and made his regular contribution as the alternate contact of

LICASA-1 in this senaltive LAURICLE operation. SCANILINO also performad

mmerous pretext Investigations, serviced accommodation addresses, and

propared formal casing reporte.

Of particular significance were

SCANTLINO 'a regular checks of the accoumodation address used in the

02.:

sensitive-LE uLssloperation,

the thorough Investigation of a former

'(See also Section VI, PLANS, for SCANTLING'a future

operational assigment).

7)

Raymond E. OBRENDE

During the perfod under review, GERENDE continued in his assignment se

the Station cutout to the LILYRIC and LICALIA basehouses, the LIEVIRAP

unit and as the processor of the raw photographic take, and with the

ascistance of LIDOTT-10,

continued to provide and service the majority

of the accommodation addresses used by the Station.

The contributiona

nade principally by GERENDE (and to a limited extent by BCANTLINO) to the

sensitive AMROD operation can accurately be described an unique and

ossential to the success of that operation. Although this activity 1e

necessarily & Headquarters directed effort, the local contributions of

OBRANDE and SCANITINO are integral ingredients of that operation.

D. 'It will ba noted from the above samples of LIEMPTY contributions to the

station's progress tovards fulfillment of the pertinent sections of the

Related Mission Directive, that notwithstanding their demonstrable value

and importance, these, contributions actually represent only a portion of

the setivity directed towarde the fulfillment of each objective. Therefore,

any precise measurement of project progresa la procluded.

However, based

on the performance and overall contributions of the LIEUPTY project during

the past project year, the Station concludes that thie project 10 essential

to the fulfillment of the Related Mission Directive and must be continued

during the fortheouing project year.

A)

On 2% Saptember 1964, the Station was Informed by Hondquarters that a

LIVITY project photogruph uhich was one of several supplied to the Warren

Cormission In November 1903, would be publlahed in that Commission's formal

overt report: since LINERICK officiale vould undoubtedly be able to

recognise the individual in. the photographe in a visitor to their

Installation and with a vler towirds the atterdant possible security problema,

the IMITED, LILYRIC, aNd LICALLA operations wore suspended on 26 and 27

September and all photographie and other compromising equipmant as evacuated

troa these basehouses,: ALl basehouse personnel were briefed in general on the

situation and specifically on how to cope with any possiblo Inquiries frou

Covernment offlolale or 'LINERICK inaplred or prompted newman.

Craylete

Raymond H, GERINDE and Oliver d. SCANTLINO, Upon riceipt by the Station of a

copy of the photograph, It was determined that the LIMITED banehouse had

providod the photograph in question..

This conalderation,

linked with further

analyala of the limitations upon any counteractions avallable to LISTICK

officials, alloved the Station to re notivate the LILYRIC and LICALLA bases

on a phased basia in early October 1964. However, because LINTTED vad the

originator of the to be published photograph and due to the ago and deterio

ratoil condition of the LTYaD property (oned by KUBARK), Station Mexico

city did not renctivate INMITED and prosentod to Headquartors a plan for the

demolition of the present INMITED structure vith recommendations for the

construction of a new building complex. (See MEXI 1307 dated 20 Octobar 1964

for additional dotalle).

B)

In accoriance with paragraph 2 of MW-12297 dated 28 January 1964, the

value and productivity of all assete under Project LIEMPTY was closely

reviered againat the necessary security and efficiency roquirements.

It was

deterained that LIEMPTY-I2 and LIEMPTY-8 could be terminated without causing

Intolerable gapa in operational coverage or an unacceptable decrease in

efficiency,

Both LIENTTY-J2 and IEMPTY-8 were terminated on 30 June 1964,

at the sane time, lu leaping with the ODYOKE economy progran, a further effort

as made to roduce the costs of this project by placing LIENPTY-19 on an

hourly rate for work pertormed for the Station.
