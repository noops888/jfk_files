(4) If so, did the FBI desire that HILL come to

Miami for the purpose of introducing STEWART

and to fill

in any further details that may be desired.

(5) CRASSWELLER, on behalf of the British govern-

ment, would like to be kept advised of any further developments

which indicate that the anti-CASTRO movement is utilizing or

operating from any British islands.

Mr. CRASSWELLER said that the British Special

Services at Nassau has in its possession a letter dated

11/10/58, signed by Mr. CHARLES E. WYATT, U. S. Customs,

Miami,

Florida, certifying that STEWART had been of assistance

to the U. S. Government.

activities.

Offer of cooperation. He was informed that since STEWART 5)

has contact with U. S. Customs, Miami, it was not deemed

necessary for this office to also establish contact with

it is felt that U. S. Customs will advise concerning any

pertinent information furnished them by STEWART. CRASSWELLER

said that so far as he knew STEWART had not furnished infor-

nation concerning the lE(shauderdale meeting to U. S.

Customs,

Mlami.) Mr. CRASSWELLER was also informed that this office
