JFK,

On 10-4-55 DL-18-S and DI-19-S advised SA JAMES P

HOSTY, Jr.

that AUGUSTIN ESTRADA, Chairman of the State Board of the CP

in Texas, had indicated that he was soon to attend a National

He requested these

informants to obtain airlines schedules from Dallas, Texas, to

Miami, Florida, and indicated that he was leaving Dallas:

sometime after 10-12-55.(4/(4)

Subsequently, on 10-18-55, ESTRADA mentioned a proposed trip

to DL-2-S and was overheard to state that he possessed a $150.00

He indicated at that time that he had reservations for

an out-of-town trip and had already obtained his ticket for

this trip.

ESTRADA mentioned that he had saved $33.00 by taking

an Air Coach. DL-2-S also told SA EDWIN D. KUYKENDALL that

ESTRADA might go to New York City X/FU

DL-6-S was contacted by SA W. HARLAN BROWN and indicated that

ESTRADA would soon go out of town on some kind of Cp meeting.

This informant, who is a close personal friend of ESTRADA,

was registe

to determine ESTRADA's destination on his proposed

trip.

The airlines' schedules were checked by the aforementioned

Special Agents for several days in an attempt to identify the

reservation made by ESTRADA. It was determined that $33.00

could be saved by taking a coach flight to Miami rather than

one a resence

making a first-class flight, in that the difference between

and Air Coach round trip from Dallas to Miami 1s

$33.00.

A surveillance by the above-named agents on 10-20-55 proved

unproductive; however, on that date it was determined that one

JUAN HERNANDEZ had made reservations on Delta-C&S Airlines,

Flight #42,

on 10-21-55.

Also, on 10-21-55 DL-6-S advised

SA

W. HARLAN

BROWN that ESTRADA was departing for Miami on that

date via air.
