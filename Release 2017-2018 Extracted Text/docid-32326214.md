PRACE LANEOURA, RORMATION CONCERNING

(ACCOUNTING AND FRAUD SECTION)

(00:LA)

Rerep SA Grant C. Earl dated 6/12/62 at Los Angeles.

The Bureau does not agree with the observations of the

Los Angeles Office set forth on the cover pages of rerep concern-

ing the interviews with Dave Pick, Joseph Sternbach, John B.

Stevenson and Charles K. Hackler.

It is noted that the original source of inforation

in this case is LA 4350-C.. This source indicated that Joseph

Sternbach, & CrA, has been Matula's accountant and that the source

knew for &

fact Sternbach dislikes Matula very much and would

possibly be of assistance in an Investigation of Matula. Source

described Sternbach as a "big crook."

With reference to Stevenson, LA 4350-C described him

as a former West Coast attorney for the Teamsters Union who

is presently semi-retired.

The source further indicated that

Stevenson's office in Los

Angeles is run by attorney Charles K.

Hackler, whom Hoffa does not respect. Among other things, the

source

reported that Stevenson holds approximately 80 per

cont

of Matula's cash and that Stevenson has a boat in Honolulu, where

it is suspected that currency may be hidden.

Rerep reflects that Stevenson may presently reside

in Playa del Rey.

Concerning Dave Pick, this same source stated that

Matula has been "shaking down"

the rubbish dealers in Los Angeles

RE: JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA

FRANK J. MATULA, JR

for years and that a number of years ago Pick, a Beverly Mills

attorney, was involved with latula in these shakedowns.

The

source added that & great deal of money Matula received went

through the hands of Pick.

The source

indicated that Pick

and Matula are no longer associated with each other and Pick is

an individual who would have

a great deal of information concerning

Matula's activities.'

In order that this investigation will completely

resolve all of the information received from LA 4350-C, the

Bureau feels that Pick, Sternbach, Stevenson and Hackler must

be interviewed.

It may well be that these individuals will claim

attorney-client privilege; however, until actual contact is

made with these

individuals, this appears to be merely an

assumption.. In view of this the Bureau desires that these

individuals be immediately interviewed in detail for all informa-

tion they may be able to furnish concerning Matula's activities

and the information furnished by LA 4350-C.

Extreme

caution

should be used in these interviews in order that the original

source will not be disclosed.

These interviews should be handled

by two mature, experienced Special Agents.

In connection with the information developed in this

investigation concerning possible income tax violation, the Los

Angeles Office is instructed to immediately incorporate this

information into a letterhead memorandum suitable for dissemination

to the Criminal Division and Internal Revenue Service.

(IRS)

The identity of all confidential sources should be protected;

however, T

symbols should not be utilized in the letterhead

memorandum.

Five copies of this letterhead memorandum should be

forwarded to the Bureau in order that dissemination can be made

to the Criminal Division and IRS headquarters in Washington, D. C.

A copy of the letterhead memorandum should also be furnished

IRS in Los Angeles.

During your next contact with Department attorney

Charles %. Smith, you should inform him that the Bureau is also

disseminating information concerning possible violation of income

laws to IRS in Los Angeles and Washington, D. C.

tax

The investigation outlined herein is to be handled

immediately and report submitted reflecting completion of this

investigation within 10 days of receipt of this communication.
