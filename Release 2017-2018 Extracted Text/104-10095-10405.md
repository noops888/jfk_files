SUBJECT: Summary of the Meeting with William Miller, Staff

Director, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,

re Foreign Liaison

1.. During the meeting today with Bill Miller with Messrs. Knoche,

Wells, Waller and Cary in attendance, Miller tried to elaborate on the

interest and concern of the Committee which prompted Chairman Daniel

Inouye's letter of ll November with regard to activities of foreign

intelligence organizations in the United States with whom we have liaison

contacts. Miller touched on what he referred to as "parity in operations"

--implicit understandings or at least results in parity between our

intelligence operations and those of foreign governments.

2. The question of the guid pro quo, that is, an understanding

with a foreign intelligence service that the U.S. would be permitted to

conduct intelligence operations within the country if they were given

comparable. opportunities. in the U.S.

3. The question of support of foreign governments and what this

might entail -- in this connection Miller mentioned Senator Gary Hart's

(D.. Colo.) interest and concern in the overall impact of the

program

Relationships with

etc., were touched on in this

Context and with respect to the latter organization, Miller expressed concern

about the possible long-range consequences of our (that is, the U.S.) providing

early training for foreign intelligence officers who may subsequently wind

up in operations against the U.S. or activities in the U.S. In this connection,

Miller said he would be interested in what Mr. Knoche referred to as the

constraints on our training of the se individuals.

4. In the areas of penetration of foreign intelligence services,

the question arose as to why if we can penetrate a foreign intelligence

service, we can't learn what that foreign service has in mind as far as

plans for activities within the U.S. are concerned. Mr. Wells pointed

out that we had never targeted against American sections of foreign

intelligence services on the basis that their activities within the U.S.

were not within our overall charter. Miller said the Committee would

be interested in some discussion about possible future capabilities in

this regard. It was agreed that Mr. Wells, with the assistance of the IG,

would prepare a rough outline or paper on a presentation which would

originally be given to the Chairman and Vice Chairman which we would

review with Miller before any meetings with even the leadership or the

Committee are scheduled. Once that has been run by Miller it could

then be fleshed out to the leadership and ultimately to the Committee.

5. As Miller was leaving, I told him I would be meeting with

â€¢ Richard Sprague, Acting Director, House Select Committee on Assassinations,

this afternoon. I told him while I was not prying into the Committee's

business, I was hopeful that the Assassinations Committee would be in

touch with the Select Committee. I said we were particularly concerned

about establishing firm security procedures with the Assassinations

Committee. Miller said they had been contacted by the Assassinations

Committee for access to their records and Miller had indicated to them

that they would be willing to provide access to their records so long as

the Assassinations Committee agreed to abide by the disclosure provisions

of S. Res. 400. To date the Assassinations Committee has not responded

to that offer.

6.

I also mentioned to Miller that the Office of Security was issuing

new Agency badges and tightening up on Headquarters security procedures

ant since we are having a number of congressional staff people from

vartous committees coming into the building, we propose to modify the

badging procedures previously used with the Select Committee staffers

i to the extent that we would like to have prior notification from staff

personnel of their visits to Headquarters before badges are issued. Miller

saig this would pose no problems for them.
