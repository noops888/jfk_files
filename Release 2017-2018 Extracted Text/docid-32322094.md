Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in

full.

Therefore, the serials will not be returned to Chicago.

Since the originals will be sent to the NARA, copies of

the serials should be made for record purposes prior to shipment

to FBIHQ.

The serials should be received at FBIHQ no later than

C.0.B. 07/06/98.

Please ship the following serials to FBIHQ, JFK Task.
