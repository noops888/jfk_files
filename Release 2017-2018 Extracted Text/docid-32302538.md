Since the latter part of May, 1961, KELLY MANNARINO, his wife

and two daughters, have been

residing regularly at his cottage

on RD #3, Old Leechburg Road, near Leechburg, Pa. With very few

exceptions, „

their visitors have been mainly family groups for

"cook-outs.

Other than occasionally walking his dogs, KELLY

does very little and merely sits in the yard sunbathing. . There

definitely have not been any "meetings" on a large scale basis,

meaning three or more male visitors at any one time.

does go to the Bonfire Restaurant frequently and may be meeting

his friends there.

The restaurant is only about à mile from the

cottage on Route 58, and is believed to be owned by SAM MANNARINO,

who also is frequently present there.

on 6/7/61 PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH:

The basement room of SAM MANNARINO's Bonfire Restaurant, near

Leechburg, Pa., is wholeheartedly believed to be a meeting

place for

the MANNARINOs and their associates. It has been fixed

up with a table and chairs, and both MANNARINO brothers have been

observed taking male associates down to that room for various

periods of time.
