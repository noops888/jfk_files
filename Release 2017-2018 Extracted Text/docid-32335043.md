FAIR PLAY FOR CUEA COMMITTEE

(FPCO)

have not indioated any mass reversal of past pro-Castro

Cuban sympathies.

They should, therefore, continue to be

considered potentlally dangerous to the internal pecurity of

the United States

unts) such time as positive intormation 1s

developed indicating to the contrary.onu

Recipents should also be alert for any continued

activity on the part of individual FPCC chapters and/or

continued activity of DPCO leaders and supporters under a new

organizational affiliation. Ein this regard it is noted

WF: 1282-S has pointed out that the disbanding of the national

PPCC would not

affect the Comnittec for Iatin-American

UnderstandIng

(CLAU) since this group no longer maintains

its atfillation with FPCC In New York and is an independent

organization.

The Bureau should be kept appropriately advised

in form suitable for dissomination of any such activity. (gJ(

NOTE:

Buairtel 12/18/63 instrueted recipients to immediately

review files concerning FPCC to insure that all local and national

leaders are included on SI and other individuals sufficiently

active in FPCC and related matters are also on SI or Reserve Index

where warranted.

Field was also instructed to be alert to

2cze dar pro-Castro propagandists and apologists such as

Lyle Stuart,

Waldo Frank and others whose organizational

activities did not qualify them for SI but whose writings,

publications,

etc., were sufficiently inflammatory to so warrant

The field was instructed to review these cases in line with

events following assassination of President Kennedy and consider

future action, if warranted.

Bureau is to be advised as to

results of this review.
