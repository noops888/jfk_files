WEEKLY SUMMARY

WILLIAM KENNEY, Departmental Attorney, advised he had

been informed by IRWIN POTTS that the Miami Herald newspaper is

presently planning to conduct its own investigation to attempt

to prove there is corruption among local law enforcement officials.

Sgt. JAMES I. MINIX, "Special Squad", Miami Police

Department, advised on July 18, 1962, there was wide spread corrup-

tion among the old "hard core" officials in the Miami Police De-

partment. He stated that prior to two years ago the city of Miami

had been divided into districts with a lieutenant in charge of the

district. Each lieutenant had his own "bag man" and controlled

vice in his particular area. Now, according to MINIX, the city

no

longer 1s divided into police districts and each lieutenant or

captain, as the case may be, is in business for himself so that

there is no organized payoff as such anymore.

On July 19, 1962, MM 609-C advised he had heard that

MOE ROCKFELD, FBI #296641, who was recently released from Ralford

Prison, and MONTE GARDNER, formerly associated with the Galety

Night Club in Miami had left the city within the past week and

were to go to Charleston, South Carolina, where they planned to

open a gambling club.
