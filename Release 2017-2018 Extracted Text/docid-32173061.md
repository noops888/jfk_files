ADMINISTRATIVE

INFORMANTS

The Omaha Office advised on November 23,

1963, that former NY 842-C had telephonically contacted

SA JOHN R. ANDERSON from Chicago and advised as follows:

He had in the recent past been associated

with an INA or ENA (LNU), who he described as, a very

active and fanatic member of the Fair Play for Cuba

Committee (FPCC). This girl traveled to California

and Texas in connection with FPCC activities. The girl

had

worked as a barmaid at the Seville Bar, 71st Street

and

Columbus Avenue, New York City, and had regularly

met with other FPCC members at the Crystal Bar, 71st:

Street and Columbus

Avenue, New York City. He furnished

a description of this individual and advised that he

did not know of her whereabouts orl activities for the

past two weeks,

or if she had any connection with the

assassination of the president.

Investigation was conducted to identify

INA or ENA and informants contacted in the New York

area familiar with FPCC activities were unable to furnish

any information.

The possibility existedthat she was

1dentical with ADA MARIE DRITSAS, born October 22, 1936,

New York, Bufile 100-431305, New York file 100-137717,

believed in Havana, Cuba.

No active Investigation was

contucted at the Seville and Crystal Bars, New York City,

Inasmuch as there appeared no need to determine the

whereabouts of all FPCC speakers at that time.
