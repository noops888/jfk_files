It is noted that I. Irving Davidson, registered

agent for

• Nicaragua, shares an office with Jack Anderson.

In reference to the source of Pearson's Information

Barry continued that he got his start in everything from "old

General Somoza". He said this person was starving to death,

and that everything he has he owes either to the Somozas of

to Barry. (Sanson-Roman commented that|Sold General Somoza*

put in that three hundred and some thousand dollars that he

got, well I never put in the donation because I have nothing

do with the donation, they gave it themselves."

Sanson-Roman commented that he had visited the

Protocol

Office at the United States Department of State (USDS).

the morning the Pearson article appeared.

At the USDS, there

was comment to the eftect that Latin American countries could

conceivably give $1,000,000 to the Democratic Party (DP) •

making the comment reasoned by citing the example that

• if the

Latin American countries now see that the Somozas gave $10,000

to tho ep

Nicaragual 21 follows that other countries will try to better

s donation earry felt that such a situation is

commented that the Deputy chief of

Protocol, USDS, told him that he does not consider it a bac

situation because the Nicaraguan Government does not have to

reply to Pearson's article, inasmuch as President Kennedy was

unaware that the somozas gave sio.00e to his campaign.

Sanson-Roman continued, However,

that the Deputy Chiet of

erotocol pointed out that in soite of the actual circumstances

the article will cause people to believe that the Somozas'

donation had influenced the United States aid to Nicaragua.

Sanson-Roman conjectured thai an spite of an

attempt

of the part of Pearson's

source to hurt Barry, it has

all turned out for the best.

Both BarryLand Sanson-Roman

Jagreed that Nicaragua

have been in a very bad situation if it had given the

donationsto Richard Nixon, the Republican candidate for the

Presidency•

Barry indicated that he is going to insist that

Nicaragua take the Nicaraguan gency away from the individual

under discussion and described him as crazy for money with a

desire to be a second Jimmy Hoffa.. Hoffa is President of the

International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehouse-

men and Helpers.

In regard to the above, it is noted that on

February 13, 1963,

"The Washington Post Times Herald"

carried

an article by Drew Pearson which reported that United States

Senate probers had unearthed two political contributions from

Laiss and Anastasio Somoza, President and Secretary of Defense

of Nicaragua respectively.

One contribution was described as

a $10,000 donation to the

1900 presidential campaign of

President Kennedy• Pearson's article pointed out that
