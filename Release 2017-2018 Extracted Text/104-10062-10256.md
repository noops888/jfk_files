DDO STAFF MEETING BRIEF 132

22 February 1978

1. DDCI

The DDCI attended this week's staff meeting.

He spoke

of his appreciation of being able to work directly with

the Operations Directorate, an organization which he has

known from the field.

He said that when he was first

offered the nomination of the post of Deputy Director,

he thought of the Agency primarily in terms of his

perceptions of this Directorate.

He knew that its officers

worked long hours, developed excellent contacts and produced

top-flight reports working always with a strong sense of

dedication. He is planning to have a series of briefings

which will

further acquaint him with the activities of the

Directorate.

Meanwhile he reaffirmed that he had an open

door to persons who had problems of issues that they wished

to bring directly to his attention.

CIA Treaty•

While the Department has expressed very strong

by the position that he expressed during his confirmation

When asked by one Senator about the State/CIA

relacions, he said that he felt this relationship had been

codified to the extent that this was possible and that it

was now a matter for Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station to

work out their own individual arrangements. He hopes that

we will be able to find some way of diffusing this issue so

that we may proceed to other more substantive issues such as

internal reporting responsibilities, communications, and

COVeT.

Specific cover problems were briefly discussed. The

DDO promised to deliver to the DDCI a new inventory of

veeriver ens

those issues

and situations where the Divisions are

encountering problems that they or the DDO had been unable

to resolve with the Department. The Die agreed to take:

look at this catalog of cover problems and asked that a

special paper on cover problems in Africa be forwarded to

him.

Mr. Carlucci spoke of the interest Congress has in

imposing Hughes/Ryan type procedures on sensitive intelligence

operations as well as covert action. He had pointed out two

or die are set the sense Cue operation and the probeen

the difficulty

involved in providing sufficient background and detail to

permit the SSCI to make informed judgments on individual

operations.

2.

Responses to Dr. Brzezinski's Letter

While Dr. Brzezinski has not replied to the letter sent.

earlier to him this month proposing the 32 key countries on

which we would prepare new political reporting plans, we

are working on the presumption that this list is acceptable

to him.

It is planned that we will include sensitive

operational details in a separate annex.

The plan will be

coordinated with NFAC and the Department and then forwarded

with the annex to Dr. Brzezinski.

3. Nemoranda Addressed to DCI and DDCI

Memoranda addressed to the DCI and DDCI concerning their

appointments with Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station should

be in their offices at least three days prior to the

scheduled appointment.

4. Reorganization of the Operations Directorate

The DDO presented his tentative plan for the reorganization

of the Operations Directorate which he will discuss with the

Director within a week.
