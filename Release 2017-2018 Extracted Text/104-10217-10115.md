1. TERESITA GONZALEZ DID NOT ASSUME THAT SHE COULD CONTACT

GORDON M. BINIARIS IHROUGH THE MUTUAL LOCAL PAYMENT OFFICE BUT

MADE THE ATTEMPT BECAUSE SHE WISHED TO PASS INFORMATION THAT :

SHE HAD RECENTLY LEARNED ABOUT HER HUSBAND. SHE HAD NO MEANS

OF REACHING BINIARIS AND AFTER TRYING SEVERAL OTHER POSSIBLITIES

INCLUDING THE PHONE COMPANY, SHE INCLUDED A NOTE WITH HER PAYMENT

RECEIPT IN THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD REACH BINIARIS.

2. BINIARIS WAS HER HUSBAND'S HANDLER IN CUBA AND SHE WAS

WITTING OF THE OPERATIONAL RELATIONSHIP. SUBSEQUENTLY, BINIARIS

MADE THE LOCAL ASSPECIAL PAYMENTS TO HER BEFORE THE MIMUTUAL SYSTE

WAS STARTED.

â€¢ 3. FYI:

AT LEAST SOME AMSPECIAL RECIPIENTS ASSUME SOME SORT

OF WOFIRM RELATIONSHIP WITH MIMUTUAL. A FEW RECIPIENTS WHO DID

.. NOT RECEIVE TIMELY PAYMENTS HAVE CONTACTED AMOIS THEY KNOW TO HAVE

WOFIRM CONNECTIONS TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM.
