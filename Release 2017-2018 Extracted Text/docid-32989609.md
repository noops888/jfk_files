It was pointed out that

was in line with informal discussions you (Mr.

Bishop)

have had with members of your staff concerning a possible

name change for the Division.

In this connection, Mr. Gray has noted that •

he "can think of many reasons for changing the name.

What have been the nature of the reasons ‹for change discussed?"

With the formation of the Computer Systems Division

and the resultant reassignment of the personnel and

the work of the Uniform Crime Reporting Section, including

the National Crime Information Center/Computerized Criminal

Histories file from Crime Records to Computer Systems,

the title "Crime Records," as

has indicated,

is no longer meaningful insofar as the work of this

Division is concerned.

"Office of Public Information," which was

suggested by

would inaccurately reflect

the activities and responsibilities of this Division

OBSERVATIONS

Agent personnel and supervisory functions have been analyzed and dealt with

in the foregoing proposed reallocations; clerical functions have not. It is suggested

that clerical functions and personnel no simply move with the Agent desks and

units tö which they are attached. Questions of space also häve not been covered

and it is readily apparent that a substantial portion of the functions and personnel

suggested for transfer to Training Division might feasibly operate at Quantico

(e.g. Library, Special Productions and Publications Unit). Five units of Training :

Division are now located at Headquarters and the Research Unit of Research and

Service Section proposed herein for transfer to Training Division, likewise should -

remain at Headquarters. Accordingly*

formerly in the

Front Oilice of Crime Research Division, has been proposed for transfer to Training

Dirision in order to act, during this transition period, as a special coordinator

of functions that may be divided between Headquarters and Quantico.

The questions of adequacy of clerical personnel, space reallocation, and

ADDENDUM OF W. M. FELT

12-6-72 WMF:ert

this appears logical and feasible.. I snags develop we can

readjust. I agree that the Research and Service unctions, which will remain

under:

shouid be reassigned to the Training

Division, I do not believe that this Section should be transierred to Quantico,

however, because there is daily need for access to files and other material

at Headquarters and occasional contacts with the public. Turthermore, were

is no available space at Quantico except in the Library Building. Accordingly,

I recommend that the FBIHQ Libracy.be moved into the Library Building ai.

Quantico. We would need to retain at TBIl@ the telephone directories and

encyclopedias which are used on a daily basis by other Divisions. The

space into which the FBIHe Library was to have been moved in the 9th and D

Suilding can be used and in fact is badly needed by the Domestic Intelligence

Division which is very crowded.

I recommend that you approve now the transier of functions and

that any necessary realignment of personnel be considered by separate

memoranda.

A survey has been made of the library, its books, facility and

corridor at FBI Headquarters and has a staff of the following:

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

From a survey of the books, all books can be removed from the

library to the library at Quantico with exception to certain reference books

and out-of-town telephone directories which are necessary to be maintained at FBI

Headquarters for ready-reference purposes by the Bureau staff at Headquarters.

• In the library is a lending library which has about i00 members.

These members pay $1 every six months for membership dues and have the privilege

of using the library. Because of the minor use of this lending library, I am proposin

that we phase out this part of the library during the next six months, removing the

books at the end of that period to Quantico.

from the survey, I believe that the two library technicians, who are

telephone directories and that when

I returns to work a decision can be

made as to what can be done with her.

Since practically all of the library will be transferred to Quantico,

it will be necessary to transfer certain employees of the library unit.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That all the books with the exception of the reference books,

at Quantico.

Bureau Library at FBI Headquarters

A survey has been made of the library, its books, facility and

personnel. At the present time, the library is housed in six rooms in the 4200

corridor at FBI Headquarters and has a staff of the following:

Inspector Bernand M. Suttler, GS-16

Ilorarian lona triswann, Go-s

Accistant Librarian Eleanor In Denick, GS-E

Secretary Connie: Hutchison, GS-4 (position is GS-5)

3 Librarian Technicians

Alica Brand, CS-4 (on extended leave without pay - due to illness)

Patricia, auber, Go-o (G0-4 position)

Ester Vtilanueva, GS-4

From a survey of the books, all books can be removed from the

library to the library at Quantico with exception to certain reference books.

and out-of-town telephone directories which are necessary to be maintained at FBI

Headquarters for ready-reference purposes by the Bureau staff at Headquarters.

from the survey, it was determined these books can be maintained in two rooms*

presently occupied by the library, thus freeing four rooms as surplus spade."

In the library is a lending library which has about 100 members.

These members pay $1 every six months for membership dues and have the privilege

of using the library. Because of the minor use of this lending library, I am proposing

that we phase out this part of the library during the next six months, removing the

books at the end of that period to Quantico.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

SUGGESTED NAME. CHANGE

CRIME RECORDS DIVISION

By memorandum dated 10-4-72, attached, it was

indicated that Fletcher D. Thompson, SAC, Omaha, has suggested

a name change for the Crime Records Division to Office

of public Information or some other more meaningful designation..

It was pointed out that Mr. Thompson's suggestion

was in line with informal discussions you (Mr. Bishop)

have had with members of your staff concerning a possible

name change for the Division.

In this connection, Mr. Gray has noted that

he "can think of many reasons for changing the name.

What have been the nature of the reasons for change discussed?"

With the formation of the Computer Systems Division

and the resultant reassignment of the personnel and

the work of the Uniform Crime Reposting Section, including

the National Crime Information Center/Computerized Criminal

Histories file from Crime Records to Computer Systems,

the title "Crime Records," as Mr. Thompson has

indicated,

is no longer meaningful insofar as the work of this

Division is concerned..

"Office of Public Information," which was

suggested by Mr. Thompson, would inaccurately reflect

the activities and responsibilities of this Division

and could result in confusion with the Office of Public

Information in the Department of Justice.

This, of

course, would be undesirable.

Here"s

coole cared go Baccagemen

Pursuant to your instructions, Assistant Director Bishop is

being temporarily attached to the Training Division at Quantico for special

assignment until the effective date of his retirement, 2-1-73.

Mr. Bishop will be assigned to the research and development of

a major case practical problem for use in the National Academy. This

is extremely important because our experience indicates that most of the

officers attending the Academy are unable to understand and handle the

ramifications of major cases. Mr. Bishop, with his extensive field back-

ground, plus his familiarity with news media problems, is ideally suited

to handle this assignment.

2 ' I he has time. Mr. Bishop will also analyze and develop

• meaningful practical cases which will enable new agents to meet present-

day needs.

I have arranged with Mr. Jenkins for suitable office facilities

to be used by Mr. Bishop at Quantico and have instructed Bishop to report

to Mr. Jenkins on Monday, 12-1-72.

Inspector Wilburn-K. DeBruler is being diverted from his current

inspection assignment in the Office of Legal Counsel to begin an immediate

survey of the Crime Research Division to determine the feasibility of the

transfer of its functions to other divisions or to your office.

remain at Headquarters. Accordingly, SA Harold P. Leinbaugh, formerly in the

Front Office of Crime Research Division, has been proposed for transfer to Training

5/, This appears logical and feasible. I snags develop we car;

readjuste

hagree that the Research and Service functions, which will remain

under Section Chiet Milton A. Jones, should be reassigned to the Trating

Division. I do not believe that this Section should be transferred to Quantico,

however, because there is daily need for access to files and other material

at Headquarters and occasional contacts with the puolic.. Furthermore, there •

is no available space at Quantico except in the Library Building. Accordingly,

I recommend that the FBIHQ Library be moved into the Library, Bullding at

Quantico. We would need to retain at FBIHQ the telephone directories and

encyclopedias which are used on a daily basis by other Divisions. The

space into which the FBIHQ Library was to have been moved in the 9th and D

Building can be used and in fact is badly needed by the Domestic Intelligence

Division which is very crowded.

I recommend that you approve now the transfer of functions and

that any necessary realignment of personnel be considered by separate

memoranda.

RE: ITTERVIRI OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

he was asked how many men worked under him on his Squad, he

told Epstein that he desired to consult with the FBI

representative who had accompanied him to the intervion but

who was not present during the actual intervier, that

representative remaining in an outer lobby of the SSC quarters.

Belter requested this consultation privilege as he belleved

the question vas outsido the indicated scope of the intervion.

Ipstein Indicated he vas vithcraving the question, thus

eliminating the necessity for the consultation.

Belter was questioned and furnished infornation

concerning the organization of VO, from the Special Agenc

In Charge down to the squad level. Belter indicated that

there verc several squads handling criminal cases, some

handling applicant-type investigations, and other squads

handling security rock. He indicated that the security squads

vere under a security coordinator, ludvig ll. R. Oberndors,

now deceased.

Epstein advised Belter that the SSC Staff had

read Belter's deposition in the Halperin case. (Morion H.

Halperin; et al, vs. Henry A. kissinger, et al, United States

Discrict court, District of Columbia Civil Action File

Number 118/-/3.) On the basis of the deposition, Ipstein

Indicated he was familiar with the administrative procedure

for instituting telephone surveillances and asked Belter

about the aininistrative procedures for instituting microphone

surveillances.

It was Belter's reply that the acministrative

procedures vere essentially the same for both types of

surveillances.

Epstein then had Belter recite the procedure from

when an SA vould request fron FBI Headquarters by form letter

authority for installing a microphone surveillance. Belter

told how the Headquarters vould first authorize the field to

RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

conduct a feasibility survey, results of which would be

furnished Headquarters. Thereafter, if the installation was

feasible and juatified, Headquarters would authorize by

correspondence the installation. Epstein asked whether the

authorizing communication from Headquarters would mention

that the Attorney Ganeral (AG) had authorized the surveillance.

Belter told Epstein that in recent years he belleved that the

Bureau communication nuthorizing a surveillance would indicate

that the AG authorization had been obtained; but Belter could

not recall whether or not this Indication was shown during

1964. Belter also told Epstein that at one time he thought

that former FBI Director Hoover did not need to have At approval

1n advance for a specific microphone gurveillance. Epstein

indicated he was already aware of this.

Epstain then inquired concerning a microphone

survelllance which the FBI had installed at the Willard Hotel

In Washington, D. C., concerning King. Belter was unable

to pinpoint when this occurred and told Epstein that he,

Belter, was bypassed in practically all metters relating to

this surveillance. The entire matter was handled by Security

Coordinator Oberndorf and Belter never saw any of the correspond-

ence relating thereto. Belter was only asked to furnish some

support personnel from his Squad for the purpose of monitoring

the surveillance. In response to further specific questions,

Belter advised Epstein that he did not see any correspondence,

logs, tapes, or any other material relating to this surveillance.

Epstein inquired about the procedure of an Inspector

checking on such a surveillance at the time of a perfodic

Inspection of WFO. He asked If the Inspector would examine

the required correspondence relating to all microphone

survelllances the office had conducted. Belter replied that

an Inspector would look over matters of this nature but that

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

In the case of the King microphone surveillance, as with

certain other extremely sensitive ones, Oberndorf would have

possession of the correspondence and Belter would ba unaware

of any examination of such correspondence by an Inspector.

Belter expleined that this was part of the security precautions

taken in highly sensitive matters which vere restricted

within WFO to a need-to-know basis.

Epstein inquired as to whether Belter knew of any

other microphone surveillance on king in the Washington, D. C.,

axes at any time and Belter replied that he did not know of

any. Belter was asked if he was aware of any Interest or

participation by the Washington, D. C., Pollce Department in

the microphone surveillance at the Willard Hotel and he

responcied that he was not aware of same.

Epstein Inquired as to the actual installation of

the microphone surveillance at the Hillard Hotel and wanted

to know who performed the installation. It was Balter's

recollection that the installation vas made by SA Wilfred

Bergeron, probably assisted by SA Willian D. Campbell. Epstein

volunteered the name of sA Richard Suter and this refreshed

Belter'y recollection to the extent that Belter indicated that

Suter also probably assisted. On Epstein's Inquity as to the

whereabouts of these three individuals, Belter advised that

Bergeron is retired, residing in Bethesda, Maryland; Campbell

Is assigned at FBI Headquarters; and Suter is assigned to the

Houston Fleld office.

Epstein inguired whether Bergeron mentioned King's

name when Bergeron asked for assistance of support persomel

for monitoring purposes and Belter replled that King's name

was mentioned.

At the close of the interview, Epstein renarked that,

"We may be in touch with you again."

Senate Select Committee Request: Appendix D, Item 17 -

Joseph Kraft

The SSC's request of Item 17, Appendix D, seeks "All memo-

randa and other materials reflecting written or oral authorization

and re-authorization by the Attorney General and/or the Director of

the FBI for electronic surveillance of Joseph Kraft'.

By letter of May 2, 1975, to Kraft's attorney, Lloyd Cutler,

inter alia, the following assurances:

"Pending further Departmental action relating to the policies

which will govern records of the type involved in Mr. Kraft's

case, all documents, recordings, or other records of any type in

the Department's custody or control which constitute, surmarize,

or describe the contents of the overhearings obtained as the result

of any electronic surveillance directed against Mir. Kraft and

members of his family will be placed under seal"

It is my view (shared by Mr.

BEC-102 at 013 95-285

well, by Cutler in telephone conversations with me on June 12, and

June 16, 1975 (the second call came after Cutler had conferred with

Kraft) that the material sought by the Senate Select Committee

distinct from that protected by seal and that, therefore, the

requested material be found, reviewed and forwarded to the SCe

(Cutler advised that the Ervin Committee was given same).

DATE

By memorandum dated 6-4-75 you were advised that

captioned Committee was preparing what they termed case studies on

COINTELPROS in four separate areas. The areas defined were Black

Panther Party in San Francisco, White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of

Mississippi, the Professor Morris J. Starsky incident, and the

2 40/01

Fred Hampton case (Black Panther Party leader in Chicago who was

killed during a police raid in Chicago, Illinois).

Mr. Lester B. Seidel advised SA Paul V. Daly 6-9-75 '

that in addition to the aforementioned areas he also wanted to include the

Muhammad Kenyatta case in Philadelphia. As an observation, two of the

areas cited by Mr. Seidel are areas where the Bureau currently is façing

lawsuits, namely, the Hampton and Kenyatta cases, and a third area is

one which we could well be involved in a lawsuit, that being the starsky

case. Mr. Seidel indicated the Bureau can expect correspondence from

the Committee concerning these matters.

DATE

On the evening of 5-29-75, Lester B. Seidell telephonically

advised SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that in accordance with the

"guidelines" existing between the Committee and the various intelligence

agencies under review, he was giving notice that he as a representative

of the Committee was going to San Francisco in approximately two to three

weeks, and it was his intention to interview SAC Charles W. Bates, former

SA David E. Todd, and former Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont.

He also requested Assistant Director Gebhardt be made available for staff

interview in Washington, D. C. He asked that the Bureau take the necessary

steps to release the Agents from any existing employment or secrecy

agreements. For the purposes of this interview, he stated he would inquire

16-144

of each of the interviewees as to their knowledge and participation in counter-

intelligence activities directed against the Black Panther Party. With regards

to this discussion, he specifically mentioned a Bureau airtel to San Francisco

dated 5-11-70, titled "Counterintelligence and Special Operations (Research

Section)." He stated this document was one of the documents released by

the court in the suit by newscaster Carl Stern. He was asked as to whether

Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams

Re: SENSTUDY 75

in writing, which would coincide with the aforementioned topic of interview.

He described these interviews as being "abuse" interviews which according

to the Committee's understanding precludes the presence of an agency

representative during interview. However, an Agent may be available for

consultation purposes.

Mr. Seidell was advised by SA Daly that former Assistant

to the Director Belmont was in poor health and that before attempting interview

of Mr. Belmont, he should ascertain his current physical condition. Mr. Seidell

requested SA Daly determine Mr. Belmont's physical condition. Assistant

Director Cleveland advised SA Daly on 5-30-75 that Mr. Belmont was very

seriously ill and was suffering from the Shy Drager Syndrome. This informa-

tion was brought to the attention of John Elliff, Task Force Director on

Domestic Intelligence Activities of captioned Committee, and Elliff expressed

dismay that Seidell had made an inquiry concerning the interview of Belmont.

Elliff requested that we not take any action concerning Seidell's request as

ito Belmont at this time.

Former SA David E. Todd had previously contacted this

Division and as set forth in memorandum dated 5-16-75 from Legal Counsel

to J. B. Adams, he was advised of his rights, the existence of an employment

secrecy agreement signed by him, of the provisions of Attorney General

Order 501-73, and to his right to a private attorney. He was also advised

that an Agent would be made available for consultation during the interview

if he so desired. Mr. Todd did not indicate at this point whether he was

desirous of having a Bureau representative available for consultation during

interview. Todd, according to Seidell, stated he would not consider to be

interviewed in the absence of a release of a secrecy agreement by the Bureau.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That former SA David E. Todd, Assistant Director

Robert E. Gebhardt, and SAC Charles W. Bates be released from their

employment and secrecy agreemensfor purposes of a staff interview concerning

our Cointelpro activities against the Black Panther Party.

This is

to record meeting of Task Force

• (TF)

leaders with Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the

President, at the Executive Office Building on 6/13/75.

Aforementioned meeting was called and chaired by

Mr. Wilderotter, and was attended by representatives of The

White House, Justice, Defense, FBI, CIA, and State.

Manager W. O. Cregar

Project

and Supervisor J. P. Thomas, Section CI-2,

INTD, represented

the FBI.

Mr. Wilderotter reported that the Senate Select

Committee (SSC) has agreed to specifically identify a limited

number of "abuse areas" which it will investigate from top to

bottom.

"Notices" should be issued to agencies very shortly

defining certain terms and specifying the SSC targets. If

these areas can be fully investigated, with assistance of the

intelligence community,

the SSC agrees to not extend its inquiries

beyond the specified areas. If the SSC does so limit its

inquiries, this will be

to the advantage of the intelligence

community

in that it will minimize the SC's straying into

91-2

various nonpertinent matters; the Trs can present the intelli-

gence community's

side on the topics examined; the Trs should

be able to expedite the Committee's inquiries and thereby limit

the duration of the SSC investigation.

The FBI has responsibility for the TEs on "Political

Abuses," TF leader Insp. H. E. Helgeson, and

"Use of Notional

Organizations," Tr leader Supv. J. P. Thomas. We cannot fully

address either topic until receiving the SSC notices defining

the extent of the proposed inquiries.

Contrary to the initial concept of the Ts, they will

not prepare comprehensive papers regarding their topics, but in

some areas it may be advantageous for a TF to prepare an

"opening statement" type paper for the SSC.

Memorandum to

Mr.

Re:

SENSTUDY

75

62-116395

W. R. Wannall

The purpose of the TE and functions of the TE

leaders were discussed.

Briefly, each Tr leader is to become

a substantive expert on the particular topic assigned to him

(e.g• political abuses), locate all documents, identify

potential witnesses, develop strategy for presenting subject

matter to the SSC and work to minimize any delays which might

be caused by the Third Agency Rule. TF leaders will not

themselves be witnesses unless their activities other than as

If leaders are subjects of testimony. TE leaders will, in

consultation with legal counsel, define terms pertinent to

topics.

insofar as the SSC is receptive, the scope and direction of

pertinent inquiry, who is and is not competent to testify,

what documents are available, and what areas may or may not be

pertinent to the Committee's

interests.

TF leaders will prepare

themselves to be able to answer any inquiries from the

White House on their topics. Although TF leaders must know

the location of all documents pertinent,

the documents them-

selves will be made available to the SSC by the agency having

custody of same and each agency may negotiate with the SSC

regarding access by the Committee to material on a case by

case basis.

The agencies will, of course, coordinate first

with their

own legal counsel and then with the White House

before releasing documents.

On sensitive matters, such as notional organizations

or proprietary organizations,

the SSC has agreed that it will

not be necessary for agencies to furnish the names of U.S.

citizens and companies who have cooperated with the U. S. unless

those persons or companies have received notoriety (e.g. Hughes

Tool Company, Sam Giancana). It is reportedly understood that

agencies must protect their ongoing operations. Agencies are

free to attempt to negotiate with

the SSC regarding the extent

and form of their responses.

Attached is a copy of an intelligence community staff

memorandum 6/10/75 showing the IF assignments and, in the left

margin notes as to the agencies expected to have input into

each subject.

I have just today received your letter dated May 28.

It apparently reached the Department of Justice on June 8.

It requests "the delivery forthwith to the members whose

names are listed in the attachment hereto of any files on

them of documents concerning them that are in the possession,

custody, or control of the Department of Justice, including

the Federal Bureau of Investigation."

The Department wants to cooperate with you on this

matter. But I think we first ought to clarify the

scope

of your request. I assume, for example, that your request

is not intended to encompass

copies of all letters between

the members and the

Department. I would suggest that we can

reach an understanding on issues of this kind by consulta-

tions

between us.

, Your letter says that "Whether as a matter of agree-

ment between the Committee and the Department some material

that may be in any such files should be withheld depends upon

an analysis of the weight of the particular reason put forward

for the proposed withholding balanced against the Committee's

need to exercise its mandatje."

I take that to mean you would like us to go over the

files and to raise with the Committee such problems with dis-

closure as may or may not exist. I realize this request is

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Electronic Surveillance Legislation

1. Over a dozen bills have been introduced in Congress to date

aimed at restricting electronic surveillance conducted on national security

grounds. Although impelled by concern for the Fourth Amendment rights of

American citizens, the major bills in this area (S. 743, H.R. 141, H.R. 214)

are characterized by a heavy-handed approach which poses a serious threat

to the exploitation of foreign SIGINT sources, both within the United States

and overseas. (Signals intelligence subsumes communications intelligence

and electronic intelligence.)

2. The 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (18 U.S.C.

2510, et seg.) established certain procedures which require the Government

to obtain a court order issued on probable cause prior to conducting wire or

oral communication interception in the investigation of certain offenses.. In

section 2511(3) of that Act, Congress specifically disavows any limitation on

the constitutional powers of the President in national security matters and

recognizes that the President has inherent constitutional authority to engage

in certain foreign intelligence activities:

(n)othing contained in this chapter or in

section 605 of the Communications Act of

1934 shall limit the constitutional power of

the President... to obtain foreign intelli-

gence information deemed essential to the

security of the United States, or to protect

national security information against foreign

intelligence activities. (emphasis added)

The emphasized language implicitly recognizes that foreign intelligence

surveillances may be distinguished from national security surveillances

aimed at the discovery and prosecution of criminal conspiracies and activity.

3. In reliance on these Presidential powers and congressional

recognition thereof, foreign intelligence signal and communication interceptions

may be conducted within the United States without judicial warrant.

4. Sentiment that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) (quoted above).

are incompatible with Fourth Amendment rights has spawned a Senate bill and

over a dozen House bills (some of these identical) aimed at closing what the

sponsors view as "the national security loophole" in current surveillance laws.

A distinctive approach to national security surveillance is taking shape which

would prohibit the use of warrantless surveillance for any reason whatsoever,

treating national security surveillance under a single rubric, without distin-

guishing between gathering foreign intelligence on the one hand, and national

security surveillances aimed at the discovery and prosecution of criminality,

on the other..

(a) S. 743 by Senators Nelson and Kennedy would amend

18 U.S.C. 2510, et seg., as follows: First, repeal 18 U.S.C.

2511(3) thereby withdrawing whatever congressional recognition

that section gave the foreign intelligence surveillance powers of

the President. Second, prohibit intercepting the communications

of an American citizen or alien admitted for permanent residence

until a prior judicial warrant is obtained issued on probable cause

that a specific crime, e.g., espionage, has been or is about to be

committed. Third, prohibit intercepting the communication of a

foreign power or its agent until a prior judicial warrant is obtained

by establishing probable cause (a) that such interception is

necessary to protect the national defense (note narrower standard

than national security); (b) that the interception will be consistent

with the international obligations of the United States; and (c) that

the target is a foreign power or foreign agent. (A foreign agent is

defined as any person, not an American citizen or alien lawfully

admitted for permanent residence, whose activities are intended

to serve the interests of a foreign power and to undermine the

national defense. Each application for such an interception would

be made to the D. C. Federal District Court on personal and written

authorization of the President and would provide detailed informa-

tion on the target, the purposes and justification of the interception.)

Upon court approval, only the FBI would be authorized to intercept

the communication.

Fourth, require that every American citizen

targetted be informed of the specifics of the surveillance within a

month of the last authorized interception. (This disclosure could

be postponed if the Government satisfies the court that the target

is engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise or that disclosure

would endanger national security interests. A foreign power or

its agent need not be informed of interceptions.) Fifth, require the

Attorney General to report to the Congress, at least quarterly, the

details of each interception undertaken on national security

grounds, to be filed with the Senate Foreign Relations and

Judiciary Committees and the House International Relations and

Judiciary Committees.

(b) H. R. 141 by Representative Kastenmeier, Chairman of

the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the

Administration of Justice, which has legislative jurisdiction for

surveillance, is similar to the above bill. It would repeal

18 U.S.C. 2511(3) and amend Title 18 to permit communications

interception in national security cases only under court order

issued on probable cause that an individual has committed one of

several enumerated offenses or is engaged in activities intended to

serve the interests of a foreign principal and to undermine the

national security. (From the language of the bill, it could be

argued that the foreign agent's activities would have to constitute

a criminal offense before a warrant could be issued.) The bill

"does not mention the communications of a foreign power.

Each application for an interception would have to be authorized

by the Attorney General and made to a Federal judge of com-

petent jurisdiction. The targetted individual would be informed

of the surveillance within ninety days. The President, Attorney

General, and all Government agencies would be required to

supply Congress, through the Senate Judiciary and Foreign

Relations Committees and the House Judiciary and International

Relations Committees, any information regarding any interception

applied for.

:(c) H. R. 214 by Mr. Mosher and seven identical bills

co-sponsored by over 70 Congressmen from both parties, would

prohibit any interception of communications, surreptitious entry,

mail-opening, or the procuring and inspection of records of

telephone, bank, credit, medical, or other business or private

transactions of any individual without court order issued on

probable cause that a crime has been committed. Like S. 743

and H. R. 141, reviewed above, H.R. 214 would repeal 18 U.S.C.

2511(3). Unlike the above bills, H.R. 214 does not provide for non-

law enforcement surveillance. It would also strike out pro-

visions for summary procedures for intercepting communications

during emergencies and would require that detailed information

on each application for a communication interception be reported

to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. •

5. Intelligence Community Interests: These bills, through

imposing judiciary administration over all surveillance, would impair existing

responsibility to conduct electronic surveillance in gathering foreign positive

intelligence, which now reaches wholly domestic communications, those both

transmitted and received within the United States; wholly foreign communications,

those both transmitted and received abroad; and transnational communications,

international communications received in or transmitted from the United States.

H# 55024 DocId: 32989609

## Page 127

SIGINT provides a broad range of foreign intelligence ranging from early

warning indicators to the most mundane information. The importance of any

single intercept or series of interceptions cannot be anticipated in advance;

therefore, the probable cause standard and the proposed requirements of

"particularity" are inappropriate in connection with this method of foreign intelli-

gence collection. (Furthermore, the House bills would impair existing responsibility

for using other intelligence gathering techniques against foreign subjects within the

United States, e.g., medicepts, photo surveillance, etc.)

6. Effect on Intelligence Community Interests: The bills reviewed above

would severely restrict domestic communications interception for foreign intelligence

gathering purposes; raise serious questions respecting authority to intercept

transnational communications; and would even raise questions concerning the

foreign intelligence community's authority to conduct electronic surveillance abroad

free from judicial intrusion or other conditions. (Moreover, the House bills

would restrict the use of other intelligence gathering techniques against foreign

targets within the United States.)

(a) Domestic Electronic Surveillance: An operation

mounted against a foreign target within the United States to

gather foreign positive intelligence would apparently not meet the

court test unless the specific message targetted involved an anti-

cipated, demonstrable and direct threat to the national defense.

S. 743 explicitly confers interception authority to the FBI alone.

It also explicitly raises the issue of the consistency of surveillance

with international obligations, e. g, the Vienna Convention, and

thus challenges the position taken by the State Department that no

current international obligation precludes targetting foreign

facilities within the United States.

(b) Transnational Electronic Surveillance: Proposed

legislation would apparently subject the interception of trans-

national communications from a situs within the United States to

the probable cause standard. It could also provide grounds for

arguing that interceptions of transnational communications from

facilities outside the United States would be subject to the same

standard.

(c) Foreign Electronic Surveillance: The bills

reviewed above are broadly written and the prohibitions are not

expressly limited to the territory of the United States. While the

reach of this legislation should be subject to the built-in limitation

that the authority of a federal court to issue warrants is confined

to its territorial limits, repeal of 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) and the

articulation of probable cause standards for foreign intelligence

gathering activities could have a grave impact on overseas

intelligence collection by bringing into play a body of exclusionary

rule case law (developed in ruling on the admissability in a

Federal criminal trial of evidence obtained overseas by electronic

surveillance). Suffice it, here, to say that this could result in

4

НН 55024 DooId:32989609 •Page 127

SECRET

---

## Page 128

SEGRET

subjecting overseas foreign intelligence surveillance to the proposed

probable cause standards as a test of the "reasonableness" required

by Fourth Amendment protections. Moreover, this legislation could

raise complex questions in situations where an element of the inter-

ception process falls within the jurisdiction of the federal court, e.g.,

the physical presence of the surveillance device. Even if these bills

would not directly affect authority to conduct foreign electronic

surveillance, they could ultimately weaken it by raising the

opportunity to argue that this authority rests only on three

bases--assertion of inherent Presidential intelligence-gathering

powers, congressional recognition and judicial acceptance. Repeal

of 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) may be viewed as weakening the argument that

Congress has recognized foreign intelligence gathering authority

inherent in the President and delegated to his Executive branch agents.

7. Summary:

--Proposed legislation would repeal 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) and would

impose judicial administration of a "probable cause"

standard over foreign intelli-

gence electronic surveillance. At the very least, this would restrict communications

interceptions against foreign targets within the United States to situations

involving an anticipated, demonstrable and direct threat to the national defense.

Also, this would probably subject the interception of transnational communica-

tions, from either an overseas or domestic situs, to the same judicial standards.

Finally, this would raise difficult questions concerning the ability of CIA, NSA,

and the service cryptologic agencies to conduct electronic surveillance overseas

against foreign targets without conforming to the standards of Fourth Amendment

"reasonableness" articulated in this legislation. In sum, enactment of proposed

legislation would severely restrict the collection and processing of foreign

SIGINT and would seriously impair the production of all-source intelligence.

--By repealing 18 U.S.C. 2511(3) and by introjecting the judiciary

into the field of foreign intelligence gathering, proposed legislation raises a

constitutional challenge insofar as it purports to withdraw sanction of and

place limitations on the President's inherent power to conduct foreign

surveillance. This infringement could undermine the Executive sources of

authority upon which the intelligence community depends. To be sure, the

proposed requirement of prior judicial authorization of foreign intelligence

surveillances is altogether impractical. But the fundamental constitutional

objection is that it purports to share Executive authority with judicial officers

having no expertise in or responsibility for national security or foreign

affairs.

The necessity of a foreign intelligence surveillance is simply

inappropriate for judicial resolution. It is a matter committed to the Executive

branch by the Constitution and an area for which there are no judicially

manageable standards.. An arrangement by which federal judges decide

what foreign intelligence the President may have in his conduct of foreign

5

SECRET

relations is incompatible with the Chief Executive's inherent foreign

intelligence gathering powers. Since this Presidential authority is

constitutional in nature and stems from a fundamental separation of

governmental powers, a Congressional attempt to require its sharing

with the judiciary would certainly lead to protracted constitutional

litigation. Moreover, Congress implicitly authorized the use of elec-

tronic surveillance in foreign intelligence activities and this legislation

would circumscribe the very functions which Congress intended the

Agency to perform.

SCOPE OF FBI AUTHORITY,

JURISDICTION AND RESPONSIBILITY IN

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

BACKGROUND

Over the past several months there have been an increasing

number of public statements made from

various quarters questioning

or contesting

authority and jurisdiction of the FBI to conduct

domestic intelligence-type investigations, particularly where

there is

no clear-cut legislative authority apparent.

most searching inquiries was contained in a paper presented by

Professor John T.

Elliff at a two-day conference at Princeton

University in October, 1971, sponsored by the Committee for Public

Justice.

Professor Elliff addressed himself to the matter of

FBI authority derived

legislative enactments as opposed to

that derived from

Presidential directives.

went into some

detail in connection with the Presidential directive issued by

President Roosevelt

in September, 1939, which was

subsequently

reiterated on three occasions.

questioned whether Roosevelt

aware that he was

shifting FBI

authority from congressional

Presidential directive when he issued the September,

directive since he probably assumed he had granted such

authority in 1936 when he requested intelligence investigations

of fifth columnists.

Elliff

accused the FBI of magnifying the

September, 1939, directive into a definitive order.

Over a long period of time Senator Sam J. Ervin has been

probing into the nature and extent of FBI gathering and

retention

of domestic intelligence information.

In April, 1971,

Senator Ervin made a request of the Department of Justice to

furnish detailed information concerning the Department's (the FBI's)

policy and practice on investigating and reporting the political

beliefs and activities of persons not under investigation for

violating the laws.

Of particular interest was specific infor-

mation on the constitutional authority and power exercised by the

Executive Branch to conduct such investigations.

Subsequently, Senator Ervin announced that he intended to

propose legislation to prohibit the FBI from investigating any

person without his consent, unless the Government has reason to

believe that person has

committed a crime or is about to commit

a crime. Other Congressmen have either introduced or announced

plans to introduce legislation or resolutions calling for special

activities, particularly in the area of domestic intelligence

operations.

Based on these developments it became apparent that

an in-depth study was in order to clarify any misconceptions

which might have grown up concerning the scope of FBI intelligence

and investigative

authority, particularly where it concerns

domestic organizations and/or individuals. A detailed and

exhaustive study has now been completed, and the following is

the result of that study.

AUTHORITY DERIVED PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES

In the testimony of the late Director J. Edgar Hoover

before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations on March

2, 1972,

under the subject of justifications on page 2 the statement is

made that "The FBI's responsibilities in the domestic intelligence

are authorized under legislative enactments,

Presidential

directives

and instructions of the Attorney General. They include

investigative jurisdiction over matters

relating to

espionage,

counterespionage, sabotage, treason, sedition, subversion, and

related internal security functions.

Subjects of investigation

include the activities

of the Communist Party, USA,

communist

front groups and other totalitarian organizations,

including

individuals or groups who are alleged either to seek overthrow

of the Government of the United States by force or violence

conspire against the rights of citizens." Similar

language has

appeared in Mr. Hoover's testimony in prior years.

assumed that the Presidential directives referred

to in Mr. Hoover's testimony are (1) Dixective dated September 6,

1939, and reiterated January 8, 1943, July 24, 1950, and

December 15,

1953; (2) Executive Order 10450 dated April 27, 1953

amended but not yet implemented by Executive Order

dated July 2, 1971).

It is believed that there is a misconception concerning

the extent of jurisdiction or authority which was conveyed to

the FBI by the Presidential directive dated September 6, 1939.

All of the succeeding directives appear to be hinged on

the one

Therefore, the language of that first

very important issue. Perhaps even more

important are the circumstances leading up to the issuance of

that directive and the intent of the President at the time

it was issued.

Prior to the issuance of the September, 1939, directive

President Roosevelt issued a statement or confidential

directive

to the heads of the

various Government Departments on June 26,

1939, which stated,

is my desire that the investigation of

espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage matters be controlled

and handled by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation of the

Department of Justice, the Military Intelligence Division of

War Departmont, and the Office of Naval Intelligence of the

Navy Department. The Directors of these three

agencies

function

as a committee to coordinate their activities."

NN 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 137

## Page 138

"No investigations should be conducted by any investi

gative agency of the Government into matters involving actually

or potentially any espionage, counterespionage, or sabotage,

except by the three agencies

mentioned

above."

"I shall be glad if you will instruct the heads of all

other investigative agencies than the three named, to refer

immediately to the nearest office of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation

any data, information or material that may come to

their notice bearing directly or indirectly on espionage,

counterespionage, or sabotage."

It is to be noted that in this statement or directive

the language, with the

exception of the word "counterespionage"

deals with

matters comino clearly within legislative enactments.

The September, 1939, directive stated, "The Attorney

General has been requested by

me to instruct the Federal Bureau

of Investigation

of the Department of Justice to take charge of

investigative work in matters

relating to espionage, sabotage,

and violations

the neutrality regulations.

"This task must be conducted in a comprehensive and

effective manner on

a national basis, and all information must be

carefully sifted

out

and correlated in order to avoid confusion

and

irresponsiblity.

"To this end I request all police officers, sheriffs,

and all other law enforcement officers in the United States

promptly to turn over to the nearest representative of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation

any information obtained by them

relating

to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, subversive activities

and violations of the neutrality laws."

In this document it is particularly important to note

that the language says the FBI is

to "take charge of investiga-

and not "assume jurisdiction" or "have authority to

investigate" matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and

violations of the neutrality regulations.

The statutory authority

to investigate the enumerated crimes was

already present, but

directive fixed responsibility for the FBI

the

to conduct the

investigations.

In other words, this directive conveyed no

authority not already possessed

by the FBI by legislative enactment

but merely established that no

other investigative agency should

handle the matters.

WH 55021 DocId:32989609 Page 138

Ine last paragraph of this particular directive, which

actually a request of all local law enforcement agencies,

used the words "counterespionage" and "subversive activities."

However, the context of the statement appears

national security so that all such matters, irrespective of the

legal definition or name, would be turned over to the FBI.

logical

conclusion, based purely on examination of

the language used in the

September, 1939, directive, is that

the directive merely put everyone on notice that the FBI had the

responsibility to investigate the statutory crimes named; that

it provided no so-called "constitutional" or.

"executive

authority" for the FBI to investigate matters not covered by

Legislative enactment. This is not to say that the President

constitutional authority (he has), but only that it

was not exercised here.

As a matter of particular interest, Professor Elliff,

in questioning whether President Roosevelt was aware that he

shifting FBI authority from Congressional enactment to

Presidential directive since he assumed that he had

granted such

authority

in 1936, was at least half correct. While no shift

of authority appears to have occurred as a result of the 1939

diroctive,

we have historical

evidence to show that the President

instructed the PBI

to conduct subversive intelligence-type

investigations of radicals in 1935.

In this regard, there

appears

to be little doubt that Roosevelt conveyed some degree of

Executive authority to the FBI.

AUTHORITY CONVEYED EVEN BEFORE 1939 DIRECTIVES

Confidential memoranda written by Mr. Hoover in August

and September, 1936,

clearly reveal that President Roosevelt was

very concerned about the subversive activities of fascists and

communists in the United States

and discussed the matter with

MI. Hoover during personal meetings.

These memoranda indicate

that President Roosevelt was obviously cognizant of the lack of

statutory authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations

of fascism

and communism.

Yet, the President desired the FBI to

conduct such investigations.

Mr. Hoover pointed out that the

FBI appropriation contained a provision for the FBI to conduct

investigations if such

matters were referred to it by the

Department of State.

The Presideni was hesitant of having a

formal request come through State Department, however, because

of the many leaks in the State Department.

However,

during a meeting between the President,

Mr. Hoover and the Secretary of State on August 25, 1936,

the

Secretary of State

did ask the FBI to conduct investigations of

"Fascist and Communist activities, under the provisions of the

Appropriations Act.

In the discussion preceding the request,

however, it must be noted that the

President stressed

the fact that

and communism were international in scope, and that

communism

in particular was directed from Moscow;

that this was a

which fell within the scope of foreign affairs over which

Department would have a right to request an inquiry to

be made.

According to the information presently available,

President Roosevelt agreed to place a handwritten memorandum of

his own in the White House safe, concerning the request of the

State Department for investigations of fascism and

President

communism.

asked Mr. Hoover to speak to the Attorney General

the matter and that the Secretary of State also discuss the

technique to be followed with the Attorney General.

Mr. Hoover

recorded that he did inform the Attorney General on September 10,

at which time the Secretary of State was

conference he had with the Presidont on soptember dames,

present, and at which

the Secretary of State - at the President' suggestion - requested

of Mr. Hoover to have investigations made of the subversive

activities in this country: including communism and fascism.

The Attorney General verbally directed Mr. Hoover to proceed

with

the investigations and to coordinate these matters in the

possession of the Military Intelligence Division, the Naval

Intelligence Division, and the State Department.

Mr. Hoover

considered this the authority upon which to proceed.

The circumstances surrounding the manner in which the

President had the State Department request investigation very

likely explains why the September, 1939, directive did not

any language relating to subversive activities.

President Roosevelt

was fully aware that the FBI was

already conducting confidential

investigations of the activities of fascists and communists who

represetned a threat to the national security at that time.

There

was obviously a private and understandable confidential agreement

between all interested parties, including the other Federal

investigative agencies who had an interest.

There was no need

to mention subversive activities

in the first part of the directive

since the pertinent Federal agencies were already on notice and

local agencies would turn over

all matters relating to the

national security.

Based on the foregoing, reliance on the September, 1939,

directive or even the carlier

confidential arrangement worked

out by the President, whether considered

a Presidential directive,

Presidential mandate, or some other manifestation of Executive

power, for current investigative authority appears to

Placing the 1930 directive and the earlier arrangement in their

proper perspective is very important. Both were laid in a period

when the world was on the brink of World War II.

The concern for

security was

related to two international movements. There

were no laws, such as

the Smith Act of 1940 or the Internal

Security Act

of 1950. Although there were undoubtedly some purely

American

groups which received no direction or control from abroad,

there was no national

cowarn for indigenous anarchists or other

groups desiring to overthrow the Government.

PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES SUBSEQUENT TO 1939

As mentioned previously, the directive dated

September 6, 1939, was reiterated subsequently by directives

dated January 8, 1943; July 24, 1950; and December 15, 1953.

The directive dated January, 1943, signed by President Roosevelt,

simply a reaffirmation of the

broadened only to

the extent that it called on all patriotic

organizations and individuals as well as local law enforcement

officers to report information to the FBI.

The July, 1950,

directive, signed by President Truman, contained the phrase

"subversive activities

and related matters," which on the

surface would indicate that President Truman intended to broaden

the scope..of authority it might convey to the FBI.

However,

closer examination reveals that the Truman. directive actually

misquoted the earlier two directives of President Roosevelt and

included the phrase

"subversive

which did not appear in the Roosevelt directives.

Since no information is available concerning Executive

intent behind the issuance of the 1950 directive, it cannot be

determined whether President Truman was aware of the possible

additional authority he might have conveyed to the FBi

result of changing the language of the two prior directives to

include the phrase "subversive activities and related matters."

The fact of the matter is, the United States was at the

time engaged in the "police action" in Korea and there

unquestionably a great deal of

domestic subversive activity

at the time, most of which could be traced to the Communist Party.

We do know that President Truman signed the 1950 directive

on the advice of the National Security Council.

There is one document available which tends to reveal

the concern President Truman had

relative to increased subversive

activity involving domestic cases.

In a letter dated July 17,

1946, the Attorney General said he felt that in the troubled

period in international affairs, accompanied by an

increase in

- 6.

HY 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 141

## Page 142

subversive activity at home, it was imperative to use special

investigative measures (wire taps) in domestic cases. Mr. Truman

concurred with the Attorney General and authorized the special

investigative measures.

There is one important point, however, which bears on

any feelings President Truman might have had on

the issue of

domestic subversive activity. When the Congress passed the

Internal Security Act of 1950, consisting of two subchapters,

Truman vetoed the bill, citing as a reason that Title II of

the Bill - The Emergency Detention Act - constituted a threat

democratic process.

In "The American Constitution

Its Origins and Development" by Alfred H. Kelly and Winfred A.

Harison,

the authors declared that President Truman roundly

condemned the Internal Security Act as grossly unconstitutional.

They said that his veto message called the registration provisions

of the law

greatest danger to freedom of press, speech

assembly since

the Sedition Act of 1798."

A drastic new sedition

statute, derived from the earlier Mundt-Nixon bill which was

up in

the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1948, was

incorporated in the Internal Security Act.

Mr. Truman thought

the phrase prohibiting a person to "substantially contribute"

to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship so vague as

to cast grave doubts upon whether it met the standards of accuracy

necessary for due process in criminal statutes.

did not even touch on the emergency detention subchapter of the

The political climate at the time, however, in spite of

President Truman's

censure and veto, was

such that the Internal

Security Act was passed

over the veto and became law.

While the 1950

directive of President Truman incorrectly

stated "On September 6, 1939, and January 8, 1943, a Presidential

Directive was issued providing that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation of the Department of Justice should take charge

of investigative work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,

subversive activities and related matters.," the directive issued

by President Bisenhower on December 15, 1953, said nothing about

the FBI being responsible for such matters.

Rather, the 1953

directive began by stating,

"On September 6, 1939, January 8,

1943, and July

24, 1950, Presidential Directives were issued

requesting all enforcement officers, both Federal and State,

to report promptly all information relating to espionage, sabotage,

subversive

activities,

and related matters

representative of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation."

This language can, of course, be interpreted to mean

that the FBI is responsible

for investigating these matters

otherwise the directive would not have noted that enforcement

officers were requested to furnish all information to the FBI.

- 7-

NH 55024 DocId: 32989609 Page 142

## Page 143

The 1953 directive actually did not reiterate either of the

three previous

directives

except for the language quoted above.

Instead, it cited the FBI's responsibility to investigate all

violations of the Atomic Energy Act and requested all patriotic

organizations and individuals as

well as all enforcement officers

to report violations of the Atomic Energy Act to the nearest

representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

IMPLEMENTATION OF 1939 DIRECTIVE

All of the foregoing documents have obviously been

subject to various interpretations.

However the language might

be interpreted, the September, 1939, directive, was implemented by

the FBI and Congress was made

fully aware of the extent of

investigative activity the FBI was conducting as a result of the

directive. In Mr. Hoover's testimony on November 30, 1939, in

connection with an

emergency supplemental appropriations bill,

he said,

"In September,

1939, we found it necessary to organize

a General Intelligence Division in Washington.

The establishment

of: this division was made necessary by the President's proclama-

tion directing that all complaints of violations of the national

defense statutes and proclamations be reported to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

This division now has compiled extensive

indices of individuals,

goups, and organizations engaged in

subversive activities, in espionage activities, or any activities

that are possibly detrimental to the internal security of the

United States.

"The indexes have been arranged not only alphabetically

but also geographically, so that at any time, should we enter

into the conflict abroad, we would be able to go into any of

these communities and identify individuals and groups who might

be a source of grave danger to the security of the country. "

During the same testimony Mr. Hoover was asked if any

of the funds being requested in the emergency supplemental

appropriation would be spent for any of the purposes for which

funds were denied at the previous session.

Mr. Hoover replied

they would not; that the entire sum would

be spent for intelli-

gence work.

Subsequently, in June, 1940, Mr. Hoover again testified

before a House Subcommittee on Appropriations.

time he

referred to his appearance before the committee the previous fall

wherein he testified that authority had been requested to set up

a separate division with the

FBI to handle national defense

matters under an

assistant director. Mr Hoover offered a chart

showing the organizational structure of five divisions of the

Bureau, one of which he referred to as the National Defense

Division.

He said

investigations dealing with espionage, sabotage, national defense

matters, and violations of neutrality statutues.

## Page 144

Mr.. Hoovex testified that in line with the President's

order of the previous September (September 6, 1939) there had

been close coordination

ot all the intelligence services. Me

pointed out that the President, on September 6, directed the FBI

to coordinate the functions on

national defense

matters in

intelligence work.

Mr. Hoover also related that he wanted to

refer to

general intelligence index which

mentioned in

previous hearings.

He said that that index included the names

of persons who might become potential enemies to our national

security,

espionage agents, known sabotuers,

members of the Communist Party,

and the bund.

explained that this index had been compiled very carefully, and

confined

solely to persons engaged in activities detrimental

to the United States.

Later,

on February 19, 1941, when Mr. Hoover appeared

before Congress in connection with a deficiency appropriations

bill for 1941, he went into some

detail concerning the activities

of the FBI prior to the then national emergency.

In response to

a question concerning this, Mr. Hoover replied that prior to the

emergency our activities

covered

genexally the investigation of

all Federal statutes except counterfeiting, narcotics. income

tax, and postal violations.

jurisdiction, he said, included

kidnaping, extortion, bank robbery, white slavery, motor vehicle

theft, impersonation of Government officers, frauds against the

Government, antitrust investigations, etc.

Mr. Hoover then incorporated into the record a list of

major crime laws passed between 1934 and 1941, showing the

legislative jurisdiction of the FBI during the period.

exception of nine of these laws, all dealt with

criminal-type

violations of law.

The exceptions included a prohibition on

exportation of arms

and ammunition to Spain during the civil

war; the prohibition of making photographs, sketches or maps of

vital military and naval defense installations; the Hatch Act,

which among other things related to employment of individuals by

the Government who were members of political parties advocating

the overthrow of the Government; amendment of the act requiring

registration of agents of foreign principals; the Neutrality Act

of 1939;

amendment of the Espionage Act; the Smith Act of 1940;

act requiring registration of certain organizations (Voorhis Act);

amendment to the Sabotage Act.. There was a special note

listed under the amendment of the act requiring registration of

agents of foreign principals.

This called attention to the Presidential

dixective dated September 6, 1939. From this structure inference

can be drawn that the directive was related to this amendment.

EXPANSION OF AUTHORITY CONTAINED IN 1939 DIRECTIVE

Further in his testimony Mr. Hoover was asked if any other

agencies of the Government were covering the same work that

emergency employees of the FBI were covering.

He replied that

he would like to leave the committee a publication listing the

statutes, proclamations

and Executive Orders pertaining to

national defense matters.

He then stated that the President in

1939 directed that all invest ations dealing with espionage,

sabotage, subversive activit.

and national defense

activities,

would be handled by the FBI "..ept those arising within the

Army or Navy.

He went on to say that other governmental agencies

were instructed under this Executive order to report to the FBI

any information showing any violation dealing with national

defense matters.

No Executive Order could be located which contains

language used by Mr. Hoover in this instance.

broader than used in either of these documents.

In considering the

full impact of the June and September,

1939, Presidential directives,

and how they subsequently influenced

jurisdiction and responsibility, it must be borne in mind

the Nation was at the very brink of World War II.

President

Roosevelt issued

a proclamation on September 8, 1939,

declaring

that state of national emergency existed in connection with the

observance, safeguarding, and enforcement of neutrality, and

strengthening of the national defense within the limits

of peace-

time authorizations.

An Executive Order (No.8233) dated September 5,

1939, prescribed regulations

governing the enforcement of the

neutrality of the United States.

The War Department, Navy Department,

Treasury and Commerce Departments, and the Governor of the Panama

Canal were

assigned certain enforcement duties.

The Justice

Department (FBI) was given responsibility of enforcement of the

neutrality of the United States not especially designated to other

departments, independent offices and establishments of the

United States Government, and prosecution of violations of the

neutrality of the U.S.

Unquestionably in time of national emergency the broadest

possible interpretation was being applied to every statute, resolu-

proclamation, Executive order, Presidential directive or other

lawful order or mandate in the interest of the preservation of peace,

the national

defense and

general welfare of the

country. Undoubtedly

there are many other documents recording Executive intention,

Executive instructions concerning broad, sweeping authority for the

FBI, which cannot now be found for one

reason or another.

Certainly

there is indication that

at least President Roosevelt had more than

one conversation with Mr. Hoover concerning the necessity for the

-FBI to conduct investigations beyond the statutory authority it

normally used.

Following the September, 1939, directive, which has

been used as a source of FBI authority to conduct certain types

of domestic intelligence investigations, the Smith Act of 1940

Several successful prosecutions resulted

although

some paris of it were invalidated

Supreme Court.

The revised statute (Title 18, U.S.C. 2385) remains

on the books

and is enforceable.

Legal Counsel's Office

analyzed Title 18, USC 2385,

in June, 1972. It was noted that this statute contains the

substance of the original Smith Act.

The House of Representatives

Committee on Judiciary, Report No. 1869, 74th Congress,

First Session, made clear the purpose of the original legislation:

reported bill is based on the natural right of

self-preservation inherent in every

government. It simply

authorizes

exercise of the power of the government to defend

itself against those who

seek by force and violence

destroy

it."

Further clarification of the legislative objective was

made by Representative John W. McCormack, who said,

"And by

the way, this bill is not alone aimed at

communists; this bill

aimed

anyone who

advocates the overthrow of government

by violence and force."

VALIDITY OF THE SMITH ACT

The Supreme Court held in 1951 that teaching the

doctrine of forcible overthrow of the United States Government

was a violation of the Smith Act where there was a clear and

present danger that a substantial public evil would result.

The Court

further held

that the Act did not violate the First

Amendment.

Chief Justice Vinson, who wrote the majority opinion,

used language which must be considered at this time to be

significant in deciding whether the Government may in

fact conduct preventive-type investigations in the interest

dion ..

of self preservation.

- 11 -

NN 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 146

## Page 147

Justice Vinson wrote, "The rule we deduce from these

(a series of earlier Supreme Court decisions - namely the

'question in every case is whether words used are used in such

circunstances and are of such nature as to create a clear

present danger that they

will bring about the substantive

evils that Congress has

a right to prevent.') is that where

"offense is specified by a statute in nonspeech or nonpress

conviction

relying upon speech

or preSS

as evidence

of violation may be

sustained only when

the speech or publication

created a 'clear and present danger' of attempting or accom-

plishing the prohibited crime."

In this case, applying this rule, the court said,

"Obviously, these words cannot mean that before the Government

may act, it must wait until the putsch is about to be executed,

the plans have been laid,

and the signal is awaited--we must,

therefore,

reject the

contention that success or probability

success

is the criterion."

In addition to the Smith Act of 1940, Congress also

passed legislation which

further increased the

authority of

the FBI to

deal with subversive activities. The Voorhis Act

(superseded in 1948 along with original Smith Act) which is

Title 18,. USC 2386, provided for registration of organizations

subject to

foreign

control which

engage in political activity

among other things. The Internal Security Act of 1950 was

passed over the veto of President Truman and provided not only

a prohibition of conspiracies or attempts to establish a

totalitarian dictatorship

and a long list of measures having

with Communist organizations

(Control of Subversive

Activities) but also for the emergency detention of suspected

security risks.

Further, in 1954, Congress

enacted the Communist

Control Act to

provide additional

investigative authority in

dealing with the communist threat to national

security

DIRECTIVES VERSUS LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENT

These legislative enactments were unquestionably

designed to give the FBI a cloak of statutory authority to

investigate not only the communists, which were a grave concern

to President Roosevelt when he requested investigations of

communism by the FBI in 1936, but also any other group which

engages

in activity aimed at

overthrow of the Government by

force or violence.

And, whereas President Roosevelt relied

on the element of

foreign relations

and the international

character of the fascist and

communist movements to have

State Deparment make a request for FBI investigation, the

statutes referred to above do not require a dependence on

foreign elements, notwithstanding the

congressional finding

of necessity in connection with the Internal Security Act of

1950 and the Communist Control Act of 1954.

The question to be resolved, then, is divided into

several interrelated parts.

First, if the Presidential

directives described heretofore are actually valid. Secondly,

assuming that the directives are

completely valid, why have

they been cited as one of the bases of FBI investigative

authority? Thirdly, if, as it appears from the foregoing, the

directives are valid, but do not

convey the investigative

authority we have heretofore contended, what effect will this

have on our past and future domestic intelligence investigative

activity?

Insofar as the validity of the Presidential directives

is concerned, there can be no question but that each directive

was issued completely in accord with the President's executive

The evidence shows that the first directive in September, :

1939, was not only implemented with the knowledge of Congress,

but by appropriating money to the FBI for its implementation

Congress in effect gave the directive the full force of law.

None of the directives from September, 1939, to the one issued

by President Eisenhower

in 1953 have been secret.

a matter

of fact, all were directed to the public at large,

support of local law

enforcement officials and patriotic

organizations.

Numerous times the directives have

been cited

in FBI appropriations testimony.

The second part of the question becomes more difficult

to answer.

Over the years, whenever it has been necessary and

proper to

describe our investigative authority, and this has

been a requirement in justifying our annual budget, we have used

what we have considered all of the different bases

for such

authority.

Although it now seems obvious that the September,

1939, and July, 1943, directives did not actually order the FBI

to take

charge of any investigations not actually covered by

statute, i.e.,

espionage, sabotage, and neutrality laws, it did

enforcement

officers

to turn over to the nearest

representative of the FBI all information relating to subversive

activities and

counterespionage as well as the three statutoxy

crimes listed.

It is apparent that the language here was intended

as a catch-all so that law enforcement officers would turn over

information of any sort whatsoever if it might affect the

national security.

In analyzing the language used in that first directive

of September, 1939, everything must be put into its proper

perspective.

In 1939 the Nation had been conditioned to a state

of near-war. From. January 30, 1933, when Adolf Hitler became

Chancellor

of Germany, through the nonagression pact between

Germany and the Soviet Union in August, 1939, the specter of war

- 13-

## Page 149

hung

over America.

Anti-German, anti-Italian

and anti-soviet

sentiment swept over the country. People began to look for spies

under their beds.

It became very necessary to direct the

Nation's

energies in that regard into a single channel:

We could

not have every police officer, sheriff and special deputy sheriff

in the country running around

investigating spies. By the same

token, it was very necessary for the Government's

resources to be

directed towards identification

and neutralization of very real

espionage rings and potential saboteurs.

The June, 1939, directive

assured that the FBI would take charge of domestic internal

security instead of several

agencies

working at cross purposes.

The September, 1939, directive placed local

law enforcement.on

notice and simultaneously provided for information of possible

value to be funneled to the FBI which was responsible for the

coordination and investigation.

The September,

1939, directive, although not conveying

any investigative authority to the FBI, did result in an

additional workload for the FBI by virtue of the fact that local

police and other Federal

agencies were referring matters to the

FBI for investigative attention which were not previously called

to our attention.

While some of the matters could be logically

fit into one of

the statutory crimes of espionage, sabotage or

neutrality regulations, others could not be since

the original

information was often nonspecific or so nebulous that it could

be categorized only after some

inquixy was made locally.

We were also faced with the reality of war and the

fact that Germany, Italy, Japan

and the Soviet Union had espionage

apparatuses

directed against the United States. While we might

not ordinarily institute an investigation before the commission

of a crime,

the case of a bank robbery, motor vehicle

theft, etc., the crimes of espionage and sabotage relate to the

national security.

It would have not only been folly, it would

have been insane

to wait until we had evidence of the commission

of crimes of espionage or sabotage.

Rather than wait until

a complaint alleging the commission of one of these crimes

we went out and conducted intelligence-type investigations to

determine if there were espionage rings operating or if

were persons conspiring to sabotage the national

defense.

So the

September, 1939, directive did affect our investigative operations.

Not by giving us some new investigative authority, but by assigning

us the responsibility of coordinating all investigative activity

in this regard. We were, of course,

already in the intelligence

gathering business as a result of the confidential arrangement

agreed upon in August and September, 1936, among

President Roosevelt, Director Hoover, and the Secretary of State.

- 14 -

HH 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 149

## Page 150

Fox these reasons, it can be seen why the FBI

used the

September, 1939, directive as one of the bases for its investi-

gative authority. The unfortunate thing is that the 1939 directive

was never really updated, in spite of the

reiterations of 1943,

1950, and 1953.

It was

Executive

really never broadened to incorporate the

request made in 1936, and to reflect the Executive

intent that became so obvious in the succeeding years up to this

very time.

It would be very difficult to convince

someone

examining our legal authority for conducting intelligence-type

investigations that we derive any authority, particularly any

?

reiterating it.

What we have, it appears, is

a hold-over or

perpetuation of a concept of authority (or better, responsibility)

which had some basis in

1939, and perhaps even through the

Korean War years, but which has long since ceased to have any

bearing on FBI investigative operations.

leads us to the third part of the question and

that is what effect the lack of authority derived from the

directives will have on past and

future domestic intelligence

investigations. Although there is division of opinion by some

supervisors and officials in the Domestic Intelligence Division as

to how much investigative activity has in the past and will in

the future depend on the nebulous authority of the directives

in question, examination of all the evidence leads to the

conclusion that in the past our investigations have to some

degree depended, not on

the language of any of the directives,

but rathers

the Executive request of President Roosevelt in

1936 andon basic authority derived from the many statutes.

relating to the national security, both before and after the

issuance of all the directives in question.

INVESTIGATIONS UNDER STATUTORY AUTHORITY

Argument has been advanced by some in the Domestic

Intelligence Division that it will be impossible to carry out

our internal security responsibilities of conducting purely

intelligence-type investigations using statutory authority only;

that the only way we have been able to do this in the past was

from the authority contained in one or more of the directives

in question. If this were true, i.e., that we have conducted

some investigative activity solely

the basis of the directives,

the FBI would be in

for a rough time if the efforts on the part

of several congressional figures to look into our operations

ever come to pass.

The fact of the matter is, we have had

ample authority to do just what we have done without the

directives.

Administratively perhaps, we

could have been more

precise in advertising our investigative jurisdiction and

authority. And unquestionably, we could have been more careful

in writing reports

and other records of our investigative

activity

to show that our investigations were predicated on information

indicating violation or possible violation of statutes.

This brings

up another point mentioned by

• Professor Elliff in his study.

Elliff related that

had a policy from Mr. Hoover's appointment as Director

until 1936 of "closed end" investigations, but that this policy

gave way to intelligence coverage involving continuing investiga-

rive activity within a broad range of delegated authority. By

"closed end" investigations, Elliff means that a crime was

committed, a prosecutive opinion was received, an investigation

was conducted, a prosecutive opinion was sought and the case

was either prosecuted

or closed for want of prosecution.

the other hand, an intelligence-type investigation would involve

continuing investigation without any thought of closing the

case by virtue of prosecution or inability to prosecute.

a case involving a purely criminal act, it can be seen that

a "closed end" investigation is possible. But in the fast-moving

world of today, with its organized crime problem tied into space-

age concepts even in purely. criminal cases,

the "closed end"

investigation is often far from a reality.

PREVENTIVE INVESTIGATIONS

In analyzing. the concept of "closed end" investigations

versus continuing intelligence-type investigations, several

factors must be considered, especially where the national security

is involved.

Ordinary criminal acts such as the bank robbery,

burglary, fraud, etc.,

can in no way be compared to crimes

involving the national security.

Usually we would have no

occasion to conduct investigation prior to the commission of any

of the above-named crimes.

But, a crime against national security

entirely different matter.

No one but a fool or one

dedicated to the destruction of democracy would advocate that the

Government take no action to prevent a crime which could destroy

the Government. In other words, it would be an unusual case to

conduct a "closed end" investigation of an attempt to overthrow

the Government by force

and violence.

It would appear that the

FBI would have a constitutional obligation to conduct the

necessary preventive investigation

(intelligence?) to insure that

an attempt to overthrow the Government does not occur.

Taking into consideration that any court in the land

would take judicial notice that the Soviet Union and its satellites

are engaged in espionage directed against the United States and

that it employs intelligence-gathering techniques against us, it

logically follows that the same courts would take judicial notice

that the United States Government would have to employ counter-

espionage and counterintelligence methods to combat this threat.

It is believed that the same can be said for other situations where

are such to lead any prudent and cautious individual to

believe that a threat exists to commit sabotage; to incite to

- 16=

• HH 55021 DocId:32989609 Page 151

---

## Page 152

insurrection or rebellion; to engage in seditious conspiracy; or

to plot the overthrow of the Government.

Under such circumstances

it would seem that the FBI not only has

the duty to conduct

investigations to prevent the crimes, but has the obligation to

to neutralize such

threats.

It is true that this type of investigation might be

contrary to the established concept of investigating only after

there is evidence of crime.

It is also true that such investi-

gations might take place over

a long period of time without any

indication or prospect of presecution.

However, as pointed out

by legal Counsel in his memorandum dated 7/14/72 on Wiretapping,

that "Running through the whole (decision) is a golden thread

of philosophy that when the functions essential to the preservation

of a nation itself are at stake, the nation has the power to take

the action reasonably necessary

to protect itself."

While this

comment had to do with a particular court decision not related

to the national secuirty, it is very apropos.

It would be

unrealistic to contend that the FBI could only investigate

or potential crimes affecting the national security

after

the crime has been committed. How ludicrous this would be.

Right on point in this regard is another part of the

majority opinion upholding the Smith Act convictions in 1951.

Chief Justice Vinson wrote, "Likewise we are in accord with...

the trial court's finding that the requisite danger existed. The

mere fact that from the period of 1945 to 1948 petitioners'

activities did not result in the attempt to overthrow the

Government by force

and violence is, of course, no

answer to the

fact that there was

group that was ready to make the

attempt.

The formation by petitioners of such a highly organized

with rigidly disciplined members

conspiracy,

subject to call when the leaders,

these petitioners, felt the time had come for action, coupled with

the inflammable nature of the world conditions, similar uprisings in

other countries,

and the touch-and-go nature of our relations

countries with whom

the petitioners were in the very least

ideologically attuned, convince us that their convictions were

justified on this score.

"And this

analysis disposes of the contention that a

conspiracy to advocate,

as distinguished from advocacy itself,

cannot be constitutionally restrained, because it comprises only

the preparation.

It is the existence of the conspiracy which

creates the danger. (Emphasis mine) If the ingredients of the

reaction are present,

we cannot bind the Government to wait until

the catalyst is

added."

Some might say, "this is all very well and good where

prosecutive action is used or intended, but what of the cases

where the only purpose of the investigation is to produce

intelligence information, with no hope or intent of prosecutive

action?"

would be impossible, but it is doubtful if any situation could be

conjured up involving the national security where the elements of

one or more

statutes would be present to lend statutory authority?

to an investigation or reason for investigation.

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

Recently, in connection with

a lawsuit filed by the

Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee because of investigation

by the FBI relative to

a huge demonstration in Washington, D. C.,

the Department of Justice cited Title 28, USC 533, as the

authority of the FBI

conduct the investigations in question.

The investigation at issue had to do with

contacting various

transportation facilities in an effort to determine the nature

and size of

groups traveling to Washington for the demonstration.

In a sense, this

was purely intelligence-type

investigation.

statute cited was nothing more than the statute enabling the

Attorney General to direct the FBI io conduct investigations.

This same statute has been cited

for other types of

investigations where the Department of Justice has requested the

conduct investigations

where we might not have

clearly

seen or understood the underlying authority or reason. It can be

seen, however, that under the statutory authority granted to the

President in Title 10, USC 331-333, to call up troops io assist

local

governments to put down

an

insurrection or restore order,

the Attorney General would be within his statutory authority as

the President's Chief Legal Advisor to ask the FBI to provide all

possible information which might assist the President in making a

determination under Title 10. Thus, the FBI would conduct an

intelligence-type investigation under the statutory and constitu-

tional authority

flowing from the President, through the

Attorney General to the FBI.

In this case we might not immedi-

ately see the potential for prosecutive action, although with the

statutes covering antiriot and

civil disorder we would no doubt

be alert for indications that riots

or disorders would occur

and that evidence could be collected which would support prosecur

Here, we would be conducting investigation before a

violation takes place, not only for the intelligence data needed

by the President, but to determine if a Federal violation of law

EXECUTIVE ORDER 10450

What other authority is also available to the FBI?

We

sometimes lump Presidential directives and

Executive orders into

one category as if they were the

same. This is a common practice,

- 18 -

HH 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 153

---

## Page 154

even on the Executive level.

The Executive orders are numbered,

whereas the directives usually are not.

From information

available it appears that Presidential directives and Executive

orders carry equal weight. They take on the force

of law if

acknowledged by resolution of Congress and are published in the

Register.

All this leads up to a very significant

document which over the years has provided substantial investi-

gative authority to the FBI.

It is commonly known

as Executive

Order 10450, although it has been revised and will be known

Executive Order 11605 if it is ever implemented. Executive

Order 10450 is captioned as

"Security Requirements for Government

Employment" and, as the name implies, is related to employment

by the Government of individuals who might constitute a national

security risk.

This Executive order grew out of Executive

Order 9835, dated March

21, 1947, which provided for an

investigative procedure affecting persons entering competitive

civil service.

The order established a Loyalty Review Board

and procedures for handling of cases where loyalty of an

employee was questioned.

Executive Order

followed the

establishment of the President's temporary commission on loyalty

under Executive Order 9086, dated November 25, 1946. Executive

Order 10450, dated April 27, 1953, superseded

Executive Order 9835.

The important

thing about these two Executive orders is

that the Attorney General was

required to furnish the Loyalty

Review Board current information concerning the subversive nature

of foreign or domestic organizations, including totalitarian

Thus, the FBI, acting under

lawful authority of the

Attorney General, was bound to conduct the necessary investiga-

tions to enable the Attorney General

to fulfill his responsibility

to the Loyalty Review

Executive Oxder 10450, in revoking

Executive Order 9835, also disbanded the Loyalty Review Board

and provided that the Attorney General would furnish the same

information regarding

subversive organizations to the head of

each department and

agency.

The

Attorney General was also

requested to render to the heads

of departments and agencies

advice as may be requisite to enable them to establish and

maintain an appropriate employee-security program.

Under Executive Orders

9835 and 10450. the

Attorney General had the responsibility to designate

organizations as totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive,

having adopted apolicy. of advocating or

approving the

commission of acts of force or violence to deny others their

rights under the Constitution of the United States, or as seeking

to alter the form of government of the United States by uncon-

stitutional means. Under provisions of Executive Order 11605,

- 19 -

HH 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 154

---

## Page 155

dated July 2, 1971, the Attorney General still has the

responsi-

bility of furnishing names of organizations to

the heads of

departments and agencies. However, instead of the organizations

being designated by

Attorney General, the new Executive

Order provides

that the Subversive Activities Control Board

shall, upon petition of the Attorney General, conduct hearings

to make the same

determination formerly made

by the

Attorney General.

The

new Executive Order also sets

up a much

broader criteria

for establishing the subversive nature of

organizations.

Unfortunately, the Subversive Activities Control

Board, which was initially established under the Internal Security

Act of 1950, is under attack from Congress.

Congress refused

to provide

any funds for the Subversive Activities Control Boaxd

after July 1, 1972. There has been indication that Congress may

also take steps to repeal the remnants of the Internal Security

Act of 1950.

Should this happen, we would lose a broad base of

current authority for conducting many of our security-type

investigations.

Executive Order 11605 has not actually been

implemented; therefore, we are bound to the provisions of

Executive Order 10450.

Basically, however, the responsibility

under 10450 (or even 11605 if it is ever implemented) falls on

the Attorney General,

and for this reason the Department of Justice

should now provide guidance as to what investigations are required

by the FBI to fulfill the Attorney General's obligations under

STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL POWER

What other investigative authority or jurisdiction do

we have? Attached to this study is a collection of statutes and

documents which

grant investigative authority for conducting the

various types of investigations falling with the primary

vision of the Domestic Intelligence Division.

collection of laws are statutes such as civil rights statutes,

which are the basic responsibility of the General Investigative

Division, but which nevertheless convey statutory authority in

Investigating totalitarian organizations

the Ku Klux Klan

and other hate-type

groups.

Civil rights statutes might also

likely be involved in other situations where organized

groups

act in such a manner as to deny other persons their constitutional

rights.

The fraud statutes are included since many groups

engage

in activities which are covered in one way or another

by such statutes.

There are, of course, the basic statutes such

as

But there are statutes, such as inciting to

and others which cover an extremely broad spectrum of subversive

activity.

But isn't there some additional authority under the

constitutional power of the President to protect the national

security?

It was under just

such constitutional powers that

President Roosevelt requested the FBI to investigate the fascist

and communist movement. And, of course, it was under just such

constitutional powers that the President authorized the

Attorney General to approve without a warrant electronic

veillances on both domestic and foreign organizations engaged

in activity detrimental

to the national security.

However, the

Supreme Court has considerably narrowed the President's

consti-

tutional authority as a result of the Keith case.

In essence,

the court stated that insofar as domestic organizations are

concerned, the President does not have the power

to abrogate

the First

and Fourth Amendments.

In other words, the President

cannot order an act (investigation) which would interfere with

abridge the First Amendment rights to assemble or redress

grievances, or to enjoy freedom of speech, or the Fourth Amend-

ment rights requiring the issuance of search warrant in connec-

the seizure of evidence.

The courts have considerably broadened their inter-

pretation of both the First and Foürth Amendments.

libertarians have proclaimed that any activity on the part of the

Government which might have a "chilling effect" on an individual's

legitimate right to dissent constitutes

a violation of First

Amendment rights.

In some cases the courts have adopted this

the same token, Fourth Amendment rights have been

broadened to include overhearings of conversation,

and the issue

of invasion of

privacy is being raised more and more.

being considered there are,

however, numerous

situations bearing on the national security where

the President

unquestionably has the constitutional authority to have the

FBI obtain information which will enable him to fulfill his

broad responsibilities under the Constituion. With the exception

of the recent Keith

decision, the courts have declined to define

or circumscribe the President's constitutional power.

Ordinarily, when we speak of the constitutional

power of the President we think in terms of a specific order

such as a directive or Executive order or some other tangible

evidence.

However, over the years, beginning with the years

preceding World War II, Mr. J. Edgar Hoover established a

rapport with the President which resulted in the President

making requests of the FBI under his inherent Executive authority.

The request made by President Roosevelt in 1936 as described

herein is an excellent example of a long series of Presidential

requests extending through a long line of Presidents and at least

until Mr. Hoover's death.

Presidents from Roosevelt to Nixon

confided in Mr. Hoover and

sought his advice and product of

FBI investigative skill, particularly in matters affecting the

national security. One very excellent example of the confidence

the President has

had in the FBl is the confidential Presidential

directive of 1941 instructing that the FBI set up a Special

Intelligence Service covering the Western

Hemisphere to handle

and coordinate all intelligence work within the hemisphere.

There are

many other

examples, but a more

recent one is the fact

that President Nixon, in spite of responsibility assigned to

CIA, asked that the FBI establish

Legal Attaches in several

countries where there had been a dearth of good intelligence

information.

SPECIAL WHITE HOUSE REQUESTS

Over

a period of years

the President came to rely on the

FBI to provide first-hand intelligence information concerning

both domestic and foreign situations bearing on policy affecting

the national security.

As a result of numerous conferences in

which the various Presidents outlined to Mr. Hoover their needs

for information which

assist him and his staff in their

policy decisions, Mr. Hoover instrucied that important developments

concerning the national defense or which might otherwise be of

value to the White House should be reported

directly to the

President or one of his high-level staff members.

instances the same information was made available to the Attorney

General simultaneously.

Over the years it became

a common practice

for White House staff members to telephone requests for information

or investigations to Mr. Hoover's office or the office of one of

his officials.

Such requests were usually considered as being

within the constitutional Executive power, and

the most part

requests were completely legitimate and well within the

recognized scope of the FBI investigative authority.

Occasionally, however, requests were made - and complied

with - which in

retrospect appear to have been beyond any recognized

Executive

authority.

An example is a telephone request to furnish

all available information to the White House concerning

a forth-

coming Earth Day rally in 1970. The rally, which was sponsored by

groups concerned with pollution and ecology, attracted the

attention of a few subversive elements, but

appeared to be very

much under the control of the sponsors.

Senator Edmund S. Muskie

spoke at the rally in Washington, D. C., and Rennie Davis, an

antiwar activist with a subversive

background, appeared on the

same platform with Senator Muskie. A few minor disturbances

erupted in some areas, but overall the Earth Day rallies were

peaceful and

attained their general objective, the calling of

attention to

environmental problems.

Muskie, who learned

that the FBI covered the rally in Washington, was incensed that

FBI was involved.

We had a poor defense

and in this case, at

least,

it is doubtful that there

was any legitimate Executive

authority to have the FBI involved. In any event, it would appear

that such requests should flow

through channels, including the

Department of Justice where possible, to assure that unreasonable

and improper requests are made for investigative activity.

It is quite understandable that various staff members

at the White House have assignments or projects to prepare

reports on a wide variety of matters relating to the welfare

of the country.

It is

also quite understandable that such

individuals would turn to the FbI to develop information through

investigative activity or from its

files.

However,

the fact that

the FBI has specific responsibilities and jurisdiction under

the law may not be known to these staff members and in their

ignorance of the situation they could ask us to engage in activity

beyond the scope of our investigative authority.

Over a long period of time the FBI has disseminated

intormation directly to the White House as it was developed

when the information had a bearing on national defense or possible

foreign policy planning.

The White House has come to expect this

kind of rapid. dissemination.

Much of the information disseminated

has been of specific interest to the National Security Council

of which the President, Vice President and high level members of

his staff

are members.

Even though CIA has the basic responsibility

under the National Security Act of 1947 to coordinate all

intelligence data relating to national defense, the nature

rapid

changing situations makes it impractical

to disseminate all

important intelligence information to the National Security

Council

via CIA channels.

It is not believed

that the White House

• would sit still for the FBI cutting off dissemination on nationai

security information.

NEED FOR CURRENT EXECUTIVE ORDER

Dissemination, however, is but the product of investi-

gative activity:

The question, then, is not to whom we should

not disseminate, but rather when and when not should

we investigate. All of which leads to the issue of what consti-

tutes Executive or Presidential authority under the constituion,

and how can such a determination be made? Granting that the

President does have broad constitutional powers which he can

exercise in the interest of national

security, how

can

such

power be conveyed to the FBI to cover possible

gaps in

our

statutory authority? It is not believed that individual requests,

particularly from lower

level White House staff members, actually

convey

any power of inherent Executive authority,

unless

such

requests may have originated from the President himself.

What appears to be sorely needed, then, is a clear-cut

memorandum

of understanding - possibly in the form of a comprehensive

order or Presidential directive - outlining areas of

investigative activity required and the investigative product

needed by the Executive to fulfill his national

security

responsibilities.

DEVELOPMENT OF INVESTIGATIVE POLICIES

By examining our investigative policies and procedures

over the years

readily be seen that procedures

adopted

out of necessity, such as those developing

out of the period

preceding World War II, in time come to be accepted as gospel

both within and outside the FBI.

The intelligence-type investi

gations originally ordered because of circumstances existing in

1936 and even before, continued

after World War II, and in reality

became necessary again during the Korean War period. And although

actual basis of authority in 1949 and 1950 was not the same

as in 1936, we evidently considered it the same and obviously the

Department of Justice and White House did also. Even though the

Congress provided legislative authority to investigate subversive

acts, it appears that we did not feel that the type of investi-

gations necessary could be conducted except under an authority

which did not require collection and preservation of evidence

with

a view of eventual prosecution, but rather to gather information

only for the purpose of determining the nature and extent of

subversive activity.

This is not to imply that the statutes were not used.

On the contrary, the statutes were used and a large number of

top level Communist Party functionaries were convicted under the

Smith Act, but we still conducted investigations based on what

we considered to be authority under constitutional power of the

President - investigations which Professor Elliff has called

continuing investigative activity within a

broad range of delegated

authority.

While this study has not gone into the procedures

and policies developed by the FBI in connection with investiga-

tions relating to our Emergency Detention Program, various

documents were examined and it is known that this

program preceded

the Emergency Detention Act, which was a part of the Internal

Security Act of 1950.

great deal of investigative activity,

dating back to the 1930's, was conducted concerning the Security

Index, an integral

part of the Emergency Detention Program. as a

matter of interest, the Emergency Detention Program, which was

a program devised

to insure that individuals constituting a

threat to national

security would be arrested and detained in the

of a national emergency.

The Department at one point felt

that the constitutionality of

such a program was highly question-

However, the program was implemented and was in existence

at the time the Internal Security Act of 1950 was passed.

And most curiously of all is the fact that even

the Internal Security Act of 1950 became law, providing a legal

basis for the program in

existence, it was not until the 1960's

that our Emergency Detention Program was switched over from an

emergency plan under Presidential powers to the authority

vested by statute. Of course, the part of the Internal Security Act

- 24 -

HH 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 159

## Page 160

authorizing emergency apprehension and detention was repealed

in October, 1971.

Under the Emergency Detention Program, while

it existed, a great deal of continuing investigative. activity

conducted concerning thousands of individuals who were

believed to represent a threat to the national security in time

of national emergency. Some of our investigative practices today

are based on criteria authority growing out of the original

Emergency Detention Program.

Now this is

not to say that the FBI is in a position of

having to defend its investigative policies or practices.

If there

been but a single thread of continuity running through our

investigative practices

and procedures over the years it is that

the individual's constitutional rights are paramount; that nothing

is so important as a citizen's rights under the law.

Counsel

pointed out an extremely important point last year

time of the Princeton Conference where a group of FBI critics

gathered to expose the FBI's faults.

He noted that for years

preceding the Miranda decision and the Escobedo decision the FBI

had been warning persons of their rights prior to taking any kind

of statement.

Every Special Agent knows that the first and

perhaps most

important element in preparing for a prosecution is

preserve the individual's rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

The

FBI has legally conducied investigations of individuals

and organizations whose philosophies include the overthrow or

destruction of the United States Government by force or violence.

Whether conducted under a Presidential order or statutory

authority any such investigations were absolutely necessary and

continue to be so. For administrative reasons documents reporting

xesults of investigations often have not always clearly shown the

authority, statutory or otherwise. A caption has usually been

used for routing and supervisory purposes which is not clearly

indicative of the nature or purpose of the investigative activity.

such captions

might well be confusing to one not connected with

the FBI and they might well lead to the conclusion that investi-

gation was not based on any legal authority.

For example, the

caption

"Security Matter - Miscellaneous" or "Internal Security

Revolutionary Activity" means little to

someone outside the FBI.

To those in the Domestic Intelligence Divison such designations

identify the type of case and supervising unit at Headquarters.

In other words, there has been nothing wrong with the

.conduct of our investigations.. Only those deserving of investi-

gation under statutory provisions have been investigated.

we would have been more precise to predicate our investigations on

a specific authority, whether

statutory or Executive order (10450),

we have not engaged in extra-legal investigative activity

simply because we failed to cite any specific authority to

conduct the investigation in such

a way as to make it

a "closed

end" investigation such as Professor Elliff described.

PREVENTIVE INVESTIGATIONS

While there has been some disagreement by one or two

supervisory personnel in Domestic Intelligence Division

as to

how long an investigation may be carried on under statutory

authority or whether a "preventive" investigation can be carried

on under that authority, it is my own contention that intelligence-

type investigations can

be carried out under statutory authority;

that there is no constraint imposed by law governing the length

of time in which

an investigation can be conducted.

There are

many reasons why continuing investigative activity would be

necessary,

even when a statutory violation is involved.

cases involving the national security a conspiracy of some sort

is involved. Conspiracies frequently go on for years. When

the preservation of the

Government is involved, who is to say that

we either prove a conspiracy within a specific

period of time or

stop investigating.

Whether a conspiracy is evident or not, the FBI would not

an investigation of

any type unless information was first

received that a violation of Federal law was involved or that the

national security was threatened. This is how our so-called

intelligence-type investigations

are usually started.

A citizen,

an informant, or a law enforcement officer furnishes information that

there is a group in existence which includes in its philosophy an

advocacy of overthrow or destruction of the Government of the

United States by force or violence. It would appear to be entirely

logical that under at least three separate Federal statutes a

violation would occur if this group did attempt to overthrow the

Government. And the Supreme Court has said that the Government

and that proof that success or probability of success must be shown.

While the examples cited hereafter might not be good legai

analogy, there does not seem to be any reason why the preservation

of our Government warrants any less consideration under the law.

The courts have upheld cases, such

as have been developed in the

Washington, D. C., metropolitan

area, where a nearby jurisdiction,

which prohibits importation of liquor from Washington, sets up

surveillance near the larger purveyors of liquor.

When a car

bearing Virginia or Maryland license plates is observed to be

loading up

what is obvioulsy more

liquor than

can be imported into

states, a surveillance is instituted and when the

the state line he

is arrested and

charged with

violation of state liquor laws.

It can be argued that such is

possible only because of the

broad police powers delegated to

states by the Constitution.

Perhaps.

somewhere there is a rationale

that if a statute exists prohibiting the overthrow or destruction

of our Government, the Government

But the same problem exists in

many areas covered by

Federal statute.

In the narcotics field tremendous intelligence

programs

are in

existence to stop the spiraling increase in drug

addiction and traffic in narcotics by organized

crime.

Even

broader intelligence programs are being planned.

It is true that

occurring.

And some arrests

result of excellent police work following the violations.

the Government is also concerned with preventing drugs from even

getting into the United States,

and from preventing any that do

get here from being sold to our children.

So, we are conducting

preventive investigations in the narcotics field. We are conducting

intelligence-type investigations.

Certainly prosecutions will

be sought wherever possible, but we are conducting

the same type

of investigations in the narcotics area as we are in the field of

national

security.

statutes

We are doing what has to be done, and the

are the basis of what has to be done.

In the field of organized crime we know that the Mafia

and the Cosa Nostra have spread like a cancerous

growth

very economy of the Nation.

Certainly there

are violations of

law.

Statutes of some sort are usually involved. Many of the

statutes involved are outside the primary investigative jurisdiction

of the FBI.

What has to be done?

The individuals controlling

the organizations of crime syndicates must be identified and the

nature of their activity analyzed to see what - if any - Federai,

or even local,

crimes are being committed.

In other words, we

know that syndicated criminals

are engaged in crime, yet we do

not know exactly what crimes.

We are therefore conducting

intelligence-type investigations to first identify the criminal

and then identify the crime.

I fail to see why there isn't a

parallel between intelligence-type investigations conducted to

prevent criminal depredations on the public at large and the same

kind of investigations to protect the Nation from the nihilists,

anarchists, terrorists, revolutionaries and other subversives.

While drawing a parallel between criminal investigations

and national security investigations, there is no intent here to

show that both

types of investigative

activity can be or should be

conducted alike.

The two types of activity are as diametrically

opposed as the two poles of the earth. One is concerned with the

individuals and organizations which are involved purely for

financial

The other is concerned with

the individuals

organizations which are involved purely for ideological and

philosophical reasons.

There is

a vast difference between

Intelligence-type investigations are necessary in the

field of narcotics and other

areas of organized crime and they

are conducted without the need

for any inherent Executive power

being conveyed.

Oxders 9835 and 10450. Included in this group were (1) National

Association of Black Students

(NABS) which originally had as its

stated purpose to. serve as an information center and communications

network for blacks on college campuses.

This was in 1969.

There was an enormous

amount of violence and upheaval on college

campuses at that time.

Damage and injuries from arson, sabotage

and malicious vandalism grew

into the millions.

In a number of

instances black students

were in the center of the activity.

NABS was considered a potential source of danger during any

strife, particularly since the national coordinator of the

Gwendolyn Marie Patton, had been a member of

an extremist

group cited as an extremist group by the House Committee on

Un-American Activities.

The Black Panther Party and other

revolutionary-type organizations attempted to organize and

penetrate black student groups such as this.

(2) The Center for Black Education (CBE) came under

investigation when its founder was determined to be a former member

of the Black Panther Party and described as one of the leading black

militants in San Francisco prior to his move to Washington, D. C.

CBE has been publicly described as an educational institution

designed to train technicians who will work to liberate the

African people and develop the African world.

The CBE has as its

"the independence of the African People." Members have

engaged in firearms training.

The Drum and Spear Bookstore (DSB) in

Washington, D. C., opened in 1968 and was publicly described as

a retail bookstore having the largest collection of books about

Africa, Asia, and the Negro in America. It also had protest

and books concerning the socio-economic conditions in

the U. s.

It was determined through investigation that the

bookstore was apparently not being used as a front for underground

or subversive activity and investigation was closed.

(4) The Congress of African Peoples (CAP) was formed in

It initially advocated the unification of all blacks,

complete rejection of the

"white imperialist, capitalist system,"

the establishment of a black nation, the

formation of a National

African Party and ultimately a World African Party under the

revolutionary ideology of Pan-Africanism.

During a CAP conference in July, 1971, CAP leaders

vociferously

advocated the need

to engage in

disruptions

means of ending "acts detrimental to blacks," the formation

of a paramilitary "defense unit," and the establishment of

communication lines with other

black revolutionary movements

abroad. The CAP has established communication links with the

Chinese communist diplomatic

establishment in Canada.

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS AND CIVIL LIBERTY

One of the biggest distinctions between the criminal

and security-type investigations is the fact that national

security investigations, which involved the ideological factor,

are almost without exception concerned

with the concept of

political ideology.

No matter how radical the political ideology

might be, it is nevertheless considered by the people involved -

and often by many intellectual idealists - as a right guaranteed

under the Constitution.

As a result of a great deal of liberal

thinking on the part of the civil libertarians and groups such

the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), there is a much

greater hue

and cry when

intelligence-type investigations are

surfaced

and it developed that the purpose of the investigation

had something to do with an individual's so-called political

beliefs.

The potential problem

for the FBI in conducting purely

intelligence-type investigations: even when based on statutes,

the investigation broaches or gets real close to rights

protected under the First and Fourth Amendments.

As pointed out before, however, the Supreme Court has

emphatically stated that the President has no constitutional

power to abridge these two Amendments. Therefore, no Executive

order,

no matter how broadly worded to convey investigative

authority for intelligence- type investigations, could

enable the

avoid the same pitfalls regarding areas

of activity

covered by the Fiist and

Fourth Amendments.

Therefore, even though

a definitive Executive order would be desirable from the stand-

point of fixing our responsibilities and bridging any gaps between

statute and Executive necessity, the FBI would still be in a little

better position than it is at the present time under purely

statutory authority.

INTERPRETATION OF AUTHORITY BY SUBSTANTIVE SECTIONS

At this point it appears appropriate to introduce comments

offered by

representatives of the various substantive Sections of

the Domestic Intelligence Division

as to their interpretation of

Executive power flowing from the 1939 et seg, directives and

the types of investigative matters that possibly cannot be conducted

solely under statutory authority.

EXTREMIST INTELLIGENCE SECTION VIEWS

The Extremist Intelligence Section described four

investigative matters

where it appears that investigation, at

least initially, would not or could not have been grounded in

specific Federal statutes, but where the FBl nevertheless was in

a sense fulfilling intelligence responsibility tracing its

## Page 165

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

It is believed that in at least three of the above-

described situations the FBI

would have been able to conduct

investigatons based on statutes relating to advocacy of over-

throw of the Government, seditious conspiracy, inciting to

insurrection or rebellion, civil disorders,

antiriot,

neutrality laws (foreign relations)

and perhaps sabotage. The

questionable case, the Drum and Spear Bookstore, would have

probably been brought adequately to our attention from various

public sources or through our informant coverage of overall

matters affecting the national security.

NATIONALITIES INTELLIGENCE SECTION VIEWS

The Nationalities Intelligence Section listed four

situations wherein,

generally speaking,

much of the FBI's

investigative activity has not been based on statutory authority,

but has been designed to develop intelligence data regarding

individuals

and organizations which have established themselves

a potential threat to the security and safety of the

United States Government or its citizens. Listed

are the following:

The Jewish Defense League (JDL). Although involved

in terror-type bombings covered by statute, FBI investigation of

activities, particularly violent acts against Soviet diplomats

In the case of JDL, Department of State has a specific

interest from the standpoint of U.S. relations with other

countries.

Certain of our intelligence-type investigations of

JDL are aimed at satisfying State Department requirements.

Popular Front for the Liberation of

Palestine are two organizations that are well known for violence

potential.

In light of statements and actions of members

leaders, it is obvious that the FBI should conduct intelligence

investigations when these organizations are active in the U.s.

Revolutionary Union

and Venceremos Organization are

groups which adhere to

a pro-Chinese communist political

philosophy and pledge overt action through use of weapons to

bring about revolution in this country.

With this

in mind, we

have undertaken intelligence-type investigations to identify

those involved who may be responsible for

carrying out violence

against the U. S. Government or the citizens of this

country.

Puerto Rican independence groups, specifically those

who seek to bring about independent status for Puerto Rico by

of force and violence, are the subject of intelligence-

type investigations.

No groups seeking independence of Puerto Rico

by lawful means

are investigated. The violence-prone groups have

acts ranging from

attempted assassination of the President,

accompanied by murder, to acts of terrorism involving bombing,

arson, and shootings.

Much of the violence-prone groups' activity.

is planned in

communist Cuba.

Many of the leaders of the violent

pro-independence groups are communists

or followers of Leninist-

Marxist philosophy.

Nationalities Intelligence Section is of the opinion that

the aims and activities of the above-mentioned groups and similar

organizations border on

statutory violations; that while we do not

statutory

prohibitions for authority

to investigate them,

it must be recognized that the reason investigations are initiated

approaches

the elements involved in conspiracy violations.

Nationalities Intelligence Section opines that if we must 100k

authority for this kind of investigation,

it appears

we must rely on the Executive order (directive?) dated

September

6, 1939,

and subsequent reaffirmations of that order,

noting that

the 1939 directive and later supporting directives

published at a time when this country was involved in armed

hostilities

abroad.

Nationalities

Intelligence Section observed that it

order which

are clearly

opposed to the constitutional basis under which we operate and

those which, no matter how unpopular, are nothing more than an

expression of ideas.

Finally, Nationalities Intelligence suggests

guidelines from the Attorney General

should be

issued, based on the Executive order or directive.

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

While I agree completely with the suggestion that a

detailed Presidential order

is needed, along with guildelines

issued by the Attorney General, I disagree that we cannot investigate

the violence-prone

Puerto Ricans and the Revolutionary Union and its

spin-off,

the Venceremos Organization, under existing statutes.

for the

time being, in Executive Order

10450 (based on Executive Order 9835). Additionally, there

INTERNAL SECURITY SECTION VIEWS

The Internal Security Section pointed out that the

security investigations supervised within that Section are

conducted within the purview of authority set out in original

position paper of the Domestic Intelligence Divison dated

May 19, 1972, entitled "Investigations of Subversion," which

paper was to

been discussed during meeting of the Bureau's

Executive Staff with Mr. Gray at Quantico the last week of May.

The position paper was

abandoned by Mr. Miller in favor of a

different position, the essence of which has been expressed

in this study.

authority referred to by Internal Security Section

essentially is based on both statutory and Presidential documents,

including the 1939, et seq,

directives.

Internal Security pointed

out that it should be stated at the outset that while FBI

investigations conducted

with

specific refexence to a statute

will develop some intelligence it is not possible to base all FBI

activities in

collection of intelligence on statutory

authority alone.

Internal

security further points out that it is

true that the initial Presidential directive(s) of 1939 picked

up the term "subversive activities" as incidental to their

primary thrust, but that it is

as true that President Truman's

directive of July 24, 1950, however intentional or

unintentional it may have been specifically stated, said that the

FBI had charge of investigative work

in matters relating to

espionage, sabotage, subversive activities and related matters.

Internal Security feels that whether or not the initial Presidential

directives fully embraced the concept of subversive activities

would appear irrelevant after such a definitive order signed

by Truman. Internal Security Section is of the

opinion that whether

we had it spelled

out beforehand is unimportant because obviously

Truman's order of July 24, 1950, made our investigative interest

in subversive activities valid at that time.

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

Without going into detailed rebuttal here,

the Truman

directive is discussed in detail heretofore, it must be reiterated

that Truman's directive contained a misstatement of fact concerning

the previous directives, and I feel that under the magnification

of the Truman directive, particularly by

- 32-

NW 55021 DocId: 32989609 Page 167

---

## Page 168

individuals unsympathetic to the FBI, we cannot glibly state

that whatever the intention or unintention may have been, Truman

signed

the order and therefore it made everything fine.

VIEWS CONTINUED

The Internal Security Section believes that reliance on

statutory authority alone for the collection of intelligence

would severely limit the scope of FBI activities to the detriment

of our national security.

They feel that

a statutory basis must

impose reasonable and

definable limits and for the most part

investigations conducted with regard to statute are "closed end"

Internal Security points out that we investigate violations

or allegations of violaiions; that we do not

investigate indefinitely

on the supposition or speculation that by "fishing" we may

find sonebody who violates a Federal law. Internal Security notes

that such a concept is repugnant to the

democratic process

clearly indicates a police state mentality.

They go on to point

out that on the other hand it is also clear that there are some

- particularly where the integrity of the Government

stake -- where we must conduct intelligence-type investigations

to detect conspiracies and actual attempts which go to the very

heart of the Government's existence.

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

Here, again, I must interject with

a point of rebuttal.

As pointed out

before, I feel that investigation under

statutory

or other legal authority does not require the so-called "closed

end" type of investigation in every

But the most important

want to bring out is that I

cannot see the logic of saying

that investigations based on the possibility of violations to

destroy the Government (intelligence investigations actually)

are repugnant to the democratic process when performed under

statutes forbidding such activity and are indicative of a police

state mentality, whereas there is nothing repugnant, nothing

wrong with conduct the same type of investigations

under some

nonspecific Presidential power to protect the integrity of

the Government. I personally, as

a citizen, would rather

have a system wherein I could not be investigated unless there

was some indication that I was planning to violate

the Taw,

or had already done so.

As a law-abiding citizen I have no

fear of intelligence-type investigations aimed at discovering

plots to violate the law.

I would have fear of a government

which permitted intelligence investigations based on

someone's - anyone's: Presidential or otherwise - interpretation

of what an individual may say, do or think. The law is

guideline and states clearly what I may do or not do.

Vague interpretations subject to the caprices of undisciplined

politicians

could result in

a virtual police state if the law is

not the basis of our investigative activity.

## Page 169

VIEWS CONTINUED

Internal Security Section recognizes that our investi-

gations are conducted

under both the authority conferred

under

Executive orders (10450)

and statutes and notes that as

practical matter the statutory provisions cited as a basis for

intelligence-type investigative

authority must bear a reasonable

relationship to the activity investigated and must be brought to

a logical conclusion within a reasonable period of time.

also point out that it would be extremely difficult to justify

continued investigative interest in a mere member of the Communist

Party on the basis of the smith Act or the Internal Security Act

of 1950.

It is further pointed out that this points up again

the necessity for reliance not only on statutory authority but

for the broader. intelligence-type authority conferred by

Presidentail directives and Executive orders.

REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES SECTION VIEWS

The Revolutionary Activities Section furnished

several

specific examples of work of that Section which does not fall

within the purview of existing Federal statutes. Included in

those examples are the following:

(1) Students for a Democratic Society/Worker

Student Alliance (SDS/WSA) is the largest faction of SDS

in existence at the present time. It has an estimated

membership of 750 members. This

group is

described

tionary, predominantly campus-based organization dominated and

controlled by the communist Progressive Labor Party.

The group

has engaged in recent widespread

anti-Government demonstrations

throughout the country which have led to numerous arrests,

property damage, and

injuries to law enforcement officers.

purpose of our

investigation of SDS/WSA is to obtain intelligence

data in order to have a day-to-day appraisal of the strength,

dangerousness,

and activities of the organization and to keep

the Department. of Justice and

other interested agencies advised.

Revolutionary Activities Section states that authority

for investigation of SDS/WSA is based on Executive Order 10450,

but that additional authority is derived from

Presidential

directives dating from September 6, 1939, 28 Code of Federal

Regulations 0.85 (d) cites FBI authority

to carry out Presidential

directives.

They also note that "inherent" responsibility of the

President derived from the Constitution to linsure domestic

tranquility," (Preamble) to "take care that the laws be faithfully

(Article II, Section 3) and to protect the states

against invasion and domestic violence (Article IV, Section 4)

provide power to the President.

(2) The Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) is the inter-

national

Trotskyist movement founded in the 1920's when Leon Trotsky

lost out in a power struggle to

Joseph Stalin for control of the

international communist movement.

The basic philosophy of the SW

is that only violent revolution can

destroy capitalism; that

all political groups other than their own

are counterrevolutionary

and

must be destroyed.

We rely on Executive Order 10450 for

investigative authority.

(3) The Venceremos Brigade consists of a loosely knit

group of over 1500 individuals who have travelled to Cuba in

separate contingents since November, 1969.

Positive information

has been developed that the organization is being used by

various hostile intelligence services for spotting purposes

and recruitment of intelligence agents and support personnel.

group is under investigation because it appears to be under

control and domination of a hostile power.

Revolutionary Activities Section states that Presidential

directives (supposedly the 1939, et seq directives) have given

the FBI responsibility to investigate matters relating to the

internal security of the country.

They point out that after the

first contingent returned to the U.S. in

February, 1970, the

White House (nonspecific) instructed the Director

to conduct an

intensive investigation of the group to determine the extent of

indoctrination afforded these individuals while in Cuba and to

assess their potential dangerousness to the country. In addition,

the Department of Justice has requested information to support

indicia that members of various contingents have been trained as

espionage and intelligence agents for the Cubans and North Koreans

and may be operating as such in the U.s.

(4) Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) is a revo-

luationary antiwar group currently of major concern in view of

its potential for violence.

The organization is made up of many

Vietnam war veterans who have advanced training in explosives and

weapons and many have records of narcotics use.

One VVAW

national coordinator stockpiled arms and ammunition and advocated

"political elimination squads."

Revolutionary Activities Section

relies on the Presidential directives (1939 et seq) and Executive

Order 10450 as a basis for investigation in the absence of

specific statutory authority.

(5) Weatherman is the name adopted by a group which is

a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist organization dedicated to the

overthrow of the Government through force and violence. A number

of Weatherman leaders are current Bureau fugitives in connection

with violations of Federal antiriot laws, Bombing and Gun Law

statutes, as well as the fugitive Felon Act.

Revolutionary

Activities Section cites as specific authority for investigation

- 35 -

HW 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 170

---

## Page 171

of the Weatherman organization that Presidential directives have

instructed the FBI to take charge of investigative work

relating to espionage, sabotage and subversive activities and that

Executive Order 10450

provides additional authority.

(6) Unaffiliated individuals who are a part of the New

Left Movement.

Revolutionary Activities Section notes that

although the New Left Movement has no definable ideology of its

own, it does have strong Marxist, existentialist, nihilist

anarchist overtones.

In some instances there are individuals

without any organizational affiliation who by their revolutionary

activities and statements, establishing a rejection of law and

order, reveal the individual to be a potential threat to the

security of the U.s.

Such individuals do, in fact, engage in

violence or unlawful

activities and their potential dangerousness

to the internal security is clearly demonstrated by their state-

ments, conduct

and actions. According to Revolutionary Activities

Section, specific authority to conduct our investigations of

unaffiliated individuals is derived

Presidential directives

of September 6, 1939, through December 15, 1953.

This Section states that in all these examples there is

a likelihood that evidence may be developed

at some future date

that activities of these organizations and individuals constitute

violations of specific statutes.

It is further stated that our

authority io conduct investigations in these

cases cannot be

based on the speculation that evidence of some violation might be

developed; however, until such time as we obtain a substantial

allegation that a violation has occurred,

we must base our

"intelligence" investigations on the Presidential directives and

Executive orders issued by the President delineating oux

responsibility in regard to national security.

COMMENT - REBUTTAL

At the risk of being monotonous, there appears to be

ample indication here that a great deal of statutory authority

is present, but not being cited.

The Smith Act of 1940

other

statutes dealing with the national

security provide the basis for

investigating all of these

• groups.

The espionage statutes

serve

as basis for investigating

the Venceremos

Brigade.

Certainly

the authority conveyed by Executive Order 10450 is not questioned.

And in the case of the

Weatherman group, the Fugitive Felon

gives us a

tremendous latitude for conducting all the intelligence

investigation we may need in

an effort to locate the Weatherman

fugitives.

OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION

Although the cold facts indicate that the Presidential

directives dating back to 1939 do not convey any authority to

the FBI which

it did not have already by legislative enactment,

it is obvious

that intelligence-type investigations are necessary

in the protection of the national security.

Various documents

emphasize the necessity for developing intelligence data.

example, the report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil

Disorders

(Kerner Commission, 1968) emphasized that law enforcement

organizations must develop the means to obtain adequate intelligence

for planning purposes and that law enforcement. should "gather,

evaluate, analyze and disseminate information on potential as well

actual civil disorders."

Similarly, the President's Commission on Campus Unrest

(1970) took special

note of the need for intelligence in effective

law enforcement.

The Commission stated in its report, "It is

an undoubted fact that on some campuses there are men

and women

who plot, all too often successfully, to burn and bomb, and

to maim and kill."

The report concluded that

the

best, and sometimes the only, means law enforcement has to thwart

or prevent such plots is through "clandestine intelligence work."

A memorandum for the Director of the FBI from

Attorney

General Ramsey Clark, dated September 14, 1967, stated that "In

of the seriousness of the riot activity across the country,

it is most important that you use the maximum available resources,

investigative and intelligence, to collect and report all facts

bearing on the question

as to whether there has been or is a

scheme or conspiracy by any group of whatever size, effectiveness,

ox affiliation, to plan, promote or aggravate riot activity."

The memorandum

went on to state that "In this connection

the following federal statutes could be applicable depending, of

course, upon the factual situation that develops." Ten Federal

statutes were then listed and

it is particularly significant to

note that the Attorney General was instructing that the FBI

collect intelligence information - not on some specific allegation

that a crime had been committed, but to determine whether

has been or is a scheme or conspiracy. In other words,

the FBI

instructed by the Attorney General to conduct intelligence

investigations

to determine if any

of the ten Federal laws might have

been violated in connection with riot activity.

FORMER STUDY OF FBI'S INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

In an exhaustive study of the "role of the FBI in

Clandestine Foreign Intelligence Collection in the United States,"

conducted and reported in a document dated April 29, 1966, by.

a committee more commonly referred to as the "Papich

Committee"

- 37 -

HH 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 172

---

## Page 173

considerable information was brought out concerning the FBI's

investigative

National

securaty Act of 1947 eat

Of great interest is the impact the

on the gathering of intelligence

in the United States.

This Act, which is reported in 50 USC 401

et sed, established the National Security Council (NSC) and under

it the Centeral Intelligence Agency (CIA). The legislative

history of the Act notes the concern Congress had that CIA could

develop into a gestapo if permitted to become operational in the

James Forestal, then Secretary of the Navy, testified

a hearing before the

Committee on Expenditures in

the Executive

Departments, that "The purposes of the Central Intelligence Agency

definitely to purposes outside of this country, except

collation of information gathered by other government agencies."

He went on to say, "Regarding domestic operations, the

Federal Bureau of Investigation is working at all times in

collaboration with General Vandenberg (then head of CIA). He

relies upon them for domestic activities."

The Papich Committee

study noted that

there is tacit acknowledgement in Section 403 (e)

of the National Security Act of 1947 that the FBI gathers

information affecting the

national security:

"That upon the written

request

of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the

Director of the FBI shall make available to the Director of Central

Intelligence such information

for correlation, evaluation, and

dissemination as may be essential to the national security."

The Papich Committee report reveals that there is ample

indication that Congress was aware of FBI intelligence functions,

particularly with respect to

foreign intelligence activity in

the U.S. The Executive Branch was obviously depending on the FBI

to provide intelligence

data which CIA, by law, could not collect

in the U.S. A task force headed by General Mark Clark in 1955

took notice of the fact

that the FBI dealt in security intelligence.

The task force

report cited the fact that the FBI was one of

four members of the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IIC),

created by the National Secuirty Council, approved by the President,

March 23, 1949, to coordinate "the investigation of all domestic

espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related

matters affecting internal security."

It was noted that the IIC charter did not disturb

responsibilities of its member agencies but made mandatory

action by those agencies deemed necessary to insure complete

investigative coverage in

compliance with

the needs of the IIC,

which had full responsiblity for coordination of the investigation

of all domestic espionage, counterespionage, etc., affecting

internal security.

The task force mentioned

above, in commenting on the role

of the FBI, noted "The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however,

is the recognized center of the domestic aspect of internal

security including counterintelligence within the United States

and. its possessions."

It is to be noted that this task force took

- 38-

HH 55024 DocId: 32989609 Page

173

---

## Page 174

cognizance of the fact that President Roosevelt as far back as

1939 had directed the FBI to coordinate and conduct domestic

counterintelligence activities. (Underlined part taken

Papich Committee report and is not necessarily the actual language

used in the task force

report.

In any event, we know this is a

very broad interpretation of the 1939 directive.)

RECENT EXECUTIVE INTENT

Even more recently the White House exhibited its own under-

standing of the intelligence role and functions delegated to the

Attorney General and the FBI.

By confidential memorandum from

the White House to the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury and

Commerce; the Attorney General; Director of CIA; Military Represen-

tative of the President; Administrator, Federal Aviation Agency;

and Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, dated June 9, 1962

(National Security Action Memorandum 161), President Kennedy

stated that he

would look to the

Attorney

General to take the

initiative in the Government in insuring the development of

programs,

and action proposals to protect the internal security

of the United States.

memorandum directed that the two

interdepartmental committees

concerned with internal security --

the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (Chaired by J. Edgar

Hoover)

and the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security

(Chaired by a representative of the Department of Justice) which

had been under the supervision of the National Security Council,

be transferred to the supervision of the Attorney General.

One of the greatest problems in conducting a study of this

type is the location of pertinent documents and material which

bear on the issues.

We have located

copies of the documents

related primarily to the heart of this issue,

our basic authority

in the national security field - namely, the

presidential directives

and Executive orders which we have cited in addition to statutes

as being our sources of authority - but there may be other very

pertinent documents bearing on the Executive intent to have the

FBI conduct intelligence-type investigations.

A good example

is evidence used by the

Papich Committee, but not found during

this study, which shows that President Roosevelt called

White House conference on May 9, 1934, attended by the Attorney

General, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Labor, Director of

FBI, and

Chief of the U. S. Secret Service to deal with the problem

growth of fascist organizations in the United States. The

ference agreed that there should be an investigation of

groups and their activities

for intelligence purposes.

Since

the only Federal law believed applicable at the time was the

Immigration Law, the President decided that the Commissioner of

Imnigration and

Naturalization Service should confer with the

Chief of Secret

Service and the Director of FBI to work out

details of the investigation.

- 39-

HH 55024 DocId: 32989609 Page 174

---

## Page 175

Mr. Hoover immediately issued orders to FBI personnel to

conduct an intensive investigation of the Nazi movement.

This,

evidently, was the

first general intelligence investigation made

by the Government into fascist activities in this country. But

note that this general intelligence investigation was based in

law, namely the Immigration Law. We have here an example of

the exercise of inherent Executive power tempered by

the fact

that the Presidential desire for intelligence investigations would

be implemented because there was a statute covering the situation.

Basically, the same applies to the 1936 arrangement between the

President, the Director of the FBI and the Secretary of State.

The law permitting the Secretary of State to request the Attorney

General to investigate certain matters was the legal basis for

the subsequent FBI investigations.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary

and conclusion, it is believed that the facts

clearly show that while there is

labyrinth of conflicting infor-

mation and opinions concerning the FBI's authority to conduct

intelligence-type investigations in the national security

field,

there are a few basic points requiring

clarification.

is believed that we must first sweep

away the myth that the FBI

now has any investigative authority based on the Presidential

directives dating from 1939, and that any investigative

responsibility we derived from those directives is so outdated as

to be very questionable if not entirely void.

This is, of course,

taking into consideration the national situation at the time the

directives were individually

issued.

secondly, it 1s believed thai the fBl does have a valid

reason to conduct intelligence-type investigations based

the fact that there are laws prohibiting all the various

types of

subversion truly affecting the national security and that the

Government has the right to protect itself from destruction by

conducting whatever preventive or intelligence-type investigations

are necessary to see that individuals and organizations

do not do those things, in violation of the law, which could

threaten the national

security.

Preventive or intelligence-type

investigations would include the use of confidential informants

and sources of information, the calling on law enforcement officers

and patriotic citizens and

organizations to furnish all information

concerning subversion to the FBI, the collection of overt

intelligence data from publications and other public source

material, including congressional hearings, and the full scale

investigation of allegations received from all sources.

- 40 -

HH 55024 DocId: 32989609 Page 175

## Page 176

Our intelligence-type investigations, however, should

meticulously adhere to guidelines which would

clearly prohibit

any intrusion or abridgement of an individual's rights

guaranteed

under the Constitution, particularly the First, Fourth and Fifth

Amendments.

To assure

that the proper guidelines are drawn we

should request the Department of Justice to issue them and then

afford the closest possible supervision of investigation, both

in the field and at Headquarters to see

that our intelligence

investigations are kept within these guidelines.

The voicing

of this

need does not indict our

existing guidelines or careful

supervision, but merely recommends that our responsibilities be

described and, where necessary, circumscribed by the Attorney General

whose duty under the law is to

supervise our activity.

It appears that the most effective means of laying to

rest the persistent complaints of various

engages in political surveillance (investigations) in violation of

First and Fourth

Amendment rights is to have definitive legislative

enactment carefully state what the FBI must do to protect the

national security.

such could be resolution or statute, but should

cover in complete

detail what acts should be investigated by the

FBI, and, in particular, that the FBI must conduct preventive or

intelligence-type investigations to protect the national security.

Under the political climate existing in the country today,

however, the

passage of either a statute or a resolution of the

type needed is very remote.

Because of the misconceptions and

misapprehensions surrounding investigations relating to subversion,

atmosphere of suspicion in congressional

likely stifle any attempt to formulate any such legislation

at this time.

We should, however, recommend to the Department chat

consideration be

given immediately to sponsoring some comprehensive

legislative enactment along the lines needed.

In the meantime, for the benefit of the FBI, the

Department of Justice and the rest of the Executive Branch of

Government, including the

staff at the White House, it appears

that the next best thing is to have a comprehensive Executive

order issued, under the inherent Executive power, outlining

exactly what

responsibilities the FBI has in the protection

of the national security and in furnishing the President

the data he needs to fulfill his responsibilities under"the

Constitution.

To be effective such Executive order would have to

clearly define the FBI's intelligence collection responsibilities

and would necessarily have to contain language which

would

satisfy the courts

that First and Fourth Amendment rights are

- 41 -

7H 55024 DocId:32989609 Page 176

---

## Page 177

not being abrogated in any manner.

Langnage in such an order

would ideally follow the basic language and purposes of Executive

Ordex 11605, since this deals with virtually every type of

subversive activity confronting the country today.

It is finally concluded that this

study has shown that

the

• FBI has in the past conducied no intelligence-type investigations

which were not permissible under the law, particularly under the

concept that intelligence-type or preventive-type investigations

are lawful when the product and purpose of the investigation

is to prevent a violation of a statute.

believed, however,

that every area of our national security investigations

be reviewed for the purpose of determining what additional

constitutional safeguards should be considered. This is particularly

true in light of the fact that much of our investigative

activity

in the past was

geared to the Emergency Detention Act, which was

repealed

in October, 1971.

We should make absolutely certain,

for

example, that the procedures adopted in setting up our

Administrative Index, following repeal of the Emergency Detention

Act,

are

not being used to circumvent the

repeal of the

Emergency Detention Act.

In this regard, it is to be noted that

a detailed study of the Administrative Index has been underway

and is almost complete

as of this date.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1.

That upon completion of a final draft of the study

dealing with this

matter, a

letter to the Department be prepared

containing the essence of this study, pointing out our findings

and requesting

(a) The

Department's opinion concerning our findings,

particularly directives discussed herein; (b) The Department's

opinion

concerning

the legality of intelligence-type or preventive-

type investigations based on existing statutes; (c) Requesting the

Department to issue comprehensive investigative guidelines for

future investigations of the intelligence or preventive type;

(d). Requesting the Department to sponsor comprehensive legislation

spelling out the FBI's investigative authority in the collection of

intelligence information relating to the

national security; and

(e) Requesting the Department to seek a comprehensive Executive

order which

would cover

any possible gaps between statutory authority

and Executive necessity in protection of the national security.

2.

That a penetrative study be completed at the

earliest possible date concerning all

our current national

security investigative guidelines to insure that

every possible

safeguard is in effect to protect the individual's rights

This memorandum recommends that Bureau space be

provided Senate Select Cormittee (SSC) Staff for review of

Bureau material and interviews of Bureau employees.

V

SSC Staff is in a phase of its inquiry concerning

Bureau operations which includes (1) review of considerable

SAC memoranda, etc.

members by Bureau officials and supervisors.

For many very

sound reasons it would be to the Bureau's distinct advantage

to provide limited, but suitable space within the J. Edgar

Hoover Building to

the SSC Staff.

Because we have been able

to obtain the Staff's agreement to review much of our material

at FBIHQ, rather than its insistence on turning the material

over to the Staff, we are in a position of insuring the

security of our material by maintaining it in our space at all

times.

Also, by having the SSC Staff

conduct its review of

the material

in our space, we can have personnel readily

available to answer their

inquiries, thus precluding the

necessity for preparing otherwise needless correspondence

and

eliminating the necessity for having our personnel present

throughout their reviews if they took place elsewhere.

Further, from a psychological standpoint, it is to our

advantage that our employees be interviewed in our space rather

than in SSC offices.

Finally, space made available to SSC

Staff will also provide a desirable site for the various briefings

our people are giving to them.

It should be noted that the

providing of the space which this memorandum recommends is

similar to what we have already done for the General Accounting

Office in connection with its audit of our operataons ad

Space required should be sufficient to accommodate

three desks and three chairs plus two or three file cabinets;

and including the necessary desks, chairs and cabinets.

¡ Space should approximate that currently used to accommodate

Section Chief's offices

in the INID.

Because the SSC Staff has already commenced some of

its review of Bureau material and has already engaged in some

briefings, it is essential that urgent attention be given this

request.

INTD has already surveyed its space and would be

unable to accommodate the need involved.

Upon approval, Administrative Division will

immediately take necessary steps to provide for the necessary

space and equipment described above.

between Mr. John Elliff, Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff,

who is in charge of the

task force looking into the FBI, and

Messrs. Wannall, Leavitt, Branigan, and Cregar. Purpose of the (

meeting was to acquaint Elliff with the work of the Counterintelli-

gence Branch in the Intelligence Division.

House Select Committee (HSC)

LASSIFIED LIND

WECLASSIFY ON: 25X.

Elliff advised that the SSC is concerned with how the

HSC plans to conduct its probe of the intelligence community.

He anticipates HSC may hold hearings very shortly and possibly

prior to the time the SSC gets underway. At the present time,

Elliff knows of no agreement or plans to provide the HSC with

copies

of intelligence community documents the SSC has been furnished.

Department of Justice

• According to Elliff, Kevin I. Maroney, Deputy Assistant

Attorney General, Criminal Division, has agreed to allow Staff

Members of the SSC to review the Department's file on the

Intelligence Evaluation Committee (this was a Committee chaired

by the Department and evalved from one of the recommendations set

out-in the "Hpuston Plan." During its existence the Bureau had

several representatives assigned to the IEC).

Mr. Maroney has also advised the SSC Staff that in the

1966-67 period the Department of Justice did an extensive study

on the legal authority for the conductof electronic surveillances.

Elliff was quite pleased that the Justice Department planned to make

this study

available for review by Staff Members of the SSC in the

Department's Building and expressed the hope that the Bureau would

also see fit to allow Staff Members to review research and studies

the: Bureau might have conducted in the area of sensitive investi-

gative techniques.

RE: SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

Sensitive Investigative Techniques

Mr. Elliff felt that much could be accomplished in

responding to the SSC request of 5/14/75 if the Bureau could

pull together the basic FBI documents delineating our legal

authority to engage in the following investigative techniques.

(1) Electronic surveillances, including consensual

electronic surveillances; (2) all forms of mail surveillances

Including covers and openings; (3) physical surveillances

including Special Agent (SA) infiltration of target groups;

photography and remote viewing and sensing devices (laser

beams); (4) surreptitious entries; (5) incommunicado interroga-

tions; and (6) bank credit, and other personal information.

It was Elliff's opinion that if the Committee could

be allowed to review the legal authority for such surveillances

along with the documents showing how the decision-making process

worked in instituting, approving and discontinuing such operations,

much of the misunderstandings some members of the Committee have

would be clarified. Elliff also felt a detailed briefing of the

Committee with whatever limitations the Bureau desired to place

on the number and level of those to be briefed would be extremely

helpful in assisting the Committee in developing some authority

for the FBI to legally engage in such sensitive activities in

the future.

Three Top Priority Items of the SSC

Elliff advised that in his judgment the three top

priority items of the SSC regarding the FBI are as follows.

(1) Develop legislation to clearly delineate the Bureau's

jurisdictional authority in the security and counterintelligence

field. (2) Provide the Bureau with some authoritative basis,

either statutory or otherwise, to engage in certain counter-

intelligence activities, i.e, surreptitious entry, electronic

surveillances, incommunicado interviews, in national security

cases when the

need for such activity has'been clearly established.

(3) To improve the coordination between the FBI and the rest

of the intelligence community.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall SECRET

RE: SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

Elliff was questioned about the reason for the

hird priority. He responded by noting that one President

(Nixon) had stated that in 1970 there was a breakdown in the

relations between the FBI and the rest of the intelligence

community. Elliff was informed that this was not so, that the

discontinuance of a formal liaison relationship with

Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) and subsequently the rest of the

intelligence community in 1970 did not mean that there was a

breakdown in coordination. Elliff asked why the Bureau dis-

continued a formal liaison relationship with CIA in early 1970.

We briefly reviewed for Elliff the Thomas Riha case pointing

out that Mr. Kelley had personally caused a review of that

case in an effort to determine whether it, in fact, was the

reason for the discontinuance of our liaison relationship with

the CIA. Elliff was informed that this was the case.

addition, we discussed with Elliff the 1966 understanding

between CIA and the FBI and made it quite clear to him that

we felt the relationship with not only CIA but the entire

intelligence community was excellent.

Other Matters of Interest

During the course of the briefing, Elliff was shown

charts depicting the inordinate increase of Sino-Soviet bloc

official presence in the U. S. from 1959 through January, 1975,

the growth of the presence of foreign hostile intelligence

officials in the U. S. during this same period compared with

the static number of SAs we had working against this threat

during this same period. Elliff was concerned over the fact

¡that the presence of Sino-Soviet bloc officials as well as the

intelligence officers increased substantially while the number

of SAs dedicated to counterintelligence investigations remained

static. He wondered why this was so. Elliff was advised that

lit was a question of manpower and priorities. He was told that

during the 1959-1975 period there was a considerable demand for

the usecof SA personnel in the fields of organized crime, civil

Fights,&ghetto riots. In addition, during that period of time

additional investigative responsibilities were placed upon the

FBI by virtue of new legislation.

Elliff was also interested in knowing whether our

He was advised they were not.

Elliff also asked whether CIA

Reference is made to memorandum from

Office

of

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams, dated June 10, 1975, captioned

as above, (copy attached) wherein it was recommended and approved

that representatives of the Intelligence Division meet with.

Mr. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination, Office of

the Deputy Attorney General, for the

purpose of briefing him concerning the contents of a Bureau letter

to Mr. George P. Williams, Associate Counsel to the President at

the White House, dated July 23, 1974, captioned "Electronic

Coverage Placed

at the Request

of the White House."

By way of background, the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

has requested certain documents and information relating to the

so-called "Kissinger 17."

Some of this information has already

been prepared and

furnished to O'Connor with the caveats that the

Government has not publicly admitted to 15 of the coverages involved

and some material relating to the remaining two has been impounded

by court order due to pending civil suits.

The decision was left

to the Department as to whether or not material prepared in resporse

Ito SSC requests should be made available to that Committee.

Mr. O'Connor on June 9, 1975, requested of Assistant Director®

John Mintz a briefing as to the contents of the above July 43, 15x4,

letter which he believed summarized information available to the s

Bureau concerning the 17 wire taps. •

On June 17, 1975, Special Agents John W. Dalseg and

Thomas J. McNiff met

with Mr. William O'Connor and the latter's

assistant, Michael T.

Shaheen, in the office of Mr. O'Connor. Afte

ya briefing on the

contents of the July

concluded that information contained

enclosures is too sketchy to enable a knowledgeable determination

be made as to whether or not requested material should be released

"Kissinger 17" and he stated his office would, in the near future,

prepare a letter to the Director similarly requesting that

Mr. Shaheen or some other designated representative of his staff

be granted authority to review the Bureau file concerning the

matter in question.

OBSERVATIONS:

During the above conversation Mr. O'Connor appeared to

be primarily interested in the completeness of the Bureau file with

regard to matters relating to the "Kissinger 17" and to what degree

information in this file had been made public. It was explained to

Mr. O'Connor, who appeared knowledgeable concerning the history of

these documents, that this file contains all communications known

to be in existence concerning the "Kissinger 17," but no one can

state with certainty, due to the manner in which this material was

handled at the specific request of the White House, that the file

contains

all communications prepared in this matter.

With regard

to publicity afforded these documents, Mr. O'Connor

stated he is

familiar with the documents which had

been made available to the

Department for referral to various Committees and he is familiar

with excised versions of these documents which had been published

by these Committees. He indicated that the Department's present

problem is that no

record has been located in the Department to

date as to just which material or in what form such material

furnished by the Bureau to the Department was subsequently turned

lover to the Committees by the Department. O'Connor stated it

could be embarrassing

at this time to make available to the SSC

material which had

not previously been made available to the

Congressional Committees and equally embarrassing to withhold

from the SSC material which was previously furnished Congressional

Committees.

ACTION:

None. Above submitted for information.

In anticipation of Department's request cited in

"Kissinger 17' Special Agent (SA) Robert F. Peterson, Office of

hoistent is handie the tries suite a

the Halperin Civil Suit, to

determine if the United States District Court's (USDC) impoundment

would prevent this Bureau making available this file to

representatives of the Department. Christenbury, late 6/18/75,

advised SA Peterson that he, Christenbury, had contacted plaintiff's

(Halperin) attorney, who advised he had no objection to this

file being made available to a Department representative for

review.

Christenbury then attempted to contact USDC Judge

John Lewis Smith, who issued the impoundment order in this matter.

Christenbury spoke to Judge Smith's law clerk, who advised that

in view of the position taken by plaintiff's attorney, he did .

not believe that Judge Smith would interpose any objection to

the Department's anticipated request. The law clerk stated,

however, that he would contact Judge Smith at the earliest

opportunity to obtain a ruling and would advise Christenbury of

the results.

You will be advised of the results when received.

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

On 6/9/75, Mr. K. William O'Connor telephonically

advised me that the Committee is interested in information concerning

certain electronic surveillance coverage instituted at the request of the

White House concerning seventeen individuals. Mr. O'Connor said that

he understands that a letter was addressed to the White House by the

Bureau furnishing copies of documents that summarized the information

available to the Bureau concerning the alleged seventeen wiretaps.

„Mr. O'Connor requested that he be briefed concerning this matter

in order for him to discuss the Committee's requests.

It appears that Mr. O'Connor may be referring to a ietter

dated July 23, 1974, that was addressed to Mr. George P. Williams:

Associate Counsel to the President, at the White House.

A memorandum

was addressed to the Attorney General also dated July 23, 1974, captioned

"Electronic Coverage Placed At The Request of the White House, " which

advised the Department that pursuant to the authorization of the Deputy

Attorney General certain documents had been furnished to Mr. Williams

at the White House.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division identify the materials involved

in Mr. O'Connor's request and provide him with an appropriate briefing.

By memo dated 6-10-75, you were advised that

K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination in the Department, requested he be allowed to

review

a summary prepared concerning the so called "Kissinger

17" wiretaps since the Senate Select Committe had included a

request for information concerning them in their letter of

May 14, 1975. Mr. O'Connor and his Deputy, Michael Shaheen,

reviewed the

summaries.

At Mr. O'Connor's request, a conference was held

with Messrs O'Connor and Shaheen and SA Robert Peterson,

SA Paul V. Daly, Inspector John B. Hotis, and Assistant

Director John A. Mintz, present to discuss the SSC request for

documents concerning the "Kissinger 17" wiretaps and his concern

that the furnishing of such documents might adversely impact

on existing litigation involving the Bureau, and may subject the

Bureau to additional lawsuits.

Most of the documents in question

are also under a protective order of the Court in the Halperin

Case and therefore, a release must be orchestrated with the

Court.

Mr. O'Connor suggested that a summary of existing

summaries of these wiretaps be prepared by the Department and

with the acquiescence of the Court which issued the protective

order be made available for review by the committee in the

Re:

Department of Justice. Mr. O'Connor also mentioned that the

summary would, of course, have to set forth the sufficient

information to allow the Committee to make a determination that the

information derived from these wiretaps was not used for political

purposes.

Mr. Mintz expressed concern that the publication

or leaking of information from summaries could expand the number

and nature of suits facing the Bureau and suggested the Department

should, in obtaining the Court approval for making the summaries

available, request the Court to issue appropriate safeguards

against publication of such information. Mr. O'Connor stated

that such a recommendation to the Court would be proper and that

this would be done.

Mr. Mintz told Mr. O'Connor that the Bureau at this

time cannot make a commitment to the making available of the

summaries to the Committee without further study and approval,

and an approval would be sought expeditiously.

Additionally,

Mr. Mintz requested that the Bureau be given the opportunity to

review the summaries prepared by the Department to insure the

Bureau's interests are protected.

RECOMMENDATION:

That we notify the Department that we are in agreement

concerning the preparation of summaries based on existing

summaries of "Kissinger 17" wiretaps with the provision that

we be given the opportunity to review these summaries prior

to the Department seeking Court approval for making them

available.

Mark Gitenstein, staff member of captioned Committee

who has been doing an extensive inquiry into the "official and confidential"

files reportedly maintained in former Director Hoover's office,

telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly 6-5-75 and requested the

identities of the employees who had brought the material from the

Director's office during May, 1972, to Mr. Hoover's residence and

to Mr. Felt's office.

By way of background, Mr. Gitenstein has obtained through

interview of Mr. Felt, former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr,

and other Bureau personnel familiar with the operations of the Director's

office, considerable knowledge concerning the official and confidential

files.

There is also an extensive request contained in captioned Committee's

letter of 5-4-75 pertaining to information surrounding these files.

Additionally, we responded to a request of the Committee contained in their

letter of 4-28-75 pertaining to the allegation of removal of certain material

from Mr. Hoover's residence after the death of former Associate Director

Clyde Tolson. We have not, at this point, determined that Bureau documents

have been removed from Bureau space to Mr. Hoover's residence or any

other place outside the Bureau. However, it is apparent that Mr. Gitenstein

has information, or believes he has information, relating to the removal

of Bureau documents.

Mr. Citenstein starod no ma rotoriod 3. 13 269X1

to the Director John P. Mohr on 6-5-75 and Mr. Mohr, in response to

Mr. Gitenstein's question, stated that the identities of employees who may

and to Mr. Felt's office subsequent to Mr. Hoover's death could be learned

through an inquiry in the Mechanical Section supply room.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams

RE: SENSTUDY 75

In light of this response, Mr. Gitenstein requested that

the Bureau identify the personnel involved and it is his obvious intention

that the personnel will be interviewed.

Inasmuch as the Inspection Division is conducting inquiry

into this matter, it would appear proper for that Division to determine

the identities of such personnel and,

if deemed necessary, interview in

connection with the current inquiry.

It is also believed that while this

request is oral in nature from the Committee, we should consider

furnishing the information as to the identities of employees to the

Committee inasmuch as if we do not respond to the oral request •

Mr. Gitenstein indicated, because of the Committee's interest in this

matter, there would be no problem in his obtaining authority to turnish the

request in writing. It is apparent at this point that we would not be able

to keep such information from the Committee if such a written request were

to be received. Additionally, by responding to the oral request it will

encourage the Committee, in the areas they described as "abuse-type,"

to give us an advance indication as to their inquiries.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Inspection Division make the necessary inquiry

concerning the identities of the employees and, if deemed advisable,

make available to the Legal Analysis Office that information which will

be furnished to the Committee.

The interview, which was not conducted under oath,

With regard to the organizational structure, they

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF SA CHARLES D. BRENNAN BY SSC

With regard to Martin luther King, Jr., Brennan advised

that he got the impression from the Staff Members they felt

the Bureau hau an "Illegitimate" interest in King. Brennan

countered by saying the basis for the FBI interest in King

was predicated on the communist influence surrounding King.

He was asked if the Bureau employed many viretaps against King

to which he answered that most of the information obtained was

derived from live informants.

Relative to the COINTELPRO, Brennan advised the

Staff Members he couldn't be very specific regarding COINTELPRO

Inasmuch as he did not pay too much attention to it. They

questioned him about this statement and Brennan stated that

Brennan was asked why he didn't recommend COINIELPRO be dis-

continued to which he replied "If City Hall wants it, you give

them what they want."

This memorandum reports the results of a tele-

Telephone Rm te

Directorse

phonic conversation with former Special Agent (SA) Charles D.

Brennan and recommends that the attached letter to the Attorney

General with enclosures be sent.

On the morning of 5/23/75 the Department of Justice

advised Assistant Director Mintz that former SA Brennan has or was

to be interviewed by Staft Members of the Senate Select Committee

• A

(SSC). On that same date I telephonically contacted Mr. Brennan

to advise him that the Bureau had been alerted to the fact he was

going to be interviewed by the SSC Staff and should he desire, a

representative of the Bureau could be available during the interview

for consultation. It was made clear to Brennan that the röle of the

Bureau representative would be to insure that he could consult i

the representative at any. time during the interview should the

of inquiry reveal? the identity of sensitive FBI sources, methode

or sensitive investigative techniques; information derived from

third agencies or friendly foreign intelligence services; or any

100

information which Brennan felt could adversely affect sensitive

ongoing FBI investigations.

Breman then change the conversation to personal ehite

chat. At what appeared to be the conclusion of the conversation

Cregar asked Brennan if he had been contacted by the SSC Staff. S

Brennan advised that he had received a telephone call earlier in the

week inviting him to an interview in Washington, D. C., and in fact

was interviewed on 5/22 by SSC Staff Members Mark Gitenstein and

two others whose names

Brennan did not get.

Brennan showed some concern over the fact that the Staff

had invited him to be interviewed earlier in the week but only

notified the Department subsequent to his interview. (At the

outset of the conversation with Brennan, I had advised him that

the SSC had inforned the DepartmeREd. 102

Bureau that he was to be interviewed). Brennan stated he was

not furnished a copy of the Senate Resolution or its Rüles of

Procedures and was not advised of his rights or the fact that

he could be represented by counsel. He was not put under oath,

and was not given any indication as to the scope of the inter-

view prior to his appearance in Washington. In response to a

question by Cregar as to what areas the interview covered,

Brennan stated the interview covered three specific topics.

(1) The organizational structure of the Bureau; (2) Martin Luther

King, JI.; (3) the COINTELPRO.

With regard to the organizational structure Brennan

advised that the Staff Members appear to have little understanding

as to the way the Bureau was structured. He stated they had no

appreciation of what a unit, section, or division was comprised

of.

They showed him several copies of memoranda from 'Brennan to

Sullivan;

and proceeded to ask him about the contents of these

memoranda. When Brennan was unable to describe the background

or details surrounding a specific memorandum, they voiced

wonderment as to why he had such little recollection about a

memorandum he apparently wrote. Brennan advised the Staff

Members that just because the memorandum was written from him

to Sullivan did not mean that he necessarily wrote the memorandum

or even saw it.

In respectito Martin Luther King, JI., Brennan got

the impression that the Staff Members believed the Bureau was

"illegitimately" interested in King. Brennan advised that he

hit back hard on this stating thai the Bureau's interest 1n

King was predicated on the communist influence surrounding

King. They asked if the Bureau had employed many wiretaps

against King. Brennan advised that most of the information

obtained on King derived from live informants.

Brennan voiced

the opinion that the Staff Members were rather disappointed with

Brennan's defense of the Bureau in the King investigation.

Staff Members showed some disappointment in Brennan's

inability to remember circumstances surrounding COINTELPRO.

Brennan responded by saying that he never paid much attention

to COINTELPRO and when compared to such activity as to the

Bay of Pigs and the Glomar Explorer, the COINTELPRO was

"peanuts."

At' the conclusion of the conversation, Brennan advised

that SSC Staff Members indicated they would want him to return

for additional interviews. I advised Brennan that should he

receive a subpoena to return or should he be invited to return

to Washington, D. C., to be interviewed under oath, it would be

wiseffor him to contact the FBI's Legal Counsel Division for

advice to insure that he was in compliance with the Attorney

General's order relative to the release of information obtained

while an employee of the FBI. Brennan indicated he would contact

the Legal Counsel Division should he be contacted by the SSC and

would probably ask that a Bureau representative be available for

consultation during a subsequent interview or testimony.

ACTION: If approved, the attached letter to the Attorney General

and its enclosures reflecting the results of the debriefing of

Brennan, be sent.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.

possible cooperation to congressional committees requesting information from

departmental files, interviews with department employees, testimony of depart-

ment personnel, or testimony of Federal prisoners. The following procedures

are prescribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will be

mutually satisfactory to the congressional committees and to the Department.

•(Inis order supersedes the Deputy Attorney General's Memorandum No. 5, dated

March 23, 1953; and his Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954.

It formal-

Izes the Attorney General's press release of November 5, 1953, establishing

procedures to permit cormittees of the Congress and their authorized repre-

sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

No. 3464, Supplement No. 4 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953 (with Memorandum

of "Authorization Under Order No. 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated

January 13, 1953), Insofar as said orders have reference to procedures to be

followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In

representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI

as well as investigative reports from any other agency,

from the FBI reports and memoranda be made available,

he will be advised that the request will be considered

by the Department. Thereafter a summary of the contents

of the FBI reports and memoranda involved vill be

prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-

niques, the identity of confidential informants, or

other matters which might jeopardize the investigative

operations of the FBI. This summary will be forwarded

by the division to the FBI with a request for advice as

to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of

such summary by the committee representative. The file

will not be physically relinquished from the custody of

the Department. If the committee representative desires

to examine investigative reports from other government

agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he

will be advised to direct his request to the agency whose

reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, 1. e., one which liti-

gation or administrutive action is pending or contemplated, the file may

not be made available for examination by the committee's representative.

D. REQUESTS OF CONCRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

their public testimony may affect the discipline and well-being of the institu-

tion, it is the policy of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out -

side the penal institution in which they are incarcerated for the purpose of

being Interviewed or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,

BELA

adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise

adversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath

E. OBSERVERS IN ATTENDANCE AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS

matters within its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney

General may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with Congress and

its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a

congrssional hearing, will have the observer prepare a written summary of

the proceeding which should be sent to the division head and a copy routed
