to the post of First District Commander. REYNOLDS was desirous

of knowing whether MARCI wished to have him have RIORDAN

present at this luncheon but was told by MARCI that he

wished to discuss the situation with REYNOLDS before talking

to RIORDAN. It appeared to the source that REYNOLDS has

already, or will by the time of the luncheon, have talked with

RIORDAN

and determined what his orders are in regard to the

strip joints in the Loop. From the information he furnishes

MARCI, MARCI will then determine what tack to take with

RIORDAN at such time as they meet.

Later in the day MARCI was joined by one SAM (LNU),

a Democratic Precinct Captain within the 28th Ward, who met

with MARCI to discuss the possibility of his being nominated

as the potential Alderman for this Ward. It is pointed out

that the former Alderman of this Ward was one ANTHONY GIROLAMI,

presently the Clerk of the Probate Court who is identical

with CG 6498-PC. Their conversation was as follows:

MARCI:

I know there's a lot of guys shootin' for it.

I haven't heard anything about it. If I tell you

not to go for it, I might be hurting your

chances. There's a possibility.

SAM:

Who can I talk to? I can talk to you, I can

talk to JOHN, but there's nobody else.

MARCI:

I don't know if they've got anybody in mind or

It wasn't discussed yet.

Maybe they were

waiting to see if TONY (GIROLAMI) was elected.

Now they'll get busy. I don't know if they'll

take a guy that belongs to the organization or

one that doesn't belong to the organization.

As soon as I know that they are considering

guys I'll let you know about it.

Unless you go

to TONY and tell him that you'd like to be

considered. I think you should.

SAM:

I'd be very happy to do that.

MARCI:

That's where I'd start. Then if he gets to say

who it is you got a chance. If he told who

it will be that's something else. But up

• to

my knowledge I know it isn't gone yet.

don't even know

who's

in front. There's so

many guys going I don't know who the front

runners are.

CG :92-350

In reference to the above it is noted that CG 6498-PC

has advised concerning several contacts which have been made

with him during the past year or so by Chicago top hoodlums,

SAM GIANCANA and MURRAY HUMPHREYS. This PCI, who is the

leading political power in his Ward, advised SA WILLIAM F.

ROEMER last week that considerable pressure has been put on

him to lend his influence, which is tantamount to the Democratic

nomination and therefore to election, to certain individuals

in their campaign to become Aldermen of the 28th Ward, a

Ward located on the west side of Chicago in a predominantly

Italian section. The PCI has advised that GIANCANA IS

interested in the nomination of BOBBY PETRONE, mentioned

above by MARCI.

The PCI also advised that several lesser

hoodlums, probably including JOE GAGLIANO, have approached

him concerning the candidacy of JOE GARAMBRONE, mentioned

above by MARCI. It is noted that GARAMBRONE is presently the

PCI's secretary in his Ward organization and is also the

brother of MOUSEY GARAMBRONE, who is a chief lieutenant of the

GUS ALEX - LOUIE BRIATTA gambling organization in the First

Ward of Chicago. However, last week the PCI advised that

he has not yet announced it and is keeping it quiet but bas

decided to lend his support to AL TOMASO.

TOMASO was formerly

the head of the Chicago Office of the Illinois Secretary of

State, is a former school teacher in Chicago, is a graduate

of DePaul Law School, is a former student for the priesthood

who now has a son studying for the priesthood, and to the

knowledge of the PCI has never been tainted by association

with hoodlums or by an arrest.

PCI stated that he is very

sincerely trying to find the best man in his Ward organization

contrary to the desires of the hoodlum and gambling interests

there.
