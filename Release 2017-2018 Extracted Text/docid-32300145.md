A confidential source abroad advised on August 12,

1963, as follows:

The records of the Mexican Immigration Service

reflect that shortly after the incorporation of the Cia.

Azteca de Administracion, S. A., on April 20, 1960, a

series of letters was directed to the Mexican Immigration

Service by this company in an effort to obtain authorization

fOr STEWART B. HOPPS to assume charge of the company.

After

several refusals, said authorization was finally granted

on June 13, 1961, but apparently HOPPS did not enter Mexico

as the Mexican Government files fail to reflect any further

action in this connection.

These same Mexican Government files reflect that

JOHN M. KEARNEY (CLEARY) was born March 20, 1895, at La

Plata, Maryland, and entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo on

October 20, 1920, and was engaged for many years at Veracruz

and vicinity as an employee of oil companies (not specified).

He is married to MARIA TERESA NOLAN and he became a Mexican

citizen on April 20, 1945.

The records of the Visa Section of the American

Embassy reflect that JOHN KEARNEY (CLEARY), Mexican citizen,

born March 20, 1895, at La Plata, Maryland, with residence

at Rio Tamesis #3, Mexico City,

was issued

visas on

January 3, 1961,

and December 26, 1962.

He has an unlimited

visa to travel to the United States until December 26, 1963.

Efforts were made to locate KEARNEY at the above address;

however, at this address there is now located a singing

school.

the past, advised on August 28, 1963, as follows:
