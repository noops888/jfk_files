STOKES was observed making at least four telephone calls from

approximately 4:52 pm until 5:15 pm.

He then went to a Texaco

Service Station located at the same

address operated by a C. L.

CAUSEY.

STOKES was observed making several calls from the

station's telephone and it also appeared that he was well

acquainted with the employees at the

station.

He then left

and went directly to his residence.

On 10/9/62, PCI

(DL 137-1241),

advised he had received a

telephone call from his brother,

@subject EBERHARDT.

EBERHARDT told him on 10/8/62 that STOKES

Thad lost $1100 the previous weekend booking football bets through

the use of parlay cards,

EBERHARDY stated that several employees

in the General Motors plant,

Arlington, Texas, had "hit" STOKES

quite hard.

EBERHARDT commented that STOKES distributed a large

number of the parlay cards at this plant as well as Ling Tenco

Vought.

Later on 10/9/62, STOKES contacted the PCI on 10/8/62

and stated he wanted 1,000 cards delivered as per usual on

/ 10/9/62. STOKES commented that he had lost $1100 the past

weekend, saying some "fellows" at General Motors, Arlington,

had all picked the same four teams, not further identified,

and

had won on this parlay.

PCI delivered 1,000 cards, numbered 1

through 1,000, to STOKES' truck at Ling Temeo Yought on 10/9/62,

however, no money had been left for him. PCI later on 10/9/62

advised

STOKES had called PCI about 2 PM and apologized for not

leaving the money in the truck.

STOKES said he would send the

money by registered mail. STOKES also commented that the "woman"

who had been backing him had "pulled out" because of the heavy

losses.

STOKES stated, however, that a welder in the Ling Tenco

Vought Corp. who is of

Jewish extraction has agreed to back

STOKES and

STOKES claimed this welder gave him $5,000 on 10/9/62

to back the bookmaking operation.

STOKES told PCI that this is

the same man who gets the line for STOKES.

Because of the new

backing, STOKES told PCI he would need more cards for the week

beginning 10/15/62.

Above information was furnished to Lt. JACK REVILL,

Intelligence Section, Dallas PD, and Deputy BOB MORGAN, Dallas

SO, on 10/9/62.

An artiele appearing in a Dallas newspaper on 10/9/62

stated that CHERRY and WAAGE had been arrested and charged with

the possession of money orders stolen in the burglary of a Dallas

postal sub station 7/20/62.

It should be noted that the infor

nation which led to the identification of CHERRY as being in

possession of the stolen money orders and of WAAGE as being an

associate, as well as information concerning the travels of

CHERRY subsequent to the burglary, had been obtained by Dallas

from DL 95C, and furnished to the Postal authorities, Dallas.

Based on this information, Postal authorities were subsequently

able to obtain evidence with which to charge WAAGE and CHARRY

with the violation.

On 10/12/62, HOWARD GRUBBS, Executive Secretary,

Southwest Athletic Conference, Dallas, furnished information

he had just received from the coach of the Texas A&M football

team, HANK FULBERG, concerning the possible obtaining of infor

mation to be used in gambling activities by & SAM WINER of Miami.

Details obtained from GRUBBS were furnished to the Bureau, Miami,

and Houston Offices by Dallas airtel 10/12/62.

On 10/12/62, PCI

(DL 137-1216) advised

that it would possibly be worthwhile to

ascertain if football

official JAMES FORD (See Dallas airtel 10/8/62) officiated the

Hardin Simmons - North Texas State football game of 10/6/62.

stated there was something wrong as there was no "line for

this

game" throughout the week and bookmakers are becoming

suspicious of any game in which FORD is involved. -
