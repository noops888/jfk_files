Ro speech by OREN FENTO POTITO, St. Petersburg, Florida:

January 16, 1964.

On the evening of January 16, 1964 a dinner sponsored by

OREN FENTON POTITO was held at Donat's Restaurant, 6001 Haines Road,

North St. Petersburg, Florida. The dinner meeting was informal pub-

Iic in nature and approximately 41 persons were in attendance.

The source has identified POlITO as a member_of the _Natiotal

States_Rights-Party, (NSRP) in the Spring of 1963 at which

resigned while holding the office of National Organizer..

Since that

time POTITO has held meetings of a public nature under various titles

all of which are non-existent organizations. He is not known to have

any national affiliation at the present time although he is in con-

tact with various leaders of right wing groups in the United States.

In the course of his speech of some 3 hours following the

dinner POTITO touched on 'the association between LEE HARVEY OSWALD

and RUBY.

POTITO identified RUBY, reäl name RUBENSTEIN, as a Commun-

ist Party Member since 1929 and through this connection linked him

to OSWALD. He identified OSWALD as a Communist through his association

with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC).

According to POTITO only two organizations knew the route

vice and the Dallas Police Department.

RUBY had insinuated himself

into the Police Department circle, obtained the route and arranged

with OSWALD to take the job at

the state school building along the

route to carry out the assasination.

POTITO said the "Surgeon General's report" on the assassi-

nation stated the first bullei entereu the President's throat below

the adams apple clearly showing that two persons were involved with

the first shot being fired from the bridge across the park way in

front of the car.

To further substantiate this, POTITO said there

was a bullet hole in the

wind shield of the President's car.
