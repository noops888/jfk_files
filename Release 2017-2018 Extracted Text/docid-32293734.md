small scale.

He stated they are handling this business strictly "hand to hand"

meaning they are meeting their customers at various downtown ballas

restaurants and clubs where they

furnish the customer the line

they have by noon each day, and then innediately take the custo

mer's bet.

Informant stated they are not using any telephones

In their business at the present time.

The

above information was furnished to EDD HASKINS,

Dallas PD, Intelligenes Section, on 7/27/63.

On 7/27/63, DL 185-C-TE advised that MATTHEWS was

presently in possession of $30, 000 which he had obtained for

"planting somebody", meaning murder for money.

further details concerning this, but stated he would attempt to

RE: JAMES WALTER CHERRY, aka.

ITSP; ITSMY

(DI 87-11447)

(00 - KANSAS CITY)

On 7/26/63, It was ascertained at the Dallas County SO

that a $2, 000 bond had been set on

the local charges of narcotics

possession pending against CHERRY.

It had been set in Justice of

Peace CHARLIE DAVIS

court.

It was further determined that the

detainer for the

USM concerning.

ITSP, charge outstanding at Baton

Rouge,

Louisiana, was still in effect, and CHERRY had been unable

to make either the $2,000 local bond or the $10, 000 recommended

bond on

the Federal charge.

It. FRANK CORNWALL, Dallas PD, was advised of above on

7/26/63 and he

became quite irritated, noting that CHerrY is a

three-time ex-convict, is charged with a matter which can result

in a 30 to 40 year sentence and the small snount of bond would

enable CHIllY to gain his freedom and immediately begin burglarizing

again.
