Bureau of Intelligence and Rescarch

Washington, D. C. 20520

Dear Mr. Hitchcock:

SECREL

This is to confirm the rcquest I inade to you on the

phone this afternoon.

I mentioned on thic phonc, it would

be greatly appreciated if you could supply an, information

that may be in State Department filos concuring the travel

of DI. Sidney Gottlieb to the Congo (now Zaire) in 1960.

Dr. Gottlicb was, at that time, an ennloyce of the

CIA.

the CiA keview stait has inforned le that Di. Gottlieb

often travelled under State Depaitwent cover! As 1 indicateu

today, the Coinittee has received document: from the CIA

which

raise the possibility that Di. Gottlich travelled to

the Congo from Washington, D. C., arriving approximately on

September 27, 1960.

lic probably travelled

to brazzaville and

inmediately made his way

" to Lcopoldville. It also appears

that the person in quesiion -- probably Dr. Gottlieb

departed from Leopoldville for the United States on October 5,

1960.

The Committee would be interested in my record of

such a trip that might be derived from a revien of passports

issued to Dr. Cottlich (cither in his true name or under alias)

or from any more detailed travel rccords that might be on

file, such as personnel orders, travel docuinents, and any

pertinent cables.

phone. I look forward to hearing from you.

Fredrick is.
