The San Juan main file on ANTONIO VECIANA (Also known

as ANTONIO CARLOS VECIANA BLANCH), D&POB 10/18/28, CUBA. is 105-

10960, one volume, (1969-1975) .

SJ file 105-6133 is the file of

the "Alpha 66" organization. The general indices search located

several references to VECIANA. A cursory review of the 8-volume

file indicated that ANTONIO VECIANA is mentioned in additional

serials which were not indexed to him. San Juan is, therfore,

forwarding the 8 volumes so the JFK Task Force can conduct a hand

search on VECIANA.

150, 625, 630, 539, and 579 (1962-1965).

02F 1Q-1029205-3414

2-63-417 and 2-63-718 were also

indexed to VECIANA.
