The PPS has been publicly identified

oy its secretary General, VICENTE LOMBARDO

JOLEDANO, as a Margift PartyU,

UGOCM was under the domination and control of

the PPS.

(It is noted that SALVADOR NAVAR ALARCON, PPS

and UGOCM leader in Juarez with whom the informant is

maintaining contact, was in Mexico City for most of the

month of March, 1967, making it impossible for the infor-

mant to be in contact with him during that period of time.

On March 28, 1967, SALVADOR NAVAR ALARCON advised

the informant that he had encountered difficulties at the

office of the Departamento Agrario in Mexico City and that

JACINTO LOPEZ, leader of the UGOCM in Mexico, accompanied

him

to this office, in regard to land problems in the colonies

of Juarez.

и)

NAVAR also told the informant about his other

activities in Mexico City, including his visit to the office

of the Secretaria del Patrimonio Nacional regarding land

problems, his conversation with PRI leaders.CoU

NAVAR indicated that he had visited the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico City and had been in contact with VICENTE

LOMBARDO TOLEDANO, the Secretary General of the PPS in Mexico.

NAVAR accused President LYNDON B. JOHNSON of being.

responsible for the death of Former President JOHN F. KENNEDY.

NAVAR said that the Yankees were not able to do

anything about the fact that FIDEL CASTRO gives support to

guerrilla forces in the countries of Latin America because

of the fact that the Yankees know that Cuba has Atomic Bombs

and would send these bombs to the principal cities of the

United States.

NAVAR also pointed out that FIDEL CASTRO has

Fussian and Chinese technical personnel to assist him regarding

these matters.
