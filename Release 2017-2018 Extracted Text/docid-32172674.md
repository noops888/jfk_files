The Bureau's attention is called to the fact that by

Bureau letter dated September 10, 1964, only three photographic

coples of Exhibit D-251 were forwarded to Dallas, with instructions

to be handled as exhibits had been handled previously. In view

of the fact that only three copies were furnished Dallas rather

than the usual four, Dallas is retaining one copy in its files

and the two enclosed herewith are being considered as copies for

the President's Commission of Its designated representative.

The Bureau may desire to remove the enclosure page of

this report tifi. 1t dis dissentrated te agencies other than the

President's Commission or its designated representative.

All leads in this case have been set forth by teletype or
