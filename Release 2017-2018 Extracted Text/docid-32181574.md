ADMINISTRATIVE DATA

The pretext used by SA DAVID J. REID in contacting

families by the name of PERRY listed in the El Paso Telephone

Directory was as follows: SA REID, without identifying himself,

asked to speak to EARL PERRY, it being determined in each case,

that no EARL PERRY resided at the address in question and that

no one by the name of EARL PERRY was known to the person

answering the telephone.

No leads are being set out in this report in view

of the

fact

that all leads have been previously set out by teletype.

set out in the body of this report, did not appear to warrant

Information furnished by Mrs. W. P. SCHUMACHER
