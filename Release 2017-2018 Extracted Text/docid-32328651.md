MASFERRER feels that the August 8 to 14, 1959 aborted

uprising in Cuba, although a failure, enhanced his

reputation and prestige because he opposed any invasion

from the Dominican Republic.

MASFERRER, through regular liaison and courier

system, is in contact with leaders in the Dominican

Republic and Miami. He was offered a base to operate

from in Guatemala and arms from Panama.

JAFFE will leave

in the near future for Guatemala concerning setting up

a base for MASFERRER in that country.

MASFERRER is considered important to General

PEDRAZA and other leaders because he reportedly has between

two to three thousand men in Oriente Province of Cuba

and two or three hundred in Havana Province.

These persons

reportedly will respond to MASFERRER and will revolt against

the CASTRO government whenever MASFERRER so orders it.

General BENITEZ advised that on August 8, 1959,

a meeting was held at MASFERRER's residence where

about

300 anti-CASTRO Cuban Nationals attended. Between 30 to

40 were former Cuban Army officers. All were alerted for a

possible expedition to leave the United States for eventual

armed invasion of Cuba.

When it was ascertained that the August 8, 1959

uprising in Cuba was unsuccessful, a shadow of gloom was

cast on the movement in Miami; however, the movement soon

recovered and claimed that the unsuccessful uprising did

e movemene in it the

not change any plans, but only postponed them.

(JAFFE, an American, is a close associate of

MASFERRER.)

"donated" $27,000 to ROLANDO MASFERER. This was done

out of fear that if he did not, MASFERRER would retaliate

against him at some later date.
