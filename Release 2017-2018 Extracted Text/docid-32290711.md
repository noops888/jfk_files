Army.

Private Alvarez identified hinself

as the son of Doctor

Santiago Juan Antonio Alvarez Rodriguez,

owner of the yacht

"Alisan," which reportedly was used in the raid against a

Sov" ship off Cuba on the night of March 26, 1963. He said

his Ixther had telephonically contacted him from Miami, Florida,

on ilach ?aia Jas, to acivise that he was back home sale and

successful. He quoted his father as stating

the remainder of the raiding group had returned to a base,

which was not identified.

On March 29, 1963, Santiago Juan Antonio Alvarez

Rodriguez advised our Miani Office as follows: (4)

He was formerly & Senator in Cuba and a doctor in

Mexico.

He resides in Miani and is unemployed at the present

time but owns and operates the "Alisan," which has two diesel

12D

The "Alisan" left Miami on March 17, 1963, and went

between Cat Cay and Orange Key.

The 23-foot boat was

taken into tow with the intention that arms hidden in three

seputie locations in the Bahamas would be picked up. Bad

weather forced a deiay, but on March 24 and 25, 1963, some

arms were collected.

The 23-foot boat was used to make the

attack and seven men participated. M/u)

After the attack,

the 23-foot boat was then used to

time the balance was $250, Three individuals identified with

Im66 in Puerto Rico advised on March 28, 1963, that they had

no previous knowledge. concerning the date the L-66 raid would

take place and that representatives of the group in fuerto Rico

had furnished nothing but money for this raid. It was stated

the group's funds in Puerto Rico have been exhausted and that

what little money had been available was sent to Pedro Muina

in Miami, Florida.

Concerning the March 18, 1963, raid on Cuba conducted

by members of Alpha 66.and the Second National Front of Escambray

(SNFE), our Miami Office on March 29, 1963, interviewed

Armando Fleites, a leader, of the SNFE, who

has previously been

identified

as having participated in this raid.

Fleites

claimed that all boats and weapons which figured in this raid,

as well as all participating personnel, are still located in

area of the Caribbean which he declined to identify.

However,

he insisted that no part of the action or preparation therefor

occurred in United States territory, including Puerto Rico or

the Nirgin Islands.

He declined to

be more specific or to

this raid, but claimed that n

With regard to the use of British territory in connection

with these raids, it is noted that the British territory in

closest proximity

to Cuba is the Cay Sal Bank, located 40 miles

from the northern coast of Cuba. This Bank includes many

uninhabited islands and stretches over hundreds.of miles of

water. A representative of British Intelligence who is located

Bahama Islands, advised our Miami Office on March 19,

1963,

that the British Government in the Bahamas has very few

patrol boats and that the Cay Sal is difficult to patrol because

of its great distance from Nassau. He acknowledged that the

majority of recent anti-Castro raids have reportedly been

conducted from islands located in the Cay Sal Bank. (C)
