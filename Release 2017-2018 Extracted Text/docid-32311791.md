These organizations

are comprised of elderly Jewish people whose relative

Importance is diminishing as members die and

are not replaced

by new recruits. In view of the liberal Jewish tradition

represented by an organization,

such as the YMHA, it is

questionable whether a counterintelligence offensive

directed at YMHA officials for the purpose of having

contracts for meeting rooms cancelled out would warrant

the time and effort involved.

As the Bureau is aware, Boslover Hall has been

the site utilized by the Philadelphia Social Science Forum

Committee (PSSFC) for meetings during the 1963-1964 Series.

In addition, a bazaar sponsored by

"The Advocates" (District

Press Committee, CPEPD) was held at Boslover Hall on 12/14,15/63.

3/18/64, providing additional registrations are obtained.

PH 398-S on 3/5/64 advised SA JEREMIAH W. DOYLI

that on the evening of 3/4/64 he went to Boslover Hall t

attend the Political Economy class; however, the maintenance

man there said that the management

at Boslover Hall had

received a call that afternoon notifying them that the

in obtaining Boslover Hall for the 1963-1964 PSSFC Series,

he stated that perhaps this would end

the harassment

of the PSSFC as

they had been refused meeting places in

hotels and other halls located in a more accessible

of Philadelphia.

(PH 55-S, 9/63)

A review of the file concerning the PSSFC reflects

that this organization, which since its inception in 1958

has utilized CP leaders and prominent left orientated

speakers, has utilized the following meeting halls:

Adelphia Hotel

13ch and Chestnut Streets

1958 through 10/12/62

Benjamin Franklin Hotel

9th and Chestnut Streets

The Ethical Culture Hall has been utilized by

a wide variety of leftist organizations over the years.

Among others, SANE, Women's International League for Peace

and Freedom, National Committee to Abolish the House Un-

American Activities Committee, Emergency Civil Liberties

Committee, Delaware Valley Committee for Democratic Rights,

etc., have met at Ethical Culture Hall.
