cause of Vlasenco's nationality, and the timing of the assassi

nation six months

after the blockade of Cuba, Kovacs concludes

that the assassination was ordered by "Brezhney and Fidel

Castro.".

e.

Vlasenco told Kovacs in November, 1963 that he

rented the apartment, dealt in precious stones, and had lived

there for four years.

Vlasenco was away from the apartment dur-

ing

the day,

dressed

well, had no family and no car.

Kovacs

guesses he saw him three times during the two week period.

Kovacs asked that the above story be passed to

Senator Edward Kennedy, and at first refused to identify himself

and the characters in his story to anyone but the Senator or

his emissary because he was afraid for his life.

It was for

that reason also that he claims he did not come

now.

Kovacs was assured that his story would not appear in

any newspaper or magazine (which he feared would happen), but

would be sent to Washington by a coded message.

end of the interview Kovacs alluded to his need for money

(CR $500,000 about US $11, 500) to fund his inventions; one a

dirigible which could

carry "any amount of cargo," and one a

pump which could pump liquids hundreds of miles.

When asked

if he had made an effort to interest local entrepreneurs, Kovacs

replied that he had expended considerable effort, "but they

laugh at me." Kovacs appears to have a confused

thinking

process and

lively imagination and his story is contradictory.

He probably came forward in the hope that his information

would be worth money.

We do not know whether he himself be

lieves the story he related.

In Rio de Janciro has been advised

to have no further contact with Kovacs.

Should addees wish to

pursue the matter, Kovacs' present address is Rua A. 46, VIla

Luiza, Pavuna, Rio de Janeiro.

This Agency has no identifiable traces on Kovacs or

Vlasenco.
