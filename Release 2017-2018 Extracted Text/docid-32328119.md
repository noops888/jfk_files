that a meeting of important people was being held in Havana

on that date concerning the gambling casino to be operated in the

Havana-Hilton Hotel which was soon to be opened.

Cellini stated'

that CLiFF JONES, former Lleutenant Governor of Nevada, Would be

at this meeting. m

On the same date, ALFRED FRANCIS, who is employed in the

casino at the Hotel Nacional, advised that JAKE LANSkY was meeting

with MEYER LANSKY in the latter's apartment located on Calle 12 in

the Vedado Section of Havana.

A spot check of the residence of

MEYER LANSKY on this same date reflected the presence of the

automobile of SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., at the apartment. Since

ERICKSON was in Havana on this date, it is highly possible that

he was in attendance at this meeting. m

It should ibe noted that both PCI Goffredo Cellini and

Arthur Newman, who works as credit manager in the casino at the

Hotel Nacional, have advised that BURT BRIGGS, who is employed as

a dealer at the Nacional, is FRANK ERICKSON's representative in

•Cuba.

at the Hotel Nacional

period of two hours on January
