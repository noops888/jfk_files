Union.

plained that morning about the conduct of the subject, advising that he

does practically no work and spends a great deal of his time in Union matters.

108 collected $6300 in dues in February at $1.50 per person and also colleeted

$2000 in initiation feeso

Of this amount, half goes to the International

Headquarters. He stated that the United Autonobile Workers are claiming that

the present officers of the local are ceasing to buy war funds with the dues

money collected and that he personally thinks that the dispute between the

two is due to the fact that: Local No. 108 1s a very rich local, supposedly

having about $27,000 investod in United States War Bonds. He further believes

that this is the reason why the International Headquarters of the Farm Equip

ment Union is interested In controlling tals local and keeping them in the

Farm Equipment Unfon due to the International Unlon's poor financial eireun®

stances as reflected in the report at the convention last fall.

mation regarding the construction of torpedoes for the Navy Department.

partment to expedite his removal.

Immediately following the appearance of

this article the members of the "left wing" of Local No. 108 held a meeting

and demanded the retraction of this article. Among those at this meeting was

TONY MATUZAR.

June 13, 1943 wAS TONY MATUZAK, and alSO BRUNO BARTNIK, WALTER KNYCHY and
