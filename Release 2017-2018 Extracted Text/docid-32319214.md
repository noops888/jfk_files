Administrative:

(U) Re HO EC dated 05/11/98, no lead set to

Athens in ACS. Enclosures inadvertently sent to Legat Rome.

Enclosures: (U) Enclosed for OPCA are the documents previously

provided to Legat Rome for review, which are being returned for

appropriate handling.

Details:

(Wre HQ Ec requested Legat Athens to provide

documents to an appropriate agency for review determination and

justification for postponement or approval for release.

On 8/10/98, discreet contact with General Marwan Zein

(protect), Commander, Beirut Police, failed to reveal additional

identifying data regarding the source of the information

contained in re EC, Colonel Nassib Abou-Shakra. (3)

As the Bureau

is aware, the security situation in Lebanon

remains tenuous at best.

It is clear to Legat Athens that

Colonel Abou-Shakra, not further identified, appears to have been

a source of the Bureau, whether a symbol source or merely an

ongoing Legat. contact.

Legat Athens does not currently have

access to records to verify this fact, particularly since the

source was contacted 34

years ago by. Legat. Rome, long before thes

TO:. OPCA

From:

Athens

Re: (U) 62-HQ-1029205, 08/11/1998

Legal Attache office in Athens was opened.

However, direct

contact with the Internal Security Forces in Lebanon with regard

to information provided to the FBI by a member of its agency, as

set forth in attachments to re EC, would merely serve

to place

the actual source of that information, if in fact he or she still

exists, in serious jeopardy. It should be noted, as the Bureau

is aware, the Lebanese Internal Security Forces are believed to

be penetrated by the syrian intelligence services. (5)

A review by Legat Athens of the information providedly (5)

apparently overclassified when received.

For the information of FBIHQ, Lon 8/7/98 CIA traces were

corducted ie abou-shakra, the results of whieh were incorelusives)

It is the recommendation of Legat Athens that the

information be released and made available, but that the source

of that information remain protected.

should OPCA or Legat Rome have any questions of follow-up

with regard to this matter, please contact Legat James P. Shaw,

telephone 011 30 1 725 3024.
