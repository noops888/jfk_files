On February 20, 1961, Mr. MINGO advised that he had

never before noticed these charges

incurred by other individuals

which

were included on the

BARTONE bill and had never therefore

asked subject about them.

MINGO said during all this time and up to the present

that BARTONE has never paid anything on his indebtedness.

Once

early in 1960 at the Theatrical Grill on Short Vincent Street

in Cleveland's tenderloin district, MINGO ran into ALEX "SHONDOR"

X BIRNS FBI 22529, Cleveland Police Department #20450), a

cleveland racketeer who had grown up in the same neighborhood

as MINGO in Cleveland.

MINGO asked BIRNS about BARTONE, but

MINGO

denied knowing him.

Later MINGO stated ARTHUR B._ "MICKEY"

MC BRIDE,, former Cleveland rackets figure, now owner of the

Yellow Cab Company, Cleveland.

At this time MINGO asked MC BRIDE

to have BIRNS help him collect his money from BARTONE.

Later

BIRNS saw MINGO, admitted

knowing BARTONE and said that subject

was now engaged

with ALVIN NAIMAN in the operation of a stone

quarry known as the Niagara Crushed Stone Company at Port

Ontario. BIRNS indicated that after they started

that time told him that subject's stone business had not

well and he had not been able to get up any money.

About two

weeks ago, MINGO called ALVIN NAIMAN at the Terminal Tower and

at this time NAIMAN told him BARTONE was now operating out of

the Sahara Motor Hotel, 3201 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland.

MINGO

said he had called there for BARTONE, but he was not in.

On January 6, 1961, CV I-4 advised that there was no

indication that subject had filed any income tax return since

one filed by him on June 5, 1958, at Toledo, Ohio, for the year

1957.
