MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Edmund Cohen

Assistant General Counsel

-- Involvement as Witness in

Gerald Patrick Hemming Case

a?

1. In the late afternoon on 7 January 1977, Mr.

informed the undersigned that he was being asked to attend a pre-trial

conference on 10 January in Miami, Florida, and expected to be a witness

for the Government in the case against Gerald Patrick Hemming. Mr.

stated that he had been under cover while employed by the Agency

from 1969 to 1974. He had then transferred to DEA where he became involved

with Mr. Hemming. Mr.

was now back with the Agency and expected

to be put under cover very shortly. Both for cover considerations and

because he felt the Hemming case had a great deal of "flap" potential,

rivaling the Werbell case, he desired OGC to intercede for him to keep him

from having to testify.

o3 noted that Hemming was a "walk-in", who was referred

to his boss at DEA, Mr. Conein, by Mr. Werbell and that Conein, in turn,

had sent Hemming to him to be interviewed. Subsequently, Mx. Hemming

had "set up" Mr. Conein by first telling him that a brother wished to work

with DEA and requesting permission to give Mr. Conein a resume, and later

by publicly meeting Conein and handing him a manila envelope ostensibly

containing the promised resume. In fact, the envelope contained a report

with phony cryptonyms representing Hemming as an agent of Conein's.

Hemming's report detailed a variety of alleged official getivities antoindicated

mentioned his prior contacts with Conein and with [

that Hemming would undoubtedly try to beat the narcotics charges pending

against him in Miami by claiming to be a DEA or CIA agent?'|

testimony that he was a DEA employee when he met him but was a CIA

employee both before and after would help cloud the issue. In addition,

such exposure could affect

current usefulness to the Agency.

learned that

3. The undersigned checked with Mr. Robert Blandford, CCS, and

cover had been removed when he left the Agency, thus

his previous service was a matter of public record. In addition, he was not

now under cover. Mr.

C/CCS, opined that no cover problem

existed which would impede

testimony.

03

4. The undersigned then spoke with Ms. Karen Atkinson, Assistant

U.S. Attorney in Miami (305) 350-5461, to inform her of Mr? current

status. Ms. Atkinson appreciated the potential problems, but concluded that

Mr

would be a necessary witness for the trial which was scheduled

to begin on ll January. The question of travel expenses was also broached.

Ms. Atkinson stated that she did not have an expense fund to pay the travel

employer Agency to pay the expenses of an employee testifying on behalf of

the Government about his official actions. The instant case was somewhat

unusual because CIA would be paying for MP.'

to, in effect, testify

about his DEA experiences, but she opined that this was

resolved in Washington.

5.

In view of the limited time available, the undersigned informed Mr.

branch chief,

of the above and suggested that travel

orders be cut for Mr.

trip to Miami.

03

6. On ll January, following his return from Miami, Mr.

informed the undersigned that Hemming's motion that his

trial be severed

from that of his various co-conspirators had been granted and, therefore,

his testimony had not been required. Ms. Atkinson had informed him that

should Hemming raise as a defense the allegation that he was a DEA agent,

would be called as a rebuttal witness. Ms. Atkinson also noted

that Hemming was alleging that DEA was representing him at the behest

of CIA because in the past he had "crossed" CIA.
