MI. Baron. MI. Halley, is it true that you are here

testifying today under allas, and that Halley is not ¿ctually

your true identity?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

Mr. Baron. Your true identity will be on file with the

Ieview staff of the CIA and available for verification by the

Committee if that becomes necessary?

• Mr. Halley. That is my understanding.

MI. Baron. Let me show you a piece of paper marked

"Statement Regarding Testimony and Alias" and let me ask you

whother this is

the statement you signed as we were beginning

here today which indicates your true identity and which I have

witnessed?

MI. Halley. . Yes, that is the correct statement that I

signed today. There is a blank there where we have not filled

in the Senator's name.

Mr. Baron.

All right.

For the moment, let us leave that blank and enter it into

the record as 1s, as Exhibit. 1.

(The document referred to

was marked Halley Exhitft

No. 1 for identification.)

Mr. Baron. It is your understanding, is it not, that we

have worked out an arrangement with the review ataff whereby

the statement will be attached to your transcript as an Exhibit

and in a sanitized form, leaving out either of the two raferences

to your true identity which will only be available at this

Agency•

Mr. Halley. That is my understanding.

Mr. Baron. Are you aware that you have the right to counsel

before the Committee?

Mr. Halley.

Yes, I am.

Mr. Baron. Are you appearing here, voluntarily here today

without counsel?

MI. Halley. Yes, I am.

MI. Baron. Are you also aware that at any point you are

entitled to chase answering any questions and consult with

counsel if you wish?

MI. Halley. Yes, I am aware of that.

MI. Baron. Finally, are you aware that all your constitu

tional rights are intact before the Committee here today,

including your Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent?

MI. Halley. Yes, I am.

MI. Baron. I think we should put into the record the

arrangement that we made before we began, and correct me if this

is not your understanding of the arrangement, that we are

testifying here today without placing you under oath hecause

point as soon as possible as it can be arranged after today's

Mr. Halley.

Yes. The statement that you have just made

is my understanding of the agreement that we entered into prior

to this conversation going on the record.

MI. Baron. Thank you.

Let us begin then with some veryibroad questiong. • ...

about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you

were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with tha

IMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in

approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-

quarters. I was Chief of Foreian Intelligence Activities for the

Eastern European Division. I was asked to be released from those

duties to conduct a survey of the opportunitles for running

Intelligence operations against Cuba.

I was released from those

duties: I did engage in a survey of the possibilities for running

intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary operations

against Cuba.

MI. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence

for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? That was

your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,

is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

I want to quality that. Undoubtedly, there were some

actions that were being

conducted in the Fastern European area

that reflected on Cuba, but I was not involved in the Bay of Pigs

operation. I as not fully focused on Cuban operations until

approximately February of 1962.

MI. Baron. At what point did you join the Agency?

Mr. Ilallay. I joined the Agency originally in 1951.

Mr. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the

nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of '629

Mr. Halley. When I was first assigned to the Agency, I was

an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency

training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities

where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations.

I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany.:. In the

course of that service, I spent most of my time working on the

Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in

Soviet operations and East German operations.

Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American

affairs prior to February of '62?

Mr. lialley. Yes. In the period 1960-62; I was responsible

for setting up operational activity in Latin America that

This was in a period of time

were expanding their

presance in Latin America.

I was responsible for gettina this nongram voing in

Latin America, so I did have an extensive axposure to Latin

America: in the period '60 to '62, as I recall those dates.

The accuracy of those dates can he chacked from my official

travel records, and so on.

Mr. Baron. During that period of time you were actually

in Latin America helping to set up this program?

MI. Halley. No, I was stationed in Washington, but I

travelled to Latin America during this particular period of

time.

MI. Baron. Did you travel to Cuba at any point during the

course of that operation?

Mr. Halley.

Not specifically. I think I transitted Cuba

on air stops being routed to various countries. I think I was

at one or two Cuban airfields, but simply in transit.

Mr. Baron.

Not long enough even to talk to the people at

• the Station in Cuba?

MI. Halley. No, I had no contact at any time with the

lavana Station.

Mr. Baron. Did you pick up, during this perlod of time,

a general sense of the attitude of Latin American governments

toward the Castro government? Could you characterize that

attituda, if you did?

Mr. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad

political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was

much more narrowly focused at that time on

and I was not certainly

specializing in Cuban affairs at that juncture.

Mr. Baron. Cuba was

not viewed at that juncture as part of

the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?

Mr. Halley. No, it was not.

Mr. Baron. Coming then to February of '62, is that the

point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?

Mr. Halley. No.

When I first entered into this survey,

It was to do this on a IDY basis, temporary duty assignment:

to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that

particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task

Force that was

attempting to expand intelligence coverage of

Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular

point in time.

MI. Baron. At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completed this survey.

These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into

a permanent assignment. I would have to check the exact dates

from my service records, but after having completed the survey

report, shortly thereafter I was asked to go to Miami to become

permanently assigned to the station in Miami. I do not recall

the exact date at which that parmanent change of station took

place.

Mr. Baron. Would you assume that that was sometime before

the end of May of '62?

Mr. Halley. Yes.

It was probably before that, but as I

say, there are a couple of weeks gap that we would have to 100k

at my service record to get the exact dates, but certainly it

could have been March, it could have been April: But I reserve,

you know, the right to check my record if that is a critical

point in terms of what you are trying to astablish.

Mr. Baron. Certainly.

I should

say generally at this point, if anything we cover

today gives you that kind of problem it would be immensely

helpful to us if you would

check your answers against documents

that might be available in the CIA.

MI. Halley. Yes, all right.

MI. Baron. In fact, let me ask you if you would check that

one out, because it would be useful to know exactly when you

joined the JMWAVE station.

During the period of time before you jolned JMVAVE, while

you were conducting the survey, did you report to anyone other

than William Harvey?

Mr. Halley. In a formal sense, this TDY was conducted on

behalf of the task force commander, who was MI. Harvey. While

I was in Miami conducting the survey, I obviously discussed

matters pertaining to that survey to the team who was then in

charge of the operational activity in Miami. That team was

essentially headed by Mr. Al Cox,.who has since died.

Mr. Baron. Was that team the equivalent of IMWAVE station?

Mr. lialley. Yes. Mr. Cox was the head, then, of what would

be the equivalent of the JMWAVE Station.

• Mr. Baron.

Was he the head of JMWAVE until the pint when

you replaced him, or until the point. you became Chief of the

JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.. He was the head of that

unit until such time as I replaced him.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware during this survey that you

were conducting of any link between Task Force W and the so-called

Special Group in the White House which was part of the National

Security Council

structure and used the project namer: MONGOOSE

for anti-Cuban operations?

MI. Halley. My understanding at the time that I conducted

this survey was that there was a three-man group in existence

which was headed by Mr. Robert Kennedy that was conducting a

survey to see what kind of activities could be conducted against

Cuba. The other members of that particular group were General

Lansdale and Mr. Helms.

This three-man group had subordinate to it for all practical

purposes the task force

unit which was managed by Mr. Harvey.

I am not familiar, however, with the other terminology that you

used, that is Project MONGOOSE, or whatever you said. I do not

know the exact words you usad. I am not familiar with that

terminology.

Mr Baron... During the whole period of your involvement

with JMWAVE, you were not made aware of Project MONGOOSE as

such?

MI. Halley. I am not aware of Project MONGDOSE. I do not

recall it as an acronym, cryptonym or anything else that was in

common usage in my conversations.

Also, you have to understand that during that particular

time, Mr. Harvey was subordinate to the normal Agency chain of

command. In other

words, he had parallel lines, if you will.

There was this three-man Task Force to whom he was reporting

regularly. At the same time, as the Task Force Commander, he

was reporting to the then-DDP who was Mr. Helmg.

Mr Baron. You began your survey just about the time that

MI. Helms replaced Mr. Bissell as DDP?

Mr. Halley. That is right.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of the command relationship

•between the three-man

group that you have mentioned and william

Harvey as head of Task

Force W?

Did that group task Harvey

directly, or did Harvey's assignments have to come through Helms

and through the DCI as opposed to this group that did not include

the DCI?

Mr. Halley. My understanding of it at the time was we were

really talking about parallel lines. In other words, this

three-man group was meeting. Mr. Helms was both a member of

that particular group and the DDP. Therefore, when he came

back

from

one of

these meetings and issued instructions to Mr. Harvey,

It was, you know, tantamount to these things coming through two

channels simultaneously, one coming from this three-man task

force and the other instruction simultaneously coming from Mr.

Helms who was the DDP.

Mr. Baron. As far as Mi. Harvey was concerned, an assign-

ment or order from Richard Helms was an order to be taken at

face value? Harvey did not have to question whether it had the

stamp of approval from the DCI or not? Would that have been

your operating understanding?

Mr. Halley. That would have been my understanding, yes.

Certainly an instruction received from Mr. Helms was a valia

Agency instruction.

Mr. Baron. The DCI at this point was John McCone.

MX. Hallay. That is correct.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of the relationship

• between this three-man group and John McCone at that point?

Mr. Ilalley. Not on a day to day basis. Once I went to

Miami, I came back on a regular basis to review operational

plans and programs. On one occasion I accompanied Mr. McCone

to the White llouse to give a presentation or sit in while the

presentation was being made.

Mr. Baron. Where was this? What was the forum in which

the presentation was made.

Mr. Halley.

This was

a meeting with President Kennedy and

other members of the then-Cabinet were present at that particular

meeting.

Mr. Baron. Was that a Cabinet meeting or was it a Special

Group meeting as a sub-unit of the National Security Council?

Mr. Halley. You know, that happened in 1962. This is

1975. I do not recall then with precision as to whether it was

a meeting of the Cabinet or whether it was a meeting of the

National Security Council, or whether it was a meeting of the

Special Group.

Mr. Baron. That: is perfectly understandable. Do you recall

which Cabinet members were present at that meeting?

Mx. Halley. Yes.. My

recollection of that was that Mr.

McNamara was present, Mr. Rusk was present, Mr. Kennedy, the

Attorney General, was present. You know, I am just vague now

at this particular point. Those are the ones that stick out in

my memory as being present.

Mr. Baron. Was the DCI present?

Mr. Halley. Yes, the DCI was present, and he gave a

portion of the presentation. As I recall, Mr. FitzGerald gave

the other portion of the

presentation.

Mr. Baron. Who at that point replaced William Harvey as

Chief of Task Force W?

Mr. Hallay. Right. You know, the chronology of the Chiefs

of our task force were that it was Harvey, then FitzGerald,

then

after that,

I served with all four of those

This was a very active period, you know, with precision, I cannot

outline for you today the dates when Harvey left and FitzGerald

took over, you know, when FitzGerald left and

took over

and so forth. This is something that I would have to research

to give you the precise dates.

Mr. Baron. What was the substance of this meeting that

they had in which the President was present?

Mr. Halley. This was a general revlew of activitles that

were being conducted against Cuba.

MI. Baron. Was there any mention of any assassination

effort at that meeting?

Mr. Halley.

No, there was not.

Mr. Baron. You were attending at that point ir connection

with the survey you conducted?

Mr. Halley. No. I was attending at that point as the

Station Chief from Miami in order to make a contribution to the

issues that were being discussed, to the fact that detailed,

substantive back-up for whatever questions might be put to the

Agency spokesmen. I made reference to that because you asked

me if I knew the relationship between MI. McCone and this

three-man group. I said no, on a day-to-day basis I did not

know the relationship, but that there were meetings that ware

group.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that that group might have gone

by any particular name or designation?

Mr. Halley. No, I am not:

Mr. Baron. You are not familiar with the term Special

Group?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I am aware of the term Special Group.

I am aware that the chronology of the 303 Committee, Special

Group, 40. Committee and so forth, but as I mentioned to you

earlier, that particular time, I cannot distinguish between

whether this was an ad hoc meeting or this was a Special Group

meeting, or what it was.

Mr. Baron. Did you assume at that time that the three-man

group that you referred to, including the Attorney General,

General Lansdale and Richard Helms, had a formal relationship

to this larger Special Group? In other words, was that three-

man group a kind of decision-making sub-unit of the Special

Group, or do you think it operated entirely independent from

the National Security Council structure.

Mr. Halley. I do not think I can give you an authoritative

answer to that. I would go back to what I previously told

you. When I entered into this project in February of '62, the

chain of command that. I was familiar with was this three-man

group in constant contact with Mr. Harvey. The second chain

of command, paralleling that, was Mr. Harvey reporting to the

DDP and the DDP subsequently reporting through his chain of

command to the Director, and that would be the only way that

I could characterize that with any accuracy.

MI. Baron. Did those two chains of command continue"..

as the channels of decision-making and tasking when you were..

or during your tenure as Chief of Station.at JMWAVE?"

MI. Halley. That relationship changed, and again I do

not have the date at my fingertips at what time that changed.

I know that shortly thereafter I was in Miami, Genaral

Lansdale came down to visit me, to talk with me, about the

progress that was being made in the operational program. At

some point after that, this three-man group for all Intents

and purposes disappeared. General Lansdale was reassigned;

the group broke up; subsequent reviews of the program were made

at the Special Group level. As an example, we would have to

submit every month the number of operations that we were going

to run, such as infiltrations into Cuba through what would be

paramilitary means, and these were approved by the Special

Group. There was an approval procedure for setting those up,

so subsequently the three-man group disappeared and the regular

mechanism of the Special Group came into play.

would you say that every major operation that you undertook

at INvAve would have been approved by the special Group or at

least they would have been put on notice of the nature of any

major operation that you were planning?

Mr. Halley. Why do you not define for me what you consider

to be a major operation so we do not get into, you know, a

problem? If'you feel that you cannot do 'chatr'.

Mr. Baron.

Perhaps we can turn it around and say, could

you characterize the kinds of operations generally that you

would refer to this three-man group initially, in the Special

Group later, for their approval, or at least to put them on

notice,. the kinds that you might not refer and instead proceed

unilaterally?

Mr. Halley. Initially, the three-man group was seized

with the problem of conducting the survey of what could be

done against Cuba. As soon as that was more or less agreed

upon, my understanding of this, as I told you, the three-man

group was disbanded or atrophied or went on to other things

and then the formal mechanism came in for approval, that is,

the Special Group. As procedures. became more formalized, we

had to submit a monthly schedule of the kind of operations that

In other words, if we were going to run an operation that

was going to be a cache raplacement in the Cuban mainland, that

had to be put In, say in our October schedule, that october

schedule had to be submitted to the Washington Headquarters so

they could make it available to the Speciali Group sometime in

September.

of

operation in terms of sensitivity, and then you could

MI. Baron. If there had been any operation with the

assassination of Fidel Castro, or other high Cuban government

Leaders as its objective, would such an operation have been

referred to either the three-man group or later the Special

Group.

MI. Halley. If such an operation had been proposed. from

Miami; it would have had to have gone through that particular

process.

operations that originated at the JMVAVE Station would!

That was

During that particular perlod of time, my firsthand knowledge

of these events would be, if that kind of operation were to go

forward. it would have had to go through this approval mechanism,

it would have had to have been some formal action taken. If it

were something that certainly would - for some reason might not

orally from Miami, the chain of command would have been from me

to whomever was the head of the Task force in Hashington, or

later, when the Task Force became reintegrated Into the Western

Hemisphere Division, I would have had to talk to the Chief of

the Western Hemisphere Division, who at one time was fitzGerald.

MI: Baron. But a plan that originated at the CIA above

the level of the Chief of Station at JMWAVE would not necessarily

have been referred to Special Group for approval, is

that

correct?

Mr. Halley. I have no firsthand knowledge of that, there-

fore I am.trying to restrict myself to those things that I have

personal knowledge of. In other words, that is the kind of

thing that I think you should talk to, you know, those

who were

or others who would be able to give youl a better

perception of that.

I want to make one point here, that once I went

I was a regular visitor to Washington, but always for one or

my associates. Therefore, I was not aware of the urstiand

Mr. Baron. Do you have any personal knowledge of any

Mr. Halley. No, I do not.

MI. Baron. Do you have firsthand knowledge of any operation

as an assassination effort?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not have any firsthand

kriowledge.

You also have to put this in a historical perspective. In

other words, from what I have read in the Press since then,

obviously I could put certain things together. You are asking

me in this timeframe, 1962 to 1965, did I have any firsthand

•knowledge at that particular time?

Mr. Baron. Exactly.

Mr. Halley. The answer to that is no, I did not.

You also have to put yourself in the historical context of

that particular time. Thousands of refugees were coming out of

Any number of thase people had plans or ideas for changing the

in Cuba ware plans to assassinate any number of people in Cuba.

This was something that was talked about, you could go down to

So I do not want to leave you with the impression that the

word assassination never came across my radar screen, : but we

tives, whether the primary objective or not, the assassination

of Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, or Che Guevara, which was run with

CIA Involvement?

Mr. Halley. I would like to phrase that question slightly

differently, because I think, you know, you have several things

tied together. I would like to answer your question this way.

During my tenure in Miami, I did not put forth any proposals

to mount an assassination operation. In other words, there

was no formal plan, I did not put forth any operational proposals

along this line.

Secondly, I am

not aware of any assassination plans being

put forth, you know, by Mr. Harvey or by anyone else at that

particular time. That is the way I would prefer to answer that.

Mr. Baron. What kind of problem did you have with the

question as it was •asked?

Mx. Halley. Well, you lumped a number of things together.

• I am trying to separate these out. In other words, you put in

there a secondary or tertiary consideration.

MI. Baron. Right, I am interested in that.

Mr. Halley. That is what bothers me, because I did not

put forth any plans. On the other hand, I do not want to be

held responsible for such things as CIA being in touch with a

paramilitary group in Cuba whose primary mission was the

collection of intelligence, whose secondary mission might be to

organize a resistance and, unbeknownst to me, might have had

their own ideas which were never consulted with us, you know,

never discussed with us, through the communications channels

that we had, who may have been thinking, may have planned, and

may have attempted, to implement assassination operations.

I do not feel under the command and control mechanism that

existed that I could exercise through the Station over such a

situation that I could be held responsible for that. Therefore,

I cannot accept your question on the secondary or tertiary

situation because I have

no knowledge of those. You may have

some knowledge and you can confront me with some statement by

some Cuban who said that this was part of his mission. I have

to look at that at the time.

MI. Baron.

We will go

over some statements, but in trying

to recover this ground one more time, I think it is important

to distinguish an attempt to pin the responsibility on you,

which I am not trying to do by my questioning

Mr. Halley.. That is a complicated question.

Mr. Baron. The attempt to simply - undoubtedly, the

attempt to simply bring out your knowledge and any awareness

that you may have had of any kind of operation that had assassina-

tion as one of its objectives, and also involved the CIA to

any extent. That is what I am asking you for.

Mr. Halley. Right, and I will stand by my answer; that 18,

I put forth no plans, I know of no plans put forth, you know,

during my tenure in Miami In which assassination was part of

the operational rationale. You know, the only way we can clarify

this perhaps to your satisfaction is to discuss some specifics.

If you are prepared to talk about specifies, maybe I can deal

with those within the framework of that general statement that

I made, you know. I know how Cubans talk. I know the rumors

that have existed over the years. I simply do not want to be

identified with any action conducted by some group over which

I had no knowledge or control. That is my key point.

Mr. Baron. I think that answers it for now, and we will

cover some specifics later.

One more question on this dual chain of command: on the

one hand, the Agency chain of command from the DDP to Harvey

to you at JMWAVE, and on the other hand, the three-man decision

making group consisting of the Attorney General, Landale

and

Helms. Would you say in the early days that this three-man

group appeared to you to be in control of the decision making

before the Special Group stepped in, that decisions were made

in a less formal way than they were later under the Special

Group?

Mr. Halley. I really could not address myself to that.

In other words, I never sat in on a meeting of the three-man

group. In other words --

Mr. Baron. What about the kind of rsporting that was

required of you by the three-man group as opposed to the Special

Group?

MI. Halley. My requirements for reporting really stemmed

In the early days from Harvey. If there were any special

requirements, he was taking them from the three-man group and

translating them and, in fact, much of the system of reporting

in those early days was generated by me.and what:I'thought.".

record that I worked for Mr. Harvey prior to 1962 and therefore

I was familiar, you know, with his style of operation and thoughe

I had a clear understanding of what he needed in an informational

sense. So when I went to Miami, I organized much of the

reporting flow upward, if you will, from the

field unit to

Headquarters.

operating?

Mr. Halley. Yes.

I worked with him -- I think the date is

somewhere':in June or July of '54 to somewhere in "59. I would

have to look that up in the record, the exact date.

Mr. Baron. But you say you not only had a close working

relationship with MI. Harvey, but you came to be a personal

friend of his?

Mx. Halley. Yes, I would like to say I am a personal friend

of MI. Harvey.

Mr. Baron. Returning to your statements about the chain

of command, you seem to be saying that Mr. Harvey served as the

funnel for both of these chains of command; as far as you were

concerned, you received directives from him, whatever the source

may have been originally, is that correct?

Mr. Halley. Correct.

I want to make a point. Insofar as the three-man group was

concerned, I would see Helms in his tole as the DDP in the three-

•man group. I would see Lansdale - as I told you, Lansdale came

down to visit me in Miami on one occasion. He came as part of

that three-man group.

But my chain of command during my

visit was still from me to Harvey. Lansale was down there,

I was to be, you know, straightforward, candid, discuss plans,

programs, problems. But I received my orders and instructions

the control of money and so forth was vested in the Task Force

Commander, Mr. Harvey.

Therefore, I never

dealt with this three-man group as a

body. I dealt with the individuals, you know, and various

mutations.

Mr. Baron. Would you say that the three-man group had

less formal, more free-wheeling style of decision making, it

there was a real change in the rigor with which you were required

to report after the Special Group took over?

Mr. Halley. I would have to say that the total reporting

became more formalized the longer we stayed in business. I

cannot ascribe this to the difference of style of the three-man

group as opposed to the Agency chain of command or subsequent

with the requirements of the Special Group. This evolved from

a body of experience that was gained as the operation was

established and got some experience.

So I would not want to characterize that as being a result

of the groups.

MI. Baron. You did not have any problem with the proprlety

'of the three-man group iri the early stages?

Mx. Halley. No, I had no reason to believe that it was

not a duly constituted body. In other words, their officers that

I reported to in that particular case, Mr. Harvey, Mr. Helms,

were my chain of command at that particular point, were the

ones who briefed me on the existence of this three-man body

It was a substantive management operation,

Mr. Baionv.. What perlod of time would you place this in?

Mr. Malley. Probably sometime. In the surimer of '62,

because my family was already in Miami at that point, and when

I first went to Miami my family was not with me. I think my

wife joined me in Miami somatime in the summer of '62, you know,

I would have to research that. It is obviously avallable from

Was there any discussion whether direct or

indirect of assassination of Cuban leaders during your meetings

with General Lansdale?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall any such conversations. You

bit on this perspective? I would like to try to focus on the

perspective for you in the historical setting.

are doing is an isolation out of context - at that meeting that

you attanded, with the Cabinet members and the President, was

there any discussion either directly or indirectly or by means

of any circumlocutions:..of the subject of assassination?

Bruce

presence at the meeting there was nothing discussed about

Mr. Baron. Was there any such discussion between yourself

and John McCone or Richard

Helms at any point?

Mr. llalley. I never recall discussing assassinations with

John NcCone. Now, in terms of discussions with Richard Helms,

these were conversations in which atmospherics in Miami and

I cannot remember a specific date, you know, some time at

which that was discussed, and you know I never received any

instruction from Helms to mount an assassination operation.

MI. Baron. Again, I am not trying to unfairly pull these

kinds of ::conversations out of their historical context. Before

we flesh out the historical context, do you have any recollection

of the manner in which assassination might have come up between

yourself and Helms?

Mr. Halley.

Again, I put it in this overall context of

the times. We were.runnindForeign.Intelligerce.collectton..r:

involved in paramilitary operations that could be described as

commando raids. Those were the kinds of activities.

We were dealing with exile groups, we were debriefing

refugees and in all of this conversations of assassination,

the Cuban penchant for it had to come up. I cannot pinpoint -

MI. Baron. You do not recall any reference of means

to

be used or people to be involved?

Mr. Hallay. No. Even such things as discussions of

various kinds of weapons, you know, people, as you probably

know from this experience, every individual who deals with

weapons has a different view on what is the ideal weapon. If

you took a squad of ten men and gave them the free choice, I

am sure all ten of them would come up with a different weapon.

Therefore, when we were standardizing weapons to our

of the weapon for the Cuban to carry, because many of them were

quite small. In this context, people would discuss what is

the range, can a guy use it to shoot somebody at a particular

range? Is this an assassination weapon? Is this a good weapon

for close combat?

Therefore the term assassination was just a part of the life,

of the fabric at that time. That is what I am trying to get

across.. I just cannot articulate any more eloquently than

that.

Mr. Baron. I think you are being quite eloquent and

extremely informative. You mentioned that the phrase assassina-

tion would be used in the discussions about the kinds of weapons

that would be used for commando raids or equipping your

operatives.

Mr. Halley. Paramilitary teams, right.

MI. Baron. Was the capacity of a weapon to be used as

' an assassination weapon among other uses a desirable capacity?

In other words, was that phrase used positively?

Mx. Halley. No, it was not. It is the kind of thing

that weaves itself into, you know, a conversation.

For instance, if you are planning a commando raid against

something like an oil refinery, you have to think about how are

implanting your :target and the guard stumbles on you, you know,

the guard force then becomes an

"Immediate: risk to your operation

and usually there is a fire fight. Therefore, this becomes a

question of weapons. In othar words, what weapon is going to

give the highest muzzle velocity and make the largest amount of

rate of fire and one made less rate of noise than the other

for that job you would pick the weapon with

the lowest noise.

You might even silence it. You may make a silenced

These are the kinds of things that go into these discussions

of weapons.

Ms. Baron: The technology of assassination and targetted

shooting, are you referring to -- when you say

weapon - to a weapon generally capable of targetted shooting?

Mr. Halley. In this particular context, I think most

people felt that the Cuban penchant for assassination, for

discussing

assassination, was the kind that would have to be

done from a long range.

You know, I think that it is generally an accepted thesis

that a group of dedicated men who are prepared to give their lives

can in time assassinate almost anybody. Now, the Cuban was not

that kind of a person. That-was.not his psychological make-up.

He tends to want to liva, to enjoy life, to talk about his

accomplishment. Therefore, while they ware brave and dedicated,

they were the kind of people who would probably engage in

something like this in the context of using the sniper weapon

as a vehicle for assassination, long distance.

Therefore, in this context you are talking about range, you

know, one of the key factors becomes what is the accurate range

of a weapon if fired by an expert marksman. Therefore, that is

the kind of thing that would go into, you know, discussions of

weapons.

Mr. Baron. When you were discussing weapons with high

range and low muzzle velocity, was this ever discussed in the

context of shooting Fidel Castro or other key Cuban leaders as

opposed to targetted shooting on a commando raid.

MI. Halley. I can recall, you know, no conversation in

which it was narrowly focused on the question of Fidel Castro.

MI. Baron. Let us go back, then, to putting this all

into historical context. I am going to ask you if you can

explain more about the structure of the IMWAVE Station, both

the channels lupward.": from you to the Agency and the Special

Group and the channels downward from you to your operatives,

if in the course of explaining the structure, you would like to

appreciated.

MI. Halley. I think what I would like to do is to try to

put this into some perspective.

The perspective really starts with the failure of the Bay

of Pigs Operation. After the failure of the Bay of Pigs, the

Kennedy Administration wanted another look taken at the problem

of Cuba. In order to get that other look started, the Kennedy

Administration created this three-man task force or this three-

man group and wanted to see what else could be done against

Cuba, and that is when I came into this problem in February of

'62.

MI. Baron. Is it possible that the three-man group that

you are referring to is actually the Robert Kennedy-Maxwell

Taylor Board of Inquiry into the reasons for the fallure of the

Bay of Pigs operation?

Mr. Halley. This three man group stemmed out. of that

inquiry. What its relationship was to the inguiry, I do not know,

because I was not involved and I never had an opportunity once

I plunged into this job, to go back and read those historical

documents. You know, I am sure there is a Maxwell Taylor Report,

and so forth; but I have never read it.

All right.

Therefore, my first task wher I became involved in this

was the task of coming up with an operational plan to see what

kinds of intelligence could be collected in Cuba, so that by

collecting this intelligence, an assessment could be made based

on hard facts as to what could be done against Castro. In other

words; the difference here was that people thought that the Bay

of pigs operation was not soundly grounded in intelligence.

Therefore, this was an attempt to start the collection of

Intelligence to see what could be done.

In order to collect intelligence at that particular time,

it was belleved that all avenues of approach

should be used,

so that meant classical foreign intelligenca operations,

counterintelligence operations, the debriefing of refugees, and

the use of paramilitary means to put teams into Cuba to collect

Intelligence on that part of the island that could not be

covered by what you would call the more classical means of

foreign intelligence collection.

As the program was started

essentially by me or accelerated

by me, we in fact got caught up with the Cuban Missile Crisis --

that is, the advent of the soviet intervention into Cuba -- and

our whole effort shifted to covering that soviet build-up in

Cuba, and this was an integral part to our having detected the

Soviet build-up and the United States government taking the

actions which they did, that is, to verify this.

There was a great problem for a while when ve were all

talking about hard intelligence, the President, John Kennady,

was telling us, give us hard intelligence. We thought we were

giving him hard intelligence. What he meant, in his definition

of hard intelligence, as it turned out to ba, was a U-?

•:Then we got caught up into the ayeball to eyeball confron-

tation of the Cuban Missile Crisis. When that was over, we

got caught up with the problem of monitoring the disengagement

of the soviet presence in Cuba. That took us up through sometime

Into sarly '63.

Then we took a look again, because we knew an awful lot

more about them than we had when we started in February of '62,

to see what could be done against Cuba, and it was clear at

that point that no external invasion was going to be possible,

because that was something that was excluded by the Khruschev-

Kennedy agreement and then it was not feasible. In any event,

therefore it was a question of what could be done.

So we were

collecting intelligence to continue to stay on top of the

situation. We were attempting to establish contacts with the

military establishment in Cuba to see if there was any force

that was opposed to Castro within the military establishment

that would be used to alter the situation and continue to see

whether there were any economic pressures that could be brought

on. Cuba that would accelerate the whole problem of creating

an environment in which a resistance could be created on an

island.

that point when Castro had consolidated his strength

when the United States and Russia reached an agrenment that no

external invasion of Cuba would take place, did you turn

primarily to the ways and means of finding & dissident group

within Cuba that might be capable of overthrowing Castro

number ont, and number two, of finding means of undermining

the economic strength of the Castro government.

MI. Halley. In addition, we were continuing to support

certain elements of resistance, you know, that were still there

that were not in the Army.

Mr. Baron. What kinds of elements were those?

Mr. Halley. These were paramilitary forces that were in

Cubi, that we had put in or established contact with, or people

who were already in the bush who we had already established

contact with or they had established contact with us, and we

were providing them with food, weapons ind so forth so that they

could survive. So that it was a multifaceted approach at that

particular time.

That went on

from the middle of '63 until the middle of

'65, and these are two distinct phases of this operation. In

effect, one, a survey, and two, the Missile Crisis and

itg

post-mortem, and then the next phase was the continuation of

Intelligence collection, the working or taking the sounding with

military dissidents, economic pressure, and working with

natural dissident elements that were still on the island.

Mr. Baron. Can we turn now to the structure of the JMWAVE

Station and explain that a bit? How large was the Station?

What was the command structure within the Station?

Mr. Halley. The Station started expanding in whatever

timeframa it was, somewhere after the survey was completed. It

must have started expanding sometime in March of 1962. You

know, by the time that it was at its peak, which was probably

somewhere just before the Cuban Missile Crisis, July, August

of 1962, it was either the largest of the second largest - my

recollection was that it was the second largest station in

existence at that time. I would not want to be pinned down

Did you have other agents of operatives among

the Cuban community or outside the Cuban community that were

affillated with the station although not employed by it

directly?

Mr. Halley. I think we are going to have to define some

tarms.

Mr. Baron. What I am trying to do now is simply get a

picture of the scope of the Station's strength and to its

activities, how many people the Station had to call upon for

its activities.

MI. Halley. Well, let me try to give you an answer, because

What am I talking

about? These would be essentially Cubans who were the captains

of the vessles that were used in infiltration operations to

put people on the shore of Cuba, and there were a variety of

techriques. In other words, you might start on with the mother

ship, which would be an LCI -- I am not sure how familiar you

are with various kinds of vessels.

Mr. Baron. What is an LCI?

Mr. Halley. Landing craft kind of vessle, or a patrol

craft, a PC, 1l0-foot vessle, that would be a mother ship.

This is the kind of ship that would

take fuel supplies and

water, so that other smaller vessels could be serviced by it.

So you might start with an operation of a mother ship towing a

smaller boat, or having

It on its decks and going down to

fifteen or twenty miles from Cuha, putting the smaller boat

or violating local law in some othor way, who were

agencies?

Mr. Halley. You have asked me, in essence, three

questions.

Mr. Baron.

Right:

Mr. Halley. Let me try to divide that and deal with each

question separately.

Let ma first deal with the vessels. Every vessel that we

had

was appropriately registered. There were no short-cuts:

insofar as the U.S. Coast Guard was concerned. That is, any

vessel that was registered in the United States met appropriate

safety standards and so forth, so we were not putting any

vessels into the water that any citizen could not have put into

the water. That is we are talking about ten, fifteen, twenty

foot boats, thirty foot boats, thirty-five foot boats, things

like that. These boats were owned in elther a corporato name

or by a private individual who had to register them with the

Coast Guard and pass normal Coast Guard

regulations.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Baron. To continue with this, I understand that

safety regulations would have been complied with, but was there

some sort of immunity from inspection, say inspection for

carrying armaments aboard a vessel that the CIA had arranged

with maritime authorities, or local law enforcement authorities?

Ms. Halley. When we had operations going, these were

coordinated with the Coast Guard In terms of their knowing that.

you know, at a particular date, time group, that there would be

a rendezvous between two vessels which were our vessels, and

this was coordinated with the Coast Guard.

Mr. Baron. Would you return to the second part of that

large question? Without reference to vessels, were CIA

employees or agents on the streets of cities in Southern

Florida immune from search

or arrest by local law enforcement

authorities?

MI. Halley. They were

not immune.

Let me ask to dispel one myth that I think has developed

which is reflected in your question.

We were meticulous to

insure that no weapons were issued to anybody until the men

ware on the vessel outside of the immediate waters of south

Florida, and we were meticulous to insure that when they came

back from a mission that they were met at sea and all the

weapons were taken away from them.

So, when you talk about a group moving around in Florida,

our control in the state of Florida, is just not correct.

This was all carefully controlled and they did not have their

weapons when they came back, we took them before they landed,

so they were not immune.

MI. Baron. You did have general arrangements or agreements

with law enforcement agencies throughout Florida for the

treatment of CIA operatives who were affillated with the JMNAVE

Station?

MI. Halley. We did have, through our office of Security,

a continuing dialogue with a number of law enforcement agencies

in Florida. If a problem developed, we would then contact them

and look at the issue

within the context of what had transpired.

Certainly there was no immunity. In other words, this has to be

looked at on a case by case basis.

For instance, you know, we had a training site in north

Florida, as an example. If somebody came off of that site that

was drunk and disorderly in town and could not speak English,

the local authorities did have a number to call to raise this

with us to see whether this was somebody that was of interest

to us, and then we would have to go and settle that particular

case.

MI. Baron. Back to the structure of the relationships

between yourself as Chief of Station at JMWAVE and any operatives

or employees who worked underneath you at that Station, would

It be fair to say that any activities run out of the Station

ultimately were channeled out through you?

MI. Halley. They should have been, and they were -- you

know this Station went through

several mutations in organization

during its existence. I guess the organizational structure that

existed for the longest period of time was something like I

am

going to describe to you.

There was a Chief of Station, which was myself. I had

Deputy Chiaf of Station for operations. That is the gentleman

who is now retired,

I think he is still alive, by the name of

I had

a second Deputy Chief of Station and

he was for Support

Patterns.

That is a gentleman who is

also

retired,

Then the rest

of the Station was organized into a number of

branches. Each branch was organized along functional lines.

Let me give you an example.

There was a Foreign Intelligence

Branch. These were

people in, what in my terminology would be

classical foreign intelligence operations. That is, trying to

Itcruit a . Cuban diplomat abroad, as

an example, dealing with,

you know, a Uruquayan diplomat in the Uruguayan Embassy in

Havana. They are working with resident agents in Cuba who might

live in some city like llavana and have a legal job as a baker or

butcher or something but had a radio set in which they could •

communicate with us, through which they could communicate to us.

Then there wag the Paramilitary Branch.

This was the

group that ran the commando operations. This was the group that

ran, and put people back into Cuba, into resistance groups, or

established contact with resistance groups. This was a group

that also worked in putting in caches that would supply people,

either paramilitary forces in Cuba or agents that were being

run by the Foreign Intelligence Group.

All right. Then there was a Covert Action, people who

dealt with exiled refugee groups that were involved in radio

activities, publications, that kind of thing. Then there is a

whole panoply of -- then there was Maritime, in terms of

fInance, and so on. Security was a branch. Obviously, under

that kind of system, no executive, whether he is president of

a corporation or a Station Chief, can

see every single piece of

paper that comes in of out, but clearly there was a review

procedure whereby program reviews were conducted, individual

operational reviews were conducted.

Mr. Baron. By yourself?

Mr. Halley. By myself. I do not want to leave you with

the impression that I knew every single thing that was going

on evary minute

and could account for the activities.of

employees on a daily basis.

with the Station a moment ago, I think we may have craated a::

misimpression that the only people involved in CIA operations

were people who were paid by the Agency. Isn't it also true

that there were many members of Cuban exile groups in Florida

who participated voluntarily from time to time in CIA sporisored

operations?

Mr. Halley. I think that you may have to sharpen that up

for me. I am not sure what you really maan.

If you are talking about foreign intelligence collections,

you know, the people who were producing --

Mr. Baron. I am talking now about the paramilitary

operations.

Let me make sure that we understand each other, because

during this period of time there were a lot of independent

Cuban groups who claimed that they had sponsorship from the

Agency but did not, and were operating, and there was a period

in time when these groups could not run their operations from

Florida without running the risk of being picked up by Customs,

Immigration, Coast Guard, the FBI, or if we had information on

it, you know, we might pass the information to the Coast Guard

so that they could keep them from going.

If that is what you are referring to, somebody like Alpha 66

of commando I or somebody like that, they were not a part of

the CIA apparatus.

MI. Baron. Although you might be aware of their activities?

MI. Halley. We would be aware of their activities,

certainly:

MI. Baron. Can you explain if there is anything to add

to what we have already said? The chain of command, apart from

yourself as Chief of Station, to Task Force W and to the

Directorate of Plans within the Agency?

You would report directly to William Harvey?

Mr. Halley.

William Harvey was Chief of Task Force W.

later FitzGerald. My chain of command was from me to them.

You know, they had a subordinate staff who helped them monitor

the Station's activity, so that it just was not the fact, you

know, that Mr. Harvey and MI. FitzGerald were totally dependent

on what I told them. To have an appreciation of what was going

on in Miami they had their own staff that was following

• individual operations.

For instance, they had a paramilitary staff that would

review our proposals for a paramilitary operation and i might

say we think that the Station has overextended itself this

month, they want

to run twenty-five operations given the

weather during this particular month of October. We do not

what was the nature of the split of responsi-

bility between Task Forca W and JMWAVE Station?

In other words, were there certain operations that were

run directly out of Task Force W?

Mr. Halley. Also, you have to put this into a historical

time. What period are you talking about?

Mr. Baron. During the period of your tenure. If there

were changes during your tenure at JMWAVE, why do you not

explain those?

Mr. Hallay. There were.

Each

one is different.. Let me

give you a couple of examples.

Washington, Task Force l, essentially did not run

any paramilitary operations

where they took command and control

for

sending people to Cuba. For instance, if Task Force W in

Washington wanted to plant a radio in Cuba which was to be pickod

up by foreign intelligence agents who could report, they would

task us to implant that radio in a cache in a particular area

in Cuba, for instance, Oriente province. We would know simply

that it was a radio perhaps. Wa would then put it into

Oriente province, write up the site, give them the rip cord.

They would communicate to the agents' in Cuba who would go

recover the cache.

So they had agents in Cuba that were raporting foreign

intelligence to them so they had collection assets that were

reporting to them along the same lines that we did. They did

work at a downstream point when FitzGerald came in with a

couple of groups - in other words, they had contact with

Artime. I had no contact with the Artime group as a general

rule. They also had contact with Manolo Ray which I did not

have contact with. So they were working with these kinds of

larger exile groups.

The Task Force also specialized in much more economic

activity than I did. That is a question of looking at such

things as

bus exports from

to cuba. 13,13

Mr. Baron.

In terms of paramilitary operations, if an

assassination operation had been run by Task Force W, would

you have assumed

as Chief of Station In Miami you would have

been aware of guch

an operation?

Mr. llalley. No, I do not assume that.

Mr. Baron. Would it not have been sound managerial

practice to let you know that there was an operation that might

'have been run through Florida into Cuba?

Mr. Halley. No.

You know, the Agency is a highly compartmented mechanism.

You know, let us dispel one thing very promptly here. If you

are asking me was I aware of all these contacts, you know, with

the Mafia -- and I think I can tell you frankly at that time I

was not - Harvey would come, you know, to Miami, to visit me

to review the activitles of the station, and while there would

go off on his own and make his contact with whomever he was

meeting. I knew he was meeting somebody, but it was not up to

me to find out with whom he was meating or why he was meeting

them or what he was doing with them.

Mr. Baron. My question really was, I think more innocent

than that.

Was it strictly one of involving what correct management

techniques would be, or what kind of knowledge the Chief of

Station of JMWAVE would have to have in order to do an effective

job in dealing with the Cuban community and running operations

into Cuba? You seem to be saying that it would not. be ...

necessary to run an effective job to have knowledge of every

other operation that the CIA is running against Castro?

Mr. Halley. I think what I am saying during that particu-

lar time. -- I do not want you to come to the conclusion that

I was knowledgeable of everything that ran in from or through

the state of Florida, because during that period of time, for

• instance, Mr. Harvey in particular was a very compartmented

gentlaman, and it would be keeping with his style to run an

operation in which the locus of the operation might be Florida

and I would not know about it.

Now, that would be an unusual thing, but it is not precluded.

nature of your contacts with William Harvay in raference to any

operations he may have in running unilaterally against Castro.

Do you recall alding Harvey in an operation that he was in charge

of and that was not affiliated..with JMWAVE?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall anything, I do not racall

anything specific. In other words, the pattern was in terms of

command and control, I would come to Washington on a regular

basis to review activity with Harvey after we submitted our

paperwork. Harvey was also a frequent visitor to Florida.

We would have operational discussions. He would talk to the

Branch Chiefs, he talked to people.

He also went out on his

own, and he was meeting somabody, it was clear to me that he

was meeting people. But it was frankly in the way that the

Agency is run and managed, it was not a concern to me whom he

was meeting.

Mr. Baron. Would it have been proper of you to inquire

of him whom he was meeting?

Mr. Halley. No, it would not have been.

Mr. Baron. Did you have suspicions or speculation about

• whom he might have been meeting or for what purpose that he

was having these meetings?

Mr. Halley. No, not for what purpose. There

is a whole,

you know, panoply of things going on at that time. You know,

frankly I was a very busy guy, when Harvey was there, it occupied

one hunk of a lot of my time. If he wantad to go off, you know,

In this business you just do not ask your superior, what

Mr. Halley. To a Cuban exile?

Mr. Baron. Let me strike the reference to a Cuban exile.

Do you recall a time when Harvey asked your aid in procur-

ing arms and equipment to be given to a man named Tony Varona

who was a contact of Harvey's?

Mr. Malley. I know Tony Varona. He was in the period --

prior to the Bay

of Pigs, he was part of the consejo.

Frankly, if you've got something that you can sharpen that

up, I think you need some basis, that. I think that can trigger

my memory here. I do not remember frankly Tony varona being

in Harvey's -

Mr. Baron. In contact with Harvey?

Mr. Halley. You know, I may have procured something for

Harvey, some kind of equipment or done some kind of operational

support task.

about $5,000 worth of arms and equipment to be left in a parking

lot and picked up there by a contact of llarvey's?

And this

would be in approximately April of 1962.

MI. Halley. I do vaguely remember something about a rented

truck. Quite frankly, I do not really recall all the details

of this at this particular time. I do not remember, you know,

personally procuring any material, but it is conceivable that

I did get a request from Harvey, that I did go to the logistics

apparatus, and whatever he had requested from official stocks

he was provided.

MI. Baron. During that same period of time

Mr. Halley. I do recall something about a truck. I do

not recall anything about a trailer. My recollection of this

truck incident seems to be -- I do not remember what it was.

We did do something for him logistically, I do remember a truck

being involved with some logistic material in terms of a

parking lot.

But frankly that is about all I can recall of it

at this particular time.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any recollection of hearing of

poison pills in any connection during your tenure at JMWAVE?

Mr. lialley. No, I do not recall - poison pills?

Poison

pills, the only kind of thing I can recall occasionally when

people were talking about being on mother ships, you know, what

would happen if they were captured. This was a discussion

occasionally of whether any kind of drugs should be issued to

of that kind of a problem. I do recall specific agents who

were sent back to Cuba to run a collection or to go back into

the bush and so forth who asked for some sort of pills which

they could kill themselves with if they were captured.

But other than that if that is what you were referring

to, I think they are called i pills, or something, as they

Mr. Halley. That is what I'm trying to clarify what it is

that you are trying to establish from me.

In other words, if you are saying -

We have a document that. I am about to show you. I just

wanted to clear up. the background of it before we discused

to do with that. If you are talking about, you know --

ammunition, plastics, that kind of thing I could have had

where the thrust of your questioning is.

of poison pills in connection with an assassination operation

against Fidel Castro, and your testimony would be that you had

not, is that correct?

I had wanted something like that, I would have had to corres-

ponded with Washington in order to have had access to it, 1f

observing -

Mr. Baron. For the record, we are discussing the passage

that begins, "When the pills were

given to Varona through

Roselli, Varona requested arms and equipment needed for the

support of his end of the operation. Roselli passed the request

to Harvey. Harvey, with the help of (MI. Halleyl, the chief

of the IMVAVE Station, procured". --.

Continuing.--And then it continues to say a large shopping

list of arms and equipment, which cost about $5,000 and were

supplied in

a parking lot of a drive-in restaurant in a rented

U-Haul truck.

Would the cost of $5,000 have been an unusual expenditure

at that time at JMVAVE Station for arms and equipment?

MI. Halley. No, $5,000 would not have been an unusual

expenditure.

Mr. Halley. No.

Now that I read over this thing, I do recall, as I told

you earlier bafore

you showed me this document something about

a ranted truck and being involved with Harvey in providing him

some logistical support for an activity. I do not recall this

specific list of equipment being involved, you know, soilewhere

you got this and if I could check it against the files, if there

are any files available, I could verify whether this is correct

or not.

MI. Baron. Whether or not the particular list is correct,

you would say that these couple of passages from the IG Report

generally characterize your involvement with llarvey in this

one incident correctly?

Mr. Halley. I would want to sharpen this up, because you

hava one, two, two paragraphs here. In the first paragraph

there is a reference to some pills. I had nothing to do with

any pills. I have no recollection of any pills.

MI. Baron. Let us jump then to the very last statement and

let me ask you if this confirms your own sense of your knowledge.

• The report says: "Harvey says that (Halley]" -- here I

am using your alias. "never knew to whom delivery was made nor

for what purpose. (Halley) was

merely called upon to furnish

support for a headquarters operation from which he was otherwise

excluded."

Does that generally characterize correctly your point of

Involvament with this activity?

Mr. Halley. I would say that is correct.

I want to go back to these other points, though, because

I want to be meticulously correct here. I do not recall the

specifics of this inventory of equipment. I do not recall,

you know, sitting in a parking lot surveilling any kind of a

vehicle. On the other hand, I do recall having been involved

with Harvey in some sort of an effort with a U-Haul truck.

Now therefore that last sentence you have read is correct, ' :

I knew nothing about any of this delivery.and I.:wag called upon

to furnish support for a headquarters operation from which I

was otherwise excluded.

MI. Baron.. You are not denying, are you, that you may have

sat near the parking lot and surveilled

the truck until it was

picked up?

Mr. Halley. I have no recollection -

Mr. Baron. One way or the other?

Mr. Halley. No, I would

say that my sitting in a parked

car with Harvey surveilling a parking lot is the kind of thing

that would have stuck in my mind. I do not recall ever doing

that and that is the thing that has me a little perplexed here

and I am having trouble matching this thing up with my own

mamory. It would have been

damned unusual for Harvey and I to

have sat in a parking lot, and I just do not recall that.

I do have a vague recollection of being involved with him

in

some sort of caper involving a U-Haul truck.

Mr. Baron. At that time, if Harvey had made a request of

you to supply $5,000 worth of equipment like explosives,

detonators, •30 caliber rifles, .45 caliber handguns, radios

and boat radar, would you have supplied that eguipment to Harvey

or to anyone he designated without asking him what the purpose

of the operation was?

Mr. Halley. Yes, I would have supplied it to Harvey or

to his designated representative, depending on how that person

identified himself to me with the equipment that he requested.

That was my chain of command and, if he had told me that he

had wanted this material for any operational activity, I would

have seen to it that it was

issued to him. That is the way the

Agency functions.

Mr. Baron.

Would it have been standard

procedure ina

paramilitary operation to procure equipment that would not have

been traceable to the United States as the If Report indicates

was done in this case?

Mr. Halley. It depends. It depends on what was the

•sponsorship that was trying to be conveyed to the paramilitary

group.

In other words, let us say there was a Venezuelan business.

man who may have been giving some assistance to a Cuban exile

group. If somebody had gotten in touch with that Venezuelan

businessman and he was saying I brought weapons into Florida

of my mind is & Jack Anderson column -

Mr. Baron. And a Drew Pearson column before that.

Mr. Halley. - a couple of years ago in which it was

obvious that this was obtained from a military assignee to the

Agency named Brad something - I cannot think of his name

appeared several years ago. I frankly do not know who the guy

is.

MI. Baron. At any point. In your operational relationship

with William Harvey in connection with Cuban affairs, did you

suspect that an assassination operation was being run out of

Mx. Halley. No.

Mr. Baron. I would like to run down a list of the names

of some people who ware involved in one way or the other with

an assassination operation that was being run out of Task foice

of 1960 involving connactions between CIA officials and people

who have been characterized

as members of the Mafia, of the

gambling Syndicate who had interests in Havana and which involved

the passage of poison pills to people inside Cuba purportedly

for use against Castro in the

restaurant that he frequented.

And this plot by William liarvey's own admission was directed

by Harvey during larvey's tenure as the Chief of Task Force W.

Mr. Halley. I take due note of what you are saying. I

have no knowledge of that. I will be glad to comment-on any

of the names. My commenting on names is in no way to reflect

any knowledge on my part of this particular activity, because

I have no knowledge of it.

Mr. Baron.

You have already stated that you have no

knowledge of any assassination effort involving poison pills?

Mt. Halley. . Yes.

Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear of any assassination schemes

which may or may not have been put into effect involving

exploding sea shells that Castro might pick up by scuba diving?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not recall any exploding sea shells

While Castro was scuba diving, but the problem of Castro being

an avid scuba diver is well-known

to me. As I recall, somewhere

In this thing there was a refugee group or Cuban exile group

or somebody at one time in this whole activity who had focused

on the question of whether Fidel Castro was vulnerable at the

time that he was scuba diving. I have heard that discussed but

MI. Baron. You do not recall ever hearing Desmond

FitzGerald mention that subject or hearing that Desmond

FitzGerald was involved in exploring that possibility, plantina

an exploding sea shell?

MI. Halley. The exploding sea shell is enough of an off-

beat kind of thing that I think I would have recalled it. I

don't recall it.

I do recall Castro's scuba diving, and that representing

a vulnerability and somewhere in the recesses of my memory,

that does strike a bell with me that some exile group, somebody

was talking about Fidel Castro being vulnerable while he was

scuba diving.

Mr. Baron. Did you' ever hear of a plan to present Castro

with a skin-diving suit in which bacteria Injurious to his health

would have been cultured, bacteria that would have produced

tuberculosis and would have produced a dreadful disease?

Mr. Halley. I have never heard of any bacteria approach

to the problem of dealing with Fidel Castro.

I do want to come back to this that I do recall something

about scuba diving, you know, on the range of Fidel being

vulnerable at the time he was scuha diving, but I do not recall

exploding sea shells or bacteria.

Just let me make a note to

(Pause)

Mr. Baron: Do you have any knowledge, acquired directly

or indirectly, of any involvement-of John Roselli in Cuban

operations?

Mr. Halley. Other than reading the papers -

Mr. Baron. Other than what you read recently in the papers

did you acquire any knowledge during your perlod as Chief of

Station at JMWAVE of John Roselli's involvement in Cuban

operations?

Mr. Halley. No. I had the impression

from Harvey going

off that he was meeting with somebody, and at one point in time

I came to the impression that he was meeting a guy by the name

of John. Who John was, I had no idea. We were involved in an

attempt to try to find

at one point who were of

interest. The fellow who provided the lead to that had been

a member of one of the casinos in Cuba at some time.

Mr. Halley. No, I do not. I do not remember the man's

name. It may come to me. You are asking me things. that

happened, you know, in 1962. As I have told you, I have been

in a lot of places.

of this lead, I was surprised with the speed with which we got

a response back on this man and the details run down that we

got on him in terms of who he was and where he worked and so

forth, and I think I concluded at that time that somebody knew

this fallow very well and somewhere in the whole labrynth, eithet

Justice or we or somebody had access to somebody who could give

us a great deal of insight into people who had been involved

with the gambling establishment in Cuba.

Those are the only two things that. I can say to you that

I knew at the time. Obviously I have since read the papers and

I have put together in my own mind by deduction that the John

that I was aware of that. Harvey was in touch with must be John

Roselli, but I cannot provide to you --

Mr. Baron. Would this person with contacts with gambling

interests in Havana have been Santos Trafficante?

Mr. Halley. I would have no way of knowing. I know who

Santos Trafficante is.

Mr. Baron. How do you know this?

Mr. Halley. This is like asking me whether I knew where

• 7th Street is in downtown Miami. Santos Trafficante is a name

that constantly was discussed among Cuban exiles and he was a

well-known figure. You could not possibly be involved." •

Mr. Baron. Did you know of any involvement that he had

in Cuban operations that were connected in any way to the CIA?

recollection when I was in Miami, Santos Trafficante was in the

-

I also think that there was some large scandal, when I was

In Miami, that was played up in the Press. I forget, some

Federal agent who was somehow involved with the Mafia and with

the Syndicate and there was some linkage in the Press between

Santos Trafficante, Cubans and the Federal agent:,. but I do not

remember the details of it.

Mr. Baron. : The Federal agent was not a CIA employee?

Mr. Halley. No, he was not. My recollection is he was

Narcotics or something:

Mr. Baron. You would make the same statement about John

Roselli that you had

no knowledge of his connection with any

CIA sponsored operation against the Cuban government or against

Castro personally?

Mr. Halley. At the time that I was there - you know, I

want to caution you that I have read the Press. If I have

trouble sorting this out, I want you to understand that -

Mr. Baron. I understand that clearly.

MI. Halley. -- that this is a dilemma for me. Obviously

I told you I made my own deduction that John, the one that

Harvey was in touch with, must have turned out in the context of

20/15 hindsight to be John Roselli. At the time, I did not

know that.

and

so forth. The name is familiar to me now.

MI. Baron. The same question for Sam Giancana.

say in answer that at the time that

I was involved in '62 and '65 I did not know anything about

Sam Giancana. I have since read in the Press about him.

Therefore, the name is familiar to me today.

Mr. Baron.

Did you know at that time that Sheffield

Edwards, who was then Director of the Office of Security, was

connected in any way with those efforts against Castro personally

or against the Castro government?

MI. Halley. At that time, Shef Edwards was known to me

as Director of Security. That is all. I had no knowledge of

his involvement in any activity against Fidel Castro in a

personal sense.

Shef Edwards did help Security Officers assigned to my

staff in Miami. Therefore I would periodically go to him about

the performance of his officers who were on my staff. So during

the time that I was involved in Cuban affairs, yes, I did see

him, yes, I did talk to him

about Cuban affairs in Miami, the

performance of his officers on my staff, but nothing about anything

in the office of security under Edwards that they were involved

in the early stages of an

assassination plot against Castro

which was run out of the Office ff Security and later transferred

to the DDP. But you are saying that you had no knowledge of

any such operation at that time?

MI. Halley. I had no knowledge. As I told you before, I

did not even know Jim O'Connell.

Mr. Baron. Do you know a man by the name of Juan Orta?

MI. Halley. That name is familiar to me. It is a name

that has appeared, you know, across my scope. I cannot tell

I would have to go back.

was going on in terms of these various groups and what they

Mr. Baron. Would it surprise you if that were the case?

Mr. Halley. The Tony Varona thing would surprise me,

frankly. I think I would not . I would be surprised, yes.

Mr. Baron. Why is that?

Mr. Halley. Well, because here i8 a case where the guy

was a prominent exile figure,- essentially residing in Miami, and

I knew of no contacts or had no reasons to suspect any contacts

with this kind of an exile figure, though once it specifically

appeared, I was aware of and it was discussed. This was done

under FitzGerald's stewardship with the Task Force. I was .

aware of that. I lould be surprised if someone was in touch

with Tony Varona and I did not know about it. If you told me

that is what happsied, that is what llarvey has testified to,

I accept that. I am

surprised by it.

Mr. Baron. What was the nature of the CIA relationship

to Artime?

Mr. Halley. Well, the Miami Station had no direct relation-

ship with him.. As to the nature of the project, you know Artime

tan from the Agency, from other people who actually worked with

•Him on a first time basis.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of a project called AMLASH?

thing.

out the fact that we are both talking about the same Cuban high

military officer who was known to the CIA by the cryptonym of

AMLASH.

Correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Halley, that you and I agree

that we are referring to the same person that we have identified

off the record?

MI. Hallay. Yes, we have.

Mr. Baron. Were you awar of contacts between AMIASH-1,

as he was known, and Artime?

Mr. Halley. I think at the time that this was going on, I

do not know whether I was or I was not -- I was aware that the

CIA was in touch with AMIASH.

MI. Baron. Did you deal directly with the case officers

who ran AMLASH?

MI. Halley. I did not. My recollection of this AMLASH

case is as follows. • At:some point in time, I had a conversation

with Desmond FitzGerald in Washington during one of my periodic

visits to Washington from Miami. We discussed at that meeting

the nature of our approach to the military establishment in

Cuba. In the contsxt of that conversation, Mr. FitzGerald asked

me if I thought whether it would be a good idea for him to meet

one of these Cuban military personalities, and he subsequently

identified to me the personality he was talking about was

AMLASH-1.

My advice to him was that it would probably not be a good

idea for him to meet him, and the only thing that I could see

coming out of that kind of a contact would be that he, Mr.

FitzGerald, would get a personal feel for what makes some of

these people tick, in human terms, and that that probably was

too high a price to pay for the prospect if anything went wrong,

an individual as prominent in Washington as, both within the

Agency and the social world in Washinaton, would be exposed in

the Press. That would create a flap that I thought was not

worth what would be gained from that meeting.

Mr. Baron.

Would this have been in the fall of 1963?

Mr. Halley. I have no recollaction of the time.

Subseguent to that, Mr. FitzGerald told me that he had

indaed met him and that he had had an interesting conversation

with him. I subsequently recall that this gentleman was met

in Spain at some point in time -

Mr. Baron. This gentleman being AMLASH-1?

Mr. Halley. This gentleman, being AMLASH-1, was met in

I also recall after having left the Cuban activity that

I read a Press article showing that he had been apprehended

and I remember reading the publicity of that particular

activity. It is also my recollection that we put in a cache

for

him.

That is about the sum and substance of it.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall what the purpose of that cache

MI. Baron. At the point that you were having these

in the second instance his reaction to his contact with AMLASH-1

do you recall FitzGerald mentioning to you the fact that

AMLASH had requested assurances that high officials of the u.s.

behalf of the CIA?

Mr. Halley. I do not recall this at the time.

You know, I also want to say, as you probably know from

the record, I was later Chief of the WH Division from 1972 to

1973, and I did read some of the files. I am familiar with

the case. But at the time - I am trying to be schizophrenic.

you know, to put this in the time sequence in which we are

representation to AMLASH-l that Robert Kennedy or othar high

officials of the U.S. government would stand behind him?

of the objectives of the contact with AMLASIl-l was the assassinat

MI. Halley. No. I never had the impression that assassina-

tion was a thrust of the activity. In other words, we were

FitzGerald and his staff were working on what I was doing in

Miami to try to establish contacts with the Cuban military.

In other words, we saw this as a multi-faceted approach. First,

we wanted penetrations of the Cuban military so that we could

collect intelligence. What were their strengths, weaknesses,

what was their mood, where were things going? secondly, wa

wanted from these sources operational intelligence. Who - in

other words, who in these groups were dissatisfied as Fidel

consolidated. Who could provide leadership for a counter-

movement

against

Fidel?

We were looking for people, once we had identified them,

to see if we could establish contacts with any of these leaders

so we could see whether there was a basis for working toward

an overthrow of the Castro government. You know, those were

the basic steps.

NOW

as you got down to talking about how you overthrow

Castro, obviously the question comes in of how does a group who

wants to run a coup or take power take power, and obviously

one of the things that has to be looked at is where does the

•existing leadership going to be during this event, who has ,

control of the various units.

So our discussions were all in

that context.

MI. Baron. Would it have surprised you or would it

surprise you now to learn that at least part of the contact

with AMLASHI would have involved planning for an assassination

Mr. Halley. I certainly was not aware of that at the

time, as I recall from, you know, looking at the files in the

172-'73 period, saeing any evidence of that in the file at the

time.

MI. Baron. There are fourteen folders in the AMLASH file.

Did you read all of those files?

Mt. Halley. No, I did not.

Mr. Baron. How did you gather your impression that that

was in the AMLAS!l files?

Mr. Halley. I think I may have read one or two volumes

of whatever my question was at the time, because these cases

keep

coming up. You know, there must have been some inguiry

at the time that necessitated my looking at the folder or

discussing it with my staff and so on.

Mr. Baron. As far as you knew, what was the objective of

the contact with Artime?

Mr. Malley. You mean the CIA contact with Artime?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

Mr. llalley. As a concept, the artime thing

was looked at

as another track, an approach to the overall Cuban problem to

see if they could sort of do it on their own. If they could

simply be given, you know, & number of dollars, some equipment,

some guidance, and give them an opportunity to find a Cuban

solution to what was a Cuban problem. That was also, you know.

and if you have not, you should talk to the people who ran the

In giving Artime some tutorial training for & couple of weeks

When this operation was first established in order to familiarize

him with some of the problems of trying to manage a large.

operation against Cuba bacause he had been out of things for a

couple of years.

MI. Baron. Were you aware that he had been supplied a

weapon which we already agreed could be characterized as an

assassination weapon?

Mr. llalley. You say "we." You and I?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

Mr. Halley. Which weapon was that?

Mr. Baron. A high-powered rifle with long-range and low

muzzle velocity.

Mr. Halley. I am aware of the fact of this project that

Artime was involved in that he got a number of weapons, any

number of which could have been used for sniper type activities.

I am aware of the fact that he had a base

to

• haveractivities, so I would find it hard to single out a weapon.

My recollection of that that he was given a large number of

weapons.

MI. Baron. Was one of Artime's objectives to have been

to assassinate Fidel Castro?

MI. Halley. Not that. I am aware of.

fashion that would be attributed to the CIA, namely the

assassination of Castro?

Mr. Halley. I think that you have tied two issues together

there and I do not think I can

answer the question that way.

I would like to separate the question into two parts.

Mr. Baron. Go ahead.

Mr. Halley. The first part, as I mentioned to you earlier

the CIA did establish a relationship with Artime and he was

given funds and other support to run his approach to solving

the Cuban problem.

lie was one of two such activities that were

run at the time. And therefore I think that your statement is

correct that perhaps he was set up so that there could be no

direct attribution in his activities

to the United States,

because he set up a base

and the story as I recall

It was put out that he was receiving assistance from the

if you will, for him.

So, yes, there was an attempt to set him up as a parallel

track or a separate track. That does

not follow

from that, in

my perspective, that was geared towards an assassination

operation, because that was a fantastically large operation

This is one of a thousand

I read, you know, hundreds of pages of traffic, so when you ask

Harvey has testified, as has Richard Bissell,

I will represent to you, that instruction was given by Bissell

to Harvey to set up, to develop such a capability in early 1961

and that Harvey took steps to develop such a capability in

coordination with an

asset

in New York named OJWIN

and I think

that period of greatest activity was in 1962 and WIN was

involved in spotting potential assets among the criminal under-

world

and might be used for any number of dirty

deeds.

Mr. diGenova. It should be emphasized that the Executive

Action Plan that you are referring

to has had

its goal the

incapacitation of foreign leaders, one possibility of

Incapacitation being the ultimate weapon, assassination. It

was

just not assassination. It was

a spectrum of activities

that could be used to incapacitate a foreign leader anywhere

from illness, chemical warfare, and then including death.

Correct me if I am wrong, but it was

not just assassination.

Near the beginning of this article, it mentions that JMWAVE

Station operated within an annual budget of well in excess of

$50 million.

Would that be accurate to you?

MI. Halley. I do

not recall whether that is an accurate

figure.

We would have to go back to the records: You know, as

I explained to you earlier, the start of the operation taking

place in March and

with a

mass of figures, and I would not want to give you an inaccurate

answer. That

is something that could be researched -- we have

the files - rather than speculate for youon the buildup and

• reduction in the operation. I do not feel that is useful.

Mr. Baron. As a ballpark figure, would you be able to

place the annual budget of the Station in the neighborhood

of tens of millions of dollars?

MI. Halley. No, I would not, because of this transition,

you know, period, the costs were very high in the beginning to

get a start-up operation, brougit to a certain peak, and then

tapered off and starting to be peeled back. I would not want

to draw a figure of -

Mr. diGenova. What would the start-up cost?

involved or dollars?

right ballpark for your activities at the peak?

MI. Halley. I just have no recollection of the dollar

figure. You might want to get that figure when you can retrieve

It in the files. It is available.

MI. Baron. Were the operations of IMWAVE coordinated with

other Latin American CIA Station's, as the article indicates

Cuban activitles with other Latin American stations were

coordinated with JMWAVE.

want to do it, that would be adjudicated, not by Miami, but by

Washington.

Mr. Baron. Let me quote you a passage here and see if it

comports with our discussions earlier of special arrangements

you may have, the IMVAVE Station may have had, with law enforce-

ment authorities in Florida.

The article says: "All the boat missions to Cuba were tech-

nically illegal under the Neutrality Act, the Maritime Laws,

and Immigtation statutes, so that the Station had to work out

special acrangements with Customs, Immigration and the Coast

Guard."

Is that generally accurate?

Mr. Halley. I think, as I described to you before, there

• was coordination with the Coast Guard in terms of vessel

departures. The other is Immigration?

MI. Baron. Customs, Immigration and Coast Guard.

MI. Halley. Immigration, there would not have been

coordination or a particular, you know, boat dispatch. On the

other hand, let's say if a mission aborted for some reason and

a small boat could not racover its position and get back to the

mother ship to be pickad up and it was adrift or came in to one

of the islands or came in to the Florida coast anywhere and was

picked up and picked up by Immigration inspactors, then they

would

ask to have their case referred to a particular individual

It may have been a code number, a color code, it may have been

we have this group, here is what they say, what is your interest

In this particular group, and then that would be adjudicated

at that point.

Now the third group was Customs. Customs did have a

number of patrols and at times when boat loadings were conducted

off the Florida Keys in particular, those ware coordinated with

the Coast Guard so they would not be expending their manpower

to run down groups that were extricating with us, in fact the

Agency was doing.

MI. Baron. The article continues to say: "It was illegal

for agents to travel around with machine guns and plastic

explosives in the cars, as they often did. The Station had to

establish

liaison with seventeen polica jurisdictions along

the Florida coast

and into the Keys. The result was that

any agant who was arrested for anything from drunken driving to

illegal possession of firearms would be quickly released."

Is that accurate?

Mr. Halley. I commented on that before, and we are on the

record on that as saying that we did not drive around, there

In other words, you are coming back to the same point,

becausy as I explained to you, the weapons were only

given to

them on the vessel and taken back from them when they came back

passage where they

say that the result,

Mr. Baron. Did a situation exist where any agent who was

arrested for anything from drunken driving to illegal possession

of firearms would be quickly released.

Mr. Halley. I have to go back and divide your question

into two parts. There were no

firearms --

MI. Baron. I am not. saying firearms supplied to them by

the CIA for a CIA mission or any agent travelling down the

•street in Miami who happened to have a Saturday Night Special

in his car or who happened to be drunk while driving. Hould

such a person be released right away or once the CIA connection

surfaced?

Mr. Halley. My answer to that is no. In other words, if

he had a Saturday Night Special and was picked up by the police

the case would be looked at at that particular point and if he

had a Saturday Night Special, you know, there would not be any

intervention on his behalf because it had nothing to do with

his

task on the behalf of CIA.

liaison with these jurisdictions.

Had it been set up with

JMWAVE directly through Washington and down through the FBI?

How had that been done?

Mr. Halley. It varied. When we started expanding the

operation, you know, there

had already

been a Station there

and there also were two security units in the greater Miami

area.

In some cases the existing contacts at the Station were

expanded, the same with Dade County. In

other cases, the

security of personnel who had established contact with other

jurisdictions were used to effect the introduction. In some

cases, we had our security

interested In so that there would not be a cross of problems

with these jurisdictions and therefore a liaison was opened on

that basis, a multiplicity of approaches.

Mr. Baron.

The articly discusses the fact that regular

commando raids were run out of JMWAVE Station to the shore of

Cuba, and that those commandos were equipped with all kinds of

explosives and armaments.

Is that generally a fair statement, that we were running on

a regular basis commando raids to Cuba?

Mr. Halley.

Yes.

There were

a series of commando raids

run from the Miami Station against targets in Cuba.

Mt. Baron. Were assassination weapons, that is, high-povered

rifles with low muzzle velocity and telescopic sights, supplied

to those commando teams as a matter of course?

Mr. Halley.. No, they were not. For most of those

commando teams, you were looking for a different kind of a

weapon: You are looking for

a weapon with a high range of fire

power over a short distance to deal with an emergency situation

rather than the kind of, you know, weapon that we are talking

about.

In other words, you would find that type of a group armed

with a submachine gun, as for example.

Mr. Baron. If

an assassination weapon as we have

described it was supplied to a commando team, they would have

to have a sperific purpose in mind for its use?

ship, so there was accountability for the weapons.

Mr. Baron.

would

it have been

unusual to supply what we

have called an assassination weapon to a commando team?

Mr. Halley. Well, that depends on the mission:

For

instance, let me use an example.

Most of the missions that were run were run against targets

•that were in fairly close proximity to the shore. If you are

going to put a party to attack your objectives, let us say the

objective was a petroleum storage tank, if you were going to do

this by putting charges up

against the petroleum storage tank

that meant that you had to have a group infiltrate close

enough to put the charges on the tank. Some distance away

from

them you would give them a second element of the commando

team

which would be providing

covering fire for this group in

case they got into trouble and cannot handle it on the ground.

This covering fire group might have had a light machine gun,

a Belgian weapon. They could have these kinds of weapons and

they did have these kinds of weapons which in the definition you

art

using could be used as a sniper weapon or whatever, but the

basic reason for having that weapon was. to provide

fire support

for the other members uf the commando team. And therefore when

this mission was over and they returned, those weapons were

so that we did not have weapons disuppearing out of our

control.

Mr. Baron. Such weapons, high-powered rifles with telescopic

scopes, conceivably with silencers, were supplied with some

regularity, but they were kept under tight control?

MI. Halley. We had high-powered rifles. I cannot think now

of a case where there was a sniper scope attached to the rifle.

I can think of no case where there

was a silencer attached to

a rifle in any of these commando raids. There were a number of

raids conducted, some of them involved

teams of fifteen or

twenty men. I am not prepared to say that no man ever had one,

MI. Baron. In the Harper's article, it says that Martinez

indicated that "More than once he was given personal charge of

weapons drops in which special rifles with silencers and tele-

scopic sights were left in designated inland

spots."

Do you know of a factual basis. for that statement?

Mr. Halley. Martinez is undoubtedly factually correct when

he says he put caches on the coast

ofCuha

that contained

weapons

I do not know how he would be able to tell what kind of weapons

were in the cache.

The reason I say that is that when one of

these missions were

planned, the cache was put together and

packed by our logistics group and once the cache

was put

togather it was brought on board the vessel and the

cache was

then turned over to the team for infiltration so he would never

have seen the contents of the cache, he would

not have

opened

it up because it was always in a sealed container.

It is conceivable that in the pre-mission briefing that

he got before he went down that he was told that we are

putting

In a cache containing a radio or putting in a cache containing

weapons because that would influence what he selected as a

cache type. In other words, if it were a radio, we would want.

It higher and drier than we would a can containing weapons that.

were wraped in cosmolene and so forth. He might know that they

were weapons, but he wouldn't krow that they were silenced

and they had

a scope.

I must honestly

say to you I doubt that.

Mr. Baron. Did you know of any weapons drops that were

made for the purpose of supplying someone inside Cuba with a

weapon for the assassination of Fidel Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, not for that clearly stated purpose.

As

I told you, we put a lot of weapons caches in. The weapons were

multi-purpose weapons, could be used. I know of no cache that

went in specifically for the task of playing a contributory role

to assassinating Fidel Castro.

MI. Baron. It would not have been contrary to the policy

directives under which you were operating at the time to

supply such a weapon to someone inside Cuba who might have

access to Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, it would not have been.

For instance,

I can remember several resistance.groups that we had that had two or

three hundred

men

that we were supplying on a regular basis.

Mr. diGenova. Inside Cuba?

MI. Halley.

Inside Cuba, that were essentially living in

the bush

to a large extent, whom we did supply weapons to and

got anmunition to them and so forth. And that was why I was

very caraful when you mentioned this linkage before to saying

that I could

not be a guarantor

as to what these men would do

with these weapons once they got their hands on them. They

what you have

said is

a concern of not only yoursalf in terms of

realizing that it was a possibility but of paople like Dean

Rusk and Mi. McCone, who also said, you have to realize then

once

these agents

are in another country and are supplied that

thare is little if anything we can do to control those weapons

after they receive them. It would

be safe to say that that, of

course, was understood that there was a lack of control, and

to the extent that it was a problem, it existed and had to be

tolerated because of the nature of the operation, would that

be correct?

Mr. Halley. I do not know whether I want to phrase it

exactly as you have in terms of this lack of control. Our

mission in dealing with these groups was to first, to put them

in areas where we did not have other intelligence covers. Their

first task was to collect intelligence.

The

second

task was to organize a resistance which would

take armed

action if we ever got a total package put together

that jave us an opportunity - that was the first and secondary

missions. Once we issued the weapons to the team leader, if

you will, he had freedom to recruit from among the peasants

anybody he wanted to. If he gave the peasant a weapon, there

was no guarantee either by the team leader of by us that that

peasant would not do something that we did not want him to do.

To

even shoot a militiaman, you could have an argumant, you

know, over a woman. Any number of things.

Mr. diGenova. Were there any restrictions, once, for

example, those weapons caches were delivered either by land or

air - and we have spoken

to

who was in the lavand

Station, for example, for awhile and

who :

was head of the Havana Station for awhile who indicated that

they were aware of the weapons drops and were intimately

familiar with where they would be.

MI. Halley. That was

all before my time. I have no

knowledge of that. During my time, we made no drops by

air.

Mr. diGenova. Were there any limitations that were

placed of how the weapons would be usad that were delivered into

Cuba to these internal resistance groups?

MI. Halley.

I cannot speak to this period that you are

addressing.

MI. diGenova. During your period.

Mr. Halley. During my period, the weapons ware issued

essentially as self-protection for the people who were living

in the bush. Secondly, to be used in a military operation at

such time as we got the whole package together. Thirdly, they

were to be used for self-protection if they conducted raids,

ambushes, sabotage operations.

with bolt

They were not

sent to shoot pigeons or to kill rabbits. Everyone in the

Underground was

plotting to kill Castro and the CIA was helping

the Underground. I was with the Underground as well as the cIA,

so you can see I was involved in the plots too, but that is

also obvious."

You commented before that there was a lot of talk in the

air about assassinating Castro.

Martinez seems to bg taking

that a faw steps further, saying that there were actual plots

underway in the Cuban Underground to assassinate Castro and

that people who worked with the CIA were aware of those plots

and were

aiding them in effect by the weapons they were

supplying.

Is that an accurate statement?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not think I can go along with that

statement. Martinez' role as

I described it to you, he is

accurate whan he says that weapons were put in and that :'..:

he participated in putting them in. I again question how he

would know what was in each cache. I just do not see that, and

I would have to accupt that

as a sort

of secondhand statement

by him becauser of the way that the caches were put together.

I just do not see his knowing that.

Now I don't want to exclude, however, that any particular

kind of weapon did not go to Cuba. Maybe bolt-action

Mr. diGenova. Could he have found out about this after

the fact from people that he knew in Cuba, members of the

resistance in Cuba that he knew of who would have told him the

nature of the items that they would have received in a cache

delivery? Would that be one way that he could have found out?

was he that intimately involved, to your knowledge?

Mr. Halley. He was not at the time. This is the period

that I am familiar with, '62-'65. I do not know. Maybe some

of these people have come out since then, and

ma; be he has

talked to people who have come out in '68, '69, things like that

I cannot exclude that.

At the time, I do not think, however, he would have had

that kind of firsthand knowledge, and therefore I have trouble

with that statement and I cannot identify with it.

Mr. Baron.

The Harper's article says:

"By the end of

1961, several men affiliated with the CIA had already been

foiled in attempts to kill him" -- meaning Castro -- "among

them, Luis Toroella, executed; Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, still in

•prison; William Morgan, executed; and Antonio Veciana, escaped

to the United States. lad these men succeeded, their efforts

would have been tied to the U.s. only indirectly, if at all."

Let me show you the passage I am reading from and ask

you whether you have any knowledge of the connection of any of

those mer named to the CIA.

Mr. Halley. No, there is no connection that I know of

between these names and CIA. This guy Luis Toroella does not

Iing any bells with me. Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo was a leader of

Alpha 66. He may have been in Cuba in '61. During the time

that I was involved in Cuban affairs he was in exile for - he

was in Miami for a long period of time.

MI. Baron. Can you explain what Alpha 66

is for the

record?

MI. Halley. Alpha 66 was a Cuban exile organization that

was engaged in a number of raids against the Cuban government.

They claimed to have

attacked Cuban shipping, fishing boats, and

claimed to have an organization in Cuba that was a resistance

organization. Gutierrez Menoyo was therefore a well-known name

to me. We had no direct contact with him.

William Morgan is also a well-known name. His activities

and

exploits in Cuba are well-known to anybody that has dealt

with Cuban affairs.

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of a connection

between any of these people and assassination attempts against

Fidel Castro?

Mr. Halley. I have none, no connection between these names

and CIA and attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro.

back up to date. Morgan did get himself in trouble with Fidel

Gutierrez Menoyo. We did have a steady stream of reporting on

the activities of all axile groups and Alph: 66 was high on the

list of groups that had a capability of doing this kind of

thing. Therefore, they received quite a bit of coverage from

us, from the FBI, from Customs, and others.

They were

on everybody's sort of watch list.

MI. Baron. Let us tum now to a document that we will

introduce as Exhibit 4, which is a report by Fidel Castro on

alleged attempts to assassinate him that he connects to the

United States government and especially to the CIA.

(The document referred

to was marked Halley

Mr. Baron. Which was released recently by Gaorge McGovern,

to whom Castro had sent this report.

Mr. Halley, is it true that. I had askod you

to review this

report before we began our session today?

Mr. Halley. Yes, you did, you did ask me to look at tha

report.

MI. Baron. Can you point to any names or incidents in

this report that are connected in any way in your mind to

actual assassination attempts against Cuba: -- Castro?

Mr. llalley. No, I cannot point to any

names that in my

mind are attached to an assassination attempt against Castro:

You asked me to look

at this originally to see if

any of the

names were familiar to me in any way. I made a list of

some

of the names that rang a bell with me, for various reasons.

One name is Humberto Sori Marin. I recall that he was

active, he was active with the DRE.

Mr. Baron. At what page is that?

Mr. Halley. There

is no page numbar.

For

instance, here's

a name, Humberto Sori Marin. That is

familiar to me. I do not know whether that was from the

reporting showing that he was in prison, you know, we constantly

got reporting on, or why, it is a name that I recognize in the

counterrevolutionary sense, that it is something that crossed

my dask, to see the name.

All right.

The other name that is familiar is Tony Varona.

That was a Cuban exile leader. We talked about Tony Varona. I

There

is another name in here, Manolo Ray. I mentioned

Manolo Ray to you. He was one of two exile leaders who had a

relationship with the Agency. You know, I told

you Artime was

one; Manolo Ray is another.

He is familiar to me as a result of

that.

Mr. Baron. You did not know of any involvement of Manolo

Ray in an

assassination effort against Castro?

Mr. Halley.

I do not.

Here is another name mentionad in the same paragraph,

Aureliano

Arango. That is

a name that

is familiar to

me as a prominent Cuban

exile.

Mr. Baron.

You have no more specific recollection?

Mr. Halley. I am trying to be responsive to your question,

telling you which names ring a bell with me as

I run through

this.

Mr. Baron.

All I am trying to do is clarify for the

record the exact nature of your recollection of each of these

names.

Do you have any recollection of a plot alluded to in this

report to shoot Castro with a bazooka at the lavana Stadium?

ir. Halley. No, I do not have any recollection of that.

According to this, it this is correct, it took place in October

February 1962.

Mr. Baron. The same would go for the shooting of a

bazooka towards the Presidential Palace?

Mr. Halley. I have no knowledge:

MI. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of any efforts to

assassinate Fidel Castro run out of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base?

MI. Halley. No, I do not. As you know, fuantanamo had

& number

of Cuban

exiles in it, people who had taken refuge in

the base at one time or another.:. During the time that I was the

Station Chief in Miami we did have contacts with people at

Guantanamo. We did use them for intelligence collection

purposes, but I do not have any linkage between that intelligence

project and assassination.

MI. Baron.

Were paramilitary operations run out of

Guantanano Bay?

Mr. Halley. They were not during my time as Station Chief

in Miami by CIA. There was an office of ONI, Office of

Naval Intelligence representative on Guantanamo. I have no

knowledge of what they may have been doing during various

periods of time. I am talking about CIA.

Mr. Baron. Any other names that struck a chord with you

in this report?

Mr. Halley. Well, you have a name here, Mario Salabarria

Agular; that name rings a bell with me, for what reason, I do

not know. You know, we would have to run a name trace to get

index for me to be able to comment on it. As I told you earlier

I know that the Agency is doing all these traces after they are

completed and you get them and you want me to take a look at

it, I will ba glad to do so.

It may trigger some response.

This name,

it rings a bell with me. It

Is quite possible that he may have been a collection agent, just

as is written here. I am making a deduction, but again, I would

have to look at the name traces, but it is a name that rings a

bell with me.

Mr. Baron.

You do not remember him in connection with an

attempt to poison the Prime Minister in June of 1965 as it says

there?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not.

Then the next name that is on here, that is familiar.

Here is one that we discussed, that is AMLASH-1. We already

went over that one.

The other name was Manuel Artime, whom we have talked

about.

Mr. Baron. Right.

MI. Baron. The last name on here -- I cannot find it -

the other name is Antonio Cuesta Valle. I cannot find it now,

but that is the last name that rang a bell.

Mr. Baron. Was Frank Sturgis connected with the JWAVE

Station?

Mr. Halley. He was not.

Mr. Baron. Not under the name of Frank Fiorino either?

Mr. Halley. No, ha was not. This is again one of these

great myths. At this whole Cuba thing, Frank Sturgis was a

soldier of fortune, was constantly involved on the periphery

of the Cuban exile community. lle was involved in free lance

operations against Cuba. He was somebody that the FBI,

Customs, CIA, everybody, reported on. He was a household name,

but he was not on the CIA payroll during tha period that I was

involved in Cuban affairs, that is the payroll of the Miami

Station. I remember

name traces being run on this guy and so

forth, and the Agency had no contact with him during that

period of time.

Mi. Baron. Are you aware of his evar having been on the

payroll of the CIA?

1x. Halley. I personally am not aware of it, and I think,

you know, if you had gone to the lgency that they must have given

you all sorts of traces on this follow and told you the same

thing.

Mr. Halley. I do not know if your question means the same

thing to me. I would prefer to say we had a liaison relation-

ship with the FBI, that is, on matters dealing with counter-

intelligence matters.

There was a regular exchange of data

with the FBI. There was an

exchange of name tracas on people

that they were conducting investigations on. for: countérintellit

gence purposes, We would trace certain individuals and with the

FBI there were a couple of counterintelligence cases that we

discovered that were turned over to the FAI.

So this is in the context of the normal CIA-FBI liaison

that existed between the two agencies.

Mr. Baron. But the FBI was not involved in supporting

paramilitary commando raids to tha shord of Cuba, is that

correct?

Mr. Halley:

I do not know what you are driving at.

there. I am having a little trouble with that. Are you saying

that the FBI dispatched paramilitary teams to Cuba as

an organization?

Mr. Baron. Wera they involved in paramilitary training

of any of the CIA operatives?

Mr. Halley. No. The FBI did not train any CIA personnel

during my tenure in the Miami Station.

Mr. Baron. Did the FBI at any point provide with you

links to people who had gambling interests inside Cuba?

Mr. Halley. No. Wa covered the gambling thing previously.

Mr. Halley. I read this somewhere in the record in post

years, but I was not aware of this at the time, at the time I

was in Miami.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that serious consideration had

been given to the tactic of assassination at CIA leadquarters

during your period of involvement :with Cuban affairs?

No, that is in the period 1962 to '65. when

Castro.

Mr. Halley. I went through this before before you came

In and explained to Mr. Baron that the subject of assassination

was constantly being discussed in the Cuban community and was a

part of the fabric of the times.

MI. diGenova. That I am aware of. You are not the only

one who has expressed that knowledge that they were all saying

let's kill him, let's get together.

MI. Halley. There was a lot of discussion of this kind of

subject of assassination and that is why I keep trying to be

precise that there was no programmatic operational program that

I was aware of to assasginate Castro.

Mr. Baron. Although the context in which we discussed the

talk that was in the air of assassinating Castro was coffee shops

in Miami and conversation among Cubans as opposed to conversa-

tions among high CIA officials back in Headquarters, were you

aware that there were at least serious discussions of the

use of assassination against Castre at CIA leadquarters?

Mr. llalley. No, I was not. We are plowing the same ground

that we covered before in this.

As I indicated to you, people would come out of, cuba and

discuss these kinds of things.

Some of these were

reported in,

you know, traffic back to Washington. People would discuss

what are the prospects of somebody assigned to assassinate

Castro. In that particular contaxt, yes, discussions on the

assassination of Castro took place. That is why I keep coming

vulnerability because he was a scuba diver. And you asked me

about bacteria, I said I had never heard of an Introduction of

it come up in terms of discus-

sing whether or not a plan should be put together to assassinate

Castro, whether or not an operation should be mounted --

Mr. Halley. I cannot recall any such discussion, but in

any state where there is a leadership dominated by one man, it

'is always a discussion of succession. That question has come

up, you know, if something happened to Fidel Castro, if he is

thrown over, if he does

something foolish himself or if somebody

is

successful in assassinating him, somebody who decides sudden-

Mr. diGenova. Mr. Halley, we have just had a brief

discussion here about some of the things that were covered

before I arrivad by MI. Baron and-you. I do not want to cover

any

more of that ground.

it is my understanding in discussing the structure of

JMWAVE's relationship with Headquarters, General Lansdale's

name came up, and that on one occasion, General Lansdale actually

came down to Miami to visit the station to get firsthand

knowledge of what was transpiring. Is that correct?

MI. Halley. That is correct.

Mr. diGenova. Do you have any idea when that was?

Mr. Halley.

No. I stated earlier it was in 1962. It

probably was in the summer of 1962 because it was

after my

family arrived in Miami. I do not remember the exact dates.

It could be established probably from records of the Agency.

I do not recall it specifically.

Mr. diGenova. To your knowledge, did he travel by himself

or was he with compatriots or

aides?

Mr. Halley. My Iscollection of that. was that he came down

on a special airplane.

There may have been other people on the

plane with him, I do not ircall, hut he

landed at Homestead

Mir Force Base. Ms I recall, we picked him up from there.

some of the assets themselves?

Mr. Halley, Ile had no contact with any Cubans that I am

friends at Homestead Air Force Bage, but I do not recall, I

would have no way of knowing what he did that evening.

In this wide variety of activities carried --

subversive bodies against our country, the --

reiterated plans toward the physical

The proofs we provide, evidence that, since -

using the most varied technical precision ---

It is worth noticing that, in the innumerable

infiltrations organized by the CIA, using ..

rembers of counterrevolutionary organizations,

one of the permanent goals has also been the-

physical climination of Commander in Chief,-

Fidel Castro Fuz.

The CIA, in orden to carry out its plans, has-

used counterrevolutionary individuals inside-

borators, not only those who had been shifted

fron power, but also individuals of different

social origins, including samples of all types

of viciousness.

In the same way, they have had no objection -

to recruting well-known leaders ando members-

from the American naffia, to whom they have -

barred their offences, in exchange for their-

participation in the plots

against our leaders.

Nor have they hesitated in trying to carry --

out their actions in public places, where the

We consider that the analysis of the informa

tions we offer, the publicly known, and the-

that the American authorities possess -

and have not been publisned, allow us to ---

affirm that the physical elimination of Cuban

Revolutionary leaders, specially the Prime -

Minister Fidel Castro Ruz, has been a reiterat

ed policy of the United States through its --

subversive agencies, making use of Cuban ----

counterrevolutionaries, U.S. citizen and all-

kind of corrupted individuals, inside the ---

country as well as abroad, without taking ---

into consideration the victims that would ---

result from these actions.

With this purpose, they have provided the ---

participants with a great number of weapons, -

explosives, technical means of transportation

and communication for the accomplishment of -

their plans.

These are some uf the coonoted and proved ---

facts of the numerous subversive activities -

that the CIA has carried out aimed to the --

assassination of the leaders of the revolutio

nary Government of Cuba.
