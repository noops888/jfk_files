BRUCE was alleged to be driving a 1973 brown Chevrolet leased

on a stolen Texco Credit Card from either Hertz of Sunnysouth

Car Rental Agency •

The following additional information is

set out in the administrative section as it is not regarded

as suitable for the details of this report and is reported

hereafter:

MM 2073-C previously had volunteered information

to the affect that he believed that one JOHN T. SHADWELL

had rented at least one or more automobile, reported the

same stolen to the police, and in fact turned the automobiles

over to JERRY BUCHANAN.

Concerning JOHN T. SHADWELL, MM 1148-C

on May 10, 1973, advised the following:

CI advised JOHN T. SHADWELL was employed by A A

Holiday, Inc. He stated SHADWELL was a former ship captain

and had some connection with Marina I. He stated the man

spoke with an English accent, is about 48 years old,

believed his middle name was TARRING and his date of birth

was about February, 1925. CI stated SHADWELL was employed

at A A Holiday, Inc., a rental car agency at 633 NE 79th

Street. CI stated this business no longer exists.

reported that on of about November 14, 1970, SHADWELL

rented a 1970 Chevrolet Malibu, light green, four-door,

VIN 136390R257908, from Atlas Rent-A-Car, Inc., 160 NW 79th

Street, 757-5508.

At that time, SHADWELL gave his tele-

phone number as 940-1839. CT doubted SHADWELL could be

reached at that number any lunger.

At that time, SHADWELL

was working on "Two J's" yacht.

Renting out the

automobile

he made an $80,00 deposit. Three days later, on November

17, 1970, SHADWELL reported the car was stolen. Atlas Rent-

A-Car was

eventually paid for their loss by All State

Insurance Company. The alleged theft was reported to the

North Miami Beach Police Department. CI stated the North

Miami Beach case file was 8530-C, the All State claim

number was 42B82175.

SHADWELL claimed the car had been stolen at

Marina I. CI stated he saw SHADWELL perhaps one month

ago.

SHADWELL had expressed a desire to rent a second

car

from Atlas Rent-A-Car, however, CI declined the rental

in view of the fact he suspected SHADWELi stole the afore-

said 1970 Chevrolet himself and turned it over to someone else.

He stated he believed SHADWELL had done the same to A A

Holiday, Inc.; however, he stated the records of this corpora-

tion no longer exist and he did not think the deails of that

matter could be found at this time.
