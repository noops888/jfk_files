During JKLANCE's most recent attempt to contact

ANETROPIA-I Via ANIUG-1, It became readily apparent that

the cover story AMNUG-1 utilized with his immediate

superior was unsatisfactory from two points:

First, 1t

did not permit us the operational flexibility so necessary.

this sort and secondly, if AMMUG-l had

not returned when he did, his job security would have been

jeopardized.

arranged

In the luture,

if we again utilize AMMUG-1 to approach a

PBRUMEN official,

we will ask that the MFO arrange to have

one of their representatives from their Headquarters

component contact the appropriate sentor official of

ANMUG-1's company.

This

senior official will in turn

nötify AMMUG-l's immediate superior that ABMUG-1 is to be

permitted to travel

on matters of importance to the

Department of Defense.

Transmitted under separate cover is a copy of

a memorandum we received from the MFO concerning the above

arrangements.

ACTION REQUIRED: None, FYI only.

1.

During the undersigned's most recent meeting with

AMMUG-1,

the agent stated that a Mr. Rex M.

GrIIIID,

an

investigator of

the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service

•(INS) had visited him on 13 April 1971.

According to AMMUG-1,

the purpose of Griffin's visit was to inquire into AMMUG-1's

present welfare and to determine his relationship to

Rodino.

Mr. Rodino is the sponsor of

H.R. #2076 which

will expedite AMMUG-l's application for U.s.

citizenship by

waiving the standard waiting period.) When asked

about his relationship with Mr. Rodino, AMMUG-1 simply explained

that Mr. Rodino was a fliend of his from Washington.

Griffin explained that the reason that he wanted to

talk to AMNUG-1 personally,

was the fact that nearly all of the

information surrounding AMMUG-1 was hold in INS$ office in

Washington. He added that the information that was held by the

Miami office was closely held and access to the files was

severely restricted.

During his visit, Griffin asked AMMUG-1 11

he noticed any unusual interest in his comings and goings, to

which AMMUG-1 replied negatively.

3.

linison with the Miami office

of the INS.

1. AMMUG-1 characterized Me. Griffin's visit as being

very pleasant and commented

that he was

"muy anable".

In sum,
