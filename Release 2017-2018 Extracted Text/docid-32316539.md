LEO ISAAC SAGAL is a notorious bond thief

and counterfeiter and is implicated in other bond

theft cases presently under investigation.

Another major case is the General Motors

Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) counterfeit bond case.

This case occurred in December, 1961, when information

was received by this office from an informant, and

from an anonymous telephone call to GMAC from a

ephone call

this day. This information was to the effect that

some GMAC bonds were being printed. Investigation

disclosed that three to five million dollars worth

of counterfeit GMAC bonds in $1000 denominations,

Series 1980, were being counterfeited for disposal

in South America.

Informant, who worked in a printing

company in Newark, New Jersey, was working late

one night and observed a group of individuals in

the shop working feverishly at a press and from

what informant could see it looked like they were

printing bonds of some type.

Informant had become

suspicious of the characters that had been hanging

around the printing establishment and described some

of them to Agents of this office. One description he

gave fit the description of LEO SAGAL, FBI number

2509323, a notorious bond thief.

Information was

developed that about January 1962, an attempt was

made to dispose of one half million dollars worth

of these counterfeit bonds and LEO SAGAL WaS

involved.

on February 14, 1962, the Newark police

raided

• a gambling joint in Newark and two of the

individuals who were picked up were FRANK NICELI MY
