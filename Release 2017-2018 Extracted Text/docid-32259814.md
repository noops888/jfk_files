Re: Article on Orlando Bosch in New Times by Blake Fleetwood.

6 hr. interview with Bosch.

Traces Bosch's involvement in anti-

Castro terrorism.

Claimed he and Luis Posado (sic) among 6,000 Cuban exiles on CIA

payroll.

Felt betrayed by Kennedy administration and CIA after

Cuban Missile crisis and subsequent USG reduction in anti-Castro

activities.

Went underground after Jose Elias de la Torriente assass. which

he praised but

on which he disclaimed responsibility and began

to direct the "internationalization of the war."

Felt terrorists

should operate from Central and S. Amer. bases, his

goal being to forge alliances with friendly govts. of Nicaragua,

D.R., C.R., Venezuela

Luis Posada

Sec. 6 Serials

Made gov. agreements starting '74, promising no more terrorist

acts in Venezuela if no WCL officials of Cuban regime allowed

in Venez.

Later made contacts in Chile with Right-Wing AA party and con-

spired to kill 2 Cuban diplomats who disappeared 8/9/76 and

haven't been heard of since.

• Carlos Rivero Collade, former Cuban exile, claims Bosch trained

by Chilean National Intelligence Dep.

Bosch refused to take personal credit for bombing within US

because of FBI "heat" but boasted that CORU - coordination

of United Revolutionary organization had been responsible for

over 50 in Miami, NY, Venezuela, Panama, Mex, Argentina

'76 - New Deal - assumed name, lived in Venezuela; could organize

terrorist alts for anywhere except Venezuela, ER, DR.

Thinas going well until Letelier murder: set up by Ricardo Govales

Navarette.

Fleetwood claims Cuban govt. claimed Arile hired Bosch to kill

Letelier and Bosch handed CORU money for assassination. His

group didn't assassinate; wouldn't say who did.

Fleetwood

conf. report. Bosch said at arrest that "Novo brothers were in-

volved."
