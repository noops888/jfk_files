ANNEX B

THE 201 SYSTEM

WOMBITTED

The 201 system prowe

ebrod for identifying a person of specific in-

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234587, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual.

d. Main Inder Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-

erence consolidated

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the

Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915

and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the Ol code AA.

Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other. than AA and those

with no Ol code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigned an Ol code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific

as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one
