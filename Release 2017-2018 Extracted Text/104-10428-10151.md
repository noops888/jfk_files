It 1e obvious they had to liquidate him (OSWALD) so he wouldn't talk.

JARDON agrees and adds that preoisely so that he (OSWALD) wouldn't

talk, the job 1s made more difficult to find out plot of assassination

serious. CARAM says what a ridiculous thing to think that a bar man

premeditated; they let him (OSWALD) be killed. CARAM says did you see

away, alone, or have his wife join him there and then leave for Cuba,

or did he plen to return to the States first and then leave Inter.

Press reported OSWALD entered Mexioo 26 Sept with tourist card given him

by Mexican Consul In New Orleans on 17 Sept.

Press confired that

26 Sept OSWALD crossed border by hit fueto Laredo, Tamps.,

the following

day to Mexi City by road. On 27 Sept he went to Cuban Consulate General

to request visa to transit Cuba because he was golng to tom go to Moscow

via Habana.. Consul Eusebio AZCUE told OSWALD that he would have; to.

consult his government, that the paper work required 10 to 12 days.

OSWALD, because of his irritable charaoter, became annoyed with AZUE

and left the office slamming the door.

On 28 Sept OSWALD went to the

Consul General of the Sov Union to request a visa for Russia. He said

In helping his case, that his wife was a sor citizens that he was a

militant Comminist and had lived three yra 1n Russia.. OSWALD told the

Sov Consul that he could verily this quiokly by calling his wife who was

at that time in New Orleans in a hotel. The Sov Consul said he would

have to consult with his government and that ordinarily a case like this

would take from three to four months. OSWALD again became annoyed as he

had the day before in the Cuban Embassy and left the office very mad.

OSWALD returned to Texas on 3 Oot via the border of Nuevo Laredo, Tamps.

Investigations so far do not indicate that OSWALD interviewed higher

offiolals of the Sov and Cuban Embassies.

no this could not be true because one was a Jew,

that it is definitely

a group of Fascists, very American, he 18 owner of & Cabaret of nudiats

and belongs to political gangsters. Ceoilia says It is absurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering jail where OSWALD was). Julleta says

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with the

police and newspapermen. It wis perfeitly planned, indeed some'of the

police probably are of the same organization because Ruby mattre

Ceollia egrees, the pioture in evidence öf thet because the police

did not move to try to get in or anything for within a question of

seconds there should have been resotion. Julieta hopes they will

continue the Investigations at least Kennedy's brother has sent a special

agent.

Ceoilla says everything about lt is strange r the paper stated

they found this oharaoter (Ruby) drinking Coce Cole on the second floor

and they just left him there. Juliete adds that from the & very first

everything was absurd, that he was & Communist. Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts because the whole thing was so perfectly

planned and that is evident since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy.

Julieta believes that this is 1l done by extreme rightists planned

Trom

very high up and that is why they had to kill OSWALD so he couldn't talk.

Juliete adds that she hopes they will wake up a little with this business

and pay attention to what has happened because it is evident 1t 1s ail a

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men. She adds that in a very

obvious way this Indlyidual (OSWALD) pretended he was a Communist to

prepare the groundwork. Cecilfa belleves that he even purposely married

the Russian girl!: Julieta coments that all was very well prepared,

step by step to blame the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD'S

death everything is more complicated and they couldn't continue (the.

Investigation) and even the Dallas police said that with the death of

OSWALD the case was closed, but the FBI answered immediately that 1t was

not closed, that on the contrary, they had to open an investigation and

aldo the Senate v1l] name a commission to investigate, and Julieta hopes

they won't be alarmed at whatever may be turned up.

She adds that each

time more details i confirm that OSWALD was & Fascist and this business of

trying to join an anti-Castro organization and later poke his nose luto !

the Fair Play for Cube surely all of this was made up by the dallas police.

Likewise she Indicates that all the speeches given try to imply that he

and, if things cons out, that she hopes the publio will be shaken up

so that they will stop this tendency townrd Fascism. Juliete continues

that et the beginning she thought it was caused by racial trouble but

now she thinks it Is something more than thats' it is'a national thing

well planned and that OSWALD as not just aoting spontaneously. Cecllla

agrees; indeed it was a perfect shot with exact caloulation and could not

have been done spontaneously. Julleta says that his (OSWALD's) death

was evidently to shut him up and they had better not say now that Ruby

was at the moment emotional (when he shot OSWALD) because Ruby la the

type who could never be pictured asa great patriot since he has a

crimiral record. Cecilia believes that Johnson (Pres.) and all those

people are paying attention to the strengith in thial Julieta is sure

of this and adds that the news (press was rediculous in respect to

OSWALD In that he went to marry & Russian, later was photographed with the

Dally Worker, with the Communist newspaper in one hand and a Iroskyist

one in the other hand thus everything was very well prepared to blame

the loftists, indeed thid has always been the way they have done it,

commit the terrorist aots and then try to make it appear that the acts

were done by the Communists, that has always been the taotic and only

the people that have no idea about politics can swallow those things.

She adds that this is very dangerous, indeed when they are able to assassinate

a president like kennedy, Imagine how strong they are in the United Stetes.

ECHEVERRIA that he had rearrested Silvia today because he learned she was attempting to

leave Next for Habana. However, Echeverria leter told LEGAT that he had decided to rearrest

silvia to avoid any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable as &

witness. Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI TOT2 - para 97 above)

we have not requested Mext gov to takels any action agrinst Silvia except to maintain

Inoreased surveillarice of her activities. Icheverrie later denied to LEGAT that he lad any

specifio concrete evidence that she was about to leaye for Cuba.

We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurato.

it is quite possible, and even probable, that contra

dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play down importance

of OSWALD visit here Mexi line st1ll is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only interested in finding|

out whether Nasd authorities tried to pay a story from Stivia.

This is obviously Incrorrect

Interpretation. Neither LOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's story. Ple note

that according Echeverrie Silvia is being taken to Attorney Ceneral's office to which

Mexi press has easy access. Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be discounted. 4) We

have as yet found no trace of the red headed Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him. 5)

remarkable colnoidence that both DORTICOS and ALVARADO talk about money paid to OSwALD.

For one thing, pey for an assassin is e factor which immediately rises in the mind of

expert and layman alike. Secondly, DORIICOS may have heard through some Russian or Cuban

source in the Mexi government that DURAN was asked whether the Cubans paid OSWALD for the

alleged assignment. " While we do not insist that ALVARADO's story is beyond all belief

we do urge that Mexi place it and ALVARADO under the most searching scrutiny. His interro-

gators must probe deeply into his make-up and lead him back through the though processes

which may have led him to make this possible mis-step. In securing confessions of

During 1946 or 57 he was employed by a bottling company

than he has stated and apparently for at least three to possibly five months, which contra-

diots information received from Daniel SOLIS, who stated Ylario ROSAS Villanueva was in Cozumel

for about ? weeks in June 63.

ROJAS readily admits that he, ROJAS, is the uncle of SOLIS's

wife. / A verification of his reported travel to the U.S. border, ramely, Nuevo Laredo, has

been established, although not on the specific dates furnished by ROJAS.

CMA records reflect

one Hilario ROJAS was on flt from Guadalajara to Nuevo Laredo on 3 Aug 62. CMA records

further reflect that a telegram dated o1 July: 62 at Nuevo Laredo authorized the CMA ticket

office at Guadalajara to issue a ticket to Hilario ROJAS of 665 Chilarde Street, Gundalajara.

He did not reveal any mental quirks. He tends to be voluble in his conversa-

manner reflecting innate intelligence superior to that of his stated sixth grade education.

He does not volunteer any motive for furnishing info to the U. S. Gov concerning his alleged

association with unidentifled Cubans and with OSWALD,

both at U.s. border and at Cozumel. /

Other than discrepanoies nuttig noted in varlous Interviews conducted with ROJAS, the only

apparently unusual development concerns a reportedly second letter that he has directed to

that he had additional Info to furnish.. According to ROJAS, this additional info concerned

a so-called camera which he saw in Cozumel In the possession of the unidentified Bubans and

OSWALD, which camera reportedly had adaptations which could be utilized to fire about five

cartridges, which cartridges reportedly have a small gas compartment and that said gas was

for the purpose of cutting down on the noise made in firing said camera.

He also described

on Betty MORA to endeavor to find out any additional info which she might have 're OSWALD and

his activities on behalf of the Fair Play For Cuba Committee In New Orleans, La: prior to

the assassination. (See para 264 above). In this connection It will be recalled that MORA

Stated after the death of the President that she hoped that the FBI would not look too hard

in New Orleane because it could be very bad"for us". / Source also reported that Reva BERNSTEIN,

former Chairman of the: FPFCC in Detroit, Mich., has been In Next for more than & month, that

she had been In Puerto Vallerta for & month, that she had wanted to go to Playa Azul but

that she did not do so because "it was not good to do so - so soon after the assassination"

that she was leaving Mexi to go to Zijuatenejo.

Source does not believe she was in Puerto

Vallarta, nor that she is presently In Zijuatenejo. / BERSIEIN also told source that she had

been questioned in Detroit, prior to her departure for Mexi, by the RCMP, but that no inquiry

had been made of her by the FBI or any U.S. police or Investigative agency.

The interroga-

tion had to do with the FPFCC, Its aotivities in the Detroit area, and the fact that she had

reportedly acted as a mall drop for Canadian communists. This Interrogation took place in

a drop, but that she told the RCMP that she had merely acted as the addressee for

Subject: OSWALD. Source produced original of a passenger list.

or manifest relating to departure No. 2, Büs No, 340, 2 Oct 63, of the Transportes Frontera,

S.A. de C. V. bus line, which has its headquarters In Monterrey, N. L. and Its Mexi terninal

at Buenavista Street No. 7. / The passenger list or manifest was clear evidence thet

OSWALD had departed from Mexi on the bus connected therewith which left Mexi at 1:00 p.m.:

and scheduled to have arrived at Nuevo Laredo, Tamps, (across border from Laredo, Texas)

at 5:30 a.m., 3 Oct 63. / Info on passenger list is handwritten, not complete and not all

legible, etc. (report submitted typed list of passengers, seat number, ticket number and

destination, etc.)..."Inquiry at Transportes Frontera Bus Terminal" - On 5 March 64,

Gilberto LOZANO Gulzar advised that he is the Manager of the Mexi Ierminal of Transportes

Frontera Bus Company, Buenavista HT, which has a franchise for "through service" between

Mex1, Monterrey and Laredo, but is not permitted to sell tickets or pick up passengers at.

Intermediate Localities.| / LOZANO said that Transportes Frontera had made a complete study

of its records and procedures and has now arrived at the conclusion that the person designated

as "OSWLD" on the 2-Oct 63 passenger manifest did not purchase a ticket and could not have -

traveled on the trip to which it relates. He pointed out that the list of passenger reserva

tions, tokets sold, and passengers actually boarding the bus in Mexi are recorded on

the

form which is provided for that purpose and is maintained on a clip board on the counter

from which toket

sales pormalllyjare made by the tioket salesman and dispatcher, Francisoo

for tickets. / According to Mr. LOZANO, a reservation is recorded by assignind a seat

numberas avallable and recording opposite the seat number assigned, the name and destination

of the individual requesting the reservations. That reservation is

respected under normal

conditions until two hours before departure time; however,

the event all seats are not

filled, 1t may be held until the actual departure of the bus. Prior to the deperture of

the bus, a final check is made of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that

partioular trip, and at that time the dispatcher conmunicates by radio to the company

headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers on the bus! in relation to the

Monterrey or Laredo destinations for which they purchased tiokets.

!: / Francisco ALVARADO,

tloket salesman and dispatcher for Iransportes Frontera, advised that he prepared most of

the handwriting on the 2 Oct 05 manifest on which the name

"OSWLD" and destination "Lared"

appear opposite Seat No.

4.

He stated that he did not write the "OSWLD" reservation info

and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and the info recorded by the

baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ. ALVARADO Is quite certain at the present time that the

Individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchase a ticket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest.

No ticket number was recorded for that person, and

a search of the company's records In Monterrey had falled to locate a ticket stub which

was not otherwise accounted for In connection with that particular trip. / The notations

by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, I Monterrey" reflected that he had reported by radio to the

Monterrgy office of the company that the bus had departed with nine "paying" passengers

for Laredo and seven "paying" passengers destined for Monterrey.

Listed under "Name of

Passengers" were "OSWLD" with no ticket number, indicating he

did not travel;

"Angel PEREZ"

with no ticket number or destingtion, which confirmed that he had not purchased a ticket

and had not boarded the bus; and "Nicolas GONZAIEZ" Seat No. 10, listed as having traveled

on a pass to Torreon..

/..• ALVARADO and Gilberto LOZANO stated that the notations on.

the back of the manifest referred to advances of funds made by ALVARADO tO LOZANO from the

cash for repairs, parts or other requirements. They related that the passenger lists

are not kept as a permanent record, and, when the manifest was located In the

"trash"

at the request of Investigators of the Mex1 Presidential Staff, the Blanks at the tope

of the form had not been filled In as to time, destination, trip number, bus number, and

date, but they had completed those blanks from their personal knowledge in order to make

that data clear to the Investigators. They also had listed the names of the drivers on the

formax at that tice.

They affirmed that the handwritten

"Transportes Frontera" at the top

of the document had been added by some official of the Mexi Government after the document

was borrowed from them. / Both LOZANO and ALVARADO stated that they had no recollection of

OSWALD,-etc.they could_offer_no explanation as to how Mexican authorities had arrived

at the conclusion that OSWALD bad travelled on the Transportes Frontera bus of 2 Oct 63,

but pointed out that after the name was located on the manifest, they had not been given

an opportunity of reviewing, analyzing or checking out the data thereon. / Lucio LOPEZ

Medina, baggage and freight handler at Transportes, related that he often assists the

Sebastian PEREZ Hernandez,

after PEREZ Hernandez had completed his working day and left the hotel. OSWALD was alone

and usually wore & knit, short-sleeved sport shirt and no coat or jaoket. He did not remember

seeing OSWALD depert the hotel on the moming of 2 Oct, but t it was possible that the

night watchman, who remains at the reception desk during the night might have been aware of

OSWALD's departure from the hotel. Watchman is Pedro RODRIGUEZ who dould be located at| the

MEMO FOR FITES from COS:

On 18 Sept 64 I saw LITEMPO/4 who advised that a.

at time she was questioned about OSWALD denied that she or her husband was a member of the

Conle Party, the PPS or any other Connie or Marxist organization.

questioned at the same time, gave the same replies.. b.

Silvia and husband admitted they

believed 1n Marxism, tried to live so as to "conform to Marxist/leninist theories!.

said "I am a Marxist".... c. Silvia has disappeared from her home: Horecio claims he does not

know where she is. He continues to live at Av Constituyentes 143-3 and is able to pay rent,

lights, etc. / LITeMPO/4 said he could be quoted as saying that "no Mexi except Communists

had worked for the Cub Emp in Mexi since Jan 59".

Insists OSWALD is Collaborator in Red Network - by Robert iS. Allen and

paul Scotti

i. Documents delivered to the archives where the papers will be avallable -

If they do not disappear

to researchers, future Investigators and students of history.

.... Pillion traced OSWALD'e activities ir

the Sov Union, his close association with the

KGB, his marriage to the niece of & It. Colonel of the Soviet MVD, and his later visits to

Mexi, reporting:

".....Upon arrivel in Sov Union, OSWALD voluntarily became associated

with the Sov Secret Police (KGB),

whihe is responsible for recruiting and training

of agents for sabotage, assassination, Incitement of riots and other forms of terror..

KGB arranged press conferences to publicize OSWALD's defection, then provided a job for him

In the sheet metal shop of a radio factory in Mirisk. OSWALD was not a skilled sheet ital

worker

This was a sham cover. Job: OSWAID was

given a 5.000 ruble lump sum payment prior to going to Minsk.

Thereafter, he received 700

- rubles per-month as wagestand an additional- 700 rubles per month from the KGB.

The 700

ruble payment from the KGB was falsely represented as emanating frim the Sov Red Cross.

The 1,400 ruble monthly Incone of OSWALD was compatable to salary of Gen mgr of the factory

where he worked.

KGB provided OSWALD with a scarce

and comparatively luxurious apartment

In Minsk for a period of more than two years..

for extended period. I-l noted that activity inside LIMERICK compound could be seen from

(Il notes that Sovs aware bldg had no garage prior to G Inspection tour.)

/ Sta belleves above is concrete Indication Sovs looking for likely KUBARK photo base sites.

LILYRIC 1s one of eight or nine apts which could give sane coverage a LILYRIC. No possible

anticipate what Sor next step will be nor timing. Request Hgs comments on security

surrounding report annexes priro to their release and possibility Sovs have already obtained

copies. / .....

MEMO FOR THE RECORD from Flannery (C/CA) ›Elena GARRO told Bunice Odio (who relayed to

TICHBORN on 9 Oot) that she and her duaghter were invited to a party at the Cuban Emb during

the period she now finds out that OSWALD was here in Mexi prior to the assassination. She

was invited by a Mexi secretary in the Cub Emb whose husband is a cousin of the GARRO

family (Horacio DURANI???). At the party, she saw three Gringos, not drihking, not mixing,

and more or less just standing around together l1ke "three bumps lon a 1og"!

They were so

obviously out of place, she asked someone In the Cub Imb about them and was told that "they

were just passing ain through". I She claime that on account of the way these three gringos

stood out she took a good long look at them as did ber daughter. When assassination occurred

and OSWALD's picture was spread into the newspapers, both Elena and her daughter immediately

said that he was one of the three gringos "without & doubt"

Note covering above memo to COS:

Do you want me to send the gist of this to Has? COS wrote!

Yes, but we should follow up first. Flannery then wrote! Nothing further.

DIR 56876 (Refs MEXI 1191 - para 397 above) Igs has no evidence that Sove have advance copy

of photo.

Comm sources assure us its copy of photo furnished by the FBI has also been

altered to black out the background.

At present the annex is scheduled for release around

mid Nov. / Considered opinion here is that Sov action per ref would seem to be a logical CI

step as-a precautionary measure on basis of published comn report. That a thorough

security surver should be done at this time either on Sov Emb's own Initiative or on request

from Moscow is not at all surprising. Independently of any specifice contained in Coum repor..

(attachment is para 409 below)

MEMO TO FBI from WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll Info he

allegedly received from & well known Cuban soientist and acquaintance on 23 Nov 63, but which

he had forgotten to report. The release of the Warren Comn Report reminded him of the Inci-

dent. / The solentist said he had been at the Havaha alrport on afternoon of 22 Nov 63 when

at 1700 hrs an afrcraft with Moti markings landed and parked at far side of the field.

Iwo men, whom he recognized as Cuban g "gangsters" alighted, entered rear entrance of

administration bldg and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures. Eis

curlosity was aroused, and he was able to leatn that the aircraft had Just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, Via TIjuana and Mexi City. The plane had been forbed to land at| TIjuana due

to engine trouble.

By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved In assassination. !

He speculated that OSWALD had acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

In Dallas to organize or oversee the operation.

He told the source that he had been greatly

distressed by what he had seen and heard and had to telll someone about it.

He then cautioned

source not to tell anyone else about it or they would hum both be shot by the Cubans. /

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION, /10 Dec 65) between Elena GARRO de Paz and Charles Thomas, Political

Officer tea pee Flena leased her alleged encounter with OSWALD.

Also,, present were

Thomas wife, and Elena's daughter, Elenita. Further info was given subsequently on 9, Jan 66.

During this latter conversation, Elena admitted she had gone to Amenb on an earlier occasion

with her daughter and mother-in-law and talked to two Emb officers (presumably from LEGAT) about

this matter®

She said since the Emb officers did not give much credence to anything they said,

they did not bother to give a very complete story. The following info supplemente and in

some instances corrects that given in the memo of Das 10. / 1.!

Ivilla, Horacio, and Ruben

DURAN are all cousins of Flene. Splvia 1s married to Horaclo, a weak man, who was converted

to Communism by Ricardo GUERRA. Eiena has nothing to do with Silvia whom she detests and

considers a whore.

Ruben was born in U.s. and served In U.S, army during war.

...Party was

held at home of Ruben.: / Elena believesidate of party was 2 or 3 Sept 63. few days befor

vialt of Sor astronaut, Gagers, out is, not sure of date.../ At the party OswAnD wore a black

sweater. He tended to be silent and stared at the floor.

Two young American companions,

one was very tall and siender and had long blond hair utt which hung across forehead, gaunt

face and long protruding chin; other was tall, short light brown hair...All three were

obviously Americans and did not miz or dance with other people,

The three were friends,

because Elena saw them by chance the next day walking down the street together. A Although

Elena had returned from Europe in June or July, she had already met Eusebio AZCUE and knows

were in heated laiscussion on that

occasion about Kennedy and they came to conclusion that the only

solution was to kill him.

Elena said CARBALIIDO is known as & Castro agent, he had been to Red China, Sov Union, and

In N.Y, and who is now a f professor at Rutgers. The day after assassination, Elenita

encountered Sra, de ACUR do Janbois. On wedne hex, ard, del Azul hurried out of store.

Veno of conversation - Subject: Further on OSWALD and K Assassination - (Ref:

this Subj of 25 leo 65 - pera 427 above) Participants - Elena and Thomas (Pol Officer) -

Elena described some developments which may have some bearing on her claim that she saw

OSWALD at a party at home of her cousin

Ruben DURAN when OSWALD was in Mexico prior to

Bassination. / Elena said Carlos SOLORZANO 1s well acquainted with Cub Amb HERNANDEZ,

irmas, and that he wes not leftist but his brother, Alfonso, was a Communist. Amb HE RANDEZ

told SOLORAANO he wanted to meet Elena, so SOLORZANO arranged a party at his own home on

30 June 66 and invited both of them.

Also present were Tito MONTEROSO and his wife;

Elvira VARGAS, leftist Journalist with NOVEDADES and personal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;

Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin DIAZ Canedo, head of publishing firm

called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORIANO, painter, who was invited to make her feel at

ease, since he is a friend of hers and was the only anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening,

Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she described as intelligent and cultured, cucen-

trated his attention on her..... and expressed Interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.

He Issued a personal invitation to her to attend the annual literary festival of the Casa

de las Americas in Havana: She said she was not & Fideliste and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb HERNANDEZ then Invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro regime over the objections of the others present...../ Later, her friend,

Victor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned ber not to go to Cuba alone.

/ On 4 July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre In

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and some printed matter from the Casa

de las Americas In Havana.

The first letter, written last Ootober. (66?) gave her address

as Vermont 38 and the secand letter,

written in April, gave her address as Vermont 39.

The envelope for the first letter, with the above address, was marked for return to the

sender, which was the Cub Emb here.:

The second envelope, which contained the whole pkg.

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments. / Elena stated the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was because she spent several

days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination.

The correct address of the hotel is

Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor

error, as her regular address. / Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensibly to

protect her from the Communists, this raised the question of how the Cubans obtained that

Two

other friends of these three who might have learned of it are Eunice ODIO and June COBB.

She has always been suspiolous.of all three because they went out of their way to

cultivate her when she returned from Europe In 63 and made such a point of being outspoken

•: Elemna said CALVILLO was & close personal friend of Noe

PALOMARES and Pres, DIAZ, Ordaz, and that guards, presumably from Gobernacion, had been

placed outside her home when she returned from the Hotel Vernonth....../ Elena thought 1t

possible that the lub Emb had deliberately given her the letters from the Caa de las

Amoricas with the Vermont Street address in order to frighten her.

She was already con-

cerned about what appeared to be three gunshots that had been fired through her upstairs
