Synopsis: Miami is requested to forward the documents listed

below to the JFK Task Force as soon as possible due to an

extremely short deadline.

Enclosure: Copy of pages from requested serials.

Details: Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA)

any material considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

form. The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened

in

full. Therefore, the serial will not be returned to Miami.

Since the originals will be sent to the NARA, copies of

the serials should be made for record purposes prior to shipment

to FBIHQ.

The serials should be received at FBIHQ no later than

c.0.B. 06/11/98.

Please ship the following serials to FBIHQ, JFK Task

Force, Attention

Catherine L. Lamey, Room 11144.

(JFK Task Force is in possession of Section 4

of Miami File

,92-503 Sub I. The original of serial 329

is missing

from the file. Miami should attempt to locate this serial and

advise FBIHQ of the results of that attempt. A copy of serial 329

is attached.)
