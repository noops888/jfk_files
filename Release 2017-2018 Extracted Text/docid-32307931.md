in that position.

A vote on this point is supposed to be

taken soon.

ZICARELLI hopes that the vote will go against

him as he wants out of this position. According to this source,

ZICARELLI is not cut out for a position of big leadership and he

cannot stand the pressure.

Again on December 7, 1966, source advised that vote

for ZICARELLI's promotion is scheduled for the near future and

the New York feople are putting a lot of pressure to bring the

matter to a head.

This source also advised on February 1, 1967, that

he had recently talked with RALPH DE MEGLIO, strong-arm man

for LON figure JOSEPH ZICARELLI.

From this

conversation, he

learned that ZICARELLI and DE MEGLIO drove to a spot in New York

City where they were met by eight individuals, four in each of

two automobiles. ZICARELLI was put in the back seat of one car

between two men and DE MEGLIO in the back seat of the other car.

later arrived at the same place. DE MEGLIO confided that he

thought that both he and ZICARELLI were going to be "hit."

ZICARELLI and DE MEGLIO had been taken to the residence

of LCN bOss JOSEPH BONANNO.

BONANNO had called in ZICARELLI and

DE MEGLIO just went along for the ride. From what DE MEGLIO

said, BONANNO is trying desperately to regain his former position

as boss of the LCN family of JOSEPH BONANNO.

This position is

currently held by GASPARE DE GREGORIO.

Informant said that from

what ZICARELLI apparently told DE MEGLIO after the meeting,

BONANNO wants ZICARELLI in the same position (underboss) that he

holds for DE GREGORIO 1I BONANNO is able to regain his control.

ZICARELLI, according to DE MEGLIO, is "scared to

death" because he feels that he is in the middle of this power

struggle between BONANNO and DE GREGORIO and that he, ZICARELLI,

could very easily wind up dead. BONANNO is seeking ZICARELLI's

support in his bid to regain control of his old IN family.

On February 28, 1967, NK T-4 advised that during the

week of February 20, 1967, JOSEPH ZICARELLI met with "BILLY"

BONANNO, son of JOSEPH BONANNO, LCN boss, at the Walk Inn

Restaurant, Cliffside Park, New Jersey, which is owned by ERNEST

"TUBBY" DAVINO. BONANNO was accompanied by two of his strong-arm

JOSE: BORATO Jersey, a DiC

men, VITO and TONY.

ZICARELLI was accompanied by his strong-arm

man, RALPH DE MEGLIO.

At the conclusion of this meeting,

ZICARELLI was "shaky."

while he, informant, waited hearby at Charlie's Tavern, which

is located on prince Street near La Fayette Street, New York

city.

This tavern is owned by DANZO's brother and

is used as

a meeting place for the hoodlums.

On the same date, informant advised that DANZO,

after conferring with FRANK SALERNO, discussed the following:

He said that the "real leaders" in "the Organization"

are the "old Mustangs" who are almost never seen and most of

whon do not even speak English. He said that the ones who are

arrested and make the papers are powerful themselves, but that

the "Mustangs" give them their orders.

DANZO said that the PROFACI family of LCN (now known

as the JOSEPH COLOMBO family) is by far the most powerful of ICN.

This family controls the underworld activities in Chicago,

Illinois, Las Vegas, Nevada, New Orleans, Louisiana, all of

california and Puerto Rico, and the alleged LCN family bosses

of those areas, such as CARLOS MARCELLO and SANTO TRAFICANTE,

actually answer to COLOMBO and pay "dues" to that family.

According to DANZO, New Jersey family boss SAMUEL DE CAVALCANTE

1s also "under" COLOMBO..

JR.

DANZO's daughter recently married SALVATORE PROFACI,

According to DANZO, this is the first time that any

"connected" guy was ever allowed to marry outside the "family."

He said that PROFACI, „JR. is being groomed to become a big boss

in "the Organization.

On October 20, 1966, NK T-4 advised that THOMAS EBOLI

is not running the VITO GENOVESE family of LN while GENOVESE

is in jail. The real power in the family is 74 year old MIKE

MIRANDA.

On October 27, 1966, NK T-4 advised that the position

of boss of the present DE CAVALCANTE family was first offered

to ANTONIO ROCCO CAPONIGRO upon the death of DELMORE.

CAPONIGRO, whom source described as a Caporegime in

ANGELO BRUNO's Philadelphia ICN family, turned the position down.

According to this source, everything in South Jersey,

including DE CAVALCANTE's family,

is under ANGELO BRUNO.

This source also advised on January 11, 1967, that

"all the guys working under Caponigro" fight one

another for the

top jobs because CAPONIGRO "treats" these men so good.

NK 92-1203

On November 1, 1966, NK T-8 advised that he had

"Paul The Greaser," of Bridgeport, that AGRESTA and ZICARELI

are in the same "family" and that

although AGRESTA was higher

1n rank than ZICARELLI, ZICARELLI was well respected,

On November 30, 1966, NK T-8 advised that JOE

ZICARELLI stated that JOE ADONIS' SOn

(JOSEPH MICHAEL DOTO)

is being grooned for an important position in the LCN.

On January 4, 1967, NK T-3 advised that even though

DE CAVALCANTE has his own New Jersey LCN family, he still answers

to the "big boys" in Brooklyn.

On January 11, 1967, NK T-4 advised that he was

recently in the company of several members of the LCN family

O1 JOSEPH BONANNO and from their conversation, it was apparent

that they are unhappy with JOE BONANNO as a boss.

Source got

the impression that BONANNO was due for a "hit" although this

was not openly discussed.

SALVATORE PROFACI,

JR., son of the late New York City

LEN family boss JOSEPH PROFACI,

is married to the daughter of

JOSEPH "WHITEY" DANZO, who is closely associated with

SAMUEL.

DE CAVALCANTE®

NK T-3 on January 19, 1967, advised that DANZO claims

that SALVATORE PROFACI, JR. 1s

being groomed for the purpose of

some day having a big responsibility in the affairs of LN.

He said that MAJURI

brewing in SAMUEL DE CAVALCANTE'S family. Source said that SAM

is hogging everything and is not cutting up the action just like

"BIG PHIL" AMARI did years ago.

Informant said that there is

discontentment among the people working for SAM and that trouble

has to come.

DE CAVALCANTE does not trust MAJURI because MAJURI has

a tendency to take money that does not belong to him and run.

He said that MAJURI has done this in the past but because of his

closeness to DE CAVALCANTE, has gotten away with it.

Informant

said that DE CAVALCANTE goes regularly to MAJURI's home for

dinner and that everytime he, informant, is there, DE CAVALCANTE

shows up.

RULES OF CONDUCT

On July 8, 1966, NX T-23 advised that a man becones

a leader in "the organization" because he is successful and

has a number of people whom he directs and who look to him

as their authority and protection.

Informant said when the

above is true and the individual has a territory or sphere

of influence, he is known as a "don".

The persons under the

"don" must come to him to settle their problems or get his

permission before going to another "don" to settle a matter.

Informant explained that RAY DE CARLO is his "don";

could he go to any other "don". Informant said that 1f

of RAY's men were to persist in an effort to break the rule,

then it would be necessary for RAY to have him killed, not-

withstanding that he be his closest friend or even his brother.

Informant said he has seen instances in the past

where a man would be in the "barn" complaining to RAY about

something and RAY would not even listen to him, but would

curse him out in a loud voice and tell him to get out.

RAY

would probably say something to the effect, "why haven't you

gone to TONY BANANNAS or the 'Boot??", as the case may be.

Informant said there are not many killings today

when compared with those of years ago.

He said, "There are

many unmarked graves in Bergen County." Informant said

that in the days (1-2 years ago) when he spent a lot of

timesat the "barn" (DE CARLO's headquarters) there were a

number of young "punks" who came there when

they could

seek to curry favor with dE CARLO.

It was apparent to

informant that the younger element was seeking

• to please

DE CARLO.

Sometimes RAY would give such a person a summer

job or something in particular RAY wanted

done, in order to see

how well this individual would do it.

In almost all cases,

the

individual would make

aneffort to do even more than RAY might

request, particularly 1f lt were a question of putting on a

little pressure or making a collection.

On other occasions, RAY might forget a man and

wait as much as a year of more and then, seemingly out of

the blue sky, would say to informant or

another associate,

NK 92-1203

"What happened to that guy from (name of town) who came with

(name of person)"; and RAY would say,

"Go out and get that

guy and bring him here tonight."

Informant would then have

to find this man and have hin in RAY's headquarters that night.

At this point, BAY would probably give him a

job or some

responsibility over a period of time and observe how well

his

duties were carried out.

If RAY was satisfied, he would likely

tell one of his associates,

"Put him on

the payroll for $300

a week", and it would be done.

On February 23, 1967, NK T-3 advised that DUTCH MELE,

a tavern owner in the Middlesex County area, had borrowed

$2,000 81153 money from ANTONIO CAPONIGRO and had become

delinquent in his payments.

CAPONIGRO had demanded a $5,500 lump

sum payment or $350 a week from MELE.

MELE was unable to

meet either payment and the word was out that CAPONIGRO had

ordered a hit for MELE. It was then that SAMUEL DE CAVALCANTE

had a sit-down at his office In Kentlworth, N Jerres, instructed

result of which the hit order was removed and MELE was

to pay CAPONIGRO $100 a week for some

Indefinite period.

APONTERO, MBLE ADA PETE MANTELLA, E CAPONICRO MAN.

from Passaic, New Jersey, had gotten out of line. This

nephew of CAPONIGRO went to the site of the monte game operated

by CLAUDE HAMMOND and FRANK MALLAMACI in West New York,

New Jersey, and roughed up a couple of young guys who owed

the nephew of CAPONIGRO some shylock money.

said that MALIANACI protested this action to ANGELO BRUNO,

Caporegime of ANTONIO CAPONIGRO. CAPONIGRO reprimanded his

nephew, who claimed to be drunk when he ordered this action

and CAPONIGRO later went to MALLAMACI to apologize for

the trouble.

On Hay 9, 1967, NK T-35 stated that WHITEY DANZO

had attempted to move in on FAT LOUIE LARASSO's territory,

in or near Elizabeth, New Jersey, in the same manner:

As a result, LARASSO personally gave DANZO a physical beating

for his attempt and deterred DANZO from encroaching on his

action.

The informant stated_that DANZO did not complain to

anyone

and as a matter of fact, attempted to conceal it from

even his closest associates.
