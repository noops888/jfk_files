ERNEST DE VITO, mentioned herein, is subject of

New York files 92-2604 and 126-1054; Baltimore files 92-700

and 166-385; and Bureau files 92-7232 and 166-1554.

ANTONIO RIPEPI, mentioned herein, is the subject of

Pittsburgh file 92-223.

Nich respect to BENJAMIN MAGLIANO, better known as

BENNY TROTTA, Baltimore is currently contacting him as a Tor

Echelon informant target.

His activities have been very

closely followed during the past seven years, including a

three-year period when coverage was afforded

by a highly

confidential source.

At no time was there any indication of

actual membership in or cooperation with La Cosa Nostra on

the part of MAGLIANO.

He has admitted being friendly with

FRANKIE CARBO, a New

York hoodlum who has excercised

considerable control in the boxing world and since MAGLIANO

was interested in scheduling boxing bouts for HOLLY MIMS, a

boxer owned and managed by MAGLIANO, he, MAGLIANO, had to

maintain a friendly relationship with CARBo.

Although it is

possible that MAGLIANO could have been a member of the La

Cosa Nostra without such membership being apparent, it is

felt that the factors indicating the contrary out-weigh those

indicating

the possibility.

Efforts have been unsuccessful to develop, as Top

Echelon informants, a La Cosa Nostra member; however, under

development at the present time as a Top Echelon informant

target is

Other individuals who,

although not suspected members of La Cosa Nostra but who

are

of Italian extractionaand acquainted with suspected members,

are being contacted in an effort to cultivate and develop

them into productive informants regarding La Cosa Nostra.

Suspected members, MARIO ORAZIO ANELLO, FRANK MALVASO, FRANK

CORBI, were all interviewed as subjects to appraise their

, possibility as Top Echelon targets.

The listed members and suspected members of La Cosa

Nostra in the Baltimore Division, only FRANK CORBI and JOSEPH

GIGLIOTTI, have given any indication of being engaged ir

illegal activities during the past seven years.

CORONA,

MORICI and ANELLO are in poor physical health and their

movements are restricted by their afflictions and old age.
