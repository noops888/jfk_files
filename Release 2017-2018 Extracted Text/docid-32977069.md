At Cen Lanadale's request, Mr. Harvey opened the meeting by

giving & general operational atatus report. He discussed teams,

oto., in Bose deta11, Indicating thatthe aision of the teams

was Intelligence collection, controle and the development of

latent resistant areas. The quality of the Ope Locla Interrogation

Center - reporte have been good. 150 are coning in per week on

an average of possible intelligence reporte. Very little of high

level political intelligence has been available. However, treneD-.

dous ansunts of counter-intelligence is being received. Inforae-

Sion en 300 Olen agents per week, for example. Nothing so rar

uncovered la the intelligance area ahanges the basio conclusions

made originally My Oth, a la dethat of this task. However,

for the nost part, conolaalens hate bad fireed by farther informa-

tion. Generally aabotage is decreasing ia Cahi. em

sperational

problems of putting in agents are getting rongher ail tougher.

The controls by the Comunists in Cuba are getting lighter and

tighter and will slow dom the operation. Agents must have

dooments, to get documents you must regiater, when you register

the Bles informer cheoks on you periodically. This makes 1t

tough to get ration cards. Some few Cuban agents have been coming

in through the Opaloaka Center. Mr. Kennedy asked hon abut the

backlog of refugees - some 75,000 people coming in through Ope

Locka in the Miami area prior to beginning of this operations

intelligence center there. How about a program to assure that

these 75,000 sources are exploited. Mr. Harvey indicated CIA

had a plan to get this done, to date they have been unable to hit

a big part of the backlog, but in certain special cases have been

getting information from them, that they have a plan for this

and will handle it when they get the personnel available.

Mr. Kennedy brought up the possibility of using Immigretion

Department people, especially the broader patrol types who can

speak Spanish. Mr. 0ilpetrio indieated that Senator Bart's

Committee has recommeniled an additional screening center for

Cubans, possibly in the New Orleans area.

Mr. Kennedy asked CIA what the vote would be in Cuba an

between the Castro and the anti-Castro.

Gen Craig was asked to report on DOD partieipation. He

eirst discussed CIA support: in general, that during the first

phase of the operation, DOD's primary role would be to support

State-CIA and US. in the intelligence gathering phase and in

the interin period to be prepared at a moment's notice to inter-

vene in Cuba to prevent & Hungarian type operatien or 8o exploit

assistance from the OAS nation.

Third - If the operation is conducted as quickly as

possible and with suffiolent force so that the Comunist bloc

ability to take effective counter-measures was reduced to a

minimum.

It was then emphasized strongly by len Craig that the

JCS were very apprehensive in regard that the Soviets were

capable of taking a page fron our book and estabilsh an overseas

military base or bases in Cuba. It would greatly inorease our

national vulnerability and our defense cost al forces would

have to be developed or shifted to meet this threat from the

South, that the Soviets had an option on which they could

foreclose at any time in this regard. They can make decision

to establish a ullitary base in Cuba as their will and pleasure

Cuba. It 18 equally important fron lentilles piasting purpose:

that we have an early decision as to whether ve lafinitely intend

to use military force if the sovert means fail. It was emphasised

that in the event the Soviets foreclose the option and establish

bases in Cuba or accept Cuba as the legitimate member of the Warsar

Paot that either one of these aets would place new dimensions and

new facts bearing on the problem and introduced confideretions

which would postpone positive action indefintely if not preclude

for the foreseeable future the elimination of the Communist regina,

since to remove the base might well trigger World War III.

Mr. Goodwin indicated to the group that the views I expressed

in regard to the conditions under which we could go in xithout

causing too much world consteration and condemnation, and to

the options hold hy the Sortet Russia conserning bases in Cuba,

both represented paitical judgnents and were without defense 's

a political Judgment. I indiested that this was a political-

military judgaent, there was no doubt about it but that 1t

certainly did involve the Defense and JCS responsibilities,

inasmuch as NSAM No. 55 published last June, the President had

inforned the Jeint Chiefs of Staff that he considered them to

be wore than ailitary sen and should advise him on such mattere,

when it involved the security of the United States, that the

J01nt Chiefs of Staff felt obligated to so advise the President.

When I made this statement Mr. Kennedy Indieated to the effeat

that this vas sorreat, that it was the responsibllity of the JeS

to make recommendations of this nature.

Mr. Goodwin did not pursue the mtter further at this time.

Mr. Goodwin then queried me in rogard to the reactions capabilities

Indiestel so far we have been unable to get any evidenoe to the

effect that this was being done. Mr. Kennedy questioned Mr.

Goodwin closely on this subjeet asking way he could not find

evidence when we knew this to be a fact. Mr. Goodwin said that

everything possible was being done to turn up this evidence but

without success. Mr. Kennedy then queried him as to what kind

of people were working on this for State. Mr. ielms interceded to

say that it was questionable whether Castro was taking such action

to the extent he used to take them but that he felt this tendency

to export Communian by way of ferrillas, aras, eto., had been

temporarily played in the lou key that CIA too had trouble in

turning up positive evidence singe 18 had been unable to do so

to date. Mr. Goodwin added that many allegations hal been made

against Cassto but no proof of Cuban agression had been proven

as yet. Be indicated the proof of 1t would de a distinet asset

to us at this time. He then said the US should probe harder fer

splitting the leaderahip in Cuba. Raul Castro, for examplo, 18 a

good possibility. We need a way to get next to this man. Mr.

Goodwin then said that there were overtones throughout the US that

the US was planning an avasion of Cube, that this vas detrimental

to our relationships worle-wide. Mr. 0ilpetrle and Mr. Kennedy

indiested that no matter what was being done, there would be runors

to this effeet and sush overtones would be veleed about the country,

that it was possibly becsuse we were wearing the anniversary of the

Mr. Goodrin indieated that the Plat Autonotive Company had

indicated to Castro that they vould provide him with the tractors

needed for $18,000,000, no down payment, ten years to pay. So

far Castro had not accepted this offer.

Mr. 01lpatrig who left at this time, indicated that he
