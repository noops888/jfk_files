- ADMINISTRATIVE -

Other references are not being set forth in this

report Inasmuch as Tampa, Office of Origin in instant matter;

has been submitting daily teletypes to the Bureau with copies

to this office, together with

a report every two weeks.

The period of this report begins September 1, 1961,

as previous investigation had been submitted to the Office of

Origin by letter.

All agents of the Miami Division have been

circularized with instructions to contact all CIs, PCIs,

PSIs, and SIs in an effort to locate subject in the Miami

area and to determine his activities.

All sources have

as of this date been unable to determine if subject 1s

in the Miami area and all report if he is in the Miami

area he is not active, as such activity would certainly

come to their attention.
