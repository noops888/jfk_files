AMBASSADOR REPORTS SOVIET REACTION TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S

ASSASSINATION

29 Now 63

--

In reference to 'the repetcussions in the Soviet Union to

the assassination of President : KENNEDY.

Basing the first on personal judgment and the rest on infor-

mation from reliable diplomatic sources, I will discuss the following

evaluations:

The deep grief produced 'here by' the above-mentioned assassina-

tion was absolutely spontaneous and due to the high culture of

the Soviet people which enables' them

rise above world

actions as

well as to the traditional Russian sentimentality.

As soon as the news was known, 'and in, the face of possible

international complications, the military authorities intensified

security measures which have now returned to normal.

High Soviet officials are preoccupied with':the stand; the

new President of the United States may take on everything regarding

Cuba, and, although MIKOYAN

seemed to have been (B val impressed)

after speaking with the President and other high-ranking United States

officials, they are moderately calm. Soviet leaders will wait

to learn how the matters of the purchase of wheat will be settled

in the United States as well as the reaching new.Ü.S.-Soviet cultural

agreement, for the purpose of gaining a clearer idea of the policy

in question.
