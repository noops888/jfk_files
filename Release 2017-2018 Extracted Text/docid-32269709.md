PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION

To obrain classinable fingerprints:

I Use printer's ink.

2. Distribute ink evenly on inking slab.

3. Wash and dry fingers thoroughly.

4. Roll fogers from nail to nail, and avoid allowing fingers to slip.

$. Be sure impressions are recorded in correct order.

6. Il an amputation or deformity makes it impossible to print a finger, make a notation to that effect in the individual finger

block.

%. If some physical condition makes it impossible to obtain perfect impressions, submit the best that can be obtained with a

memo stapled to the card explaining the circumstances.

8. Examine the completed prints to see if they can be classified, bearing in mind the following:

Most fingerprints fall into the patterns shown below (other patterns occur infrequently and are nor shown here) :

the Kennedy Autopsy photo

books. The photos removed from the

books were numbered 39E1, 39E2,

40E and 41E. This was two pages

consisting of 4 photos.

39El and 39E2 along with the cellophane

cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure

at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophane

enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan

and Svendsen

revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of

the Kennedy

Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was

begun to

ascertain

if any other

photos were missing. This check

by Flanagan and

Svendsen showed

no other photos to be missing

or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been

signed out

since September

of 1977 according

to the check out log.

Both Flanagan and

Svendsen stated

they would have noticed

photos when

the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978

if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They

feel there was no way this could have been done accidently.

Someone had to enter

the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked,

but shut.

Summary Of Contact:

On-this date Gary Cornwell and myself, spoke: with. Regis

Mr. Blahut stated the following:

1) He lied to us in our conversation of July 13 when he

stated that on the second occasion he looked through the

black looselead binder, he put it back on the window sill

after reading it. He told us that the truth was that while

he was looking through the book it dropped on the floor.

stated that when it dropped on the floor some of the pages

came out of the book. He became frightened that someone

would enter the room at this time so he opened the black

safe which contained the autopsy books and placed the black

top part of the safe. prior to him opening it to out in the

book, the safe door had been completely closed fi.e. not

pressing down on the handle and pulling the door open... He

time he did

not observe any of the photos to be out of

the plastic sheeting which ordinarily held them in the

black binder. Mr. Blahut denied however that he opened the

safe/at any time other than when he put the book inside.

2) He stated to us that the first time he had looked

through the book --the time when Jim Conzelman took it

out of the safe-- he slid one of the photos partly out

of the plastic to look at it. To the best of his

recollection this photo was either a photo of the brain

or a photo of the bust of Kennedy.

He stated this was the

only. time that 'he had observed any of the photos to be

out of their plastic sheeting.

Bob Blakey and I met with DCI Turner, DDCI Carlucci and

Ered Hitz Of the Office of Legislative Counsel at 8:00 A.M.

in Turner's office, Blakey initially noted that he had come

at Chairman Stokes' request to discuss with Turner a recent

security violation which had been discovered by the Committee.

Blakey began by describing to Turner the nature of the Kennedy

autopsy pictures, the restrictions under which the Committee

has acquired and possessed them, the security precautions

(separate safe, limited access, and log record) utilized to

safeguard them, and the possible motives that might exist for

someone unlawfully removing them from the Committee.

Blakey next described the circumstances and details of

the committee's discovery, made on 6/23/78, that the autopsy

photos had been

tampered with, and the investigation which

the staff thereafter conducted, including the identification

of all of those persons who had access. to the security space

where they were located, the fingerprinting process and

results, and ultimately the questioning of Regis Blahut,

the CIA employee who was in the security space on that date.

Finally, Blakey recalled to Turner his (Turner's)

statement made to Blakey and Cornwell on February 4, 1978,

to the effect that if the Committee found any impropriety

or wrongdoing on the part of any CIA employee, he would

personally look into and

get to the bottom of it. Blakey

stated that the Chairman had been told of Turner's comment

on February 4, 1978, and now requested that Turner conduct

a further investigation of the Blahut matter. Blakey stated

that the Committee felt such an investigation was necessary

for the following reasons:

1. The Committee had spoken to Blahut on three

occasions (July 11, 13. and 14) about his knowledge

of the tampering with the autopsy photos, on two

of which, by Blahut's own subsequent admissions,

he had lied about significant details, and on

the last of which, by independent evidence, Blahut

had also lied;

2 .

Blahut's actions were deliberate,

as evidenced

HH 52786 DocId: 32269709 Page 108

## Page 109

Admiral Stansfield Turner OCR

Page three

by the fact that Blahut had opened the Committee's

safe in which the photos were stored, and on the

first two interviews with the Committee, he lied

about having done so;

3.

There is only one possible innocent motive for

Blahut's handling and viewing of the autopsy photos,;

that being personal curiosity, and the evidence

unequivocally shows that personal curiosity was not

the motive la page was ripped out, a photo was re-

moved from the plastic sheeting, the log shows that

the photo book in question had not been

removed from

the safe by the Committee staff since September, 1977,

and Blahut's story about his handling of, and access

to that photo book on June 23, 1978 is patently un-

believable); and most significantly,

4.

Prior to at least two of the three occasions

on which Blahut was interviewed by the Committee

staff, he spoke to his superiors at the Agency, and

after each of those conversations he told lies to

the Committee about his involvement.

Turner said that he had already looked into the matter,

and handed us a report which had been written. Turner sug-

gested that Blakey and Cornwell go read the report (not take

a copy with them from the building), and also look at Blahut's

personnel file, and then let the Agency know what else he

(Blakey) suggested they should do.

Upon inspection, the report reflected the following:

(a.) The Agency interviewed Blahut on Friday evening,

July 14, and polygraphed him three times for roughly

two hours each time on Saturday, July 15;

(b.) Blahut's supervisors had been spoken to, and

denied any involvement;

(c.) Blahut admitted lying to the Committee;

(d.) Blahut basically told the same story to the.

polygraph expert (Felippo) he had finally told the

Committee on the morning of July 14, except that

on July 15 he admitted that he was never given

permission by any Committee staff member to view

the Kennedy autopsy pictures;

(e.) Blahut persisted in his story (but lied in

doing

so, according to the polygraph) that he had

opened the Committee safe only once, and that was

to put a photo book into the safe, and also (again,

untruthfully) stated that he had only viewed the

autopsy books on two occasions.

(f.) Blahut has been assigned to a CIA operation

code named MHCHILD since April, 1977.*

Office of Security Chief Gambino, and Carlucci's as-

sistant, Hav Smith, met with Blakey and Cornwell after they

had reviewed the investigative report provided by Turner.

Blakey requested

that

he be permitted to see Blahut's security

file.

Gambino refused, but offered the personnel file instead.

The personnel file reflected that Blahut had consistently

Finally, Smith and Gambino asked Blakey what he felt the

Agency should do now. Blakey said that full interviews of all

of Blahut's supervisors should be conducted, and written

reports made.

In addition, Blakey stated that new polygraphs

should be taken, focusing primarily on the area that was es-

•sentially omitted on July 15, namely, the question of motive.

Hav Smith asked whether the Committee was going to accept

the Agency's investigation after it was completed, he

said

he wanted to know now, that he wanted a commitment. Smith

said that he was 99 percent sure that the final report would

show no involvement in the tampering on the part of the Agency.

Gambino said, "We know we're clean." In reply, I asked how

the Agency could be so sure at this early point that none of

their employees except Blahut were involved, and I also com-

mented that Smith was

asking the Committee to "buy a pig in

a poke" in suggesting that we should tell him now whether or

not we would be

satisfied with the Agency's investigation

before

it was

even conducted. Both Blakey and I

stated that what we could now state was that we had come

to the Agency with the suggestion that they investigate it,

because we

felt that from among the alternatives now available

to the Committee, that alternative was the

one with the

best chance of success. Finally Blakey also noted that

his hope was that after the Agency's investigation was

complete, copies of the reports could be placed in the

Agency's and the Committee's files, and that would be the

end of it.

The meeting was terminated with the general understanding

that Blakey's

suggestions would be followed, and the Agency

would let us know when they had their reports complete.

The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located

of the Committeeoffices.

About 4:05 P.M. June 23, 1978 Mark Flanagan upon returning

some autopsy material to the

Security room along with Lance Svenason

of Security staff upon opening safe #102095 noted that several autopsy

photos were lying loosely on top of the other books. The photos

removed were 39E1, 39E2, 40 E and 41 E. This

was two pages consisting

of 4 photos. Photos 39 El and 39E2 had been ripped from the book.

One photo 39E2 was out of the cellophane enclosure and laying loose.

A quick check showed that these photos were from Book Five, Part One.

An immediate check of all books was begun by Flanagan and Svendsen

to ascertain if any other photos might be missing. No other photos

were found to be missing or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had

not been signed out recently according to the check out 1og.

Both Mark Flanagan and Lance Svendsen stated they would have noticed

the photos when the safe was open at 10 AM June 23, 1978 if they

had been lying were they were. They both feel there is no way this

could have been done accidently. Someone had to enter safe and do

this. The safe was unlocked but shut.

Aprroximately 5 P.M. June 23, 1978 at the request of Committee

Investigator Jack Moriarty three members of the Metropolitan Police

Identification section responded to Room 3381 for the purpose of

attempting to get latent prints. Pvt Pat McGinniss, Sgt Blake and

FROM:

Robert Morrison, Director of Security

William H. Cross, Assistant Director of Security

RE:

The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located

in Safe #102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381

of the Committee Offices.

About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon

returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with

Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095

noted that several Kennedy autopsy photos were looseson: top of

the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the

books were numbered: 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 4lE. This was two pages

consisting of 4 photos. 39El and 39E2 along with the cellophane

cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure

was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophan

enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen

revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy

Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was

any other photos were missing. This check

by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to

be missing

or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out

since September of 1977 according to the check out log.

Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated. they would have noticed the

photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978

if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They

both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently.

Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked,

but

shut.

Approximately 5 P:M. Friday, June 23, 1978 at the request

- of Committee Investigator John Moriarty, three members of the

section responded to Room

3901 for the purpose of attempting to get latent prints....

Iwas

able to lift 13s

separate cards of latent prints from the interior

of the safe, and from the Kennedy Autopsy photo book that was

tampered with. These men left at approximately 8:35 PM Friday

June 23, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty, William H. Cross

or Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey were present at all times

during the lifting of the prints. The lifted prints were turned

over to Investigator John Moriarty, and remained in his possession

The persons who were in this office alone on Friday June

23, 1978 were

of the

Committee Staff, and Regis Blahut of the CIA.

On Monday June 26, 1978 the 13 cards of prints lifted by

Pvt McGinnis were turned over to Director of Security Robert

Morrison by Investigator John Moriarty and locked in safe #45471

in Room 3381 of Committee Office.

On June 27, 1978, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to

the FBI for certain Committee Staff member fingerprint cards.
