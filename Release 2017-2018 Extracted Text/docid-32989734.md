÷"*?

ReBuTelCall ta me 3/12/58, and BuRad 3/21/68.

I have considered this matter, aiscussed it with

appropriate ajent and supervisory personnel of the Hobile

Office and the following is proposed as a counterintelligence

move on KINC'D lashington Spring Project.

+ + 4*

KiNG has quite a following in and around the Salma,

Ale, area and has appeared recently in Selma on one occasion

at the church of Reverend I. I. ANDERSON, who, aü the time of

KING's appearance, was zunning for mayor of Selma.

ANDERSON,

was tentatively endorsed by KiNG and was subsequently defeated

in his race for mayor of Selma.

Reverend FREDERICK DOUGLAS REESE, Who t& head of

the ballza County Voters League and 1s quite intluenciul among

the

Negro comunity in the selma area, did not endorse sliDERSoN

for mayor and iniorned sources indicate he more or less con-

tributed to the defeat of ANDERSON.

REtSE has been known to

make derogatory remurks concerning KING and was allegedly

miffed that kind did not advise him, REBSE, oi his, KINGS,

contemplated visit to selma.

In view of the above,

It is felt that if some

method can be devised whereby RENSE can be advised of certain

tens relative to the lashingion spring Froject, he would take

action to ciscourage indiviazals from participating therein.

has proven to be reliabie.

Alabama 35701, wherein it is called to the attention oi Rotst

that KING is merely using the Negroes of the Selma area for

in all probability the individuals going to Washington for

the Spring Project will be left stranded althout suitable

housing or lood. The letter should also play up the poss1b111-

ty of violence, particularly the fact that although CArMICHAEL

and BROWN of SNCC have a so-called gentlemens! agreenent with

KING not to take over this action, there exists a strong

possibility that such will oecur.

There is also the possibil1-

ty of RAM and NOI taking over the project since it lacks

organization and direction.

The letter should also point out

that KING was in Alabama on about 3/21/68, and did not make

his schedule in the Selma and adjoining counties area, which

was another indication that KING was talking out of both sides

of his mouth.

It is felt that this letter should be malled from

either Washington or Baltimore since, If the letter 19 mailed

from anywhere in the south, RussE may

• feel it is the work of

the Klan or some other racist group.

It is felt that Baltimore

would probably be the best since a letter from hashington would

indicate the possibility of the sovernment doing this.

Simultaneous with mailing the letter irom Baltimore,

it is proposed that a copy of the letter to REESE, together

and Publisher, Selma Times-Journal, Selma, Alabama.

letter should

indicate that attached was a letter directed to

REESE and that he, FALKENBERRY, might want to contact REESE

relative to REESE's receipt oi

The thought behind this is to elve FALKENBERRY a

chance to interview RusSE concerning recelot oi the letter

and thereby create a nems story which could legitinately be

published and read by the Negro community Inte Selma area.

By handling as above, we would eliminate the

possibility of these rumors being attributed to the FBI.

Consideration has been given to some method of

discouraging ALBERT TURNER, who 1s Meld Secretary for KING s

project, and is spear-headinz the recruitment throughout our

territory and other portions i Alabama.

From our contact

with TURNEr, who 1s a liaison source, it is the opinion of

contactin" agents that he is so sold on the project that it

Is almost impossible to disillusion him.

It is also felt that some method of getting an

article in the

"Southern Courier" along the lines of the above.

would have a discouraging effect on the Negro community in

and around Montgonery, Ala., since the Courier is very widely

read.

Consideration is being given to the method of accom-

plishing this.

set forth above and advise.

Concerning suggestions for the over all counter-

intelligence action, it is felt that the Bureau might consider

the creation of a paper Negro nationalist group for the

purpose of drawing together nilitant leaders and militant

groups in order to plant seeds of dissension anong such leaders. It

also should be considered that counterintelligence action

could be aimed against radical racial Leaders in any organization

by the use di reliable press contacts being given intormacion

which would sorve to discredit these leaders. Such intor-

nation, indicating that leaders are using the civil rijats

novenent for their own gain and ars not instituting prograns

ained at encouraging a Negro to help hinself, could be used

through reliable press contacts or responsible national

Negro leaders.

This type of action might serve to bring about

a feeling of distruct among radical Negro leaders.

Specific susgestions, as may be developed for

possible use in the counterintelligence field, will be sent to

the Bureau by sepsrate letter. Quarterly letters will be

submitted as sugsested.

Re Mobile letter to Miami dated 8/23/68.

Enclosed for Mobile is a copy of an article

an underground "hippie-type" newspaper

published in Miami, Florida.

of this publication was one

television program referred to in referenced letter.

The July 9, 1968, issue of "The Atlantic Sun",

a student publication at Florida Atlantic University' this

Boca Raton, Florida, contained an article concerning

television program.

It quoted JAMES AGUT, also interviewed

on this program, as complaining of the editing of this pro- '

He claimed the program's bias was clearly shown by

the Director's remarks at the end of the program.

The television producer said the response to this

program was so good that they went to the expense of repro-

ducing it so it could be made available to a number of

civic organizations who have requested it for local showing.

They gave one copy of the film to the Miami Office, at no

cost, and this has been sent to the Bureau.

This program was given considerable advance publi-

city and was shown at 6:30 PM on a Sunday evening which is

considered "prime time".

Other specific reactions of a positive nature on

a program of this type are difficult to assess, and probably

cannot be fully assessed for a considerable time.

Four staff members of HSCA recently completed

interviewing a number of RCMP personnel at RCMP Headquarters who

had been associated with the James Earl Ray investigation in

Canada. According to RCMP sources, nothing unusual was discussed

and the members were not asked any questions that would indicate

that any new material had been uncovered by the staff members,

who were very amiable and courteous throughout the contacts.

The RCMP is now in the process of contacting approxi-

mately 50 residents of Canada, who were interviewed by the RCMP

during the course of the investigation, to determine if they would

be willing to be interviewed in Canada by HSCA staff members.

The Canadian Government has taken the position that

no federal employee, with exception of RCMP personnel, can be

made available for interview and, therefore, people such as the

person(s) who accepted application for and issued Canadian

passport cannot be interviewed.

The comments, as set out in referenced Atlanta

and Chicago airtels, have been carefully reviewed by this

office.

This office does have & completely cooperative

and reliable newspaper source who could be contacted to

publicize the situation as discussed in referenced commun-

icacions.

However, at this time Baltimore does not recommena

such a contact for the purpose of a neuspaper article. The

Washington Spring Project has been making little headuay here

in Baltimore.

There is an office that functions, but the

office is not being operated very efrectively.

From our

sources, as well as the Police Department in Baltimore, the

entire project has

simply not been making any headway.

this reason, it is felt that at this time it would not be

desirable to give KING and the Washington Spring Project

any publicity of any kind which might reflect reaction in

his favor.

Baltimore, thererore, recommends that this

possibilly be kept in mind and if ai a later date, the

Washington Spring Project does get off the ground, then

consideration would be given to the suggestions as set out

in these referenced communications.

that the wsr has not gotten off the ground yet.

These

sources have reported in general terms that it was their

impression that one of the recsons for this failure to make

adcquate progress is the lack of assurance of MARTIN LUTHeR

the project, baild money and attorneys will be promptly

This was confirned by the Intelligence Unit

of the Baltimore City Police Departnent.

Hore specifically's a source reported that the

head of the intional dosociation For The Advancement or

Colored People here in Baltinore contacted the MSP with

this

specific question in mind. No adequate assurance

was given by the WSP office.

It is not known by Baltimore thee this is a

The Cambridge Black Action Federation (CEAF)

was organized In 9/57 at the suggestion of General. GEORGE

GastoN, Adjutant Generad, Maryland National Guard, When he

was contacted by a group or Cambridge, Maryland, Negroes

desired a way to make public the grlevances ot the Negro

community in Cambridge. It is a local groun with no national

It is estinated that there are only about 15 persons who are

actually considered members, but it presumes to speak for the

Negro community in Cambridge. It maintains contact with civi

rights groups both in Baltimore and Washington, D. C. Some

persons associated with this organization were

known to possess

shotguns and rifles used during riots in 7/07, according to

Chief of Police in Cambridge.

The persons associated with this

group were apparently active in those rious.

the CIG is used primarily by CONVAY, members of his family,

and several other people to pressure local authorities for

funds to pursue anti-poverty projects which are beneficial

to the CONWAYS.

One individual associated with this

at the Black Power Conference In 10/67 suggested that black

people arm themselves and be prepared to die.

This group

has not been Involved in any racial disturbances as far as is

known.

The Nation of Islam (NOI) has Temple #6 at

Baltimore, Maryland, and Temple 735 at Wilmington,

Delavare.

Both temples follow

the teachings and directives of ELIJAH

MUHAMMED. Temple is has an estimated 200 memberg; Temple

$35 has an estimated 45 members.

Persons associated with these

groups have not been engaged in any acts of violence and

not known to possess any weapons nor have they parcleipated

The head of Temple to Is CLYDE X, JONES,

aka CLYDE X. RAHALAN. The leader of Temple 135 is Minister

CARE X. HARDEN.

The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

(SNCC) recently opened an office in the 400 block of Fast

North Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, which is headed by ROBERT

B. MOORI.

MOORE is originally from Baltimore and several

years ago was active in Union for Jobs or Income Now (U-JOIn,

the Baltimore community action arm of Students for a Democratic

Soclety (SDS). MOORE was one of the speakers at meetings

held at Morgan State College in 3/68, the day before the college

was closed down for two days due to suudent demands.

The principal organization connected with the student

demands at Morgan State College was the society of Afro-

American Students (SAAS, a newly formed group of about 25

students of Morgan State College, which according to sources

was apparently formed with the advice of ROBERT MOORE.

The most active black nationalist group in the

Baltimore area is the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)

In the spring of 1966 a group of persons

on the national staff of CORE came to the Baltimore area and

took over the direction of civil rights activity which had

been originally started by the local CORE chapter.

This group

called themselves the Baltimore Target City Project. As a

result of their activity, the great bulk of the local coRe

chapter severed their connection with CORE and formed a new

organization which they called the Activists for Fair Housing.

They are now known as the Activists, Incorporated.

PersONs

associated with the CORE Target City Project have directed

or participated in practically all civil rights activities

in the Baltimore area, and they were also connected with the

activicles in Cambridge which resulted in riots there.

number of the activities of the CORE Target City Project

in Baltimore have resulted In arrests and in some cases of

persons associated with the CORE Target City Project being

charged with inciting to riot. Several persons associated

with CORt who have been more outspoken in favor of violence

than suited the CORE National Office have apparently been

discouraged from participating In CORE activities.

Recently intormation has been received reilecting

that a school called the

iwo individuals reported to be VIstA workers, LESTER VALLEY

and ALLEN NESBITT:

WILLARD DONOVAN DIXON and BENJAMIN MC MILLAN,

two local individuals who worked closely with the CORE Target

City Project

are now associated with the Soul School. Both

of these individuals were censured in the latter part of 1967

because of their advocacy of violence in a local CORE public-

ation, and it now appears that they are no longer associated

with CORE.

Re Bureau airtel to Albany, 3/4/68; and Baltimore

letter to Bureau, 4/3/68.

1,. Operations Under Consideration

the soul school, Baltimore, Maryland, is presently

being considered as a target for counterintelligence operations

by the Baltimore Office.

This school purports to exist for

the purpose of teaching

black history and culture.

Black

militants who are associated with the school are considered

among the most dangerous in the Balcimore area, Consideration

is being given to the possibility of bringing to the attention

o1 the Negro community the unsavory backgrounds of some of

these individuals who

are secting themselves up as educators

of the black community.

2. Operations Being Effected

No operations are presently being effected by the

Baltimore Office.

The suggestion submitted by Baltimore

airtel dated March 8, 1900, was not put into effect at that

time because the Poor People's Campaign (PPC) was getting

off to a poor start, The slaying of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.9

on April 4, 1900, made 1e inadvisable to carry forward any

further plans to

disrupt the Ppe by the means suggested,

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) has recently opened an office in Baltimore, Maryland,

In connection with the proposed march on Washington by

SCIC. A racial source of this office has advised that

prominently displayed in the office are photographs of

MUHAMMED ALI,ENE CASIUS CLAY. Copies

of the publication

MARTIN LUTHER KING' vunanned Speakg" and other literature

of the National of Islam (NOl) are available in this office.

Additionally, there is indication thai a representative of

the NOI in Baltimore has been in contact with SCIC represen-

tatives here.

It is recalled that in 1966, KING and ELIJAH

MUHAMMED were not able to regolve their differences at a

widely publized meeting of the two.

At the present time, the SCLO is making very poor

progress

in either getting organized, finding sufficient

people with funds to back the project, and in general

finding enough residents in Baltimore to go along with the

1des of such a march. Again according to our source, the

leaders of the SCIC here are talking of picking a particu-

lar area of the City of Baltimore and concentrating on that

area to gain support with the thought that thereafter to

spread to other parts of the city.

2.

The active, black nationalist movement in the

territory of the Birmingham Field Division is

• lintted to Muhammad's Mosque, Nation of ISlam

(NOI), Birninghan.

This Mosque has an estimated membership of about

75 nembers.

It has the normal activity of an NOI Mosque;

three meetings a week and occasional social affairs open

to the public.

Birmingham's estinate is that this losque does

not have a propensity for violence.

It is loyal to ELIJAR

MUHAMMAD and follons his teachings without reservation.

The minister, JANES LONDON, frequently derides "black power"

and teaches that they use violence only in ansver to

violence upon them.

The only "militant

black nationalist" included upon

the Rabble-Rouser Index is TOUMY WRENN.

WRINK was an

independent candidate for City Council, whose campaign

did not invoke any use ai violence.

WRINN is a subsistence

panacpate

He advised that the followig proposal was sent to

the Director:

The cacial conference at the SOG discussed the

Washington Spring Froject headed by MARTIN LUTHER KING and

recommended that the facts about the Project be brought to

the attention of possible participants through a rumor campaign.

We would use our informants, without their knowledge, to spread

the story about lack of funds and organization. Fears of

economic reprisal and personal safety should dissuade potential

participants. We would point out also that the Project is

strictly for MARTIN LUTHER KING's benefit which is actually

the case. He thinks he can regain lost prestige by this

demonstration. Some suggested rumors would consist of:

The participants would be told that their names

would be taken in Washington and welfare checks from the

Covernment discontinued.

Possible threats of violence and bodily harm to the

participants would be spread.

Also information showing that

the Washington, Negro Community is incensed and furious wich

espect to this march on Washington by outside Negroes.

The above are a few

of the type of sumors that can be

used and you should tie in any sumor of this nature to your local

problem.

Also think of other counterintelligence methods and

secure telephonic approval from the Bureau prior to utilization.

In accordance with instructions from Item

wide targets:

I. SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP

CONFERENCE (SCLC)

MARTIN LUTHER KING

A. KING has changed the date of his

Washington Spring Project (WSP) on several occasions;

he has, on occasion, announced his anticipated presence

at various locations, and then send a top aide instead

of appearing himself; he has periodically changed the

dates of his appearances in certain geographic areas.

Many times, announcements were made when KING was to be

at a specific WSP meeting in order to draw a crowd, when

actually it was known in advance by KING that he would

not attend.

• JN 100-980

It is felt the above considerations can

be exploited to cause confusion in the efforts of KING

and his group, and to cause Negro dissatisfaction with

his operating procedures. This could be accomplished

by the following:

1) When KING is actually to

be at a gathering, have informants circulate false in-

formation as

to time, date and location of KING's ap-

pearance, or variations of each, i.e., correct time and

place, but different location, correct location, but

different date, et cetera.

2) Have informants circulate

information that KING is to be at announced local meet-

ings of SCLC groups when, in fact, he will not be present,

3) Announce, through informant,

when KING is to be at specific place, that this is only a

guise to draw a crowd, and only local leaders will be

present, excluding KING.

B. KING and his top aides dress expen-

sively, generally travel via first class means., and

stay at first class accommodations usually in predomi-

nately white areas of cities he visits. Recently, in

Memphis, KING ran fron his followers when violence erupted

during a march he was leading there:

It is felt the above

two considerations could be linked to' discredit KING and

his aides with poor Negroes who he is seeking support from.

This could be accomplished by the preparation of a flyer

showing photographs of KING and aides dressed well, next

to photographs of Negroes poorly clothed; under the photo-

graph would be data concerning

his expensive tates, ac-

connodations, use of private airplane, and related data;

with this information would be information concerning

HW 54987 DocId: 32989734 Page 81

## Page 82

JN 100-980

KING's deserting his followers during the Memphis riots.

The key note message would be that KING and his aides

are out for their own financial and physical welfare

primarily. Flyers could be prepared from newspaper

photographs of KING and his aides, or from some photo-

graphs available at various field offices. Distribution

could be by anonymous mailings to poor Negro leaders,

or by placement of copies at Negro meeting places by

informants.

II. STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING

COMMITTEE (SNCC)

This group has discouraged its members

from associating with whites. Information has been de-

veloped that some leaders and top functionaries, since

the establishment of this policy, have periodically

maintained close associations, to

include residing with

white girl friends. Information concerning these asso~

ciations could be capitalized on by counterintelligence

measures to show the hypocrisy of these leaders and to

discredit the individuals involved with their new "Black

only" oriented associates in the same organization, and

to discredit them with leaders of other Black Nationalist

organizations withhom they may be seeking support or

rapport.

Specifically, efforts could be undertaken

to obtain photographs of the principals involved with

their white girl friends. The flyer could then be pre-

pared containing this photograph or photographs. Under

the photograph could be information regarding the princi-

pals' position with SNCC, followed by quotations of top

SNCC leaders regarding associations with whites or

Black Separatists statements. The flyers could be mailed

anonymously to pertinent National and local leaders of

SNCC and/or to leaders of other Black Nationalist organiza-

tions advocating black separatism, rather than simply

I.

OPERATIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION

By letter forwarded to the Bureau by Jackson

on May 11, 1968, the Jackson Division requested approval

for a counterintelligence measure against the three main

Student Non-violent Coocdinating Committee (SNCC) func-

tIonaries in Mississippi - ROBERI EARL FLETCHER, JR.,

HOWARD HERSCHEL SPENCER, and MARVIN LOUIS WILSON, all

Negro males.

This measure was designed to discredit these

three individuals by implying that each of the three are

informants of some Mississippi Law Enforcement Agency.

1- Bureau,

6/7/76

st.

The measure was to be initiated by submit-

ting

¡ separate anonymous letters to SNCC Headquarters in

Atlanta, Georgia, addressed to each of the three individuals.

Each letter would thank the addressee for providing certain

specified bits of intelligence

information regarding SNCC

II. OPERATIONS BEING EFFECTED

Bureau approval has not yet been received re-

garding operation being considered which is mentioned above.

The Jackson Division has effected some opera-.

tions through rumor campaign initiated regarding the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) Poos People's Campaign

The following measures were implemented:

A. On April 24, 1968, JN 380-R (PROB -

GHETTO) returned from Washington, D.C., where she was ar

rested with 35 others on April 22, 1968, while conducting

silent vigil around National Capitol building.

Source was

fined $700, given suspended jail sentence, and placed on

one year's Federal Probation for her participation in vigil;

source advised others arrested received similar serious

penalties for involvement. Source, on retuch to Mississippi;

was encouraged by handling Agents to publicize her arrest anc

punishment to prospective Poor People's Campaign participants

as indication of severe manner in which they would be dealt

with by Washington officials if they went there with the

Poor People's Campaign. Source is a state leader in a pre-

dominately Negro Welfare Rights Group and is well regarded

by Negro poverty elements in Mississippi; source was subse~

quently veryvocal in making known her arrest and punishment

in Washington, D.C., to Mississippi prospective Poor People's

Campaign participants.

B. JN 386 - R (PROB) was, and still is, the

Jackson Organizer for the Poor People's Southern Caravan.

SURY DENTIAL.

NH 54987 DocId: 32989734 Page 85

## Page 86

JN 100-980

CONFE TINL

He was encouraged by contacting Agents to emphasize

non-violent objective of Poor People's Campaign and

to be alert for any militant Negro infiltrators of

Southern Caravan who had propensity for violence. He

was instructed to likewise advise and alert his lieu-

tenants in this regard and to make it known around

the Jackson area that no militants would be acceptable

as POOr People's Campaign participants.

IlL. TANGIBLE RESULTS

Regaraing A. above, in no small measure

due to JN 380 - R (PROB - GHETTO'S) "arrest publicity"

efforts, participation by older, mature, poverty-stricken (X

Mississippi Negroes in the Southern Caravan of the Poor

People's Campaign was minimal. The majority of the Miss-

issippi participants were youthful people, Negro males

and females.

Regarding B. above, JN 386 - R (PROB)

was personally instrumental in screening out many mili-

tant Negro youths from participating in any manner in

the Southem Caravan portion of the Poor People's Campaign.

He was especially watchful for anyone in any manner asso-

ciated with SNCC and any allegations he received in this

regard were grounds for automatic elimination of individual

as Southern Caravan participant.

IV. DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

INTEREST

The Jackson Division has disseminated per-

tinent information regarding known Mississippi Black

Nationalist militants to all appropriate local and. State

law enforcement officials. They, in turn, carefully

scrutinize activities of these individuals

for any indi-

cations that they may be breaking State or local laws.

Any violations result in rapid arrest. In this regard,

ROBERT EARL FLETCHER, JR., and DONALD WILSON JACKSON, Negro

Black Nationalist Militants from Jackson, Missisappi, have

each been arrested once by local authorities on minor in-

fractions over the past four months.

Additionally, any information received of

out-of-state Black Nationalists traveling to Mississippi,

is immediately furnished local and State authorities;

these authorities likewise scrutinize activities of these

out-of-staters while in Mississippi, for any indications

of law-breaking.

Recently, two SNCC members from Tennessee,

following FBI alert to local authorities, were stopped on.

traffic violation;

their automobile was

searched and con-

cealed weapons and drugs were found, resulting in more

serious charges; charges are still pending and individuals

involved were released on bond and immediately returned to

Re Charlotte letters to Director dated 7/9/68.

I. Operations Under Consideration

In connection with HOWARD LAMAR FULLER (Agitator

Index Subject), records of FULLER's telephone toll calls

were received

from the Durham, N. C., Police Department and

investigation is presently being conducted to identify all

subscribers both within North Carolina and out of state to

develop his contacts. On analyzing the results of this

investigation, the recommendations will be made based on

available information as to what actions may be taken to

undermine FULLER's effectiveness as an organizer.

Recent information received from CE 2319-R (PROB)

to the effect that GOLDEN ASRO FRINKS, Field Secretary.

SCIC for North Carolina, is losing favor with the national

leadership of SCIC. According to this source, a state-wide

convention will be held later this year at which time efforts

will be made to replace FRINKS, Who is currently conducting

daily demonstrations in Hyde County, N. Ca, in protest of

a school desegregation plan accepted by Department of Health,

Education and Welfare. Separate letters will be submitted

concerning this matter on development of further information.

3. Tangible Resulta

It should be noted that according to information

received, HOWARD LAMAR FULIER's foundation for community

development, Durham, N. C.. Will expend its funds as of

10/1/68. His activitles after that date should be curtailed

due to lack ot money for his travel expenses. This matter

is being followed closely to determine the source of many

new funds.

4 Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

With the start of the 1968-1969 school year and

the re-opening of colleges, racial activity within the

Charlotte Division should increase. It should be pointed

out that there are numerous predominantly Negro institutions

throughout the state, most of which have some type Afro-

American organization on the college campus.

Charlotte has alerted its sources for any militant

activity in this regard, and the Bureau will be kept advised.

CE 2319-R (PROB) is in a position to assist in any

counterintelligence program mounted against COLDEN ASRO FRINKS

and to furnish detailed information concerning FRINKS. It

is anticipated that if sufficient information is developed

through this informant and in view of the voluminous

background data in the Charlotte files regarding FRINKS, a

proposal for counterintelligence activity will be made.

Charlotte was recently quite successful in a

counterintelligence program concerning Klan and militant

white groups wherein with Bureau permission data of a

public source nature was furnished to a trusted newspaper

reporter, who wrote a series of articles. It is anticipated

that all development of the proper information, the same

type operation can be proposed against FRINKS.

IN RE JAMES RUFUS BARROW:

Charlotte File 157-5813

Bureau File 157-7782

This Individual is on the Agitator Index of the

Charlotte Division and resides at 406 Van Norton Street,

Washington, No C.

Subject In April of this year organized a group

of approximately 300 Negroes to disrupt the school activities

at P. S. Jones High School, a Negro high school in Washington,

N. C. He has continued some degree of agitation in Negro

high schools throughout the area and has claimed to be associated

with the NAACP and the SCLo.

This Individual 1s well known to local authorities

as an alcoholle, and Information has been received indicating

that he may transport and use personally non-tax paid whisky.

Investigation has also reflected that this subject

has lost his driver's license on two occasions, once while

driving Intoxicated and once for driving while his driver's

license was under revocation.

Through Informants and local police department

activities, Charlotte feels that an occasion may arise in

the future

to know the occasion when BARROW w111 have

non-tax paid whisky in his automobile or otherwise in his

possession, and Charlotte feels that such Information

properly handled could result in this individual being

removed as a source of agitation in the Eastern North

Carolina area.

A conviction for possession of non-tax paid

whisky or driving while intoxicated, second offense, should

result in the Immediate loss of his driver's license for

probably a year, which would tend to curtail this individual's

travel ability, and possession of non-tax paid whisky could

result in an active jail sentence, which would remove him

completely from the scene of operation.

REQUEST OF THE BUREAU:

The Bureau is requested to consider and approve,

II deemed advisable, the furnishing to the appropriate local

and State authorities Information concerning this individual

having in his possession non-tax paid whisky, or while driving

under the influence, which it 1s anticipated would result in

his arrest and possibly receiving an sotive jail sentence.

IN RE GOLDEN ASRO FRINKS:

Bureau File 157-7975

This individual is on the Agitator Index of the

Charlotte Division and this individual 1s Field Secretary

and Director of the SCIC and operates primarily in the Hyde

County area of North Carolina at the present time. As the

Bureau 1s aware, this Individual has been a source of

considerable agitation and Interference in Hyde County of

the operation of the public school system.

He is currently

leading a boycott of Negro students of Hyde County schools,

and this matter has been presented in detail to the Bureau in

## Page 97

CE 157-6109

Through CE 2319-R (PROB), Charlotte has learned

that FRINKS 18 allegedly carrying on an 111101t affair with

a Negro teenager, a cheerleaders at the 0. A. Peay High

school.

The girl allegedly Involved with FRINKS 15 thirteen

years old, and it is felt that this information can be

utilized very effectively and possibly result in criminal

charges being brought against FRINKS.

It is contemplated

that such Infornation relating to FRINKS, as his contributing

to the delinquency of a minor, as well as possible adultery

charges, would severely discredit him and might posaibly

result in his loss of position with scLe.

In addition to the above, FRInks 1s known to

drive at excessive rates or speed in his travels Iron one

location to another, and it is felt that through proper

11a1son with the No

C. Highway Patrol, FRINKS can more

closely be observed in his travels, which will result 1n

his arrest for traffio violations relating to speed.

According to Information from CE 2319-R (PROB),

FRINKS has had some criticism from SCIC leaders concerning

his school boycott operations in Hyde County, N. C.

It 1s felt that the successful handling of oither

the first or second operations listed above could likeiy

result in charges or possible conviction and an active

jail sentence, which would remove FRINKS from the area as

an agitator, and at the same time, further discredit him

personally and the SCIC generally in the Hyde County, N. Co,

area.

This could lead to his further difficulty with national

leaders of the scIo.

REQUEST OF THE BUREAU:

The Bureau is requested to consider and approve,

Li deened advisable, the furnishing of Infornation to the

proper authorities concerning FRINKS' alleged 1111c1t affair

with a thirteen-year-old high

school girl, and the close

counterintelligence operations pending Bureau approvad.

SUMMARY OF BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

JACKSONVILLE DIVISION

The Black Mationalist: Movement in the Jacksonville

Division

is a relatively new movenent and is not clearly defined.

Informant and source coverage is under development and it is

anticipated that a more definite picture will be provided in the

near future..

The main activities are centered in the Gainesville

area: of Florida where the following organizations exist:

Students For A Democratic Society (SDS)

Gainesville,

Florida

SDS was organized in Gainesville, Florida, in 1966.

It has operated as an off-campus organization in that the

University of Florida has refused to recognize it as a campus

organization, At the time of organization, its membership was

Iisted as being 16 members.

Committee (SSOC) and the group was

then known as SDS-SSOC.

Later SDS was dropped from the name of the group:

SSOC has been described as the local branch of SDS.

reportedly,

At the niversity of Florida, the two groups impression of yet

are promoted as different groups

to give the

another "new-left" organization.

During January, 1967, SDS demonstrated in behalf of

During July, 1987, SDS sponsored the "Viet Nam

Summer Florida. Institute"

at Gainesville, Florida, which was

a part of the national protest movement against the war in

Viet Nam.

Since December, 1967, SDS has participated In a

rally against support of the draft, against compulsory

ROTC, and against recruitment by the Central Intelligence

Agency and Dow Chemical Company on the University of Florida

campus.

"The Florida Alligator," daily wampus newspaper,

University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, carried an

article in its 2/19/68 issue captioned,

"New Left Fever

Appears Dead."

The article pointed out that "despite their

recent efforts SDS has found it nearly impossible to arouse

significant student interest." There is, however,

a potential

for violence by an organization such as SDS, especially it

it gains sufficient support in the future from students at

the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida,

Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC)

Gainesville,

Florida

The SSOC at Gainesville, Florida, has been described

.as the local branch of SDS and is supposedly promoted as a

different group to give the impression of yet another "new-left"

organization.

A letter released by the "Viet Nam Summer (Florida

Project)," Gainesville, Florida, sponsored by SSOC-SDS, during

July, 1967, stated that SSOC will open a Florida regional

office in Gainesville.

deed suit literature, dealers wise an

to arrange conterences on movement issues for the State of

Flonida.

ALAN THOMAS LEVIN, Vice Chairman of SSOC, on 10/9/67,

was described as founder of the Florida Draft Resistance

Union in Gainesville, Florida.

On 1/12/68, SDS-SSOC, Gainesville, had a meeting

to discuss what action should be taken against future military.

and private industry recruiters on the campus of the

University of Florida.

A protest against Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) recruitment on 1/15/68 proved

ineffective.

On 1/27/68, SSOC sponsored the "Florida Conference

fox Peace and Freedom" on the campus of the University of

Florida.

ANTHONY KENNETH IRVING, student at Florida

A & M. University, Tallanassee, Florida, made a statement

at this meeting to the effect that black people in the

restaurants could poison all the food for "whitey." If

a black man-can. Kill five whites,

then he can die knowing

that he tried to overthrow the white system.

CHARLES WRIGHT, possibly a student from A & M

University, Tallahassee,

Florida, stated at this meeting

that he would be willing to personally lead a black army

through the residential streets of white America.

SSOC organized demonstrations against Dow Chenical

Company recruitmeni on the University of Florida campus

on 2/9 and 2/9/58.

SSOC is closely associated with SDS and may be one

and the same organization.

If it could gain a following and

support to carry out lis objective, It could present a

definite potential for violence.

Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)

Gainesville, Florida

On 2/8/68, they were released on bond by order of the.

While DAWKINS and THOMAS were in jail, a number of fires

were started by incendiary devices in white businesses in

•Negro areas of Gainesville as well as the home of Judge

Police Department, on an arson charge.

On 3/18/58 another

SNCe, Iwhich is composed of DAWKINS and a

followers, are believed to have been responsible for the

burnings in Gainesville, Florida.

While the burnings have ceased, since the arrest

Of DAWKINS and the five individuals there is always the

potential for additional incidents by sympathizers of

other followers of DAWKINS who were not arrested.

ILL TANGIBLE RESULTS

The Bureau has been advised by separate

communication of the favorable results received

fron the TV program which was produced under

captioned matter.

Tapes of this program have been

made available by WCKT-TV, Miami, to local civic

organizations fon their use...-

The Bureau has also been advised of some of the

statements made by JAMES RUSSElL AGUT, who was interviewed

during this progian. AGUT expressed his displeasure

in the program as it was shown on TV.

The August, 1968, edition, Volume 1, #6,

of "The Libertarian Watchdog", an underground hippy-type

newspaper published in Miami, Florida, contained an

article by 1t5 editor-publisher, ROBIlT E. SCHWAETZ,

who aiss was interviewed on this TV program. SCEWARTZ

complained he was interviewed in a friendly, relaxed

manner by an employee of the TY channel whereas the

questions were turned around and the interviews edited

to show them in a very unfavorable light.

He also

complained that the quotations by Director J. EDGAR

HOOVER at the end of the program were presented in a

much stronger light than were the interviews.

SCHWARTZ

indicated he desired in the tradition of "fair play"

prime IY time so that a program may be presented in

rebuttal to this program.

IV, DIVELOPMENTS OF COUNTERINTILLIGINCE INTEREST

A. Organizations

1.

NOI

Mosque 29 of the NOI is located within the

Miami Division and has approximatily 85 to 100 members.

Twenty-five to 30 of these have been described as hard-

core members; others consists of a constant membership

turnover.

This group has

been established in Miamt for

several years and never known to have been involved in

any acts of violence.

Members are subjected to the

nationalistic and hate-type teachings and philosophies

of the parent organization.

Being under the directi.

supervision of ELIJAH MUHAMMAD, the NOI in Miami appears

to have a propensity for violence only if directed to

violence by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD or if they or their properties

are attacked.

The Miami leaders of this

of the national organization. "conservative" and under their

group have been described as

current leadership, CORE in Miami does not appear to have

any propensity for violence.

3. SCLC

SCIC in Miami is also a relatively small group,

with attendance at their weekly meetings ranging from

six to twenty persons.

Their main interest and activities

appear to center around Miami's EOP program and they have

apparently little national direction.

The President of

SCLC in Miami was arrested by local authorities on

March 22, 1968, for grand larceny in connection with

anti-poverty funds SCLC in Miami has received.

The Miami Office is currently conducting an

investigation captioned "JIMMIE LEE CHATMON, PRESIDENT,

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE, MIAMI, FLORIDA;

ATROS L. LA SALLE, CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT,

FRAUD

AGAINST

THE GOVERNMENT" (Miami file 46-3743).

Basis for

this investigation is an allegation that. SCLC in Miami

submitted false documents to EOP, a federally-funded

program, concerning the accounting systen utilized by

SCiC.

B. Individuals

• 1. ALFRED DWIGHT AMOS FEATHERSTON

FEATHERSTON is an SI subject of the Miami Office

and has resided within this territory for approximately a

year.

Prior to his arrival in Miami, he reportedly attended

NOI meetings, professed admiration for MALCOLM X, Claimed

contact with FIDEL CASTRO, and expressed a knowledge of

and a desire to obtain plastic explosives. He was

arrested in July, 1959, in Guatemala in connection

with a plot to assassinate the president of that

country.

In 1964, he claimed he was going. to assassinate

two southern governors and said it would be a good idea

to assist the CP in eliminating President JOHNSON.

## Page 159

ИМ • 157-2414

Since his arrival in Miami, FRITHERSTON 1s

not known to have associated with any Black Nationalists

He is not known to have expounded

Black Nationalist feelings and therefore, at the present

time,

is not considered as potentially dangerous in con-

nection with this program.

=... 2.

JOHN STROMAN

JOHN STROMAN of West Palm Beach, Florida, was

involved in the racial disturbances at Pompano, Florida,

during the summer of 1967.

Information has recently been

received that STROMAN has joined the Merchant. Marine and

has left the South Florida area. Investigation is being

conducted to verify his departure from this area.

3. CHARLES HENRY WRIGHT

WRIGHT, a native of Georgia, has resided within

the Miami Division for approximately four years.

attended Miami-Dade Junior College and Florida Atlantic

university,

Boca Raton,

Florida.

He apparently dropped

out of Florida Atlantic University within the past few

months and indications are now that he has left the

South Florida area. Investigation is being conducted

to determine his current whereabouts.

WRIGHT has predicted i total racial war if the

demands of the black people were not met. He has

described the United States as the "cradle of races

in the world" and is a backer of the "black power"

philosophy. He has said the United States is doomed;

racial war

1s imminent unless black pomer demands are

fully met.

WRIGHT was unsuccessful in an attempt to form

an SNCC chapter at Miami-Dade Junior College and reportedly

is a current member of ssoc.

III. Those Being Considered for

• Current Intelligence Action

A. Organizations

•1. NOI

peter sti

---

## Page 160

HM 157-2414

The teachings and philosophies expounded by

the NOI are such that they should always be considered

as having & propensity for violence and therefore, the

Miami Division is considering counterintelligence

activities which might be taken against that organi-

zation within the Miami territory.

2. SCHC

Inasmuch as the SCLC is a loosely disciplined

outfit whose membership is open to any Negro in the area,

with very little discipline or self-sacrifice required,

this organization appears to be the only organization

within the Miami territory which could constitute a

rallying point for Black Nationalists who do not desire

or are unable to accept the discipline of the NOI. This,

together with the assumption that SCIC will be the focal

point for people from the Miami area desirous of par-

ticipating in MARTIN LUTHER KING's march on Washington,

would mark them as potentially dangerous. • The current

criminal investigations being conducted on the leader-

ship of this group would make them apparent easy prey

for counterintelligence activities.

B. Individuals

No individuals are being considered for action

under this program at the present time.

IV. Suggestions

Miami suggests that former members of Black

Nationalist groups, particularly the NOI, not be over-

looked in this intelligence program.

Former NOI members

who have been exposed to the hate teachings of that

organization but are no longer subjected to its

discipline should often be considered as potentially

dangerous with regard to racial matters.

V.

Miami is submitting a separate letter with

die.

Miami's SCLC Chapter raised approximately $3,000

to send local participants to the Poor Peoples Campaign

in Washington, D. C.

They decided to charter a bus for

their trip to Washington, and when it appeared they would

not have sufficient people to fill a chartered bus,

Greyhound officials recommended they travel on regularly

scheduled bus.

These people, however, insisted on

chartering a bus with a capacity for 38 persons at a

cost of almost $1400 for the round trip.

A total of 14 or 15 people traveled to Washington.

in this bus departing Miami 5/15/68.

Some of these

people remained in Washington or went on to New York City

on vacation after participating in the program and only

nine returned to Miami from Washington on the bus,

arriving Miami 6/24/68.

This chartered bus was an obvious waste of

money.

Had these people traveled to Washington via

regularly scheduled bus service, round trip fare for

nine persons would have been $50.35 each and one-way fare

for six persons would have been

$33.35 each for a total

cost of $675.75. These people, therefore, wasted over

$800 by travel on chartered bus.

If these participants

had flown regularly scheduled Eastern Air Lines flights

to Washington, their total cost would have been only

$1244.25.

It is noted that the money raised in Miami was

raised specifically in the name of the Poor Peoples Campaign,

and it appears there must be considerable money not used

or needed for this program.

Miami's SCLC Chapter already has a poor reputa-

tion in connection with handling funds, particularly in

view of the fact the former President of Miami SCLC's

Chapter is currently under indictment for Grand Larceny

in

connection with EOPI funds handled through SCLC.

This

fact, together with the money wasted on the Poor Peoples

Campaign, presents an excellent opportunity for action

under captioned program.

Most of this information has been discussed

openly at SCLC meetings.

Bureau authority is requested to

furnish this information to CLARENCE JONES, a staff writer

for the "Miami Herald." Miami Office has had an excellent

relationship with JONES and information has been furzished

him confidentially in the past without his revealing the

Bureau as a source of this information.

If Bureau authority is granted to furnish

this

information to JONES, he will be impressed with the

action ti

necessity of not revealing the Bureau's identity as

a source of this information. Miami Office feels this

action will in no way result in embarrassment to the Bureau.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAH

BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS

RACIAL INTELLICENCE

Re Bureau airtel to Albany dated 3/4/68, and

Kiant letter to Bureau dated 4/2/68.

The following points are being considered for

counterintelligence activity in connection with this program

within the Miani Division.

No action, of course, will be

taken without Breau authority:

NATION OF ISLAM (NOI)

Mosque Number 29, of the NOI in Miami, currently

operates a commissary selling canned goods and staples, and

thoy also operate a restaurant.

These businesses are both

operated at the Temple.

It has also been determined

that at least one member of Mosque Number 29 is Living at

the Temple.

Miami will check with local authorities concerning

these activities, and 1f it is determined that any of these

activities are in violation of local ordinances, consideration

wild be given 10s the use in Miami Counterintelligence

Program. Action to be recommended will not, of course, be

werely harassment, but will be an attenpt to discredit

this organization in the eyes of sone of the legitinate

Negro business people in the Miami ares.

It is noted that

Mosque Number 29 recently has made an effort to pronote

themselves within this group.

Another situation which appears to have some

local counterintelligence potential,

is the present

suspension from the NOI of SAMUEL SAXON.

SAXON has been

Captain of Mosque Number 29 for the past several years and

is a long time resident of Miami.

He was a very close

associate of CASSIUS CLAY and clains credit for recruiting

Clay in the noi.

Inforuation now available indicates

SAXON's suspension was in some way connected with a

misappropriation of Mosque Number 29's funds..

Bureau

authority has been received to intervier SAXON and alter this

interview, Iurther consideration will be given to a

counterintelligence activity in connection with this

natter.

SCIC

In connection with counterintelligence activity

against ScId, the Agent to whom the coordination of this

Program is assigned is going to assist the Agents handling

the Fraud Against the Government case involving Miami SCLE

Chapter mentioned in referenced Miant letter.

Through

these interviews it is expected that a counterintelligence

plan can be developed.

RECENT COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

ACTIVITY BY THE MIAMI

DIVISION

It is noted for the Bureau that with Bureau

authority JOIN TYUCT, Chief, Security Section, Dade County

Departnent of Pubiic Instruction, was advised on February 28,

1968, that ALVIN FRANKLIN DEAN, a teacher in the Dade

County, Florida, school systen, and an assistant minister

and trequent speaker at hosque Number 29, had been convicted

In Knoxville, Tennessee, for nolesting somen. On barch 7,

1967, TYLER advised that DEAN's arrest and conviction had

been

veriiied by him and that DEAN had been released fron the

Dade County School Systen in accordance with their regulations.

Re Kiant letter to the Bureau, 8/28/68.

The black nationalist movement within the Miami

Division has changed somewhat since submission of referenced

• letter. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

whose charter was revoked almost a year ago had been operating

officially under the name of "Poor Peoples Campaign Support

Group" although they had been accepted in the Miami area as

an SCLC chapter.

They have become almost completely inactive

since the Republican National Convention at Miami Beach in

August, 1968.

They do not hold regular neetings and have

not organized or supported any particular civil rights

activity. Their only objective since the Republican National

Convention reportedly has been to attempt to collect money

to pay telephone bills occurred during the Republican National

Convention and the "Poor Peoples Campaign".

JIMMIE LEE CHATMON, former president of the Miami

SCLC, an agitator index subject

• of the Miami Office appears

to

have

become completely inactive in the civil rights movement

in this area.

He has no known following and is not known

presently to be associated with any organization.

He is still

awaiting trial for grand larceny charges pending against him

in local court.

With the commencing of a scholastic year the United

Black Students (UBS) has re-established itself at the Univer-

SIty OI mlami and is attempting to organize on the campuses

of Miami Dade Junior College.

from this post in November, 1968, and a permanent successor

has not yet been selected.

He clained his resignation was

based on acadenic reasons.

Since referenced letter, JIMMIE LEE CHATMON,

mentioned above, and THOMAS NICADOMAS SCOTT have been

added

to Miami's agitator index.

SCOTT is not connected with any

organization and reportedly only has a small following of

young Negro hoodlung.

I. Operations Under Consideration

Miami is considering resubmitting a request to

the Bureau to capitalize on recent allegations that the

minister of Mosque 29 of the NOI in Miani has been having

an affair with a female member of that mosque.

Such allega-

tions have been circulating as rumors among members of

Mosque 29 and

the kiami Office hopes to capitalize on this

through the submission of an anonymous letter to NOI Head-

quarters in Chicago alleging the minister is having such an

aLIaLI.

II. Operations Being Effected

The counterintelligence progrim is being considered

in connection with Miami's interview program of members of

the NO1.

Approximately 15 NOI menbers and leaders have been

interviered

since submission of referenced letter and it is

anticipated that 9 or 10 members will ba interviewed or

re-interviewed in the near future.

III. Tangible Results

It has been reported by NOI informants that the

minister of losque 29 appears quite upset by FBI interviews

of him and other members. He seems to fear the effect such

interviews will

have on members and at neetings has threatened

members with drastic action

'if they cooperate with the FBI

when interviewed. Members are told never to cooperate with

the FBI unless they agree to make an appointment for an

-taterview at which time, he, the minister, should be

present.

He told members to ask contacting agents if

they have a warrant and if they do not haye a warrant

the FBI has no right to talk to them.

The minister's

frequent reierral to the FBI interviews have resulted in

xembors ridiculing him behind his back because he becomes

soupset at these interviews.

the minister, thus, is

Loosing the confidence somewhat of his members and addi

tional interviews with this point in mind should have an

even greater effect on the menbership's attitude towards

him.

V.

Miscellaneous

It maz mentioned in referenced letter that an

assistant captain of Mosque 29 was apparently guilty of

bigamy and this would be exploited under captioned program.

RED 157-1291

I. Operations Under Consideration:

NIO recently subnitted a proposal to the Bureau

regarding a "word of mouth" cunterintelligence neasure nong

selected sourcas to be directed against STOKOLY CARMICE 3L In

an attempt to create the impression within the ghetto camunity

that he is in fact a paid agent of the Government.

In addition, it could be inferred that Government agents

are maintaining close

tabs on CARMICHARL's bezeabouts at all

times in order to afford him protection, not just in WDC, but

throughout the U.s.

The above is belleved to be one of perhaps a few

counterintelligence measures that could be effective against

CARMICHAEL. Any allegation of immorality or illegal activity

would only anhance his reputation within the ghetto.

CARMICHAEL, has not gone through with the purchase of

the $70,000 house, but it should not be overlooiced that he is

already living in a house valued near $50,000, which a source

has reported is to be completely refurnished and has already

been carpated throughout.

WED will recommend dissemination to

appropriate neug media

in this respect in the near future.

WTO will continue to remain alert to situations wherein

a counterintelligence measure would be timely against the various

hate groups and individuals Involved therewich.

It ghould be borne in mind; however, that any sounter-

intelligence neasure against any of these groups of individuals

requires a different approach than the usual counterintelligence

program. As pointed out above, regarding CArMICHAEL, any

Immoral or illegal act improves their Image within the ghetto

community.

In additton, the very nature of some of the Individuals

which comprise these groups lends.to a certain disurity. fit -

itself as Illustrated within Resurrection City. Perhaps more.

thought should be given to breeding discontent within the varioas

groupst

which if successful, would render a leader "groupless.":

HEO 157-1292

II. Operations Being Effected:

As pointed out above, WFO has submitted a proposal

to the Bureau regerding CARlICHAEL and will implement same upon

authorization by the Bureau.

III. Tangible Results:

HEO was in the process of submitting a recommendation

regarding the purchase of a $70,000 house by CARMICHAEL, proposing

release of this information to appropriate news media for

publication upon consumation of the purchase, when news articles

regarding this purchase appesred. As the Bureau is aware,

CARMICHAEL, and MIRIAM MAKEBA thereafter cancelled the contract

any, hi proper ela ponted oil, yes had aruitable

on his reputation among some black militants.

IV. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest:

It is noted that WED has continuously considered what

would be effective counterintelligence measures against various

hate groups and: certain individuals such as CARMICHAEL. The

April, 1968, riots in WIC and the presence of the "Poor Peoples

Campaign" has certainly influenced the course of action by some

of thesa groups and has in. fact been responsible for the creation

of others.. The "Black United Front" (BUF), which CARMICHAEL

formed, has been more noticeably active as

of late and recently,

for example, took a definite stand on the shooting of two white

policemen by a Negro robbery suspect and his accomplice in the

sbooting, stating black men have 3 right to defend themselves

againat the "honky" policenens

The news media has been dominated by the above since the

assassination of DI. MARTIN LUTHER RING, JR., and perhaps calls

for a different approach to an effective counteringelligence pro-

gram. than prior to the Ilots. It Is further felt that a more af

effective: use of news sedia could be made In the future in that

an article may receive nore attention hamz during the past few

months

WED will remain alert to situationg which can be

capitilized on under the counterintelligence program and will rise

advise. Bureau under individual case captions along with

appropriate recommendations.
