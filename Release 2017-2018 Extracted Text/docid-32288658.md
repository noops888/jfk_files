ACCOUNTINE TO FRAUD SECTION MERLIN IS UNBLASSIMIED

100: Miami

Re Chicago airtel to Bureau, dated 2/12/64, and

Bureau airtel to Miami, dated 3/17/64, which communications

enclosed letterhead memorandums which were to be turned

over to Departmental Attorney ROBERT PELOQUIN.

So far as the Miami Office knows, PELOQUIN has

not been in Miami since 1/20/64, and the office of

departmental attorneys as well as the Miami USA's office

have no indication when he will return to the Miami area.

For this reason, It is suggested that Chicago letterhead

memorandums dated 2/12/64 and 3/13/64 be made available to

the Department through the Bureau since PELOQUIN allegedly

spends most of his time in the Department of Justice now.

Two coples of the above-mentioned letterhead memorandums

are enclosed for the Bureau.

Information coples are being sent to Chicago

and Denver,

and since PELOQUIN apparently spends most of

his time at the Department of Justice now, it is suggested

what the Chicago Office request the Bureau to turn over

oples of future letterhead memorandums to PELOQUIN.
