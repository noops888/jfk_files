An undercurrent of friction has recently developed between

AMICE/14 and ANTRUNK/3 which manifested itself in a fistfight on

29 March.

This was precipitated by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14

This in turn gives rise to the question whether AMICE/14,

with a

possible history of homosexual activity (see UFGA-8411), has made

The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27,

AMICE/14,

â€¢and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March

AMTRUNK/2,

1963 at Safesite #164

on Plantation Key..

Andrew S. PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from

headquarters,

was already at the training site when the team

was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS

and Hobart J. VANDEBORN. PARMERS remained

at the safesite

until 16 March during which time he conducted training in

clandestine. methods and techniques.

This training included

security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-

tions,

agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management,

and operational planning and reporting.

The training included

group discussion and participation in

a series of appropriate

operational situations, several problems,

and daily physical

training.

During this

two week period,

either PEGGINS or

VANDEBORN visited the safesite every

day, spending an average

of two or three hours with the group in operational dis-

cussions and processing.

During the week of 18 thru 23 March,

both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,

debriefing them in detail on

their operational contacts, workin

out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing

their training on an informal basis.

The week of

25 through

30 March was spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass

and map reading, including two night problems,

and on weapons

familiarization

and firing.

During the period under dis-

cussion the AMTRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED,

were assessed

by the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series

of immunizations, were issued

clothing, were processed for

allas documentation, were processed for disguises,

and were

further processed on cover and finance problems.

The re-

sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were sent to headquarters

under cover of UFGA-8111,

on 13 March 1963.

Based on DIR

1. AMTRUNK/2 is a (21)year old Cuban who is mature for his

years, and in some degree experienced in clandestine opera-

tions.

He attended Catholic Socialiniversity in Havana for

two years,

majoring in Social Studies

Prior to Fidel's

takeover A/2 was allied to student elements of the Partido

Autentico which upheld the constitution of 1940.

He supported

the revolution against Batista till it became apparent that

Castro had cast his lot for a Communist regime.

During his

university years from 1959 to 1961 he was actively engaged

in supporting anti-Castro groups with weapons and materials.

Following the Playa Giron invasiona great many in the Havana

underground were rolled up but A/2 avoided compromise.

He

continued

in this work through 1961 and finally left Cuba

via air in January 1962

Although A/2 does not consider

himself an ally of kUBArk he has been

cooperative throughout

judgement.

arranged signals will also be devised for use by the team via

telegram to indicate their progress and confirm their place

and time of exfiltration. Both members will also be given an

OWVL system to provide them with quick instructions in case

of an emergency.

F. OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION

1.

The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which

has considerable potential but also considerable risk.

The

area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruise missile

site and its accompanying radar. â€žIn addition boat patrols are

known to work this portion of the coast at frequent intervals.

Once infiltrated the team will not have to travel far before

to Guanabo or Havana and safehouse him.

This, however,

may

jeopardize the operation because A/3 lacks the maturity and

patience necessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi-

ness.

He may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under-

take a clandestine assignment on his own.

When A/2 and 3

step ashore in Cuba, control will vanish.

Fortunately A/2

has a sufficient resource of judgement to go about his busi

ness competently.

Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication.

For this reason an attempt will be made to steer A/3 towards

developing assets around his (lather's farm]vath maritime

reception capabilities.

COVER AND COMMUNICATIONS

AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 will live black during their entire stay

in Cuba.

They will be equipped with alias

documentation and

with disguises.

Both of them have previously lived in the

Havana area

and know the city well.

They will be trained in

Secret Writing (SW) and will plan to train at least two and

possible three agents in Havana in SW, prior to their own

exfiltration.

In addition, it is planned to train A/27 and

A/14 in OWVL. At the time of infiltration, exfiltration plans

will have been laid on with the agents.

In the event that a

change in time or location of exfiltration becomes necessary,

an OWVL message could be sent to the agents.

Any urgent

and

immediate message which might have to be sent by the

agents

during their short stay in Havana would be on a prearranged

open code system by commercial telegram.

Such a system will

be worked out to cover several possible

contingencies.

In-

ternal communications of whatever net is organized by A/27

and A/14 will be arranged by courier, cut-out, live and dead

drops.

F. OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION

1. The LCFLUTTER examinations on both AMICE 27 and AMICE 14

eke inconclusive.

Although it is the opinion of both the

case officers and the training personnel who have been i

highly

motivated and strongly anti-communist,

this point will

remain basically unresolved since it is almost certain that

A/27 would refuse a second LCFLUTTER examination if asked.

It is helieved that A/27 was withholding information curing

the LCELUTTER and subsequently.

The nature, seriousness, and

possible consequences of this are as yet not clear.

2. 1/27 has told at least two people something ahout this

operation

Although he says

that he did not give any details

of the operation, he does admit to having discussed it in

very general terms with two individuals whom he named at

the time of the LCFLUTTER test.

One of these is a friend

AMICE/27 has not seen his contacts in the army for the

past two years.

Although it is difficult to assess how well

he knows various persons in the military about whom he speaks,

officer's opinion that few of these contacts

might be considered really close.

AMICE/14 has been out of

direct touch with his operational contacts since July 1961.

4. The infiltration into Cayo Cinco Leguas is dependent

upon having a good guide in the boat.

At this time,

Phase

II is awaiting the recruitment of AMTRUNK/4 as guide.

Control over AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 is basically lacking.

Some control can be exerted through the implied threat of

withholding support to the operation.

Control however will

remain tenuous at best and A/27 will continue to be a dif-

ficult handling problem.

On the positive side of the ledger is the calibre of the

agents, both of whom are well educated, astute, and highly

V. FUTURE PLANS

Duringthe week of l through 6 April,

the team will receive

maritime instruction.

During the week 8 through 13 April,

they will receive SW training, possibly OWVL

training, dis-

guise training, and further operational planning sessions.

COMMITMENTS

1. According to AMICH/27. the following principle, which he

reces 1s a commitment

"ODYOKE will recognize a new Cubar

government which

is anti-Communist and which operates on

democratic principles;

ODYOKE does not desire to impose a

government of its own choice upon Cuba"..

A/27 has made

big point of discussing this "commitment".

It is apparent

that he intensely dislikes (or fears?) Batista and his

followers.

It is also apparent that

in his mind he links

Batista and. KUBARK, and fears that KUBARK would back Batis-

tianos in a post-Castro government.

2.

All AMTRUNK group members think that they received a

comm ment hiTe in ZRMPYAL that ODYOke would support their

operational plan, with funds,

training

, Logstcar support

and technical

assistance, but would leave control of the

operation entirely in

their hands

In other words i they

are not working for ODYOKE Or KUBARK in any sense.

On this

point they are

very sensitive.

Another commitment which AMICE/27 claims to have discussed

HiN"/"O in ZRMETAL is that ODYOKE should give "official recognition"

to members of a conspiracy which culminates in a successful

coup d'etat, following the coup, in order that these individual:

will

not be treated as political criminals by a future regime.

This means recognition of an individual's participation in

the conspiracy, not a promise of recognition of a specific

government formed by the conspirators themselves.

Discussion of the above "commitments" has been pressed

several times by A/27.

PEGGINS has not agreed to any of these

commitments with A/27. However, A/27 feels that the com-

mitments have already been made by ODYOKE in ZRMETAL.

PEGGINS

has told A/27 that he will report these

"commitments" back

to ODYOKE to determine 1f, in fact, ODYOKE considers them as

One further negative commitment has been discussed between

PEGGINS and A/27.

mitment will be made at this time to support any internal

group organized by the AMTRUNKS with weapons or explosives

and that this extends specifically to no promise to support

active sabotage with demolitions.
