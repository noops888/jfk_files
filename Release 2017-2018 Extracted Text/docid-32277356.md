MEMORANDUM

TO :

Secret Service File

FROM: Eileen Dinneen and Jim Conzelman

DATE: March 29, 1978.

RE:

Secret Service Index File and Commission Documents

United

States Archives

The materials found in the National Archives regarding Secret

Service investigations included

eight boxes of index cards and

nine boxes of documents and reports. The total number of index

cards was in excess of 5000.

These

cards included addresses,

phone numbers, P.O, boxes, and names of individual subjects.

The file boxes (9) encompassed, for the most part, Secret Service

Control Number reports with related correspondence.

All of these

materials were given

to the custody of the U.S. Archives by the

Secret Service as part of the JFK investigation.

I.

Secret Service Index Cards

A .

These cards were reviewed with specific attention being

paid to Cuban names, right wing activists, potential

threats against President Kennedy, possible Secret ser-

vice cover-up, and improved procedures in the protection

of the President.

A list was drawn up in reference to

the above.

Each card was then checked to locate the

attending report.

Due to the lack of a systematic filing

system, index cards prepared by the Secret Service could

not be

easily collated to the files.

Therefore, the

following cards which could not be located were

given to

Mike Lehy to cross

check against Archive files. (See

attachment A)

B.

It is understood that not all materials originally given

by the secret Service to the National Archives are still

in their custody.

Some documents have been returned.

It

is foreseen, therefore, that many of these files will have

to be reviewed at Secret Service Headquarters.

-Includes "protection while riding in vehicles"

(discusses

fact that motorcycles should NOT flank

Presidential car except in emergency.

- Pg. 56-7 "If great danger is suspected, the occupants

of buildings

facing parade routes should be checked

and a person of known reliability should be

given the

responsibility in

each location of assuring

that no

suspicious persons

are allowed at windows or on roof

tops in the danger

area." Note

"at windows or on

roof tops" is specifically stated.

This is contrary

to testimony given

by

several secret service agents.

-Discusses crowd and mob control, handling cranks.

an

attempt was made to assassinate

This is also in

contrast to tes-

timony given the warren Commission.

Agents stated

that ALL personnel are to stay with their man (JFK)

and thus no agents stayed behind in Dealey Plaza to

help with the investigation.

Secret

Service Protective Information Guidelines

1. The Secret Service addressed itself to the

following questions relating to Protection of

the President.

Q. Does the Secret Service draw on other

law

enforcement activities and other

assistance in protecting the President?

A. S.S. is now experimenting with the use of

other treasury law enforcement activities.

l. Could S.S. be assisted in its Presidential

protection operations by other federal law

enforcement agencies?

A. S.S. can envision occassions when assistance

of other Federal law enforcement agencies to the s.s.

would be beneficial. Also the Treasury

Department will be responsible for giving

a basic course in Presidential Protection.

I. Is the the risk too great to have both the

President and Vice President participate in

the same public function.

A.

How much risk

should be determined by s.s.

Q. What steps have the S.S. taken since November

22?

1. Liaison with other Federal, State and local

law and intelligence agencies.

2. Activities of the P.R.S. in identifying and

maintaining information on individuals who

are risks or potential risks to the life

of the President.

Box I--File Box

Page 13

l. What are the activities of P.R.S. in the develop-

ment of devises for protecting the President?

A. Checks or inspections of buildings--

S.S. has little funds for research and detective

devices.

President of Scientifics Advisory assisted the

Service in establishing contacts with several

commercial firms

and worked out plans for an

automatic data processing card file system.

Q. What criteria is employed in determining whether

to list individuals in the P.R.S. general files;

trip files; in the album?

A. Criteria in effect prior to Nov. 22, 1963, were

broad and general. If material was evaluated

as indicating some potential danger, it was

indexed in general P.R.S. files under the name

of the individual or group whom the material

related.

Individuals in "trip index file" are only those

evaluated as dangerous pending investigation, but

do not meet the requirements of hospitalization

or prosecution.

The album--a looseleaf booklet containing a

number of cellophane envelopes in which are

placed photographs and descriptions of subjects

who are considered dangerous.

Album is kept up-to-date.

I. Were all three files checked before the Texas trip?

A. "Trip index file" is same as

; "trip file"--contained

100 names.

It was checked prior to Dallas ard no

person was listed.

l. F.B.I. gave Dallas S.S. the name of a possible

dangerous person. Was it included in the "trip

angerous serablac

A.

Report had been submitted on him. Anti-Stevenson

pickets were identified and photos taken.

l. Is there formal or informal liaison with other agencies?

A.

Experienced FBI officers

assigned as liaison with

S.S.

Daily contact with White House detail.

l. Is there formal or informal instructions in protecting the

President in an emergency?

A. Cover the President as close as possible--shiela

him--remove him as quickly as possible.

In examining the Incoming Mail Log of the Warren Commission

it was found that on January 8, 1964 the Secret Service sent to

the Commission files relative to the assassination of President

Kennedy.

The files included the following:

40-199

200-407

408-472

474-559

561-759

Subsequent to January 8, 1964, the Warren Commission

received Secret Service files 341 and 511, and on January 24, 1964

received

the following files:

646, 648, 650, 656, 659, 661, 664,

675, 688

700, 701,

702,

703;

705,

707, 711: 715, 719, 724, 725, 736,

737, 743.

745, 746, 767, 949, 951.

It is interesting to note that the files received on

January 8, 1964 were supposed to be all-inclusive.

This casts

some doubt as to what files were actually received by the Warren

Commission.

The following are entries excised from the Warren Commission

Incoming Mail Log pertinent to the Secret Service.
