Edwin I. Willis, Charman of the House Committee

"on Un-American Activities,

during

the weekend of November 6, 1935, possibly in New Orleans.

During

chis meating Chalmers explained to Willis the story concerning Lee Oswal

involvement in some bonsings in Alabama.

You will recall that

Memorandum Baumgardner to Sullivan

HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES

KLAN INVESTIGATIONS

157-5

The source further advised that Robert Scoggins, Grand Dragon

for the State of South Carolina, had been notified by the Veterans

Administration that his disability pencion has been reduced. Shelton

feels that this was

retahatory measure taken by the Committee and the

Veterans Administration

against

Scoggins. Therefore, the Klan is

lodging a protest with the American Legion and the Disabled American

Veterans.

Shelton stated that when Raymond Anderson, the Grand Dragon

for the State of Tennessee, appears to testify before the Committee,

Shelton and members of the

press would accompany Anderson to

the Veterans

Administration to inquire ii Anderson's disability pension will also be

reduced.

It is noted that Anderson is a Bureau informant, who while

serving in the Armed forces during the Korean Conflict lost his ieft

arm.

This loss entitled him to a disability pension.

Observations:

Chairman Willis is being contacted by Assistant Director

DeLoach concerning the information furnished to him by Chalmers regarding

Oswald and to advise Willis that the information is not factual.

. It

appears that Shelton is circulating the story in order to possibly

discredit Venable, who he feels has furnished information to the

Committee concerning Shelton and Shelton's Klan

organization. Although

Venable did testify in executive session, a review of the testimony

indicates that he furnished little or no information of value, and

Shelton's assumption is erroneous

The infornation regarding shelton's proposed visit to the

Veterans Administration is known only to a limited number of individuals

including the source and Anderson, who is also a Bureau informant.

the event we advise the Veterans. Administration of this matter, it could

possibly result in the loss of two valuable sources since the Veterans

Administration may reveal that they had advance knowledge of this visit.

It is not believed that any real harm will be caused by this action on

the part of Shelton and, therefore, it is felt that the Veterans

Administration should not be advised.

We have-previously advised the White House and the Attorney

General regarding Willss? actions with regard to Sheriff Lowe.

ACTION:

For information.
