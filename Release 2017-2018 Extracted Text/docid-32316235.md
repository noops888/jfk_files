STEVE MAGADDINO, aka

(00 Buffalo)

DATE

FEB 24 1964

On 11/18/63, BU 280-C* advised that he had observed

STEVE MAGADDINO, JOHN

CAMMILLERI, PETER & MAGADDINO, and at

least one other man in conversation.

The following is a verbatim transcript of a portion

of the conversation which occurred at this time:

JOHN CAMMILLERI : "I brought him $1500 this morning.

There was the other guy with him

too."

PETER A. MAGADDINO: "Oh, that same guy.

He's from Internal

Revenue.

He's not FBI.

Where the hell

does he come

off to ask who you are

associated with?"

They are putting on a circus.

They are taking information without

any

basis for it.

That no good bum (this is

an apparent reference to JOSEPH VALACHI)

has named things and names of 35 years

3g0.

How can they accept this?

cuckola, VALACHI!"

CAMMILLERI subsequently departed remarking that he

would return in a few days and commenting that he does not

want to use the telephone.

Later on the same date, JOSEPH BONGIORNO was observed

with PETER A. MAGADDINO and the

subject. BONGIORNO indicated

that he was having trouble with his social security.

The

informant ascertained during this conversation that BONGIORNO

was born 9/6/16,

that his parents were GUSEPPI BONGIORNO and

CONSTANCE CAROTTO (ph), and that he has Social Security Number

101-03-8193.

It should be noted that in this discussion the subject

stated the correct spelling of BONGIORNO's mother's maiden

name was CAROTTO (ph) with two Is.

Copies of this letter

are being furnished to the

Bureau, Albany, and New York for information purposes and in

view of the conjectural relationship of the Assemblyman, JOSEPH

CARLINO.

It is emphasized that this identification is

coniectural.
