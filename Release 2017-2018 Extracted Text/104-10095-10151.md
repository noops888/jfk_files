Introduction: After examining the evidence of Nosenko's mala

fides in the notebook, which I

assume to

be the best evidence,

although not all of 1t, I am convinced that Nosenko 1s a bona fide

•defector. I believe the case against him has arisen and persisted

because the facts have been misconstrued, Ignored, or interpreted

without sufficient consideration of his psychological fallings.

recommend that the case be reviewed

by a new team of CIA officers.

1. There are several references in the Nosenko notebook to the ex

tent and quality of the intelligence he provided.. In the 25 March

1964

memo to DDP, it is asserted that "A comparison of his positive

Intelligence with that of other Soviet Bloe intelligence officers

with whom we have had an operational relationship shows that all of.

them

were consistently better able to

provide useful positive Intelll-

gence than has been Nosenko." Tab D of this same memo states

"His

positive Intelligence production is practically nil," and later:

"viewed overall, however, NOSENKO's positive Intelligence production

has been so meager for a

man of his background, training and position

88

to cast doubts on his bona fides, without reference to other

criteria." All of these statements are incorrect.

2. There are three persons in the Clandestine Service with the

background and experience to make this judgment None was consulted

regarding these evaluations of Nosenko's production and access. All

agree that they are incorrect. No KGB officer has been able to

provide more useful Intelligence than Nosenko has; intelligence

usefulness of all KGB officers (perhaps all CI officers) is

"practically nil". Golitsyn's was nil. This is apt to be par-

ticularly true 1f a requirements officer is not directly supporting

the case officer, as was true in the Nosenko case. Viewed in the

proper context, therefore, Nosenko's intelligence production cannot

be used in his defense, but neither can it be said honestly to cast

any doubt whatsoever on his bona fides, and the judgment regarding

his bona fides must therefore be made on the basis of his counter-

Intelligence information:

3.

Before commenting on the counterintelligence case against

him, I

feel there are some aspects of his personality analysis by the

psychiatrist which have a much

stronger bearing on the case than Is

apparent in the notebook. The psychologist's report is only mentioned

in passing in the notebook, but it too may shed light on the validity

of evaluations of Nosenko's counterintelligence information which

bear on his

bona fides. The psychiatrist is indirectly quoted

(presumably only in part) in the 1l May 1964 status

report as follows:

"NOSENKO shows significant indications of a serious personality dis-

order." "The sociopathic aspect of his character apparently explains

his inattention to 'objective fact'..." Once these conclusions

are reached by competent authority, the interrogator and CI analyst

are out of their elements.. It is hardly likely that a person with

a serious personality disorder, inattentive to objective fact, will

be able to provide the sort of substantial information which would

Inspire faith in him. Neither is it conceivable that he would be

itinent

selected by the KGB to carry out even one of the several vital

missions which he is alleged to be on in the West. The substantive

evidence that he is not on any mission is given below.

4. The March 1964 memo to DDP concludes that "Those of us who

have worked with

Nosenko cannot accept that he is other than a KGB

plant." This statement is also incorrect. The only officer who

worked with Nosenko who has any depth of experience with Soviet

agents--Kisevalter--does not accept this. No doubt the psychologist.

and psychiatrist who worked with hin would also dissent. Who, then,

accepts this insidious conclusion? Only one of the officers who.

worked with Nosenko had any prior

experience with one of our Soviet

agents, and that was not In the field of counterintelligence. None

•' of the officers was experienced in counterintelligence agalast the

k: USSR. The Inttial judguent that Nosenko was a plant was made by the

officer with the least Soviet experience, a bare two weeks after the

initial

contact with Nosenko, on the basis of "careful comparison of

NOSENKO's infornation with that provided by Anatolly Golitsyn...

This is an incredible conjunction of inexperienced personnel and

crucial decision.

5. There are three nost important items of information in

Nosenko's 1962 revelations

to us. Only two are discussed in the

notebook, so I shall begin my

comments on his CI information with

the one which was omitted from discussion:

---

## Page 4

A. Boris Belitskiy - Nosenko told us that this Soviet agent of

ours had been under Soviet control since our recruitment of him.

This was startling news to most persons who had worked on this case.

We recruited Belitskly in 1958 and held our second series of meetings

with him in London in August 1961. At that time I worked very closely

with the case officer and polygraph operator in order to assess

Blitskiy's bona fides, which had come under suspicion at Headquarters.

Upon our return from London, during discussion of the latest Penkovskiy

meetings, CSR Inforned DDP that Belitskly was considered bona fide

by evèryone but me. Belltskly came out to the U.S. in 1962, several

months after Nosenko compromised him, but he has not come out since

Nosenko's defection. It is inconceivable that che

Soviets would

build up Belitskly, get him past the polygraph, and then compromise

hin. As I pointed out in my October 1964 paper on Soviet disinforma-

tion cases, Belitskiy was the first such sophisticated case run against

us, and would hardly be sacrificed needlessly just when it was ready

to bear fruft for the soviets.

B. ANDREY - Nosenko stated that this was the most important U.S.

penetration he had heard of in his entire career. The analysis of

this case in the notebook is very strange, to say the least. The co-

parison of

Nosenko's information with Golitsyn's shows very clearly

that Nosenko's information was remarkably accurate and Golitsya's

was entirely misleading! Golitsyn is said in the notebook to have

been desk officer for two years on this case! Nosenko stated quite

correctly that this agent was a cipher machine mechanic recruited

in Moscow in 1949-50 and that he left Moscow in 1950; his informa-

tion that Kovshuk (alias KOMAROV) had gone to Washington to recontact

him in 1955-56 may or may not be true, but it gave the additional clue

that Kovshuk traveled alias ROMAROV. It is really surprising that

this much information did not lead CI analysts to the agent; the only

fact that Golitsyn added to Nosenko's Information is that the agent

was located in Atlantic CIty.

The

notebook analysis. concludes that there was an agent being

hidden by Nosenko's information, although most of the evidence given

for this is from Nosenko. The opposite conclusion should be reached

by objective analysis

of Nosenko's statements.: Nosenko calls the

agent

ANDREY

and Golltsyn calls him JACK. Obviously, the Soviets

had two agents and we have found only one so far: even the notebook

analysis agrees. Nosenko had no need-to-know on either of these two

cases, and it appears that both Nosenko and Golitsyn have mixed them

up because of similarities in the cases. Nosenko's confused version,

although less confused than Golitsyn's, is much more important than

Golitsyn's,

because Nosenko states categorically that as of 1962 thè

Soviet agent "working in the Pentagon at that time provided valuable

Information on ciphei machines

and related matters." Instead of

hiding an agent, Nosenko is giving information on the agents, one of

whom is at large right now! Golitsyn indirectly gave the opinion

that the

Soviets still have a code clerk in place when he disagreed

with Nosenko about a recruitment attempt in Moscow, but this may be

only a dispute about the recruitment time, not the fact.

S20.31

## Page 6

Nosenko's conclusive evidence that there were two cases is his

identification of Kovshuk as Komarov, which made it possible for us

to check visa lists

and determine that "Komarov" visited Washington

in 1957.

Golitsyn's JACK, on the other hand, confessed that the

Soviet had recontacted him in 1955. Although Golitsyn did not know

specifically why Rovshuk went to Washington, or his allas, he

identified "Komarov's" photo as Kovshuk. The recontact TDY officer

in Golitsyn's story was Yurly Novikov; the notebook does not indicate

whether Novikov did come to Washington In 1955.

• Nosenko was wrong in one respect--he thought he was identifying

one important U.S. penetration, but he actually was telling us about

two! No more time should be wasted in the search for this soviet

agent.

C. Surveillance -- The March 1964 DDP memo states that "Nosenko"s

principal message to us in 1962 and again in 1964 was that the loss

of several of our most productive sources in the years 1958 through

1962 was

solely the result of a comprehensive and technically ad

vanced systen of surveillance in Moscow." Presumably this

means

the loss of Popov in early 1959 (Nosenko 1962) and Penkovskly in late

1962 (Nosenko 19643). In my opinion this "message" is not nearly as

Important as messages A and B above, although it is important.

Although all available sources in our experience testify to the

efficacy of Soviet surveillance in Moscow, with special emphasis on

Penkovskly, the

notebook chooses

to take issue with this Nosenko

information. However, no evidence is presented to prove Nosenko

wrOng.

The only argument attempted consists of a grave insinuation

about an American citizen and CIA employee, Winters, which was later

checked and found to be without foundation. The analysis asserts

that the Soviet intelligence documents provided by KGB officer

Cherepanov in late 1963 support Nosenko's information about sur-

veillance of Popov.

However, Instead of reaching the logical and

normal conclusion that these two sources confirm one another, the

notebook reaches the opposite conclusion--because they support one

another, they are both suspect.

If we have no evidence, as is the case here, what grounds are

there for contradicting Nosenko? Presumably the same as those for

suspecting Winters., If we are proceeding on intuition at this point,

It has more than a touch

of genuine paranoia in it.

6. Much is made throughout the notebook about inconsistencies

and discrepancies in Nosenko's information..

This is very important.

However, before an experienced interrogator reaches significant

conclusions about an agent's bona fides, he must weigh all of the

psychological factors involved. By the time Nosenko's inexperienced

Interrogators were finished with him, they were of course experienced,

but by

that time they were also heavily committed to condemning

Nosenko, and the details which they were covering were already so

trivial, antique, or repetitive. that no useful results could be

expected. In any agent operation, the case officer must be an

amateur psychologist, but in dealing with a complex defector,

particularly when a professional diagnosis has been made, the

---

## Page 8

turned.

8

amateur must step aside.

7. There are several phases of psychological. steps which the

Nosenko operation

must be divided into. There is no direct relation-

ship between them, and it is fruitless to compare information from

them

The only thread through all of then is the psychiatrist's

assertion that he has a disturbed personality inattentive to objective

fact.. These primary phases are 1962 meetings, 1964 meetings, and

post-defection meetings. The character of the 1962 meeting is

conditioned by whatever motivated him to make contact; the informa

tion he provided is probably couched in terms of his determination

to get what he could out of us, but he was not then thinking In terms

of a relationship which would make it possible for us to see through

his exaggerated self-importance. The 1964 meetings probably still

had some of this attitude behind

them, but the positive and negative

ramifications of the contact had been

fomenting in his disturbed mind

for over a year and a half, and the factors which led him to actually

make the break would probably have disturbed the content and clarity

of his Infornation as well. Once he had defected, the disturbed

elements of his personality probably were at a crisis level, as he

had added the need to

compensate for committing treason and to

establish himself in an alien

environment; he had not only to rebuild

his entire life, but his self-respect, ethics, and other aspects of

his disturbed personality. When one adds to this the psychiatrist's

findings that he is "brutally egotistic", "with no concern for the

feelings and interests of others", "undisciplined, narcissistic,

and exhibitionistic," it becomes starkly clear that this is not an

---

## Page 9

individual whose information can be

judged by routine standards.

8. Throughout the notebook there is reference to our capability

• to check on Nosenko's information. It is stated that there has been

an "enormous flow to the West

of detailed information on the Soviet

Intelligence and security services

which resulted from the numerous

defections to

the West of Soviet intelligence officers and the

successful penetrations of the Soviet Intelligence since 1954."

The March 1964 DDP memo

goes so far as to say that "the West acquired

so much information on KGB personnel, organization and modus

operandi

that there. was very little which the KGB would not consider cói-

promised in some way.." While it is true that we have had some

good defectors in the past, the latter statement strains credulity.

If we examine the KGB sources available to us who could have provided

such information, we find that there were several up to 1955 and then

none until December 1961. Since Popov and Penkovskiy were CRU

officers, they had little detail to contribute on the KGB; Goleniewski

was Polish, so his real knowledge of the KGB was accordingly and under-

standably limited. Therefore, as of January 1962, when Golitsyn

reluctantly began to give us information, our enormous "f10% of

Information" on the KGB had been interrupted since 1955; and by far

the larger part of it was at least eight years old, as it had come

from Rastvorov and Deryabin. Since Deryabin had left Moscow in

September 1953, and Rastvorov In July 1950, our best stock of KGB

Info predated late 1953. Therefore, to say that the KGB would •

consider almost all of its organization, personnel, and modus

operandi

compromised to the West from January 1934 up to "Penkovskiy's arrest

In October 1962", is a considerablé exaggeration. A more balanced

statement

is made in the DCI memo of 9 September 1965, which limits

the "enormous" reference to 1954. The only defector or agent who

might have been in position to provide us any volume of information

on these subjects from 1954 to 1962 was Golitsyn himself. A better

Indication of the state of our knowledge on these subjects is

suggested in the March 1964 DDP meno in the form of a critician of

Nosenko's performance:

...but he has brought out

not a fraction of

what would have been easily available to him on such subjects as KGB

table of organization, which he knew from 1962 to be of interest to

F. us..." It Is very unlikely that the KGB would equate our 1954 fund

of infornation with Nosenko's 1964 knowledge; the genuinely relevant

question 1s whether they would equate Golitsyn's knowledge with

Nosenko's, and that is discussed below. In fact, the March 1964 mèmo

later contradicts itself on this point, stating that before

the

Nosenko defection, we had no contact with KGB officials.over many

years.

9. . It is not easy to compare Nosenko's Information with

Golitsyn's because the latter broke off contact with us before he was

fully debriefed, but the comparison made in the notebook should be valid

to the extent that the two men reported on the same subject matter.

Most of Colitsyn's service in the KGB was spent in school. His

actual intelligence experience consisted of two years on the

field, since August 1955, has been as NATO

Reports Officer from September 1959 to April 1960, and CI officer

on the American desk from that time through his tour in Finland

and defection in December 1961. He left Moscow PCS in August 1960.

His significant information dates

primarily from his service as a

reports officer. Nosenko, on the other hand, is unique as a source

of information on the KGB., His entire 12 years in the KGß has been

Most of this time he was a CI officer working against tourists,

Information on KGB Headquarters is almost four years later than

Golitsyn's, and should be correspondingly better.

• 10. A number of assumptions are made in the notebook about

"that specific area of knowledge which NOSENKO

should have possessed

if he had occupied the particular KGB. positions at the particular

times he claimed." As outlined in the paragraph above, our insight

which would even theoretically

permit such assumptions is dated 1954

at best. Does this give us firm grounds for reaching reliable con-

clusions about the access afforded by a KGB position? The most

difficult problem for analysts in the Soviet sphere is to translate

themselves into the Soviet environment. Outside

the Clandestine

Service it is rare to meet an analyst with a realistic concept of

the USSR; most of them go

on the assumption that American analogies

12

are applicable to the Soviet scene. From our own operational

experience we have learned to be quite wary of assuming knowledge

of specific aspects of the Soviet target.

Since our basis for

making assumptions about Nosenko's job is ten years old, that would

suggest that Deryabin or Rastvorov would be as competent as any of

us to judge Nosenko. However Deryabin betrayed his prejudice when he

made the snap judgment that Nosenko was "phony" after he had been

"briefed on the mere facts of the Nosenko case..." Such horseback.

judgments do not inspire confidence; Deryabin's competence

judgment of Nosenko lis further

analyzed below.

Another example

of faulty projection into the Soviet situation

in the notebook concerns

the $250, 1n operational funds which Nosenko

misappropriated in Geneva in 1962. In the March 1964 memo it 1s

stated that the amount of money was "only about!$250 and he could

certainly have made up this deficit through either of two close

friends (another is added elsewhere) who were present in Geneva at the

tIme..." Aside from

the fact that the notebook tries to prove

elsewhere that neither of these persons was really a close friend,

the weakness in this assumption 1s obvious. As the March 1964 memo

states, "loss of ops funds is a terrible offense in Sovit eyes..."

Does any of us consider $250 to be a paltry sun?

If we had misappro-

priated such a sum would we want our best friends or superiors to

know about it? Even in an emergency, most of us would probably go

to extremes to avoid embarrassing a friend by such a request, or

exposing our weaknesses

to a friend. However, the psychiatrist has

already given us evidence that Nosenko was not the kind of person

---

## Page 13

14-00000

13

who makes friends, so the notebook is probably correct in its

alternate finding that the persons

In Geneva were not friends in

the best sense of the word (the money-lending sense). Nosenko had

no place. to turn,, particularly when one adds his

need to indulge

himself, which has been confirmed by the psychlatrist,. Golltsyn, our

own experience with him, our knowledge of Soviet VIP sons, and his

own admission. Our ignorance of the specific background is another

factor in weighing the significance of the ops funds vulnerability

question. How many times had Nosenko misappropriated funds

previously?

How had he made up the deficit before? What would be the rationaliza-

tion of the situation in the case of a disturbed personality such as

k: h18?

Throughout the memos and other documents in the notebook there

1s a stream of consciousness discussion of Nosenko's career, first

providing evidence and conclusions that he had certain positions,

later evidence and conclusions that he did not, and so forth. This

uncertainty even goes so far as to suggest, even to

conclude, that

Nosenko is not even Nosenko! Gradually, the case was built up again

that he is in fact Nosenko. There are several ways to read this

confusion, but the psychiatrist's findings show the path"

to the

correct understanding of it. It is very difficult to deal effectively

with a disturbed personality, and it is not surprising that the SR

people working with him found him confusing. However, Golitsyn

confirmed that Nosenko worked where he said he did; even that he was

a "skirt-chaser", many of his agents confirmed

his employment in the

---

## Page 14

14

KGB, and Artamonov could have confirmed that he was Nosenko if he

had been asked to do so. The inability of our personnel to see the

facts through Nosenko's stories which were "inattentive to objective

fact" is not necessarily a reflection on them, but neither can it be

used with confidence to support serious accusations against Nosenko.

The evaluation of an agent on personality or "eyeball-to-eyeball"

grounds is extrenely precarious. In fact, the one Nosenko

Interrogator with Soviet agent experience was involved during the

same time period with just such a judgment on another agent, in which

he, and another of our best and most experienced case officers, as

well as the polygraph, proved to be absolutely wrong in their

assessment of the agent. Many of our Soviet agents and defectors

have been unbalanced. This observation applies to Penkovskiy, 1t

applies to Nosenko, and it applies to Golitsyn, and to Krotkov; •

Deryabin's long siege with alcoholism shows that he was not entirely

exempt.. Treason is indeed a grave decision, even if committed 1n

steps, as Nosenko did it, and the defector does not become 100 percent

American and O percent Soviet when he crosses the border.

The ultimate conclusions about Nosenko's bona fides, as the

notebook indicates, must be based on his production--how much did

he hurt the Soviets.

The evidence shows that he has damaged the

Soviet

intelligence effort more than all the other KGB defectors

combined. The specific elements of this damage are as follows:

A. Belltskly--The evidence is stated above; this was the pinnacle

of the Soviet disinformation achievement. Once Nosenko had com

promised it, as I pointed out in my October 1964 paper, all other

---

## Page 15

15

similar agents are unmasked.

B. ANDREY-JACK--Although Nosenko's information was precise on one

of these two agents, and Golitsyn's was largely incorrect, Golitsyn

1s inexplicably given the credit for our discovering the agent. This

agent was no longer active, but this is small consolation, as he had

been a cipher machine mechanic, and details of cipher machines have

value well beyond their date of manufacture:

More important, Nosenko assures us that another agent is still

providing the Soviets such information. All the wrong data Golitsyn

provided may actually apply to the agent who has not been apprehended.

C. Vassall--Nosenko is given credit for the apprehension of Vassall-

this alone is sufficient to establish his bona fides. Information on

Western naval matters; particularly Polaris submarines, is undoubtedly

top priority for Soviet intelligence. It is completely out of the

question that a source with any potential for reporting on this

subject would be terminated

even an hour before he had to be. The

only substantial clue that Golitsyn gave us on Vassall was that

British Admiralty documents were being received in the KGB Reports

Office in 1959. It is not surprising that CI officers did not dis-

cover Vassall on this slim lead, since it could have beeh assumed

that the documents came from the Lonsdale-Cohen-Houghton net con-

promised by Goleniewski. It borders

on fantasy to teach the con-

clusion that the Soviets would compromise Vassall to us over 6 months

after Golitsyn defected on the assumption that Golitsyn had com

promised him. In fact, it is fantastic!

---

## Page 16

16

D. Johnson--Nosenko is quite right in asserting that this is one of

the best leads he gave us.

If it were not for him, this agent would

still be operating against

us. The memo to the FBI makes a strenuous

effort to demonstrate that this was a troublesome case

for the KGB

and that there were security weaknesses in it. That is the kind

of trouble we would love to have--this agent had access to some

of

the highest-level infornation avallable In NATO, which 1s to say,

U.S. plans for war in Europe. His rank, experience, clearances, and

tradecraft ability qualify him as the best possible type of agent.

The KGB undoubtedly had great hopes for his future access.. If the

complication of his wife's disturbed personality had constituted a

genuine threat to the operation, the Soviets probably would have

arranged for her to have an "accident". They may well have con-

sidered this and concluded that she was a valuable component of

Johnson's motivation. The only straightforward reason that the

memo to FBI gives for the Soviet willingness to compromise this

operation apparently is Soviet fear of its being blown to the

French. Isn't this pretty weak?

Of course. Nosenko's knowledge

of this case is questioned on the grounds that it is a violation

of the "usually effective KGB security compartmentation", yet we

have said earlier that most of Golitsyn's valuable information

consisted of things he "had

no right to know".

E. The KGB--The March 1964 memo states that "Nosenko's production

has been most useful in those areas which the KGB must consider

already compromised (KGB organization, general methods and

---

## Page 17

k.

17

techniques, Headquarters personnel) or expendable (names of per-

sonnel who do not work abroad, etc.)..." After considering the

five cases cited above, It is impossible to agree with this. This

sentence is also contradicted by the facts given above on the unique

nature of his access and the paucity of rellable information on the

KGB since 1954, excepting Golitsyn, who served in an entirely different

directorate from Nosenko. In fact the memo states that Nosenko's

Information on his directorate was far more detailed than Golitsyn's,

and most of the 240 names he gave us were previously not known to us.

To assume that the KGB would consider Nosenko's information com-

promised 1s to find them unaware of their own defectors or grossly

wrong

about our knowledge of the RGB. The criticism that he does

not know (or remember) enough about CIA personnel in Moscow in-

corporates another large assumption; perhaps we have made some

progress in concealing our people from the RGB. They may make erfors

in Identifying AIS officers just as we do on the RIS.

F. Foreign agents--No Soviet defector has identified as many Soviet

agents as Nosenko. He identified 73 past, present, or developmental

American agents

and 97 foreigners in the same categories. The arguments

employed in the memo/deprecate Nosenko's list of agents do not provide

evidence that he was wrong or that it is incomplete, but lean heavily

on the fact that we knew

most of them or that they are not important.

Thank God for something. However, the fact that we may have known

or suspected most of them is irrelevant, particularly when our basis

for suspicion was derogatory information. If this were used as a

thousand more persons could quality.. The significant eister in

evaluating these agents is whether the Soviets knew thas it tere

already aware of these agents. The next logical step 14 4y juage

whether the Soviets would be willing to give them all up.

Fine way

of looking at this aspect is to assume that they are our arrats fn

the USSR, rather than theirs in the west, and then calculaty bow

many of then we would be willing to compronise to the serviets. Out

of the 170 on our list, I doubt

that we would surrender work than

half a dozen. Unless they are going out of business, neither would

the soviets. On the basis of the table in the memo, there 12

evidence to indicate that only about 15 of 170 were CerEaLalY knOWI

by the RGB to be compromised

to us.' The old argument, chat colitsyn

said It first, 1s repeated in the memo in respect to Nostren's 1962

Information: "There was a remarkable correlation between ise two,

sources, giving the distinct impression that NOSENKO Was a LacK

reporting from the KGB's damage assessment on GOLIISYN'* lklection."

The same claim 1s not made about the

list of agents whirt bosenko

provided, as only 8 of the 170 were confirmed by Golitsya"e Informa-

tion. If the correlation of Golitsyn's information with

1962 info can be judged remarkable, it is only in the sit

that

Nosenko reported useful details correctly while Golitsyn in kon-

sistently wrong. This is understandable, since most of ik 16

points of information

fall into the category of things 1i.1tzya

"had no right to know", and which therefore probably would hit

appear in the damage report after his defection!

G. Microphones In U.S. Embassy--Of the 3 points of the 18 on which

Golitsyn provides better or contradictory information, one concerned

Golitsyn's desk directly and was logical for him to know. The other

two concern bugs and SIGINT equipment in the American Embassy.

The

major contradiction deals with bugs, Nosenko stating that the new

wing had none and Golitsyn stating that a lot of money had been

spent arranging audio coverage of the new wing. Examined carefully,

these statements are not contradictory. Lots of plans end up in the

trash. Golitsyn goes on to say that Embassy bugs were still active.

in 1961. It is clear that this statement does not refer specifically

to the new wing, which was built in 1960-61, and not occupled until

1962. Although Nosenko was the third source to identify a microphone

in the minister-counsellor's office, it was his specific information

on locations of numerous

other mikes which ultimately led

to. the

discovery of the large number of mikes in the Embassy. Once again,

his was the information which was critical to out

security, but he

does not get the credit. In fact, once he had given us the key data,

all other embassies in Moscow with which we are frlendly could use

our experience to detect mikes in their embassies, thereby denying

the Soviets additional intelligence. The Soviets would hardly

sacrifice all this! Although we found a few more microphones than

we knew of, they were all compromised as soon as we found the first

cable and followed it

around the building. Nosenko stated that

there were no mikes in the renovated north wing, and he was right.

Whatever we found in that wing resulted from his information.

Nosenko's service in the American Embassy section from 1960-62

should have made him knowledgeable at least of CI aspects of this

subject. The mikes were not the responsibility of his section,

nor waS

the intelligence produced. So far as the entire 18 points

go, Nosenko's information is unquestionably more complete and

accurate in the main.

The Cherepanov papers, delivered to the American Embassy in

November 1963, are said to support Nosenko's story of his career.

and he vouches for then. Logically, they are

both valid, but this

is not accepted. Along with considerable nuendo and insinuation,

the March 1964 DDP memo calls the papers the "Winters Papers".

Since Winters

was examined and cleared after this memo was written,

the arguments against the validity of these papers lose cohesion,

at least, and

should be redrafted if they are to make any sense at

all (if not for sake of decency). The only other serious argument

given against the papers relates to KGB resources for writing and

handling documents. Since only Nosenko and Golitsyn are accessible

and knowledgeable on such procedures in the modern KGB, Golitsyn's

comments would be appropriate, but the comments used presumably are

10 years old, from Deryabin. The conclusion that the papers are of

no value to us is irrelevant, as long as the individual tho gave

them to us thought they were and belleved he was hurting the Soviets

by handing them over. Penkovskiy's views on the value of what he

gave us were often inconsistent with our own. Whatever Nosenko

told us, we could

not, and did not, pretend to know the identity

of every Soviet agent in any country, including the United

States.

## Page 21

His position in the Counterintelligence (Second) Directorate of the

KGB certainly would not afford him

such access, since the primary

Intelligence effort of the KGB is in the Intelligence (First)

Directorate for which Golitsyn worked. The aspect which Nosenko

could observe as the narrow one of Moscow, with an occasional .

Incidental, illegal insight through the compartmentation system,

which Golitsyn demonstrated to be rather leaky.

Krotkov, the agent of Nosenko's directorate who defected in

London in September 1963, has little bearing on the Nosenko case

but is mentioned here because it is cited as evidence against

Nosenko, although it also supports Nosenko to

some extent. There

appears to

be good reason to believe, as Nosenko said, that Krotkov

WAS

a "Iittle crazy". The book which krotkow wrote gives evidence

of personality disturbance, and the hypertension from which he

suffers could not be faked, but could well be organic evidence of

mental imbalance. The approach of the KGB officer, Lysov, to the FBI

in September 1962 also lacks conviction as circumstantial evidence

against Nosenko. If a KGB officer were in financial straits

Involving mishandling of ops funds, the actions of Nosenko and

Lysov presumably are characteristic of the primary steps he would

take to extricate himself. There may be an operational suggestion

here for us, as well as a warning which is echoed in the Dunlap,

Johnson, and Whalen cases. Another question is posed in the memo

concerning the Soviets whom Nosenko has recommended to us for

recruitment, particularly V.P. Suslov. There is an

obvious answer

---

## Page 22

14-00000

22

to this question, however and that is'to recruit Suslov.

The

objection that this may be a provocation by the Soviets is not

valid, since we are already running a Soviet disinformation agent

in the UN.

The point is made and emphasized in the notebook that the KGB

Disinformation Department was formed in 1959.. This is a very mis-

leading fact. As Rastvorov and Golitsyn have reported, there was a

Disinformation Service in the KI, and Golitsyn confirmed that the

function .continued after the KI dissolved in 1951, although there was

no separate element for 1t. Most of the Soviet disinformation agents

known to us were run against us before 1959, and the most sophisticated

ones, Belltskly, LEbACRON,: and probably lAgeLOO, weze concelved and

executed before 1959. The establishment of a separate Disinforma-

tion Department, therefore, appears to have followed the heyday of

the disinformation operation, rather than preceded it.. Certainly s

new operations

have been conceived since, such as AFTYPHOON in

and [ABELASK In

and probably others, as indicated by our memos

to CSR on ATPARING and LAMINUS, but the days of the disinformation

agent probably have been numbered since Nosenko's exposure of

Belitskly.

There are a number of references in the case against Nosenko

to unidentified "knowledgeable sources" who are quoted making

damaging assessments of Nosenko. It is apparent from most such

references that the knowledgeable sources meant are Deryabin and

Rastvorov. However, neither of these two KGB officers can genuinely

---

## Page 23

be said to have knowledge of the KGB which is applicable to the

Nosenko case, since one left Moscow In 1950 and the other in 1954-

The

most serious assumption affecting Nosenko's assessment are

those which Involve his production. The argument agalast him falls

apart completely without the continuous application of the assumption

that he has told us only what the Soviets knew was already in our

hands. This

assumption, in turn, rests entirely on our estimate of

the damage assessment which the Soviets probably wrote on Golftsyn.

This

Is where the argument loses all of its

force. We have no basis

whatsoever for making a rellable Itemization of the things which are

Included in the KGB damage assessment except for the documents which

Golitsyn brought with him. We can guess that the list includes the

gist of all documents which Golitsyn saw while in Finland for the 17

months before he defected. It would be impossible for the Soviets to

say precisely what Golitsyn remembered of KGB organization, personnel,

and activities since he had left Moscow. It would be absolutely

Impossible for the Soviets to know what Golitsyn had learned illegally

by word of mouth, either while he was in Moscow or after he had gone.

to Helsinki. The March 1964 DDP memo stated

that Golitsyn learned

many details

about sensitive operations. "which he had no right to

know" In this

way.

Just as it would be impossible for us to make a

parallel itemization on a CIA officer, even with the complete honesty

of all persons who knew hlш..]

The most serious part of the KGB damage

assessment probably would have related to Golitsyn's service as a

reports officer on the NATO desk. From what he has told us, ft fg

apparent that he did not know the names of most of the agents whose

## Page 24

•24

reports he handled. He was able to describe subject matter and had

managed to pick up some other operational details, many of them

wrong, as in the ANDREY-JACK cases.. While the KGB would probably try

to minimize the damage assessment in their report to higher authorlty,

they would probably maximize it among themselves, but it defies logic

to conclude that they would send us an agent who would be able to

provide the details which would lead to compromise of producing assets:

Neither would we. We would move very carefully operationally, or even

stand down on cases where we thought there

was danger of

compromise,

but if our agents survived for a few weeks, or even months, we would

conclude that the storm was past. And the KGB is probably considerably

more coldblooded than we are when it comes to collecting intelli

gence even in the face of perils to their agents. Nosenko summed

it up accurately when he said that the KGB "would not really know the

extent of my knowledge," "It will take many months to look into

these matters, so nothing will change for a long time," and when

discussing a case:. "they won't have any way of knowing I know. Cer-

tainly the people who told me won't volunteer the fact." The problem

of the damage assessment, here of there, could not be stated better.

Since Deryabin was employed in the Personnel Directorate, he would

normally know and remember more about personnel forms

procedures

than would operational personnel. The latter generally consider all

forms and procedures

a nuisance and spend as little time and thought

on them as

possible. If organizational

errors are to be used

against

Nosenko, they can also be used against Rastvorov, as he was one year

off on both the formation and dissolution of the KI and,. just as

---

## Page 25

25

Nosenko did, left out the GULAG and other extraneous units when

drawing up the organization of

the KGB, although he had only been

away from the Center four years when he defected.

The evidence

which Deryabin uses to support his assertion that he can deny the

truthfulness of varfous aspects of Nosenko's story consists of the

kind of trivia on which few persons could score well.. Since

Deryabin was engaged In actual Intelligence work for less than two

years

before his defection In February 1954, and had been in the fleld

for the six months just prior to his defection, his tests of Nosenko

Involve facts

at least 11 years old. They are falily fresh to

Deryabin's mind because they relate to his last experience in the

USSR, but Nosenko's considerably greater depth of experience

naturally has placed so nany layers of information over the 1952-53

era that he could not reasonably be expected to recall the

things

that Deryabin can. This would become clear if we were to have a

current CIA CI officer debriefed on the same period in CIA by a

former CIA FI employee who resigned In 1953.

It has also become clear in a hurried comparison of Deryabin's

original reports with his present criticisms of Nosenko. • For

example, one of Deryabin's trivial points 1s that Nosenko claims

his working hours to have begun at 1030; Deryabin agrees with the

other details Nosenko gave on working hours but insists that 1000

was the starting time.

Rastvorov confirms in his reports that

Nosenko is correct; Deryabin's own reports in 1954 stated that the

working hours were 1100-2100, although he now agrees with Nosenko

that 2400 was closing time. Considerably more interesting 1s

Deryabin's accusation that Nosenko made an "outright mistake" t?

asserting that there was a tenth directorate of the KGB In 195344

which was called

the Directorate of the Kremlin Commandant.

Deryabin assures us in his

criticisn of Nosenko that "This

directorate had actually merged with the Guards. Directorate In

1947, and the combined directorate was designated the 9th DIrectifate

In 1952 (and has remained so to this day)." However, Deryablu..

his 1954 debriefings. Deryabin thus disqualifies himself as a

knowledgeable and objective examiner of Nosenko. With all the sa

Deryabin spent in the Guards Directorate, this is a point one

expect him to remember. These contradictions, and others which

would probably turn up in

a careful examination of the rest of

Deryabin's case against Nosenko, are In the area of Deryabin's

-established in 1942, this was the concept, but it soon deteriorated,

and almost all Soviet internal military mall after the war contains

both the FPN number and the place name.

If Deryabin really knew

the Soviet FPN system, he would have been able to say that the FPN's

were assigned in blocks at first, and that the 901XX block from which

Nosenko's FPN In 'Sovetskaya Gavan was taken was in a naval block. If

he had this real knowledge, he could then say that military intelll-

gence FPN's conmonly contained

a zero as one of the five digits.

He

could then have concluded that the number Nosenko gave was in fact a

naval Intelligence unit... It Is admittedly somewhat easier for us to

make such an analysis, as we know fron an Incontrovertible

source

that the FPN Nosenko gave

the tourist ops document which Golitsyn had brought out with him.

Nosenko knew that Golftsyn had taken this document, but

was not

faniliar with 1t.

This would not be possible if he had been

prepared by the KGB. Naturally Nosenko did not know Blake had

contributed to this

document--he had no need to know.

Along with the tendency to identify Nosenko's detractors

a8.

"knowledgeable sources", there is a corollary which casts doubt on

sources who help to substantiate his story. Five of these are

said to confirn Nosenko's identity. Some of these are cited above.

Another significant one is the 1959 naval defector, Artamonov. : The:

language used to describe Artamonov's comments on Nosenko is..

decidedly hostile, but there is no evidence at all to suspect

Artamonov. Artamonov made a major contribution

to U.S. Intell1-

gence; is highly respected by senior U.S. naval officers, and 1s.

the most intelligent and well-adjusted Soviet defector in the West.

He was

Golitsyn's best friend while Golitsyn was here, and Golitsyn

called him several times from England, having left both his dog

and color television with Artamonov.

We have found Artamonov to be

highly cooperative with persons who understand the Soviet system

and completely impatient with those who pretend to such knowledge.

He can probably make much more useful and valid comments on

some of

the points which Deryabin was asked to review.

Something should be said about Nosenko's memory. All memories

are selective, depending on personality, interests, requirements;

and other factors. : In a sense, nothing is ever forgotten, but in

practice we can recall only limited amounts from the sub-conscious.

## Page 31

As Nosenko

said:

"There are different types of menories." When

we consider that Nosenko has identified up to 200 leads for us,

over 400 KGB officers and agents, and 127 of 173 Americans In the

U.S. Embassy in 1960-62,. we must admit that he has exceeded most of

us in memory capability. In addition to these, he undoubtedly has

the usual fund of information centering on his family and non-career

life.

Jet, in examining his production and his statements, we expect

him to add all manner of trivia to the Immense amount of information

he has already provided, and we expect him to have

it right.

Then his memory of flying in lobster and vodka for agent projects

is called "ittle details." We have not asked as much of any other

defector. If we did, we would throw them all back. Although we

have no place near the agent stable in our past that Nosenko has

Identified, I would not be able to come close to the number of

Identifications Nosenko has made, and neither could anyone else.

Unfortunately for him, what is trivial to him on the inside 1s

far from trivial to us

on the outside, and the same no doubt applies

in the opposite direction.:

Another. factor which affects our evaluation of Rastvorov and

Deryabin as judges

of Nosenko is their conclusion that Nosenko's

history is such that he could never have been employed by the kGB.

Times have changed since they were there, since his employment

It is also curious;

If accepted at face those, because it would be additional

that Nosenko was protIlg accurate information, to the extent

that Golltsyn's and LEizEsia's reports agreed

with one another.

In fact, however, un Ietyabla points out correctly, in part,

Nosenko's memory li tre =s complete as Deryabin's, so he

not report as accurately

months.

1s superior in every respect except French agents and First

Directorate organiseleno.

There are a number of contradictions and discrepancies in

the notebook analyris e! Nosenko, sone of them quite significant.

The October 1964 status report, for example, makes the assertion

that. "Since NOSENKO's Inlsely-clalmed service in the American

Embassy Section coincides fairly closely with the period covered

by the KGB-concocted CHYREPANOY papers on the same Section's

actitties, and aince LULITSYN was aware of certain successful

33

from approximately 1957-8 to 1963." The quality of Golitsya's

knowledge has been discussed above. The key word in this very

critical and final judgment is "coincide". It 1s completely

false.: The Cherepanov papers cover the perlod 1957-8 to 1960,

while Nosenko's service In the American Embassy Section was from

:1960 to 1962. Possibly

some. other word was meant, but the fact

remains, Cherepanov and Nosenko.did not work in the Section during

the same period of time... If in fact the two events did colncide,

one would have to consider. them both more serfously; If the Soviets

had sent

Nosenko out, they probably would coincide. As

it 1s, the

Soviets cannot hope

to convince us with some "worthless" papers

about surveillance that there

were no Embassy penetrations for

three years and then feel obliged to send out an agent to convince

us there were none for three more years. Another case

concerns

the assertion that Nosenko

tells "pat" stories.

This is not

1llogical for someone who is relating gossip or someone else's

jokes. In the March 1964 memo, some 15 such stories are cited

"And the odd thing is that practically every time he tells the

story, regardless of the context of angle of approach to it, the

story comes out in exactly the same form, with exactly the same

details given in exactly

the

same way, no more and no less."

This is strong language. However, just a few pages later, with

equal vehemence, his stories are described as follows: "However,

the number and type of contradictions within NOSENKO's stories

go far beyond what could be considered normal." Now, strictly

speaking, these two violently opposite assertions could be true,

the ANDREY story. is given as an example in both cases! One

tends to lose a little confidence in the analysis at this

point, and perhaps doubt Its objectivity a bit. Later on,

the STORSBERG case, which was Included In the list of "pat"

stories, 1s said to have been told 50 times "with at least one

contradiction each telling." What are we to believe?

The same question of objectivity is raised by the adoption of

the stereotyped phrase "Ilar's face".. This 1s a subjective

observation; all persons have certain standard facial expressions.

under various circunstances..

There are even personalities

which constantly employ "false faces," people who are

always

actlig. It is dangerous to allow such a stereotype to enter

In and corrupt, or replace, judgment.

In effect, Nosenko stated the case for his own defense

very well:. "He would lay the blame on his Interrogators, saying

that he knows better how things are done in the Soviet Union

than we do..." I trust that none of us intends to argue this

point-Penkovskly told us this constantly, and 1t 1s quite correct.

"...that we

were twisting his story and making things

look dif

ferent; that we had already decided that he was 'false' and

weren't listening objectively." I believe the evidence given

above supports Nosenko on these two points; especially when

we recall that the meno which labeled him a "plant" was written

just two weeks after our first meeting with him in 1962.

The 30. April 1965 meno status report states: "Subject

case would be thrown out of court for lack of evidence.

How

that we appolat a new judge and jury for the Nosenko case and

Institute a change of venue. The participants should be per

In the U.S., then they know that such

defectors are held at arm's length:

Only in the past weeks have we

initiated a program to brief RIS

defectors even on our dead cases and

their production, although Deryabin

has been used on some aspects of

non-sensitive cases the last two years.

Most RIS defectors have little

qualifications.for, or Interest

In, work other than intelligence,

so the desire of Nosenko to aid us

Is normal and should be accepted to

the extent that we are using the

others.

B. Redefect, discredit U.S. Intelligence, and generate unfavor-

able publicity about us-If this is the Soviet alm, we have given

them a magnificent opportunity! Imagine what would happen 1f

Nosenko were a "plant"-the Soviets could make charges at any

moment pointing out that Nosenko had been kidnapped by us,

aided by the Swiss and Germans, and that he was now being held

against his will.

What could we do or say? One wonders If CIA.

would survive the subsequent furor in the press, Congress, and

abroad.

Who would believe our protestations that the goods had

been planted on us--the boy with his hand in the cookie jar is

seldom considered a reliable witness in his own defense.

If

Nosenko were a plant, the Soviets can get him back whenever they

want him, at our expense..

C. Discourage other defectors-How can he do this? If he did

* not serve In the KGB, as the notebook claims, RIS officers will

know that,

and what we do with him will not affect their own

intentions to defect. If we are wrong (which I am sure we are),

and Nosenko did serve in

the KGB, the knowledge of the double

game he is playing would spread among 'his past, present, and

future KGB colleagues and likewise have no effect on future

defections. The only way the KGB could hope to discourage

future defections through Nosenko would be for us to detain him

on false charges and for that fact to become known in the RIS.

In other words, Nosenko 1s a bona fide defector,: but we have made

it possible for the Sovlets to gain an unexpected windfall by

out treatment of him. There 1s no other rational explanation

of how they could hope to achieve this theoretical aim.

D. Protect existing Soviet agents in the West - There is nothing

lulling about Nosenko's list of 200 agents in the West, particu

larly the

key cases cited above. Nosenko's background and ex-

perience provide him no basis for reassuring us that no Americans

have been recruited outside Moscow, nor does

he try to do so

He goes

so. far as to point out that the most important cases

even

In his own directorate are taken out of the hands of the working

level and handled by the directorate chief personally. How, then,

could he conceivably mislead us about the agents recruited in

Moscow?. We have no evidence that he hag-it is Golitsyn's

disturbed personality. that confuses

the cases most, not Nosenko's,

including the ANDREY-JACK case

on which Golitsyn is said to have

been desk case officer for two years! The only suggestion of

evidence that Nosenko is misleading us is Golitsyn's hearsay

from a section chief who was 99 percent sure

he was about to

recruit an American code clerk; Nosenko said such a recruitment

was tried and failed. Who accepts this as proof? Nosenko told.

us that the Soviets were still receiving code machine informa

tion In 1964-what more do we need? Is this concealing an

agent? Quite the opposite. There 1s

no evidence to support

the "protection of agents" theory. We are fortunate that Nosenko

could tell us that they still have a high-level

agent-it was

surely not within his need-to-know.

E. Lure us into operations in the UNOf all the theorles, this

one is the most far-fetched. . Since we are already running a

disinformation agent in the UN, and have been since 1958, the Soviets

could pull the plug on this one at any time, and could have done

so in the past, either while the agent was on

TDy In New York,

or by assigning. him. PCS. If they want to move the UN, they have

other means. Since it has proven so useful for their own intel-

ligence operations in the past, it is safe to say that they will

leave It In New York for a while. Considering all the agents

they have run out of the UN, It is not likely that

anyone would.

take their protest

seriously just because we

were running one

agent there..

So, 1t 1s, after all, unreasonable to conceive aims which

would justify sending out an experienced intelligence officer

as a "plant,". Whatever purpose one might theorize, there are

better ways to accomplish that purpose. Whenever the Soviets

have set out to mislead by giving information, or by giving us

agents who are without information, they have succeeded only

because they follow the simplest possible formulas, including an

absolute minimum of fabricated legend, and the maximum base of

objective fact which is still consistent with their modest aims.

The all-accomplishing Great Plot 1s still generations in the

future•

What will it take to convince all of us that Nosenko 1s

bona fide? Nosenko expresses the wish that we will soon get

another KGB defector who will vouch for hin.: So do I. He can

say this confidently because he knows that if we already had a

KGB penetration that penetration would vouch for his bona fides.

Did

we tell him that we have no such penetration? If not, he can

only know it because he is innocent.. It is beyond reality to

argue that everyone in the KGB will vouch for Nosenko's story-

1t 1s not enough to alter a few organizational documents. The

truth comes fron life, not from the archives. If we call all

that and all those who have already vouched for Nosenko "suspect"

everything and everyone vouching for him in the future also as

"suspect," what do we have left? This way lies madness. What

kind of proof do we need of his innocence, when we call him guilty

with none?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Recent Developaents in the Review of the Nosenko Can

I. On 2 June I was contacted by the DDCI's Spettal Annistant, George

McManus, and asked to.cone to his office to discuss Soriet Ini,-Lligence collection

as it related to

Prior to this call I nad beure aware that

#cHanus was naking inquiries in the SB Dirision about ay poslulun and background.

In his office we discussed the SB collection progras and the necial contribution

of defectors. No comment was made by either of us regarding my talk with the DDI.

2. On 30 June, at ay request, I met with the ADDP to express concern at

having again been passed over for pronotion.

He inforted se that oy promotion lad

been approved but that It had not been nade effective becauss le and the DDP were

puzzled that I had gone over their heads to discuss the Mosenky case with the DICI.

He stated that it was not a crime to visit the DDCI, but that like DDP chain of

command should be followed, and all possible points of appeal for such a disagree-

ment should be exhausted before taking a matter to the Director's office. In reply,:

I stated that my action was prompted by the knowledge that the 3B Division paper on

Mosenko had been sent to the DDCI, that the DDCI was aware t'am! I had written a

dissenting opinion, and that he had expressed interest in that upinion.

3. The ADDP stated that he and the DDP were knowledganble of the Nosenio

case, that they had listened to some of the interrogation tappy, and that they were

inclined to accept the Division position. He advised ne that there vere sany facts

of walch I was not avare, and that it would be best 1? I would confine myself to

requirements natters, leating counterintelligence analysis to lhose persons who

were responsible for 1t.

He said that we had treated Hosenko In a gentlenanly

namer, walca was nore than the Soriets would do in a stallar inse.

4. I stated that the losenko case and zost of the ernes which the Division

connected with it were cases with which I had been Involved, that they were all

cases of evaluating production in comparative terus, and that vy experience in such

evaluations quallfied me to have ay tiews heard. He adrised un that if I would

out..

and the ADDP stated that he and the DDP were entirely avare of l'hat attitude and

were watching it closely. This has since becose apparent to as,

5. After ay return fron vacation, on 12 July, CSB called me in to for-

malize the pronotion and emphasize that he was solely responsible for 1t... It was

clear that ae had discussed my visit to the dict with the latiny and that the DDCI

had perely confired the visit and conunicated the gist of rantion to the paper

which the Division had sent hin on the Nosenko case.

two Division officers who had been evaluatine thi

rosento paper vere obliged to mite up their critical views and subait then

to CSB.

He subsequently stated that their criticisms would be useful in

tightening up the paper, and advised thes to continue to analyze the paper

for this purpose.

Taey continue to find major flaws in the case against

Hosenko.

CSB inforned then that the paper forwarded to the DDCI was only &

draft, and that there were bound to be discrepancies and inconsistencies in

a paper so complex and involving so many authors.

T. On 24 August I was called in by CSB/CI and told that I could no

longer discuss the losenko case with any of the several officers under his

jurisdiction who were working on the case, and that any of those officers

who initiated such discussions with me should be asked if they had his per

aission to do so. I agreed to honor this arrangement but emphasized that y

only interest in such discussions was to facilltate a thorough and objective

review of the Mosenko case. I then recomended that the two officers be

given uy Deceaber 1965 paper on the case, and this was subsequently done.

8. Since ny determined actions to expedite reopening of the Nosenko

case have led the Division and the DDP to disown zy views and to exclude me

Iron the revier of the case, I see no existing forun for my views within the

Clandestine Services.

Therefore, in spite of the DIP's advice that I either

refrain fron having an opinion, or express it only within the Division or

the CS, I have a sense of urgency that the attached views on the disposition

of the Nosenko case be considered at the command level of the Agency where the

ultimate decision

must be made.

This 1s a partioularly

crippling position, as our two beat positive

These actions are primarily injurious to persons

Immedlately In the division, but the reduction of their

Individual contributions reduces over all effectiveness.

The klanapping episode discredited the division and the

Agency, and 1s

a blatant example of the disregard of tha

division chief for the vlows of his staff. The require

ment that division personnel mutely and blindly follow

him,

abandoning their judgment and self-respect, allenates

some of the best people in the division, and has been tha

direot cause of at least one serious 11lness and a con-

tributing factor to a number of health problems of others.

The motivation of experienced people who still occupy &

few responsible posts in the division has been serlously

eroded by the unhealthy pollcies sumarized above, and

the related lack of Intelligence succese.

What, I have stated here are my own sincere and

sober vlews.

The concern which I feel for this stato of

aflatra has

Increased to the polot where I am mentally

distressed and physically affected by this catastrophia

development In my chosen profesaion.. Even 11 the present

i an my da

Insidious trend were to be abruptly ended, It would take

many goars to rectify the damage, ln the minde of our

own persornel, in operational files and guidance, and

with other agencies and 11a1s0n services. I an entirely

committed by experience, qualifications,

and Inolination

to work on collection against the sovlet target. Now

discouraged in this work, I would find it difficult to

regenerate this lost enthuslasm in a new assigment.

However, If there is no hope of a thorough revlew of the

positions and methode of the division within the next

few montha, I feel that both my professional and personal

welfare will require that I find some other assignment.

In committing these vlews to paper, I am aware

that the positions and actions which I cite as offcosive

are also the product of experienced and dedicated Agency

employees, to whom I Impute no dishonorable motives.

However, I belleve it fair to state that the present

operational philosophy of the division 1s tallor made

to sult the. KGB; several present and past SR Division

officers have made this obaervation. It appears to me

that the division chief's preoccupation with the KGB and

mania for attributing so many of the world's 111s to them

1s a product of his own professional frustration.

An

example of this outlook 1s given in Attachment D.

appears to hold the KGB respoisible for a long history

of personal fallures:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meeting with CSB on the Nosenko. Paper

1.

On 4 April 1967; the present senior

case officer on the BOURBON case, Jim Flint, who

was on TDY at Headquarters,, Came to my office

at my request to discuss the bonafides of BOURBON.

In this discussion I mentioned to him other cases

now going on which Headquarters has related to

BOURBON, and recommended that he ask the GRU. Desk.

for briefings on these cases. I also advised

him that a

major SB Division paper on Nosenko,

which mentions BOURBON, was now well over 700

pages, and that it was

being prepared for the

Director.

In addition, I told him that a number

of persons in the Division and outside the Division

who had read the Division's earlier papers on

Nosenko disagreed with the Division's findings.

2.

On 5 April 1 was told; by an sB Divisio

" officer who was involved, that CSB had calle

him in on that date and questioned him regarding

the origins of the information which I provided

Flint.

Later I learned that another officer of

the same branch was questioned simultaneously by

C/SB/CI, and that immediately after the two meet-

ings were held, the first officer was recalled.

by CSB for further questioning. Both officers

were, sternly warned not to divulge to anyone that

they had

been questioned.

On 7 April I was called to the office

of CSB

at 1630 hours and met with him until 1730

SECRET

- 2-

hours.

He stated that he had a memorandum written

by Flint which reported a number of statements

I had made to Flint.

He was particularly con-

cerned about an "impression" Flint got that I

had indicated that the DDCI was reviewing the

Division's Nosenko paper.

I replied that I had

no knowledge of such a review, and therefore

certainly could not have said

such a thing to

I repeated what I had told Flint about

the Nosenko paper, as stated above. CSB stated

that for my information, the Nosenko paper had

been finished and in the hands of the Director

for three weeks, which was news to me. He also

stated that it was perfectly alright for the

DDCl to have a copy of the paper, in his position,

and that he would tell appropriate Division person-

nel that they should not be concerned that the

DDCI had a copy of the paper.

CSB told me that

if I wished to raise the level of my disagree-

ment about Nosenko to the DDP or DDCI, he would

glad to go along with me to discuss the matter

in their presence.

He said that he had lunched

recently with the DDCI and discussed the paper

with him, which was not the first such meeting

with DDCI on the subject.

4. CSB stated that because of the privileged

position I enjoy in regard to Division operational

intormation, he had to be able to trust me in the

handling of

that information.

I agreed, and stated

that in my judgment Flint had a need to know items

I had mentioned to him.

As to the origin of my.

information, none of which I received officially,

I stated that I made a point of maintaining a

good listening post in the informal organization.

In addition, most personnel who have served in

the Division

very long always assume that any

current case will have been surfaced to me for

intelligence exploitation. Therefore they do not

hesitate to discuss new cases because they believe

I have a need to know.

New York. He stated that the first case had

no such value, and that the second was not under

his control.

Although I disagree with both

statements, especially since a Division officer

is meeting with the New York walkin, I said

nothing.

CSB stated that it is essential that

personnel in the Division, other divisions and

other agency components. do not feel that he and

I have opposite attitudes toward intelligence

collection.

He asked if there was a personal

factor in my opposition to his views and I as-

sured him there was

not. I pointed out that as

long as the Division had the negative attitude

which was exemplified by the Nosenko, SCOTCh' the

BOURBON, Farmakovskaya, the New York walkin,

[CoZY case, and numerous other minor cases,

would not collect any intelligence on the USSR.

This was the only point at which he became upset,

stating that he could not agree with the Polyannas

who say that the US Government is not penetrated

and that the Soviets do not know every move we

make. I stated that I did not agree with them

either, but that I disagreed most strongly with

the Division's positions on most of these cases,

and would not defend them.

6.

I tried to explain that most of the

Division personnel who are aware of the cases

which are lumped in with Nosenko have doubts about

the validity of the Nosenko paper.

He said that

he met with them and knew their views, and I sug-

gested that his own views, and the deputy divisior

chiet's, were stated so vigorously and categorically

in those meetings, that other persons were reluctant

to contest these views.. He did not believe this,

but I added that since

all of them were at his

mercy in their careers,

they did not want to get

into a vehement argument with him, leaving bruises

on both sides.

In closing I stated that I would not

needed help, but CSB said he knew

Flint and that it was just separation from his

family that had been the problem.

(I did not

tell CSB that Flint asked me privately to get

him removed from: the BOURBON job, stating that

he found it extremely trying. Also, I did not

tell. Flint. that I knew of his memo.)

8.

Immediately after my meeting with him,

CSB called in all senior CI personnel in the

Division. He began by stating that he knew he

was pompous and domineering but that it was most

important to him to know if any of them had

doubts about the Nosenko paper.

Of five persons,

three admitted, two for the first time, that they

had doubts about the paper. Initially

surprised,

he eventually dismissed these doubts as the

reasonable doubt that is always present in the

intelligent mind. He then told the group that

the

DDCI had a copy of the Nosenko paper, and

that it was proper for him to have a copy, so

that no one should be concerned about that fact.

He also told them that someone outside the Division

might be coming to talk to them about the paper.

Discussion of whereabouts of copies of the Nosenko

paper led one person present to believe CSB was

trying to determine how a copy of the paper reached

DDCI.

9.

On 24 April my immediate superior returned

from leave, and on 26 April she was called in by

CSB and he showed her a memo for the record of

his conversation with me.

He stated that he did

not intend to forward it

to anyone.

He said that

he had discussed the incident with

who was

concerned, and with DDCI.

her that he intended to continue me in my present

position and to "stand by" my promotion recommendation,

which he has again submitted.

In the memo, he

repeated the assertion that I had told Flint

that "a group outside the Division" was going

to review the Nosenko paper, which is a slight

change from what he told me, and information

that I did not previously have to tell anyone.

My superior indicated to CSB that I had already

described

my meeting with him to her.
