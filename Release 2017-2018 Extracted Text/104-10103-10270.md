Summary of Contacts with

HELSINKI:

1. Events of 30 July 1962:

AHTP arrIved in Helsinki on 30 July 1962.

He called HBrINCH

according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's

abystmal understanding of English), Fallucc

established contact. with

AMWHIP without further difficulty. The meeting took place in the

restaurant of his hotel, the Yaakuna, and later in his room. We had

not at this time located AMASH, so the time was spent briefing AMWHIP

on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH when they met. The

meeting lasted about one and a half hours.

Later the same day we called AMHIP at his hotel to report

no progress in locating AMASH. Feeling it advisable to keep AMWHIP

occupied, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the

suburbs of Helsinki

The evening lasted until 1200, terminating with a

drink at the root har of the vaakuna. luring the six hours, we had an

opportunity to explain carefully to AMWHIP that in order for us to help

his friend, AMLASH must be willing to follow our directions and agree to

certein conditions (elready greed apon hy interested Ige, parties).

AMWHy?, realized that this was necessary, and agreed with our ideas. However,

racked to AMLASH, and will continue to look upon him in the most

benevolent and subjective manner. This being rather far removed from our

intended approach to, and opinion of AMASH. AWHIP will require handling

of a close nature in order that he fully understands and is aware of our

would have an effort made in the morning to locate AMLASH, and that he

night as well relax, sight-see if he wished, and that we would be in touch

that the latter tried his best, but had not been able to do us any good,

also reported that its contacts had been unable to aid us.

We reported to AMRIP the fact that we had not located AMASH, and suggested

that we have dinner together, to which he agreed.

_We met ANNHIP. at 2100

at our hotel, the Kamp, and proceeded to the Royal Restaurant for dinner.

+ AWHIP was obviously getting on pins and needles because we had not found

his friend. He suggested that we call up the Cuban Festival delegation,

or try some hotels that evening. We persuaded him that it was not the

best idea jet; and to give other people more time to locate him. He

agreed, but kept coning up with ideas all evening for ways to locate AMLASH.

• He suggested that AMASH liked night clubs, and that after dinner we could

perhaps try several. We agreed, more to placate hin that with any thoughts

of success.

We tried several, the Brunsparken and the Theater Grill,

both of which were filled with drinking

_but no signs of AMLASH. The

engaging in their national pastime, obviously irritated Alwil", and

efter being puched around in the Icader Crill for an hour, hu said that

he thought this was a waste of time. We agreed, grabbed a taxi and went

home. During the evening, we told AWHIP that tomorrow morning, if nothing

had turned up, we would start by calling the better hotels in town ourselves,

and try this rather laborious method to locate AM.ASH.

We agreed to meet

AWHIP talked to AMASH for at least seven hours, from about

1000 in the morning until approximately 1700 the same evening. When AMHTP

called us at 1730, he presented us with the fact that he had convinced

AMLASH to talk with us, and for this purpose, he had arranged dinn

meeting that sane evening for approximately 1930. We would have preferred

to talk longer with AWHIP about. AMLASH's reactions; but time did not

permit. We arranged a dinner for 2100 at "The White Lady", a restaurant

some way from the center of town, and succeeded in obtaining & private

dining room, a practice not uncommon in this

recommended restaurant,

as it is often used by businessmen to have private dinners and afterwards,

business discussions;

We arrived at the White Lady first, arranged for the dinner, and

awaited AMWHIP and AMLASH, who arrived at 2110 by taxi. Although AMWHIP

had suggested to us that the discussions should be nerely devoted to

getting acquainted the first evening, AMLASH commenced almost immediately

into a discussion of his feelings and, his position concerning Cuba today.

As reported

7609) AMLASH was quite intense, and showed

the strain of his unexpected meeting with AMWHIP. Although obviously

under emotional strain, AMLASH presented his feelings in a relatively calm

marmer, and was fives in locussing than throughout the seal. He cold he

was considering not going back to Cuba, but after talking to AMWHIP, he

felt that if he could do something really significant for the creation of

a new Cuba,' he was interested in returning to carry on the fight there.

He said he was not interestea in risking mis life for auy shai undertaking,

but that if he could be given a really large part to play, he would use

know; are at a critical stage today. He also wanted to pian the execution

of Carlos Rodriguez and the Soviet Ambassador, and also to ejiminate Fidel,

by execution if necessary. He feels that if Fidel is eliminated, it would

be much easier to effect a take-over. (we listened for the most part, but

at this point tried to emplain to AMASH that men like Rodriguez could easily

be replaced by Moscow, and that the killing of the Soviet Ambassador, would

have only the briefest effect

not too interested in listening at this point, and continued by saying that

if he could achieve all these actions, plus others, in ore master stroke,

a take-over, during the ensuing confusion, would be much facilitated.. He

did not feel that Raul or Che would be able to rally the people in sufficient

time to prevent opposition forces from forming. His arguments and pians hai

professed desire for vigorous and, hepefully, effective actions, designed

to alter the situation in no uncertain terms. While we were making no

conmittments or plans, we pointed out to AMASH that schemes like he envisioned

certainly had their place, but that a lot of coordination, planning, information-

collection, etc., were necessary prerequisites to ensure the value and success

of such plans. AMASH said he agreed with this, but we weren't too sure just

AMLASH made

it clear during the discussions that he was completely

against Fidel's use of Soviet help from the first, but he had never envisioned,

that even if it vere'used, just how ineffective it really would be towards

solving Cabals problemss ne stil reel:

the

plight of the lower classes in Cuba, and In any future Cuba, he would stint

Insist on a new deal for them. AMLASH said that although he had not been:

elfective In helping the formation of a beneficial new Government in Cuba, e

tie was now prepared to work towards that end. This time, he said, he

wanted. to look more towards the future, both for his own interests and for

Cuba's. The last time, he said that he thought only as far as the elimination

of Batista, and had not given consideration to planning for a government he

farorey after the fighting was over. We felt that AMASH meant that he was

as mich concerned about his (AMLASH's) position in the government and

personal stake in a new Cuba, as he was about arything else.: It is our

Impression that AMLASH feels that he did not get his share of the spoils

or power fron the Castro regime, in proportion to his contribution against

Batista. AMLASH is a complicated personality.

It is difficult to fairly

judge, at this time, AMASH's degree of concern for a truly revolutionized

Cuba for the people's benefit, vs his concern to see a new government in.

Cuba in which he gets just recognition. This does not necessarily mean

that AMLASH wants high political office, but he does want credit for his

efforts and the resultant power and prestige among his countrymen.

In addition to his concern for the manner in wnich the soviets are:

using Cuba for their nun designs in Tatio America, AM.ASH. is worried about

the extent to which Castro is using. the Soviet technique of capturing the

minds of the young people and the mass propaganda efforts against the masses

Iraats from the Soviete. Although AMASH did not say it.In so many words,

Is was apparent from the discussions that AMLASH would prefer ta be able to

free Cuba without any outside support (and by inference, obligations), but

Did 1s a realist enough to concede that any efforts to overthrow Castre

pat have the support of PRIME. He is, therefore, willing to enter into:

A scussions with a representative (s) of PBPRIME towards this end.

ALASH agreed to meet in Paris for the purpose of further debriefings

wil to give any information in any field which he has. He is also most

w/lling to discuss any plans which may lead to an overthrew of the present:

ivernment. AMIASH stated many times, however, during the course of the

seetings, that he was only interested in involving himself in a plan-of

windficant action, and which was truly ursigued in achleve rapicly his desire

he felt that the Cubans there were completely penetrated by Castro informants,

and that for then to know of his cooperation with PBPRIME; would be the same

as telling Castro, and thus his future would end against the Wall! We

assuredunn that maxman security would be practiced, as far as there people

were concerned. He also does not wish to trust or be Involved with; any

This meeting terminated at 0030 on 2 August. The three participants.

took a taxi together back 'to tom. AMWHIP and AMLASH stopped off at a local

No incidents:

of a security nature were observed, and it was felt that the meeting was

held without the knowledge or observation of the opposition.

•4. Meeting of 2 August 1962.

We met with AMHIP in his hotel room (No. Il2 at the Vaakuna) at

1700 hours on 2 August. We discussed the events and talks of the preceding

evening for some time. At approximately 1800, AMLASH arrived, greeted

us affably, and joined us for a drink. AMLASH used this meeting to re-:

state his position concerning' his desire for participation in a reaily

significant action against the Castro regime. Having decided by this time

that further discussions and debriefings of AMASH should take place with

a Spanish-speaking C/O, we outlined the idea to meet for such a purpose in

Parise. AMLASH did not like the idea of too many nemle boing punno af his

cooperation with PBPRIME, but agreed that it would be best in order to

allow himself to express his ideas and plans better, and to be able to provide:

us with his information in the greatest possible detail.

that he lelt that he had better perform this role to some extent, as it was

expected of him by Fidel, and he did not wish to provide any unnecessary

chances for unsatisfactory reports to be sent back home concerning his lack

of cooperation with the cuban delegation. In making the arrangements for

a Paris meeting and further discussions, AMASH said, in response to the

question, that It would be quite normal for him to be in Paris, as he had

already cleared this with Fidel; with whon, he remarked caustically, one

had to clear everything these days. He then expressed the idea that he

6. Other Youth Festival Targets•

This area covered by cables

1581 and

1609: The best

and, actually, only possibility among the participants was Jose Venegas.

However, both AMLASH and AMHIP did not want to become involved with him

as they felt that this, in both their cases, might compromise their

interests in AMASH's returning to Cuba, AMWHIP felt, for example, that,

Venegas would almost certainly connect his presence here with an attemot to

do something with AMLASH.: AMLASH also felt that he did not want to disclose

any indications of his real sympathies to Tenegas, if he (AMASH) were going

to return to Cuba.

Without doing this, It would be difficult to get any

reactions or opinions from Venegas, thought AMLASH. Venegas, it Is felt

by AMLASH, might very possibly be counted on at a later date if this was:

desirable. An approach could then be worked out at that time,

As reported, AMASH came to the Festival as a "special delegate,"

after his request to Fidel was approved. AMASH.Claimed to Fidel that he

was fatigued and sick and needed a good rest in Europe. The Festival

provided the excuse, Fidel bit the bait, and AMLASH got to Europe to see

AMHIP, his criginal intentic. AMHIP felt that this is a logical end

honest explanation.. It is interesting to note that neither the local

service, /2, or any of the Cuban delegates he asked, could determine the

whereabouts of AMASH. It is perhaps reasonable to assume that the Cubans

were told not to tell of his presence to anyone not from their immediate

delegation.

7. AMHTP'S Roie in AMLASH Talks.

AWHIP has been most helpful and cooperative in establishing

the initial contacts with AlIASH, and he undoubtedly does have mich

influence over AMLASH. AMLASH also trusts AMWHIP explicitly, as evidenced

by his remark to us that AWHIP, was the only one whom he felt tha

could fully trust and to whom he could speak openly. Of course, he dia

speak openly at length to us at the behest of AWHIP, but it is also

obrious that he does not tell us everything. AWilp has given good advice ne

Rich 9:

in the handling of AMLASH, but, as he has a tendency to interpret AMLASH's

remarks and feelings subjectively, and to attempt to guide us a bit too

much, it might be wise to elininate in later portions of the talks in Paris.

With a Spanish speaking go, this showd noi be too difficult to do, and

without alienating AMWHIP. AMVHIP has no clandestine training to speak of,

as evidenced by his actions in this case. However, to his eredit; he

responds readily to directions in this area, and follows rather well suggestiors

for adding to the security of the meetings. His rerark about the s

adrisability of keeping his old friend ANCONCERT/l out of the operation or

from any knowledge thereof, is gratifying. AWHIP also has gently explained

to us, that while he is a Cuban at heart and loves the Cubans, they simply

cannot be trusted to keep secrete among any ce their friends aho, fur fu.

real tested reasons, they consider safe and discreet. As a general

statement, we feel that AMWHIP is a good security risk operationally, and

that with more exposure to the game, will become a good and useful asset

under almost any circumstance. He is, however, somewhat subconsciously:

subjective about his evaluations of AMLASH. He is completely honest, and is

using a considerable amount of his own money, not to mention time, in this

ceration. We only hope his

For the sake of completeness, we repeat our coments regaraing

AMLASH from

1609:

He appears capable of rash, thoughtless, violent

action under the strain of provocation, tense situations,

or frustration...

For example, he stated

to us that last year

dejection and frustration, he had con-

templated suicide.. Although AMLASH appeared to concede

some validity to.our arguments fos planring and for

see a job through. However, AMIHIP assures us that

when AMLASH says he'll do something, he will. We

don't know at this point.

AMWHIP also told us that in discussions subsequent to our meetings

AMHIP. was sure,-as

that he would defect, period. AMASH told AMWHIP that he could not see

the point of making a statement regarding defection and the state of affairs

in Cuba, and then accepting a dole in Miami. Nor could he see any use in"

propaganda efforts in Latin America or Europe. Later, after our talks

with him; AMLASH told AMWHIP a little different story, i esy that hem

auld not want to make a public defection statenent, because of the

probable repercussions against his friends in Cuba for no good reason.

This area of thinlang needs to be examined at length in Paris. A Spanish

speaking C/a might well do the trick.

STOCKHOLM:. •

COPENHAGEN:

10. Travel to, and Stop In Copenhagen.

AMLASH and AMWHIP took SAS flight 407 to Copenhagen on the after-

noon of 10 August.

In speaking at length about meeting. in Paris, AMLASH

felt sure that

there would be no problem in getting pernission to visit

Paris after returning to Prague. He felt that he better not visit Paris

first, as it might cause some undue interest in Prague Cuban circles

as to why he was away so long. He also had some trouble in getting the Air-

line to approve his side trips to Stockholm and Copenhagen. They wanted

him to fly direct to Prague: from Helsinki. He refused their requests,

and said that he would pay his own way to Stockholm and Copenhagen for

the difference) if need he.

This he finally had to do, for which AMiap

footed the bill. (perhaps we should later absorb). (We felt that this

ability to pay for the extra routing might cause some suspicion among his

colleagues. AMLASH said "no", but we are not so sure. Perhaps he can tell

dren, should thoy us curious, that MiHTf paid the bill, as all row be a

to us as a friend, rather than as a PRPRIME representative. During

of view, but nevertheless, If we intended to win the struggle, we must

do as the Communists do, and disregard the archaic and doomed old-line:

more agressive way to deal with the probler, but that such methods vould

leave us open to the old familiar charges of interference in the internal

affairs of sovereign countries. AMASH emiled and replied that frona

practical viewpoint this didn't nake any difference, for If we didn't

act forcefully and soon; there wouldn't be any opportunities there for us

to be open to anything! He then cited Venezucla as the next obrious s

Obviously AMASH was correct 'in much of his thinking, but rather thay stand

ing still with our shoes untied, we gave him the ball by soliciting from

him, as a former student leader and politician, any ideas he might hate

for combating the Commnists in the struggle for the minds of Latin

this problem and to offer what ideas and suggestions he could.

use of Spanish and the propitious moment

discussing the various aspects of AMLASH's future role in Cuba, we usedvi

the ter "assassinate". The use of this term, we later learned from

ANTIP and from IS Linself, was most objectionable to the latter, and

he was visibly upset. It was not the act he objected to, but rather merely

the choice of word used to describe it. "Eliminate" was acceptable, but

lously the term "assassinate' had a distasteful connotation. From

discussions with AMWHIP, this lable of "assassin" had been given to

AMLAS" after sone of his escapades against Batista supporters in the

pre-Castro era. Another example, which AWHIP discussed with us, occurred

during a meeting in Mexico City in March 1961, when a KUBARKER said to

AMLASH; "I'm prepared to help you in any wey within my power". According

•to AMWHIP, AMLASH later turned to him, shrugging his shoulders in a manner

of saying, "So I need help from hin?" These examoles are pointed out

According to prior arrangements with AHIP and AMLASH, AWHIP

take a late afternoon fjight dom to Paris. As it turned out, however,

AMLASH was able to book a passage on a Fumanian Airlines (Tarom) Flight

to Frague, via last eriin's Schoenieldt Airport. AMHIP later took

the early evening flight to Paris; me took the 1150 AF flight the same

night.

In Paris, AMWHIP took a room (#60) as planned at the Hotel Franklin,

where he remained throughout his stay in Paris. He also booked a room

for AMLASH. We arrived in Paris at 0145, 16 August, booking a rooms

Following this meeting, we went to a small bistro near our hotel, phoned

AWHIP, and arranged for a meeting in our hotel room at 1830

This meeting took place in our hotel room (#ll) at the Hotel

'Roblin,

at 1830. Ine purpose was merely to meet AMWHIP and re-assure him

that arrangements for AMLASH's meeting were laid on. We also made

arrangements to give hin his expenses for the trip and account for same

during a meeting the following day. This will permit him to leave for

Milan without delay at the close of our business with AMLASH.: He was

getting "nervous", as he called it, and will be glad to get this business

over and done. We agreed. He wanted to remain until the conclusions of

the talks with AMLASH, however; for he felt that he could be of use in

handling AMLASH. We agreed. He did not, of course, want to be in on

any operational discussions, but

just to be on hand to guide his

tempermental: "charge":

He was very anxious to meet wallace A. Growerya in order to

point out to him in advance some of the quirks in AMASH's personality.

In talking to us, AWHIP said that a person with the background of

Aruhon, must be hanity in a certait mauer, tand if done, he will beapord.

ArWhIp told us that while he is of course subjective about AMlASH, he also

realized that he is of a different background and make-up (Mattery?)

than either we or himself, and that in order to get him to produce and

cooperate, the problem must be approached in a certain way. He said

"AWHIP continually stressed the point that to work with people.

Iike AMLASHj16 was necessary to have them first accept a person either

by personal contact o

over a period of time or on the recommendation of a

good friend. He felt that while it was necessary for us to spend some time

becoming acquainted with AMiASH, It also might be necessary for Growery

to go slow at first. This, we said to AMWHIP was all right; up to a point,.

but that we felt quite enough time had been spent with AMLASH already,

and that the meetings in were going to get down to business quickly,

and proceed as necessary to conclude business as rapidly as possible.

We felt that AMVHIP understood our point.

During this talk, AlVIP again expressed the feeling that if

Cuba-is not returned to freedom within tro years, he was going to sei

up business permanently in

or Southern California, and forget the

idea of returning. He was obvious moved by the finality of such a decision,

as he is a real Cubal patriot. or so we believe:

We agreed to contact AMWHIP by telephone at his hotal at 1200

26. Miscellaneous Comments on Case, Personalities, and Actions in Paris.

AMLASH's attitude in Paris was essentially that which it had

been during the previous contacts, in Scandinavia, that is, changeable as

the weather, varying frau occasional flashes of wit and nirth to degrees

of discouragement and perhaps despondency.

He was generally receptive and

should he become tired, bored, or disinterested. His social graces are

not the sharpest honed. He can, however, be reasoned with, even in some

of his contrary noods. AMWHIP was particuierly effcctive in tacuing nim

during these.. We are in complete agreement with AMWHIP when he describes

AMLASH as being full of complexes.

But further than that, AMASH not only

has cutiexes as such, but it is felt that he is generally preoccupied

incapable of maintaining his interest in things about him for any length

of time. If one is discussing Cuba, however, he obviously is very

interested. Therefore, it night well be that he is actually so pre-

occupied with thoughts about problems at home, that all else is secondary

and treated accordingly. When, on occasion, he "opened up"a bit with us,

It was obvious that he had, done, and was doing, a great deal of thimang

about Cuban problems. It may be that Growery will have much more to say

ai this point; as their discussions were in AMASH's native tongue. On

mary occasiong hustle rather exasperating to deal rela, but me sogl

that this is a trait of his which is a normal fact of his personality,

and not assuned to try the metal of his case officers. We may be wrong,

but doubt it.

27. Physical Appearance:

AMLASH is about 5'1l", weighs about 175 lbs, dark wavy hair,

thinning noticably on top and usually needs combing; brown eyes, small,

almost pestulant mouth, small nose, pale complexion, eyes are a little

small for his face and very intense in expression. He prefers dressing

informally, and is prone to wearing jackets with no tie. (He could

mingle with the typical small town corner-loungers without difficulty:)

When dressed up, he presents a good appearance in a masculine way, and

apparentiy from inwilt's stories, does quite well with the women. Concerning

the question of his being a homosexual, we cannot say khether he has a

hidden bent in this direction, but if he does, he is not at any rate, a

purist. but rather Af-De.

20... Language.

Native Spanish, fair to good English, but with limited vocabulary.

He can be successfully conversed with using. English, but it has to be

done slowly and with basic constructed sentences. It is not possible to

be articulate with him, if he is expected to grasp the full meaning of the

conversation.
