of a self-employed artist.

LEVITT's bank reference

was listed as the Manufacturers Trust Company, 14th

Street and

Second Avenue, NAMI

The above information may only be made available

upon the issuance of the usual subpoena duces tecum.

knowledge of Cuban activities in the US were contacted

during June and July, 1962, and could furnish no

further Information concerning LEVITT.

t is felt that subject

repeatedly in contact with various

women He also was
