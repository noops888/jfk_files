Hotel.

October 29, 1970

On September 1, 1970 N.C. N.A. representative

been contacted by

and,

at her request, Yu nad agreed to meet filers at the v.C.N.A.

oremises the following morning at 10:00 a.m.

PU also mentioned

that he had a particularly busy schedule for the following day

with appointments commencing at 7:30 a.m.

On September 2, 1970, prior to Rita PHIPPS' 10:00 a.M.

appointment, PU was visited by a male

individual named Mr. LIE

(phonetic) who, although he spoke a few words in Chinese, conversed

with PU almost entirely in English. LIE was evidently fron the

U.S.A. and although he didn't mention his address, he did say

he was in the process of moving to Seattle where he hopes to

return to graduate studies. He mentioned further that about

five years ago he was working towards a Doctorate in Theoretical

Physics and did a lot of research work for the National Science

Foundation in America.

He claimed to be the only scientisi in

his field to have obtained a grant from that institution:

LIE said that during those years he was essentially

apolitical but had developed a dislike for China because of what

he read in the bourgeois press. Then, when "they" started blaming

the Vietnam war on Chinese aggression

he started studying about

China and formed a completely opposite opinion.

This prompted

decision on his part to convey the results of his-research in

Theoretical Physics to China rather than to the capitalist U.S.

Government, so he wrote a letter to Dr. NEEDHAM, a professor in

england,

requesting NEEDHAM's assistance in obtaining entry to

China with his research material.

(COMMENT: Dr. NEEDHAM is almost

certainly identical to Dr. Joseph NEEDHAM, a prominent. British

Sinophile who neads the Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding)•

Our source advises that at this point in the LIE PU

meeting their discussion was interrupted by the scheduled 10:00 a.I.

arrival of Rita PHIPPS. PU introduced Mrs. PHIPPS to N.C.N.A.

Translator LO Yi-ching and LO's wife, and to Mr. LIE.

Their sub-

sequent conversation was dominated almost entirely by LIE with

only occasional remarks from Rita PHIPPS, and almost no comment

by any of the others present.

LIE related how he had once met David CROOK, a

British subject who spent many years in China teaching at a foreign

language institute.

He said the meeting took place in the Chinese

Embassy, London,

England, when LIE was at the Embassy

seeking ar

entry visa to China.

The visa was.not authorized because of the

disruption in China resulting from the Cultural Revolution.

Although LIE has not met CROOK since then, he has heard that CROOK

returned to China where he was arrested.

He said that he hearc

Anna Louise STRONG was also arrested during the Cultural Revolution

as were many other foreigners.

then asked those present wheu..

Ne they were

acquainted with a revolutionary group in the San Francisco Bay

area

to which Rita PHIPPS remarked being familiar with the Bay

Area

Revolutionary Unions and its publication,

"Red Paper".

Within this context LIE mentioned knowing Susan WINE (or HONG)

(or WARREN) (phonetic) in New York and also Marg RUSSEL, two

Americans who are associated with China.

Marg RUSSEL is about

77 years old and used to live in China but for the past ten years

has been travelling across the U.S.A. "telling the truth about

China" to universities, church groups, etc.

She is editor of a

paper called Far Eastern Reporter and, in LIE's opinion, is a.

very advanced communist.

According to LIE, Marg russel told him about this

San Francisco Bay area group and

invited him to go out to the

West coast not realizing that he planned to go there anyway.

"They"

and

Marg rUSSEL tola Lit that people from China or people who visit

China are assisting in the formation of this party so as to

Marg RUSSEL also

told lIt this new party would be more advanced than the Black

Panthers or the American Communist Workers movement•

LIE mentioned that he and his wife are also acquainted

with Sterling NEWBERRY and his wife, NEWBERRY being another political

activist in the U.S.A.

He recalled

that about four years ago the

NEWBERRYs lost their jobs as teachers because of their political

activities and although they were not then pro-Macist, they aid

profess to be socialists.:. Later,

they wrote to LIE from Cleveland

saying they intended to go to New York, and that they now believed

in Chairman MAO's thought.

LIE met them in New York and took them to "ouri

friend Susan WINE (Or WONG) (Or WARREN) (phonetic) to talk about

the political situation in America.. We also talked about Sterling

NEWBERRY's newspaper, "The Workers

Advocate", which has since been

changed to "Mass Lines". LIE expressed the view -that "Mass Lines"

is not really a mass paper, the masses don't read it,

even heard about it.

It is too theoretical and doesn't try to

understand the problems of the people whereas the Black Panther

a ok anchor.

paper, although not as elevated in political content, is far more

to the point and has a circulation of about 250,000 weekly as

compared to about 1000 for "Mass Lines"

LIE considers NEWBERRY

to be sort of arrogant

and easily angered by any form of crivicism;

he also feels that NEWBERKY is prone to exaggeration about his

own power and influence.

Conversation was interrupted at this point by the

arrival of a Mrs. Dora TONG and Mr. TONG whom LIE introducea as

his friends.

At

another point he referred to his friend TANG

Ying-shen (phonetic), who may be identical to one

of the TONGs.

LIE remarked that he

would have to. leave soon to take his friends

to the airport because they are flying to Toronto for a brief

visit before going "back to work".

It seems the TONGs had onward

reservations from I'oronto to Amherst (possibly Amherst, Massachusetts)

and they had to ve back in Amherst by the following evening.

Rita PHIPPS' husband arrived next with their two

daughters, Anna and Jessica, and Rita introduced them to PU Chao-

to Mr. TONG and his wife Dora TONG, to LIE and

The gathering broke up shortly afterwards with

the

TONGs departing by taxi to the airport, and LIt departed with the

: PHIPPS family: LIE mentioned that he had a Volkswagon bus and

that ithey" (presumably he and his family) would be travelling

in

it in their move across country to the West. Arrangements were

made for LIE and the PHIPPS to meet PU Chao-min for dinner at a

local restaurant later that

same evening.

Before leaving, LIE provided PU Chao-min with a

telephone number for Susan WINE (WONG) (WARREN) (phonetic) in

New. York at 212-CH2-0021.

He described her as an ardent Maoist.

Another reliable source confirmed that on the

evening of September 2, 1970 PU

Chao-min and IO Yi-ching, and their

wives

ned at a restaurant in Ottawa together with a caucasion

couple ind their four chilaren. We presume this was the PHIPPS

family referred to above but

there was no indication that Mr. LIE

accompanied them as planned.

Attempts locally to further identify Mr. LIF

(phonetic) and Mr. and Mrs. TONG were

rion-productive.
