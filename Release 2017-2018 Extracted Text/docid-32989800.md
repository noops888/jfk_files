however, he indicated he knew a Mr. LOBER. MEDAN suggested

that BERKMAN check to determine if the party she mentioned was

identical with LOBER. (S)

On the same date I-I learned

that MEDAN had

again contacted his office in New York and during his

discussion the telephone number UNiversity 5-7009 had

had asked for such a number or whether he had instructed

that this number be contacted. MIDAN inquired whether

Miss BERKNAN knew with whom he was in contact the same day

RIVKA, possibly HEDAN's wife, "get the private address and

sent it here".

MEDAN requested she cale it to lashington, D. C
