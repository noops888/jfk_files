MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

VIA:

Director of Training and Education

Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

FROM:

Kenneth McDonald

Chief, CIA History Staff

SUBJECT:

Survey of CIA's Records from House Select

Committee on Assassinations Investigation

As you requested on 16 January, the History Staff has

noW

surveyed CIA's records from the House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA) investigation into the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy.

As promised in my 30 January

interim report,

I can now

give you a full account of our

findings, and of my recommendation for transferring this HSCA

collection at its existing classification to the National

Archives through CIA's Historical Review Program.

2.

After the Office of Congressional Affairs arranged

permission from Congress for History Staff access to the

sequestered 64 boxes of this collection, we examined these and

other related holdings at Headquarters

and the(

Records Center.

As a result of careful, persistent, and

determined inquiries, we are fairly confident-although by no

means certain--that we have seen all the documents

that CIA

collected for the HSCA investigation of 1977-1979.

The summary

of our findings which follows is documented in more detail in

attachments A and B.

3.

General Description: The ISCA collection (defined as

all records that the

CIA provided to that Committee for its

1977-1979 investigation) is a large and chaotic collection.

Beyond the 64 boxes sequestered by Congress that have been

involved in FOIA litigation, there are 16 boxes of Oswald's 201

file and numerous loose folders (mainly from Mexico City

Station records) that were collected for the Warren Commission

investigation.

Most of this material can be found on microfilm

in the sequestered collection.

Of the 64 boxes, 34 have

material collected

by the Directorate of Operations, while

CL BY 0986542

SECRET

29 contain records from the Office of Legislative Counsel (now

OCA), Inspector General, Office of the General Counsel,

Directorate of Science

and Technology, Office of Security, as

well as several boxes of HSCA staff notes and records.

BOX No.

64 contains 72 microfilm reels (each equivalent to a box of

records), which include the Oswald 201 file and Mexico City

Station records, as

well as other 201 files and information

about Cuban exile groups.

4. Organization:

The collection is arranged haphazardly,

having been gathered in response to a series of HSCA and

(in

the case of

the Oswald 201 file) Warren Commission requests.

Although portions of the collection are organized by a variety

of systems, there is no overall intellectual control of the

entire body of records.

We found fifteen indexes to the

collection, none of which is adequate for control or retrieval.

5.

Sensitivity: Although the collection is almost

entirely at SECRET or lower classification, there is a

scattering of TOP SECRET and codeword documentation.

Materials

we consider especially sensitive--more for privacy than

national security reasons--include 201 files, phone taps, mail

intercepts, security files, photo surveillance, names of

sources, watch lists, and MHCHAOS documentation. Such material

occurs

throughout the collection, usually in response to HSCA

requests for name traces.

There

are 22 microfilm reels of 201

files in addition to the

Oswald file, while eight boxes contain

security records, including, for example, files on David Atlee

Phillips, Martin

Luther King, and Clay Shaw.

6. Non-CIA Material: The collection includes a lot of

third-agency material, mostly from the FBI. FBI reports

dominate the 16 boxes

of Oswald's 201 file, and nearly halt of

the 34 boxes of DO-collected material consists of third-agency

material.

The collection's remaining 29 boxes contain mostly

CIA records, as does the box of microfilm, except for Oswald's

201 tile.

There is also some documentation of foreign liaison,

mainly with the Mexican government.

7. CIA Complicity?

Our survey

found nothing in these

records that indicates any CIA role in the Kennedy

assassination or assassination conspiracy (if there was one),

or any CIA involvement with Oswald. These records do reveal,

however, that Clay Shaw was a highly paid CIA contract source

until 1956. While nothing surfaced on Carlos Marcello in the

collection, we found substantial documentation on other members

of the mob, including Santos Trafficante.

8.

Although the results of our

survey fully support my

earlier recommendation against inviting a panel of historians

2

SECRET

.:.,

SECRET

into CIA to examine and report on this collection, the problem

that this proposal addressed

remains--the widespread

allegations, given new impetus by Oliver Stone's "JFK," that

CIA was part of a conspiracy

to assassinate President Kennedy.

That CIA has a closed collection of records concerning the

Kennedy assassination is well known, both because it is part of

over 800 cubic feet of HSCA investigation records that Congress

has closed until 2029, and because our 64 boxes of these

records have been the

subject of FOIA requests, litigation, and

court orders. Since opening all US Government records on

the

Kennedy assassination has been

proposed by former President

Ford, Congressman Louis Stokes, and others, many observers will

consider your decision on this

question a test of your new

openness policy.

9.

Options: CIA's three principal options are to keep the

Agency's HSCA records closed and in our hands, to open them

entirely, or to transfer them to the National

Archives. Before

making my case for the third option, I should note the

following considerations with respect to the first two:

To maintain the status quo would keep the

classified, closed and in CIA's hands,

sequestered by Congress until 2029. CIA would, however,

remain subject to the 1988 court order to review portions

of it in response to FOIA litigation.

While putting the

collection into Historical Review Program processing would

speed and broaden its declassification

review (which would

nevertheless take several years), such an internal shift

would probably not change the public perception of our

closed position.

Although keeping these records closed

remains a viable option, it tends both to encourage

suspicion that CIA is part of a cover-up, and to undermine

the credibility of CIA's openness policy. If Congress

should decide to open all HSCA records, however, CIA would

be hard put to keep its HSCA collection closed.

b. Opened:

To open the HSCA collection would require the

permission of Congress. Indeed, CIA would presumably not

consider this option except in response to congressional

action or pressure, or in order not to be the last hold-out

in a Government-wide opening of Kennedy assassination

records.

good deal of information that deserves continued protection. ...

for privacy or national security reasons, a total release

would dramatically demonstrate CIA's new openness, and

rapidly reveal that these records

contain nothing pointing

to a CIA role in the Kennedy assassination.

10. Recommendation:

I recommend that CIA transfer its

entire HSCA collection (as defined and identified in this

report) at its existing classification to the National Archives

and Records Administration (NARA), for continuing

declassification review by Archives staff, in accordance with

the relevant laws, regulations and CIA guidelines.

transfer should be carried out under the auspices of CIA's

Historical Review Program.

To retire this HSCA collection to

the National Archives offers some significant advantages:

a .

It would get the collection off our hands.

Retiring

the records to the National Archives, which is by law the

eventual repository for all permanent IS Government

records, should reduce public suspicion of a CIA cover-up.

a transfer would not set a new precedent, since CIA

has previously retired over 4000 cubic feet of Office of

Strategic Services operational records to NARA, as well as

all CIA records so far declassified under the Agency's

Historical Review Program.

Although CIA has not previously

transferred classified records to NARA, the transfer of

this HSCA collection, resulting from a congressional

investigation, follows the special precedent of the

classified CIA documents retired to NARA's vaults as part

of the records of the Watergate and Iran-Contra

investigations.

b.

Transferring these HSCA records to the National

Archives will protect their existing classification.

The

Departments of State and Defense have routinely retired

classified records to NARA for years.

In accordance with

statutory guidelines, NARA must ensure the confidentiality

of investigatory sources and the proper protection of

personal privacy and national security information,

including

intelligence sources and methods. NARA would

continue the court-ordered declassification review

according to CIA guidelines.

CIA can accelerate the

declassification of this collection by funding review

positions at NARA, as the Department of State and other

agencies have done in the past. (Attachment C outlines

declassification procedures for classified records retired

to the National Archives.)

c.

NARA's professional archivists will bring this

collection under control (as they have done with the 4000

cubic feet of disorganized OSS records that CIA has retired

since 1984), so that it can be usefully researched as it is

declassified. Moreover, many of the records in this

collection (especially photographs, carbon flimsies, and

Thermofax) need expert preservation, which NARA is

organized to provide.

d. If Congress should eventually undertake to open this

entire collection without regard to classification, the

National Archives will be in

a stronger position to protect

its national security and privacy information than the CIA,

whose motives would appear self-serving, if not sinister.

11. Action: If you wish to retire the Agency's. House

Select Committee on Assassinations collection to the National

Archives, the following

actions (from

the offices noted) will

be needed:

Request permission from Congress. (Office of

Congressional Affairs)

Transfer responsibility for court-ordered FOIA

declassification review from CIA to the National Archives.

(Office of the General Counsel, with Information Management

Staff, DO)

Prepare CIA guidelines for NARA's declassification

review. (Office of Information Technology, DA)

₫. Prepare the appropriate Historical Review Program

documentation and NARA forms, and deliver the records.

(Office of Information Technology, DA)

Announce the transfer jointly with DI. Don Wilson,

Archivist of the United States, and Congressman Louis

Stokes.

SUMMARY

CIA HISTORY STAFF SURVEY

House Select Committee on Assassinations Collection

10 February 1992

The House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

Collection consists of the following parts, which the attached

box list describes in further detail:

1. Sequestered HSCA Records

The first and major part of

the collection,

64 boxes of records under Job No. 80-T01357A,

is wide-ranging material collected in response to House Select

Committee on Assassinations requests for documents relating to

the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and, to a far

lesser extent, Dr. Martin Luther King. Coordinated by the

Office of Legislative Counsel (now the Office of Congressional

Affairs) and now under OCA control, these are the "sequestered"

boxes that have been the subject of FOlA litigation and court

order.

a .

Boxes 1-34: DO Boxes 1-34 (34 cu. ft. of records) are

about one-half DO-collected materials, with the remainder

largely of third agency documents, primarily FBI reports

gathered for the Warren Commission.

There is also some

material from the Department of State and the Immigration

and Naturalization Service, as well as the original SCA

requests.

Also included are staff handwritten notes,

photographs, and copies of newspaper clippings. These

records cover a wide variety of topics but focus on CIA

operations against Cuba and Castro, Lee Harvey Oswald's

sojourn in the USSR, Oswald's activities in Mexico City and

New Orleans, and a large number of name traces requested by

the HSCA staff.

There is also material on the Black

Panthers, the civil rights movement, and the peace

movement.

Among the subjects that appear in

these boxes

are:

Jack Ruby, Clay Shaw, Frank Sturgis, E. Howard Hunt,

Nosenko, Guy Bannister, David Ferrie, Silvia

Duran, Martin

Luther King, Coretta Scott King, James Eard Ray, William

Kunstler, Jim Garrison, G. P. Hemming, Marina Oswald, John

a ..

Roselli, Sam Giancana,

Santos Trafficante, and Rolando

Cubela's AMLASH operations against Castro. These records

also include the 1967 Inspector General's report on CIA

plots against Castro and the testimony of Richard Helms in

executive session before HSCA.

b. Boxes 35-63 Boxes 35 through 63 in this job (29 cu.

Ft. of records) are equally eclectic, divided as they are

between records from the Office of Legislative Counsel (now

OCA), Inspector General, Office of the General Counsel,

Directorate, of Science

and Technology, Office of Security

(security files), and the HSCA itself. These records,

which are mostly CIA material (heavily DO), consist of

reports, memoranda, transcripts, cables, letters, newspaper

clippings, photographs, and charts.

They include materials

relating to the Garrison investigation, Watergate, Cuban

exile activities, and CIA attempts to assassinate Fidel

Castro.

There is also some material relating to Martin

Luther King, black power, and racial violence, as well as a

DS&T report on photos of the "unknown man" at the Mexico

City Soviet embassy, and an NPIC analysis of the Zapruder

film.

c. Box 64: Microfilm Box 64 of Job. No. 80-T01357A

contains 72 reels of microfilm (although the box is labeled

"CIA/DDO HSCA Records, box 1 of 2," box 2 has not been

found) •

The History Staff was assured, however, that this

was indeed box

64 of Job No. 80-T01357A. In addition to a

copy of Oswald's 201 file (as actually shown to the HSCA

staff in 1978), the microfilm contains material on Oswald's

activities in Mexico City (primarily photographic and phone

tap surveillance of the Soviet and Cuban embassies and

consulates), Mexico City Station files (including cable

traffic and the station's "p" Personality files), CIA

security files, Nosenko interrogation transcripts, and a

great deal of information relating to Cuban exile

groups•

There are also 22 reels of 201 files, which contain 151

individual files.

Some of the material on these microfilm

reels reproduces DO material in the boxes, although it is

difficult to judge exactly how much.

Oswald's 201 File The second part of the HSCA

collection is Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file, 16 boxes (16 cu.

ft. of records) held in the DO's Information Management Staff

(IMS) •

This file consists primarily of copies of FBI reports

relating to Oswald, FBI investigations on Oswald and his

activities (including items that FBI sent CIA prior to the

assassination), interviews with Marina Oswald, Department of

State cable traffic concerning Oswald's passport and visa

applications, information tracing Oswald's weapons, material on.....

Jack Ruby and Silvia Duran, and a tape of Oswald's August 1963

radio debate. There are also detailed FBI reports concerning

Oswald's assassination of the President and his contacts with

Soviet officials, as well as records relating to Gilberto

Alvarado, who maintained that he witnessed Cubans passing

Oswald cash at a party on the night before the assassination.

3.

Loose Files The HSCA collection's third part comprises

a number of loose folders that evidently belong within the

collection, including eight bulky Mexico City Station files

(including cable traffic and "p" files) that are also in the

microfilm.

These files are considered to be part of the Oswald

201 file and are held in IMS.

group

of 16 tile folders that

appear to be unaccessioned contain a miscellany of HSCA

requests and Agency responses on subjects such as Oswald in the

USSR, Marina Oswald,

достав

Roselli, and Giancana. These appear to

belong with Job. No. 80-T01357A.

4..

Organization Partly because of the collection's

origins in the disorderly process of the Agency's response to

massive investigatory committee requests, the collection badly

organized. Moreover, years of working through these files in

response

Freedom of Information Act requests have

disrupted the collection further.

More importantly, however,

the Agency has not taken intellectual control of the collection

in the fifteen years since it was created. Partial systems of

organization have been imposed upon various parts of the.

collection without reference to or use of sound archival

principles and procedures.

Although 15 separate (and

unsatisfactory) indexes to the collection eventually surfaced,

the lack of any central index or finding aid makes retrieval of

individual documents extremely difficult. Although CIA review

officers attempted to impose some order to the collection by

numbering each document and adding a folder numbering system to

each box, there is no central control or finding aid for any of.

these these systems.

Provenance cannot be traced, and entire

files are missing that cannot be satisfactorily accounted for.

5.

Non-record Copies This collection consists for the

most part of xeroxed copies rather than original documents. We-

suspect that the originals of many, if not most, of these

xeroxed documents would be difficult if not impossible to

locate.

6.

Preservation Much of the material throughout the

collection,

especially thermofax copies and photos, is fragile

and in

poor physical condition, requiring immediate

attention

to prevent further deterioration.

NOTES ON TRANSFER TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES

AND DECLASSIFICATION OF CIA RECORDS

10 February 1992

1. Transfer CIA would transfer documents under their

existing classification to the National Archives and Records

Administration (NARA) in much the

transfers declassified documents.

Using a NARA Form 258, the

usual transfer document, CIA would note that the documents to be

transferred are classfied.

These records would then go into

secure NARA vaults, where

they would be accessible only to

archivists with appropriate security clearances.

Codeword

documents would go into a compartmented vault under the direct

control of the Records Declassification Division, to be processed

only by reviewers with the necessary SCI access approvals.

Classification Any transfer of CIA records to NARA under

existing classification would provide continuing security

protection for these documents consistent with Agency standards..

In accordance with statutory guidelines. NARA must ensure the

confidentiality of investigatory sources and the proper protection

of personal privacy as well as national security information,

including intelligence sources and methods.

3 .

Declassification

Declassification guidelines would be a

matter for negotiation between the CIA and NARA.

Some agencies

(e. g. the Department of Defense) give general guidance,

while

others (e.g. the Department of State) offer more specific

guidelines. Although specific guidelines require more effort..to...

develop, NARA prefers them to more general guidelines, since under

1 guidelines

specific instructions NARA's reviewers find less need

for referral

back to the donor agency.

4. Funding and Resources Funding and resources would also be

matter for negotiation between the Agency and NARA. The

Department of State and the Agency for International Development

(AID), for example, have funded a certain number of reviewer

. .....

positions, while NARA funds all overseer positions (both reviewers

and overseers are NARA employees). For consistency and quality

control NARA does two reviews for

State and AID. State's own

staff members then do a final quality check--in effect

a third

review-of the product at NARA.

State and

AID consider their

review guidelines to be draft guidance until they review the

CL BY 0986542

SECRET

DECL OADR

SECRET

results. They then redraft the guidance, as necessary.

In the

past, this has meant only fine-tuning the guidelines, which are

then applied to the next group of records, rather than a re-review

of those already processed.

5.

Preservation

CIA's records from the House Select

Committee on Assassinations investigation are in poor physical

condition and have distinct preservation needs.

The collection

contains large quantities of fragile and deteriorating documents

including thermofax copies and photographs, which NARA is in a far

better position to care for properly than is CIA.
