A Renewal

of LIENVOY

ALTON RIQUIRIO- SPILELMAS

Project

LIENVOY 10 due for renewl on l February 1988.

Would you please

let us have a renewel request by I January 1968.

?.

LIENVOY was. estimated at $57,000 in our recent FY 1968

program exercise, so we must ask that

you stay within this figure

in the renewal.

If you will be necding replacements for equipment

for the Lp, would it be possible to reallocate funds previously

budgeted for LISALAD and for "purchase of information" to cover

the cost of such procurement?:

3.

Headquarters appreciates the carefully detailed renovale

which you prepare on LIENVOY because they give such a good picture of

what the project produces.

Could you also loclude in the current

renewal a brief description of the center and the equipment and

how the management of the daily routine is shared beteeen AREMART

and his Mexican colleagues?

PROJECT BRIEFING

PROJECT: LIENVOY

WH - Mexico

ACTION : ADD/P. approval of renewal

1 Feb 67 • 31 Jan 68

PURPOSE: Project supports a joint CIA-Moxican Government telephone

tap unit and a non-official liaison relationship

PROGRESS: During the past year covered a total of 30 telephone linea :

simultancously providing 8, 6tt reels of raw take. Of the 30

lines, at least 15 of them are exclusively for Station targets

and the remaining targets are chosen by the Mexican authorities

but are usually of intercat to the Station. Station targels include

the Cuban Embassy, the Soviet Embassy, Czech Embassy,

•Polish Embassy and the New China News Agency

FI/INT files contain 107 positive intelligence reports produced

during the review period. This production, although unavoidably

uneven in quality and coverage, included a considerable amount

of useful information relevant to priority needs of the community.

LIENVOY coverage of Cuban and Soviet installationg has been

of particular usefulness as a check on Station operations. A

get of voice samples of Soviot officials has been collected which

assists the identification of unidentified speakers elsewhere.

The channel established

Chester D. DAINOLD (p) and in consequence closer co-

operation betveen the Government of Mexiço and the U.S.

Government and CIA in particular.

23 February 1967

Project LIENVOY -- Renewal Period 1 February 1037 - 31 January 1963

Comments and Recommendations (To be forwarded to the Division)

1. Our files contain 107 positive intelligence reports produced wholly

or in part by LIENVOY and disseminated in the period 1 February 1200 - 31.

January 1907.

Over half of this production (60 reports) dealt with pians and

activities of Mexican Communists and other leftiste. Included were 17

reports which provided useful information on the unrest at the National

Autonomous University. (UNAVi) and other universities. As our recent

study of reporting on Mexico indicates, student unrest has been a subject

of high interest to the community. Also included were 13 dissemiistions

which contributed to the station's coverage, highly praised by all customers,

of leftist activities in connection with President Johnson's visit. The oiher

30 reports in this group, primarily concorning the ECM, MUN, and PPS,

varied considerably in quality but in general appeared to be oi moderate

value in relation to customer needs.

2. The disseminated production from forsign Communist installations

was relatively meager. There were 9 reports on relations with the Soviets,

mostly on cultural programs; 3 reports on commercial negotiations with

Czechoslovakia and Poland; 7 reports concerned with Cuba; and & reports

on Chicom (NCNA) activities in Mexico.

With the possible exception ot

information on Vexican-Bloc trade -- a subject of inuch interest to ORR --

the LIENVOY coverage of official Communist installations did not provide

positive intelligence of any great significance. Motably lacking was iniorma

tion on ioreign subversive efforts against Mexico, for which customers lave

expressed an urgent need.

3. The rest of the production for the perio included the follewing:

9 reports concerning Guatemalan exile activity, nich appeared to te of

value; 9 reports on activities of the press secretary of the Presidencia which

contributed to covcrage of the government's pians and activities... at area

on which the community has a high priority need for information; and one

report concerning initiatives for a Vietnamese peace which was disseminated

as an Intelligence Information Special Report to the Director.

There were

also 4 reports on right-wing Sinarchist activity, a subject of relatively

little interest to customers.

.. In summary, the positive intelligence production as a wiole,

thour: navoidably teren in is quality and coverage, included a consideradle

amoir of useful information relevant to priority needs of the cominunity.

While this disseminata: produc: in itself would hardly justify the total cost

of the project,

we assume that a substantial portion oi the cost is warranted

for purposes other then collector of positive information. Consequently

Renewal of the LIENVOY Project

L...-

Renewal is requested of the LIENVOY Project

for the period 1 February

1967

through 31 January

1968

for a total of $57,100, with $22,170 for FY

1967

included

In the 1967 Operational Program for.

$50,000 .

The additional funds roqulred for FY

1967 are

available within Wi Division.

2.

The LIENVOY Project covers both access to

high lovel Mexican Government officials

and a joint telephone tap operation

3.

The phone taps produce FI, CE, and operational

support information.

According to

Headquarters

records, during the period 1 February through 31

December 1966, LIENVOY was the source of ninety-eight

positive intelligence reports, seventy-nine of which

were disseminated.

These reports covered the follow

ing general subject categories:

Soviet Embassy

activities in Mexico,

Mexican Communist Party activi

ties, Communist front activities,

the activities of

the Chicom representatives in Mexico, and the

activittes

of various

extremist groups.

Included in

this reporting was that prior

to and during President

Johnson's trip

to Mexico City

in April 1966.

The

Station's reporting on this trip, which included

LIENVOY, was highly praised by the customers.

LIENVOY

also Frovided some good coverage during

the trouble

at the Natlonal Autonomous

University (UNAM) in the

spring and useful information during disturbances at

some of the other universities.

The romainder of the

LIENVOY coverage couid be considered of medium-level

interest and value.

and soviet installations, was useful as a check on

the Station's operations.

It furnished information

on double agents directed against the Soviets, for

instance,: and on several agents in contact with the

Cuban

which pormits the identification

of unidentified speakers on other coverage. for

example,

recently in LIFEAT a man speaking with

Suzie PIERRE Charles, i Haitian Communist. was

Identified as Vladinir Ivanovich SHPAKEVICH (KGB) .

LIENVOY is also che principal source of intormation

on the travel of Sovicts within Mexico and abroad.

The Station has a standing requirement for informing

the Office of the logal Attache in Mexico of all

travel performed by Soviet officials within the

Republic

of Mexico, and LIENVOY helps the Station

to fulfill this request.

monitor all telephone calls recelved on all 30 lines.

This monitoring

1s only to determine the importance of the call and in order to make

notco and a log for the transcribers. This serves two purposes.

First, any extremoly valunble Information can be detected imediately

and action can be taken by the Station or the Mexicans with no time

InE. Secondly, it askas the work of the transcribers much easier.

They must process all the tacos overnight so that a briefing paper 1s

•on the

dest the next morning outlining all informatien of

value reccived the mevious dey through the telephone intercepts.

The

Station has rehired LrivUY-8 at a salary of $240/monch.

Comments and Recommendations (To go coward to the Division)

1. FLINT/RE files contin li: positive intelligence

disseminations prodiced by Project LIENVOY and disseminated

during the period 1 rebruary 1900 and 5l January 1900. The

bulk o: the reporting dealt with the Commmist Party of Moxico

or Communist front activities. There was also ruperting on

activities o: Chinese Communist, Cuband, Soviets, and Easteen

European oricinis in Mexico. A handiul of reports dealt with

Mexican rightists of the National Sinarchist Union.

2. Wide reporting from this type dt operation la necessarily

uneven in quality, the production in general provided valuable

information on netivities of aubveroive groups and other political

elements which appose the uresent type of governon in Moxico.

It is our opinion thai LIENVOY coverage of internal subversive

activities has shoved considerable improvement over previous

B. CHANGES

(1) Opcrational Mechanica

The LIENVOY Project was crented in late 1958 and put into operation in

carly 1959 at the request of LITENSOR who appointed LIELEGANT so his special

assistant to work with willard C. CURTIS in the supervialon and adminintration of

the project.

In mid-1Jós lt become coldent that LIFAMA would replace LITENSOR In

December 196k.

(LIRAMA was then LITtViO-2 and: a clandestine Ilalson contact with

Willard C. CURTIS under the LITEMPO Project but was not knowledgeable of the

CURTIS/LIELEGAT/LITENSOR reladlonuhly in Project. LIFNVOY.) On 10 August 1964

LIRAMA (LITEMPO-2) nuked CUNIIS and LIELEGANI for a conference (reported to Head-

quarters in MEXI-0521 dated 10 August 1964).

At thio meeting, LIRAMA novised that

LITENSOR had briefed him on sie LIETVOX Project In detall and that it should be

continued with the same persennel and unner of operation.

LIENVOY agents.

Arnold F. AREKART,

Sraff Agent, has been responelble for malrten-.

ance of the technical eufppent for the past five years. His work continuco to

be outstanding and accounts for the fact that after almost six years' use, the

equipnent is in sood working order and has sustained a minirum of loes tbrough

negligent breckage or theft (both very common in Mexico).

There has been no major

mechanicul breakdown since AREHART has been supervising the maintenance of the

eguipment.

C..

G. URQUHART (ps), presently 1a Mexico on temporary duty has

provided the Station with the rollowing evaluation of the LIENVOY

product:

"The LIENVOY production on the Cuban Embassy traffic In

Mexico. City hes been one of the basic elements contributing to the

success of the AMHOD operatlor, airected agains: the CUIS for CA

purposes.

Ice LIENVOY operation

has been of value In two general

senses:

The documentary material derived from the texts has

formed core of the

basis for reconstruction of historical facts

needed for the operation.

b.

The day to day coverage has enabled

thie case officer on

the AMROD operatior. to

cense the climate inside

the target, to keep track of the movenents of key opposition personnel,

to check on the bona fides oi certain esents, to check the wori of

others for veracity and to live monitor portions of the reactions

to the AMROD operation Itsclf.

Beire nble to keep track of the

chifts and movements of the opposition and their personal relations

has been of vital importance to this operation.

On two occasiors

the AMROD Case Officer also used the LIEVOY base as his command

post when engineering personal contacts between a KBARK staffer

and the opposition.

This type of close support did much to determine

the success of those mectings and contributed grently to the success

of the operation.

These transcripts provide one of the best sounding

boards for the AMROD operation and are regularly forwarded to re at

Headquarters."

The six lines abore are rulig transcribed by ILENVOY transcribers

and delivered by AREllART to RIGGS each morning.

Lengthy conversa-

tions sometimes require an adiltional, day for transcription. A

carbon copy is pouched weekly to leedquarters for lili/SA use.

In the intercept center chronological files. LIRWA does not read

these transcripts unless some siniticant Item appears in

which causes him to ask for a fuller cranscript or listen

to the tape.

The coverage of this target also yields a good picture of duily

nctivitles, restiences, personal habiüs and weaknesses of Cubun

official personnel in Mexico.

In sclection of targets for recmiltment and in checking on activitles
