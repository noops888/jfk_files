The three individuals began discussing the

JOSaPH VALACHI story which is currently appearing in

the newspapers and GLEASON was of the opinion that

VALACHI's testimony was all nearsay, and that nothing

woula come out of it. However, NOONAN offered to bet

GLEASON that more than one indictment "comes out" of

the VALACHI

testimony.

GLEASON remarked "what do

those guys care about that" referring to members of

Cosa Nostra. NOONAN indicated it would "eost those

guys a fartune", and to which GLEASON remarked "they.

got it."

TEDDY GLEASON then remarked that TOMMY

(GLEASON, JR.) is going to sue the Waterfront Commission,

the newspaper, and all the writers for the story that

appeared in the papers concerning allegations that TOMMY

GLEASON has profited from ILA business because of his

father, TEDDY GLEASON.

TEDDY GLEASON remarked that a

Lawyer

can"t be "schmeared", and TOMMY is not going to

take it.

AUSTIN FUREY then asked GLEASON when GLEASON

was taking over the Presidency of the ILA.

GLEASON

remarked he was taking over Friday night (8/16/63).

'GLEASON also remarked that the ILA is $1,234,000 in the

a place to go". AUSTIN FUREY questioned whether GLEASON

was going to Washington, and GLEASON indicated "no", and

that he was going to talk to the executive board Fa day

about that.

It is noted that NY 4091-PC has advised that

GLEASON apparently is going to ignore the resolution

passed at the ILA convention to move the headquarters

of the thA from New York to washington, D. C. NY 4091-P0

further advised that GLEASON,

• JOHN BOWERS and FRED FIELD,

newly elected Executive Vice-President and Geral Organizer,

respectively, had been looking over rental space at 17

Battery Place, in an apparent attempt to lease space

there

for the ILA.
