owed TROMBERI. RIPEPI is fighting extradition to Maryland

from Pennsylvania and no decision has yet been rendered by

Pennsylvania courts.

The listed members and suspected members of the

and JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI have any indication of being engaged

in any illegal activities during the past several years.

their movements are restricted by their afflictions and

old 'age. JOSEPH CORBI operates a pizza business which is

owned by himself and FRANK CORBI, and he is not known to

engage in any illegal activities. JOE TAMBURELLO,

of a small neighborhood grocery store, devotes most of his

time to operating this business. CHARLES BARBERA and JAMES

ROMANO, both barbers, show no sign of any 1llegal

but spend most of their time at their businesses.
