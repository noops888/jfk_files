PRESS BRIEFING GROUP

REQUEST TO INTERVIEW DIRECTOR

NOVEMBER 18, 1964

3.

#MDR16

Sarah McClendon called late in the aiternoon of November 4,

1964, and said that for some time she and Helene Monberg had been lining up

"press briefings" for various women correspondents here in Washington. She

said this is an informal group and that 5 to 20 women correspondents usually

participate in these press briefings. Miss McClendon said that their group

contacts prominent Washington leaders and then arranges to have the members

meet in the individual's office and spend approximately one hour questioning

them on their responsibilities, current problems of interest, etc. Miss McClendon

said that recently their group of women correspondents met with Republican

Chairman Burch and with Democratic Chairman Bailey.

Miss McClendon

inquired whether it might be possible for the Director to be host to their group

for about one hour on November 18. 1964, and if that date was not possible she

would like to arrange for her group to meet the Director on some following

week for about an hour's quizzing.

Miss McClendon was advised regarding the very heavy nature:

of the Director's commitments and the fact that it was extremely difficult for

him to set up arrangements for a briefing of this type in view of the emergency

nature of our business. Miss McClendon said she fully understood the problems

but asked that her request for a press briefing for her group of women correspond

ents be brought to Mr. Hoover's atte

RECOMMENDATION:

INTERVIEW OF THE DIRECTOR

NOVEMBER 18, 1964

011/00

I talked with Miss McClendon this afternoon and she advised that

right now she feels the group which will come in to interview the Director will

number "close to 25." I asked her to let me know as soon as possible when her

list of acceptances was completed and Miss McClendon promised to call me back.

Earlier Miss Monberg had sent over an alphabetical list of all

the female correspondents who belonged to this briefing group.

There are 41

names on this list. Miss McClendon knows that some of these ladies are going

to be involved in other assignments or out of town; however, we are getting up

a brief run-down on each of the women correspondents whose name appears of

attached list.

In talking with Miss McClendon, I explained to her that the ladies

must fully understand that some of the Director's comments may have to be

"off the record." Miss McClendon said her group fully realizes this, that they

have run into this situation before and that quite naturally they will abide by any

"off the record" answers. Miss McClendon said she did hope that the bulk of the

briefing would be "on the record',' and I assured her that this would be the case.

The above is for the Director's information.

RACIAL SITUATION, Albany, Ga.,

'/RACIAL_HATTERS (Article by

Martin Luther King,

critical of rBI) lilli

i: 12l1|00

SPZALm)7.TG

Reference is made to the memorandum from Mx. Rosen to

Mx. Belmont, 11/20/62 (copy attached), referring to the article

Oi hev. Martin Luther king, or, criticizing the work of the FBI

in relation to the Albany situation.

The question has been raised

to whether we should not try to talk to king and set him straight

as to the Bureau's approach and activities.

At the outset, it's

should be stated that it is questionable

whether an interview with King will be fruitful. We have picked u›

information in the past that king admits to being a Marxist, but

cannot afioid to admit this publicly. We know of his close tie-in

with Hunter Pitts Odell, a member of the National Committee of the

Communist Party, and we

have seen various instances where King received

advice and his actions were apparently controlled at least to some

extent, by the Communist Party.

on the other hand, we do know that king has been in touch

with the Attorney General from time to time, and in view of the

public image he has built up as a Negro leader he may fancy himseli

as a leader using the assistance of, but independent of, the Communist

I Party.

(1) Ir. Deloach feels that it would be desirable to interview

King.

He recommends that he and Assistant Director Sullivan jointly

interview King.

He feels that two Bureau representatives should

interview King in

order that there will be a witness and there can

be no charge of provincialism inasmuch as Deloach comes irom the

South and lir. Sullivan comes from the North.

911 - 33

(2) Mr. Sullivan feels that King should

be interviered. He

feels, however, that if two Bureau representatives approach King,

King

Will be immediately on the defensive and no progress will be made.

He feels that king should be intervieved, initially, on a broad basis,

m:6285T DAd: 30989674 Page 9

## Page 10

Fasten thine

..=C

Mr. Tolson

showing the Bureau's understanding of the racial and sociological

problems of the legro, and thereafter the Bureau's position should

be built into this irame of reference. He believes that either

Mr. DeLoach or himself should undertake the interview, individually.

(3) Mr. Sullivan suggests a third alternative. He is very

vell acquainted vith DI. Douglas jackson, a well known sociologist (whire)

a member of the faculty of Southern lethodist University in

Dallas. Di. Jackson is inown'to Sullivan as a man thoroughly and

soundly interested in solving the racial question in the South.

He

is well known in different Negro areas for the stand that he has taken

and he is respected by them.

Additionally, Dr. Jackson has been quite

interested in the work of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

of which King is president.

Jackson has told Sullivan, as recently as a week and a balf

ago in Indianapolis, that if he at any time can do anything which

would assist the FBI he should simply make the request of him. Sullivan

believes we should also give consideration to having Dr. Jackson

approach king and discuss this whole matter with him very thoroughly,

from a racial and sociological point of view, and ultimately clarify

in this discussion King's ideas on the FBI, and lay the groundwork

for King's support of the rBI.

Sullivan would be perfectly willing

to brief

Jackson on this entire matter and set the machinery in

motion, if it is so desired.

-

RECONMENDATION:

The above three courses of action are set forth 'for the

Director's consideration.

I personally favor #2.

officers in official pesformance of their duties and he is presently out on bond

awaiting rodral Croad Jury actoi. These two Agents were both born, reared

and educated in the North.

Dr. Bing also asserts, "One of the great problems we fece with

the FBI in the fouth is that the agents are mite Southerners who have been

influenced by the morcs of the co maunity," mis solution "was for the federal

government to concader assigning agents from other parts of the country to the

Couth and "who are at least in agruement with the law of the land,'" according

to the newpaper article.

While ZBI Agents throughout the country carry out their investi-

gative reponsibilities irrespective di their state oi origin, four out of the five

Agents assigned to ine Albany, Georgia, Reaident Agency come from states

other thon Goorgia--How York, Indiana, Waacachusetts and stinnesota.

ine other statements by ur. sing revea a total ignorance, not

only of the true charecter of I'di Director. Sugar Hoover, but also of the Fbi

record in protecting civil rights.

As an oxample of merely one aspect of our exiensive operations

in the civil righto fiold, I cite the natter of voting. In the past severai months,

the FBI has conducted investigations involving more than 100 counties in which

racial diocrimination was alleged to exist. The Deportment of Justice has been

furnished the results of these investigations; and based upon them, over 30

suits in counties of live states have been filed by the Department for the purpose

of ending racial discrimination in voting.

As a recult of FEI investigations and court actions based thereon,

thousands of previoualy disentranchised Negroes have been enabled to register

to vote in accordance with their rights under the Constitution andlaws of the

United states.

For esample, in one area thore no Nero had voted in 40 years,

Negroes entered polling places in September, 1962, and cast kallots.

It should always be borne in mind that the BI is strictly an

investigative agency. Our invertipations are conductod with dispatch and

thoroughness.

Contrary to many baliets, va do not render prosecutive opinions

nor handle the prosecution of cases. This, of course, is proper in a Republic

such as ours.

expressed much admiration for the Director and the FBI. He was congratulated

by the Director when he was elected President of the National Newspaper Pub-

lishers Association in 1960. SAs Joseph II. Q'Rourke and Paul J. Mohr were

the Agents assaulted by Virgil idmund Puckett, and this case is being closely

rollowed by the General investigative Division. In June, 1962, Sengstacke was

appointed to the President's Advisory Committee to end any discrimination

against military persennel and their families. In July, 1962, the White House

was furnished a copy of pertinent information in Bufiles regarding Sengstacke.

5P2 ALM HE

Mr. Belmont's memorandum of November 26, 1962, reflected the

alternatives in interviewing Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr..,

work of the FBI in relation to the Albany situation. The Director approved the

suggestion that Mr. Sullivan and I handle the interview with Rev. King.

Following approval, I immediately tried to contact Rev. King telephonically

on November 27, 1962.

'"":

Rev. King does not have a phone at his residence. We then attempt-d to

contact him at his church in Atlanta. His secretary advised, upon being told who

was trying to contact him, that Rev. King was "off in another building writing a book.

She further stated that Rev. King preferred not to be disturbed and that it would be

impossible to talk to him.

That same day I called the SAC at Atlanta and instructed

him to attempt to contact Rev. King and set up an interview for Mr. Sullivan and me.

/SAC Atlanta advised the following day, November 28, that Rev. King had left

instructions with his secretary that he did not have time for an interview, that he was

moving around the country. The secretary further advised the SAC that Rev. King

would call us when he was willing to sit down for an; interview. Rev. King has not

called since thai date.

It would appear obvious that Rev. King does not desire to be told the

¡true facts. He obviously used deceit, lies and treachery as propaganda to further

his own causes.

Realizing the above, I recommended, the Director approved, that I

talk with Mr. MacKay, publisher of the four Afro-American newspapers.

This

interview was handled and reported by memorandum. The interview was based on the

fact that the Afro-American newspapers had published Rev. King's lies, quoting

him exclusively. In talking with Mr. MacKay I carefully went over each allegation

by Rev. King and set him straight with respect to these lies.

MacKay offered no

The record concerning Rev. King's allegations has been covered.

Interviews with the publishers of the newspapers who carried Rev. King's lies

have been conducted and they have been set straight. I see no further need to

contacting Rev. King inasmuch as he obviously does not desire to be given the

MARTIN LUTHER KING

INFORMATION CONCERNING

An individual who identified himself as Dr. Andrew Young, Executive

Assistant to Martin Tuther King, called from New York City at 12:05 p.M. today and

asked to speak with me.

D.C

comer

DI. Young stated I probably knew what he was calling about. I told him

I did it he was calling with reference to Reverend King's request for an appointment

with Mr. Hoover. I mentioned that the Acting Attorney General had called this morning

about this matter and that I had just advised the Acting Attorney General that Mr. Hoover

would see Reverend King at 3:30 p.m. today. Dr. Young stated this would press them a

bit, however, he thought they could make it.

Di. Young stated that Reverend King wanted to talk about law

enforcement in the future. He stated they have several programs at Selma, Alabama,

and in the Blackbelt Countys surrounding Selma. He stated this might be a bad time for

Reverend King to be discussing matters; however, they feel that they have been negligent

in that they have contacted the Department in the past and have not set down with the FBI.

Dr. Young stated that Reverend King merely wanted to sit down with

Mr. Hoover and discuss matters. He stated that Reverend King did not desire to complain

but merely to find out what type of protection the FBI will offer Negro citizens when they

attempt to exercise their rights in the future. I interrupted Dr. Young at this point and

stated I felt certain that both he and Reverend King fully understood that the FBI did not

have the authority or jurisdiction to "protect" anyone and that if Reverend King was

seeking a change in policy in this regard he should talk to the Acting Attorney General anc

not Mir. Hoover. Dr. Young made no reference to this statement but spoke up again and

stated that there had been a breach and misunderstanding between Reverend King's

organization and the FBI in the past and that this was a matter they did not want to

encourage.

Re: Martin Luther King

Dr. Young assured me that Reverend King did not want to mention anything

that has come up in the past. He stated, as a matter of fact, people are harassing them

to death and they cannot get any work done in their office because they have to answer

questions concerning the FBI. He then added that Reverend King was mest anxious and

willing to meet with the Director and particularly wanted to do so before he departed for

Oslo, Norway

I interrupted Dr. Young again at'this point and told him that it was useless

for them to request a "peace meeting" with us as long as the crusade of defamation against

Mr. Hoover and tife FBI was to be carried on by Reverend King and his organization.

Dr. Young stated that he understood this. He stated that actually "they" feel that the FBI

has done a very sound investigative job. He added that the current misunderstanding is

something that should be cleared up. He then asked me if I knew of any conditions for

the meeting. I told him that the only condition desired was that there be an understanding

that the campaign of slander and defamation against the Director and the FBI by

Reverend King and his organization, behind our backs, be dropped. Dr. Young replied,

"yes." He then asked if there would be any objections if he and Reverend Abernathy

accompanied Reverend King. I told him there would be none. He asked again the time of

the appointment and I told him 3:30 p.m. today. He again stated that this would press

them, however, he thought they could make it.

Di. Young asked me if the FBI planned to make any announcement

concerning the meeting. I told him that we would make no announcement at this time.

He inquired as to whether Reverend King should make an announcement. I told him this

was entirely up to Reverend King.

At 12:25 p.m. today we received a call from the wire services indicating

that Bayard Rustin had just announced in New York that Reverend King would meet with

the Director at 3:30 p.m. this afternoon. It was quite obvious that this group already

had their press release prepared with the exception of the time element.

The following sets forth details of difficulties encountered in

attempts to contact Martin Luther King, JX."

The "New York Times" 17h49/62 quoted King to the effect that the

FBI had not done an effective. job in Albany, Georgia, and one of the great

problems with the Bureau in the South was that the Agents were white

Southerners. Actually, four of the five Agents assigned to Albany, Georgia,

were Northern born.

It was approved that Mr. Sullivan and Mr. DeLoach would make an

appointment vita king to straighten him out concerning the statements he

reportedly had made.

On 11/30/62 Mr. DeLoach attempted to contact King to arrange the

interview. The Atlanta operator advised there was no telephone at the

residence usually occupied by king and the operator then tried to reach

him at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Someone at the church

stated that King was on a two weeks vacation and could not be reached.

The Atlanta Office then was instructed to attempt to locate King

by telephone and advise him that Mr. DeLoach and MI. Sullivan wished to

sit down and have a chat with him any time he was in the Washington or

New York area.

King's secretary was then contacted by the Atlanta Office

on 11/30/62, and the secretary stated

that Kingwas at a hideaway writing a

book and could not be reached for the week of November 30.

The secretary

stated that the following week King would be travéling in Alabama.

secretary was requested to have King contact the Atlanta Office with regard

to an argent matter, however, RECZI

never made such a contact.

PRETENTE

Special Agent Charles S. Harding by. letter of 11/20/64 has

remarked that when he attempted to contact King to make the appointment for

Mr. DeLoach, King and his staff completely ignored the. FBI even though they

were advised the request to talk to him was a matter of utmost urgency.

RE :

DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN ATTEMPTING TO

CONTACT MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

On about July 18 to July 20, 1961, attempts were made to make

an appointment with King to interview

him in connection with the

investigation of Theodore Edward Brown who was under investigation as a

special inquiry for the Peace Corps. On July 19.or July 20, King's

secretary stated that "Dr. King can see you on Saturday afternoon but

you don't work Saturdays, do you?" His secretary was advised that the

Agent would be at king's office any time. King would be available.

detinite appointment was made for 2 p.m. Saturday afternoon July

22, 1961.

The Agent appeared at King's office at approximately 1:50 p.m. where.he

waited for an hour before being admitted to King's office. King stated

he was sorry to keep the Agent waiting but he was behind in his paper

work and had completed some of it before admitting the Agent.

King in connection with

In June, 1962, efforts were made to obtain an appointment with

a case involving shirley Blackwell Cummings, a

Peace Corps applicant. Beginning on approximately 6/5/62, King's

secretary kept stating that he was not available for interview although

it was known to us that he was in his office daily. On 6/8/62 Wyatt T

Walker, King's assistant, advised the Atlanta Office that he and King

were proceeding to Shreveport, Louisiana, in connection with the voter

registration drive and that the Kittle Union Baptist Church in

Shreveport had received a bomb threat. At that time, Walker was informec

chat Agents had been urgently trying to make an appointment with King

and Walker stated an appointment would be made. On 6/8/62 King telephoned

the Atlanta Office from Shreveport to inquire as to why the Agent wanted

an appointment and to advise of the bomb threat previously furnished by

Walker. King consented to interview which was conducted 6/9/62.

King was also interviewed by the Atlanta Office on 7/24/62

connection with racial incidents at Albany, Georgia, involving

alleged violation by King of a temporary restraining order issued by

the U. S. District Court to stop demonstrations. The interview was

conducted

in the U. S. courtroom where king had appeared for a hearing.

On 6/25/63 the Atlanta Office attempted to contact King to

advise him of a threat against his life. Efforts to contact him were

at first unsuccessful, but after a delay of some hours, King's secretary

informed him of the Bureau's interest in talking to him and arrangements

were made for an Agent to contact King by telephone.

Martin Luther King made to newsmen immediately after leaving the Director's Office

this afternoon. While this is not a verbatim account of the statement, it is as near

accurate as possible:

I am pleased I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Hoover

, this afternoon and I might say the discussion was quite amicable. I

sought to make it clear to Mr. Hoover that the plight of Negroes in

the South is such that there must not be any misunderstanding between

the FBI and civil rights leaders but must be a determination to defend

the rights of all.

We talked specifically about those areas where SCE.C will be

working in the months ahead. We discussed areas where there will

be strong resistance to the implementation of the civil rights bill.

We made it clear that we found our most difficult problems in Alabama

and Mississippi and in these communities there are areas where we

see a great deal of potential and sometimes actual terror.

• I sincerely hope we can forget the confusion of the past and get

on with the job the Congress, the Supreme Court and the President

have outlined as America's most crucial problem; namely, the job of

giving and providing security and justice to all the people in the world.

NBC's Russ Ward and one of the NBC men equipped with a tape recorder

followed King down the hall and on through the courtyard where his car was parked.

According to the NBC technician, King was talking with them all the time. He said that

King expressed "the usual pratter" and the only statement of any consequence was

something to the effect that arrests in the Mississippi murder case could be expected

within the next few days.

APPOINTMENT WITH DIRECTOR

3:35 P.M., 12-1-64

/At Reverend King's request, the Director met with King; Reverend Ralph

Abernathy, Secretary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC);

Dr. Andrew Houng, Executive Assistant to King; and Walter Hauntroy,' SCLC

representative here in Washington, at 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64, in the Director's Office.

• I met King and his associates in the hallway outside the Director's Office.

An attempt was made to rush them directly through the reception room, however, King

slowly posed for the cameras and newsmen before proceeding.

1: 1

Upon being introduced to the Director," Reverend King indicated his

appreciation for Mr. Hoover's seeing him then stated that Reverend Abernathy would

speak first. Reverend Abernathy told the Director it was a great privilege to meet the

distinguished Director of the FBI-a man who had done so much for his country.

• Reverend Abernathy expressed the appreciation of the Negro race for the Director's

fine work in the field of civil rights. He stated that the Negroes had problems,

particularly in the South, and, therefore, had requested a discussion with the Director

at the very time their people were continuing to "rise up from their bondage."

Reverend King spoke up. He stated it was vitally necessary to keep a

working relationship with the FBI. He wanted to clear up any misunderstanding which

might have occurred. He stated that some Negroes had told him that the FBI had been

ineffective, however, he was inclined to discount such criticism. Reverend King asked

that the Director please understand that any criticism of the Director and the FBI which

had been attributed to King was either a misquote of an outright misrepresentation. He

stated this particularly concerned Albany, Georgia. He stated that the only time he had

ever criticized the FBI was because of instances in which Special Agents who had been

given complaints in civil rights cases regarding brutality by police officers were seen

the following day being friendly with those same police officers. King stated this, of

course, promoted distrust inasmuch as the police sometires "brutalized" Negroes.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

Reverend King stated he personally appreciated the great work of the FBI

which had been done in so many instances. He stated this was particularly true in

Mississippi. He added that FBI developments in that State have been very significant.

The FBIis a great restraining influence. Reverend King denied that he had ever stated

that Negroes should not report information to the FBI. He said he had actually encouraged

such reporting in many instances. He claimed there were good relationships in many

communities, especially Atlanta, Georgia, between Negroes and the FBI, He stated he

would continue to strongly urge all of his people to work closely with the FBI.

Reverend King stated he has never made any personal attack upon

Mr. Hoover. He stated he had merely tried to articulate the feelings of the Negroes in

the South in order to keep a tradition of nonviolence rather than violence. He added that

the Negro should never be transferred from a policy of nonviolence to one of violence and

terrot.e

Reverend King said that the Director's report to the President this summer

on rioting was a very excellent analysis.

186"

Reverend King advised that Negroes are currently laboring under a very

frustrating situation.

He stated that, "We sometimes are on the verge of temporary

despair." He added that it was a challenge and a duty for him to keep the Negro from

coming to a boiling point. He stated that sometimes the cries coming from the Negro

represent a real feeling of lonesomeness and despair. He, however, has pointed out that

the path to success is nonviolence rather than violence.

Reverend King stated he has been, and still is, very concerned regarding

the matter of communism in the civil rights movement. He stated he knew that the

Director was very concerned because he bore the responsibility of security in the Nation.

Reverend King stated that from a strong philosophical point of view he could never become

a communist inasmuch as he recognizes this to be a crippling totalitarian disease. He

stated that as a Christian he could never accept communism. He claimed that when he

learns of the identity of a communist in his midst he immediately deals with the problem

by removing this man. He stated there have been one or two communists who were

engaged in fund raising for the SCHC. Reverend King then corrected himself to say that

these one or two men were former communists and not Party members at the present time.

He then identified "Jack/O'Dell" as an example. He stated that he had insisted that O'Dell

leave his staff because the success of his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, was far more important than friendship with O'Dell.

The Director interrupted King to state that the FBI had learned from long

experience that the communists move in when trouble starts. The Director explained that

communists thrive on chaos. The Director mentioned that his riot report to the President

reflected the opportunistic efforts of communists. He then stated that communists have

no interest in the future of the Negro race and that King, of all people, should be aware of

this fact. The Director spoke briefly of communist attempts to infiltrate the labor

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.mo, 12-1-64

The Director told King and his associates that the FBI shares the same

despair which the Negroes suffer when Negro leaders refused to accept the deep

responsibility they have in the civil rights movement. He stated that when Negroes are..

encouraged not to cooperate with the FBI this sometimes frustrates or delays successful

solution.of investigations. The Director told King that he had personally gone to

Mississippi to meet with Governor Paul Johnson inasmuch as there had been practically

no liaison between the Department of Justice, the President and the State of Mississippi

beforehand. The Director stated that upon meeting Governor Johnson the Governor

explained honestly that he was a segregationist, however, abhorred violence. The

Director stated that he had told Governor Johnson they had a common meeting ground

inasmuch as he was in Mississippi to put an end to violence and brutality. The Director

told Governor Johnson that he would like to do this in collaboration with the State Police,

however, if the FBI could not receive such cooperation we would do it on our own. The

Director then made reference to watermoccasins, rattlesnakes and redneck sheriffs, in

that order, who still exist in Mississippi who represent the trashy type of characters who

are promoting civil rights violations. The Director told King that we had trained twenty

representatives of the Mississippi State Highway Patrol and that this had represented a

good move to promote better cooperation and solution of civil rights cases.

The Director told Reverend King that the FBI had put the "fear of God" in

the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He told King that we knew of the identity of the murderers of

the three civil rights workers and that these murderers would soon be brought to trial.

•The Director then spoke of the terror in Mississippi backwoods and of the fact that

Sheriffs, and deputy sheriffs participate in crimes of violence. He summarized by telling

King that we, therefore, are under the same strain that sincere Negro leaders are under.

The Director added that the KKK constantly damns the FBI and that we have currently

been classified as the "Federal Bureau of Integration" in Mississippi.

The Director told King that many cases, which have been brought about as

a result of FBI investigation, must be tried in State Court. He spoke of the difficulty in

obtaining a verdict of guilty in instances in which white juries are impaneled in cases

involving white men. The Director spoke of the KRK involvement in the Lemuel Penn cas:

just outside of Athens, Georgia. He stated this was an outrageous miscarriage of justice

in that the defendants, despite the open and shut evidence on the part of the FBI, had been

acquitted.

The Director made it clear to Reverend King and his associates that the

FBI could not state whether a conviction would be obtained or not in the case involving the :

murdered three civil rights victims. He stated, however, that the FBI has excellent

evidence in this case. The Director then explained that it was most necessary for the

FBI not to "jump the gun" unless we had sufficient evidence in which a case could be

brought to trial.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. Mo, 12-1-64

The Director made reference to Reverend King's allegation that the FBI

deals or associates with law enforcement officers who have been involved in civil rights

violations. He stated emphatically that, "I'll be damned if the FBI has associated with

any of these people nor will we be associated with them in the future.". The Director

explained that the FBI, not only because of the very nature of the law but also because of

the background of our investigative employees, was in full"sympathy with the sincere

aspects of the civil rights movement. He stated that the FBI constantly needs cooperatir •

and assistance in order to solve cases. He added that he made it a point, several years

part, northern-born Agents are assigned civil rights cases in the South. The Director

added that he feels that our special Agents, regardless of where they are born, wil

investigate a case impartially and thoroughly. He mentioned, however, that it was unfair

to the Agent and the FBI to "have a strike against him" in that criticism had been leveled

over the fact that southern Agents would not give Negroes a "fair shake." The Director

stated that such criticism was entirely unjustifiable and that no case had ever been brought

to our attention proving such a fact.

The Director made reference to the recent case in McComb, Missis sippi,

in which nine men had been charged with burning churches and violence against Negroes.

He stated this again was a miscarriage.of justice. He added that the judge's decision in

releasing the defendants because they had learned their lesson and were merely youths

was entirely wrong and that it caused some people to question where youth really began.

He explained that some of the defendants had been in their 40*s. The Director added that

a deal probably, of course, had been made, however, this would certainly not represent

any deterrent to future actions of violence by these men.

The Director explained that there is a great misunderstanding today among

the general public and particularly the Negro race as to what the FBI can and cannot do

in the way of investigations. The Director emphasized that the FBI cannot recommend

prosecution or declination of prosecution. He stated that Agents cannot make "on the spot"

arrests. He stated that the FBI merely investigates and then the Departmont of Justice

determines whether prosecution be entertained or not. The Director added that the

question is sometimes raised why prosecution is not scheduled sooner. He stated this,

of course, was not the responsibility of the FBI in any way whatsoever. He pointed out

that our civil rights investigations are conducted in a very thorough and expeditious

manner once the Department has authorized such investigations.

The Director spoke of the FBI's successful penetration of the KKK. He

stated that the FBI has interviewed all members of the KKK in Mississippi and has

served notice to these members that if trouble occurs we plan to come to them first.

He

stated our penetration of the KKK has been as successful as the manner in which we

infiltrated the communists and the Soviet espionage services. He stated that our progres

in infiltrating the KKK has been so rapid that Klan members now suspect each other and

are fighting among themselves. The Director mentioned that we have two confessions in

the killing of the three civil rights workers. He added that the Klan in Mississippi has

failed to meet for some time because the members of this organization are apprehensive

as to the identity of FBI informants

, in their midst. The Director stated he had personally

been an enemy of the KKK for a long time.

He spoke of the FBI's case in Louisiana in the late 1920's in which FBI

evidence successfully culminated in the conviction of the top Klan leader. He stated the

KKK fully concentrated on Negroes, Jews and Catholics, however, concentration now

is strictly on the Negro race.

The Director told the group that in the Lemuel Penn case the defendants

have recently been indicted and are to stand trial in Federal Court. He stated the trial

would begin sometime next week. He mentioned that the same defendants were

responsible for beating Negroes and participation in other acts of violence. The Director

added that the FBI's success in infiltrating the KKK has been so extensive that we now

sometimes know in advance what the KKK plans to do and take preventive measures

accordingly.

The Director explained that in Alabama the FBI cannot deal with the

Highway Patrol because of the psychoneurotic tendencies of the Alabama Governor.

He

stated that the State of Georgia has a good Governor and that the Georgia Bureau of

Investigation, while not comparable to the Mississippi Highway Patrol, has cooperated

with the FBI.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that FBI

representatives have held several thousand law enforcement conferences in which

southern police officers have been educated as to civil rights legislation. He stated this

has clearly assisted law enforcement, particularly the FBI, however, admittedly, this

represents slow progress, but progress nevertheless. He added that this educational

campaign will be continued and that it will eventually take hold. The Director gave the

example of a Mississippi Sheriff who recently broke a case as a result of FBI training.

The Director made it very clear to Reverend King and his associates that

FBI Agents conduct very thorough interviews in civil rights cases. He stated he would

like to know immediately if any of our Special Agents ever act in a supercilieus manner

or if they mishandle a complaint regarding civil rights. He stated that if the facts

reflect that our Agent is in the wrong he will be called on the carpet fast. The. Director

asked that Reverend King or any of his representatives feel free to call the FBI at any

time they have such complaints.

The Director told Reverend King he desired to give him some advice. He

stated that one of the greatest things the Negro leaders could accomplish woula be to

encourage voting. registration among their people. Another thing would be to educate their

people in the skills so that they could compete in the open market. The Director

mentioned several professions in which Negroes could easily learn skills. The Director

also told King he wanted him to know that registrars in the South were now more careful

in their actions. He stated that there were less attempts now to prevent Negroes from

DeLoach to Mohr 12-2-64

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

registering inasmuch as the FBI is, watching such actions very carefully. The Director

told Reverend King that the FBI was making progress in violations regarding

discrimination in eating places. He gave as a specific example a restaurant in Atlanta,

Georgia, in which surveillances have taken place to ascertain if out-of-state cars are

being served at this particular resaurant. The Director stated he personally was in

favor of equality in eating places and in schools. He stated emphatically, however, he

was not in favor of taking Negro children 10 or 12 miles across town simply because

their parents wanted them to go to a school other than those in their specific

neighborhood.

The Director told Reverend King that in due time there will be a complete

change in the mores of community thinking in the United States regarding the racial

problem. He stated that meanwhile the FBI will continue to handle its responsibilities

in a thorough and impartial manner. He reiterated that the FBI cannot encourage

prosecution in Federal Court despite the fact that some local courtscannot be trusted. He

added that some judges cannot be trusted.

The Director praised the Georgia papers that declared the verdict of the

Penn case to be a travesty of justice. He added thät the Jackson, Mississippi, papers

had contained several editorials deploring violence against Negroes and participation in

church burnings. The same editorials declared this was no way to solve racial

problems. The Director stated that his statements made at a press conference in

Jackson, Mississippi, this summer to the effect that he was in Mississippi to see to it

that an end was put to the violence of bombings and burning churches had had some affect

upon backwoods terrorists.

The Director told King that he wanted to make it very clear that the

question is often raised as to whether the FBI will protect civil rights workers or Negroes

He stated that he has in the past and will continue to answer such questions on the basis

that the FBI does not have the authority nor the jurisdiction to protect anyone. He stated

that when the Department of Justice desires that Negroes be protected this is the

responsibility of U. S. Marshals. The Director reiterated that the FBI is strictly an

investigative agency and cannot and will not extend itself beyond legislated jurisdiction.

The Director repeated very emphatically that while our investigations are very definitely

thorough and impartial he wanted to state once again that it Reverend King or any of his

associates ever knew of a Special Agent showing bias or prejudice he wanted to know

about this matter immediately.

The Director explained that we have civil rights cases not only in the

South but also in the northern cities. He gave examples of New York and Chicago. He

stated that there-have been some cases in Miami, Florida.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment with Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

The Director spoke once again of the necessity of the Negro educating

himself in order to compete in manual and professional skills. He mentioned the

example of a shoeshine boy in Miami, Florida, who turned out to be, after questioning

by the Director, a graduate of Howard University. This shoeshine boy, a Negro,

explained to the Director that he could not get a job above the level of shoeshine boy

because of the color of his skin, The Director stated this, of course, was wrong and

that under no circumstances did he, or anyone in the FBI, share the opinion that the

Negro, or any other race, should be kept down. -The Director spoke of his pride in

Negro Agents and particularly mentioned Special Agent Aubrey Lewis, the former

Notre Dame track star who is currently assigned to the New York Division,

The Director spoke of a Miami Speciad Agent who was transferred to that

Oftice from St. Louis. This Agent explained to the Director on one occasion that he was

first a little upset about being transferred to Miami because he felt that his race would

be against him. He stated, however, much to his surprise, that the white people in

Miami treated him with the greatest of courtesy while people of his own race referred to

him as a "fink" simply because he was a representative of law enforcement.

Reverend King interrupted the Director at this point and asked if this same

Negro Agent is still assigned to the Miami Division. The Director replied in the

affirmative. The Director stated that at a recent dinner Father Hesburgh, the President

of Notre Dame University, explained to the Director that his institution had difficulty

getting Negroes on the football team because their grades were never high enough. The

Director told Reverend King the same thing is true of Negroes who apply for the position

of Special Agent. He stated in most instances they lack the qualifications, however, we

were very happy to hire any Negro who was qualified for the position. The Director told

Reverend King that we, of course, could not let down our qualifications simply because

of the color of a person's skin.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that the problems that

he and the Negro leaders have is a mutual problem. He stated in most instances in civil

rights matters we have learned that "you are damned if you do and you are damned it you

don't. " The Director stated nevertheless the FBI would continue to do its job. He stated

that we additionally are very proud of 10 or 11 Indian Special Agents and of a number of

Special Agents who have Mexican blood in them. He stated that the color of a man's skin

makes no difference to the FBI whatsoever, however, we do merit the cooperation and.

assistance of all groups and it is most unfair when these groups are taught not to

cooperate with the FBI.

The Director mentioned that he wanted to make it very plain that the FBI

will not tolerate any of our personnel being slapped around. He gave an example of the

Lombardozzi case in New York where one of our Agents was jumped by five hodlums

outside a church. He stated these hoodlums were immediately taught a lesson. The

Director mentioned that in the war with hoodlums, for every man we lose we make

we stain, too le me a course, that the hoodlums lose the same number or more

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

The Director proudly spoke of the ability of agents to outshoot and

outfight hoodlums and other individuals who attempted to take advantage of our personnel.

He stated the KKK is afraid to "mix" with our Agents. He mentioned that the Klan was

"yellow." He stated they are brave as long as they have the majority with them but

afraid when they face an equal number.

The Director spoke of the Mack Charles Parker Case in Poplarville,

Mississippi. He stated that our evidence in this case had been turned over to Governor

Coleman, the then Governor of that State. He mentioned that Governor Coleman was a

decent type of individual who had immediately seen to it that a State Court received the

evidence contributed by the FBI. The Director mentioned that our evidence in this case

was excellent, however, the Grand Jury refused to indict the subjects involved in the

lynching of Parker.

The Director told Reverend King that in many instances our Agents have

been spit upon, they have been refused food and lodging and many things are done to

thwart hard-hitting investigations by the FBI. He stated that nevertheless we continue

to gather evidence in an expeditious and thorough manner.

Reverend Abernathy stated that the Negroes have a real problem in

tearing down the current system of segregated voting tests in the South. He stated it was

most important that there be kept alive in the Negro communities a ray of hope. He

stated that the Negro people should not be allowed to fall into an atmosphere of despair.

The Director explained that this was a very important point. He stated

that real progress has been made in higher wages, voting registration and housing

matters. The Director pointed out, however, that such progress has not been

emphasized by the rabblerousers who constantly attempt to stir up the Negroes against

the whites. The Director gave as an example the communist, Epton in New York City.

The Director stated that Epton is sometimes pointed to as a person the Negro should

emulate because of his militancy. The Director stated this was wrong and it is also

wrong to "mislead" Negroes.

Reverend Abernathy stated that the SCLC does not want Negroes like

Epton in their movement. He stated that Reverend King, more than anyone else, has

prevented people like Epton and the Muslims from taking over the civil righs movement.

Reverend Abernathy stated that actually the Negroes are a part of the Federal

Government, therefore, anything that represents the Federal Government is an

encouragement to the Negro. He added that even the side of a post office building or a

Federal courtroom is an encouragement to the Negro. He mentioned that when a Negro

receives information that a case in which he has been brutally mistreated is gring to

Federal Court he feels encouraged over the fact that he will get a fair trial. Reverend

Koernathy continued that the same problem is true when a Negro sees an FBI Agent.

He

stated that the Negro feels open encouragement inasmuch as the FBI will not only fairly

handlè his case but will serve as a great deterrent to violence.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

The Director stated that the KKK today is represented by common white

trash. He stated that the Klan was actually worse than the Communist Party inasmuch

as the Klan resorts to violence while the communists usually emulate termites in their

activities.

The Director reiterated that King and his associates should feel free to

call him at any time when they have knowledge

rights field. He stated he has been very surprised to see some communities comply

with the new civi rights statutes. He stated there still are some pockets of resistence

particularly in the South. He added that the SCLC is planning to stimulate voting

registration activities in Selma, Alabama, in the near future. He mentioned that some

members of his organization have been successful in infiltrating this white community

and have learned there is a great potential for violence, in Selma.

The Director interrupted King and briefly detailed five cases in which the

FBI has gathered evidence in Selma, Alabama. The Director identified these cases

fully, and specifically the case against Sheriff James Clark. The Director mentioned

that these cases came about as a result of FBI investigation and that we were continuing

our investigations in Selma, Alabama. He mentioned that one case would come to trial

on December 9, 1964. The Director particularly made reference to the fact that we have

three excellent cases in Selma at the present time.

Reverend King inquired as to whether his representatives should notify

the FBI when they arrive in Selma, Alabama. He quickly corrected himself that he knew

his representatives should contact the FBI upon arrival, however, he asked the Direcior

what would be the possibilities of FBI Agents being in Selma, Alabama, inasmuch as

there appeared to be a potential for violence. The Director specifically asked Reverend

King when his activities would take place. Reverend Abernathy indicated such activity

would take place around January 1, 1965. The Director clearly explained that FBI

Agents would be in Selma, not for the purpose of "protecting" anyone, but for the

purpose of observing and reporting to the Department of Justice any possible violations

of civil rights that might occur.. Reverend King expressed appreciation in this regard.

Reverend King stood up and stated he wished'to express his personal

thanks for a most fruitful and necessary meeting. The Director told Reverend King that

he should get in touch with us at anytime he felt it was necessary.

Reverend King mentioned that there were representatives of the press in

the Director's reception room. He turned to me and asked if the FBI planned to make

any comment regarding the meeting. I told him that the Director had instructed that we

make no comment whatsoever. Reverend King asked the Director if there would be any

objections if he read a short prepared statement to the press. The Director told

Reverend King this, of course, was up to him.

In proceeding to the reception room, Reverend King pulled out a press

release, hand-written in ink, out of his right coat pocket. This press release obviously

had been prepared prior to the time Reverend King arrived at FBI Headquarters.

ACTION:

It is suggested that the attached letter be sent to the President concerning

the meeting between the Director, Reverend King and his associates.

The General Investigative Division, Civil Rights Section, should take

due note of the proposed activities in Selma, Alabama, and should instruct the

appropriate office to make certain that Agents are on hand to observe activities in Selma,

Alabama, on or around January 1, 1965.

determined that these charges were without basis.

Reverend King categorically denied ever having made

a persons, attack on me and aiso achica that te had ever instructe !

Negroes not to cooperate with the IDl. I told him that when Negroes

from egressing their frustrations through violence. Reverend ling

made roference to ruy report to you on the rioting thai took place in

some of our northern cities last'summer. He indicated he considers

it an excellent analysis of the situation.

Communist intiltration of the civil rights movement

was discussed. Reverend King stated that as a Christian he could

never accept communism and that he shared my concern with the

problem.

He described communism as a "crippling, totalitarian

disease. " He said that while there are "one or two" former com-

munists currently engaged in jund-raising activities for the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, he does not tolerate communists in

his organization. lie cited the communist background of Hunter Pitts

O'Dell and noted that he considered the success of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conterence more important to him than his friendship with

O'Dell. Consequently, he claimed, O'Dell ís no longer associated

with his organization.

The President®

The problems confronting the FBi in civil righte

investigations were explained to the leverend King in detail. I

mate it clear to him that cases doveloped as a result o1 Fei

investigation must often be tried in local courts where there are

citiculties involved in geitizy milite juries to convict white

defendants in connection with civil rights matters. I cited some of

our experiences in this regard.

He and his associates were advised of the recent

conferences held for local law enforcement officers throughout the

United states for the purpose of fully acquainting them with civil rights

legislation and their responsibilities in connection with same. I told

him that the results of this campaign have been encouraging in the

cooperation received.

I pointed out to him that there is a great misunderstanding

today among the general public and particularly the Negro race as to

the v?I's role in civil rights matters. I emphasized that the F'Slis an

investigative ageney, that it cannot recommend prosecution or make

on-the-spot arrests where federal laws have not been violated. He

was adviced that the T'BI will not protect civil rights workers or

Negroes because the FBl does not have the authority or jurisdiction

• to do so. He was also advised that the FBI cannot and will not

exceed its authority. Reverend King was told that our investigations

are conducted in a thorough and impartial manner, but li he or any of

his associates knew of a Special Agent who had shown bias or prejucice,

. I wanted to know about it immediately.

Reverend King indicated that the Fouthern Christian

Leadership Conference is planning to engage in voter registration

activities in Selma, Alabama, on or about January 1, 1065, and that

he has learned that there could be violence. I told him that our Agents

would be on the scene, not for the purpose of rendering protection,

but to observe and report to the Department of Justice any possible

violations of civil rights that may occur.

Menorandum from W. C. Sullivan to A. H. Belmont 12/24/63

Summarized the results of a conference held at the Seat of Government

12/23/63 between Bureau officials and Supervisors and field repre-

sentatives designed to explore how best to carry on our investigation

of captioned matter to produce the desired results without embarrass

ment to the Bureau.

We completely analyzed avenues of approach aimed

at neutralizing Martin Luther King, Jr., as an effective Negro leader

One of the avenues explored was that concerning any facets of the

financial operations of King and the organizations through which he

operates which investigation might reveal either violations of the

lay or other potentials for discrediting King or otherwise neutralizing

his effectiveness.

Bufiles contain two items of particular significance.

A

Washington Capital News Service release dated 10/22/63 reveals

that

King's integration organization had an income of more than $735,000

during the past fiscal year and spent only about half of it. It is

stated that in a report of the financial status of the Southern Chris-i

tian Leadership Conference (SCLC), of which king is President, King

I disclosed that the orginization had a balance of $351, 992.20 left

8/31:63 at the end of the fiscal year from a total income of $735,534,0%0

Another such news release dated 11/4/63 revealed that Representative

George Andrews (D-Ala.) asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to

investigate the tax status of the SCLO.

Andrews is quoted as saying,

"Thousands and thousands of dollars are collected aid spent each year

by so-called civil rights organizations and many people are beginning.

to suspect they could be a front for a full-grown racket."

It is noted that King's operations revolve principally arounds

the SCLC.

However, lund-raising operations on his part are further augô

mented by the activities of the Gandhi Society: for Human Rights, Which

commenced operations in 1962. '

OBSERVATIONS:

It is believed that an examination of recent income tax

returns of King might well reveal information which could assist the

Buxeau in its eriorts to discredit King or neutralize his erfective-

This is possibly applicable also if the incone tax returns of -

the scLC and the Gandhi Society were reviewed.

In view of the possi

bility that the SCLC has already been under some investigation by IRS,

a request for the results of such investigation is indicated.

had information in late 1963 that the Gandhi Society was negotiating

with IRs relative to tax exemptions and therefore the results of any

IRs investigation of that Society would be worth procuring.

To date we have been most discreet and circumspect in our

handling of the king investigation, as well as corollary investiga-

tions such as revolving around organizations, because of the position

King has not only as a clergyman, but also as a "respected" Negro

leader.

It is therefore essential that our current requests of the

IRS which are herein being recommended be handled in a manner which

would provide for optimum security so that neither King

nor any other

unauthorized individuals may become aware of the Bureau's interest

and so that no embarrassment may come to the Bureau. For this reason,

attached memoranda are classified "Secret."

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that the Liaison Section obtain two

uncertified copies of each of the income tax returns arailable for

the past five years pertaining to King, the SCLC and the Gandhi

Society.

Attached hereto are three menoranda for the use of the

Liaison

Section.

District of IRS failed to reveal an income tax return.

It is noted,

hovever, that on 3/20/63, the organization made an application for

exempt

organization status.

The application was denied.

Reason for

denial is not known but believed to be that it was because the organiza-

tion had then not been in existence for 12 months.

On 10/15/63 the

organization reapplied for exempt status which application is currently

pending in the Audit Division of the Manhattan Districi.

summarized, for appropriate action, information obtained concerning

to inform relative to the following information concerning king

obtained by Liaison Agent P. D. Putnam through A. R. Manzi of IRS.

Joint returns of King and his spouse were subject of

investigative scrutiny by IRS during 1960-1961 and it was found that

King was deficient for the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 for a total

O1 $1,556.02 which represented deficient taxes plus penalties. IRS

considered the application "öf a fraud penalty but found such to be

inappropriate as it was not able to establish the fraudulent intent

of the taxpayer.

The IRs inquiry developed that in July, 1960;

the

State of Alabama indicted and tried King for perjury on his state

l income tax return but failed to convict him.

"It was revealed in the IRS file that after a particular

Form was

by King who protested that his accountant had misrepresented

King dismissed Blayton and called in Stanley D. Levison,

New

York attorney, to represent him.

There resulted a meeting in

April, 1961, between an IRS investigator, King, Levison and another.

attorney representing king, Chauncey Eskridge of Chicago.

The,

IRs investigator noted that after this meeting he was informed

the

first time that there was a $10,000 cash gift

„from a "Loeyi

family" in New York..

This sounded to the investigator "like a

complete

fabrication."

Further questioning of King developed that

this gift consisted of two $5,000 gifts, one in 1957 and one in 1958.

He pointed out that ins had very carefully scrutinized bays

King's returns in the past but had not been able to establish

a cause of action against him. While IRS has no action pending

at this time, King's current income tax return will be scrutinized

very carefully to determine whether any violations appear.

this. time, however, IRS is taking no additional action on his

prior returns.

The Attorney General

Invescigator noted that aiter this irst joint westing he

was then informed for the first time thai ling had zeceived a

$10,000 cash gift fron a "Loews fanily" in New York.

investicator commented in his report that "This sounded like

a complete Labrication."

further questioning of King developed

that this gift consisted of two $5,000 gifts, one in 1937 and

one in 1958.

Schedules appended to the IRS report contain data

a $5,000 cift from the "roevi family and Stanley Levison"

In 1957 and a $5,000 gift izon the "Loewi family" in 1958.

"The "hoevi family" is not further identified in these IRS

Is being nade in the investization of captioned natter

as well as suggestions toward exploring new avenues of

Investigation.

On page nine it was noted that Martin Luther

King, Jr., has a personal bank account in New York City but

that

the name of the bank is unknowi.

Reurlet April 23, 1964; copy to Atlanta, which

reported that an account in the name of the Southern Christian

Leadershiy Conference (SCLC), which King heads, had been

maintained at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust

Company,

New Yorl City, but such account had been closed on January 16,

2964.

Noting that certain strong factors set oud in

re Atlanta letter nitigato against any possible audit of

King's personal account in an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, the

Bureau believes that mora than ever it would bo most

desirable

to identity any bank where he may have an account in New York

City and, thereafter, consider a: audit of such account.

New York is, therefore, instructed to give tull consideration

to & canvass of banks in New York. City in an effort to locate

any account in King's name.

Such inquiry aust, et course,

Do extremely discreet and conducted through only established

rellable sources.

Such canvass may be undertaisen inmediately

unless you have reasons for not doing so, in which ovent the
