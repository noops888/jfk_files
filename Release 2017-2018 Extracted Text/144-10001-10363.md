UGANDA OFFICIAL GIVES HIS VERSION OF COUP D'ÉTAT IN ZANZIBAR

17 Jan 64

• Immediate

44USC2107(5)(g)(2)(D)|

The following statement of Zanzibar coup d'état has just

been issued by the Uganda Minister of Information, Broadcasting

and Tourism:

"Who deposed the Sultan of Zanzibar? Many people in East

Africa have reacted to the revolution' in Zanzibar where the

government has been overthrown and. the Sultan deposed. They

have now formed their own opinion's as to whether the coup d'état

was good or bad.

But unfortunately not much attention has been

paid to the methods or the means used to bring about the

revolution. But for the sake of record and history, it is

good to try to establish who was responsible for the overthrow-

ing of the government

would benefit by suer. and setting up a new one; future generations

an exercise, as with the assassination of

President KENNEDY Of America, the

name of Cubans and Communists

has been drawn in by the western press reporters. Is it true

that the Cubans organized the coup or not? What would motivate

Cuba to do so? Has Cuba any interest in the islands, if so, what

are they? When I went for the Zanzibar Independence Celebzatton,

I met Cuban representatives in Zanzibar. They had been invited by

the government which has been overthrown now, which meant that

the government was friendly to them. But it was there on

10 December 1963, at the Palace of the Sultan in front of which

Lay the ship SALlikAllf, which has carcled the sultan away,

that a top ranking British officer who was to leave Zanzibar

the following day after many years of service there, told me

that he was sorry; only for one thing, namely, that independence

of Zanzibar had come before the formation of the East African

Federation, because he thought Zanzibar might become a Cuba to

the East African mainland. Now how could Cuba overthrow another

Cuba? Cuba being so far away from Zanzibar, how would the Cubans

get into Zanzibar and by which ship? The truth is that the former

government was a socialist government which was friendly to

Cairo, Indonesia and Cuba. The following points are of prime

importance:

The British commissioner of police, Me. SULLIVAN,

was not attacked in spite of the fact that he was in charge of

the only armed force in the country. The Sultanes Palace was

not attacked immediately-unlike in the Russian Revolution. Only

Indians were in fact reported to have been captured and imprisoned

although the British also owned property on the island. The

British and Americans were reported quite safe in the European

club. The American Project Mercury, worth 14 gr G] million,

was never attacked although it is ironical that the Sultan

should now feel that he would be

safe in Dar-es-Salaam where

Mr. BABU, who is now the Foreign.'Minister, and most probably

Mr. KARUME were., at the beginning of the revolution and from

where, unlike other people they could leave for Zanzibar during

the revolution, without any apparent difficulty. The former

government asked for assistance, but the new government asked

Tanganyika for medical assistance. Mr. KISASA was immediately

appointed by the revolutionary council, to take over the key and

most strategic position of Commissioner of Police, a sign of

great confidence."
