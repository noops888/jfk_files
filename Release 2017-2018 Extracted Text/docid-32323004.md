VETERANS MATTERS

IS - C

On January 6, 1960, SA W. HARLAN BROWN received in

person a typewritten report from DI-?-S, dated 1/4/60, which

has been serialised as 134-4A-305.

Informant advised ke had learned that on 12/22/59,

JOE LANDIN and AUGUSTIN ESTRADA held a meeting at the place where

ESTRADA works.

They discussed the G.J. Forun activity.

LANDIN

told ESTRADA that the Forum's members were not willing to work

towards increasing the sale of poll tax by the Latin-American

population.

It was determined that LANDIN, BOB JONES and JIM

COLMAN were members of the Forum's poll tax connittee.

So far,

COLMAN has already contacted Senator HENRY B. GONZALEZ and

arranged for him to be in Dallas on Suaday, 1/10/60.

The Senator

is to speak before a predominately Latin-American public on the

importance of buying the poll tax. The Forum, however, is not

willing to pay for the Senatorts expenses which COLEMAN said would

be $100.00.

Informant advised that COLEMAN asked Forum Chairman

BILL LOWERY to call a Forum special meeting to discuss thia

matter. BILL LOwERY would not do it because of the nearness of

29th of December, LOWERY seemed to be sure the Forun will reject

doth ot December LongÂ®

LOWERY told COLEMAN he would have to wait until the

COLEMAN's idea and that the Senator's trip will have to be

canceled.

During the discussion of the G.I. Forum activity,

it was stated that COLEVAN is so fed up and disappointed with the
