RET

The subject of above SSC inguiry, Joseph Kraft,

is a well-known newspaper columnist.

A review of the

Kraft file reveals that the French Security Service, the

DST, conducted a microphone surveillance on Kraft's hotel

room for approximately one week during a 1969 visit by

Kraft to Paris. Such coverage was effected through the

urging of w. C. Sullivan, former FBI Assistant to the

Director, who traveled to France at that time, apparently

at the direction of deceased FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.

Details of the above coverage have appeared in the media

apparently as a result of leaks within the administration

of former President Nixon.

Kraft himself testified in de-

tail 5/10/74, regarding this matter before the United States

Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure,

the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee

on the Judiciary, and the Subcommittee on Surveillance of

SUBCOMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT INFORMATION

AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON

GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

At 4:05 p.m. on November 25, Miss Helen Gandy,

formerly

the Administrative Assistant to Director Hoover, telephonically advised

me that she was at that time in her doctor's office consulting him con-

cerning her high blood pressure. She said that her doctor advised her

that it would not be in her interest to appear in public testimony as

requested by captioned committee. Miss Gandy called to ask me to

whom a letter from her doctor to that effect should be addressed. I

told Miss Gandy that the letter describing the doctor's advice to her

would be properly addressed to the Chairman of the subcommittee. She

said that would be Mrs. Abzug and I told her that would be correct.

Miss Gandy said that she also understood that a witness called

for testimony who desires to make a prepared statement is required to

furnish the committee 50 copies prior to the appearance. She expressed

concern that she would be unable to comply with that requirement. I told

Miss Gandy that under those circumstances it would be appropriate for

her to advise the committee that she did not have the facilities to provide

them 50 copies of any statement she might make.

Miss Gandy said that she would consider further whether she

would appear.

ADDENDUM, LEGAL COUNSEL, JAM:mtm, 11/25/75:

Miss Gandy called again at 5:13 p.m. on November 25, to

advise me that her doctor had prepared a letter addressed "To Whom

It May Concern" in which he described her history of high blood pressure

and in which he recommends against her appearance for public testimony.

Miss Gandy said that she called Mr. Jacobs, the staff representative who

interviewed her and read to him the doctor's letter.

She said she would

leave it entirely up to Mr. Jacobs and the committee if she should appear

under those circumstances. She said that Mr. Jacobs requested the name

and address of her doctor and asked whether Miss Gandy would object to

the doctor being contacted. Miss Gandy furnished the name and address

and said she would not object.

DARE NE 21/00 BY SPALM/e

lir, Cartha D. Beloach, former Assistant to the

Director, was deposed by and furnished information to the

SSC on November 25 and 26, 1975. He was represented by

personal counsel during these interviews.

He has advised

this Bureau that his busy personal schedule precludes his

furnishing us the details of the interviews, either in

vritten or oral forn. In this regará, he indicated that le

has found annoying the considerable demands placed on his

time by the SSC resulting from the interviews as well as

his appearance at public hearings of the SSC. Deloach did,

however, voluntarily furnish this Bureau the following

of interest to you.

RIC-51 63-11÷20

Leioach described tnl Interview shim en

November 26, 1975, as a "star chamber proceeding."

A total

of eight SSC Staff personnel plus one senator participated

in the questioning of him.

Deloach particularly found

Staff Member Michael Epstein to be "extremely vicious" in

his questioning and Deloach also used the terms "accusatory"

and "denunciatory" in describing Epstein's manner. As an

example, Deloach advised that Ipstein told him that the FBI

disclosed, by way of reference,

the one-time existence of

Asso. Dir. _ a particular memorandum from Deloach to Mr. J. P. Rohr,

Dep. ADAm. - another former FBI official.

Epstein told Deloach that the

sp iDI. - SSC had been trying to obtain a copy of the memorandum from

Admin..

- the FBI but that the FBI had been unable to locate it
