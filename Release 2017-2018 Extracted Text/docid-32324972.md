point, this Informant stated that it was his understanding that in discussing

merger proposals with the UAW, International Officials of the UFEMWA had demanded

as one of their points that all members expelled from various Locals of the

UFEMA would remain expelled subsequent to any merger that might be consummated.

It was the belief of this Informant that JOSEPH WEBER, Urganizational Director

of: the Farm Equipment laten, was behind this strategy.

CG0-5097 reported that he recently. overheard an official of the McCormick Works

call BRUNO BARINICK a Communist traitor to his face and, according to the Infor-

mant, BARTNiCK dia not dony this charge. U

On June 2, 1945, Confidential Informant I-l made available a pamphlet published

by the Committee for thé UAW-CIO' affiliation which indicated that the Inter.

national Harvester Company was attempting to cut wages in the plant and the

Farm Equipment Union was doing nothing about it.

On July 5, 1945, CGO-5496 made available a leaflet issued by the Executive

Board of Local 108 in which it was admitted that the company was attempting

to cut; the wages of employees in the MeCormick Works Plant and a strike threat

was made in this pamphlet in the following words:

iwe are serving notice on the company and their stooges that' no one

is going to bust our union and cut our wages."

It will be noted that a strike in the MeCormick Works immediately followed the

publication of this threat.

On June 19, 1945, CG0-5053 reported that a sitrike was started un June 18, 1945

at the McCormick Works, Lucil 108 and that this strike had been instigated by

the following individuals.k

CLARENCE STOCKER, Firancial Secretary

TONY MATURAK, Recording Secretary

JOHN MARCINO, Menher of Grievance Committee

MOORE (colored)

All of the above namel individuals have been reported by Informants of the

Chicago Field Division as active Communists in Local 108. According to CG0-5051,

these individuals went from one department to another in the McCormick works,

telling the people to stop work but not to leave the

shop and by so-doing, they

would be paid for their time,

even though they were not working.

This Informant,

stated that the Communists in Local 108 definitely instigated this strike and

it was the belief of this Informant that the strike was called in order to

impress UAW sympathizers in Local 108 with the strength'of the Farm Eauipmer

Union.

This Informant stated that while the official attitude of the treM
