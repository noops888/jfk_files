Re San Francisco letter to Bureau dated 10/14/76.

PROGRESS LETTER

2/587

Since referenced progress letter was submitted,

the San Francisco Division has continued to follow the

activities of LCN Member JIMMY FRATIANNO and others closely

associated with FRATIANNO through investigation and maintaining

close liaison with the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD)

Intelligence Unit.

The San Francisco Division has also developed

a source of information, CSSF 8678-C, at the San Francisco

Hilton Hotel which is frequented by FRATIANNO and San Francisco

Teamster Official RUDY THAM.

During the later part of 1976, FRATIANNO and RUDY

THAM, prominent San Francisco Teamster Official, leased a

clothing store located at 2076 Mission Street, San Francisco,

California, for the alleged purpose of selling discount

clothing.

A strong possibility exists that the store is a

front

for illegal activities such as stolen property, etc. and

the current ongoing investigation is directed at determining

any illegal activities associated with the clothing store.
