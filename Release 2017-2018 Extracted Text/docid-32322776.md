Letter to SAC, Dallas

RE:

WILLIAN JAMES LOWERY

100-385617

CONFIBENTIAL

NONE

Molina, a former Texas School Book Depository

employee, was questioned on 11/23/63 concerning assassination

of President Kennedy

Following this, a Dallas television

station commented on the police interrogation of Molina and

added that according to the Dallas Police, Molina had a

subversive record in that department. Moline is now suing

the Dallas television station.

He is not known to us to

have had any subversive associations; however, the Dallas

Chapter of the American

i G.I. Forum, a veterans group

comprised principally of

Mexican-Americans, was subject of

cp infiltration. Molina had

been ant communst and at no

testimony seeks to establish Molina's membership and

activities in the Dallas Chapter of the American G.I. Forum

during the time it was infiltrated by the CP.

Furthernore,

the defense anticipates developing evidence that would tend

to show Molina had knowledge of the CP infiltration.

DI. 1-S

and DL 6-S were cognizant of the CP efforts to infiltrate

the Dallas G.I. Forum/and were known by Lowery to be CP

a members •

Reairtel states the trial may take place in

approximately a month.
