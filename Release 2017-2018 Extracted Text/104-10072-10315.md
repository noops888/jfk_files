I. The purpose of this dispatch is to raise what we believe

to be an operational prospect worth careful study. The proposal

is necessarily sonewhat tentative at this point, but we belleve it

is desirable to share it with Headquarters now in order that its

early consideration may be facilitated.

Jhas developed excellent contacts

with individuals active in the Paris SNCC group. Identity A, who

is one of these, has recently becone Increasingly active in the

affairs of the SNCC group (which largely centers around several

young girls recently arxived from the US) and has come to play a

Father important sole since she brings to it a sophistication and

Identity A would not nomally have become active in the SNCC group.

She is older and holds "noderate" views of the sort held by the

late De. Martin Luther King- However, she recently took a rather

militant position at a public discussion of civil rights (primarily

to avoid confrontation with and critician by the SNCC girls) after

which sbe was admiringly besieged by the girls who were anxious to

have her assistance in preparation of speeches, ete.

In tha

regard please see Reference. Partly because she has the time and

partly because she was flattered, Identity A accepted and has grown

reports that Identity A is charming, highly female,

definitely intelligent and something of an "actress" in that she is

often willing to tell people what they want to hear; indeed, this is

what she did at the public discussion mentioned above.... At the same

time she is committed to the civil rights movement.

You will note

ron the biographical data which we are forwarding under separate

cover, that she has worked in civil lights activities before and at

one point assisted in the organization of a march led by DI. King-

who is a personal friend of the fanily (she is divorced

and has a teenaged girl) in addition to being the representative of

her publisher, has gotten to know her very well over the past years..

He reports that she is basically a loyal, moderate and anti-Communist

person who comes from a middle class family in Detroit where her

pareats were active la the anti-Communist activities of the United

anto Workers... At one point

had proposed her: for possible

use since she might be able to gain accesa to lorth Vietnam. This

was rejected, however, because she was thought to be too moderate,.

respectable and pro-American to be of interest to the North Vietnamese.

4. All this has been altered by her recent involvement in the

SuCc actiwities, and it is non

apinion that she offers

what way-be a unique opportunity to obtata the collaboration of

someone In a position to report on the attempts by Commist, Castro

ist, and radical forces to Influence and use the civil rights move

nent.: Through her involverent in SNCC she has developed contacts

with vacious groups which are flirting with Succ such as the French

Is convinced that Identity A would be willing to

collaborate with her government but stresses that the approach to

her would raguire great skill and mat ba done by an individual with

whos she coald feel rapport. He reiterates that she is sincerely

anti-Comunist, and that she does not share the beliefs of the

militant black racists, although she certainly is a convinced ad-

vocate of the civil lights struggle. L

suggests that any

approach to ber ust stress respect for her coumitment to the civil

rights novement. This approach should emphasize that Commnist

exploitation of the novement is in the interest of neither the nove

ment nor the nation and should request her collaboration in report-

Ing on foreign (and only foreign) attempts to exploit the situation.

As an alternative to this direct approach, we believe that consider-

ation should ba given to the desirability of merely stating that

virtue of having less blow-back potential should our approach be

declined and we would hope that once a relationship with her had

been established she would volunteer information on SNCC and its

foreign involvement. Reinforcing the approach

be attractive to her since she is somewhat lazy-

she is now living

on a grant fron Identity s which la designed to give her the finan-

cial independence to write another book. However, she has done no

writing yet and is begiming to be concerned regarding her source

of income when the grant expires at the end of the year.

- Time is of great importance in any approach to Identity A

in

New. He stresses that the is becoming concerne

regarding future income and nay soon begin withdrawing from SNOC

activities in order to begin writing. More importantly, her normal

instincts may soon lead to a falling out with Identity C and other

radicals who are active in SNCC. If this happens it can be expected

to severely reduce her access. Were she in contact with WOrIR™,

however. such arguents vith targat personalitles could be avoided

through carefal vOrIaN guidance..

8. Thus we are presented idth that appears to be an opportunity

to gain a collaborator who might be able to provide information of

the highest interest regarding coumnist efforts to use SUCC, and

who night be able to gain access to various other radical groups

at least abroad, seem to be yirtually unapproachable and thus this

opportunity way be alnost unique. At the same time, thece appears

to be a rather critical time factor operative here.

9. In addition, rather Andamental questions are ralsed by

this possibility, which will certainly require careful consideration

prior to any approach to Identity. We are impressed with the

thoroughness of

assesment of this operational possibility

and belter it warrants serious consideration by Headquarters We

have no reports regarding the impact of the assassination of Dr.

Martin Iuther Ring on Identity A and the other members of the sNcc

group although our guess is that it will only accelerate forces

now in operatios and render more important, even critical, the

consideration of this proposal:
