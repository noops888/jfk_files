Renyairtel 2/5/52, and reBuairtel 2/7/62.

•on 2/19/62, Special Agent JOHN SUWARTZ, Intelligence Division,

IRS, Pittsburgh, Pa., advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III as

follows:

SCHWARTZ was in Chicago, Illinois 2/14-16/62, awaiting his

curn to testify as a Government witness in the case

J. EZHAYA, et al; ITSP-MT."

SCHWARTZ that he expects to use

AUSA MANION. Chicaso, told

"BERNARD

former Miami

CI, as a witness for the Government, and It is fully believed

that defendant WILLIAM RABIN will take the stand and impli-

cate his co-defendants, Including SAMUEL MANNARINO.

It is noted that both MEROLA and RABIN have been associates

and friends of the MANNARINOS for many years.

The above

information from Schwartz was furnished the same day by SA

FORSYTH to Departmental Attorney JOHN MULLANEY.

MULLANEY stated that he believed that it would be better to

postpone the interview of DANIEL HANNA at Federal Penitentiary,

Lewisburg, Pa., until after MEROLA and RABIN testify.

sald he felt that the testimony of these two men might be

a selling point with HANNA

to demonstrate that others were

"turning on the MANNARINOS to save ,themselves."
