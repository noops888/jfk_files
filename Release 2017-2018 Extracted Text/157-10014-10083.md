Mr. Scelso.

The DDP was Mr. Helms.

I might add that all statements I make in this matter

are based on purely my memory, because I had little or no

contact with the Dewald investigation, the kentedy Investigation

after the end of 1963, and I have not reviowed any records at

all except the few documents which you showed me this morning.

Senator Schweiker. Was this because of a transfer of

duty or assignment or what?

MI. Scelso.

It was because the investigation was turnes

over to another staff in the Agency, to the Counterintelligori:

Staff. I can explain why it was turned over in much more

detail if you'd like.

Senator Schweiker. Well, maybe briefly, if you would.

MI. Scelso. I was put in charge of the investigation in

the first place because of the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald

had been in Mexico, and the foreign entanglements seemed to

center there. Also, I was put in charge of it because I na:.

Mr. Johnston. Now, let me ask you. MI. Rocca, who followiu

you with the Kennedy case, dates his involvement as about Januady

23rd, 1964.

Mr. Scelso. That is possible. The turning point came

when I finished an initial report on the case and distributed

It to the people who were concerned within the Agency.

Mr. Johnston. How large was that report?.

Mr. Scelso. Oh, it might have been 20 pages long, and

summarized all of the things which we had discovered abroad.

Just at the time that this report was being finished and was

being circulated, Mr. Nicholas Katzenbach notified the igo:.

that the FBI OI Department of Justice report on the case was

finished, and invited the Agency to send representatives"to

I would like to add that in the initial phase of the

investigation, when I was commissioned with the job, Mr. Kelms

called me and Mr. Karamessines and Mr. Angleton and a number of

others into his office and told them in the clearest terms

possible that I was to be in charge of the investigation, that

no one in the Agency was to have any conversations with anyone

outside the Agency, including the Warren Commission and the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, concerning the Kennedy assassi-

nation without my being present. I was to be told and given an

opportunity to go to everything.

I did talk to members of the Warren Commission. I am

certain, although I cannot prove it, that Mr. Angleton througie

the entire period

discussed the Kennedy assassination regularl;

with tBI representatives, never notified me of any of these

meetings, and never passed on

to me any of the information th.:

he gained

in these meetings.

Mr. Seelso. well, Mr. Angleton was the Chief of the

Counterintelligence Staff and had almost daily meetings with the

FBI representative, the liaison officer to us, Mr. Sam Papich.

These meetings were held in MI. Angleton's office.

The fBI did send us hundreds of reports of miscellaneous

people during this period, most of whon were by the very nature

of things not even involved in the case, but reading Katzenbach's

report I for the first time learned that the FBI was in

possession of diary-like material which Oswald had had in his

possession and was found after the assassination.

I learned for the first time that Oswald was the man wic

had taken a pot shot at General Edwin Walker, two key facts

i1:

the entire case. All the ballistic evidence was there, and

countless ocher pieces of information. one of this had evur

been passed to us.

Senator Schweiker, What timeframe was that that you saw

this report, roughly?

Mr. Scelso. I saw che report

MI. Scelso. It dealt with a summary of the Mexico City

situation -

Senator Schweiker.: Did it deal with his aotivity in the

Soviet Union?

Mr. Scelso. No. Just the fact that he had been there,

because we knew next to nothing about it. See, we had.in our

possession - I had in my possession at that time only the

fragmentary information which we had gotten at the time from

the Navy Department when it was realized that Oswald had

defected.

Senator SChweiker. Did the report deal, for example,

with the polygraph test that was given to Alvarado?

MI. Scelso. Yes, I think so, yes.

Senator Schweiker. The person who alleged that there was

a $6500 payoff?

Mr. Scelso. Yes, yes, I am sure it mentioned that. It

mentioned the Alvarado case.

Whether it mentioned the fact

that he had been polygraphed, : don't recall.

Was he, do you Iccall, was he

I might add, senator, that I was the first polygraph

On a number of

occasions during my operational career, I had to take over

In very, very major cases, and I just felt at the time Alvarado

was polygraphed that the man that they sent down there - I don't

Senator Schweiker. And so when you say the results of the

polygraph test was unclear, in your mind it was unclear becaus::

question.

In view of the polygraph test being unclear, what kind of

conclusion or analysis did you put in your 20 page report is

to the authenticity or not authenticity or lack of authentici::

of Alvarado's testimony?

Mr. Scelso. I and my staff came to the conclusion that

Alvarado was a fabricator.

Senator Schweiker. Now, why did you do that in view of til

test being unclear?

Mr. Scelso. Well, Alvarado confessed to Mexican authorit.

later that he had fabricated this.

MI. Scelso. I don't think that we knew. I am pretty sure

we didn't. We had never heard of Alvarado before he popped

up in this case, and the Nicaraguans came to us either in

Mexico City or in Nicaragua.

Senator Schweiker. Well, we saw some report and maybe

this will help refresh your memory, maybe it was an FBI report

saying that - I thought it said that CIA had used him in the

past and he was

80 percent reliable, whatever that means.

Mr. Johnston. Let me clear that up. The confusion is chu

deletions in the FBI report. The true fact was that he was

an informant for Nicaraguan intelligence, and they suid he

was 80 percent reliable. Nicaraguan intelligence told CIA

that he was 80 percent reliable.

Senator Schweiker. He was not our infurmant.

Mr. Johnston. He was not oûr informant.

posing as a alesident Nicaraguan, and he frequented the 'Cuban

embassy and consulate, trying to get a visa to go to Cuba. He

obviously had been in this building and in the courtyard of it

because he could describe it. That was part of his mission.

He reported regularly to his Nicaraguan case officers in

Mexico City about what he was doing. After the Kennedy

assassination became news, public news, Altarado went to his

Nicaraguan contacts and told them

that back in October of that

year he had been in the Cuban consulate, I believe, and had

there sean Lee Harvey Oswald, whose picture by that time had

been on television in Mexico, and had scon him in conversation

with a group of people, among them a sei-headed Negro, and

had boasted that all of them were too cowardly to carry out

some mission but that he would do it. And a sum of money was

mentioned - I don't remember the sun of money. Was it

$ 3000?

Mr. Johnston.

$6500.

MI. Scelso.

$6500, something like that, some $3000 stuck.

in my menory.

But this puzzled us uitil I think ve learned from our

station in sexico City that Mexican radio stations had broaur.:

amony the hundreds of faces and nonfacts that they were puert.

out about the Kennedy assassinacion, had mentioned or had a

stacement that Oswald had been discovered to have a savings

Now, the fictithat oswald' a picture, had seen on television,

the fact that this amount of money had been mentioned on the

radio, and the face that this Nicaraguan source, Alvarado»

had not reported this incident in any way, shape, or form, back

An October when he had allegedly seen this occurrence in the

Cuban consulate, but had only come up with this after the

Kennedy assassination..

Senator Schwelker. In other words, he didn't report it

to his intelligence service when it occurred.

MI. Scelso. No, he didn't.

MI. Johnston. Just let me clear one fact up for the

record. His report was that he saw Oswald on September 19th.

not in october.

Mr. Scelso. Yes, something like that.

Mr. Johnston. And I reviewed the record, and I just want

to be clear that one of the reasons CIA had for discounting nis

story was the FBI information that Oswald was in New Orleans c..

September 19th.

Ms. Scelso. That's right, that's right. That comes baci:

to me non.

Mr:

wallach. Let's go off the record for a minute.

(Discussion off the recorá.)

Senator Schweiker. Excuse

me. Now, you were explainii:

to me why jou felt, in spite of the incomplete results, why

you discounted Alvarado.

To me, in my judgment, and as an interrogator of some

a lot of them were fabricators, and a polygraph operator who

of fabrication in the early years before we cleaned our payrol:

although I was not privy to these operations, and I do know

that either then or afterward in that time, historical span,

Fidel Castro used to allege, Cuban propaganda used to allege

that we were sending agents ashore to kill Castoo. To my

knowledge at that time and to my later knowledge wher. I was

in a higher capacity in the Agency and reviewed all of the

Agency's clardestine oporations regularly, I did knon that

were sending in paramilitary groups attempting to place agen...

abroad to do all kinds of things, but not that they attempte:

we don't do anything like that.

And it would be impossible in an Agency like our own,

because you couldn't do anything like that without leims or

indeed the President's approving it. That was the tone of

everyone's conversation.

fact that the Agency had engaged in plots to assassinate.:

Ms. Scelso. I certainly think that that-would have been

become an absolutely vital factor in analyzing the events

surrounding the Kennedy assassination.

Mi. Johnston. If I add to that the fact that on October

29th, 1963 Mr. Fitzgerald met with this Cuban and

assured hir

as a personal representative of Bobby Kennedy that his scheme

for the overthrow of Castro, possibly Including Castro's

assassination, had the highest U.s. support, would that have

been a major fact?

Mr. Scelso. It certainly would.

MI. Johnston. And let me add to it, the reason I asked

you about the name traces that are on Mexico cable 7045, the

name of the Cuban that they were meeting with onnvovember 22:a

is included in this cable, and that a name trace on him, if

conducted, as you say, would have led to his file which

indicated the meeting and the assassination plot.

Senator Schweiker. And it also might have indicated

well, this is very debatable, but it might have indicated wier?

that the Cuban government might have been behind the assassi

MI. Scelso. We weighed this possibility, and at the

that possibility.

that at that time I had the Panama riota of January 1964 on

Castro had talked to an AP reportor by the name of Daniel

Harker on September 7, 1963, and threatened to eliminate or

that he threatened retaliation?

Did the CIA conduct an investigation to determine whether

or not there was Cuban involvement in the assassination of

President Kennedy?

Mr, Scelso. Yes, to the extent that you could see it on

Mr. Wallach. I think there is a distinction

investigation to determine if a country. a foreign country was

involved in the assassination of one of our Presidents.

Mr. Scelso. Yeah, Ilve heard it fourth hand, and you've

heard it third hand.

Mi. Johnston. My question was more directed at the fact

that while you were involved, did you have a feeling or a

sense that there was a major effort to determine whether the.

Soviets were somehow behind Oswald?

Me. Scelso. Yes.

dir. Johnston. Did you have an equal sense

of an effort

to determine whether the Cubans were behind Oswald?

Mr. Scelso. No, not a corresponding effort.

Mr. Johnston. Arid is that in part due to the fact that

Mr. Angleton was such a strong personality and dominant in the

Agency?

Mr. Scelso. Well, in the early stages Mr. Angleton was

not able to influence the course of the investigation, which

was a source of great bitterness to him. He was extrenely

einbittered that I was entrusted with the investigation and i:

wasn't. I was equally embittered because

I had plenty to du

anyway, although I was proud of having the assignment. Angle:.

then sandbagged me as quickly as he could, and I had --thru..

would be a matter of cructal International Importance.

ME. Scelso. Well, aside from the varlous obvious ones

that he realized thas it would soflect very prarly on the Agency

and very poorly on him, and that it might indeed turn out that

the cubans dad undertaken this assassination as retailation for

our operations to assassinate Castro, this would have a

disastrous effect on him and the Agency, I think those are the

obvious human explanations, plus the fact I think Mr. Helms,

knowing me, would have had some concern about my reaction to th

revelation because he knewwhat kind of person I was.

MI. Wallach. What was explained to you as your juris-

dictional basis for investigating? I mean, that is sort of a

legulistic term.

How was the investigation explained to you in terms of

what the FBI was doing, what the CIA was doing, just your

general, overall understanding?

Mr. Scelso. Well, my overall understanding, Mr. Helins

told me in the presence of these others that I was in charge

of the investigation, that everybody was to feed all informa:.

to me. I was to report directly to hin, that no one was to

hold any meeting with anjbody else outside of the agency on

Kennedy assassination without my being present, and that ci

course was violated fron

you made*

It is my understanding

that

the CIA is not a law enforcement agency.

Did Mr. Helms at any time discuss with you what allowed

him to ask that anninvestigation be conducted?

Mr.. Scelso.: No, that wasn't really necessary because I

was thoroughly fanillar with the ground rules affecting our

operations internally and externally. He had in our area,

my area, countless operations targeting

which

were worked out elaborately within the ground rules. Helms

was very, very flem on his insistence, which came up from

time to tine, that we do not operate

of the United States unless we are specifically requested to

by some other Government agency which is empowered to do so.

Mr. Wallach. I think somehow my question has been mis-

stated.

we have been told by persons familiar with Cuban activitin:

there, including people at the JMWAVE station, that it was

their belief, whether they were told of not, that this.

investiyation was within the ambit of tie FbI, and that they

were not investiyating the assassination of President jennce:

Mr. icelso. I think that they meart and that was

You see, with the receipt of the FBI report with the

in the Soviet Union, this scope of the investigation was fai

greater than I could handle from my position as chief of thi:

very satisfactorily investigated the Mexican aspects of it, iu:

Oswald because we got regular -.:the FBI sent us copies of ai:

of their reports on people that might be of interest to us.

Including Oswald, and masses of stuff. These reports had not

they had because,.of course, we knew Oswald had been in Mexico.

Maybe we did get it, but I know they never came across my desi.

personally. And we knew, of course, that an FBI special aye::

was meeting Oswald at infrequent intervals to find out how

Senator Schwelket. A sexual relationship.

Mr. Johnston. And the Dorticos and Armis telephone call,

there was a question of whether the Mexican police talked and

asked Duran about having sexual relations with Oswald. In 1967

for some reason, Silvia Duran said publicly, or at least

through a source, that she had had sexual relationg with Oswald

while he was there.

Mi. Scelso, I draw a complete blank on. that. I certainly

think I would remember if it had been alleged, or we had

believed there was any substance to it.

Senator Schweiker. The other question or the list was, vil

Oswald ever travel to Cuba from Mexico City?

Do you know why that question might have been put on the

list, and does that refresh your memory about any possible

trip that Oswald made to Cuba?

Mr. Scelso. We weld have asked the Mexicans that so

that they would check their records to see if he had gone

from Mexico to Cuba.

This was because of

Mx. Scelso. Yes, although I am not sure what significance

it might have had. The Mexicans were always -- the Cubans

were always shooting people in and out of the country in strange

way's. The link fron Havana to Mexico City by air was at that

time the only air connection that Cuba had to the Western

Hemisphere. And countless people, important foreigners, nevs.

No.

Mr. Johnston. I don't have any more questions.

I want to thank you very much for coming back for this.

Mr. scelso, Hell, you know, I don't do anything anyway,

and I"m very glad to come back.

involvement in some of these activities, it is so reprehensible

and unforgivable.
