WHERE SHOT

On January 22, 1962, PSI

(protect), Miami, Florida, a Cuban refugee who

maintains contact with anti-FIDEL CASTRO elements in Cuba

and who has furnished reliable information in the past,

advised that on January 20, 1962, he had a telephore conversation

with members of his family in Havana, Cuba.

also advised that OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ is still employed as

a clerk in the files of Cuban G-2, Havana, Cuba, and that

she is considering seeking political asylum in

the U. S.

in the event it is possible for her to arrange for clan-

destine transportation to the U. S.

PSI stated that legal

transportation (via established

airlines) from Havana,

Cuba, to U.S, for her is impossible, inasmuch as she does

not have a permit from the local police in Havana to leave

the country, and efforts to obtain a visa waiver for her

would only make it known to the authorities that she is

considering defectig.

PSI further stated that OLGA DIAZ is the daughter

of FRANCISCO DIAZ and ANA MARIA

X SUAREZKPENA.

She was born

in Regla, cuba! PsI further stated that DiAz has never ubl

been in the U.S.A., but that her sister, ONDINA 'ISABEL

26E SUAREZ', has been in the U.S.A. and was active in the

of July Movement in the Miami area and New York.

On January 20, 1962, PSI JUAN MACHADO, Miami, Florida,

a Cuban exile residing in Miami, Florida (protect), who

maintains contact with pro and anti-FIDEL CASTRO elements

in Cuba and in Miami, Florida, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised that in a communication

which he has received from his family, he has learned that

OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ has recently moved from her former

residence in Regla, Cuba, and that her present residence

is not known. DIAZ is still employed by Cuban G-2, and

there are no indications that she has been under suspicion

subject to arrest.

The communication to PSI intimated

that attempts are being made by DIAZ to obtain transporation

via a fishing vessel from Havana, Cuba, to the U.S.A.

PSI further stated that DIAZ has never been in the U.S.A.,

but that her sister, DELIA ONDINA ISABEL SUAREZ, was in

the U.S.A. on a number of occasions in 1957 and

1958, and

that. she was active in the 26th of July Movement in the

that a search of the

explained that most of the

ecords of the hotel are destroyed

after one year, and that shé does not believe that the

records for the year 1958 are complete.

A check made at 127 Southwest 9th Street, Miami,

Florida, on January 18, 1962, reflected that there is no

longer a house located at that address, that it has been

raziedl and replaced by a parking lot and commercial estab-

Lishment, and inquiry in the neighborhood failed to disclose

anyone who has any information concerning the occupants

of that address in 1958. PSI MACHADO advised that

although OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ apparently has moved from her

former address located at Calixto Garcia (#71, Regla, Cuba,

..some of her relatives still reside there, and have knowledge

of the present residence address of OLGA DIAZ: She may be

reached at telephone number 90-61-633, Havana.

•PSI MACHADO and PSIL

both of whom

have known the family of OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ and her sister,

DELIA, for over 20 years, are convinced that OLGA DIAZ

SUAREZ is serious in her

attempt to defect and seek poli-

tical asylum in the U.S.A.

stated although

OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ was formerly pro-CASTRO, she has become

disillusioned with the regime of FIDEL CASTRO, inasmuch as

the regime is communist.

Both sources advised that OLGA

DIAZ SUAREZ is not active in the almost non-existent

underground in Cuba, and that she has chosen not to be

active in order to avoid having the attention of the

Cuban authorities attracted to her activities.

Inasmuch as the Bureau can be of little or no

direct assistance to OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ in her defection,

it is recommended

that the Bureau consider referring this

matter to CIA.

(U)

UACB, the Miami Office is not taking any further

action in instant matter.
