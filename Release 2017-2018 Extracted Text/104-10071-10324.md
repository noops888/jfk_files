1. During the reporting period the LIANCHOR leftist

writer press service produced 35 individual articles and

serialized political feature articles which were distributed

to 20 newspapers throughout Latin America and are known to

have been published regularly by at least 12 newspapers.

Despite this acceptable production rate, the project has not

achieved the objectives set for it by the Mexico Station and

EFFECT IVENESS

Views on LIANCHOR Effectiveness by Owner/Director of

Guatemala Dally "EL IMPARCIAL":

During

_saster visit to Guatemala City

he was told by the owner of "EL IMPARCIAL" that tha

newspaper was only interested in publishing

articles.

The newspaper owner stated that

a well-known personality in Guatemala and also wrote l

interestingly.

The owner also said that he had pub

I1shed one

series by Identity-4 because Identity-4 was

a Guatemalan who at one time had been important.

the owner pointed out that the other LIANCHOR writers

were unknowns and did not write well.

He singled out

Identity-3 as being a "menace to journalism" because much

of what she wrote amounted to libel or slander..

The "EL IMPARCIAL" owner sald that he received

the newspapers "EL DIA" of Honduras,

"LA PRENSA GRAFICA"

of El Salvador, "LA PRENSA" of Nicaragua,

"LA REPUBLICA".

"LA ESTRELLA" of Panama and "ULTIMAS

selected partly because of their leftist records (Iden-

titles 3, 4,

and were prone to submit

manuscripts with texts politically

harmful to the image of LIANCHOR.

Confused political

thinking and poor writing resulted in rejection of over

20 manuscripts during February April by,

flected in their writings.

After the agent dusted off and mailed out several of his
