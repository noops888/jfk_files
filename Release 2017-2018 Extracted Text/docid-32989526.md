(E) • STREAMLINING PROCEDURES - CHANNELIZING MEMORANDA -- Numerous

channelizing memoranda, particularly in large offices operating a

large number of live informants, are presenting an increasingly

critical space problem and demands for extra file cabinets.

In June, 1960, the Chicago and San Francisco Offices

were authorized to

destroy channelizing memoranda following

submission of reports in security cases on an experimental basis

to determine the feasibility of adopting this practice throughout

the field.

Based upon the favorable results obtained in these offices,

particularly in savings in file space and streamlining or case files,

the Bureau is authorizing the destruction of these channelizing

memoranda following submission of reports in both individual and

organizational security cases.

In devising procedures for the handling of this matter

you should be guided by the following:

(1) The current procedure with regard to filing the

original informant report, the filing of the master channelizing

memoranda in the informant file and the serializing of channelizing

memoranda in the substantive case files will be continued

as at

present.

(2) The Agent, at the time he dictates the report, will

• prepare a

memorandum listing the channelizing memoranda to be

destroyed by serial or serial scope and requesting the Chief Clerk's

Office to destroy. The memorandum should indicate that pertinent

Information contained in the serials to be destroyed was incorporated

in the report. It will not be necessary to set forth in this

destruction memorandum the file and serial number of original

Informant reports or master channelizing memoranda as this information

will be listed in the cover pages to the report. In the case of

multiple volumes, the destruction memorandum should be prepared by

the Agent in sufficient numbers so that one copy will appear in

each volume of the multiple volume file being stripped.

(3) Prior to destruction, the Agent's recommendations

with respect thereto are to be reviewed and approved by the

Supervisor at the time he reviews and approves the report.

(4) Following destruction of the channelizing memoranda

the Chief Clerk will so note on the memorandum. Thereafter, the

memorandum will be filed in the case file as a permanent record

of the serials destroyed.

(5) Technical and microphone surveillance channelizing

memoranda may be destroyed without the necessity of identifying

in the cover pages of the report the exact location in the office

riles of the original information. The use of an asterisk

identifies the source and the original information can be readily

located.

The channelizing memorandum should not be destroyed in

the following

instances:

(1) When the original information is not contained

elsewhere

in your office.

(2) Do not destroy serial one of a file regardless

of its nature.

(3) Do not destroy any serial containing indexing.

It would appear that if indexing was necessary to channelizing

memoranda, such indexing would only be done in the main case

file as set forth in the title of the communication.

(4) Do not destroy serial showing "action" information.

For example,

opening, closing, posting, or instructions given

• by a Supervisor to an Agent concerning the case.

The destruction of these channelizing memoranda should

be subject to close supervisory control by you to insure that all

pertinent information contained in these memoranda is reported

in the investigative report.

true intelligence information on the underworld.

You should carefully evaluate this situation in the

(A) - LABORATORY MATTERS - PHOTOGRAPHY OF EVIDENCE -- The FBI

Laboratory has noted a growing tendency of investigative personnel

and similar evidence Cecause to sit done to

heel print,

covered by this camera, It is often impossible to record the

entire area that must be photographed on one negative, making

it necessary to record the evidence by sections on several

separate negatives.

In some instances even individual signatures

or heel impressions have been reproduced in this manner. Such

photography unnecessarily complicates examinations in the

Laboratory and may hinder or limit the use of such evidence in

a court of law.

Every field division has available Speed Graphic

- cameras equipped for document photography which can be adjusted

to include an entire document or other evidence in one negative.

lo properly record evidence photographically, the Speed Graphic

camera should be used whenever the area to be photographed is

greater than 24 by 34.

This matter should be brought to the attention of all

investigative personnel, and it is expected that in the future

documentary and similar

evidence will not be recorded photo-

graphically by sections merely because it is more convenient

to use the Fingerprint Camera. Of course, where large numbers

of documents are to be photographed, the field should continue

to use one of the 35 mm or other camera units designed for

document photography.

(D) _ REPORT WRITING - SECURITY CASES -- It has been noted that

• on occasions some field offices fail to include in security

reports information previously submitted for dissemination by

letterhead memoranda.

Apparently this omission is made on the

theory that to include it in a subsequent report would be

repetitious and an unnecessary expenditure of time. Page 33,

Part I, FBI Handbook, Indicates the results of investigations

in security cases should generally be submitted in reports,

and page 31, Part I, FBI Handbook, defines

a report as a

written document containing the results of an investigation

as of a certain date.

According to this definition, a report

should be complete in itself and should contain all

pertinent

and material information obtained since the submission. of a

previous

report or since the inception of an investigation.

This is being called to your attention so that in

the future there will be no misunderstanding and all field

offices will, when submitting reports in security cases, include

succinctly all pertinent and material information previously

submitted for dissemination in letterhead memoranda. You are

also cautioned that letterhead memoranda containing information

which will later be placed in reports should only be submitted

when it is believed expeditious dissemination of the particular

information must be made and time is of the essence.

These instructions are intended to amplify and not to

change in any way present rules relating to report writing.

advance warning of possible brake failure and when such warning

the need for constant re-evaluation of our informant coverage in

Informants of this type should be developed not only to obtain

new cases for prosecution but for utilization on a long range

basis in order to provide continuous intelligence information

concerning organized crime.

Through well-placed informants we

we have been able to penetrate the Communist Party and other

In April of 1960 the New York Office exercised

excellent initiative in recognizing that a pattern of activities

in the United States favoring African nationalism was emerging

and in instituting a semiannual reporting procedure to present

an over-all picture of such developments.

Several field offices

were drawn into this reporting procedure; however, the recent

of this type taking place in the various Bureau field office

territories. In this connection, therefore, the Bureau desires

to utilize this file to collect

a concise and factual over-all

picture from all field offices of just what pattern is developing

in the activities of African nationals in the United States and

in the activities of individuals and groups here who seek to

exploit the issue of African nationalism. It must be borne in

mind that the increasing influx of African students, who are

attending educational institutions throughout the United States,

requires we be most alert not only to agitational and organi-

zational activities of

the students themselves, but also to

the problem of uncovering pressures brought to bear on them

and/or efforts to organize them by nationalists or subversive

elements or by representatives of other nations.

In view of current developments in captioned matter,

reports should be submitted by each office on January 15,

April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year until further

notice.

Eight copies of reports should be furnished to the

Bureau. After reports are submitted which will afford an

over-all picture of the situation confronting each office

negative reports should not be submitted but a letter should

be submitted indicating there is no change in the existing

picture.

This file should be utilized as a control file

to present a concise picture of the problem. It is not

designed as a catchall for reporting individual case activity.

Any data warranting investigation of organizations, groups or

Individuals should be handled in separate case files and only

that data pertinent to showing the over-all picture should be

repeated in this file.

Information concerning racist activities

in the United States which are unrelated to African nationalist

activities should not be included in reports in this case.

(J) CUBAN ALIEN REFUGEE REPORTS -- Bureau has arranged for

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) offices Locally to

furnish copies of reports pertaining to Cuban alien refugees in

the United States to Bureau offices at field level.

These reports

generally contain brief identifying data concerning the allen

including his whereabouts at the time he was interviewed by INS.

They are normally submitted on INS Form I-161. While active

investigation of these individuals is not desired in the absence

of allegations indicating they are procommunist, pro-soviet,

anti-American, pro-Castro or are engaged in activities which

would bring them within our investigative jurisdiction, they

represent an excellent potential from whom intelligence information

can be obtained and sources of information developed.

Offices receiving these reports should carefully review

• them with the thought in mind of interviewing the alien refugees

on a selective basis for the purpose of developing intelligence

data and assessing their potential as informants or sources in

Cuban matters.

is realized that many refugees may not have

information; however, you should bear in mind that if there is

an indication a refugee was involved in counterrevolutionary

activities he probably has information concerning such activities

in Cuba.

If refugee was Cuban official, it would be logical to

expect he would have information concerning communist and Soviet

orientation of Castro officials. Likewise, if he was in public

relations field he could be expected to have data dealing with

Cuban propaganda activity. Prior to conducting such interviews,

review your office indices and if the data received from INS or

the data located in your files indicates that a check of Bureau

files would be desirable prior to the interview, then an expedite

check of Bureau files should be requested. Sufficient back-

ground data should be furnished to facilitate this check. Your

Interviews should be designed to determine the full scope of

each refugee's knowledge and this should be clearly shown in

reporting the results of the interviews. This will enable the

Bureau and any other field office having a direct interest in

the data to request additional information on specific points

where desirable.

Pertinent concrete Information elicited from the

refugees would be of interest not only to the Bureau but also

to other Government agencies. For this reason you should submit

the results of such interviews under an appropriate caption in

a form suitable for dissemination, submitting nine copies to

the Bureau.

Where warranted, appropriate investigations should

be instituted on the basis of data obtained from these refugees.

There is no need to obtain Bureau permission for these interviews

unless some unusual circumstance exists. Advise the Bureau of

the results of all interviews conducted.

(A) FBI SUGGESTION PROGRAM - In connection with the Bureau's

Suggestion Program, It has been noted that a number of suggestions

have been received

which,

although they appear meritorious on

the surface, actually would create more paper work or other

administrative burden than they would relieve if adopted.

This

Is not meant to discourage creative thought on the part of our

employees, but should be borne in mind when considering the

merits of each proposal.

In addition, where savings of a tangible nature are

anticipated through the adoption of a suggestion, a statement

Indicating, as far as possible, the amount to be realized in

savings should be set forth in

the suggestion or accompanying

comments. This is necessary so that the suggestor may receive

due consideration for recognition under the Incentive Awards

Program 1f his suggestion is adopted. In the past, it has

been necessary on occasions for the Suggestions Desk to go

back to the Division where the suggestion originated and have

this point covered. This causes delay in processing the sug-

matters requires specific clearance with the FBI.

In view of

INS objectives and in view of

the tense Cuban situation clearance

should be granted upon request unless INS investigation of a

(A) NONDISCRIMINATION - GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT POLICY - GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS -- By Executive Order 10925 dated March 6, 1961, the

President abolished the President's Committee on Government Employ-

ment Policy and the Government Contracts Committee and in lieu

thereof established the President's Committee on Equal Employment

Opportunity.

The President reaffirmed the policy that there be

no discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment

in the Federal Government or with contractors doing business with

the Government and delegated to the new committee the authority

to implement this policy. A copy of the Executive Order is enclosed.

As regards rules for effectuating the policy and

provisions of Executive Order 10925 throughout the Department, the

Attorney General by Departmental Order 239-61 dated March 17, 1961,

reaffirmed regulations in this regard prescribed by the Departmental

Order 105-55 dated November 21, 1955•

specified that all

references in that Order to the President's Committee on Government

Employment Policy shall be deemed to be references to the President's

Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity.

This instruction by the

Attorney General means there is no substantive change in provisions

for complying with the nondiscrimination program. Manual revisions

are being prepared.

At this time I want to strongly remind you of the prime

importance of insuring that each applicant for any Bureau position

is given consideration based entirely on his merit and fitness and

without regard for his race, color, religion, or national origin.

In view of

the ever-increasing challenges facing the Bureau and

our country, it is absolutely imperative that we make the best use

'of the human resources available so as to assure that our responsi-

bilities are discharged in the best possible manner.

This requires

alertness and application at every level of our recruitment program,

from contact with possible applicants through interview and investi-

gation, to insure that the

best qualified are eventually extended

appointments.

You should emphasize this to all personnel who have

occasion to participate in handling Bureau applicant matters.

I

shall continue to expect you to implement this policy and to make

certain that the best qualified applicants for Bureau positions

anywhere in the service are referred to the Bureau for appropriate

consideration.

File No.

(A) NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - The Increasing anti-United States

"cold warland demonstrations stemming from the Cuban situation and

tensions are cause for concern and must be taken fully

into account in connection with our investigative efforts.

There has been recent evidence of hostility and

belligerence on the part of

pro-Castro Cubans during attempted

Interviews by Special Agents.

The Bureau has also received data

Indicating that the Communist Party of Mexico planned violent action

against Special Agents of the FBI and Americans in Mexico. Sub-

sequent data indicated the Communist Party of Mexico planned to

prepare black lists of Americans in Mexico, to identify Special

Agents of the FBI and agents of the Central Intelligence Agency

and place them under surveillance, and to seize Americans and

them as hostages in the event of war with Russia. Plans

were made to conduct surveillances of members of the Communist

Party of Mexico suspected of being informants. A war of nerves

was contemplated involving planned damage to property and sabotage

with wide-scale sabotage efforts planned in the event of war,

including the organization, arming and training of militia Irom

farm and labor elements to be used to defend Cuba if necessary.

This hostility and the grave steps contemplated undoubtedly

were

touched off as a part of an emotional reaction to the invasion

of Cuba by anti-Castro elements. They are, however, clear evidence

of what we should be prepared to contend with now and in the event

anti-United States tensions increase.

The planned actions of the

Communist Party of Mexico demonstrate forcefully the capacity of

a subversive organization to react militantly to an emergency

situation.

The activities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee

in the United States reveal clearly the capacity of a nationality

group organization to mobilize its efforts in such a situation

so as to arrange demonstrations and influence public opinion.

Each Special Agent In Charge should assure that investi-

gations and interviews related to nationality group activity are

conducted with due caution and careful consideration of the safety

of personnel handling this work. Care should be taken not to

provoke hostility.

Border offices should be particularly cautious

in view of the militant hostility and reported plans of the Com-

munist Party of Mexico.

The existing situation is such that all field offices

must be most alert to the possibility of demonstrations by

nationality groups which could lead to incidents involving

(B) PERFORMANCE RATINGS -- A review of the annual performance

ratings recently submitted clearly indicates that rating and

reviewing officials have not completely familiarized themselves

with instructions set out in the Manual of Rules and

Regulations,

Part I, Section 5, pertaining to performance ratings. Further-

more, in evaluating employee performance many rating

and review-

ing officials have failed to give due consideration to such

important matters as disciplinary action, limited duty, voluntary

overtime and the weight program.

obvious some ratings

had been written without sufficient preparation and care and

had not been thoroughly reviewed before being transmitted to

the Bureau. This resulted in needless delay in processing the

ratings, as well as in unnecessary correspondence. Responsibility

for the

proper evaluation of employee performance and the ac-

curacy of performance ratings rests with the rating and reviewing

officials and hereafter they will be held strictly accountable

for every error, deviation from instructions and failure to

• properly evaluate the employee's performance.

The following are some of the items which have been

the source of considerable correspondence and are being set

for your future guidance.

forth

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 35

## Page 36

(1) Failure to give due consideration to administrative

action taken against an employee during the rating period.

Certainly an employee who has been the recipient of several

letters of censure or has been the subject of more severe

•administrative action during the rating period is not entitled

to an adjective rating of Excellent.

(2) Failure to give due consideration to the physical

condition of an employee.

It should be obvious that a Special

Agent who has been on limited duty during the greater portion of

the rating period is not entitled to a satisfactory rating in

physical fitness nor 1s he entitled to more than a Satisfactory

adjective rating since he cannot perform all of the duties

required of a Special Agent and his assignments must be controlled.

It is the personal responsibility of the rating and reviewing

officials to insure that employees with physical limitations are

properly rated.

(3)

Some rating and reviewing officials have not given

due consideration to the employee's efforts to comply with the

Bureau's weight standards and to equitably share the work load.

It is difficult for the Bureau to understand how an employee who

has not complied with the weight standards or whose overtime has

been consistently below the office average can be rated excellent

or outstanding in attitude.

(4) There have been a number of instances in which

ratings afforded employee on the rating guide and check list

and/or the narrative comments have not supported the adjective

rating afforded the employee.

In some instances the ratings

on the rating guide and check list have been inconsistent with

the narrative comments. The fact that an employee is rated

excellent or outstanding on the majority of the items on the

rating guide and check list does not automatically entitle him

to an Excellent adjective rating.

It should be obvious that

although all of the items on the

rating guide and check list

are important, some of the items, such as attitude, judgment,

initiative, accuracy, industry, productivity, knowledge of duties,

investigative ability, development of informants and sources of

information and reporting ability, are of particular Importance

in evaluating employee performance and must be carefully con-

sidered in arriving at the adjective rating.

(5) There have been a number of instances in which

the ratings on the subelements on such items as investigative

ability, reporting ability, executive ability and ability on raids

and dangerous assignments did not support the over-all rating

on the particular element. If an employee is to be rated

excellent on any one of these elements he must be rated excellent

or outstanding on the majority of the subelements or the nar-

rative comments must clearly reflect the reason why

the employee

1s considered excellent in the particular item. If an employee

is to be rated outstanding on one of these elements he must be

rated outstanding on each of the subelements in which he is rated.

not complete or the information submitted was misleading.

this regard the Manual of Rules and Regulations specifically sets

out information which must be included and questions which must

be answered. Rating officials who have followed the format and

answered the questions outlined in the Manual have experienced

little difficulty in the preparation of performance ratings; how-

ever, those who erroneously assume a complete knowledge of the

regulations invariably submit incomplete and inaccurate ratings.

Particular attention must be given to the specific comments

required on police instructors, sound men, resident agents,

accountants, language ability, disciplinary action and admini-

strative advancement to insure that complete and accurate

information is set out. In regard to disciplinary action it

is imperative that the

administrative action, including the date of the action and

the reason for it, and specifically note the items on the

rating guide and check list which have been affected by the

action.

(7) If an employee is a relief supervisor and has

been used in

this capacity during the rating period he should

be rated on item 21, executive ability, and if he has not been

used in this capacity during the rating period the narrative

comments should so indicate.

(8) In those cases in which there has been a

deterioration in the employee's performance or serious defi-

ciencies are noted it is the responsibility of the rating and

reviewing officials to submit a cover memorandum with the rating

setting out recommendations for appropriate action.

(9) It is imperative that ratings be prepared in

sufficient time to reach the Bureau by the due date which is

reflected in the Manual of Rules and Regulations and that a

rating be submitted on each employee when due. Performance

IDENTIFICATION MATTERS - FINGERPRINTING SUBJECTS OF FBI

CASES - A number of field offices have written in concerning

the new "Prisoner Record and Reporting System" placed in

operation February 26, 1961, for W. S. Marshals and Bureau of

Prisons institutions.

As a result of this system, two marshals

have asked FBI to either fingerprint each Federal prisoner

twice or route fingerprints through marshal headquarters in

the arresting area whenever subject is released by a u.s.

Commissioner or Federal juage before marshal has opportunity

to take custody.

I am strongly opposed to duplicate fingerprinting

and also delays which would occur if arrest fingerprints taken

by FBI cleared through marshal before being received by

Identification Division.

These objections were voiced to

Executive Office for U. S. Marshals which agreed to our stand:

It was pointed out that. Special Agents of the FBI do finger-

print incidental to an arrest whenever the person apprehended

is released on bond or otherwise, or it appears that he will

be released before being placed

In custody of a marshal.

We

should insure that this 1s done in each instance. Indicate

on the reverse side of the fingerprint card three copies of

reply for marshal in

district of apprehension. This conforms

with procedure already in effect whereby all U. S. Marshal

fingerprint cards are answered in triplicate. Show city and

state where correspondence is to be sent. Upon receipt, .

marshal will retain one copy of record and will deliver one

(E) - NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - CUBA -- The f'ailure of the

recent invasion attempt by Cuban rebel forces has accentuated

the problem of investigating anti-Castro and pro-Castro groups

and individuals in the United States. In addition to dis-

charging our security and criminal responsibilities we are

faced

with the necessity of acquiring and providing other

agencies informative and valid intelligence data relative to

the objectives and activities of both factions as well as data

regarding key personalities. Key field offices handling Cuban

matters have been instructed previously to give continuous and

preferred attention to all phases of Cuban activity.

In order to discharge these investigative and

• Intelligence responsibilities with maximum effectiveness it

is essential that particular attention be afforded the develop-

ment on a broadly expanded basis of sources and informants in

a position to provide knowleageable data regarding pro-Castro

and anti-Castro activities.

The need for broadened coverage

in the anti-Castro field by the FBI is quite evident when it

1s recognized there is as yet no firm indication of the extent

of guidance and direction, if any, which will be afforded anti-

Castro activity in the United States by other agencies of the

U. S. Government. Any pertinent developments in this regard

will be brought promptly to your attention in order to assure

proper coordination.

data is

at neutralizing or disrupting their activities.

During a conference held at the Bureau May 8 and 9,

1901, attended by representatives of 10 field offices which

handle the bulk of the Bureau's

that this program of harassment and disruption has been suc-

cessful and the conference concluded that it should be continued

and, if possible, expanded in the future. It was noted

particularly that the Soviet-bloc intelligence services

are

very sensitive to adverse publicity and it was considered

desirable to foster such publicity wherever possible in the

future. You should, therefore, continue to furnish to the

(G) SECURITY INDEX -- It has been suggested that in the case

of Security Index (SI) subjects the labor union affillation,

This matter was discussed at a recent Internal Security -

Espionage Conference held at the Bureau and attended by

repre-

sentatives of 16 field offices. It was the opinion of the

Conference that the listing of

such information on the SI cards

would materially facilitate any future surveys that need be

conducted in connection with infiltration of subversives into

: labor unions.

This matter should be handled as the cases are opened

for semiannual verification of residences and employments. If

it is determined that a subject is affiliated as either a

member or officer of a labor union, that information should be

set out on form FD-122 under the heading,

"Employment" and sub-

mitted to the Bureau in order that such may be added to the

SI cards.

CUBAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES - The

Castro regime has received a tremendous boost as a result of its

defeat of the

anti-Castro forces during the recent invasion of

Cuba.

Castro's prestige has risen not only among his followers

In this country but also throughout many of the Central and south

American countries.

His followers in the United States have

benefited prestigewise from his victory and as a result we have

had

a resurgence of pro-Castro activities, particularly involving

the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

We can expect this activity to

Increase, particularly in the intelligence, and propaganda fields.

One of the major problems in our Cuban work is that of

Intelligence activities. Heretofore Cuban intelligence activities

in this country have been aimed primarily at the various

anti-

Castro groups.

The continued drift of cuba into the soviet orbit

and the continued dependence of the Cuban Government upon Russia

and its satellite countries for economic and military assistance

could conceivably result in the undertaking by Cuban intelligence

of activities against the United States itself. We must be

prepared to meet any such threat.

Perhaps the most effective means of fighting this Cuban

intelligence problem is through good source, informant and double

agent coverage:

Since the break in United States - Cuban relations

In January, 1961, we have been hampered to some degree by our loss

oi special coverage on cuban diplomatic establishments in Miami,

New York and Washington, D. C. Other sources have compensated for.

this loss to some degree; however, we cannot fulfill our obligations

unless there is a continuing effort to develop new sources, informants

and double agents who can keep us abreast of developments in the

Cuban intelligence field.

One phase of this coverage which warrants special mention

1s that of double agents. There is a definite need for improvement

in this type coverage and the Bureau expects key offices involved

in Cuban work to lead the way in the development and utilization

of double agents.

The Bureau believes that the present time would

be ideal to infiltrate double agents into the pro-Castro ranks.

Individuals utilized could use approach that although they have

been anti-Castro in the past they are now disenchanted with the

leaders of the various anti-castro groups; they do not agree with

the United States role in the recent invasion of Cuba by anti-Castro

forces; and they now feel that Castro's policies are best for Cuba.

One special segment of present anti-Castro individuals who might be

utilized along these lines are those who have recently returned from

anti-Castro training camps abroad. These individuals might have

a special appeal to the pro-Castro forces since many of these

individuals are ostensibly disheartened by the recent unsuccessful

invasion of Cuba.

The problem of Cuban intelligence activities can be

solved only if the field offices involved afford these cases

vigorous investigative attention and have coverage which will

supply needed data.

The Bureau expects that field offices

Involved in Cuban work will keep on top of this situation not

only that we may discharge our own investigative responsibilities

(B) INTERNATIONAL SERVICES OF INFORMATION FOUNDATION, INC.

(ISI) --

The ISI, which has its headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland,

and an office in Elizabeth, New Jersey, was organized in 1946. It

1s headed by Ulius Louis Amoss, a former colonel in the Air Force.

A number of other former officers in various branches of the Armed

Forces of the United States are listed as officers in ISI, and,

according to one official, former military officers are used to

solicit contributions to finance the organization's activities.

These individuals reportedly are paid a 25 per cent commission on

all funds they collect.

ISI is a private intelligence agency which publishes a

-pamphlet entitled INFORM for distribution to its subscribers. Data

appearing in the pamphlet appears to be a rehash of old information

which has been given a sensational slant. Amoss formerly was

connected with the Office of Strategic Services and Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), „

and the latter group has described him

as a

"flop and fabricator.

A limited investigation on both ISI

(G) COMMITTEE FOR NONVIOLENT ACTION - SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT OF

1948 -- Recently the Committee for Nonviolent Action (CNVA)

circulated copies of a leaflet captioned"THIS IS THE SAN FRANCISCO-

TO-MOSCOW WALK FOR PEACE."

The leaflet contained a statement of

'proposed action"

and urged recipients to consider "Not serving

In the armed forces and not registering for the draft."

The contents of the leaflet were taken up with the

Department and the Department's reply stated:

"It is our view that the publication

and/or distribution of copies of the leaflet

might, under some circumstances, be in

violation of 50 U.S.C. App. 462.

However,

we do not believe that investigation of this

matter would be warranted unless it becomes

apparent that the organization is making a

concerted effort to persuade particular

registrants,

or those required to register

under the Universal Military Training and

service Act, to evade military service.

We

would appreciate being advised of any infor-

mation of that nature that may come to your

attention."

In view of the Department's opinion if Information

is received indicating the organization is making a concerted

effort to persuade registrants, or those required to register

to evade military service, furnish the information to the Bureau

your attention is being directed to existing instructions concerning

the prompt dissemination of information of interest to other

governmental agencies.

Even though reports in the Criminal Intelligence Program

are disseminated only to the Department, there has been no change in

the instructions as to dissemination contained in part 2, section s

of the Manual of Rules and Regulations. Dissemination to other

governmental agencies required under this manual section must be

handled on a

timely basis

and you should insure that all agents

are thoroughly familiar with this section of the manual. If any

instances should arise where you consider dissemination inadvisable,

the Bureau should be promptly advised.

As you are aware, the Department of Justice has sought the

cooperation of other investigative agencies of the Federal government

in furtherance of the Attorney General's attack on organized crime.

As a result, other agencies, particularly the Internal Revenue

Service, will be investigating notorious hoodlums and racketeers who.

are also being investigated under our Criminal Intelligence Program.

You will already have disseminated to Internal

information received indicating a possible tax violation on the part

of these subjects. If Internal Revenue Service or another Federal

investigative agency seeks further information from you, there is no

objection to your disseminating such information under the provisions

of the manual

section previously referred

to provided, of course,

such dissemination will in no way interfere with the Bureau's

interests.

Where time is of the essence or where the information to

be disseminated is relatively simple, there 1s no objection to this

dissemination being made orally.

A proper record should be made in

your file covering such dissemination.

If, however, the material

is voluminous, an appropriate dissemination memorandum should be

prepared in keeping with existing instructions and copies of such

memoranda should be supplied to the Bureau.

You will, of

course, recognize that as your investigation

progresses additional information which should be disseminated may

be developed.

It would also appear that as you are advised by Internal

Revenue Service or another Federal investigative agency as to develop-

ments in its investigation of a subject, information in your file not

previously disseminated may become sufficiently pertinent to warrant

held at the Seat of Government (SOG) provided an extremely valuable

exchange of ideas and a sounding board to resolve mutual problems.

Agents attending these conferences exhibited an excellent knowledge

of their subject matter, which enabled informative and stimulating

discussion of the activities of the organized hoodlum element in

this country. The free exchange of ideas and investigative

techniques gained through experience in criminal intelligence

matters proved beneficial to all in attendance.

The following were some of the major areas covered in

these discussions:

PROPOSED LEGISLATION

Keen interest was evidenced in some of the provisions

of proposed legislation which would enable the Bureau to carry

current investigations to a logical prosecutive conclusion. It

was emphasized that the Bureau must now lay necessary groundwork

in contemplation of the passage of proposed legislation in order

that we will be in a position to move swiftly and efficiently

when our responsibilities in this field are extended through a

broadening of our jurisdiction.

Proposed legislation to combat organized crime and

racketeering: now before Congress, comprises generally eight

proposals which will either create new legislation or extend

current legislation over which the Bureau has investigative

jurisdiction.

Proposed legislation covering interstate and foreign

travel in support of racketeering enterprises would prohibit

travel in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of

distributing the proceeds of any unlawful activity; committing

any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity; or other-

wise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the

promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of any

unlawful activity.

The term unlawful activity is defined as

any enterprise involving gambling, liquor, narcotics, or

prostitution offenses or extortion or bribery in violation of

A proposed amendment to the Obstruction of Justice

statute would broaden this statute to make it a violation for

any Individual by force, threats, or injury to endeavor to

intimidate any person who had furnished information to, or from

whom Intormation had been sought, by any investigative agency

## Page 53

of the United States. It would also make it a violation to wilfully

furnish false and misleading information to any investigative agency

of the government.

Proposed legislation covering the interstate use of wire

communications for wagering would make it unlawful to lease, furnish,

or maintain any wire communication facility with the intent

that it

be used for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of

bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest or to knowingly use •

such facility for any such purpose.

Proposed legislation covering the interstate transportation

of wagering paraphernalia would make it unlawful to transport inter-

state any record, ticket, certificate, bill, slip, token, paper,

writing, or other paraphernalia designed for use in bookmaking or

wagering pools with respect to a sporting event or any numbers,

policy, bolita, or similar illegal games.

A proposal compelling testimony in certain labor racket-

eering cases would compel a witness to testify and afford him

immunity against self-incrimination regarding matters on which he

is compelled to testify in connection with the Hobbs Act (inter-

ference with interstate commerce by extortion or robbery) and

Section 302 of the

Taft-Hartley Act (bribes by employers to union

representatives).

Proposed

amendments to the Fugitive Felon Act would

broaden this statute to include all crimes punishable by death or

imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under the laws of the

place from which the fugitive flees. :

A proposed

amendment to the Johnson-Preston Act, covering

Interstate Iransportation of Gambling Devices, would enlarge the

description of gambling devices to include any machine or mechanical

device designed primarily for use in connection with gambling. This

proposal would also enlarge the category of persons to whom

registration and filing provisions apply; it would grant immunity

in specific instances to individuals involved in order to secure

their testimony, and would extend the act to include transportation

in foreign commerce.

It is emphasized that the above provisions are strictly

in a proposal stage. however, a general knowledge of the contents

of these proposals shoula be of value in shaping your investigative

BROADENING OUR INTELLIGENCE BASIS

It was concluded at these conferences that we must extend

our intelligence coverage through the various echelons in the

organized underworld to complement highly concentrated coverage

we have attained and are perfecting on the top leaders of organized

crime in this country. Our investigations have identified the top

men to date as falling generally in older age groups.

When these

leaders are removed by prosecution, death, or normal

underworld

attrition, it will be necessary to be aware of the makeup of the

younger element who will replace them. Our position, both Irom an

Intelligence standpoint and in consideration of future prosecution,

will be greatly enhanced if we obtain this broader coverage of

hoodlum groups at various levels.

In view of the possibility of our jurisdiction being

extended to cover interstate gambling operations, it is also

Important that we develop a well-rounded picture of the integral

functions of major gambling operations which would be of interest

under the Interstate Gambling Activities classification. This will

require that all offices are fully aware of the makeup, operational

detail, and control of large scale gambling operations within their

making use of interstate wire communication facilities for

gambling purposes. As previously pointed out, these investigations

will be aimed primarily at the top gamblers and hoodlums in control

of such operations, and we cannot under any circumstances conduct

Investigation of a

legitimate news service or other completely

legitimate communications firm.

Other special groups which should be designated for special

attention are labor racketeers who are influencing or controlling

labor unions, either directly or through intermediaries, and hoodlums

who specialize in the domination of racket activities on the United

States water fronts.

...

'INFORMANTS AND CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES

It was generally agreed that the most productive and

valuable coverage achieved to date in the Criminal Intelligence

Program has been through the establishment of highly confidential

sources in key locations. Such sources have provided insight

.. Into the organized hoodlum element which was unavailable through

other means.

From results obtained to date, there can be no

question that such sources are invaluable and that our efforts

should be concentrated on the establishment of additional comparable

•he estab11shment

sources in order to afford a more complete picture of the inner

workings and relationships of various hoodlum groups.

6/6/61

SAC LETTER NO. 61-31

NW 55044 DooId: 32989526 Page 54

## Page 55

Experience has shown that the most complete and

intelligible information is obtained from a combination of highly

confidential sources and live informants.

Each operates as an

Invaluable adjunct to the other, as demonstrated by some of the

best criminal intelligence operations we have in existence in various

cities to date. Fragmentary Information obtained from a highly

confidential source, when interpreted and further identified through

well-placed live informants, has become meaningful and extremely

significant in our tracing of hoodlum activities. Conversely,

isolated bits of information initially furnished by live informants,

when fully exploited through the establishment of a highly confidential

underworld activities.

For these reasons, the importance of both of these types

of sources cannot be overemphasized, and every effort should be made

to improve our coverage in both areas.

With regard to the development of new live informants,

you should be constantly alert and ready to fully exploit any

opportunity offered to develop as informants highly placed members

of the organized hoodlum element. It is recognized that the

development of such an individual may result in unusual conditions

or requests being presented by the potential informant.

such

situations should be evaluated in proportion to the individual's

potential value in this program, and the possibility of developing

a live source on an upper level of the organized hoodlum element

should not be dismissed arbitrarily.

COORDINATION OF INFORMATION OFFERING PROSECUTIVE POTENTIAL

AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

conferences was the goal whereby our criminal intelligence investi-

gations will reach their culmination in successful prosecution of

the leaders of organized crime.

Additionally, we must insure that our investigations are intelligently

planned and sufficiently thorough that we will develop any possible

violation of Federal

law over which this Bureau has investigative

jurisdiction.

We must also be prepared to take full advantage of

any new legislation which would provide the Bureau with extended

jurisdiction to effectively combat the organized hoodlum element.

HOODLUM ACCOUNTS IN SWISS BANKS

The problem of tracing hoodlum funds was discussed and

It was determined that information has been developed in a number

of offices that top hoodlums are using numbered accounts in Swiss

. banks to maintain concealed cash reserves.

Extreme difficulty

has been experienced in developing full information concerning such

accounts because of Swiss laws guaranteeing the secrecy of these

accounts.

In such instances, where it appears that a subject is

dealing with foreign banking

institutions, investigation should be

conducted at correspondent banks in this country to determine if

records of pertinent transactions may be available at the

correspondent bank.

THUMBNAIL SKETCHES

Discussion concerning the availability of a ready

reference on hoodlums under investigation made it apparent that

there is a need to maintain in each office a brief sketch on all

hoodlum subjects under investigation throughout the Bureau.

use of the caption

WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

PROSECUTIONS UNDER THE

• ZINTERNAL SECURITY ACT OF 1950

On June 5, 1961, the United States Supreme Court upheld

the constitutionality of the registration provision or the Internal

Security Act of 1950 and ordered the Communist Party, USA, to

register with the Attorney General as a communist-action organization.

In view of the definite possibility of prosecutive action against

the Party and against selected Party officers and members should

they fail to register as ordered, the Bureau desires to reiterate

and

enlarge upon instructions previously issued in No Number SAC

Letter J dated October 19, 1951, captioned "Communist Party - USA

(Brief), Prosecution of Communist Party Functionaries under the

Smith Act.

Since it is a cardinal rule of evidence that conversations

between a subject and his attorney are in the nature of privileged

• communications, technical and microphone surveillances in operation

on Communist Party functionaries arrested for violation of the

Smith Act of 1940 were discontinued immediately following such

arrests.

Notwithstanding this fact, the possibility was recognized

that occasions might arise when conversations between subjects and

their attorneys, or between the attorneys themselves, might be

intercepted by technical or microphone surveillances

which continued

In operation on unrelated individuals and/or organizations.

Accordingly, the field was instructed in referenced No

Number SAC Letter J that should such conversations occur,

they were

to be completely disregarded by the

employees assigned to technical

and microphone surveillance coverage.

Such conversations were not to

be monitored and no record whatever was to be made of their occurrence.

While it is true that the Department has not as yet

furnished the identities of those Party officers or members who will

be prosecuted should they fail to register, the Supreme Court

decision is being widely discussed in Party circles and it is

possible that Party leaders and/or members may be in communication

with attorneys regarding defense plans and strategy on the possibility

an indictment might be returned against the Party as an organization

or against themselves as individuals.

Therefore, the instructions

set out in No Number SAC Letter J are being reiterated and emphasized

MW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 73

K.,

as applying to possible prosecutions under the Internal Security

Act of 1950 and

are to be placed

into immediate effect.

The

question of the discontinuance of specified technical and microphone

surveillances will be faced when the necessity for such action

OCCUrS.

In addition, the possibility also exists that confidential

Informants, particularly those operating on a high level in the

Party, may be present when defense plans are being discussed by

Party attorneys.

The first time an informant attempts to report

Information of this nature, he should be advised that the Bureau

does not desire to receive

such information and the informant

should not, in the future, attempt to report it.

been a tendency by some field offices to submit plain text rather

than encoded teletypes in instances involving the Criminal

Intelligence Program and other type cases where the Bureau's

operations and investigations could be

seriously hampered or

Impaired if the teletypes were intercepted by unauthorized

persons.

You should immediately instruct responsible personnel

In your office that teletype messages of this type should be

encoded

and remind them of current rules and regulations involving

matters of this type as set out in the Manual of Rules and Regu-

lations, Part II, Section 4G, 4b.

(D) CONFIDENTIAL VOUCHERS - SECURITY INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL

INFORMANTS -- In the audit of confidential vouchers it has been

noted that a substantial number contain errors which either require

a suspension or the return of the voucher to the field office for

correction.

In order to keep to a minimum the number of errors in

confidential vouchers, the following items are set forth for your

guidance:

RECEIPTS

in aRi

1. Receipts for payments to informants should be obtained

in all instances if possible.

In the event a receipt

cannot be obtained for a particular payment, complete

circumstances should be set forth on the blue slip at the

time reimbursement is claimed.

2. Receipts reflecting payment to informant should clearly

reflect the date of payment, purpose, that is, whether for

services.or expenses or both and the amount for each.

The

period covered should be shown when the informant is paid

on a period basis and the name of the Special Agent from

whom the money was received.

The receipt must be signed

by the informant receiving the money and should not be

witnessed by another Agent.

3. If necessary to make corrections on the receipts,

such

corrections must be initialed by the informant and not the

Agent.

• BLUE SLIPS

1. Each blue slip prepared in connection with payments to

Informants should reflect date of payment, Bureau case title,

date of the authorization under which the

payment was made,

period covered and purpose of payment.

2. The first blue slips submitted in connection with a

payment to an informant who has previously been used by

another field division should reflect the identity of

the other field division when known.

3. Vouchers and blue slips in the name of either the

SAC or the ASAC must be signed by him personally.

The

name appearing on the voucher and the name appearing

on the blue slip must always be in agreement. The

signature of the payee on the voucher must be In

agreement with the typed name of the payee as reflected

on the face of the voucher.

The above should be called to the attention of all employees

of your office who have occasion to make payments to confidential

informants or sources as well as those employees who handle the

preparation of confidential vouchers:

As you are aware, upon request the Bureau must make

available to the Federal courts receipts covering payments to

informants who are used as witnesses.

In view of this, It 1s

Imperative that receipts be submitted in good order. Unless

Immediate adherence to the Bureau's regulations concerning the

preparation and execution of receipts is effected, it will be

necessary to take administrative action against those employees

who do not comply with these instructions.

(E) OFFICE SOCIAL ACTIVITIES -- I wish to emphasize the personal

responsibility incumbent upon each division head to see that any

outside social or recreational function sponsored by a divisional

office is not attended by persons who may

' potentially cause

embarrassment through their attendance at such functions. Each

division head should be alert to see that no undesirable persons

are invited to such functions and that they be held at respectable,

KIDNA PING AND MAJOR CASES

DUTIES OF #1 MAN

The #1 Man is the immediate assistant to the Inspector

or person in charge of the case and serves in the capacity of executive

officer, taking whatever action is necessary to implement the instructions

of the Inspector.

In the absence of the Inspector or official in charge, the

#1 Man is to supervise and be in charge of the entire investigation. To

carry out this responsibility there must be a close working arrangement

between the Inspector and the #l Man so that both are fully informed at

all times.

Generally the Inspector should see everything coming

in on the case, including memos, letters and other communications,

while outgoing communications can usually be handled by the #1 Man.

Of course, any outgoing communication of importance or unusual

significance would be brought to the Inspector's attention. In addition,

the #1 Man reviews all incoming material prior to the assignment of

leads and preparation of lead cards so that he has a complete knowledge

of all the facts in the case and the action being taken to develop further

information.

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 79

## Page 80

Among the various duties performed by the #1 Man are

the following:

1. Receive official telephone calls pertaining to the case.

2. Consult with Agents and key personnel on matters not of sufficient

importance to be brought to the immediate attention of the Inspector

in charge.

3. Plan and supervise the investigation.

4. Assign leads.

5. Assign duties to the Night Supervisor.

6. Keep current notations during the day on all major developments

and have them available for the Inspector in charge or Bureau official.

7. Supervise matters assigned to him by the Inspector.

8. Keep informed of all developments and keep Inspector in charge

current of all developments.

Usually the #1 Man would have the following personnel and

operations under his direct supervision:

• 1. Report supervisor

2. Lead supervisor

3. Night supervisor

4. Personnel officer

5. Equipment supervisor

stenographer should be located nearby so that important matters can be

placed on record immediately.

Immediately upon reporting at the office handling a major

case, the #1 Man should confer with the Inspector and then follow up to

see that the various administrative assignments are made to provide for

the proper handling of the case. In this regard it probably will be

necessary for the #1 Man to confer with the personnel in key positions

to insure they understand their duties and to clarify any particular

problems or procedures.

Thereafter, the #1 Man should immediately

review all pertinent developments in the case so he will have complete

information concerning the developments to date and be in a position to

carry out his responsibilities.

REPORT WRITING

The work of a report writer on a special assignment falls

into three general categories:

I. Assembling and preparing reports on the case.

2. Preparation of a daily teletype summary to the Bureau.

3. Other special projects assigned by the Inspector of

Agent in charge of the case.

I. REPORT WRITING

Generally speaking, reporting investigation conducted by a

special squad follows the reporting procedures set forth in the Manual

for other cases. However, there are certain suggestions which can

be followed which will facilitate the report writing.

1. Do not wait to write long reports on a variety of

subjects. It makes for better reports and is easier for reference

purposes to limit each report to one phase of the investigation or

even a part of one phase. For instance, the first report in a

kidnaping case might well cover the predication and initial

investigation, another report cover the investigation at the crime

scene, another on the background of the victim and family, another

on miscellaneous suspects and other reports on various phases of the

investigation as they develop. It is probable that near the end of

the investigation, as the case begins to come to a close, reports

will be written covering a variety of subjects.

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 83

---

## Page 84

2. Even though it may seem unnecessary at the

beginning, a table of content for each report will prove helpful.

The more that the table of contents is set out in detail, the

more helpful it will be.

3. Because of the manner in which leads are assigned,

it is unnecessary and actually of no use to set out leads in reports

written while the case is being handled by the special squad. A

short statement that leads are not being set out but are being

assigned and handled as developed should appear in the administrative

section of each report.

4. Dissemination of copies of reports to other offices

will depend on the circumstances of each case. If the case appears

to have nation-wide ramifications, it would be well to send one

copy of each report containing the basic facts to each office so

that it will not be necessary to repeat this information as later

leads are set out by teletype or airtel. In some cases, this

dissemination can be limited to offices in the general area of the

country surrounding the office of origin. In any event, it is not

necessary to provide widespread dissemination of later reports

dealing with specific projects as the investigation progresses.

Copies of these reports can be limited to offices which are known

to have an interest in that particular phase of the investigation.

- 2 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 84

---

## Page 85

5. Leads for other offices will usually be set out by

telephone, teletype, airtel or letter. While other offices should

be expected to advise the results of their investigation by a

similar communication, they should

also be instructed to report

the results of their investigation in regular report form. It

would be a mistake to allow auxiliary offices to RUC investigation

by letter or airtel since the office of origin would soon become

bogged down in paper work.

6. The office of origin should have additional copies of

each report run off for working copies. These can be bound in file

covers by the clerks and made readily available to agents on the

squad without the necessity of having to charge out a file each time

it is necessary to refer to a report. They will also be available

for squad members to read in their spare time, if any, in order to

familiarize themselves with the case. These working copies should

be accounted for and destroyed when the special terminates. The

number of working copies prepared will depend on the size of the

special squad. Four copies have been lound to be sufficient for

a squad of from twenty-five to thirty-tive men.

T. Usually considerable work will have been performed

by the office of origin before the special squad arrives. In order

that reporting will be uniform and prepared properly, the report

writer should prepare a memo of reporting instructions to be

These instructions should be discussed verbally at the first

available conference of agents and should also be discussed verbally

with stenographers in order that any misunderstandings can be

clarified. These instructions should include the following items:

a. Interviews and other investigation conducüed

which can reasonably be expected to be used as testimony should be

reported on an FD-302. In many cases, there has developed a

tendency to use an FD-302 in situations where there is only a

possibility of the information being used as testimony. This

clutters up the report with a series of disjointed short items.

Exercise judgment in the use of an FD-302 and do not use it

indiscriminately.

b. Investigation conducted which does not go on

an FD-302 should be reported on a narrative type insert. It is well

to begin the insert with a short explanatory statement as to the

basis for the investigation conducted. For instance: "John Jones,

312 Main Street, Ins Angeles, California, was interviewed by SA

Thomas Smith, inasmuch as Jones' name had been found on a piece of

paper in possession of subject's wife." This not only makes the

report clearer but is also of assistance to the report writer in

preparation of the report.

c. Each narrative type insert should be limited

to one subject matter, since as mentioned above, reports will

usually be written about one phase of the investigation and each

WW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 86

---

## Page 87

report will be broken down into logical sections. The insert should

be dictated

in a form suitable to go into a report without change

or deletion. Do not includè administrative matters, etc.

d. All FD-302s and narrative inserts should be

prepared on stencils. The steno should be instructed to make two

proof sheets since it is sometimes necessary in complicated matters

to hand one proof sheet to an agent for assistance in covering leads

suggested by the insert.

White proof sheets are easier to read than

yellow sheets.

e. A 3 x 5 card should be attached to each FD-302

or insert which has on it the particular project or phase of the

investigation to which it applies. This assists the report writer

in segregating the stencils into appropriate sections of the report.

I. Each agent should dictate any leads suggested

by the insert or FD-302 he is submitting. These should be narrative

type lead cards in triplicate with a short statement similar to an

abstract, showing the predication for the lead. See memo on setting

up Chief Clerk's Office for example of this type of lead.

g. Each agent should indicate to the steno all

names, license numbers, serial numbers or any other data which

should be indexed and instruct the steno to prepare index cards

in duplicate.

8. Complaints received, suggestions: administrative

matters and other similar data which cannot go into a report

verbatim should be dictated in memorandum form. The number of copies

will depend upon the way the case is set up administratively,

-5 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 87

---

## Page 88

bearing in mind that in many cases a copy of the memorandum will

be necessary for a subfile. Therefore, a minimum of original and

two copies.

9. AS FD-302s, inserts and memoranda are typed they

should be delivered to the Inspector in charge or SAC immediately.

He and the number one man will read them and pass them on to the

lead supervisor who will remove and handle the lead cards. The

Inspector in charge or the lead supervisor will mark memoranda for

routing and they will go to the Chief Clerk for serializing and

routing. Stencil FD-302s and narrative type inserts go from the

lead supervisor to the report writer. The report writer should

then segregate them as to subject matter and use in the preparation

of the report. It will be recalled that there will be a duplicate

set of index cards attached to each stencil. Undoubtedly there

will be considerable information in the stencils which should be

in the special indices in order to be of use. In order to solve

this problem, the report writer will remove one set of index

cards and turn them over to the Chief Clerk. These will be

"red flashed" by making a small red pencil mark where the serial

number would ordinarily appear. This index card will then be filed

in the special indices. An agent seeing a "red flash" index

card with no serial number will then know that the material indexed

is on a stencil in possession of the report writer and can refer

to it there. When a report is prepared, the appropriate "red flash"

- 6 -

Nw 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 88

---

## Page 89

index cards are marked with the serial and page number. The

other set of index cards which had been attached to the stencil

is similarly marked and placed in the regular office indices at that

time.

In other words, in the interval between when a stencil is

prepared and when it finally is incorporated into a report, there

is an index card in the special indices with the special red

marking so that all data submitted by the Agents is indexed at all

times with no time lapse.

II. DAILY TELETYPE SUMMARY

A teletype should be sent to the Bureau each night

summarizing developments which have occurred during the day. This

is necessary even though the Bureau might have been informed by

telephone of developments. This procedure should be followed until

the Bureau instructs to the contrary. The report writer should

make notes during the day of developments which should be included

in this teletype and each night should confer with the Inspector

in charge prior to preparing the summary.

III. SPECIAL PROJECTS

The report writer is responsible for various "paper work"

projects and research which become necessary in a case and which

are usually assigned by the Inspector in charge. Examples of such

projects which have been necessary in some cases are as follows:

I. Memorandum to all Agents outlining certain phases of

the case with which they should be acquainted such as description

of property in possession of the victim,

explanation of the basis

=7-

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 89

---

## Page 90

for various investigative projects being conducted and similar

memoranda.

2. Communications to all offices or selected offices

outlining investigative projects desired and the basis for them.

3. Special research and file review projects desired by

the Inspector in charge. As an example, in one case an analysis

was made of the financial status of subject at the time of the

crime based on past earnings and expenses. In another case a

chart was prepared of the whereabouts of all subjects for the

pertinent period of one week for assistance in interviews and

checking their stories.

4 When the subject is identified, plans should be

made for the preparation of a prosecutive summary report. It will

assist in the preparation of the report it the report writer keeps

a rough drait compilation of evidence developed and the names of

potential witnesses so that when the time comes for the preparation

of the report much of the data will be available in outline form.

Summary reports are often required with a minimum of notice and

this procedure will assist in expediting the preparation.

PREPARATION OF RANSOM LIST

IN KIDNAPING CASES

INTRODUCTION

May it be stated here that this treatise is not

intended to be all inclusive but to be considered

as a supplement to well-established procedures

currently outlined in the Manual of Instructions.

OBTAINING FUNDS NEEDED

With the apparent ever-increasing amount of ransom meney

being demanded which is usually in currency of small denominations and

in consideration of the limited time element presented under the twenty-four

hour presumptive clause, and further, in consideration that the Subject may

make a payoff request within a very few days after the abduction, it has

become increasingly clear that obtaining funds in the quantity and type needed

for the best interest of the investigation is a major problem of paramount

importance.

Consistent with suitable banking arrangements available

and/or desirable to the victim's family and the Bureau case and depending

on the amount and type of currency needed, an early conference with a

member of the family and/or their banking representative should be held

to determine identities of persons who are responsible on the family side

for preparation of the ransom money and whether the proper type of currency

is readily available in amounts needed.

If not, immediate steps should be taken to obtain such money;

it being sometimes necessary to obtain funds from other Federal Reserve

Districts. Here, working directly with a Federal Reserve Bank can be very

advantageous. If it is necessary to sort a large volume of currency to insure

that all bills are of particular denomination of the ransom money or of the

same type and series, much more currency than the amount specified in the

ransom demand will be needed.

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 92

## Page 93

)

For instance, in a recent case three million dollars in bills

of ten and twenty dollar denominations were assembled and sorted to obtain

therefrom the necessary five hundred thousand dollar ransom. Here, the

expert staff of currency sorters employed in a Federal Reserve Bank were

not only extremely helpful but necessary and in a situation of this kind are

of inestimable value.

Such a conference as indicated above will often be valuable

in conveying to the family and its bankers an appreciation of the investigation

and evidentiary problems arising in these cases and avoids such instances

as recently occurred where a family banking representative thought that

just to fill a suitcase with currency of the denomination and total amount

demanded would be all that is necessary.

It was found in one recent case where the ransom demanded

was five hundred thousand dollars in ten and twenty dollar bills that the

local bank, although quite a sizable institution, could not supply these

funds, let alone in bills of the same Federal Reserve District as is some-

times desirable. Neither could the local Federal Reserve Bank of this

district supply the necessary funds of the type needed.

Calls to other Federal Reserve Banks determined they had

no such amounts on hand of the same series or type.

Finally, to assemble the required amounts in ten and twenty

dollar denominations, the local Federal Reserve Bank had to obtain funds

- 2 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 93

---

## Page 94

from another unit of the Federal Reserve System totaling some one and

one-half million dollars which, when combined with a like amount on hand,

provided the sorting staff with sufficient currency to make up the ransom

amount in bills of the desired type.

Here, the cooperation between Federal Reserve Banks

enabled the delivery by plane of the requested amount from a city some

seven hundred miles distant in a matter of approximately four and one-

half hours.

PHOTOGRAPHING THE RANSOM MONEY

It is believed experience has shown that automatic feed

Recordak equipment of a type having an odometer counter and which will

handle paper of the texture of used currency, is most satisfactory for

photographing the ransom currency. The counter provides a check of the

number of bills photographed in a given package and will provide an alert

if there is an inaccurate count.

It is considered absolutely necessary that, as soon as it is

determined, the preparation of a ransom and a ransom list may be or is

necessary, steps be taken through the nearest Recordak representative to

make one or more of these machines available for installation at a

suitable scene of operations, preferably away from either the Bureau Field

Office or any temporary Bureau headquarters set up on the case. A

suitable location may be found in the vault or other isolated section of the

- 3 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 94

---

## Page 95

bank through which the ransom money is being prepared. In this

connection and in the interest of security and secrecy, a Federal Reserve

Bank, if one is in the vicinity, may offer the best advantages from several

standpoints, namely:

1) If a large sum must be assembled of a certain kind of

currency, it would probably not be or hand at any one

private banking institution and may have to be obtained through the Federal

Reserve Bank.

2) Banking connections of prominent families are usually

known to many bank employees and may be known to

the press. These individuals may exhibit an interest in the ransom

money preparation which could possibly be detrimental to the investigation

and which could probably be avoided if a Federal Reserve Bank is used.

3) In all probability considerable night work will be

necessary for several dozen persons. They can be

assembled at a Federal Reserve Bank without arousing the curiosity of

outsiders more effectively than at a private bank, particularly where it is

known the family has its banking interests.

The mere obtaining and installation of the proper type of

recording equipment does not insure a successful photographic operation.

The mechanical adjustments on the machine, particularly the feeding

mechanism where used currency is the subject material, is very critical.

- 4 =

NW 55044-DocId:32989526 Page 95

---

## Page 96

The Recordak representative should effect these adjustments,

photograph a trial number of bills which should be processed immediately

to insure proper operation.

In this connection and in the actual operation of photographing

the ransom money, attention is invited to instructions set forth in the

Manual of Instructions concerning the obtaining of a clearance from the

United States Secret Service before photographing money.

The Recordak representative should also provide training

and instructions to the individuals who will operate the equipment on the

loading, changing and removal of film reels. These photographers or

operators should be banking employees working under the guidance of

Bureau agents.

Exposed film should be identified as follows:

1) Before photographing each package of one hundred bills,

a photo of a 3 x 5 card should be taken on which is

clearly shown the name of the bank employee, photographer, date and

identity of the case.

2) Each reel of film sent to the FBI Laboratory, whether

developed or me rely exposed, should be handled by Agents

as evidence. If the film is only exposed this should be plainly indicated

on the package containing this particular reel to avoid accidental

exposure because there may not be another opportunity to photograph

this portion of the money again.

-5 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 96

---

## Page 97

:

It is suggested that if facilities are at all available for

developing the Recordak film locally that exposed film be immediately

processed for the following reasons:

1) Will insure that photographing equipment if functioning

properly during the operation.

2) That operators are efficient.

3) Will provide immediate opportunity for scanning results

in a viewer for partially or completely superimposed

bills, which when photographed were in such position as

to obscure portions of or all of the identifying currency

serial numbers. Further, it will also indicate instances

where for some reason or other, the bill happened to

be photographed face down, thereby obscuring identifying

characteristics.

4) Where superimposition is discovered it permits

rephotography of that group of one hundred bills which

should be done rather than trying to photograph only

the bills involved.

Photographing of the face of the ransom currency should

begin at the earliest possible time and not delayed for the handlisting of

the bills. In fact, a bundle of one hundred bills can be photographed in

seconds, thus permitting the hand listing to begin virtually simultaneously.

- 6 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 97

---

## Page 98

:

It should be borne in mind that, in the event of an early,

unexpected or premature demand for the ransom payoff is made, that

the photographic record of the money would be better than none or even

better than a partial handwritten list.

If photography is the only record available and it is done

with the insertion on the film of proper identifying cards with each package

of one hundred bills such film could be used for identifying the ransom

money at a later time and conceivably as evidence in court.

HAND LISTING OF BILLS

In addition to the instructions set forth in the Manual the

following is offered:

A lined tablet sheet of approximately legal size and having

thirty-three or more lined spaces is suitable for preparing the handwritten

list of bills and is usually readily available in most banking institutions

or at local stationery stores.

The top margin of this sheet can be used for identifying

data and by drawing two vertical lines down through the lined spaces,

the sheet can be divided into three columns, each with thirty-three lined

spaces for recording bill serial numbers. This gives spaces for ninety-

nine bills of the one hundred bill package.

- 7 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 98

---

## Page 99

:

At the head or top of the third column the vertical line

dividing columns two and three should be extended upward a distance of a

lined space and then to the right to the edge of the page. This will be

the space on which the serial number of the sixty-seventh bill of the

package will be entered thereby keeping the bills listed in the order making

up the package.

The reason this is suggested is that it provides an

instantaneous visual check to insure that:

1) The particular package has ene hundred bills in it and:

2) That all one hundred have been handlisted. In a recent

case where currency was shipped from an auxiliary bank

and some thirty thousand bills prepared, some of the currency had a musty

odor and was somewhat damp to the touch. Apparently it had been stored

• in a damp place.

Some of this money was not usable because the Recordak machine

would not handle it properly in this condition.

In photographing that portion of the money which could be used

and apparently due to some dampness, two of the bills were superimposed

so perfectly that only the upper one was photographed and the bank employee

doing the photography did not check the odometer count or possibly did

not have it properly reset so that the fact that only ninety-nine bills were

photographed in that package came to his attention.

- 8 ÷

NW 55044 DacId:32989526 Page 99

---

## Page 100

When this package of bills was handlisted the bills were

apparently still together since the page on which the package was listed

contained only ninety-nine serial numbers. This was not immediately

noted and when the lists and films were sent to the Bureau for the

preparation of the ransom list it was discovered one bill was missing.

Since the ransom was not paid in this case, the money was

returned to the bank several months later and meanwhile apparently dried out.

The package having the handlisting of only ninety-nine bills

was examined and found to actually contain one hundred bills.

If the pages for the handwritten list had had one extra space

as above described or some other simple method of assuring a proper

count had been used it is believed this missing bill would have been

found and listed due to the simple visual check made possible by the

system outlined.

If a sheet is used having more than thirty-four lined spaces

it is suggested the same easy check can be effected by drawing a line

horizontally across the first and second columns thirty-three spaces down

and then a line across the third column thirty-four spaces down.

MISCELLANEOUS

If possible, the photographing and handlisting of the various

packages of currency should follow the same sequence to aid the data processing

section of the Bureau in locating errors or questionable entries.

This may not be one hundred per cent possible because instances

will occur when it will be necessary to re-run a package of bills through the

Recordak machine some time after they were originally photographed and after

other packages had been exposed.

For instance, when proof viewing, if this is possible, some

superimposed currency may be noted necessitating that particular package of bills

be photographed again. As of possible aid to the data processing section in

reconciling possible errors and discrepancies, the following is suggested:

The 3 x 5 card bearing the identifying data as to file number,

date, name of photographing bank employee, etc., will be photographed at the

beginning of each "bundle" of ten packages of currency and also photographed

again before each package of bills are photographed.

This card could have, say in the left lower corner, the Roman

numeral I followed by a small Arabic numeral 1 and photographed prior to the

running of the first package of one hundred bills. For the second package

of one hundred bills the Arabic figure 2 would be added after the Arabic numeral

1 and this same procedure followed on up through the tenth package of bills.

The card would then be placed on the face of package one which

would be the top package of a bundle of ten packages which would then be assigned

for handlisting.

- 10 -

-NW-55044_DocId:32989526 Page 101

---

## Page 102

The ten packages of this bundle could then be identified on the

particular sheet on which these particular bills are handlisted by merely

entering the package number on the sheet.

For the second bundle of ten packages the Roman numeral

Il would be used and the Arabic system 1 through 10 repeated.

This system could also be repeated for each denomination of

bills processed.

Care should be taken that the 3 x 5 cards are not included with

the ransom money when it is finally assembled. Cards should be removed

at the time the handlisting operation occurs and not replaced on the bundles.

A simple control system should be set up to insure that all cards are

retrieved before the ransom money is packaged.

In a recent case where time was limited and in order to be

certain the photography was beng properly handled, exposed film was processed

immediately after exposure by the local Recordak agency. Since there was

the possibility all handwritten lists would not be completed before a pay-off

demand came, in which case it was conceivable the film might be the only

evidentiary record of the money, the film was escorted through the

Recordak processing laboratory by the bank employee who did the

photography and who could appear as a competent witness if need be.

It is suggested that after the photography and preparation of

the handwritten list has been in progress for say, three hours, a check be

made to determine the amount of work accomplished which would then

- 11-

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 102

---

## Page 103

give an estimate of approximately when completion of the ransom money

processing could be expected. This check could be made repeatedly

throughout the operation insofar as is considered necessary and would

serve as a barometer by which it could be told whether or not more

employees and machines are needed. It also will provide information

which can be furnished the Bureau as to about when it could expect to

receive the films and handwritten lists.

TECHNICAL INSTALLATIONS

IN VICTIN'S HOME

The victim's residence was served by a private telephone

line which traveled underground from the road to the residence,

entering the residence in a crawl space located underneath the

bedroom areas of the house. There were four extension telephones,

one in victim's wife's bedroom, one in the bedroom occupied by

victim's two daughters, one in the kitchen and one in the basement

recreation room.

Prior to the Bureau's officially entering the investigation

on February 10, 1960, two deputies from the Jefferson County Sheriff's

Office had been assigned to the victim's residence by the Jefferson

County Sheriff. These deputies had connected a recorder to the

telephone extension located in the basement recreation room by

taping the microphone of the recorder to the ear piece of the

telephone handset.

Arrangements had been made with the person

designated to answer the telephone to pick up the handset of the

upstairs extension at the end of the third ring, at which time one

of the deputies would turn the recorder on and lift the receiver

of the recreation room extension telephone.

The sound-trained Agent went to victim's residence on the

evening of February 10, 1960. A 1948 Ford panel truck was used to

take this Agent and the equipment to victim's residence..

The

following was the equipment taken:

2.

Western Electric 500 C/D telephone instrument with

Audio Development Co. transformer #114A.

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 104

## Page 105

Two Magnecord PT 6 amplifiers and four Transport units.

3.

Two Magnecord transfer switches.

1.

One Magnecord voice-operated relay.

5. FM radio dispatcher únit.

6. Lineman's test set.

7. Supply of magnetic recording tape.

8. 100 foot spool of two-conductor wire.

9. Foot box with flashlight, tools, tape and miscellaneous

10. Mile Ray light.

• Due to the layout of victim's residence and due to the

fact that victim's wife and four children had friends coming to the

residence to visit them, the kidnap telephone installation was made

in the basement recreation room in place of the extension telephone

located there. This area of the house was the only place Agents

could remain out of sight of visitors visiting members of victim's

family. Making the installation in this room made it necessary for

the person designated to answer the telephone, one of the victim's

brothers of the brother of victim's wife, to come down to the

basement recreation room to answer the telephone when it rang. The

other three extension telephones were disconnected in the terminal

block located in the crawl space under the house. This was done to

prevent anyone from picking up the handset of one of the telephone

extensions located on the main floor of the house while a telephone

call was being received on the kidnap telephone installation, thus

causing a disturbance on the line.

- 2 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 105

## Page 106

Following discussion with victim's wife regarding the plans

for the family during the time the victim was missing, victim's wife

made arrangements for the children to live elsewhere and she

discouraged most of her friends from making visits to her residence.

• This provided more security for the Agents and the recording equipment

at victim's residence. The kidnap telephone instrument was then

moved to victim's wife's bedroom where one Agent remained on duty

at all times, along with the person designated to answer the telephone

The victim's wife's bedroom, in which the kidnap telephone

installation was made, was located about 90 feet away from the

recreation area at the far end of the house. It was connected to

the Magnecord recording equipment in the recreation room and this

was accomplished by running a two-conductor wire from the "Bridge In"

of the Magnecord amplifier in the recreation room through the furnace

room and through the crawl space under the house to victim's wife's

bedroom. The wire was routed into the room through the hole in the

floor used by the Telephone Company in the original installation of

the telephone extension located in this room and was connected to

the transformer attached to the Western Electric 500 telephone

instrument. A connection was made from the ground terminal of the

transformer to a nearby electrical outlet box. A lineman's test

set was connected to the red and green terminals of the telephone

connecting block along with the kidnap telephone instrument. The

switch on the lineman's test set was taped to prevent it from

being switched from the monitor position which would have permitted

the feeding of extraneous noises on the line. This test set was used

-3 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 106

---

## Page 107

by the Agent on duty in this room to listen in on the calls while

they were being received and permitted him to give the proper

prearranged signals to the person receiving the call.

A Magnecord amplifier and two Transport units with a trans-

fer switch and a voice-operated relay were used in this recording

of the telephone calls. Another Magnecord amplifier and two Transport

units were set up next to the ones being used for the recording and

a connection made from the "Bridge In" of the Magnecord amplifier in

use to the "Bridge In" of the Magnecord amplifier maintained as a

stand-by. In the event a failure had occurred in the Magnecord

amplifier while a call was being recorded, the recording operation

could have been continued by switching the motor-control switch

of the Magnecord Transport unit set up as a stand-by to the

"forward position."

A direct, private, unlisted and nonpublished line had been

installed which permitted Agents at victim's residence to communicate

directly with Headquarters Office. The instrument at victim's

residence was located in the basement recreation room and the

instrument at Headquarters Office was located on the desk of the

Special Agent in Charge of the Special. When the handset of either

of these instruments was removed from the cradle, the other

instrument would ring. This arrangement permitted rapid, direct

communication between victim's residence and the Headquarters Office.

The instrument at victim's residence was located near the recording.

equipment.and the SAC of the Special could listen in on a telephone

## Page 108

call at victim's residence while it was being recorded by holding

the handset of the telephone instrument, connected to the direct

line, near the speaker of the Magnecord amplifier.

When a telephone call was received at victim's residence

the SAC of the Special or the person designated to remain in charge

in his absence was notified by use of the direct line to have the

Telephone Company continue the tracing of the call or to discontinue

the tracing operation, depending upon the identity of the caller.

Locating the recording equipment in the basement recreation

room away from the main living area provided security for the

recording operation and for the Agent operating the equipment when

visitors came to victim's residence. At the same time, the Agent

operating the equipment could provide security for the ransom

package containing the $500,000 which had been placed in a basement

storeroom near the recreation room.

An FM radio dispatcher unit was set up in the basement

recreation room for the purpose of communicating with Headquarters

Office or with Bureau automobiles, should the occasion arise. This

unit was also utilized to test the concealed radio units in the

automobile that was to be used by a person handling the ransom

package. Radio installations had been made in this car and this

car was stored in victim's residence garage and the radio equipment

was tested every 24 hours by the sound-trained Agent on duty at

victim's residence.

LABORATORY EXPERT ON THE MAJOR CASE SQUAD

The Laboratory expert's primary function on a Major

Case squad is that of technical advisor and consultant to the

Inspector in Charge of the squad and the #i Man on the ore side,

and the investigating agents on the other. It is his duty to

assist in resolving any problems relating to physical evidence

collected during the course of the

investigation. The basic

responsibilities of a Laboratory experton a Major Case squad

are as follows:

Io Be available to answer any questions arising with

regard to proper handling of physical evidence.

2. Supervise packing and shipment of physical

evidence to the Laboratory for examination.

3. Conduct preliminary examination of physical

evidence with the purpose of eliminating useless

requests of the laboratory and furnish the

investigating agents with the results of

preliminary examinations for investigative

guidance.

4. Dictate inserts on laboratory matters.

5. Dictate leads arising as a result of collection

and/or examination of physical evidence.

6. Periodically, review the subsection of the case

sile entitled "Laboratory Matters" in order to

be certain that all leads which may have arisen

from Laboratory examinations have been dictated

_NW 55044DocId: 32989526 Page 109

---

## Page 110

and are being covered by the investigating

agents. In this connection, it is also the

responsibility of the Laboratory expert to see

that the subsection of the case file entitled

"Laboratory Matters" is up to date and current

at all times.

" Organizing and supervising projects arising as

the result of location of physical evidence. For

example, furnishing technical instruction to an

investigating. agent to assist him in obtaining

handwriting and typewriting specimens and in

eliminating typewriters obviously different from

that used in preparing a questioned ransom letter

in a kidnaping case.

of the Major Case squad regarding all Laboratory

matters in order that they may have the benefit

For example, the Laboratory expert may,

through his technical knowledge and experience,

be in a position to suggest a certain line of

inquiry which may not be readily apparent to the

Inspector in Charge or #l Man.

10. Provide all necessary technical assistance in

connection with crime scene searches such as

co-ordinating the collection, preseruation and

identification of all physical evidence.

It is

also his responsibility to see that the necessary

graphs, charts and photographs are prepared at

the crime scene.

work in close

cooperation with the official

photographer on the Major case squad to see that

reproduction facilities, such as cameras,

Auto-stating equipment, Photostating equipment

and dark room are available and are in readiness for

any photographic or copying work which may be

necessary.

12. In connection with kidnaping cases, to handle

all extortion and crank letters which may be

directed to the victim and see that they are

properly identified, photocopied and forwarded

to the Laboratory for examination.

23.

Perform any other duties which are requested by

Inspector in Charge and til Man in so far as

primary responsibilities permit. The Inspector

in Charge of the Major Case squad should attempt

to avoid nontechnical assignments to the

Laboratory man which will make him unavailable

to properly perform his duties pertaining to the

Laboratory aspects of the case.

As can be seen from the list of responsibilities of the

Laboratory expert set forth above, any Laboratory man assigned to

a Major Case squad should be well-rounded in all phases of the

Laboratory's work in order that he can properly handle his

responsibilities.

When a Laboratory man is assigned to a Major

Case squad and prior to his departure from the laboratory in

Washington, he should confer with the various section and unit

chiefs of the Laboratory at the Bureau regarding any technical

activity which he may encounter in the field. He should also

carefully check the list of equipment and supplies which will be

necessary for him to take with him on his assignment to the field.

No set list of materials can be arbitrarily drawn up; such a list

depends entirely on the case in question, the availability of

facilities in the field, and the availability of technical

equipment in the field.

Upon arrival in the field on a Major Case squad, the

Laboratory expert should, if possible, arrange for suitable

working space, so arranged that his technical equipment is readily

available and working conditions are such that a minimum of

distraction is present.

The above observations are set forth for the guidance not

only of the laboratory expert assigned to a Major Ease squad but

also for the guidance of the Inspector in Charge of the lajor Case

squad and the #l Man.

EQUIPMENT

At the inception of COORNAP, an inventory was made of

all supplies available in the Denver Office. Efforts were made to

immediately correct obvious omissions. The following Items were

received from other offices or the Bureau:

Shoulder pack transmitters and receivers

MX Unit - transmitter and receiver

Decoy package

Concealed automobile transmitter

Of particular importance among the items assigned to the

Denver Office were the Handie Talkies, the twenty-five watt

transmitter and receiver and Motorola pocket receivers and

transmitters.

In addition to the above, the Bureau forwarded the

infrared viewer, together with infrared lenses for mile ray lamp

and floodlight.

Additionally, the small items which it was felt might

be necessary in the event of a pay off or concurrent investigation

vere assembled in one suitcase, as follows:

Flashlight

Large rolls of two types of twine

Paper clips

Rubber bands

Pencils

Fingerprint dusting kit with spare

Scotch tape

Two pair of rubber gloves

Tweezers

Rulers

Spray lacquer

Cellophane envelopes

Plain envelöpes

Portable fingerprint kit

Writing tablets

Evidence tags

Spare batteries

Compasses

Magnifying glass

Plaster of Paris

Because of the mountainous and unoccupied area in which

the kidnaping occurred and in which it was felt that if the

victim were murdered a body might be buried, shovels, an ax

and a pick were also obtained. A heavy hammer and stakes were

obtained in anticipation of the necessity of roping off an

area for a crime-scene search.

## Page 115

:

All of the equipment which it was anticipated might

be used in the investigation was maintained separately from the

regular office equipment so that it could be immediately issued

without searching through cabinets or other receptacles before

issuing. Each item of equipment was charged to the Agent to

whom issued by the equipment supervisor or a designated alternate.

A separate charge-out book was maintained.

As kidnaping in COORNAP occurred in February, at the

beginning of extremely inclement weather, it was felt that

clothing for outdoor surveillance of pay off should be obtained.

Contact was made with one of the sporting goods stores and the

following items were obtained on a loan basis:

Three parkas

Three pair of men's down underpants

Three hand warmers

One can of fluid for hand warmers

One pair of khaki pants

Contact was also made with one of the large department

stores and the following items which were not available at the

sporting goods store, were obtained:

Three pair of insulated boots

Three pair of quilted, insulated underwear

Six pair of wool and cotton socks

Three pair of knit wool gloves

-3 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 115.1

---

## Page 116

:

Two pair of heavy work pants

Three hoods for face covering

The hand warmers were felt necessary because it was

felt that Agents' hands should be warm and facile in the event

of an emergency.

In addition, the department store made available the

top half of a male mannequin as it was felt that the male mannequin

could be dressed in clothing and possibly placed on the front

or back seat of an automobile in the event of a pay off or other

activity at night.

All of these items were obtained on a loan basis, and

at the time it was determined that no pay off would be made the

articles of clothing were returned without charge to these stores.

Arrangements were made with the managers of these

two stores, and with the managers of hardware, radio and electrical

stores, to permit twenty-four hour contact in the event an

emergency arose.

It was found that the operators of these stores

were cognizant of the Coors' investigation but were not told in any

instance that the FBI was actually working on this case. They

neither asked for nor were given an explanation for the requests.

The individuals operating these stores were all known to the

Agents of the Denver FBI as reliable persons, and no record of

their names was found in the indices. Even though it was

probably assumed by them that this request was made as the result

- 4 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 116

---

## Page 117

of the disappearance of Adolph Coors, III, no mention was made

of this case in contacting them as publicity had appeared to the

effect that the family of the victim had requested all law

enforcement agencies to cease investigation.

As Agents were on twenty-four hour duty at the office

for a considerable period of time and thereafter worked extra-

ordinarily long hours, it was considered necessary to have food

and coffee available at the office. A coffee percolator was

obtained on a loan basis from one of the coffee suppliers.

Arrangements were made for the delivery of lood to the office by

a restaurant as the building in which the Denver IBI Offico is

located is locked after regular office hours; and, additionally,

local newspapers had reporters posted at the building on a

twenty-four hour basis. As a consequence, it was necessary for

Agents, particularly those coming in on special, to come to and

leave the office space by a circuitous route in an elfort to avoid

being seen by these reporters. These Agents were able to obtain

food and return with it to the office. In larger towns the problem

of obtaining food on a twenty-four hour basis is not acute. In a

smaller town where twenty-four hour restaurant service is not

available, it would probably be locessary to lay in a larger

stock of food for night consumption or make arrangements with a

restaurant owner to have food available on a twenty-four hour

basis.

The problem of darkroom facilities did not arise in

the Denver Office during the actual investigation of COORNAP

while the special was on, but subsequently when it was necessary

to prepare a summary report containing numerous blown up

photographs, it was determined that the darkroom facilities of the

Denver Office were inadequate. Because this work can be done

at night or on weekends, a request was made of the Denver Police

Department for the use of their darkroom. This darkroom was made

available and adequately handled the large number of photographs

which had to be prepared. The possibility of utilizing police

darkrooms should be considered, particularly if headquarters are

being set up for an office other than the FBI headquarters city.

Agents designated by the Bureau to come to Denver on

special in COORNAP from the Salt Lake City, Albuquerque and Butte

Offices, brought with them live automobiles which operated on the

same radio frequency as the Denver Office. It was necessary in

• order that these automobiles not be conspicuous that Colorado

license plates be obtained. In addition to obtaining these

license plates, it was necessary to obtain current brake and light

stickers which are placed on windshields of automobiles in

Colorado. These items were necessary, of course, to conform with

Colorado law and so that the cars would not be conspicuous. This

should be remembered in the event of specials in cities such as

Kansas City where tax stickers are placed in the windshield of

automobiles.

## Page 119

It was felt necessary to designate one of the

automobiles of the Coors family as the automobile which would

probably be used for a pay off. The automobile which it was

thought could be most easily duplicated was so designated. This

was a 1958 Impala owned by Bill Coors, brother to the victim.

Contact was made with numerous car dealers in the Denver area

but none had in his possession an automobile identical to the

car owned by Bill Coors. A Police Captain in a suburban town,

who was known to be a used-car salesman on the side, was contacted

and he located an automobile similar in appearance. It was

necessary to have this car partially repainted to achieve a two-

tone eîfect and to place a radio aerial on the right front fender.

Additionally, it was necessary to remove one dealer's metal

identification plate from this car and replace it with a plate

identical to that appearing on Bill Coors' car.

As the possibility existed that the pay off would

necessitate a loose surveillance, would occur in the mountainous

farm or cattle-raising area of Colorado or in metropolitan Denver,

different arrangements had to be made. A taxicab was rented and

a taxicab driver's hat was obtained. Arrangements were made for

immediate delivery from one of the truck rental firms of a cattle

truck or farm truck in the event one was necessary. The tazicab

and the Chevrolet Impala, rented to duplicate Bill Coors' car,

were both stored at a garage near the office where they could be

obtained on a moment's notice.

-? =

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 119

## Page 120

Arrangements were also made that if necessary a truck

of one of the local public utilities would be available for use

in the event a stationary surveillance in the city area was

necessary.

The automobile of Bill Coors was equipped with the

concealed automobile transmitter (CAT). This unit was located

under the front seat beneath the seat springs. It was activated

by means of the speaker switch of the regular car radio at the

lower center of the dash. The microphone was concealed under

the speaker grill at the center of the dash. The broadcast

receiver of the regular car radio was disabled by removal of

a fuse. The antenna of the CAT unit was connected to the exhaust

pipe at the left rear of the car and additional antenna was spread

under the car body.

In both Bill Coors' car and in the car which simulated

it, Fandie Talkies were also placed under the front seat and

connected by coaxial cable to the regular automobile antenna.

This antenna was then regulated to the proper length to handle

the Handie Tallie. The speaker of the Handie Talkie was concealed

under the seat but was immediately available, and the switch

controlling this Handie Talkie was placed in such a position that

it could be easily reached by the driver.

:

It was felt necessary to have a car simulating Bill

coors' car as it was not known if he and his automobile would

be immediately available on a twenty-four hour basis. The

simulated car, of course, was always kept available.

As it was not known if Adolph Coors, III, would be

returned alive or would bekilled by his kidnaper, the identities

of competent physicians were determined in Denver and the

surrounding counties. These individuals can usually be determined

either through personal contact of the Agents in the office or

through contact with the various local law enforcement agencies.

The same is true of autopsy surgeons who are usually known to

local law

enforcement officers or coroners. It should also be

borne in mind that it possibly may be necessary to obtain the

identities of coroners in areas considered pertinent to the

investigation. In the COORNAP case these men were contacted

early in the investigation and their cooperation solicited. It

was found that each was cooperative and indicated that he would

not notify the papers or other publicity media, realizing the

necessity of a thorough crime-scene search before the public

invaded the area.

Tinetables of the various public transportation

facilities were obtained, but arrangements were also made with

ranking officials at various airlines in Denver to bump

passengers in the event that was necessary in the handling of

COORNAP.

Joseph Corbett had told friends that he hunted in the

Golden Gate Canyon area northwest of Golden, Colorado. Inasmuch

as a yellow Mercury was earlier reported as

pertinent in this

investigation and prior to its discovery burned on a dump in

New Jersey, investigation was conducted in Colorado in an effort

to locate this car. As the car was reported a bright yellow in

color, use was made of a slow flying airplane to search the

Golden Gate area, and also the area contiguous to victim's home

and the bridge from which he disappeared. Consideration was given

to use of a helicopter. This type of machine was not used, however,

because of danger in the high rugged mountain area where up drafts

and down drafts might have easily wrecked the plane. The aircraft

was obtained through the services of a Colonel with the U. S. Air

Force who was also the liaison man with the Civil Air Patrol..

As it was felt that Corbett might demand payment of

ransom in the mountainous area with which he was reported familiar,

contact was made with stables for the rental of horses. In

addition, it was felt that guides might be necessary and contact

was made with State Game Wardens, U. S. Forestry Service Rangers

and particularly with some of the old-time prospectors and wood

cutters in the mountainous area. These men were constantly

available for assistance.

In COORNAP demand was made for $500,000 ransom. The

only communication received did not specify the type of container

the money should be placed in. A footlocker, measuring 31" by

- 10 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 122

---

## Page 123

16 3/4" by 122", was found to hold the demanded ransom in mixed

bills. A footlocker of this sort, not metal, was obtained from

a local manufacturer. A hole was cut in the center of the bottom

of the tootlocker so that the switch of the ransom decoy package

would fit within this hole. The switch was built up so that it

would protrude beyond the side of the footlocker. A cloth

similar to the cover used on the footlocker was obtained from

the manufacturer and substituted for the cloth torn when the

hole was cut in the bottom of the footlocker. This cloth was

placed on the footlocker loosely so that it would not activate

the switch. The footlocker was then packed with seventy pounds

of newspaper which was the approximate weight of the bills. The

ransom decoy package was placed in the iootlocker so that it would

be in an off position when the tootlocker was resting on its

bottom. In order to obtain additional transmitting range, a 100p

antenna was placed around the inside of the trunk lid. This was

made of two turns of Belden indoor aerial wire; a condenser was

connected in series with the loop to tune it. This condenser was

mounted at the center of the back edge of the lid of the footlocker

in place of a rivet which was removed. The condenser could then

be tuned by a small screwdriver from either the outside or inside

of the trunk. The loop antenna vas connected by a low impedance

line to a coupling loop 2" in diameter and consisting of two turns.

Lining paper matching the interior of the trunk was obtained from

the manufacturer and used to cover the antenna and connecting wires.

As twenty-five Agents were sent to the Denver Office

on special, it was necessary to obtain maps for these Agents

in order to facilitate their becoming acquainted with the area.

This required obtaining regular State maps which are obtainable

through service stations, and also maps of the City of Denver

and surrounding suburbs. Before the discovery of the skeleton

remains of Adolph Coors, III, a detailed search was made of the

mountainous area where the Laboratory stated samples of soil

found under the car destroyed by Corbett, originated. A contact

was made with the Geological Survey for quadrangle maps of the

entire mountain area, and the maps were obtained and supplied

to the Agents naking this search. These maps were coordinated

with county maps obtainable through the State Highway Department.

A team of jour Agents was assigned to each quadrangle map area

which covered approximately seventy miles. These Agents were

instructed to travel every road in the quadrangle and talk to all

residents, and to search all mines, buildings, caves or other

places where a body might be concealed.

Nine stenographers and clerks were sent to the Denver

Office on this special. It was necessary to obtain office

equipment for these employees. This equipment was obtained

primarily from the General Services Administration on a loan

or rental basis.

At the time the skeleton remains of Adolph Coors, III,

were found it was necessary that a detailed crime-scene search

be conducted. This search covered a large area in rugged

mountainous terrain. A regular crime search line was established

with one man acting as anchor on each end of the line. In

order to keep both Agents anchoring the line in contact with

the office, the men anchoring the line each carried a Motorola

pocket receiver and transmitter. With these items they were

able to maintain contact with a two-way automobile stationed

In the vicinity, which in turn was able to contact the office

approximately thirty miles away.

The equipment man should maintain close contact with

all personnel on the special, particularly the Special Agent in

Charge. All requests for any equipment should be channeled

through the equipment supervisor as he may have the equipment

available in the office or have made arrangements for it to be

available at some supplier. It is suggested that the equipment

supervisor be an Agent assigned to the local office because of

contacts already available.

LIAISON AT VICTIM'S HOME IN KIDNAPING CASES

PREFACE

The comments contained herein are based on one

actual experience of being in a kidnaped victim's residence.

Accordingly, it is to be recognized there are many different

circumstances, conditions, problems and types of people that will

differ in each individual case. It is to be noted that the material in

the manual on this topic covers most any situation. The following

is offered as Agents' experiences of having been in the COORS'

residence for some seventeen days beginning February 11, 1960,

three days after ADOLPH COORS, Ill was kidnaped.

On February 9, 1960, the following note was received

by MARY COORS, the wife of victim:

"Mrs. Coors:

"Your husband has been kidnaped. His car is by Turkey Creek.

"Call the police or F. B. I.: he dies.

"Cooperate: he lives.

"Ransom: $200,000 in tens and $300, 000 in twenties.

"There will be no negotiating.

"Bills: used / non-consecutive / unrecorded / unmarked.

"Warning: we will know if you call the police or record the

serial numbers.

"Directions: Place money & this letter & envelope in

one suitcase or bag.

"Have two men with a car ready to make the delivery.

"When all set, advertise a tractor for sale in Denver

"Deliver immediately after receiving call.

Any delay will be regarded as a stall to set up

a stake-out.

"Understand this: Adolph's life is in your hands. We have no desire

to commit murder. All we want is that money. If you follow the

instructions, he will be released unharmed within 48 hours after the

money is received."

The ad was placed in an issue of the Denver Post which

was first available to the public on the night of February 13, 1960.

PREPARING TO GO INTO VICTIM'S HOME

In preparation for going into the victim's home, it is

essential that all information available relative to the entire case, as

known as of that time, be obtained as well as background of family and

conditions in the residence.

Some consideration should be given to wearing apparel.

The following are a few of the items which were found to be useful:

Washable, quick dry underwear

Quick dry shirts

Respectable pair of lounging shoes with soles that will not

make excessive noise when walking around the house

Adequate sleeping garments

Personal toilet items.

The following equipment was used and found to

be desirable:

Stationery and writing supplies

Typewriter

Dictaphone

Camera

Sidearms and shotgun

Complete kit for taking fingerprints

Technical equipment necessary to handle the specific

situation should be selected by Agent making

the installation.

It was found that two recordings of each telephone

conversation was essential, indicating additional recording units

would be necessary.

Sufficient attachments for the private phone line to

the Field Office enabling each Agent in the residence to

simultaneously enter into conferences with the Person in Charge

of the case.

Monitoring instrument to be attached directly to

the phone on which incoming calls are to be received at the residence.

Arrangements should be made to discreetly enter

the home of the victim.

PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AT VICTIM'S HOME

On arrival at the COORS' residence, on February 11,

1960, local law enforcement officers had departed and a log was

established which would continue to reflect activities there during

the stay of the Agents. First contact at the residence was made with

JAMES GRANT, a lawyer and the brother of MARY COORS, victim's

wife. He advised that a number of family friends were visiting

and that the four COORS' children and some of their friends were

in the house. Other friends were expected to arrive. During the

initial conversation with GRANT, it was noted that numerous phone

calls were being received from family friends. MARY COORS

joined the latter part of the conversation with GRANT and it was

explained to them that it was necessary now to have more privacy

in the residence. It was agreed the guests would be excused.

Shortly thereafter, the guests left. The Agents

were shown through the residence for the purpose of familiarizing

them with it. For a detailed description of the house, blueprints

were obtained and are probably still available in the Denver Office.

Briefly the house may be described as located in a rather remote

mountain side location, outside of a suburban community of Denver,

known as Morrison, Colorado. The residence is not in direct view

of any other habitation, but is situated in the foothills in such a

manner that it could be watched from numerous locations in higher

surrounding terrain. The house itself is large with four bedrooms

on the main floor. Three of the bedrooms in line. Adjacent to the

main entrance there is a stairwell down to a daylight basement of

considerable proportions. The bedroom on the extreme end of the

line of bedrooms is a large room with private bath and dressing room.

It was normally occupied by Mr. and Mrs. COORS. The two bedrooms

in line, separated by a bath and adjoining the master bedroom, were

occupied by the two COORS' girls and the other one by the two COORS'

boys. The fourth bedroom on the first level was separated from

these and

normally unoccupied. The remaining space upstairs

composed of a large living room, dining room, kitchen and utility

room. The basement, occupying less space than the first floor,

consisted of a furnace room, large recreation room that was

furnished with complete kitchen facilities in one corner and normal

recreation room furniture. The basement also had a combination

bedroom - office and a bathroom. Adjoining the bedroom - office, is

a room completely enclosed in cement with the exception of one

door from the office, and originally designed as a bomb shelter.

It contained a deep freeze and a few personal items in storage.

The garage is located to the side of and directly

attached to the house near the front entrance. It is accessible from

a door between the end of the garage and the inside of the house.

The doors are electrically controlled. These controls are on the

inside of the garage located directly adjacent to the door entering

the house. The garage contained space for three automobiles and

storage area.

The normal phone service used by the COORS' family

consisted of a private line with extensions in the bedroom used by

Mr. and Mrs. COORS, one in the kitchen and the third extension in

the recreation area downstairs.

During the tour through the house, MARY and JIM

brought up the question as what should be done about the friends

of MARY COORS expected to arrive within the next few minutes,

most of those coming were bringing food and et cetera. It was

suggested that if they could be reached by telephone, they be

requested not to appear. This MARY COORS did.

The four children, ranging in ages of 10 to 18,

presented a problem in the residence, in that they were making and

- 8 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 133

---

## Page 134

receiving numerous phone calls, and using the entire residence without

being able to understand any imposed restrictions. For security

reasons and the general peace of mind of all, it was decided by MARY

COORS and JIM GRANT that if the children's grandparents,

Mr. and Mrs. COORS, SR., were willing, the four children should

stay at their residence. This was arranged and the COORS' children

remained at the grandparents' residence until the Agents departed

the victim's home.

In regard to the numerous phone calls that were

being received by MARY COORS, it became obvious that something

would have to be done to avoid possible interference with the

kidnaper's call. Also each time the phone rang, it completely

interrupted the entire household until the identity of the caller was

known. In this connection, MARY COORS telephonically contacted

two or three of her friends instructing them to call other people who

would be most likely to contact her telephonically, requesting them

to refrain until further notice. In addition, she asked JOE and BILL

COORS, brothers-in-law, to contact their immediate family with

the same request.

The servant arrangement consisted of two maids,

one appearing primarily as a house cleaner, and the other as a

laundry servant. Neither lived in and the arrival of both entailed

- 9 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 134

---

## Page 135

an automobile trip to the bus stop by MARY COORS. It was decided

that one full-time maid living in would be more adaptable to the

situation for purposes of security and convenience. MARY COORS

selected the maid to be kept, that selection being based on long time

acquaintanceship and her ability as a servant and cook.

This reduction of the household members and visitors

left MARY COORS, JIM GRANT and THELMA HOFFMAN, the maid.

In addition, on a schedule of 24 hours each, JOE and BILL COORS

were to alternate being in the residence.

The first evening it was noted that MARY COORS

was becoming increasingly nervous, sometimes almost hysterical.

The following day, with JIM GRANT'S assistance, MARY COORS

invited a friend as a permanent house guest.

All of the above arrangements, with the exception of

having MARY COORS invite her friend in to stay, were undertaken

and accomplished on the first afternoon the Agents arrived. During

this same period of time, a considerable number of requests were

made of MARY COORS for specific bits of information or things she

was to do. Some would be forgotten by her. It was the Agents'

experience in the residence with all members of the family, that it

was more desirable to make one specific request or resolve one

problem at a time rather than a number of them.

## Page 136

The schedule of service people who should call at

the residence was established so that there would be no Agent personnel

in sight when they arrived. MARY COORS' doctor was identified and

places where he would be available at all times established. This was

for the primary purpose of being able to locate him should she require

his attention.

Living quarters for the three Agents was established

in the daylight basement. Inasmuch as two Agents were scheduled

to be awake at all times, the one bed in the office with adjoining bath

was sufficient. One end of the recreation room, out of sight of the

stairwell and windows, was used for installation of private line and

recording equipment.

It was felt it was necessary to reduce the number of

telephone extensions to avoid any individual answering the phone

except the one selected to receive the kidnaper's call. Due to the

physical layout of the house, the extension in the recreation room

was left in service as it was available only to the Agents. As the

person answering the phone, should the kidnaper call, would be one

of the family, the extension in the master bedroom was designated

for this purpose. With MARY COORS' consent, this room was

converted into an office for the purpose of receiving phone calls and

most generally was occupied by one Agent and the member of the family

- 11 -

## Page 137

who was expecting to receive the call at the time. This separation

turned out satisfactorily in that it left the recreation room private

for the Agents' use with the technical equipment, dictating, use of the

private line and other general official activities, eliminating the

necessity of anyone but Agents to be there. The phone extension in

the kitchen was disconnected. The other three bedrooms upstairs

were used by MARY COORS and her friend, JIM GRANT and the

COORS brother in the residence, and the maid.

PLANS TO RECEIVE KIDNAPER'S CALL

MARY COORS was anxious to receive the phone call

but it was felt by the Agents present that she would be the least

capable of carrying on a conversation with the kidnaper.

JIM GRANT, age 42, Harvard Law graduate and

practicing attorney in New York, left the impression with the Agents

that he was the most desirable individual to receive an incoming call

from the kidnaper.

JOE COORS and BILL COORS, who alternated at the

residence, were to relieve JIM GRANT during the time he was to

sleep. GRANT was actually around and available to answer the

phone from 10:00 A.M. until 2:00 A.M. During the rest of the 24-

hour cycle, either JOE or BILL COORS was present for this purpose.

In giving instructions to the persons that were to answer the phone,

it was not necessary to include questions that would determine

whether or not the victim was alive, inasmuch as the family had

agreed that they wanted to pay the ransom money irrespective of

whether they had proof that he was alive. It was desirable to retain

the caller on the phone as long as possible to afford the possibility

of tracing the phone call.

Several questions were formulated, the answers of which

would determine if it was the kidnaper calling, were typed and left by the

- 13 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 138

---

## Page 139

phone that was to be used for incoming calls. In addition, on the

same desk attached to the phone was a monitoring instrument giving

an Agent across the desk a chance to hear both sides of any telephone

conversation coming into the residence. This was in addition to

monitoring and recording equipment in the recreation room. This

instrument was designed so the Agent could only listen and was

unable, to talk in it or have any other room noises interfere. To

facilitate the Agent having control over this conversation without

unduly interrupting a member of the family receiving the call, a

prompting board was improvised. On this board, which was a door

from the basement, was large printed phrases, as prompters, to

help the person taking the call to prolong the conversation and to

obtain pertinent information from the kidnaper. Some of these

phrases were:

SLOW DOWN

READY TO PAY

WILLING TO PAY

REPEAT THAT

PERSONAL ITEMS

ROADS ARE BAD - SNOW

HOW DO I KNOW YOU ARE THE KIDNAPER

- 14 -

-NW_55044 DocId:32989526 Page 139

---

## Page 140

.

JIM GRANT had a tendency to static-repeat phrases

made to the person he was talking to. He was encouraged and so were

JOE and BILL COORS on all conversations to static-repeat the phone

conversation.

There was never any intention that all these phrases

should be used in any one conversation. A baton type pointer was

available for the Agent to point to particular phrases which would be

applicable at that point in the conversation. Also on the desk to

facilitate the person carrying on the conversation was a copy of the

ransom note, typed questions, and a memo scratch pad and a crayon

was available to write reminders to the individual accepting the call.

Mock practices were conducted with all three individuals

who were expected to possibly take the call. In addition, prior to

the series of family calls being eliminated, the element of

repeating, slow down and other phrases on the board were used without

interfering with personal calls coming in.

INTERVIEWS OF MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY

Members of the family in the residence were repeatedly

and almost constantly interviewed in a conversational manner. These

interviews covered all subject matters pertinent to the case. The

close association for many hours within each 24-hour period made

it possible to handle interviews and problems in strictly a

conversational manner. This arrangement seemed ideal in that it

was possible to stay abreast of the family's thinking. At the same time,

it was imperative that each Agent in the residence be consistent with

each other and advise the Person in Charge in order that all problems

could be handled in an acceptable manner without contradiction.

It was felt necessary to note the answer to questions

propounded to members of the family by each Agent to avoid repeating

the same question to the same member of the family unnecessarily.

In eliminating personal items the victim could have had

on his person at the time of his abduction, a complete inventory was

made of his personal effects in the residence including clothing, as

well as those personal items in his office.

Hair specimens were obtained from victim's personal

brush and comb.

With MARY COORS' permission, all records and

papers in the residence were reviewed.

- 16 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 141

## Page 142

Members of the family were photographed and

fingerprinted.

The following items and information were obtained and

developed in the course of interviews of members of the family:

Photo of victim

Wearing apparel at time of abduction

Hair specimens of victim

Personal items in possession at time of abduction

Identity of retailer that could identify personal items in

his possession at time of abduction

Identity of doctors and hospitals relative to medical

history of victim

HANDLING OF RANSOM MONEY AT RESIDENCE

On the evening of February 12, the prepared ransom

money in the amount of $500, 000 was delivered to the residence by

bank officials. It arrived in a sealed canvas bag and was accepted at the

residence by BILL COORS. It was placed in the bomb shelter room

previously described. This room had been selected because it was not

accessible from the outside of the house and the one inside door could

be locked. In this room was placed two footlockers, one of which was

to be used to deliver the money in. These two lockers had been marked

for future identification prior to arrival in the residence. One of them

contained a radio sounding device, the other had no equipment. Also in

this room was placed the original ransom note and an exact facsimile.

The money was left in the sealed canvas bag. Depending on the circum-

stances and instructions immediately prior to delivery, it was to be

placed in one of the footlockers with one of the notes. The door of this

room was locked at all times after the above articles were placed therein.

The key on a string was worn around the neck of the member of the

family who was on duty to receive the call from the kidnaper. The

foreseeable things to be done immediately after receiving a call from the

kidnaper were divided among the Agents in the residence. The additional

preparation of the money and placing it into the automobile in the garage

- 19 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 144

---

## Page 145

was to be handled by one Agent and the COORS' brother on duty at

the time. The money was never delivered. It was accepted by

bank officials in the residence for return to the bank. It was in the

original sealed bag, avoiding the necessity of recounting the money.

It should be pointed out that the Person in Charge was

constantly advised by private telephone line of all arrangements and

activity described. This was done on a continuing basis.

The Person in Charge kept Agents in the residence

informed in detail as to his general thinking, and problems which could

occur involving the family. These telephone conferences on things

that might happen in the future made it possible for the Agents in the

residence to answer questions and make decisions with the family.

He in turn was advised of each question asked by the family and the

answer given. Through this manner, the Agents and Person in Charge

were consistent with the family in all matters.

The technical equipment making it possible for all Agents

at the residence to simultaneously carry on a conversation with the

Person in Charge eliminated the necessity of paraphrasing his

instructions and ideas and added to their ability to act in harmony.

The individual Agents in the victim's home also kept

each other advised of all conversations with and questions asked and

answers given to members of the family.

MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED

IN THE VICTIM'S RESIDENCE

Due to the arrival some days after the kidnaping, many

of the necessary things had been done in connection with the residence

assignment. Those items are mentioned in the manual and are not

being repeated here.

Agents, prior to entering the residence, in a conference

with the Person in Charge reached the conclusion that there was a strong

liklihood the victim was not alive.

On entering the residence, they felt that it was imperative

to receive as clear and detailed telephone call from the kidnaper as

possible. It was also felt necessary to associate with the family in

a manner that would result in them taking no action that would interfere

with the investigation of the case.

The family were continually reassured that the answers

to their questions and problems were given them by the Agents present,

with the full knowledge and consideration of the Person in Charge. It

was pointed out that the Person in Charge had much experience in

kidnaping cases, and in turn, on their behalf, was consulting with

FBI officials in Washington, D. C., including Mr. HOOVER himself.

In one instance, the family inquired as to the necessity

of the detailed coverage of the expected telephone call from the kidnaper.

- 21 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 146

---

## Page 147

In this instance, as well as every other opportunity, it was pointed

out to the family that the safe return of the victim was the first and

primary object of the FBI. That the necessity for complete coverage

of the phone call was first to make sure that clear instructions were

obtained from the kidnaper in order that they could be complied with,

resulting in the release of the victim. That, secondly, the coverage

might assist in leading to the identification and apprehension of the

individual responsible for the kidnaping.

The Agents in the residence were frank at all times in

answering the various questions and problems and tried to avoid

leaving any impression of mystery and evasiveness in their actions

and conduct.

JIM GRANT, after some time had elapsed and no

contact from the kidnaper had been received, asked the question, are

you actually going to pay the money to the kidnaper when it is

recognized the victim is dead? It was pointed out to him that was a

decision to be made by the family and they had already reached the

decision that the money would be paid whether or not he was alive.

Getting necessary items in and out of the house was

handled by BILL and JOE COORS, in that they exchanged shifts

daily, this presented no problem.

- 22 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526-Page 147

---

## Page 148

Permission to intercept and open all mail addressed

to the COORS' residence had previously been obtained and this was

handled at the Post Office. It placed no particular responsibility on

the Agents in the residence. However, contents of the extortion letters

intercepted at the Post Office were relayed over the direct line to the

Agents in the residence and were made known to the family for their

decision as to complying with them. No particular problem was

encountered in having them reach a decision. When practical, these

notes were presented in the A. M. in that MA RY COORS could respond

more logically then than later in the day.

The identity of several individuals were furnished by

members of the family as suspects. Particularly BILL COORS would

pursue the results and inquire in connection to these suspects very

persistently. Although few of the suspects from the very beginning

had any logical basis, it left a better impression with the family when

they could be advised rather promptly that that individual had been

eliminated as a suspect and why. Bearing in mind that at this stage

of the case, a very limited investigation was being conducted, it is

believed where logical, these suspects reported by the family should

be eliminated.

After the children had moved to the grandparents'

residence, they continued to be some bother to MARY COORS in

making requests of her for permission to go various places such as

- 23 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 148

---

## Page 149

school, skiing and visiting friends.

There were Agents stationed at the grandparents'

residence and after advising them of the children's bother to their

mother, they were able to eliminate it.

News Releases: The two COORS' brothers and

Mr. COORS, SR., as a matter of business policy and custom, had

lunch each day in the COORS, SR. residence located and adjoining their

place of business. At that time, they would discuss problems and have

a mutual agreement as to the solution. That custom continued over in

regard to this case. The major decisions that were reached in this

case concerning the family were reached at a conference of the COORS'

family, including MARY COORS and JIM GRANT, with the Person in

Charge being present. These conferences were held in COORS, SR.

residence, usually shortly after the lunch hour. In regard to press

releases, the COORS' family, in connection with their business, had a

press representative. The handling of the press releases were cleared

through him and he in turn would clear with the Person in Charge prior

to any release being made in connection with this case. On one occasion

later in the stay of the Agents in the residence, MARY COORS wanted to

make a final appeal through the press for the kidnaper to contact her.

The fact that she was thinking of this release was known to the Agents

in the residence a day or so ahead and finally she presented to them a

copy of her proposed release. At the suggestion of the Person in Charge,

some changes were made by MARY COORS and it was handled as stated above.

- 24 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 149

---

## Page 150

The family had decided that BILL Or JOE COORS,

under no circumstances, would personally deliver the ransom money.

JIM GRANT had volunteered to help in any way he could, including

delivering the ransom money. The Person in Charge of the investigation

had decided that JIM GRANT and one of the Agents in the residence

would jointly deliver the ransom money. In the event the ransom money

was to be delivered, one Agent, as previously described, was to handle the

final packaging of the ransom money. One Agent immediately on the

conclusion of the call was to transcribe verbatim the phone call for the

use of the Person in Charge. The third Agent was to furnish verbally

this information to and receive the final instructions from the Person in

Charge.

CECIL KENDRICK was the friend that MARY COORS

selected to have stay with her and who did stay with her for the first

week. On arriving at the COORS' residence, which was the next day

after the Agents arrived, she was cautioned about security features, but

was given a free rein to console and help MARY COORS in any way she

thought best. However, she was cautioned as to the possibility that the

victim might not be alive and to bear this in mind in offering MARY any

assurance on this point. CECIL KENDRICK had to leave the residence

for personal reasons and another friend, JAN PHIPPS, took her place

in the residence and she was given similar instructions.

- 25 -

_NW 55044 DocId: 32909526 Page 150

## Page 151

The possibility that the kidnaper might not recontact the

family was recognized from the outset by the Person in Charge.

Actually the kidnaper did not recontact the family. This

resulted in one of the principal problems for the Agents in the residence.

The problem being to assist the family in deciding on a date they would

no longer wait for a call and all out active investigation could begin.

This problem was not actually broached by the Agents

in the first instances. During the last several days of their stay in the

residence, on different occasions, individual members of the family

would open this subject. The problem would then be discussed with that

member in a specific and frank manner. The actual date was decided on

in a family conference at the COORS, SR. residence, the Person in

Charge being present.

Having a bearing on this problem, was one of the most

frequent questions asked by individual members of the family from the

outset. Is "AD" alive? The answer would consist of enumerating the

factual circumstances. From the beginning, their conclusions would be

that he probably was not alive, yet this same question would be put to an

Agent a short time later. Never was there any encouragement that he

was alive given to the family.

Another question: When will he (the kidnaper) call?

Here again, no encouragement was ever extended to the family. The

point was made that if "AD" was dead resulting in the kidnaper losing

- 26 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 151

---

## Page 152

his security, there might never be a call.

It is believed the frank approach to these questions,

as well as all others, from the outset, materially assisted in having

some influence with the family and their thinking in resolving their

problem of terminating the wait for a contact by the kidnaper.

SETTING UP CHIEF CLERK'S OFFICE ON

SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT CASES

When a major case has occurred and the investigation

is to be handled as a "special," of course, the SAC of the

office involved and the Bureau have discussed the matter as

to the number of Special Agent personnel necessary. In addition,

discussion is had as to the number of extra stenographers and

at least four clerical employees should be borne in mind as

being necessary to handle the "paper work" in connection with

the handling of a "special."

The field office in which the major crime has occurred

has already opened a case, for example, a kidnaping, and un-

doubtedly the first serial appearing therein will be a memorandum

of some Special Agent reflecting that he received a call from

someone advising that a particular individual has been kidnaped

or disappeared.

Probably the next serial, or Serial #2, will be a

copy of a teletype to the Bureau or a memorandum reflecting

a telephone call with the Bureau.

Subsequent serials will reflect, as a rule, memoranda

of different Agents as to what they have done or information

they have received.

In connection with the handling of a "special,"

arrangements should first be made to obtain some particular

section of the office which will be away from other Agents of

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 153

---

## Page 154

the office and away from the public so that the inspector cr

man in charge of the "special" can have his grcup in one space.

The temporary Chief Clerk's Office (CCO) should, of course, be

allocated a corner or section of thât area, and the office in

question should already make arrangenents to have brought in a

number of extra file cabinets and other office supplies which

are used in the operation of a CCO.

Generally in the reguiar CCO, files contain a sumber

of serials; for example, one lile or volume may possibly con

tain 75 to 100 serials. However, in connection wish a "speciai,"

it has been found that if each volume contains only 25 serials,

this helps a great deal; that is , Volume No. I should have

Serials I to 25, Volume No, 2 should have Serials 25 to 56, and

so forth. The reason for breaking down these volumes containing

only 25 serials is that as the case progresses Agents will have

to refer to references and previous serials and li severa.

Agents have to look in one volume which would contain a hundred

serials, it would involve a loss of time, and so forth, whereas

smaller volumes will be more readily available.

In addition to starting these volumes containing ont

25 serials, sub-files should immediately be opened in ordes fu

channel into that sub-file an extra copy of à memorandum, alrel

or teletype..

foi exanple, as soon as a "special" is started, there

will be a number of conmunications referring to Agents, stencgraphers

and clerical employees leaving their headquarters city

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 154'

---

## Page 155

for the office where the "special" is being handled. Instead of

having all of these communications put in the regular investi-

gative file, this type of communication should be placed in a

sub-file which can be given a number, for example, Sub-file A,

and it can be entitled "Personnel Matters." With this sub-file

in existence, any subsequent correspondence relating to personnel

should be placed in that file and no copies be placed in the

regular investigative file. Then, if the person in charge of

the "special" or his assistants need any information regarding

personnel, the same is readily available in one volume.

At about the same time the Bureau will probably issue

instructions that a weekly communication should be forwarded to

the Bureau setting forth cost data, and a sub-file should be

opened for that phase. In other words, the Bureau will issue

instructions to the office where the "special" is being handled

to notify all offices to submit weekly communications relative

to the extra cost involved. All of these communications should

be placed in that particular sub-file and no copies should be

placed in the main investigative file. For example, this section

can be called Sub-file B and it can be entitled "Cost Data."

As soon as the newspapers start publishing their

articles, there will be many newspaper articles and a sub-file

should be opened which, for example, can be Sub-file C entitled

"Newspaper Clippings." A copy of every newspaper item should

be placed in this sub-file and, of course, an extra copy be

- 3 -

_NW.55044DocId:32989526 Page 155

---

## Page 156

forwarded to the Bureau daily. In addition, these newspaper

clippings should be reviewed for possible leads and all

pertinent names appearing therein should be indexed. These

newspaper clippings will, of course, be properly mounted,

serialized and initialed before being placed in this sub-file.

The Bureau will generally issue instructions to

submit a daily teletype summary; and it has been found advisable

to place the regular copies in the regular investigative file;

but an extra copy should be placed in a sub-file, for example,

Sub-file D, entitled "Daily Summaries." By having an extra

copy in this sub-file, one can readily refer to that file which

will contain a day-by-day summary of the activities that have

been described to the Bureau.

Of course, another sub-file should be opened which

should contain instructions relative to the logs that are

maintained at the commencement of the "special" in order that

all such information will be readily available in one sub-file.

It is also advisable to open a sub-file to contain an extra

copy of "Narrative Memoranda."

Inasmuch as the telephone company will be contacted

immediately and interviews will be had with various telephone

officials, all of which will be recorded in memorandum form,

it is deemed advisable to open a sub-file, which can be

entitled "Confidential Telephone File," and all copies of

memoranda submitted regarding the installation of telephones,

contacts with the phone company, and so forth, should be

-4 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 156

---

## Page 157

=

placed in this file and no copies at all be placed in the

investigative file. Again, if one desires to know what has

been done in connection with the telephone situation, this

one sub-file is readily available and should contain all

pertinent data.

As a rule, neighboring offices will be instructed

by teletype or telephone calls to ship in to the interested

office extra equipment that might be needed and in order to

have this information available and in one file, a sub-file

should be opened, which probably can be entitled "Equipment,"

and copies of all communications, and so forth, can be

placed in this file so that the property man or Agent in

charge of the property can readily have available and in

one file all information relative to equipment that has

been shipped in, rented or obtained from other sources.

• If the major crime receives publicity, as it

undoubtedly will, there will be many communications prepared

relative to contacts with the press, TV or radio stations,

and it has been found advisable to open a sub-file, which

can be entitled "press Services," and in this file a copy

of the memoranda should be placed, whereas the original and

other copies will be in the investigative file. Again, if

any question comes up regarding the press, and so forth,

a copy of every communication is in this one sub-file, which

will be readily available.

- 5 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 157

---

## Page 158

A similar sub-file should be opened which can be

entitled "Western Union." This sub-file should reflect results

of contact with Western Union officials and, again, all copies

of such communications should be placed in this sub-file.

In connection with a kidnaping case, the question

of circularizing arises, and it has been found advisable to

open a sub-file, which can be entitled "Ransom Circularization,"

and in this file should be placed an extra copy of each communi-

cation relating to this phase of the investigation. Of course,

the original and other copies are in the investigative file,

but, again, by having an extra copy in the sub-file, the

person handling that particular phase will have at his fingertips

copies of all communications relating to that matter.

When the unknown subject is identified and, for

example, a wanted flyer or identification order is prepared,

it has been found that the office supervisor in the case will

on a number of occasions instruct other offices to circularize,

for example, bus depots, barber shops, and so forth. When this

is done, the other offices will send a letter or communication

advising that the particular circularization has been done,

and it has been found of an assistance to have a sub-file opened

entitled, for example, "Wanted Flyer Circularization," and an

extra copy of that communication is designated for that sub-file.

At the start of a kidnaping case, of course, written

authority will be obtained from the victim's family or close

- 6 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 158

---

## Page 159

friends relative to checking mail at the Post Office, and it

has been found advisable to open a sub-file, which can be

entitled "Post Office File," and place therein all communi-

cations or memoranda relating to this phase of the investi-

gation and do not place copies in the regular investigative

file. If the person in charge, or someone else, desires to

know what the situation is relative to the inquiry made or

set up at the Post Office, this file will have all information

in it.

It has also been found advisable to open a sub-file

which will contain a copy of all memoranda or other communi-

cations which more or less contain "policy matters" or

instructions given by the Bureau to the person handling

the special assignment or contain suggestions, and so forth.

The originals, of course, which would be memoranda, teletypes

or airtels, would be placed in the investigative file, but

a copy should be placed in this sub-file so that the same

will be readily available to the person in charge or his

assistants if any information is desired as to Bureau policy

or instructions.

In addition, of course, an exhibit and 1-A files are

opened and maintained similar to that in the regular field

division office.

It has also been found advisable to open another

file and to entitle it "Informants." As time goes on, all

-7 =

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 159

---

## Page 160

offices, especially the office handling the "special," will

be asked to contact all criminal informants, potential

criminal informants, and other sources, and the office in

question will probably submit an extra copy of FD-209

reflecting a contact with an informant, and instead of

putting that in the investigative file, it should be

designated for the sub-file.

Likewise, other offices will

from time to time send an airtel or letter reflecting

results of their informants and, again, all copies should

be placed in this sub-file.

At the commencement of each "special," as a rule,

inquiries are conducted regarding transportation facilities

and, as a result, much information,

pamphlets, and so forth,

will be obtained relative to airplane, train, bus, and other

means of transportation, and it has been found advisable to

place all copies of such information in a sub-file, which

can be entitled "Transporation," so that the Special Agent

handling that particular phase will have readily available

in one file all such data.

Many green sheets, of course, will be prepared

containing bulky exhibits and other pieces

of evidence,

and a sub-file should be opened containing an extra copy

of those so that they will be readily available at any

time.

.. .

- 8 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 160

## Page 161

As the case progresses, undoubtedly criminal

records will be obtained from the Identification Division

of the Bureau, and it has been found that instead of

placing them in the investigative file that a sub-file

should be opened and all criminal records be placed in

this sub-file and, of course, indexed to that sub-file.

Here again, one will have in a particular volume, or

volumes, nothing but identification records which will

be more readily available than having to go through the

investigative file for them.

In connection with a kidnaping, the victim's

family or relatives will undoubtedly receive a number

of letters fron "nuts," "crackpots," and from respectable

people, and it has been found advisable that instead of

placing these in the regular investigative file that a

sub-file should be opened and they should be placed

therein and, of course, indexed and serialized so that

one, again, will have in one volume all such letters that

have been received.

In connection with a kidnaping, one probably will

receive at least one or more letters, and it has been found

advisable to open a sub-file which will contain either

photostatic copies or photographic copies of such letters

which are known to come from the kidnaper. The purpose

of this sub-file is so that Agents in connection with their

- 9 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 161

---

## Page 162

investigation can readily read and observe the type of communi-

cation that was sent and, of course, this file will have photo-

graphic copies and not the original.

As a rule in connection with a kdinaping case, there

will be a large

nunber of other extortion letters which are

received and, oi course, when it is readily known that such

type of letters do not come fron the isidnaper, separate

Extortion (9) cases should be opened and handled by the

personnel in the office and not by the nen on the special

assignnent. However, in order to keep a record as to such

letters, and so forth, it has been found advisable to

open a sub-file and to see to it that an extra copy of the

main communication to the Bureau is placed in this file.

For example, in connection with a kidnaping case, the first

crackpot letter that is received can be given number "1,"

the next number "2," and so forth, then, as these new "g"

cases are opened and a letter is sent to the Bureau in that

"g" case, an extra copy should be designated for the sub-file

and one can thereafter pick up this sub-file and readily

observe just what other extortion letters have been received.

As the case progresses, one will receive many

FBI Laboratory reports, and it has been found that instead

of placing these in the regular investigative file that a

sub-file should be opened and all copies should be filed in

that sub-file after being serialized, indexed, and so forth,

- 10 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 162

---

## Page 163

so that one will have in one sub-file every FBI Laboratory

report that has been submitted.

A similar sub-file can be opened up which should

contain Latent Fingerprint Section communications.

Of course, a photograph file is also opened and

maintained similar to that of the exhibit file.

The opening of the main investigative file and these

sub-files, of course, is to conform with Bureau instructions

relative to the operations of a CCO, and the items appearing

in these sub-files, of course, are serialized, stamped,

initialed, and so forth, and are indexed.

The main purpose in having such sub-files referred

to above is so that during the early stages of the investi-

gation of the major case, one can readily "put his finger"

on certain communications or correspondence that the person

in charge or his assistants may want to quickly or readily

refer to.

Each major case may present different problems

and in some types of cases one may want to open additional

sub-files which again should contain only a copy of the

communications or memorandum.

For example, in almost every

kidnaping case much investigation will be conducted relative

to identifying the type of paper, and it has been found that

in addition to filing the original and copy of the communi-

cation or memorandum in the main investigative file that

- 11 -

WW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 163

---

## Page 164

:

an extra copy be designated for a sub-file which can

1 be

entitled "Ransom Paper project." The Agents handling

that particular phase of the investigation will readily

have available in one sub-file copies of all communi-

cations relating to that phase. The same would apply

to possibly identifying a typewriter if a typewriter

was used in the preparation of the ransom letter or

letters.

After the segular investigative file and

whatever sub-files that are needed are opened, the problem

arises as to seeing to it that the information appearing

in these files can be readily found and located when needed.

By this time, some clerical employee will have

been designated as the Chief Clerk of the "special," or,

as in some cases, a regular Chief Clerk will be brought in

to the office where the "special" is being handled and at

that tine indices will have to be set up and organized.

The regular index in the ordinary CCO is broken

down alphabetically by the name of the person or firm and

then there will be indices for motor numbers of automobiles,

guns, and a few other items; however, in connection with a

"special," the chief Clerk or one of the other clerks who

will handle that phase should be instructed to immediately

set up a number of other type of guide cards. For example,

index cards will, of course, be filed alphabetically:

- 12 =

NW 35044 DoaFd+32969526-Page-164.

---

## Page 165

automobiles will be indexed and filed by motor number.

The same should apply. for guns, typewriters, and other

items. In other words, special guide cards should be

placed therein, for example, "Guns," "Typewriters."

As the case goes along, one may want other breakdowns

and guide cards can be placed therein. For example,

guide cards can be made for the words "Bodies," "Bloody

Cars," "Evidence," "Phone Numbers," and numerous other

items.

In connection with the indices maintained in

a "special," one should see to it that such items are

marked for indexing and are indexed because as the case

progresses many times an individual will recall some

incident relating to a bloody car or a telephone number

or to something else but cannot recall the name of the

person involved; however, by having such breakdowns in

the indices, one can readily refer to them and find the

communication in question.

In addition, instead of making one index card,

two index cards should be made. For example, Serial #1

will probably contain a memorandum of a Special Agent to

the SAC reflecting that a Mr. JOHN SMITH, for example,

of say Jones and Company, phoned and stated that his

nephew, JOHN BLACK, was believed kidnaped and that

JOHN BLACK is the president of Black Corporation. In

- 13 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 165

---

## Page 166

:

connection with this particular memorandum, which would be

Serial #1 probably, one would readily see that the

individual marking such communication for indexing will

underline all four of the above names and duplicate

index cards should be made with a little identifying

data on each card, and the copy of these index cards

will be filed in the "speical" indices while the criginal.

will subsequently be forwarded to the main CCO in that

particualr field division

for filing in their main and

permanent indices.

The CCO of the field division, not the temporary

special CCO, when they receive the above original four

cards, should receive instructions that they are to search

those cards, and if there are any references, they should

be placed on the Indices Search Slip, FD 160, and returned

to the "special squad" so that they can be assigned out

and such references reviewed to determine whether or not

any of the information may be of interest or value to

the regular office or to the "special squad."

The regular CCO should also be instructed that

after they have once received the index card, for example,

On JOHN BLACK, and the clerk notes that there already

has been a card filed referring to the "special case,"

they need not send back any additional Indices Search

Slips, but only when they receive an index card bearing

- 14 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 166

---

## Page 167

..

a new name which has not been indexed to the "special case."

Say for example, the first memorandum, or Serial

#1, made reference to the person phoning in stating that he

had heard there was a "body" found in a certain lake and

that he did not know whether that body might belong to the

victim or not. The person marking communications for

indexing would, of course, underline the word "body" in

blue so that the clerks in the temporary CCO handling the

"special" would then know that Serial #1 should be indexed

under the caption of "Body." This procedure should like-

wise be followed for any similar breakdowns as mentioned

above.

In addition, the CCO in charge of the "special

squad" should obtain a file box, 42 x 5½ * 10", in which

3"x5" cards can be filed. In this box there should be

prepared guide cards for each of the field offices and

they should be filed in alphabetical order, including

guide cards for legal attaches, as well as a separate

guide card for the Bureau and a separate guide card for

the office in which the "special" is being handled:

for example, Volume I which contains Serial #1, mentioned

heretofore, which is a memorandum of a Special Agent in

that office prepared for his SAC. The 3'x5" index card

behind the office, for example, Denver, where the special

-15 -

WW 55044DocId:32989526 Page 167

---

## Page 168

:

is being handled, should have typed in the center of the

3''x5" card, on top, "Denver."

On the first line on this card should be placed

a little resume as to that particular serial. For example:

"S. I

SA BROWN memo 6/1/60, SAC re JOHN SMITH

phoning re disappearance of JOHN BLACK.

For example, Serial #2, in Volume I, would

probably be the office teletype to the Bureau or would

be a memorandum reflecting a phone call to the Bureau,

and the guide card marked "Bureau" will have an index

card and similar information will be placed on that card

for Serial #2.

As the volumes containing the investigative file

are made and each contains 25 serials, one of the clerical

employees should be designated to see to it that this

particular index box, with cards, is maintained up-to-date

and as quickly as possible. The purpose of this particular

box of cards is to show what communication has been sent

to or received from a particular office or to the Bureau.

For example, the Bureau guide card will later on have a

number of cards and one can, by readily looking at these

cards, get a resume or idea as to the gist of those

communications referred to, and if the person in charge

or one of his assistants asks for a particular piece of

correspondence, by checking this special indices one can

)

- 16 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 168

---

## Page 169

:

:

readily find the same.

It is to be notedthat separate index cards are

not made for each serial. For example, behind the guide

card marked "Bureau" will be at first only one index card

and on that index card will be typed a resume of the

contents of the connunications,

say, for example, for

ten different serials, and that card, of course, is marked

in the upper right-hand corner "1." When that card is

filled, card "2" is placed behind it, card "3," and so forth.

To reiterate, the person in charge asks for a com-

munication received from the Miami Office three weeks

previously and one can go to this index box, look behind

"Miami," look up and down the few cards that are there, and

can readily locate the communication he is interested in.

In this box the section for the office where this

"special" is being worked out of will, of course, have

numerous cards and it has been found on many occasions to

be of assistance to refer to that guide card, say, for

example, "Denver," when looking for some communications,

especially when the name of the person is not recalled,

and by glancing up and down these cards one will quickly

and readily find the communication desired. One clerical

employee can generally be kept busy merely handling this

phase of the project, as such employee, as new volumes are

made, will take a volume and take this index box with the

- 17 -

NW 53044 Docia: 32989526Rage 169-

---

## Page 170

cards and add such information on the necessary cards. To

further explain it, for example, the New York Office sends

a communication in to the Denver Office reflecting an inter-

view with THOMAS JONES. This communication, after being

serialized, is noted by the clerk who will add the serial

number onto the index card of the New York Office showing

that serial number so and so relates to interview with

THOMAS JONES.

Going back to the special indices which are

being maintained, it was mentioned before that the original

card will go to the front office or to theCCO in that

division while the copy will be retained in the special

indices.

)

The special indices, of course, should be

informative and should not merely contain the name of

an individual, an automobile, an address, or something

like that, and the serial number to which it relates.

For example, the inspector's assistant or No. 1

man, or whatever title he has, who handles the mail

consisting of teletypes, reports, airtels and memoranda,

generally should mark for indexing, by underlining in

blue pencil, what items in that communication he believes

should be indexed. Of course, at first, preference should

be given to over-indexing, and by that is meant that in

a particular communication almost every name, whether of

- 18 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 170

---

## Page 171

an individual or a firm, should be indexed. On many occasions

telephone numbers of suspects or underworld characters should

be marked for indexing, as well as possibly their addresses.

In the meantime, of course, the special indices will have guide

cards for such telephone numbers, addresses, and so forth. In

addition, if the communication makes reference to a body or to

some other item, that should be marked for indexing.

In other words, when that piece of correspondence

leaves the desk of the inspector's assistant, No. I man, or

whatever he is called, it is underlined in blue and, of course,

is marked with other notations as to a copy being designated

for a certain Agent or a lead slip to be made, and so forth,

and these items will be mentioned later.

If a capable clerical employee is obtained, such

employee can be given instructions as to how to maintain the

informative index, and after such employee gets the "knack,"

that employee can handle this phase of the work, thereby

Saving the services of a Special Agent who would otherwise

have to dictate the same to a stenographer.

Such clerical employee in the temporary CCO of

the "special," when he gets that communication, will, if

there has been no previous index card made, make two index

cards for the name of the suspect. The original, as

mentioned before, will go to the regular CCO in that division;

however, on these two cards the clerk will type a brief narrative,

- 19 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 171

---

## Page 172

:

• for example, that Serial 25 reflects the suspect THOMAS WHITE

was interviewed by the New York Office on a certain date and

established an alibi. If the comnunication made reference to

a body being found in a lake, the clerk would automatically

know that under the guide card for "Bodies" there would be an

index card and on that index card he would put a sentence or

two reflecting what that communication said regarding the

body referred to therein.

In other words, a clerical employee properly instructed

can maintain this special indices which has been set up for the

"special squad." In addition, if these clerical employees are

instructed properly, they will be always on the alert for tying

in names, addresses, telephone numbers, and other items as such

information is being recorded on such cards.

For example, the indices may have a card for a certain

individual being an ex-convict and as being a possible suspect.

A week or two later another communication comes to that clerk's

attention wherein references is made to a similar name of an

individual who might have had a suspicious car in his possession.

As those two names are matched up, an alert clerical employee

will call it to the attention of someone who can determine what

further action can be taken.

The person in charge of the clerical employees, who

can be referred to as the temporary Chief Clerk, will, of course,

see that the communications,

memoranda, and so forth are serialized

- 20 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 172

---

## Page 173

and disseminated into the proper files or sub-files and so forth,

and will also see that the operation of the temporary CCO is

being handled in accordance with Bureau instructions for a

regular CCO.

A fourth clerical employee will always find other .

similar duties and, as mentioned before, if at least four clerical

employees are assigned at the start, one can, as a rule, keep up

with the indexing, serializing and recording, as this is an im

portant phase of the Bureau's work, and if there are not enough

clerical employees, these matters get behind and one will never

get caught up.

Bulky exhibits, of course, should be filed and retained

in accordance with existing Bureau instructions, and in some

cases it is advisable to obtain a large metal cabinet into which

can be placed items and evidence which is obtained in connection

with the "special." This locked cabinet should, of course, be

located in the temporary CCO so that such items are available to

the Agents on the "special" rather than having to go into the

special room generally maintained by the office in question.

In connection with "special" assignments, it is well

to immediately notify all offices to furnish at least three copies

of all reports, teletypes, airtels, memoranda, and so forth, in

order that an extra copy may be available for the sub-files if

occasion arises.

SETTING UP OF LEAD BOXES ON

SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT CASES

In connection with a special

assignment in a field

division, the official in charge of the special assignment

will generally designate a Special Agent to handle the leads.

The first thing that should be done is to obtain

about eight wooden or metal index card boxes, 44x5}x10", which

will contain 3"x5" index cards. The first box to be set up

should be a box containing guide cards and these guide cards

should contain the typewritten name of each Agent who is going

to work on the "special."

On a special assignment a number of Special Agents

will be brought in from other offices and, as a rule, a certain

number of Special Agents from the local office in which the

crime was committed will be assigned to work under the inspector

in charge or other Bureau official. At first, one generally

is not acquainted with all personnel and it is a good idea to

prepare these guide cards by color, possibly type the name of

the Agents in on special assignment on a card which will have

a white background and say, for example, the Agents assigned

to the local office will have a green background tab.

The

person handling the leads will then readily know as to what

Agents are local Agents and as to what Agents are visiting,

which will greatly assist him at the conmencement of the case.

= 22 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 174

---

## Page 175

In addition, at the end of the guide cards should be set

up guides for the Resident Agents who from time to time

will be covering leads in connection with this "special."

This box, of course, containing these guide cards, should

be marked "Agents."

Another similar box should be set up containing

guide cards for the Bureau and all offices. These guide

cards should be filed alphabetically, with the Bureau

guide card at the front.

As it will be noted, the above two index boxes

relate to Special Agents and to offices, and into these

two boxes will be placed the lead cards, to be described

hereinafter, which are prepared for a Special Agent

covering a lead or for a particular office which has

been requested to cover a lead. In addition to these

two boxes, sometimes the individual handling this phase

of the investigation might desire to have two similar

extra boxes made; that is, one for the Special Agents

and one for the Bureau and field offices, in order

that a copy of the lead slip, after the lead has been

covered, can be placed behind the Agent's name or

behind the office; however, maintaining these two boxes

involves extra work and sometimes is not essential.

The two or three extra lead card boxes

should then have placed therein guide cards under

- 23 -

_NW 55044-DocId-32989526 Page 175

---

## Page 176

various headings, which will be explained in more detail

hereinaiter.

After the inspector or Bureau official handling

the case looks over each piece of correspondence, such as

teletypes, airtels, letters, memoranda, or reports, he

will generally make some notations thereon as to "leads,"

or other comments as to what he believes should be done

or not done and after he initials it, it is routed on to

the special Agent assigned to reviewing same to make up

leads.

For example, an airtel will come in from an

eastern office stating that someone there reported

JOHN BROWN as being a suspect inasmuch as JOHN BROWN

is an ex-convict and lives in the same city where the

crime occurrad. On this communication, for example, an

airtel, a notation is made,

such as:

"Make suspect lead

card." The conmunication is then narked for indexing

with blue pencil and such pertinent information will be

underlined, such as the suspect's name, possibly his

address or telephone number, license number of his car,

if given, and motor number of car, if given. If it is

known to whon the lead is going to be assigned, the second

copy should then contain the name of the Agent who will

get the lead and a notation is made thereon:

"Lead slip

to follow." If there is any question as to the handling

of that lead, and so forth, there will be written opposite

- 24 -

Nw 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 176

)

---

## Page 177

:

the name of the Agent a notation to see the particular

Special Agent assigning that lead.

The original of this communication, which will

contain possibly comments or notations of the inspector

or Bureau official handling the case, as well as the

blue markings, and so forth, should always be retained

in the investigative file and the second copy should be

charged out to the Agent who is to handle the lead. The

third copy, of course, can likewise be retained in the

investigative file unless some reason exists that the

third copy should be placed in one of the sub-files

previously discussed, and if

so, a notation is made on

the original and copy of the effect that a copy has

been designated for a particular sub-file.

The communications, memoranda, and so forth,

after being properly marled for indexing, and so forth,

will then be picked up by the Chief Clerk handling the

special assignment and that party will serialize these

comnunications into volumes containing only 25 serials

apiece. As mentioned heretofore, these volumes will

then be taken by the other clerical employees and index

cards will be prepared, as related previously.

The Special Agent or individual handling the

leads will also several times a day take these particular

volumes and dictate lead cards.

For example, an Agent will pick up Volume V,

- 25 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 177

---

## Page 178

containing serials 101 to 125. This volume, which has

25 serials, will have the original of each communication in

it; that is, the teletype, report, memorandum, or airtel,

and, as mentioned above, the same will have notations as

to which communications lead slips should be made for.

The Agent will then dictate lead slips to a stenographer

and the lead slips should be typed in triplicate and not

in duplicate. In the upper right-hand corner, of course,

will be the file number and the serial number to which

the communication relates. On the left-hand side should

be the city or village in which the lead is to be covered.

In the

center of the lead card will ba placed the sub-

heading; for example, as mentioned in the above communi-

cation, the suspect's name would be placed in the center

with the word "Juspect" after it.

The Agent dictating the lead should then give

a little resume as to what the lead is about and if any

specific instructions are to be given. For example, say

that SA BROWN was routed the copy of the communication

referred to above which had a notation for him to either

see the "lead man" or else it might have the notation:

"Lead slip to follow." In dictating this lead, one would

say something as follows aiter having the above three

headings filled in on the lead

siip; that is, city,

suspect,

serial number:

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 178

---

## Page 179

"SA BROWN has copy above reflecting

Mrs. MABEL WHITE, 1000 Peach Street,

City, phoned on a certain date and

• believed above should be considered

as suspect inasmuch as he is ex-convict

and lives in vicinity where victim

worked or lived.

Check office and

special case indices. Ascertain

whereabouts pertinent date. show photo,

compare prints, handle as regular suspect."

After the stenographer types this lead, consisting

of three copies, it is advisable to blockstamp either the

front or back of it and place the Agent's name to whom the

lead is assigned on all three copies. If one knows that a

certain Agent is to get the lead, he can dictate that to

the stenographer at the same time and she can type the

Agent's name and date on the lead in addition to the

blockstamp.

When this lead is dictated, a notation is then

made on the original communication that this lead was

dictated and one can merely write the word "done" with

his initials and date after the notation:

"Make suspect

lead slip."

When these leads are returned by the stenographer,

the original, of course, should be placed in the lead box

for "Agents" behind the name of the Agent in question.

-27-

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 179

---

## Page 180

The second copy of this same lead is then routed

to the Agent who is to handle the lead or investigation.

One will still have a third copy of this lead and,

as mentioned above, there will be extra lead card boxes and

inasmuch as this lead relates to a particular suspect, an

index tab card should be nade on which will appear the name

of this suspect and that is filed in the lead box alpha-

betically and the third copy of the lead slip will be

placed behind that.

In other words, if an inquiry is made as to who

was handling a certain suspect, one can go to this box and

look under the name of the person - suspect, and there will

be a copy of that lead slip in that section reflecting the

name of the Agent to whom assigned.

In some major cases one may have many, many

suspects who have io be investigated and checked out and

there will be a number of these tab cards with the name

of the suspect appearing thereon.

As each "special" case develops, one may want

to have different projects or breakdowns.

For example,

one may want to have a breakdown entitled "Crime Scene."

In regard to the crime scene investigatic,

possibly ten igents may be assigned to ii or in that area

and as these leads are made, the original, as mentioned

above, is placed behind the Agent's name, the second copy

~ 28 =

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 180

---

## Page 181

is given to the Agent, and the third copy goes behind the

section entitled "Crime Scene." By picking up these leads

behind the section "Crime Scene," one may readily note or

observe what Agents have assignments that relate to that

particular matter.

For example, one may desire to set up a subsection

entitled "Hats," inasmuch as a hat may have been found at

the scene of the crime. Although one Agent may possibly

be assigned to handle and coordinate the hat project, still

there might be a hundred leads made for individuals to be

checked out who bought or owned similar hats. One can see

that as these leads are made up and assigned to say twenty

Agents, the original lead slip is behind the Agent's name,

the second copy goes to him, and the third copy would go

behind the subsection "Hats."

Each special assignment case presents its own

problems as to what subheadings have to be placed into

these lead box sections and the following are a few:

Victim's home affairs

Victim's business affairs

Victim's route men

Typewriter project

• Paper project

Dodge project

Bloody car project

- 29 -

LNW 55044-DocId:32989526 Page 181

---

## Page 182

Body project

Hideout project

Terrain search project

By having these leads set forth above, one can

look into the one box for Agents and readily account for,

and observe, each lead that is assigned to that particular

Agent or what project he is handling or working on.

Each Special Agent working on the squad, of

course, will have the second copy of the lead slip and :

at any time he can be called to the desk and have his

leads compared and checked with the ones appearing behind

his name.

The third copy, as mentioned above, will be in

the various 'boxes under the various projects.

If possible, it is best to line up the suspects

and projects in alphabetical order; that is, the first

sub-card could be for a suspect named JOHN ABBOTT, the

next sub-card in bach of him could be MIKE BLACK, the

third sub-card would be "Crime Scene." In other words,

these sections of the index boxes should be placed

alphabetically if possible.

By having the above type of setup, one can

readily find or know who is working on certain projects

or who is handling certain suspects.

When an Agent handles a lead, say, for example;

on a certain suspect, and he dictates, it is well to have

i 30:=

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 182

:

instructions issued to have the Agent's lead card, which

is the second copy, marked by him that it is either covered

or done and have him place his initials in the blockstamp

and give it to the stenographer so it will accompany the

memorandum or stencil or cormunication: that he has prepared,

and when it comes back over the desis, that lead slip is then

noted. . If it is marked "done" or "covered," the original

lead slip behind the Agent's name in the Agents' lead box

should then be removed.

If one has the extra box, described above, con-

taining the guide cards for Agents' names, this original

can then be placed in that box, which can be referred to

as a "closed" box, behind the Agent's name. If this box

is maintained, it gives a ready reference as to all leads

that have been assigned to an Agent while working on the

"special;" however, as a rule, it does not serve any other

purpose and sometimes is not used.

With the original lead slip being filed in the

box referred to above, one should then go to the other

lead box, under the name of the suspect, which will contain

the third copy of the lead slip. That lead slip can then

be destroyed and it should be replaced with the second copy

of the lead slip containing the Agent's initials and notation

that the lead was done.

Say, for example, one wants to note or obtain a

brief resume as to what was developed at the crime scene

area, one can refer to the index box and look at all of

-31 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 183

---

## Page 184

:

the lead slips behind "Crime Scene," and if and when that

investigation is done, all of those lead slips should be

marked "done" or "covered" and have the Agent's initials

thereon, and by looking at this group of lead slips, one

will get a brief resume as to whom was talked

to in that

area or what evidence was found, and so forth. Once in

a while one will ask as to what was the name of a certain

person interviewed down near the crime scene, and by

glancing through these closed lead slips, one can possibly

come up with the name as it will probably appear on one

of the leads.

As mentioned previously, one will also have a

lead box containing leads for other offices, which lead

box should have guide cards filed alphabetically. In

structions will have to be given to the stenographers

first that whenever they prepare a teletype, airtel,

or letter, they should prepare an original and one copy

of a lead slip for that office, which lead slip is pre-

pared in a similar manner to that prepared for leads

to Agents; however, in the upper left-hand corner instead

of having the name of the city or village, there should

appear the name of the office which will be covering the

lead and not the name of a particular city in a field

division.

Say, for example, an Agent handling TOM BROWN •

Suspect, has information which has to be checked out and

-32-

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 184

## Page 185

• i

verified by another office. He will dictate an airtel

setting

forth his information and specific lead. The

stenographer, after being instructed, will automatically

prepare this

lead slip with a little resume of the

information appearing thereon, and as that airtel comes

over

the desk,

and after being signed, the copies with

the lead slip will be routed on to the CCO handling the

special assignment; however, it is advisable to make a

notation in the lower left-hand corner, on the top of the

copies, for example, "NYC lead made." The lead slip is

not detached but goes along with the copies of the

correspondence, and in the CCO handling the special

project, alter that communication is serialized, the

serial number is placed on these two lead slips,

in pencil, and then the lead is sent back to the desk

and, of course, the original of the lead will be

placed behind the tab, for example, "New York," and

the second copy of the lead will be placed behind

the tab for that particular suspect in the lead box.

The Agent handling this suspect or dictating the

airtel does not need a copy of this lead for the

reason that he should be aware as to what he is doing

and has done regarding that suspect. He also knows

that at any time he can come to the desk and look in

the index lead box and look behind the name of his

- 33 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 185

---

## Page 186

suspect and he will see copies of the various leads that

have been made in connection with that suspect and will

give him a bird's-eye view as to what leads are outstanding

in other offices regarding his suspect.

By having this office lead box, one can keep tab

on other offices to see that they are covering all leads

they have been instructed to handle, and if such leads are

delinquent, their attention can be called to same by

routing slip or other communication.

When a particular office covers a lead and

their communication comes over the desk, the original

lead slip behind the name of that office is then pulled

and it is advisable to make a notation thereon, for

example, "Done NYC airtel (certain date)." Inasmuch

as that lead makes reference to a certain suspect,

the guide card for the name of the suspect should be

referred to and the original lead slip can be placed

behind that guide card reflecting the investigation

• was done.

As mentioned above, the remaining copy,

instead of being destroyed, can be placed in the

"closed" box for all offices, which will give one a

picture of what leads other offices have covered.

As will be noted from the above lead cards

and boxes, if someone is later on interested in re-

checking back on a particular project or suspect,

-34 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 186

---

## Page 187

he can look in the lead boxes, under the name of the suspect,

to determine what leads have been set out and, of course,

they will contain the serial number which he probably wants,

or else he can go to the regular indices which are maintained

in the CCO for the "special squad" and check those indices,

which will give a resume as to the different communications.

Especially at the start of the investigation, many

leads will be made, some of which may not need to be covered

later and many leads will be unassigned. An index box or

two will have to be obtained and proper breakdowns or sub-

headings placed therein, for example, "Suspects," "Dodge Car

Project," "Typewriter Project," and so forth. The leads, as

they are typed, consisting of three copies, and which are

unassigned, will then be placed behind the respective sub-

headings, such as "Typewriter Project," "Hat Project," and

so forth. As investigation progresses, one can then look

in these lead boxes and see what

leads should be assigned

as they are filed behind the various subheadings.

As one knows, in a special assignment case more

important leads have to be handled at first, but some types

of leads cannot be handled until certain phases of other in-

vestigations have been completed, and if there are special

leads like this, they should be placed in a separate subheading,

properly marked and identified, to be given special attention

later on when an active or open investigation is made.

• 35 -

In regard to lead cards or slips being retained for

a minimum of thirty days and thereafter being destroyed at

the discretion of the officer in charge of the investigation,

it is believed well to retain all such lead slips until the

case has actually been disposed of and closed, as oftentimes

reference is made to inquiries that were made many months

previously.

LAW ENFORCEMENT LIAISON

MAJOR CASE AND KIDNAPING TRAINING

In any major case, including kidnaping, close liaison would

be established with law enforcement agencies in the area where the crime

was committed. This liaison should include closest possible relationship

with state, county and city police, to insure that any information coming

to the attention of these agencies is obtained without delay.

To effect this coverage the inspector or official in charge of

the investigation will immediately assign Special Agents, probably on a

twenty-four hour a day basis, to the headquarters of the city police depart-

ment, the state police headquarters; and in a case which occurs in a rural county:

to the appropriate county sheriff's office.

Initial arrangements should be made through the head of

the respective department. Ideally, some officer in each police agency

will be assigned to handle the case for his department. At the time of the

initial contact, the Agent should explain the necessity of his being immediately

advised of all information possibly related to the case. The Agent should

request that instructions be issued that information received should be

immediately brought to the Bureau Agent's attention. It should be specifically

requested that all communications, such as telephone calls and letters,

be referred to a particular officer's office and that all individuals calling

in person at the department be sent to that office so that the Agent will be

able to immediately obtain and furnish the information to the Number 1 Man

on the case.

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 189

---

## Page 190

It should be pointed out that the information desired should

include any reports pertaining to suspicious persons who could have committed

the offense.

The officers should be requested to furnish the identity of any

individual and any information in their records concerning individuals in

their jurisdiction who have come to their attention and who might be

considered suspects. They should also be requested to furnish information

concerning missing persons or the disappearance of persons from the area

under suspicious circumstances, particularly when these occurred at the

time of the crime.

The officers should be alerted as to the items which might be

pertinent to the case and should be requested to be on the lookout for and

to furnish any information concerning abandoned automobiles, as well as

reports as to the location of clothing, guns, typewriters, jewelry or other

items found, which might be connected with the case. The officers should

be requested to immediately advise of any reports received of automobiles

containing bloodstains or of any unanswered suspicious reports pertaining

to bloodstains anywhere.

The officers should be requested to report murders and suicides,

and it should be pointed out that advice is particularly desired if a report

is received of a finding of a body that is possibly the victim. Arrangements

should be made to instruct all patrolmen, investigators and dispatchers so

that if a report of the finding of a body is received, the member receiving

this initial information should see to it that nothing is done to disturb

the area, and also insure the area is closely guarded and not disturbed.

NW 55044 DocId:32989526

Page 190

- 2 -

---

## Page 191

The police should be asked to preserve the crime scene until Bureau Agents

arrive and make a thorough crime-scene search. In cases of sheriff's

offices or other rural police, it may be well to point out the advisability

of having available about 500 feet of rope for possible use in protecting

the area where the body is found.

There will be other special projects that the Agents will be

required to handle at the local law enforcement offices, which might include:

(1) Examinatton of stolen car and stolen license reports

and a check to see if any of these stolen automobiles or

licenses could have been used in the crime. Particular

attention should be given to cars stolen before the crime

and not yet located.

(2) A check may be required of Auto Theft Bureau records

for suspicious automobiles of a particular make or description

similar to automobiles observed in the vicinity of the crime

scene.

(3) A check of identification records of the various departments

would be required on all suspects developed during the investigation

of the various projects.

Under an ideal situation when the Bureau enters a major case,

the law enforcement body in whose area the offense occurred would state they

were taking no action independent of that being taken by the Bureau, that they

would turn all information over to the Bureau and would render all possible

assistance to the FBI.

- 3-

## Page 192

• •

In the Coors kidnaping case, however, the sheriff in whose

county the offense occurred, even though his department was conducting

little or no active investigation, furnished stories to the press, radio and

television on a daily basis, claiming to be making inquiries and to be

investigating clues. The sheriff himself was soon determined to be thoroughly

unreliable and uncooperative. On the other hand, his undersheriff, NA, and

Captain of Investigations, both competent and reliable officers, were

completely cooperative. Liaison was set up with the undersheriff and

Captain of Investigations, and no contact was had with the sheriff on official

matters.

The Agent should furnish no information concerning the case

to local officers other than such information as is necessary to carry out

a specific inquiry. In other words, information should be furnished only

on a "need-know" basis. Any inquiry by the local officers as to the status

of the investigation could be answered by replying that the case is still

under active investigation, but that any pertinent developments of interest to

local authorities will be made known to them.

It should be borne in mind that local law enforcement officers

and other local officials will possibly not afford proper secrecy to

information pertaining to major cases which have publicity appeal due to

the interest of these officers and officials in politics and in receiving

publicity. Experience has shown that each department has its chain of

command in such a way that subordinate officers must advise their

superiors of significant information.

Then too, in a major case agreements

- 4 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 192

---

## Page 193

will exist between the various agencies as to action to be taken. For instance,

if a body of a victim is located in a particular county, the coroner will

immediately advise the sheriff and the District Attorney. These local

officials most likely will immediately advise the press media.

From the above, it is apparent that all possible arrangements

must be made to protect the crime scene and as thorough an investigation

conducted of the area as possible prior to the arrival of the coroner,

Sheriff and District Attorney, as the entry of these individuals into the

case will preclude any further possibility of investigating without being

hampered by press and curiosity seekers.

When a major case such as a kidnaping occurs, members of

the press will be stationed on a twenty-four hour a day basis at the

headquarters offices of the law enforcement agencies in the area. Any

Bureau Agent stationed at these headquarters must take every precaution

to be sure that no remark or action on his part provides a story prejudicial

to the best interests of the case.

Kidnapings, of course, are ordinarily cases of national interest,

therefore every local politician may desire to get into the picture in order

to enhance his political future. For instance, the Sheriff and District

Attorney of the county in which the kidnaping occurred will undoubtedly

attempt to drain every possible iota of publicity out of the kidnaping without

any consideration as to whether or not their seeling of publicity interferes

- 5 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 193

---

## Page 194

with the conduct and investigation of the case. For example, a kidnaping

may occur in one county and the remains of the victim may be found in a

second county. In such a case it becomes necessary to have arrangements

in both counties to handle any situation which might arise.

In the Coors case, the District Attorney and the Sheriff of

the county in which the kidnaping occurred, as well as the county in which

the remains of the victim were found, were all publicity seekers. Under

the laws of the State of Colorado, when any human remains are discovered the

coroner of the county must be notified immediately. In COORNAP, a man

who was firing a pistol in the county discovered the clothes of the victim

and immediately reported his finding to the Denver Office. This, of course,

presented the problem as to whether or not the coroner of the county in

which the clothes were found should be notified. If so, it would be incumbent

on the coroner to immediately notify the District Attorney of his county.

This problem was resolved by maintaining absolute silence and taking

twenty-six Agents into the wooded area and making a thorough search for

skeletal remains. This silence was maintained for three days. Meanwhile,

such bones as were found were submitted to a pathoiogist who agreed to

maintain absolute silence and at the end of three days advised the Denver

Office that some of the bones which had been found were of human origin.

Upon this discovery it was believed it was absolutely essential the

coroner in whose county the remains had been found should be notified.

It was explained to the coroner that a search of the area which surrounded

a dump resulted in the location of numerous bones and that it was not until

- 6 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 194

---

## Page 195

after examination by the pathologist, whose report had just been received, that

definite knowledge existed that human skeletal remains had been found.

This, of course, caused considerable consternation and angered

the Sheriff, District Attorney and coroner in the county in which the

remains were found. The Sheriff publicly announced he felt this was a most

uncooperative attitude on the part of the FBI. The District Attorney came

to the Denver Office and demanded all evidence in this case be turned over

to him, threatening the SAC with grand jury action, subpoenas and various

other types of threats; however, the evidence was not turned over to him.

At a later date he was given a list of the evidence which had been obtained

by the Bureau. The Sheriff of the county in which the evidence was found

finally, after his first outburst, had nothing further to say in the matter;

however, the Sheriff of the county in which the kidnaping occurred made

a considerable amount of news by flying out to Seattle to pick up the subject

of the case who was returned to Denver by Bureau Agents. This Sheriff

then took his grievance to the press and finally ended up by stating his

office was no longer open to Agents of the Bureau.

This matter is being included in this write-up since it is very

pertinent to anticipate in advance exactly how law enforcement officers

and agencies are to be handled in the event they become obstreperous.

It is also to be noted the District Attorney in both counties mentioned above,

were candidates for re-election and as a consequence tried to use this

case to enhance their chances for re-election; however, because of the

## Page 196

.

Bureau maintaining its silence and no comment attitude in connection with

the case and because of the loud ravings of these individuals, both were

defeated for re-election.

In conclusion, it should again be pointed out that the primary

purpose of establishing an Agent at headquarters of police departments

or other law enforcement agencies at the time of a kidnaping or other major

case is to insure that any information received by these departments is

immediately routed to the FBI.

LIAISON WITH THE TELEPHONE COMPANY

The immediate problem in setting up a tracing operation is to

determine the bounds within which it will be necessary to operate.

the coors case, the special Agent in Charge of the special Squad

determined at the outset that no interruption of service or noise on

the coors' telephone line could be evident to any person telephoning

the residence. The life of the Victim was in the balance. How do you

go about setting up a tracing operation under these conditions?

Here is how it was done in Denuer:

CONFERENCE WITH TELEPHONE COMPANY OFFICIALS

Original contact was made with the Chief Special Agent of the

Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co. (MS I & I Co.) on the day

the Bureau entered the case. This individual had a wide knowledge of

telephone procedures and was acquainted with key technical and

managerial personnel of the company. These people are the essential

ingredients for a successful tracing operation.

The Chief Special Agent called a meeting of key personnel to

map out a workable tracing arrangement. In attendance were.

1. Chief Special Agent

2. Supervising Service Foreman of the toll equipment section.

This foreman in Denuer is responsible for superuision of

all toll equipment including the Direct Distance Dialing (DDD)

equipment. His is a very technical type of position and his

knowledge of long distance circuits and procedures is almost

unlimited. The equipment under his supervision is valued at

_NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 197

ПАТРІЗМІМУ МОДЖЕМ

## Page 198

$15, 000, 000. His long distance equipment accounts for a

great portion of telephone company revènue.

3. Plant superintendent having responsibility for the area in

which the coors residence telephone was served.

4o. Supervising Service Foreman of the telephone exchange from

which the boors residence was serued.

5. District Iraific Superintendent who is responsible for all

Denver long distance operations.

6. Two sound trained FBI Special Agents.

The meeting was held at one of the local telephone exchanges

in the office of the Plant superintendent. This was done to auert the

possibility of press notice. Our requirements for coverage of the

Goors residence telephone were discussed in detail. Mays and means of

securing such coverage were left to the individuals most familiar with

each operation. None of the individuals were able to state specifically

at the meeting just exactly how the complete operation would be under-

taken but all left the meeting with a firm idea of the problems involved

and immediately began to develop a workable system of tracing the calls.

COORS RESIDENCE, NATIONAL 9-4455, MORRISON, COLORADO

The Coors residence was served from the Morrison, Colorado,

telephone exchange. Morrison is a suburb some fourteen miles from

Denuer.

The telephone exchange at Morrison is mornally unattended

except during daylight hours. The equipment in use at this exchange is

known as "step-by-step" equipment. This means simply, each time a

digit of the telephone number is dialed, the switching equipment "steps"

- 2 =

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 198

---

## Page 199

for each dial pulse until the connection is made.

A direct call to the Coors residence telephone could be made

from any other telephone in the Morrison exchange (NAtional 9) by

dialing the number. The National 9 area consisted of the small town of

Morrison, several smaller mountain communities and twenty-eight

isolated public telephone pay stations throughout this mountainous area.

It became necessary at this point to establish twenty-four hour

a day coverage at the local exchange so that supervisory telephone

company personnel could visually trace all local telephone calls to the

residence. The entire telephone exchange building was blacked out so that

no one would be aware that any activity was in progress within the

building.

Long distance calls to Morrison, land this included those from

Denver) were routed ouer thirteen long distance operator trunks and

through Direct Distance Dialing equipment at the toll section of the

Denuer tele phone building.

It was necessary that a means be found so that the supervisor

on duty at the exchange could be alerted of all calls going to the coors

residence telephone. This was accomplished by placing a "ringer" across

the coors telephone line. The "ringer" is merely a telephone bell

which rings in an identical manner to that of the bell on the telephone

at the coors residence. It has no effect on the telephone circuit.

When the "ringer rang, the supervisor on duty could determine

in a matter of seconds whether the call to the doors residence was

coming from a local National 9 telephone of whether it was an incoming

call by long distance.

- 3 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 199

---

## Page 200

If the call was being made from a local number within his own

exchange, he could visually trace the call within a matter of seconds

and determine from what local area telephone the call was being made.

If the call was coming by long distance from denuer, he could

immediately determine on which of the thirteen trunks from Denver the

call was coming in on.

This is the only tracing he could do.

Local calls were simple to trace. All equipment in the exchange

was contained in one small room.

Long distance calls were a different matter. The Morrison

supervisor needed to immediately notify the toll section at Denver so

that tracing operations from that point could be started.

CENTRAI CONTROL POINT

The tracing operation was controlled from the office of the

supervising service Foreman of the toll section at the Denver main

telephone building. This office and associated equipment occupy an

entire floor of the main telephone building. Doors to this space can

be opened only by authorized personnel through use of a coded dialing

system. It is a key facility.

The office was equipped with two toll tandem lines as well as

four local telephone lines. Denuer had not conuerted to Direct Distance

Dialing (DDD) at the time the coors case began, but the toll tandem

lines could do the same thing as DDD, only better. It might be well to

furnish a brief summary of DiD as this is necessary to explain how the

01l tandem operates and a toll tandem line is the key to the successful

operation

of a tracing system such as was used.

- 4=

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 200

---

## Page 201

With DDD,

to call the FBI in San Francisco from Denuer, it is

first necessary to dial 1l2. This serves to actuate the DDD equipment.

Then it is necessary to dial 415, which places the call into the san

Francisco main toll center equipment..

Then it is necessary to dial

Klondike 2-2155, the actual number of the san Francisco office.

As soon as this operation is completed, an operator comes on

the line to secure the number from which you are calling. This is for

billing purposes. As soon as she has done this, the call is put through

without any further action on the part of the calling party. (This is

Known as a CAMA operation, Customer Automatic Message Accounting.)

Some cities have a completely automatic system in which all

data necessary for billing purposes is punched on a tape and no operator.

breaks in to secure the number of the calling party. (This is known

as AlA operation, Automatic Message Accounting.)

The toll tandem cuts out one whole operation of DDD. To call

our san Francisco number, it is only necessary to pick up the tandem,

dial the area code of 415, plus the number of the san Francisco office.

No operator comes on the line to secure the number as no toll charge

is necessary. It's almost like making a local call, except for the

extra three digits. The toll tandem line is used almost exclusively

by supervisory toll personnel to talk to other supervisory toll

personnel in distant cities,

much as the ordinary individual dials

Jocal calls. This is truly an investigative aid, but to the telephone

company it is merely a means to secure instant communication to any

city in the United States. Only three toll tandem lines were available

in the telephone building, two in the toll tandem supervisor's office

→ 5 =

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 201

## Page 202

and the other in the office of the president of ll SI & t co.

From the toll tandem office, the central control point of the

tracing operation, (except for local Morrison, Colorado, calls within

the NAtional 9 exchange), it became necessary to devise a system of

rapid communication between Denuer and Morrison as all calls to Morrison

could appear at several different places in the main Denuer telephone

building.

Let us consider this communications problem:

When the Morrison exchange supervisor located a call coming to

the coors residence on one of the thirteen long distance trunks from

Denver, quick action had to be taken at the Denuer exchange to locate

the particular.call while the calling party was still on the line,

otherwise no trace could be made of the call.

The only available means of communication from Denuer to

Morrison was by way of one of the thirteen long distance lines, but

this wasn't fast enough. It meant lifting up a phone at Denver or

Morrison and calling the other by long distance. Only two phones were

available at the Morrison exchange and during the time a call was being

received at the coors residence, the supervisor was much too busy

trying to trace the call to stop and get on the telephone.

The answer was the installation of a continuously operating

telephone circuit between the Denuer toll office and the Morrison

exchange through use of one of the thirteen long distance lines.

At the Morrison exchange, a telephone handset was mounted

in the center of the equipment room.

At the Denuer toll office, a speaker telephone set was installed.

6 =

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 202

---

## Page 203

A speaker telephone is the type used by many executives to.

free their hands when making telephone calls. It consists of a small

speaker and a built-in

microphone so that the user of such a set can

talk in a normal tone of voice and anyone in the room can hear the

incoming conversation over the speaker. No handset is used.

Thus, when a call came to the coors residence over long distance

equipment from Denver, the supervisor on duty at Morrison immediately

determined on which of the thirteen long distance trunks the call was

coming from and shouted the number of the trunk into the speaker phone

system to alert the superuisor on duty at denver.

The supervisor at the Denuer toll office then had to take prompt

action to trace the call. His problem was magnified somewhat because

each long distance call to the coors residence could originate in one

of three ways and there was no way of telling which way was in use

until checks were made at various equipment centers within the telephone

building. It was a matter similar to locating a fire in a building when

you don't know on which floor the fire is burning.

Originating points were as follows:

1. Through a Denuer long distance operator. (IWO floOrs

of equipment and operators and an overload long distance

exchange located at an east Denuer exchange some five

miles away.)

2. Through terminal grade trunks from a number of cities in

Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico. (Located on one floor.)

3. Through Direct Distance Dialing equipment.

(Located adjacent to the toll tandem office.)

- -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 203

## Page 204

Each had

its

own separate problems.of tracing and each will

now be covered in some detail:

A. LONG DISTANCE OPERATOR CALLS

Telephone company craft employees were kept on duty twenty-four

hours a day in the equipment room at Denver where the thirteen trunks

from Morrison, Colorado,

originated. When a trace alert arrived from

Morrison to the toll tandem office, the craft employee was notified by

loud speaker to visually determine where a particular call was coming

from. For example, if he was notified that a call was coming in on

Trunk Y, the craft employee went to trunk y where he could determine

whether the call was coming from a denuer long distance operator or from

a long distance operator in some distant city. He would immediately

relay this information back to the toll tandem supervisor's office.

If the call originated from a Denuer long distance operator,

the toll supervisor would call the three denver Chief Operators, each

responsible for a unit of long distance operators. Each Chief Operator

would then unobtrusively walk down a line of long distance operators and

pick up all their long distance toll tickets, locate the one directed

to the coors residence and notify the toll supervisor where the call

was coming from as the originating telephone number appears on the

toll ticket.

It might be noted at this point that the picking up of toll

tickets by the Chief Operator is a normal procedure butthe timing in a

tracing operation is most important. Any lag would result in searching

through a greater number of toll tickets.

The Chief Operators were briefed as to what they were doing

but the many long distance operators were unoware that a tracing

=8 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 204

---

## Page 205

operation was in progress.

One small loophole existed in this system but it could not be

avoided other than by direct tracing of each call and this could not

be done in this case. Why? To make a direct trace, it is necessary

to "hold-up" or "slug" each circuit involved in the call, starting at the

called party and following it back to the originating point. This would

very likely alert the calling party because of the clicks which would

be heard on the line every time a "slug" was inserted into the switching

mechanism. It would mean having telephone company employees on duty

twenty-four hours a day at each telephone exchange in the city of

Denver and surrounding suburban areas. Each employee would have to be

able to communicate instantly with each other employee. A direct

trace can be made only from one exchange to the next and a call may go

through many exchanges. A "slug" must be inserted at each exchange

before you can go on to the next exchange. This takes time and man-

power of such magnitude that it is not feasible for any extended period

of time. The call can be traced only while the actual call is taking

place. As soon as the calling party hangs up, the trace

is lost

except to the points where the call has been "slugged."

The loophole mentioned was this: the calling party merely

had to give the long distance operator an incorrect number for the one

from which the call was actually being placed, but this in itself is

a risk for the calling party. An alert long distance operator can detect

that a wrong number is being given and will refuse to place the call

under such circumstances. she might not check a call coming from

Acoma 2-1234 if the calling party said he was calling from AComa 2-1235,

- 9 .

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 205

## Page 206

but if the calling party was.calling from BElmont 3-1234 and he said he

was calling from AComa 2-1234, he would not get away with it. Even in

the first example, the operator, if suspicious, could re-dial the

number AComa 2-1234 and if this line did not show a busy signal, the

ruse would not work. Even in the first example where a wrong number was

given, we would still have the city the call came from if long distance

and at least the approximate area if a local call. During the operation

of the tracing system, no incorrect numbers were noted and all were

traceable.

If the call originated from a distant city long distance

operator, the superuisor used the facilities of the toll tandem in

his office. He dialed the distant city Chief Operator, briefly

explained his problem, giving no more information than was necessary,

and asked the Chief Operator to collect all pending toll tickets and

locate the one directed to NAtional 9-4455 at Morrison, Colorado.

This is not an unusual procedure and the toll supervisor has a job

of such responsibility that a Chief Operator will not ordinarily

question his orders. In the few instances where a chief Operator in a

distant city hesitated, the denuer toll supervisor was prepared to

call his counterpart toll supervisor in the distant city. Usually,

the mere statement that he was prepared to make such a call or that

he would call the Chief Special Agent or a Traffic Superintendent

(the Chief Operator's boss) was enough to resolve the hesitation. The

cardinal principle here involved, is that a toll tandem supervisor

knows his way around,

knows telephone company parlance and operating

procedure. Is he can't get the job done one way, he knows who to

-10 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 206

---

## Page 207

contact to get the job done. As a result, no failures were involved

in obtaining the pertinent toll ticket in a minimum of time.

B.

CALLS THROUGH TERMINAL GRADE TRUNKS

A terminal grade trunk is one by which a long distance operator

in a distant city can dial a number in the same manner as a long

distance operator located in Denuer. Thus, for example, a long distance

operator in Cheyenne, Wyoming, could plug into a Denuer terminal grade

trunk and place a call to borrison, colorado, in the some manner as a

Denver long distance operator. It is just an extension off the Denuer

Jong distance board, although it covers a lot of miles. This did not

create much of a problem as the craft employee soon recognized that a

terminal grade trunk was being used and he notified the toll tandem

supervisor who then placed a call to the Chief Operator in the distant

city and the same procedure was followed as outlined above.

C. DIRECT DISTANCE DIALING (DDD) EQUIPMENT

When the Coors case occurred, Denuer was not equipped to

handle DDD calls but all the equipment for this method of dialing was

installed in the toll office and the system of tracing calls which

went through this equipment was developed by the supervising service

Foreman of the toll section and several of his toll supervisors. As

will be recalled, the supervising service Foreman of the toll section

attended the original meeting of telephone company officials.

He returned to his office late in the afternoon, held over

several of his toll supervisors, and they all went to work on the problem.

By 3:00 A.lo, the system was completed, tested and placed into

operation. The ingenuity of this operation cannot be over-emphasized

-11 -

## Page 208

• *

as it eventually saved countless hours of manpower and alerted toll

personnel in Denver that a call was proceeding to the coors residence

even before the coors telephone rang.

Tracing became an instantaneous operation.

The technical aspects of this system are much too extensive

for review at this point, but in layman's language the following took

place:

The DDD equipment in Denuer is described as a 4A Crossbar System.

The crossbar switching system was developed by Western Electric and the

Bell Telephone laboratories after years of research, but even when it

was being installed a few years ago, it was obsolete because of newer

advancements in the electronic field.

Each crossbar office is equipped with a machine known as a

Trouble Recorder. This machine helps the crossbar system to locate

all mechanical and electrical malfunctions in the entire system.

If a trouble condition develops in one particular circuit,

the crossbar system tries to route the call through another circuit,

and in most instances succeeds.

As soon as any malfunction occurs, the trouble recorder ejects

a punched card and an alarm bell rings. A trained craft employee needs

only to glance at the punched card to determine that a particular circuit

is not functioning properly and immediately proceed to make the necessary

repairs.

Any large toll office prides itself in keeping the crossbar

equipment operating in a most efficient manner. In fact, each trouble

card ejected outs down their "Index" which to them is what statistics

are to the Bureau.

- 12 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 208

---

## Page 209

The tracing system developed used the trouble recorder machine

to trace the incoming calls. Every time a call went to the coors

residence or to eight other adjacent numbers, a trouble card was ejected.

This card would show the routing of the incoming call and a tracing

operating could be started even before the coors telephone rang.

The cara was ejected because a trouble condition "trap" showing

a continuity failure was placed on the first attempt to ring the coors

telephone. This is known as a "first trial failure."

But remember, when a failure occurs, the crossbar system

doesn't give up but makes a second trial attempting to place the call

by a different circuit. The "trap" was so set up that on the second

trial, the call to the coors residence was completed. The important

thing was that the essential routing instructions for a tracing

operation were punched into the trouble recorder card which had been

ejected on the first trial.

The time lapse between "trials" is not great. It takes from

500 to 750 milliseconds to make the second trial so there is no

observable delay in the call. Note, houever, that from the crossbar

equipment the incoming call to the coors residence had to go through

the step-by-step equipment at Morrison, Colorado. Since it takes a

call approximately ten seconds to go through the step-by-step

equipment, we got a ten second running start on the tracing operation.

As to actual procedure, as soon as the trouble card dropped

in the crossbar equipment room, a craft employee determined the

routing instructions from which he could determine from what distant

city the call was being originated. He called the toll tandem

supervisor by inter.com. The supervisor placed a call to the Chief

-13 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 209

---

## Page 210

Operator of the distant city and asked her to pick up the pertinent

•toll ticket. On almost all occasions, the calling number was known

before we knew whether the call was worthy of tracing or not.

As time went on, the trouble cards being dropped for our

operation began to cut

into the "Index" of the toll section to such

an extent that permission was granted by officials of the company to

discount all the cards caused by our tracing activities.

As a matter of evidentiary nature, each trouble card was

filed away for future reference. Craft employees marked each card with

the time, date and their initials as well as the routing information.

A log was maintained in the toll tandem supervisor's office

by the toll supervisors, marking down the date, time, routing information,

results of the trace and the fact that a discontinuance of the trace

was received.

These logs and cards assumed some importance later in the coors

case when the SAc noted that a call had been received from Atlantic City

during the early stages of the tracing operation at a time prior to the

discovery of Corbett's car near Atlantic City. Through quick checking

of the logs and cards, it was determined that this call had been placed

by a college friend of urs. Coors.

MODIFICATIONS MADE IN THE TRACING SYSTEM AS TIME PROGRESSED

As time went on, officials of the telephone company became

somewhat alarmed at the added expense to them of continuing the

tracing operation.

Toll supervisors were on duty twenty-four hours a day, seven

days a week. Under ordinary conditions, these supervisors were not on

- 14 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 210

---

## Page 211

duty during weekends, except when major trouble occurred or when

extensive revamping of the system was required. Additionally, these

superuisors are

usually out inspecting equipment and directing the work

of the craft employees in the eguipment room. since one of the super-

visors had to remain in the toll tandem supervisor's office at all

times to handle the tracing operation, it cut down on his normal

supervisory duties.

To alleviate this situation, a special Agent of the telephone

company was assigned to handle the tracing operation during the day. If

any particular problem arose, one of the toll supervisors was not too

jar away.

A sound trained FBI agent was on duty from 1:00 P.M. until the

next morning. After familiarizing himself with the operation he was

able to handle the tracing operation during the occasional absences of

the toll supervisor. Week-end duty was handled on a voluntary basis

by the individual toll supervisors and all volunteered. Since they were

paid on a yearly salary basis, no overtime or premium pay was involved

insojar as the telephone company was concerned.

The big problem arose in justifying the use of a craft employee

in the equipment room twenty-four hours a day. His sole duty was to

determine on which Denver dorrison trunk a particular call was on. He

could do nothing else. His entire salary had no return to the telephone

company. Further, as a craft employee, he was entitled to premium pay

for working nights, special shifts and on weekends.

With the success of the tracing operation through use of the

trouble recorder system, a way was found to eliminate the craft

employee. Hecall that all calls through the crossbar system were

• 15 .

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 211

---

## Page 212

automatically traced through use of the trouble recorder card. Graft

employees were on duty twenty-four hours a day at the trouble recorder,

irrespective of our operation.

If all calls could somehow be routed through the crossbar system,

the craft employee making checks on the long distance operator calls and

the terminal grade operator call, could be eliminated. This was done.

Each long distance operator in Denuer had access to the thirteen

trunks to Morrison, Colorado by which she could dial a National 9 number

by plugging into an unused Morrison circuit and dialing the number

involved. This she did as a creature of habit when she had a call going

to Morrison.

She could just as easily plug into a crossbar circuit and place

her call through the crossbar system. So, the District Iraffic Superin

tendent authorized the "blacking out" of all these Morrison operator

trunk outlets. This became a matter of disabling each of these operating

circuits at each long distance operator position by removing the sleeve

from each circuit and placing plugs in the associated holes on the long

distance board. Each long distance operator was then instructed to

place her Morrison calls through the crossbar circuits.

This left the terminal grade trunks of which there were 170

scattered throughout the Rocky Mountain area. The terminal grade

trunks were the property of the long lines department of the American

Telephone and Telegraph Company and were a revenue making proposition

ОТАР&Ї АI&ЇСО.,

but not necessarily for Mountain States. The terminal

grade trunks would be made inoperative anyuay as soon as Mountain States

changed over to DDD on April 23, 1960. The district Iraffic super-

intendent authorized the "turning down," or placing out of service,

-16 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 212

---

## Page 213

all the terminal grade trunks. This took a few days to accomplish, but

the end result was that all calls to Morrison, and coincidentally to

the coors residence, were all routed through the crossbar system where

an automatic trace was available.

Irom that time on, the tracing system could be kept up

indefinitely without a great monetary loss to the telephone company

and it was so continued until March 14, 1960.

COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SAC OF THE SPECIAL

When the special squad was being orgonized, it became evident

that the telephone facilities of the Denuer Office would be taxed to

the utmost.

The criminal squad room of the Denver Office was vacated for

she special squad. The SAd's office was placed in the adjacent criminal

supervisor's office.

A call was placed to the IS I d I Co. Denver Metropolitan

equipment supervisor, a long time contact of the Denver Office. He

immediately proceeded to the Denver Office with a crew of installers

to design an expanded telephone system for the office.

The criminal supervisor's office had a two button telephone

set with two incoming lines. Each of these lines was brought out to

another two button telephone set so that the ASAC of the special could

listen to each call if necessary.

An additional telephone with a direct outside unlisted number

was installed so the SAl could make direct outside calls without going

through the office switchboard. Another telephone was installed for

the SAd's secretary.

-17 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 213

---

## Page 214

A way had to be found to arrange instantaneous telephone

communication with the coors residence. This is where the Denuer

Metropolitan Equipment supervisor's knowledge of telephone circuitry

oame to the fore.

Thirteen telephone circuits existed from Denver to Morrison.

One of these circuits was being used full time for the Inter-com system

between the Morrison telephone exchange and the denuer toll office.

None of the other lines could be released for our use as they were

all needed for long distance traffic.

To call the coors residence from the Denver FBI Office it

was necessary to dial the operator, as on a regular long distance call

and delays occurred on every call.

The equipment supervisor recalled that a wealthy Denver

manufacturer had a summer home in the mountains, served by a leased

long distance line from Denver through which his mountain mansion

could be dialed directly from Denuer.

The line was not in use during the winter months but because

of the owner's stature in the community, the line was never used for

any other purpose. The equipment supervisor promptly "borrowed" this

line and had it looped into the Morrison exchange thereby giving us

the direct long distance line from denuer to morrison via the

mountain mansion.

Then our equipment supervisor borrowed a technique which is

not used very frequently in telephone installations. It resembles

the old hand-cranked country telephone set in a sense except you don't

need the hand crank. He installed a "ring-down" phone in the SAC's

-18 =

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 214

---

## Page 215

office and a companion "ring-down" phone in the coors residence at

Morrison.

To communicate, all that was necessary was to lift up either

phone and the one on the other end of the line rang.

To complete the communications picture, there were four incoming

lines to the toll tandem supervisor's office, all dialable from Denver.

So, we can now follow the action as it took place every time

an incoming call arrived at the coors residence in Morrison:

As soon as the phone rang, the special Agent on duty at the

Coors residence was alerted to listen to his Magnecorder and record

the incoming conversation. If he could determine that the call was

legitimate and not worthy of tracing, he would lift up his "ring-down"

phone and aduise the sAc the trace was not necessary. The sAc would

then dial one of the numbers of the toll tandem office and aduise the

agent or the telephone company employee on duty that it was not

necessary to trace the particular call in progress.

To prevent any delay in case all the lines to the toll tandem

office were busy (and this happened on occasion) a dispatcher radio

unit was installed in the toll tandem office so that the tracing operation

could be discontinued by calling on the Denver EM radio system using

suitable pretext language.

This dispatcher unit was also used to communicate with Bureau

radio cars during the period of time when a number of pay telephone

locations were being covered in the Denuer area.

A dispatcher unit was also installed at the Coors residence

at Morrison in the event of a breakdown of telephone circuits.

SPECIALIZED COVERAGE:

PAY STATIONS IN THE NATIONAL 9 AREA

Early in the case it was obvious that a call could be placed

to the Coors

residence from any one of a number of pay telephones

located in the National 9 exchange without going through an operator.

By checking telephone company records, it was found that

twenty-eight pay telephones existed in the National 9 exchange. Many

were located outside and some in very isolated places. These ranged,

according to telephone company records, from such places as:

"Inside booth at labor Bar, Main Street, Morrison, Colorado";

"Outside booth, inter-Canyon Fire Department, mounted

on telephone pole number 649, about three miles above

Tiny Town at lender Junction, where you turn off to

Phillipsburg, Colorado";

"Outside booth, IS I & I CO. ball park, Morrison

Road,

east edge of town about where you cross to go

to soda Lake, on Pole number 9-26."

A team of Agents visually obserued each of these locations

through use of a telephone company truck and all locations were

pinpointed on a map in the Denver Office.

In addition, supervisors at the Morrison exchange marked

each of these telephone terminals for quick reference in the event

that a call was received from one of the booths.

MULTIPLE PAY STATIONS IN DENVER AREA

Recognizing that a call might be made from a crowded area in

Denver through a pay telephone, a survey was made of all locations in

- 20 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 216

---

## Page 217

Denver where three or more pay stations existed. This was accomplished

through review of telephone company records.

seventeen locations were found where multiple pay stations

existed. For instance, the Denver Union Station had a total of twenty-

eight pay stations located in three different banks of booths.

Stapleton Air Field, the main Denver airport, had twenty-three

pay telephones located in four different banks of booths.

DENVER TOLL TICKET SURVEY

Since the subject of the case might place a call to the coors

residence to give instructions for a payoff, and then place a long

distance: call to the Location where the victim was being held, all toll

tickets on long distance calls made from Denver, Colorado and some

suburban areas were photographed through use of a Recordak machine set

up in the main telephone company building.

Two agents were busy handling this operation as approximately

600, 000 toll tickets were photographed from February 13, 1960 through

March 1, 1960.

Toll tickets were picked up on a regular basis and processed

through the Recordak machine so that no delay would occur in trans-

ferring the toll tickets to the telephone company's accounting center

in Denver where the tickets are sorted for billing purposes.

It is well to note here that unless the toll tickets are

photographed immediately before the accounting breakdown is made, the

tickets are sent to all parts of the country for billing purposes and

they are effectively lost forever insofar as obtaining data which

might later be of interest to the investigation.

- 21

## Page 218

CRANK CALLS

several crank calls were made to the coors residence during the

tracing operation period. We were successful in tracing these calls.

The Chies Special Agent's Office was particularly helpful in these

instances in furnishing us with long distance toll tickets placed by

the persons who made the crank calls.

Crank calls were made to the Victim's father's home in Golden,.

Colorado, where the Coors Brewery is located. These calls were usually

of short duration.

In one instance, the caller stated he would call Inter the same

evening. The telephone company Chief Special Agent, a supervising

service foreman and an FBI Agent attempted to make a direct trace when

the incoming call came in. The call was traced back to a telephone

exchange in west Denver, but the call was of such short duration that

it "fell-ogg" before the trace could be completed. We did know that

the call was coming from a pay telephone in West Denver on a particular

street and with sufficient manpower on the street, the caller probably

could haue been identified.

How do you say thanks to all the telephone company employees,

many of whom gave up their week ends to assist in covering this

essential operation?

While the sound trained agent working with telephone company

personnel is able to verbally express the appreciation of the whole

office and of the Bureau, letters of appreciation from the Director

are most effective.

Anyone visiting the denuer toll tandem office today will notice

- 22 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 218

## Page 219

a framed letter from the Director, addressed personally to the

Supervising Service Foreman commending him and individually mentioning

the names oj

each foreman under his supervision who so ably assisted the

Bureau.

A visit to the oifice of the Chief special Agent will reveal

a framed photograph of the Director addressed to him personally.

The above two are examples of ways in which the Bureau's

gratitude was expressed. Other such letters were directed to key

personnel of uS T&T Co., including the President. You can be

assured that these expressions of gratitude are treasured long after

the remembrance of sacrificed week ends have faded away.

The question now arises, if a similar situation arose today,

could the same job be done with DDD equipment?

According to our now firmly established sources, it can be

done, but each future case will have its own individual problems.

The answer can be given by the telephone company personnel involued

when the specific problem is advanced.

The best aduice that can be given is to locate the proper

• Key personnel, particularly those

responsible for the operation of the

toll tandem office, set out the problem involved and let them arrive

(A) CRIMINAL INFORMANTS-CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM - SAC Letters

57-70 dated December 13, 1957, 58-64 dated October 14, 1958, 59-48

dated August 4, 1959, and 61-13 dated March 14, 1961, pointed out the

urgent need for criminal informants who can give direct information

relative to individuals under investigation in connection with the

Criminal Intelligence Program.

An analysis of available information developed to date

concerning the structure of organized crime in this country reveals

a decided need for the further clarification and expansion of facts

now known concerning the identity of the leaders of the organized

hoodlum element, and the manner in which this element functions.

To successfully complete our intelligence picture of the controlling

forces which make organized crime operative, it is now urgently

necessary to develop particularly qualified, live sources within

the upper echelon of the organized hoodlum element who will be

capable of furnishing the quality information required.

The most significant information developed to date indicating

organization among the nation's hoodlum leaders has been obtained from

highly confidential sources in Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia

concerning the existence of a

of top leaders of the

organized hoodlum element exerting a controlling influence on racket

activities in this country. Additional information concerning the

"commission" has also been developed recently from a highly confidential

source in Newark.

The Chicago and New York sources have discussed the

"commission" as

being composed variously of six, nine, and twelve

members.

The Chicago

source accounts for a nine- or twelve-man

commission by discussing increases in

"commission" membership resulting

In expansion of this group to either nine or twelve men. Both the

Chicago and New York sources list as members Vito Genovese, Thomas

Luchese, Joseph Profaci, Carlo Gambino and Joseph Bonanno.

The Chicago

source indicates Samuel

Glancana is a member, with the New York source

furnishing information that there is a

"commission" member from Chicago

without naming him.

Genovese, Luchese, Profaci and Gambino are all

Top Hoodlums from the New York area.

Giancana is a Chicago Top Hoodlum;

Bonanno is a Phoenix Top Hoodlum residing in Tucson, and formerly from

Brooklyn, New York.

In addition, the Chicago source names hoodlums believed

Identical with Joseph

Zer1ll1, Detroit Top Hoodlum; John La Rocca,

Pittsburgh Top Hoodlum; Raymond Patriarca, Boston Iop Hoodlum; and

Steve Magaddino, Buffalo Iop Hoodlum as "

commission" members.

The

Chicago source

suggests that Joseph Ida, Newark Top Hoodlum who has

returned to Sicily, was a "commission" member representing the

Philadelphia area.

The Philadelphia source identifies Angelo

as the current representative

of the

This source also discusses Bruno

traveling to New York to receive

instructions from the "commission."

Information recently received from a highly confidential source in

Newark indicates that Gerardo Catena, Newark Top Hoodlum, has been

placed on the "commission" in the recent past.

The New York source identifies Carlo Gambino as the

current chairman of the "commission," indicating that he is occupying

this position in place of Vito Genovese, while Genovese is in prison.

The Chicago source previously indicated that Genovese appeared to

occupy the top position prior to his incarceration. The New York

and Chicago sources have mentioned Albert Anastasia, deceased New

York hoodlum, as a former "commission"

member, and

the New York

source has identified Frank Costello, New York Top Hoodlum currently

in Federal Prison, as a former "commission"

member prior to his loss

of favor as an underworld power.

Both the Chicago and New York sources have used the term

"avugat" to denote a "commission" member; "avugat" is a shortened

version of the full Italian word "avvocato" which, literally

translated, means

"attorney."

Enlarging upon the "commission's" power and influence

regarding organized criminal activities throughout the country, the

New York source explained that there were two hoodlum leaders,

referred to as the "boss" and the "underboss," in each major

popu-

lation area throughout the country and in Canada, who are responsible

to the

"commission" for activities in their respective areas. In

explaining this progression of authority, the source cited as an

example the mob leadership in the Philadelphia area in years

past. "

In the period referred to, Joseph Ida

leaders answerable to Albert Anastasia,

member at that time.

Other examples of

"bosses" identified by this

source were Santo Trafficante in Florida and Joseph Civello in Texas.

Trafficante is a Tampa Top Hoodlum and Civello, a Dallas Top Hoodlum.

• According to this source these local leaders, the "bosses" and

"underbosses," operate to a degree on their own, making their own

decisions in underworld matters involving activities in their own

areas. However, they are ultimately answerable to the "commission"

in case of problems or disputes, with the "commission" functioning

as an arbitration board.

Ine chicago, New York, and thiladelphia sources strongly

suggest that the "commission" either appoints pos at least has

final approval over the appointment of local

The Chicago source discussed Vito Genovese traveling

about the country in connection with a number of "promotions"

within

the organization, and mentioned frequent changes of the

source furnished corresponding information

concerning a change in

This information, made possible through the establishment

of these sources, has been invaluable in providing insight into the

out above,

there is an urgent need for amplifying information which

will reveal full details concerning the operations of these inter-

related organized criminal groups throughout the nation..

Our urgent need for new live sources strategically placed

reported by any live criminal source to date. This, of course,

suggests a problem of some delicacy in seeking information from

live informants, since we must avoid the danger of informants

"playing back" information they may obtain through questions asked

them.

You are again reminded that the penetration and infiltration)

of organized criminal activity is a prime objective of the bureau,

and to accomplish this it is necessary to give a renewed impetus to

the development of quality criminal informants.

We have learned through our experience in conducting

investigations in connection with the Criminal Intelligence Program

that the best source we could possibly obtain would be a criminal

informant who is highly placed in organized crime.

The Bureau is therefore inaugurating the following program

in an effort to develop criminal informants of

the type mentioned

above.

Effective immediately the following offices must designate

a squad of Special Agents to work exclusively on the development of

criminal informants who are in a position to furnish valuable

information regarding cases currently under investigation in

connection with this program, and to furnish quality criminal

intelligence information: Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Las Vegas,

Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and

San Francisco.

The selection of Agent personnel to participate in this

program is of vital importance.

The Agents selected must have

demonstrated in the past their ability in this field and shoula

be mature, aggressive, resourceful, and possess the necessary

knowledge

of criminal

activities in your area to intelligently

accomplish the objectives.

In addition to the above qualities an enthusiastic approach

to this program is a basic essential which must be evidenced by all

Agents whom you designate to participate.

Io insure the success of this program, It is necessary to

utilize Special Agents with the will and desire to employ new

approaches and means to secure the Bureau's goals.

It is your personal responsibility to select the Special

Agents to participate in

the program and to advise the Bureau within

one week of their names.

SELECTION OF POTENTIAL INFORMANTS

These are cited only as examples of the types of individuals

who would be in a position to furnish the information required. You

are undoubtedly aware of other hoodlums, who for various reasons may

be susceptible to an approach.

The eleven offices participating in this program should

submit to the Bureau within one week the identities of hoodlums you

have selected for concentrated attention. Each office, with the

exception of the New York Office, should submit a minimum of five

names; the New York Office 1s to

submit a minimum of ten names.

SUGGESTED APPROACHES

To properly develop informants of this caliber, varied

approaches can and should be utilized, dependent upon the individual

under development. The following methods are being set forth as

possible guidelines.

Background Investigation

A penetrative investigation of each individual selected

as a target for development as an informant should be conducted

prior to any approach of the individual.

In many instances this information will be available to

your office as a result of previous investigations.

Do not overlook

possibilities of obtaining additional information from your criminal

informants and sources.

Through these investigations you should determine back-

ground, marital status, girl friends, hobbies, personalities,

relatives, financial affairs, criminal record, current criminal

activities, et cetera of each individual selected for development.

Be alert to the possibility of utilizing as informants,

Individuals currently incarcerated

who were formerly associates

of top Hoodlums

families could induce their cooperation.

The offer of assistance to these individuals'

A review of all these facts should assist materially

in planning the development period.

Payments

The Bureau will authorize substantial remuneration for

informants who can provide information concerning hoodlums who

have national stature. Payments in this instance will be made

for quality criminal intelligence information and you will not

be restricted in making payments to just those instances which

involve a substantive violation over which the Bureau has

jurisdiction.

It is apparent that hope for financial reward will not

.be a motivating force which would induce most selected targets for

development to cooperate; however, under certain circumstances

this .could be a most effective means and should not be overlooked.

Compromising Situations

It is imperative that full exploitation be made of

circumstances which place a potential informant in a position

where it would be advantageous to him to furnish information to

the Bureau.

a. Prosecution

Awareness of an individual under development that he

is liable to either Federal or State prosecution could be a

compelling reason for such an individual to cooperate with the

Bureau.

b. Deportation

Fear of deportation is a fact that could motivate many

of the selected targets for development to be susceptible to

development as informants. This may well be one of the effective

approaches which could be used against older top echelon hoodlums.

Some examples

bear or pressure being exerted Irom associates or rivals in organized

criminal activity.

Confidential Basis

It should be made crystal clear to the individuals under

development in connection with this program that any information

furnished by them will be handled on a strictly confidential basis.

You should insure that no dissemination is made of information

obtained from such sources unless the informant can be fully protected.

In the implementation of this program, the Bureau's objective of

penetration and infiltration of the top echelon of organized criminal

activities and the continuous flow of quality criminal intelligence

information should be constantly kept in mind.

This

program presents a definite new challenge to the field

which to be met calls for new and untried methods and situations may

arise which will be evaluated by the Bureau based upon the realization

of the need for unusual and extreme methods. The offices participating

in this program must of necessity display the initiative and ingenuity

to provide the impetus to realize the Bureau's objective.

Every office is being advised of this program since in the

future It may be appropriate to expand it to include additional

offices.

All offices instructed to designate a squad of

Special

Agents to participate in this program should advise the Bureau

within thirty days of the progress made.

The Bureau will analyze

• the preliminary information

obtained and within a three months' period, a conference at

either Seat of Government or in the field will be held to evaluate

the progress made and to redirect the program as a result of the

experience gained to date.

These special assignments will not eliminate the

responsibilities of all Special Agents to fully participate in

the criminal informant program.

(A) ' INCENTIVE AWARDS - FBI' FORM BOOK -- The Civil Service Commission

has revised the Incentive Awards Program regulations as they relate

primarily to awards for suggestions or contributions where tangible

savings are involved.

The table for determining the amount of

such

awards has been changed to (1) increase the minimum award from

$10 to $15, (2) provide for $50 minimum tangible benefit to qualify

• for an award and

(3) increase the amount of award where more sub-

stantial savings are realized.

The changes have little effect on

awards involving intangible benefits resulting from employee contri-

butions and

benefits unless

• the employee's contribution compares favorably

with minimum awards granted where tangible benefits are involved.

Suggestions which deal with maintenance or repair, items

of supply which could be procured through simple requisition, or

offer no specific means to improve operations cannot be considered

suggestions within the limits of the program.

Similarly, ideas to

improve working conditions which could and should have been cor-

rected in the normal course of work and proposals which are trivial

in nature or which would cost more to process than any saving they

could achieve, will not be evaluated under the suggestion program

but will be returned to the appropriate supervisor for oral

the potential adverse impact upon the criminal proceeding should

there be an untimely release or inspection of the statements in

question. "

For the purposes of this rule, a case will be considered

as formally referred to the United States Attorney when facts are

presented to him and he indicates the likelihood of ultimate

prosecution.

Requests made prior to formal referral for copies of

signed statements and confessions will be honored as in the past.

The NOI Is an all-Negro organization which was

originally organized in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan.

claims to have been selected by Allah,

the Supreme Beings to

lead the so-called Negro race out of

slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an independent black nation in

thing as a Negro; that the

so-called Negroes are slaves or the

white race, referred to as "white devils," in the United States;

and that the white race, because of its exploitation of the

so-called Negroes,

and will be destroyed in the approaching

"War of Armageadon."

In the past, officials and members of the Not, in-

cluding Muhammad, have refused to register under the provisions

of the Selective

Service Acts and have declared that members

owe no allegiance to the United States.

On May 5, 1958, the first source advised Muhammad had,

upon advice of legal counsel, tempered his personal statements

and instructions to his ministers concerning the principles of

his organization in order to avoid possible prosecution by the

Uniteù States Government; however, he did nut indicate any

fundamental changes in the teachings of his organization.

On May 17, 1961, a third source advised:

Muhammad

had, early in July, 1958, decided to de-emphasize the religious

aspects of the teachings of Islam and to stress the economic

benefits to be derived by those Negroes who joined the NOI.

This policy change, according to Muhammad, would help him

Individuals or organizations choose to use their training and

Therefore, you are instructed to immediately review the

security procedures

involving telephone lines used by your

office to insure that maximum security is maintained.

There is a present requirement that field office

telephone lines be checked quarterly and resident agency lines

annually. These security checks should not be performed on

such a highly regular basis that a pattern is established as to

the time they are conducted. As you are aware, these checks

are a precautionary measure

and cannot guarantee absolute

security of office and resident agency lines. Since these checks

guarantee security only at the time they are performed, personnel

should be most circumspect as to the nature of their conversation

over outside telephone lines. •

It is noted that a security check of telephone lines

requires a review of confidential telephone company records and

physical observation of the Bureau telephone lines located with

the telephone company central office (a space accessible only

to telephone company employees), and it is necessary to have

cooperation of the telephone company officials and craftsmen.

Careful consideration, therefore, should be given to the attitude

and background, particularly regarding security, racial and

criminal matters, of local telephone company employees contacted

(E) USE OF IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE INTERPRETERS --

In an effort to improve existing interpreting facilities avail-

able to the field,

the Bureau has discussed with Immigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) headquarters the number and

type of interpreters used by INS and whether or not its inter-

preters could periodically be used by the Bureau. INS has

available throughout the field, principally in larger cities,

a small staff of interpreters who are full-time employees of

INS.

Additionally, each local INS office maintains a roster of private

Individuals who can be used by INs on a contract basis in emergency

situations. The latter individuals are paid when necessary on an

hourly basis. No investigation of the latter group is conducted

although, in some instances, INS makes a national agency check

If repeated use of a particular individual is contemplated.

INS

has no objection to the Bureau's use of either its employees or

the nonemployee type, pointing out that, where employees are

involved, arrangements could be worked out on a local level and,

in the nonemployee type, the INS local office will provide the

identities of specific individuals capable of handling inter-

preting work and the Bureau could make its own arrangements

regarding the use of these individuals. To implement its

offer of

assistance in this regard, INS is sending appropriate

instructions to each INS field office.

As initially indicated, INS interpreting assistance,

as well as that available locally through other intelligence

agencies of the Government, previously approved, is to be usec

only when Bureau personnel

qualified to handle

interpreting

work or already established Bureau sources utilized as

Interpreters are not available or the expense of securing

one from another Bureau field division cannot be justified

by the routine nature of the particular interview involved.

Further, you are aware that outside interpreting assistance

is sought and utilized only in routine, nonsensitive,

exploratory interviews and, in these instances, if unresolved

questions develop or the individual being interviewed begins

to produce sensitive data, the preliminary interview should

gracefully terminated and steps taken to conduct a reinter-

view with qualified Bureau interpreting personnel.

In substance, therefore, if a need arises in your

office for an interpreter in a routine, nonsensitive investi-

gative matter and no previously established interpreting source

is readily available, you may consult the nearest local office

of INS and determine

if the desired interpreting assistance

can be provided. If the individual recommended by INS is not

an employee, his name should be checked through field office

indices, through local informants and established sources,

and criminal checks made and Bureau indices checked.

If financial reimbursement to this individual will be required,

Bureau approval must be obtained. Once you have established

a satisfactory relationship with an individual interpreter

in this category, no further contact with INS concerning his

value of this step, each office should maintain statistica

data showing the number of times INS employee-interpreters

are utilized by your office, the language involved, the number

of hours they expend on behalf of the Bureau, the

number of

interviews they participate in and

any unusual or exceptional

services performed. No statistical data is necessary concerning

the nonemployee type. A letter containing requested

statistical

data covering the last six months of 1961 should be submitted

to the Bureau by January 15, 1962. A second letter covering the

first six months of 1962 should be submitted by July 15, 1962.

COMMUNICATIONS - MESSAGE PRIORITIES - ENCODED MESSAGES - DiS-

cretion, common sense

and good judgment should be used in assigning

the priority "Urgent" to teletype and radio messages.

Assigning an

"Urgent"

priority to a message which does not require immediate

action serves only to delay the handling of messages which are

actually of an urgent and important nature and require immediate

action.

The sending of a nonurgent matter in encoded form with

an "Urgent" priority is a serious mistake in judgment, especially

if it is sent when skeleton shifts are on duty after regular hours

or on weekends. Encoded communications cannot be read, evaluated,

or their real urgency determined until they are actually decoded.

The receipt at any office of a nonurgent communication in encoded

form bearing an "Urgent"

priority may delay the decoding and delivery

to officials and supervisors of an urgent and important communication

received at the same time.

Lengthy encoded communications should not be sent to the

Bureau or to a field office on Friday concerning matters requiring

no action until the following Monday.

Matters of this nature should

be transmitted by airtel, using airmail and special delivery where

appropriate.

(B) ILLUSTRATED BROCHURE ("VISUAL. PRESENTATIONS") - COOPERATIVE

FUNCTIONS OF EXHIBITS SECTION -- Re SAC Letter Number 60-43 (E),

September 13, 1960.

Requests for visual aids have moderately increased as a

result of the dissemination of captioned brochure; however,

requests

for investigative and prosecutive aids are not widely distributed,

Indicating a need for all field divisions to be continually alert

to the value of utilizing the specialized services available through

the Exhibits Section. For example, approximately fifteen divisions

regularly request the preparation of artists' conceptions of unknown

subjects, charts and diagrams for antitrust and price-fixing investi-

gations,

scale drawings f'or use in Federal Tort Claims Act cases,

three-dimensional scale models in criminal prosecutions, et cetera.

A copy of this brochure is now being made available

to each United States Attorney in attendance at the United

States Attorneys' Conferences in Washington, D. C. It is to

be noted that the requirement of obtaining prior Bureau approval

for discussing possible services of the Exhibits Section with

United States Attorneys has been removed from all brochures

(last paragraph, page III) furnished to the United States Attorneys.

Requests for the preparation of demonstrative evidence should be

brought to the Bureau's attention whenever the United States

Attorney is of the opinion that visual aids are required in the

prosecution of those cases

wherein the FBI has primary Investigative

jurisdiction.

In the interest of assisting-law enforcement agencies

to fully realize the advantages of utilizing visual aids in

connection with investigative and prosecutive matters, it is

desired that your office will, when the occasion arises, exhibit

the brochure and discuss with police officials the extent to which

the Bureau has developed the use of trial exhibits in bringing

cases of national importance to satisfactory conclusions. Due to

the limited staff of specialized technicians maintained to prepare

trial exhibits in Federal violations, the services of the Bureau's

Exhibits Section cannot be honored in cases where the FBI is

without jurisdiction.

In the event police officials indicate an interest in

obtaining a copy of this brochure, the Bureau should be advised

of your recommendation.

(D) REPORT WRITING = STREAMLINING - SECURITY REPORTS --

Reference

•.1s made to SAC Letter Number 61-31 (J) dated June 6, 1961.

Referenced SAC Letter authorized the utilization of:

narrative-type statements in security reports. It was pointed

out that this particular type reporting was susceptible to use

primarily in cases of extensive activity in subversive organizations.

A review of reports submitted subsequent to referenced

SAC Letter reveals that attempts are being made to utilize narrative-

type reporting in cases in which little subversive activity

has

occurred. In such instances the reports must be detailed in order

to present as complete a picture as

possible of the subject's

activities in order that a proper determination may be made with

respect to his Security Index status.

Instances have been noted of attempts to weave into one

narrative statement information received from more than one source.

This practice

is contrary to the instructions contained in referenced

SAC Letter.

In reporting that a subject has attended meetings of a

particular organization during a certain period of time, the number

of meetings must be specified.

When reporting a subject's attendance at a specific

BEL

affair, set forth not only the date of the activity

statement to report a subject's activities, you must specify the

period of time covered. Following identification of the source to

which the information in the narrative statement is attributed,

specify inclusive dates of the Informant reports; for example, T-1

(July 1, 1960, to June 15, 1961).

I want to again stress the necessity for reporting in

detail all Information tending to establish a person's knowledge

of the basic aims and purposes of the subversive organization with

which affiliated, as well as all information tending to establish

that a subject 'holds revolutionary and/or anarchist beliefs.

PASHINGION 25, D. G.

A decline in the number of suggestions

submitted under the FBI Suggestion Program was experienced during

fiscal year 1961 when 700 suggestions were submitted in comparison

to 1870 during fiscal year 1960. Of the latter total 910 were sub-

mitted to the Suggestions Desk, while 960 were handled by the various

employees' streamlining committees. SAC Letter 60-45 (G) dated 9/27/60

instructed that all suggestions were to be submitted directly to me

without consideration or recommendation by streamlining committees.

However, even limiting consideration to the 910 suggestions handled

by the Suggestions Desk in fiscal year 1960, there was still a decrease

of 210 suggestions in fiscal year 1961. In addition the percentage

of adoptions decreased from 35.60% to 31.4% and awards and estimated

savings from $900 to $641 and $78,000.73 to $22,204.07 respectively.

(C) TRAVEL CONTROLS - CUBA -- Section 8TD, page 33, Manual of

Instructions, details the procedure to be followed concerning foreign

travel by subjects of current or past security investigations and

certain other individuals with subversive backgrounds.

A volume of

data concerning travel to Cuba by U. S. citizens and resident aliens

of the United States not previously of

security interest to us is

being received at the Bureau.

Current regulations, in effect since

January 19, 1961, require that U. S. citizens possess valid passports

specifically endorsed to authorize travel to Cuba before departing

for that country,

Resident aliens must have authorization from

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) before performing such

Section 1185, Title 8, U. S. Code, and Part 53, Title 22,

Code of Federal Regulations, are applicable and Section 1105 provides

penalties of not more than 95,000 fine or more than five years'

Imprisonment, or both, when illegal travel is performed by U.s.

INs has authority to deny re-entry to resident aliens who

did not have specific authority to leave the United States for Cuba.

Existing instructions in Section 87D, Manual of Instructions,

still apply in cases where travelers to Cuba fall within the specified

categories. In cases not covered by provisions therein the field

covered og

should, upon receipt of information indicating unauthorized travel

to Cuba has occurred, conduct sufficient investigation to positively

identify the individual involved, review indices, attempt to determine

reason for travel through available sources, and

furnish Bureau

memoranda suitable for dissemination under individual captions

containing the results thereof.

Copies of the memoranda should be

furnished INS locally in cases involving resident aliens and

naturalized citizens. All offices should remain alert for information

concerning violations but no investigation in addition to that

outlined above is desired

without specific Bureau instructions.

FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY APPLICANTS - PUBLICITY -- In connection

with appointments of local police officers to the FBI National

Academy, it is customary for me to address a letter to the head of

the police agency of each applicant who is to be invited. At the

same time, you are authorized to release pertinent facts concerning

such appointments to the press. In order to obtain wider press

coverage of such appointments, you should consider the advisabillty

of personally congratulating officers invited to the FBI National

Academy and arranging for the taking of appropriate photographs.

It would then be possible for these photographs and pertinent data

concerning the applicant and the FBI National Academy to be released

to interested news outlets in your area,

This procedure can best

be followed when the invited officers are from areas close to your

The contract garage in one of the Bureau offices recommends

this is not necessary.

This service was performed on two Bureau

vehicles as a preventive-maintenance measure:

Subsequent contact

with the Chrysler Motor Company reflects their engineers do not feel

this service necessary or warranted and they do not recommend.

Under no circumstances should the rear wheels be repacked as a

maintenance procedure without prior Bureau approval.

(C).. FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY - SIXTY-NINTH SESSION -- The 69th Session

of the FBI National Academy will begin on Monday, March 19, 1902;

It is desired that

you submit to the Bureau by October 13, 1961, the names of the

candidates from your territory whom you desire to recommend to

attend that session. Your attention

is called to instructions

previously given as to the procedures to be followed in nominating

candidates to attend the Academy, and it is desired that you strictly

by the former SAC within the preceding six months. It will not be

necessary, however, for the present SAC to reinterview any candidates

he, himself, interviewed even though more than six months have

elapsed since the time of the first interview.

You may designate more than one candidate for the 69th

Session since there is a possibility that your first candidate may

not be accepted or that two or more representatives will be accepted

from your office. In your letter listing your candidates, you must

specifically set forth the results of the reviews of your field

office indices concerning the applicants and their law enforcement

agencies.

I want to emphasize the fact that the Bureau is desirous

of accepting at the National Academy only those candidates who are

outstanding both as to personal appearance and ability. The weight

standards for National Academy applicants are the same as for our

own personnel. Applicants must be within the desirable weight limits

as set forth on form FD-300.

You are again reminded that the fingerprints of National

: Academy applicants are to be submitted

at the time the results of

the formal interview are forwarded to the Bureau. You should make

a notation on the fingerprint card that the fingerprints are those

of a National Academy applicant. The card should be forwarded to

the Bureau, Attention: Training and Inspection Division.

I shall expect each SAC to give very close personal

attention to the selection of candidates for attendance at the

National Academy.

(G) CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES - SUBVERSIVE

ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION -- The following subversive

organization characterization should be utilized effective

Immediately in characterizing the Citizens Committee for Constitu-

tional Liberties.

The sources utilized in the characterization

are all described as having furnished reliable information in the

past and the New York Office has advised that careful consideration

was given to each source concealed.

CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES

A source advised on June 11, 1961, that a meeting of the

National Executive Committee (NEC), Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) ,

was

held on June 10, 1961, at Communist Party headquarters, 23 West 26th

Street, New York, New

York. According to the source,

the main topic

of discussion at this meeting was the Communist Party's plans in

regard to combating the June 5, 1961, decision of the United States

Supreme Court,

requiring the communist Party to register with the

Attorney General of the United States as a communist-action organi-

zation pursuant to the provisions of the Subversive Activities Control

Act of 1950,

and the Court's decision of the same date upholding the

April 21, 1955, conviction of

'Junius Scales under the Smith Act

provision covering membership in the Communist Party. This source

further advised that during this discussion a special Communist Party

defense committee was formed and it was decided

that this committee

would have an office, which would be managed by Miriam Friedlander

who according to the source is a member of the CPUSA National

Committee.

Another source advised on June 14, 1961, that at a meeting

of the CPUSA National Board and invited guests held on that date at

Communist Party headquarters, New York City, it was announced that

the Communist Party defense committee would have an office at 22 East

I7th street, New York, New York, under the name of the Citizens

Committee for Constitutional Liberties (CCFCL).

A third source advised on July 20, 1901, that at a meeting

of the Communist Party defense committee held on that date at

communist farty headquarters, New York City, the purpose and scope

of the CCFCL was discussed.

It was stated that this committee has

been set up to serve as a national coordinator and service center

for every effort being made by whatever source to repeal the McCarran

and Smith Acts. In addition it has been set up to reverse the

Supreme Court's decision of June 5, 1961, or secure an indefinite

stay of any enforcement of the law by the Department of Justice.

regarding investigations of Chinese entering U. S. as citizens or

permanent resident aliens no were 17 years of age or older at the

time they departed Communist China.

Arrangements are now in effect whereby we can cover a

third group, namely, those iho enter the U. S. on student visas.

control file for this program is

division covering visa recipient's destination, together with tio

copies of Legal Attache, Tokyo, letter which includes appropriate

instructions regarding investigation.

It is important to keep in mind the objectives of Bureau

programs regarding individuals who have formerly resided in Communist

China.

Purposes of our invéstigations are to identify Chinese

Communist Intelligence agents, obtain intelligence information of

Interest to Bureau and other Government agencies, develop informants

and double agents, and acquaint reputable Chinese with Bureau's

responsibilities

jurisdiction with regard to the internal security

of the United States, thus effecting a broad over all coverage

consisting of individuals ready and willing to assist the Bureau

In matters pertaining to Chinese Communist regime.

Recently, information was received from a confidential

source abroad of

new Chinese Communist method to surreptitiously

infiltrate target areas. This operation is called "Detouring

Tactics"

and consists of sending espionage agents by indirect

routes to their ultimate destinations.

such agents reportedly

leave Communist China at Hong Kong, British Crown Colony, and

proceed to transit areas such as singapore, Malaya, Burma and

Indonesia. The intelligence agents are under instructions to

find employment in Hong Kong as teachers in order to establish

a reputation for respectability prior to continuing to various

transit areas en route to their ultimate destination.

It is incumbent upon all personnel engaged in security

investigations to be fully aware of the grave responsibility of

the Bureau in the area of Chinese security matters. SAC Letters 58-72 (L)

and 58-81 (J) advised the Chinese Communists had approved a decision

to expand intelligence operations

particularly in the U. S. Although

we have received no indication to date of any organized

Chinese

Communist Intelligence activity in the U.S., we must assume that

Chinese Communists are actively pursuing their intention of eventually

carrying out organized intelligence activities in this country. The

importance of developing sufficient informant and source coverage in

order that such activity will be promptly brought to our attention is

obvious.

In all probability, the greatest handicap to chinese

Communist Intelligence activities in the U. S. is the absence of

a legal establishment in U. S. or adjacent

areas. We must assume

that the Chinese Communists recognize this handicap and are endeavoring

to overcome the inherent difficulties resulting from this situation.

Obviously, if the Chinese Communists can establish a diplomatic post

in the U. S. such as a delegation to the UN, they will then be in a

position to initiate intelligence operations. However, we must not

overlook possibility that Chinese Communists, failing to establish

diplomatic establishment in the U.S., may work through establishments

set up in the future in Latin America

or possibly even Canada. It is,

therefore, vitally important that the investigations we are currently

conducting in the Chinese security field be pursued with enthusiasm,

imagination and a determination to accomplish Bureau objectives.

(D) ! CONFIDENTIAL FUND - IMPREST FUND -- During the course of

a recent inspection of a Bureau field division, It was noted

that an Agent had received funds from the Confidential Fund

of the office to be used in paying for confidential services

rendered to the Bureau; however, contact with the payee was

not made promptly and the Agent did not return the funds to

the office account for a period in excess of 45 days. During

the audit of the Imprest Fund, It was noted that an Agent

had received funds from the Imprest Fund cashier for miscel-

laneous office purchases and that after five and one-half

months had elapsed, no receipts reflecting purchases had

been furnished by the Agent.

These two incidents indicate

poor judgment on the part of the Agent in not promptly handling

these transactions.

Undue delays in handling matters involving the

Confidential Fund and Imprest Fund will not be tolerated.

It

is the responsibility of every Bureau employee to carry out

his assignments with promptness and in accordance with existing

regulations and it is your responsibility to see that all

(E) TRAINING - LAW ENFORCEMENT CONFERENCES - DEMONSTRATIONS

OF POLYGRAPH AND COMPOSITE PICTURE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS --

It was recently brought to the attention of the Bureau that

an SAC intended to present demonstrations on a Composite Picture

Identification System and on the Polygraph by non-Bureau personnel

at a scheduled FBI Law Enforcement Conference on Bank Robbery

and Incidental Crimes.

The Bureau has carefully evaluated

Composite Picture Identification Systems and has neither endorsed

nor adopted any such system for identification purposes in

unknown subject cases. A demonstration of such a Composite

Picture Identification System at a Bureau-sponsored conference

might serve as a tacit endorsement and is therefore undesirable.

• By SAC Letters 60-43 (E) dated 9/13/60 and 61-39 (B) dated

7/25/61, you were advised of the

services of the Exhibits

Section at the Seat of Government. It was clearly set forth

that you should utilize artists' conceptions which could be

You were also advised that

there were illustrated brochures

describing the services of

this section available for distribution to United States Attorneys

and police officials. You should be completely familiar with

groups, and in one instance, a Field Office has been requested

to serve as a sponsor of a

work.

While the Bureau is in accord with the aims of this

It is felt it would be improper and unwise for the FBI

to officially sponsor any Boy Scout group. Should you be

approached regarding this program, you may offer full cooperation

in the nature of providing lectures,

and conducting the group on a tour of your office. Should an

preceding six-month period.

I have also noted that during this

same period the number of Agent days being used in the develop-

ment of informants has decreased over five per cent.

These

are unhealthy conditions.

nise in crime, riew legislation, and

added emphasis on organized crime make it necessary that our

criminal

informant coverage be increased proportionally. An

insufficient number of individuals under development as

potential criminal informants can only result in the future

deterioration of our criminal informant coverage.

It is incumbent on every Agent engaged in criminal

investigations to actively participate in this program.

Individuals should be selected for development who have the

potential as quality informants. Every consideration should

se given to the development of gamblers, bookmakers, and

individuals who have definite ties with the criminal underworld.

While these individuals are more difficult to cultivate as

informants, the results in the long run will be much greater.

Individuals under development should be contacted frequently

and when they agree to cooperate should be given definite

assignments.

You should advise the Bureau within 10 days of the

receipt of this letter what action you are taking to improve

the criminal informant program in your office.

of overtime being performed by some field investigative person-

nel and I firmly believe the overtime could be materially

reduced if field supervisory personnel would see to it that

such overtime as is necessary in the type of work handled by

the Bureau is equitably shared by all agents.

It has been noted that in some offices the daily

overtime of some agents exceeds

three hours per day, whereas

other agents in the same offices render a much less average

overtime. If all agents were required to share the work load,

the average would drop accordingly.

I want all overtime reduced to an absolute minimum,

RE: RADIO FREQUENCY MICROPHONE-

TELEPHONE DEVICE (RFMT)

No Number SAC Letter V, Series 1952, dated July 14, 1952,

advised that the FBI Laboratory developed an instrument which imposes

a radio frequency on a telephone line and converts the telephone

Instrument into a microphone without entering the premises where

the telephone is located. You were instructed to admonish your

Security Supervisors and Sound-Trained Agents that this technique

and that it should not be dis-

not be daque

cussed with other than Agent personnel in these two categories.

The device has recently been reclassified as "Secret."

It will, therefore,

not be necessary to continue the former practice

of keeping this device in the personal custody of an Agent at all

times

when it is not stored in an approved field office space.

Henceforth, when the device is not operated under the personal

custody or

supervision of an Agent, it may be placed in a steel

. cabinet which cabinet is equipped with a steel lockbar and a

changeable three-number, manipulation-proof, combination dial-type

padlock.

The cabinet must be bolted or otherwise securely affixed

to the floor of a closet or equally secluded space.

The closet

or secluded space must not have a window or other similar opening

and must be equipped with a door that can be securely locked with

a cylinder-type lock having no less than five pins with all the

keys to the lock being under the exclusive control of Bureau

personnel.

The closet or secluded space must be in an apartment

or area under the exclusive control of the Bureau and arranged

so that equipment servicing can be performed at any time during

the day or night without jeopardizing the security of the instal-

lation.

The doors to the closet and all doors and windows in

the controlled space must be equipped with a fall-sare type alarm

device that will alert monitoring personnel to unauthorized entry.

This technique will operate successfully only under

certain conditions. It will be necessary that a detailed survey •

of the telephone company subscriber equipment and telephone cable

facilities serving the subscriber be made in each Instance prior

to installation of the equipment.

This survey should be forwarded

o the bureau, attention ibi Laboratory, Ior review. If ar

installation appears leasible, a specially trained technician Iron

the laboratory or from key points in the field will be sent to

make the installation.

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 273

## Page 274

Use of this equipment will be approved only on a most

selective basis. It will be necessary, therefore; for all

requests to use

the device to be supported by adequate information

reflecting the essential need to obtain this coverage and the

reasons why such coverage is not feasible by other means. All

communications concerning

this equipment should be captioned

"RFMT" and transmitted as "JUNE"

The use of RFMT in the unattended manner described

above will permit running it into a central plant for monitoring.

It is recognized that the monitoring of this and other types

of microphone surveillances at a central point will result in

a saving of man power to the extent that it will release any

men who are otherwise on equipment guard duty when the subject

is inactive.

However, in general, this saving will be at the

cost of some loss of intelligence

because of the loss of

intelligibility inherent in running the wires over a longer

distance.

There is, of course, no saving in man power during

periods when the subject is active as there is no method which

will reliably signal the presence of a conversation in the

microphone target area and 1t is, therefore, imperative that

the individual microphone surveillances be separately manned

during the periods when the subjects are active.

This is in

contrast with the case of telephone surveillances where there

are technical differences which permit us to have a signalling

device to reliably indicate the presence of conversations so

that monitoring personnel can restrict their attention to

those lines which are active and thus can be reduced to a

minimum consistent with the volume of traffic.

I will hold each SAC personally responsible for the

security of RFMT equipment assigned his office and for adequately

covering each microphone and telephone surveillance operating

within the field office territory.

(A) THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE COURT JUDGES -- The Committee

on Law Enforcement for The National Council of Juvenile Court

Judges currently is communicating with law enforcement officials

throughout the country seeking their views on the juvenile problem.

One SAC already has received an inquiry from a member of the

Committee in his territory and it may be assumed that similar

Inquiries will be made of other SAC's. Liaison has been established

with The National Council of Juvenile Court Judges, and there has

been frequent contact with Judge James P. Gossett of Gooding, Icano,

Chairman of the Committee on Law Enforcement, regarding the work

of this Committee. Should you receive any inquiry from a member

of this Committee, you should advise the individual that our views

already have been furnished to the Committee Chairman. Copies of

any communications you receive relating to this matter should be

sent to the Bureau, Attention: Crime Records under the caption

"The National Council of Juvenile Court Judges."

(B) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SURVEY BY GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

(GSA) - TELEPHONES AND TELETYPES -- The Bureau does not intena

to

utilize local GSA communications facilities and will not give

further consideration to the Bureau's possible participation in

the Federal Telecommunications System until such time as that

system has been completely implemented and definite information

can be obtained regarding the type of service and priorities which

are actually available at that time and specific cost data can be

furnished to the Bureau to permit a determination as to whether

economies can be effected. In view of this, the Bureau does not

desire to participate in the local surveys being conducted by GSA

on the part of our telephone operators and have a tendency to

interfere with day-to-day operations.

If any requests are received from GSA or local telephone

companies for permission to conduct such surveys or to furnish

any other information concerning our communications system, you

should tactfully advise them the Bureau does not wish to participate

in the surveys and decline to furnish the information.

(C): FIREARMS - CARRIED ABOARD ÄIRCRAFT -- As an answer to the

recent hijackings of aircraft by the use of firearms carried

on board those aircrait by passengers, Congress passed Public

Law 87-197 which prohibits unauthorized persons from carrying

weapons aboard aircraft.

Advice has been received from the Department that

this statute does not apply to Department of Justice personnel

authorized to carry. weapons. In this connection, the Attorney

General has issued the following instructions:

"I) All Department of Justice personnel who are

authorized to carry arms and who have them on their person

while travelling by air should present proper credentials to

the ticket agent or flight attendant when boarding the air-

craft, unless to identify themselves would, in their judgment,

compromise the success of their mission.

"2) When it is not feasible to inform the carrier

that they are carrying weapons, Department of Justice personnel

must act with the utmost discretion to avoid giving cause

for alarm to air carrier personnel or their fellow passengers. "

Each SAC will be held personally responsible for

insuring that these instructions of the Attorney General are

Immediately brought to the personal attention of all Special

Agents and insuring complete understanding of these instructions

• and full compliance with them.

(E) PRESIDENT'S PROGRAM ON STRENGTHENING OF COORDINATION OF GOVERN-.

MENT ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE WASHINGTON -- In a memorandum for heads of

departments and agencies dated November 10, 1961, the President

stated that as an integral part of present

steps

to increase the

effectiveness and

economy of Federal agencies he wants coordination

of Government activities outside Washington, D. C., significantly

strengthened. As a first step in bringing Federal officials out-

side Washington closer together the President has directed the

Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to arrange for establish-

ment of a Board of Federal Executives in each of the Commission's

ten administrative regions, the headquarters cities of such being

Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas,

Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle.

The purpose of the Boards will be to make possible closer

• and stronger coordination of activities across departmental and

agency lines and to implement opportunities to pool

experience and

resources and to accomplish savings.

The areas of interest involved

are management and budgetary procedures, personnel policies,

• recruitment, office space use, procurement activities, public infor-

mation duties, natural resources development, protection of equal

rights, urban

development activities, manpower utilization, etc.

Each Board will establish liaison with State and local Government

officials in its region.

You may be invited to attend conferences by the Board in

your region and if so, it will be satisfactory for you to attend

but only as an observer, advising the Bureau thereafter as to what

transpired. Should you

receive any request to actively participate

in this program or for anything that would commit the Bureau to a

course of action, such should be promptly brought to the attentior

of the Bureau for consideration.

SR-448A -- Attention is directed to Subsection (1) of Section

1472, Title 49, (Federal Aviation Act of 1958 as amended) which

deals with carrying weapons

aboard aircraft and specifically

prohibits carrying a concealed, deadly or dangerous weapon on

or about the person aboard an aircraft being operated by an air

carrier. This Section further pronibits an attempt to commit

such an act.

The Statute excepts from this prohibition "law

enforcement officials of any municipal or

state government,

or the Federal

Government, who are authorized or required

to

carry arms, and.... such other persons as may be so authorized

under regulations

issued by the (Federal Aviation Agency)

In accordance with the authority granted by the Statute,

the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) has issued Special Civil Air

Regulation No. SR-448A, which in part states as follows:

"Except for employees or officials of municipal,

state, or Federal Governments who are authorized

or required to carry arms, and except for those

crewmembers and such other persons as may be

authorized by an air carrier, no person, while

aboard an aircraft being operated by an

• air

carrier in air transportation, shall carry on

or about his person a deadly or dangerous

weapon, either concealed or unconcealed. "

In effect,

the FAA has granted the air carrier the right

to determine who shall be permitted to carry concealed weapons

aboard aircraft.

Whereas SR-448A is considerably broader than

Subsection (1), Section 1472, Title 49, since it covers uncon-

cealed weapons, the Statute limits violations within FBI juris-

diction to concealed, deadly or dangerous weapons.

In view of the provisions of Special Civil Air

Regulation No. SR-448A, you should insure in conducting investi-

gations under this Statute that the air carrier has not granted

authority for the individual in question to carry weapons aboard

aircraft.

in their respective jurisaictions the book "Tropic of Cancer" by

Henry Miller. Several field offices have inquired of the Bureau

as to this book being a suitable vehicle for prosecution under

the Interstate Transportation of Obscene Matter Statute.

This is to advise that after having carefully reviewed

this book the Department has concluded that Federal prosecution

would not be warranted. You should be guided accordingly.

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES -

- INCOME TAXES

• 1

No Number SAC Letter 64-E dated July 6, 1964, advised that

effective January 1, 1965, all field divisions must utilize the Bureau

Federal income tax withholding plan for payments to security informants

and sources. In order to place the plan in effect, you were to discuss

the matter with each informant and source where circumstances warranted

using the procedure and advise the Bureau by November 1, 1964, of the

identity of each exempted informant and the method used by each such

individual in reporting his Bureau income.

Communications being received from the field indicate that

the plan is being utilized for many informants but, at the same time,

there are a great many instances where the informant has not had any

difficulty in reporting his Bureau income in the past and, therefore,

these informants are being exempted by the field from the withholding

plan. The procedure was devised by the Bureau to afford informants

a method of reporting Bureau income in a secure manner and should

be utilized wherever necessary to prevent any embarrassing situations

in the future such as those which occur when an informant finds it

necessary to disclose his receipt of income from the FBI in response

to inquiries from Internal Revenue Service or it is later found that

taxes have not been paid on Bureau income.

There should be no further

instances of this type and you are reminded that if situations do arise

in the future where it is learned informants are not reporting Bureau

income and they have not used the withholding procedure, administrative

action will be considered by the Bureau in each such case.

MEMORANDUM 59-74

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

December 10, 1974

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) INFORMANT MATTERS -- As you are aware, the handling and developing

of informants is one of the most vital phases of the Bureau's work. The need

for quality of informants cannot be overstressed. Many of our informants are

paid for their services, which involves considerable sums of monies. These

factors alone demand close supervision in order to fulfill our responsibilities,

particularly to insure that all intormants receiving compensation are paid on

the basis of the value of information furnished, services rendered, and expenses

incurred in connection with obtaining information for the Bureau.

Accordingly, each Special Agent in Charge is to insure that all

pending informant files are to be reviewed personally by appropriate supervisory

personnel on a regular periodic basis not to exceed a period of 60 days. This

review must include the informant's file and its subfiles. During this review

care must be exercised to ascertain that the information furnished from inform-

ants has been recorded, indexed, evaluated, channelized, that full value has been

received, and all necessary action has been taken. These instructions should be

called to the attention of all Special Agents in your office handling informants

and sources.

the IAATI that it is not within the purview of my official duties to endorse,

recommend, or approve membership therein by FBI Special Agents. There is

no prohibition against an Agent's joining this group but any decision regarding

membership must be made solely by the Agent on an individual basis.

(B) VICE PRESIDENT'S YOUTH OPPORTUNITY TASK FORCE -

MISCELLANEOUS -- The Bureau, as well as numerous other agencies of

the Government, was requested by this. Task Force to furnish various data

concerning 45 cities throughout the country. Bureau Field Oftices are

deadquartered at 35 of the localities. Data furnished concerning these

headquarters cities included the name of the Special Agent in Charge; total

employees and estimated annual payroll for the Field Office; total number

of investigative matters handled for the fiscal year 1965; limited crime

statistics for 1965 under the Uniform Crime Reporting Program; names of

local officials, such as the chief of pulice, contacted by you at the headquarters

city; and the identity of contracts amounting to over $10, 000 during the current

fiscal year. The Field Offices for which such data were listed were contacted

by the Bureau as to the identities of the local officials.

It is not known what use the Vice President's Youth Opportunity

Task Force may make of the information furnished. Should you receive some

inquiry or receive information that others whose identities were furnished

have been contacted as a result of the information made available to the Task

Force, you should promptly advise the Bureau.

(C; AUTOMOBILES - DEFECTIVE BRAKES - In the recent past several

serious automobile accidents involving Bureau vehicles were found to have

been caused by defective brakes. While there was substantial property

damage in all these accidents, fortunately none of the occupants sustained

serious physical injury. It cannot be stressed too strongly that the proper

functioning of the brake system is of prime consideration in maintaining

Bureau vehicles. No other one factor is so important in the safe and efficient

operation of our equipment.

While it is neither necessary nor practical to pull all wheels and

inspect brake linings and wheel cylinders or the master cylinder on a time or

mileage basis, certain conditions do warrant such inspection.

For example,

the majority of our vehicles have self-adjusting, power brakes. The brake

pedal travel should be maintained at no less than two-thirds of the full position

at all times. During the monthly inspection, or at any other time it is found

necessary to adjust the foot brake to maintain required travel, a check should

be made concerning the condition of the brake linings. The same thing applies

when it is necessary to adjust the parking brake. Further, at any time it is

found necessary to replenish the fluid in the master cylinder, an inspection

jhould be made to determine the reason for adding fluid.

In addition to the

foregoing, good judgment dictates that a detailed inspection should be made

of the brake system any time it is necessary to remove wheels for packing

bearings or for other reasons or on any occasion when there is some reason

to believe there is a possible brake maliunction.

In view of the serious nature of accidents which can result from

brake failures, it is desired this matter be brought to the attention of all

personnel operating Bureau vehicles. They should be instructed to be particu-

larly alert for any indication of possible brake malfunction. At any time there

is a question as to the safe condition of the braking system it should be resolved

by performing whatever inspection is necessary and taking any corrective

action required.

(E) CRIMINAL, INFORMANT PROGRAM -- Live, high-quality informant

coverage in all areas of the Bureau's jurisdiction is a constant urgent

necessity. Increased investigative responsibilities and necessary curtailment

of certain investigative techniques emphasize that continued attention must be

placed on the Bureau's Criminal Informant Program. During discussion at

the recently completed Criminal Informant In-Service School it was recognized

that to meet the challenge of successfully infiltrating criminal activities with

live informant coverage we must increase the number of quality informants,

exercise careful control of their activities in our behalf and insure that

payments to informants are commensurate with the value of data received

from them.

(

The importance of the development of quality informants should

be the subject of continued concentration by each office. Good informants can

be an excellent source for developing violations which otherwise might not

come to our attention. In addition, as you are aware, there are many

situations where solution of cases can-be accomplished only through information

developed by informants. Thus, the better the informant coverage in all areas

of criminal activities, the better will we be able to carry out our responsibilities

and make the most effective use of Agent investigative time. Therefore, I

want you to give this matter your continuing personal attention. It is your

responsibility to insure that newer Agents are given necessary guidance and

training in the development and handling of criminal informants. Continue to

keep on the alert for situations which might be the basis for developing new

informants. Make certain all Agents assigned criminal investigations are well-

grounded in the fundamentals of selection, development and utilization of

informants. Agents of proven ability and experience in cultivation of informants

should be encouraged and given the opportunity to participate in your informant

training program.

One measure of the effectiveness of the Criminal Informant

erogram of a particular office is the analysis made of accomplishments

reported which can be credited to informants. Make sure your offíce is

reporting all accomplishments. attributable to informants. It is obvious

from reviewing material at the Bureau that this is not being done in all

instances. In this connection, refer to Section 108 H (1), Manual of

Instructions, regarding submission of Molithly Progress Letter and also

## Page 289

to SAC Letter Number 65-44 (D) dated 8/17/65.

Selection and payment of individuals as informants must be

accompanied by good judgment. Due to the type of individuals we are

dealing with in most instances, effective control must be exercised at all

times and Agents handling informants must continually be on the alert to

anticipate and avoid possible situations which could be a source of

embarrassment. This is particularly true of individuals to whom payment

is the inducement to furnish information.

(A) VOICE IDENTIFICATION -- The Laboratory, over a long period of

time, has closely followed the possibilities of identifying individuals by

analyzing and comparing known and questioned recordings of their

voices. Recently the Laboratory acquired additional facilities for

analyzing recorded speech and will conduct voice analysis examinations

as an investigative aid in Bureau cases.

The technique is still considered to be in the experimental

stages and it is not sufficiently authenticated by quantitative tests and

experience to serve as a unique means of identification with subsequent

court testimony to that effect. It is, however, felt that it is at a stage

to offer investigative guidance in selected Bureau cases.

Known and questioned recorded material for examination

should be forwarded to the FBI Laboratory, attention Electronics Section.

A verbatim transcript of the recorded material should accompany the

submitted material. Foreign language recordings should be accompanied

by a verbatim transcript as well as the English translation.

Attached are details for guidance in the preparation of the

In such instances or where the caller is abusive or incoherent,

it is suggested that the caller be advised courteously and firmly that hẹ

should come to the FBI office personally at his convenience to furnish

the details of his complaint or information.

As you are aware, it is a vital necessity that in all our contacts

with the public we display courtesy and real concern for the problems

brought to us. However, we have neither the time nor the duty to listen

to telephonic abuse or alcoholic ramblings. You should, of course,

continue to make a record of all calls received by your office and where

a situation exists indicating the need to request the caller to come to the

office to furnish information, the memorandum recording the call should

show the reasons why this course of action was followed.

(C) OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT -- Regulations require that the Bureau be

advised when an employee terminates outside employment. Furthermore,

at the time an employee asks approval for such employment, it must be

indicated on the formal request (Form FD-331) that the employee has

been advised of his responsibility to notify his supervisor upon termination.

A recent survey disclosed a number of instances wherein the

Bureau had not been advised of the termination of outside employment or

that the employee had decided not to accept employment which had been

approved. Each Division head must insure that all employees approved

to engage in outside employment are impressed with their responsibility

to promptly advise the Bureau when it ceases or that it was not accepted.

Form FD-331a should be used for either purpose.

Hereafter, each Division must advise the Bureau by January 15

of each year that verification has been made that each employee authorized

for outside employment is still so engaged. An administrative tickler is

to be maintained to this effect. Authority is granted to maintain a copy of

each FD-331 submitted to the Bureau or some other tickler for following

on authorizations granted. In those cases where your annual check

reveals a failure on the part of an employee to promptly advise of the

termination or nonacceptance of outside employment, submit his written

explanation together with an appropriate recommendation for administrative

action.

• and opened by unauthorized persons. Accordingly, each Special Agent in

Your report, indicating whether or not a saving was accomplished

during the survey through elimination of telephone equipment and facilities,

and itemizing facilities removed and monthly saving for each item removed,

should be submitted with fully executed Form FD-344 signed by you to reach

the Bureau no later than March 10, 1965.

Include in your report an explanation for any increase in total fixed

costs since last previous submission of FD-344.

In reporting results of this survey in your division do not report

savings accrued from removal of equipment or facilities prior to the survey,

or equipment and facilities ordered removed by Bureau Inspector unless ordered

out of service by the Inspector during the survey, in which case the Bureau

should be advised of the fact that it was ordered removed by an Inspector.

Bureau Inspectors are continuing to find surplus telephone trunks,

telephone instruments, etc. in field headquarters and resident agencies.

continual increase in bankruptcy filings. Correspondingly, the Bureau

has and should be experiencing a case increase in this classification.

You must insure that all investigative personnel, during their

daily contacts with various sources including criminal informants and

potential criminal informants, are constantly on the alert for possible

violations of the criminal statutes of the National Bankruptcy Act.

Regarding complaints received from the Bankruptcy Court,

you should continue to have an Agent, experienced in the handling of

bankruptcy matters, contact the various referees, in the judicial district

covered by your office, on an annual basis to insure that each referee is

promptly referring cases in accordance with Section 3057, Title 18,

U. S. Code. Your contacts with referees should continue to be a matter

of record in your 49-0 file.

The Bureau has experienced an increase in planned fraudulent

bankruptcies involving hoodlums and you must insure that criminal informants

and potential criminal informants, close to the hoodlum element, are fully

cognizant of the Bureau's interest in this violation. For your information

the two most frequently used schemes by the hoodlum are:

(1) The hoodlum has a front man open a business such as

furniture, Jewelry, or produce and so forth, stocks the business with

merchandise on short term credit, orders additional merchandise on

the established credit and sells the merchandise quickly below cost.

Usually in this type of case the front man disappears from the business

and the defrauded creditors eventually place the business into involuntary

bankruptcy.

(2) In another scheme a legitimate businessman who cannot

meet his financial payments, possibly due to gambling debts or sudden

business reversals, finds himself with a racketeer partner and the

racketeer then uses the legitimate businessman's credit to carry out a

fraudulent bankruptcy scheme.

Credit Bureaus such as Dun and Bradstreet have proven to be

excellent sources of these cases and it is usually brought to their

attention through an avalanche of inquiries from creditors.

Prompt investigation in bankruptcy cases is essential, especially

in cases involving missing assets or records. You must be certain that

investigative personnel handling such cases afford them expeditious attention.

(G) DEVELOPMENT OF SOURCES IN RACIAL MATTERS - AMERICAN

LEGION CONTACT PROGRAM - PLANT INFORMANT PROGRAM -- In

our over-all current efforts to increase the quantity and quality of coverage

of racial matters, the use of the American Legion Contact and Plant

Informant Programs has been given serious consideration. The selfish

utilization of the current Negro struggle for civil rights is not restricted

to those individuals described as subversive because of affiliation with

the Communist Party, USA, or other left groups. As an example, hate

groups such as the Klans, are exploiting the tension developed in the

South as the result of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Appealing

to prejudice and bigotry, the promotion of "white supremacy" is the

primary goal of these right extremists with specific targets including the

foreign-born, Catholics and Jews. Bearing in mind our responsibilities

in this field, not only to get evidence and intelligence data, but to be aware

of all related data on which preventive measures may be taken, you should

take the following steps:

Where feasible and you consider it to the Bureau's advantage,

contacts and informants included in these two programs should be advised

of the Bureau's interest and responsibility in covering activities which

may be considered racial in nature.

This should be done during the next

scheduled meeting. A prerequisite to initiating this program is a thorough

knowledge of current instructions pertaining to racial matters, sources

and informants, particularly those specific instructions concerning acts

of violence. The individuals contacted should be made sufficiently

familiar with the Bureau's desires in this matter so as to avoid the receipt

of nebulous information. Along this line, you should take no steps that might

diminish our efforts of gathering intelligence data, even though there is no

immediate and apparent Federal violation. We have a definite responsibility

of advising appropriate governmental agencies on both a national and local

level of information relating to racial incidents. Extreme care must be

exercised to insure there is no misunderstanding of the Bureau's position

and goal in the racial field. Of particular importance is the insurance that

there is no basis for misinterpretation resulting in a false impression that

our action infringes upon the freedoms of speech and assemblage of a person

or group. To the contrary, our concern includes the guarantee of civil rights

and equality under law for all.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

RE: VOICE IDENTIFICATION

In submitting tape recordings of known and questioned

voices a verbatim transcript should be prepared by the field.

The transcript should accompany each submission.

When obtaining voice recordings for comparison, it

should be borne in mind that it is desirable to obtain as many

of the same words and word combinations used in the questioned

recording as leasible.

Several utterances of word combinations

used by the unknown subject are

valuable to voice comparisons

as the ability to identify a voice is dependent upon the quantity

and quality of the material as well as word content. It is also

desirable that the same words and same word sequence be obtained

in order to create an environment as nearly like that of the

questioned recording as possible.

The vocal transition from

word to another influences the voice picture, therefore best

comparisons are achieved when words are used in the same sequence.

Insure that the recording is as good technically as

possible.

The recordings should be made at any of the standard

tape recording speeds such as 3.75 inches per second, 7.5 inches

per second, etc.

Best results will be obtained if the recordings

are made with a full track recorder at 7.5 inches per second

using

standard recording tape. If possible, do not use "extended

play,"

"long play," or tapes with a base thickness less than

1.5 mils.

Recorded material should be protected against accidental

erasure during transit by placing the recording in a metal can or

metal foil designed for this purpose or by placing the tape in a

box so that there is a minimum of three inches between the reel

of tape and the outside of the shipping carton. The cans and

foil are available at the Bureau on request.

(A) EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION - SAFETY POLICY FOR THE FEDERAL

SERVICE -- Advise ail employees that on 2-16-65 the President issued a

Safety Policy for the Federal Service. The purpose of such policy is to

saleguard federal employees from personal injuries, reduce cost of injuries,

eliminate waste of materials; and it is both humanitarian and practical.

The policy seeks improvement concerning safety records. It includes the

promotion of safe practices on and off duty and includes protection to visitors

to Government buildings, installations, parks, forests and other facilities.

The President has urged Federal agencies to cooperate with State and

local governments, management, labor, and safety organizations in developing

and applying safety standards responsive to any changing conditions and the

pace of technological progress.

Although the Bureau has maintained an effective and extensive

safety program for years, we must make every effort to reduce the number

of work-related injuries.

You must stress accident prevention to all

employees during periodic office conferences. Each injury sustained in

your office should be most carefully analyzed and if it appears it could have

been avoided, immediate steps should be taken so that such type of accident

will not recur. You and every member of your office should remain alert

to accident potentials daily and take positive steps to remove accident

hazards. You should give this subject matter your personal attention and

make every effort to reduce the number of work-related injuries on a

continuing basis in the future. During periodic office inspections, your

administrative file will be checked for compliance.

(B) INVESTIGATION OF RACIAL MATTERS AND HATE GROUPS -

CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS -- During the course of our current investigations

• into racial matters, Klan and similar hate-type groups, information is

often obtained which would indicate possible violations of criminal laws

over which the FBl exercises investigative jurisdiction. It is imperative

that investigative personnel conducting such inquiries be alert to the FBI's

responsibilities in the criminal field.

Specifically, information has been received with increasing

frequency indicating hidden caches of weapons which may have been stolen

from the United States Government. Explosives and ammunition bearing

United States Government markings have frequently been reported in the

hands of individuals active in hate-type organizations. More often we have

received information concerning the location of machine guns or other

automatic-type weapons, the mere possession of which is a violation of

Federal law.

As you are aware, violations of the National and Federal Firearms

Acts come within the FBI s investigative jurisdiction when information

pertaining thereto is developed during the course of another Bureau investi-

gation.

Accordingly, you should alert all personnel with respect to

these investigative possibilities particularly in connection with violations

of the Theft of Government Property Statute and the National and Federal

Firearms Acts. When during the course of an official investigation we

receive information pertaining to possible violations of these statutes. a

separate investigation should be initiated. investigation vigorously pursued

(E) CI MINAL INFORMANTS - FBI FORM BOOK -- SAC Letter 64-56 (E),

dated 11/17/64 drew attention to the need for consistent reporting by field

offices of accomplishments attributed to informants. As was pointed out,

the Mc: thly Progress Letter is the proper vehicle for reporting this infor-

matior and should be all-inclusive for the month. To assist the field in

compil..g and making uniform reports and to adapt the information at the

Bureat i0 Automatic Data Processing equipment, several changes in

proced. re and format are necessary. These changes are explained here-

after;: -wever, in implementing these new procedures it is imperative to

compli cly report these statistics in the Monthly Progress Letters since

the aui. mation of the recording process will preclude follow-up correspond-

ence b: the Bureau with subsequent loss of credit io the submitting office.

The deadline for submission of these letters is being changed

to confirm to the deadline for submitting the Monthly Administrative Report

(Manua: of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 3E8). Thus these reports

are to be submitted by the third business day following the end of the month

for which prepared.

Separately, the Bureau is furnishing each office a supply of

forms (Forni FD-374) which will replace the current Monthly Progress

Letters. Three copies of the form are enclosed. Place one in the FBI

Form Book. The original only (no abstract) will be furnished to the Bureau

each month.

The form has thirteen items divided into two major groups,

Administrative Accomplishments and Statistica: Accomplishnents. The

five items under Administrative Accomplishments are self-explanatory;

however, the symbol numbers of the informants added and deleted under

items two and three must be set forth. Under Statistical Accomplishments

the statistics reported are those attributable to information furnished by

criminal informants and potential criminal informants. Each item

represents the total for the month concerning the subject of the item and

Item seven is included in the total of item six. Item eight is not included

in the totals of either items six or seven. Items eleven through thirteen

are to be reported as the total dollar value of stolen property recovered

or confiscated as a result of information furnished by criminal informants

or potential criminal informants.

The statistics reported in items nine, ten, twelve and thirteen

are the accomplishments of other law enforcement agencies as a result.of

our referral to them of information furnished by an informant, or potential

informant.

To support the total figures reported on Form FD-374 attach

additional pages, as necessary, headed by the name of the submitting

field office and the date. The information reported on these pages should

be divided into three categories; namely, "Bureau Matters, " "Local

Matters," and "Other Federal Matters." Under each category list three

columns: symbol number or identity of the potential criminal informant,

title and character of case, and the nature of the statistic being credited

to the informant. If, as in the case of local, State, or other Federal

violations, there is no case title, this information may be omitted; how-

ever, the description of the statistic should include enough information

to identify the type of violation. If two or more statistics result from

one informant on one case, list the statistics separately opposite the

informant.

(F) COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY - TELETYPE MESSAGES -- You have

been advised on previous occasions of the need for protecting Bureau com-

There is attached a copy of the "Agreement Between the Federal Bureau

of Investigation and the Secret Service Concerning Presidential Protection"

dated February 3, 1965. This Agreement has been signed by Mr. James J.

Rowley, Chief, U. S. Secret Service, and me. The contents of the attached

Agreement and the Appendices thereto should be carefully studied by you

and discussed in detail with all investigative personnel to insure full com-

pliance with the terms of the Agreement.

In the case of individuals falling within the terms of the Agreement

and who are subjects of pending investigative interest in which reports are

normally prepared, one copy of each report prepared in each case should be

disseminated to Secret Service locally and similar dissemination will be

made at the Seat of Government. In these cases an extra copy of the report

should be designated for the Bureau. In other instances in which reports

would not normally be submitted, letterhead memoranda may be utilized

in effecting dissemination to Secret Service in accordance with prior practice.

You will note that Appendix A to the Agreement requires the

Bureau to indicate the reason or reasons for referral to Secret Service

by a statement of the class or classes in Appendix B which the individual

referred fits. Therefore, in all cases in which dissemination is made

in the field you should indicate in the cover communication of transmittal

to the Bureau of the document disseminated the specific category or

categories in which the individual falls. Letterhead memoranda disseminated

to Secret Service showing only changes in status such as residence and/or

employment, however, need not be categorized.

Dissemination in Security Index cases will be handled as in the

past with the exceptions that investigative reports rather than letterhead

memoranda will be furnished and the subjects will be categorized in accordance

with the terms in the Agreement.

Your attention is directed to paragraph two, Section II, of the

Agreement dealing with subversive organizations or other groups whose

activities are inimical to the welfare of the United States. To date Secret •

Service has not requested reports on any organizations under investigation

by this Bureau other than those concerning which we are already disseminating

information and reports to Secret Service. In carrying out the terms of this

Agreement, the field must be alert during the course of the investigation

of an organization for information indicating a plot against the person of the

President. Upon receipt of such information complete details must be

immediately furnished to the nearest office of Secret Service and the Bureau

should be advised at the same time by teletype of the information furnished

and the fact it has been so disseminated. An immediate attempt should be

made to verify the information but no evaluation of the information should be

attempted. A letterhead memorandum should be prepared at once which

should include complete details disseminated and the identity of the Secret

Service officer to whom given. The memorandum should be promptly

disseminated locally and sufficient copies furnished the Bureau for dis-

semination at the Seat of Government. Thereafter, copies of all letterhead

memoranda and reports should be disseminated locally to Secret Service

on a continuing basis and extra copies of such communications should be

furnished the Bureau for dissemination to Secret Service at the Seat of

Government.

CONFIDENTIAL

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND

THE SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION

I. Purposes of Agreement

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) maintains the most comprehensive

files in the United States on subversive organizations or individuals and on

actual or possible criminal violations by individuals. It also siginates

itself and receives daily from other sources large numbers of reports on

individuals and organizations. One purpose of this agreement is to specify

that portion of the information on file with the FBI, or received or origin-

ated by it, which the Secret Service desires to receive in connection with

Its duty to protect the President.

The Secret Service has statutory authority to protect, or engage in

certain activities to protect the President. The FBI has general jurisdiction

in this country over subversion against the United States and will make avail-

able to the Secret Service information it may request or information which by

its nature reveals a definite or possible threat to the President's safety.

On the other hand, the authority of the Secret Service to protect the President

can be interpreted to authorize it to investigate subversive organizations and

individuals who might constitute a risk to the President. A second purpose of

this agreement is to insure the most effective protection for the President by

establishing a clear division of responsibility between the duties of the FBI

and the Secret Service. Such division will also avoid compromises of investi-

gations or sources and needless duplication of effort.

II. General Responsibilities

The Secret Service undertakes to identify Individuals who, because of

their individual propensities or characteristics, are dangerous to the person

of the President and to arrange for their neutralization as required. To

assist the Secret Service in identifying such individuals, the FBI agrees to

furnish the Secret Service information as set out in Section III of this

Agreement.

The FBI will inform the Secret Service of the identity of organizations

under investigation as subversive or possibly subversive and will furnish

Secret Service with reports on such of these groups as Secret Service shall

request. In connection with the FBI's responsibility to investigate such

organizations or any other groups whose activities are inimical to the welfare

of the United States and, therefore, warrant investigation, the FBI will be

alert to and promptly notify the Secret Service of any information indicating

a possible plot against the person of the President. Thereafter, it is the

responsibility of the Secret Service to initiate such action as is necessary

to neutralize such a plot.

The term "subversive" wherever used in this Agreement or Appendices hereto

shall mean persons or groups who knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise

or teach the duty, necessity or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the

Government of the United States or the government of any state, district or

possession thereof or the government of any political subdivision therein by

force or violence or by the assassination of any officer of any such government.

III. Information on Individuals to be Referred by FBI

In addition to the information already furnished, the FBI undertakes to

furnish or make available from its central files to the Secret service, all

information which falls into the categories set forth in Appendix A to this

Agreement, which, based on information available, can be identified with

individuals coming to its attention henceforth of the classes set forth in

Appendix B to this Agreement. The information to be furnished may be furnished

in more than one report, and in case of emergencies should be furnished as soon

as it is available.

This Agreement shall be reviewed annually by representatives of the FBI

and the Secret Service, or at such more frequent occasions as either the FBI

or the Secret Service may request, to make certain that the system of referrals

Is both practicable and productive. Revisions may be made on the authority of

the Director of the FBI and the Chief of the Secret Service.

IV. Investigation and Neutralization of Individuals Referred by FBI

The Secret Service agrees that it will conduct no investigation of any

referrals of individuals identified as members of subversive groups without

notifying the FBI although where time for consultation is not available it may

take action with respect to any such individual for the purpose of temporarily

neutralizing that individual as a possible threat to the President. Any

information obtained by the Secret Service through Investigation of such

• individual will be referred to the FBI..

The FBI will not conduct investigations of individuals directed solely

at establishing whether such individual is a danger to the President. FBI

Agents will, however, in conducting investigations of subversive or other

Individuals be alert to and report information received as is specified in

Appendix A to this Agreement, concerning any individual which would place him

in one or more of the classes in Appendix B to this Agreement.

The Secret Service undertakes to neutralize or arrange for the neutraliza-

tion, as required, to protect the President from all individuals referred by

the FBI. In order to effect the best possible security of the President, the

Secret Service and the FBI will take such steps as are necessary to insure that

the terms of this Agreement are fully carried out.

RE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS AGAINST

CHINESE COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE

ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES (CHICOIN)

Captioned case is used as control file to handle general matters

pertaining to Bureau's efforts to penetrate Chinese Communist (Chicom)

intelligence activities in the United States. Information has been received

by the Bureau from foreign and domestic intelligence agencies indicating

the Chicoms are endeavoring to obtain legally and illegally through various

western countries, intelligence data pertaining to industry, science,

research and political and military matters.

At the present time, the Bureau is exploring the following

procedures to combat Chicom intelligence activities in the United States.

The purpose behind these undertakings is to create in the Chicom Intelligence

Service an intelligence interest in our informants resulting in our penetration

of Chicom intelligence activities in the United States. Reliable Bureau

Chinese informants are being approached for the purpose of putting them

in personal contact with Chicom diplomatic establishments abroad and with

the New China News Agency in Canada and Mexico, which has been used

by the Chicoms as an intelligence cover in the past. Other Bureau informants

have sent communications, under the Bureau's direction, to friends and

agencies in Communist China. Chinese informants in scientific and technical

fields are being recruited to be put in personal contact with Chicom repre-

sentatives attending scientific and technical conferences abroad. Arrangements

are presently being made to place other Chinese informants in contact with

known and suspected Chinese intelligence agents in Hong Kong and to possibly

send Bureau informants into Communist China.

Although the procedures referred to above have involved the use

of existing Chinese security informants, the Bureau does not desire that our

efforts to penetrate Chicom intelligence activities in the United States be

restricted to the use of Chinese. In view of the fact the Chicoms are

presently engaged in efforts to foment revolutions and to collect intelligence

in various parts of the world, including Africa, Asia and Latin America, an

excellent opportunity is presented to use existing informants of other

nationalities, including orientals, other than Chinese, or to develop such

informants for use against the Chinese Intelligence Service. All offices

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 312

## Page 313

should be alert to such possibilities and immediately advise the Bureau of

any instances where such informants may be used against the Chinese

Intelligence Service.

A conference on Chinese matters held at the Bureau on

April 8-9, 1965, attended by representatives of Bureau offices handling

the majority of Chinese investigative matters, unanimously approved

continuation of the procedures referred to above. Any additional ideas,

procedures or programs which are suggested by this letter and which may

be of assistance in combatting Chicom intelligence activities in the United

States should be furnished the Bureau.

The procedures outlined above should be brought to the

attention of all investigative personnel handling security matters. Intel-

ligence operations growing out of captioned matter should be handled by

individual case and should not be handled in the Chicoin control file.

John Edgar Hoover

RE: BUREAU TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT -

EQUIPMENT SYNOPSIS

There are being transmitted directly to the SAC of each office

appropriate copies of an Equipment Synopsis summarizing Bureau technical

equipment available to the field for use as investigative aids. This sum-

mary, which includes photographs as well as a brief description of each

respective piece of equipment and a summary of its application; has been

made up by the FBI Laboratory primarily in order that the SAC, ASAC,

and other nontechnical supervisory personnel may have available for con-

venient reference such information to assist in planning and carrying out

field investigative responsibilities.

This material has been prepared at substantial effort. In order

to insure that most productive use is made of this Equipment Synopsis,

it is necessary that the SAC, ASAC, and such other Supervisors as the

SAC may designate become personally thoroughly familiar with its

contents through careful study. Each SAC and ASAC will be expected

to be thoroughly cognizant of the various items of equipment which are

available and thus be in position to coordinate the use of such equipment

with maximum effectiveness.

For purposes of accounting for the copies of the Equipment

Synopsis furnished, the material is prepared in the form of an addition

to the already existing Handbook of Technical Equipment. By being a

part of the Handbook of Technical Equipment, cross-referencing between

the Synopsis and the more detailed technical information contained else-

where in the Handbook has been facilitated. Each page of the Synopsis

bears a notation at the bottom of the page referring to the corresponding,

more detailed technical description of this equipment elsewhere in

the Handbook, or where applicable, instructs that the Bureau be con-

tacted for additional details due to the complex nature of the particular

technique or item of equipment.

Appropriate pages will be added or other revisions made as

needed from time to time, as new equipment is developed or existing

equipment is modified. The initial issue of the Equipment Synopsis has

been extended to include information on newest techniques and equipment

currently being processed for distribution to the field in the immediate

future.

As in the past, in the event a technical problem is encountered

in which assistance over and above that immediately available to your

office is required, such need should be made known promptly to the

Bureau in order that appropriate consideration may be given to sending

a Laboratory expert to the scene, or otherwise providing necessary

assistance.

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN

AMERICA,- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache

in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic who has already begun to make a

valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making

certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the

United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new

Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,

current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well

become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin

America threatened with communism.

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau

in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in

other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the

heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to

assume in the intelligence field. To guarantee our complete success,

• teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing

quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the

Dominican Republic.

/ In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish

to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption

of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

:1i Identities of any established sources (former or current)

who are now in the Dominican Republic.

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of

your office who appear to have good source potential.

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of

nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)

in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache,

Santo Domingo.

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources

for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by

teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,

your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and

sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained

during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved

in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-

ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each

office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial

numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the

territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage

sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature,

plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data

concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field

is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be

overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development

program.

FEDERAL EMPLOYEE HEALTH SERVICES - With increasing frequency,

field offices are being contacted by General Services Administration relative to

establishment of Health Service units in Federal buildings, occupying agencies

to participate on a reimbursable basis. Such centralized services are

purportedly arranged when providing them would insure increased efficiency

and economy to the Government without hampering program activities or

essential internal administration of the agencies. Bureau has consistently

taken the position that we are not interested in participating in such programs.

Experience has indicated that records are inefficiently maintained and

unavailable regarding employees who use such units.

Accordingly, in the future when such approaches are made by

General Services Administration or any other agency, you should respond by

stating the Bureau is not interested. If necessary to furnish such declination

of interest in writing, you are authorized to sign the appropriate communication

as authorized agency officer. Reasons for declining are generally not requested

and in no instances should be furnished without prior approval. Bureau should

be informed of each such request together with the response you made.

Where we have more than one field office covering parts of the

same state and an applicant is nominated from a state agency to the FBI

National Academy, the office making the nomination should send a copy of

their recommendation to the other field offices covering that state for a check •

of their files to determine if there is any reason why the candidate should not

be accepted for the FBI National Academy.

It will be incumbent upon offices covering the same state to keep

each other advised of any derogatory information developed concerning a

member of a state agency from which nominations to the FBI National Academy

might be made.

• (C) CUBAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES - EFFORTS

TO RECRUIT CUBAN REFUGEES TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE INFORMA-

TION -- During recent months, a number of Cuban refugees residing in the

United States have received unsolicited mimeographed letters wich requested

the addressee to cooperate with the Cuban Government by gathering information

of an intelligence nature which the addressee was requested to furnish to the

Cubans by means of secret-writing letter. All of the letters received by the

refugees to date have been postmarked at New York City and the sender has

utilized fictitious names although a number of the return addresses utilized

actually exist.

The above mineographed letter sets forth an accommodation

address in Cuba to be utilized by the addressee as well as detailed information

concerning the preparation and mailing of secret-writing letters to the

accommodation address.

In most cases, the recipients of these letters have recently been

in contact with Cuban authorities regarding permission to visit Cuba or other

matters requiring action by a Cuban Government agency. The FBI Laboratory

has determined that all mimeographed letters received to date were prepared

on the same mimeograph machine and investigation is being conducted in an

effort to identify the person or persons responsible for this activity.

Since it appears that efforts to recruit Cuban refugees for the

purpose of gathering intelligence information on behalf of the Cuban Government

may become widespread, the code name CODENANE has been assigned and

communications regarding investigation of the above-described activity should

be so captioned. Bureau file in this matter is FILE #

• Offices receiving

information concerning the above-described activity should promptly bring

this information to the attention of the Bureau and any pertinent material

obtained should be forwarded to the FBI Laboratory for appropriate examination.

Progressive Labor Movement. At its recent first national convention this

organization changed its name to the Progressive Labor Party.

Set forth below is an up-to-date characterization of the Progressive

Labor Party which henceforth should be used in characterizing this organization.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY (PLP)

PROGRESSIVE LABOR MOVEMENT (PLM)

A source advised on April 20, 1965, that the PLP, formerly known

as the PLM, held its first national convention April 15-18, 1965, at New York

City, to organize the PLM into a PLP. The PLP will have as its ultimate

objective the establishment of a militant working class movement based on

Marxism-Leninism.

"The New York Times," City Edition, Tuesday, April 20, 1965,

page 27, reported that a new party of "revolutionary socialism" was formally

founded on April 18, 1965, under the name of the PLP. The PLP was described

as an outgrowth of the PLM. Its officers were identified as Milton Rosen,

New York, President, and William Epton of New York and Mort Scheer of San

Francisco, Vice Presidents. A 20-member National Committee was elected

to direct the party until the next convention.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor Movement was

founded in 1962 by Mr. Rosen and Mr. Scheer after they were expelled from

the Communist Party of the United States for assertedly following the Chinese

Communist line."

The PLP publishes the "Marxist-Leninist Quarterly," a theoretical

magazine; "Progressive Labor," a monthly magazine; "Challenge," a New York

City newspaper; and "Spark," a west coast newspaper.

The June 1, 1965, issue of "Challenge," page 6, states that, "this

paper is dedicated to fight for a new way of life - where the working men and

women own and control their homes, factories, the police, courts, and the

entire government on every level."

The source advised that the PLP utilizes the address of General

Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn 1, New York, but also utilizes an office in Room

622, 132 Nassau Street, New York City, where PLP publications are prepared.

(A) UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS - SUGGESTIONS -- A complicating factor

in the anticipated increase of criminal cases going to trial in the Federal

courts with the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, is the

continuing process of appointment of new Assistant United States Attorneys.

Many are initially inexperienced in the handling of criminal matters and

must rely on "on-the-job" training to gain necessary knowledge and

experience.

Offices which do not now utilize a similar program should con-

sider the appointment of the new Assistant United States Attorney as an

opportunity to afford that individual a tour of our facilities and offer an

explanation of the facilities and our jurisdiction and responsibilities. We

can thus assist in his indoctrination and training and at the same time

encourage his assistance and cooperation. Such a program, if instituted,

should utilize experienced Special Agent or supervisory personnel in the

contact with the newly appointed Assistant United States Attorney.

(B). PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERS - FBI LAW ENFORCEMENT BULLETIN --

Please refer to SAC Letter 64-62 on submitting suggestions for by-line

articles for the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin.

You will note commencing with the July, 1965, issue some

changes in the format, make-up and style of the Bulletin have been made

which should improve its appearance, increase reader interest and help

to maintain the magazine as the country's foremost law enforcement

publication. One major change is a photograph on the front cover. The

success of this change will depend primarily on the quality and nature

of the photographs used. Accordingly, I desire that each SAC give special

attention to this particular phase of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin

program.

Generally, the cover photograph should relate to an inside

feature or major article. Beginning immediately, each office having an

outstanding request for a by-line article must endeavor to include among

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 322

---

## Page 323

the illustrations submitted with the manuscript to the Bureau a photograph

deemed suitable for use on the cover. The Bureau realizes that there will

be instances when this will not be possible. These should be the exception

rather than the rule. Set forth below are some salient points for your

guidance in selecting and/or making cover photographs.

The photographs should possess physical qualities which make

them reproduce well. They should be glossy prints, black and white with

sharp graduations between the two colors. The pictures should be in

clear focus. Their size when reproduced on the cover will be approximately

six inches deep and six and one-half inches wide. For best results, glossy

prints 8 x 10 inches are preferable since reducing the size results in

sharper quality than reproductions of equal size or larger. Look for

pictures that communicate, pictures with movement and story value. Cover

pictures should be simple yet dramatic in composition, and their message

should be grasped by the reader immediately. They should have some

special significance to the article with which they are connected and/or

the magazine as a journal of law enforcement. As a general rule, the

Bureau does not plan to use portrait-type pictures of authors or law

enforcement personalities on the cover. Avoid photographs of massed

groups or those that are otherwise cluttered. Photographs of officers

in action, when properly attired in uniform, are acceptable if their meaning

is readily clear.

The Bureau, of course, through photographic facilities at the

Seat of Government will be alert to those occasions when cover pictures can

be obtained here. However, the more appropriate and significant shots

must come from the source of the articles used. Make certain that the

authors of by-line articles are aware of our needs and wishes in this

regard; however, as with the manuscripts, no commitment should

be made as to the final use of the pictures since many factors enter into the

selection of cover stories.

Since only twelve top-quality cover photographs will be needed

each year, I fully expect all SACs to assist in this project so that each

month the Bureau will have several exceptional and outstanding photographs

from which to choose.

(C) LABOR-MANAGEMENT REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1959 -

SECURITY MATTER - INTERNAL SECURITY ACT OF 1950 - LABOR --

• On June 7, 1965, the United States Supreme Court held Section 504 of the

Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 to be unconstitutional.

The Department has advised that this decision precludes any possible criminal

prosecution under this Section, and it is, therefore, not requesting further

investigations of possible violations of Section 504.

All Offices should immediately carefully review present cases

bearing the caption "Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of

1959-Security Matter," to determine if the cases may also involve a possible

violation of Section 5 (a) (1) (E) of the Internal Security Act of 1950. If no

possible violation of the labor provision of the Internal Security Act of 1950

exists, the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 cases

may be closed administratively. In all cases where a possible violation of

the labor provision of the Internal Security Act of 1950 exists, the character

"Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959-Security Matters,"

should be deleted, and future reports and letters should be submitted under

the caption, "Internal Security Act of 1950-Labor. "

The above does not alter or affect current Bureau instructions

relative to matters handled under the character "Labor-Management Reporting

and Disclosure Act of 1959 - Investigative Matters.".

(D) DESCRIPTIVE DATA OF AUTOMOBILES IN INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING

SOVIET-BLOC AND YUGOSLAV REPRESENTATIVES -- In all cases in which

it is necessary to obtain descriptive information concerning an automobile

in the course of an investigation involving Soviet-bloc and Yugoslav repre-

sentatives in this country, the repository of the records of motor vehicles of

the state in which the vehicle is registered should be checked. If the color

of the vehicle is not included in the records, the color, when otherwise

determined, should be added to the description. This description should be

made a matter of record in the case file to which it pertains and maintained

so that it will be readily available to investigative personnel who may have

need of it. When it is ascertained that a subject will be traveling away

from his city of assignment by automobile, and physical surveillance is

contemplated, interested offices should be advised of the license number,

make, year, model and color of the vehicle. In the event the automobile

has any known obvious body damage or other physical characteristics which

would make it more readily recognizable, this information should also be

made known to interested offices. In the interest of accuracy, when

descriptions are developed solely from the observation of Agents conducting

physical surveillances, the descriptions of the vehicles in question should

be checked against the descriptions available from repository of motor

vehicle records to insure that any discrepancies which may have occurred

are promptly resolved and called to the attention of interested offices.

and there have not yet been any court decisions on this point.

The Bureau has primary investigative jurisdiction in this

regard, and at the request of the Department we have investigated a

number of restaurants that operate as clubs. In one city it was found

that Agents belonged to three of the clubs investigated. Such a situation

obviously has potential for embarrassment.

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 326

## Page 327

While the Bureau has no intention of interfering with

membership in legitimate organizations, all personnel should be

cautioned to be most circumspect in the organizations they join

and the organizations they may attend as guests, especially

those which may be subsequently found by the courts to be in

violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Although no hard and fast rules can be established,

each employee will be expected to exercise sound judgment in

this regard. Certainly membership should not be held in any

club formed for the purpose of evading the Civil Rights Act of

1964 nor should a Bureau employee attend such a club as a guest.

The purpose of evading the Act could readily be inferred with

regard to those restaurants which converted to a so-called club

status either after or shortly before the passage of the Civil

Rights Act of 1964.

The above should be discussed with all personnel.

(E) FUGITIVE INVESTIGATIONS - Outstanding results again were

achieved in fugitive investigations during the past fiscal year. The

field's effectiveness in carrying out fugitive investigations, including

the apprehension of many armed individuals, was in keeping with the

finest traditions of the FBI. In a number of instances Agents were

called upon to perform under extremely adverse, hazardous conditions.

Bureau Agents exhibited courage and excellent judgment in several

potentially explosive situations and thereby prevented injury to persons

near the scene, as well as to the Agents themselves. The esprit de

corps manifested in these difficult fugitive investigations, which

frequently involved all offices, is highly encouraging for the continued

outstanding performance in fugitive investigations.

Throughout the

year our work in this very important and critical area has met with

wide acclaim as was evidenced by numerous letters from public officials

and private individuals. This was particularly true with respect to the

Bureau's successful handling of investigations to locate fugitives who killed

or assaulted law enforcement officers.

It can be anticipated that there will be no lessening in the

number and serious nature of challenges which will have to be met in our

fugitive work during the ensuing fiscal year. To meet these challenges

it is important that we take every precaution to constantly maintain our

abilities at the highest possible peak. In planning and carrying out

fugitive assignments, give adequate thought to the utilization of seasoned

personnel to assist in giving experience to newer personnel and rounding

out the capabilities of the younger Agents. Also, in squad meetings and

other conferences, consideration should be given to discussion of particular

situations or techniques which have proven productive and successful in

between offices to the end that our personnel will be better equipped to

It should be noted that the Jackson Office was activated July 10,

• 1964, and Legal Attaches' Offices at Buenos Aires and Santo Domingo were

established March 9, 1965, and June 2, 1965, respectively.

An asterisk preceding the office designation denotes that the

office has a suggestion awaiting final resolution.

While there was a slight decline in the over-all total of sug-

gestions submitted from 1089 in Fiscal Year 1964 to 1042 in Fiscal Year

1965, the percentage of adoptions was a respectable 29. 2% and the

anticipated tangible savings of almost $45, 500 surpassed the previous

year's total.

I urge all of our employees to continue their support of this

(F) CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT OF 1964 - TRAINING - ARRESTS - SEARCHES

AND SEIZURES -- The Special Agents who attended the Specialized In-Service

on Legal Matters have completed the training and returned to their offices.

During the two weeks at the Seat of Government they were given courses of

unusual length and intensity in all of the principal areas of criminal law

applicable to the work of this Bureau. The purpose was to fully acquaint

one Agent from each office with the constantly increasing complexity of the

law and the rules which it is necessary that we follow. As you were advised

earlier, it is anticipated that the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, effective

August 20, 1965, will accentuate some of our problems with the criminal

law.

Each Special Agent who received this special training has been

advised that he will be required to repeat the instruction bearing on arrest,

search and seizure, and confession problems to all of the Special Agents

It is suggested the lectures be given in two-hour sessions. Field Divisions

with resident agencies may desire to arrange this training on a regional

basis in their territories. You should make appropriate arrangements for

this to be done, which includes allowing the instructor adequate time to

prepare his own lecture material from the notes and case citations given

to him. The decisions cited during the training at the Seat of Government

must be reviewed by the instructor so that he will be familiar with them.

(G) OPTIMIST INTERNATIONAL RESPECT FOR LAW PROGRAM --

Several months ago Dr. Carl L. Bowen, President of Optimist International,

spoke with me about an idea his organization had to generate citizen support

of law enforcement and to combat public apathy toward crime and the victims

of crime. I liked the idea and promised our support and assistance.

Since that time personnel at Bureau Headquarters have worked

with Optimist International staff members, counseling them on various

phases of the program and providing information. I sent a representative

to New Orleans to speak before the organization's convention on June 23,

1965, when the Respect for Law program was officially adopted.

Briefly, the program calls on local Optimist clubs to endeavor

to mold public opinion through publicity and speeches. Its main objectives

are to combat public apathy toward crime and criminals and to rekindie

proper respect for the law; to encourage citizens to cooperate with law

enforcement and to serve willingly as witnesses and on juries; and to

acquaint the public with the duties and needs of law enforcement and to

recognize outstanding services rendered by law enforcement officers.

Optimist International is preparing a handbook to send to each

of its clubs with instructions and various other material needed for the

implementation of this program. This suggests that local officials contact

various representatives of law enforcement in their areas, including the

FBI, as well as judges, clergymen and others.

You may be called on to participate in a radio or television

interview or panel-type program regarding crime and the need for citizen

support of law enforcement.

Such requests should be handled as any other

request for a public appearance. It you are called on for any statement

regarding the Respect for Law program you should merely state that the

International which is solely responsible for it.

RE: TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT

Recently the indiscriminate use of certain items of so-called

"bugging and snooping" equipment by certain Federal agencies has been

the subject of Congressional criticism and has resulted in a great deal

of publicity. As you are aware, the Bureau has always required that:

prior Bureau approval be obtained before utilizing telephone or microphone

surveillances and other highly confidential techniques. In order that there

may be no misunderstanding of the Bureau's desires in this area, the

requirement for prior Bureau approval is being restated to specifically

include, in addition to microphone and telephone technical surveillances,

the utilization of any technical equipment for covert gathering of intelligence

without the knowledge of the subject, such as X-ray mirrors, night viewing

devices, concealed cameras, special surveillance trucks, portable con-

cealed recorders, et cetera. The examples set forth are not meant to be

all-inclusive, but are merely examples of the type of activity this current

instruction is intended to cover. Each SAC will be held strictly responsible

to insure that this instruction is carried out.

John Edgar Hoover

RE: TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT

This is to reiterate long-standing instructions that technical

equipment be maintained under tight inventory control at all times.

Each SAC will be held personally responsible for the accuracy of

the entire inventory, particularly with reference to microphone and recording

devices and other technical equipment for covert intelligence gathering pur-

poses. Each SAC will also be held strictly accountable for rigid administrative

controls to insure the proper use of this equipment with prior Bureau authority.

When equipment is no longer currently needed in your division, it

should be promptly called to the Bureau's attention as available for return or

possible use elsewhere.

During inspections your maintenance of these inventory records

and your control over the use of technical equipment will be critically examined

by the Inspector. The Inspector will also conduct an independent audit of

your technical inventory records and will require full justification for all

technical equipment maintained in your office as well as for the use to which

it has been put since the last inspection.

You should afford this matter your continuing personal attention.

RE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS AGAINST

CHINESE COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE

ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES (CHICOIN)

In order that we may effectively combat the threat of Chinese

Communist (Chicom) intelligence activity directed against the United States,

the Bureau has embarked on an aggressive effort designed to place Bureau

informants in a position to penetrate Chicom intelligence. You were pro-

vided previous information concerning this procedure in No Number SAC

Letter 65-A.dated May 4, 1965.

This endeavor represents a challenge to the resourcefulness

and ingenuity of every Agent handling Chinese Communist matters. It is

my earnest desire that all offices participate fully in this procedure, being

alert to every opportunity to seize the initiative against this most dangerous

enemy.

The following is set forth for your future guidance:

I. Direction of Bureau Informants to Areas of Chicom Activity

Each office should be constantly on the alert for opportunities

to utilize established, reliable informants in this endeavor and to recruit

new sources for future use in this procedure. Be especially alert to the

use of Latin-American, Negro, and other non-Chinese sources.

Since these informants may be given very sensitive assign-

ments, they should be brought into the Chicoin procedure with extreme

care and under no circumstances should an informant be made aware that

his mission is part of an over-all program. Contacts with informants

should be well planned and well concealed and the utmost discretion should

be exercised in insuring the informant's security.

In line with sound intelligence practice, these informants

should normally be given test assignments to insure their reliability and

determine the extent of their cooperation. Be constantly on the alert for

possible compromise of the informant, especially if close relatives reside

in China.

...

NW 55044 DooId 32989526 Page 340

---

## Page 341

Upon selection of an informant for operation under the Chicoin

procedure, field offices should advise the Bureau in complete detail of the

plan you wish to initiate. Be certain to estimate and justify expenditure of

funds involved.

Upon receipt of Bureau approval, submit the informant's identity,

description, travel dates, and time and place of contemplated contact in a

letterhead memorandum accompanied by a photo, if available.

II. International Conferences

New York, San Francisco, and Washington Field Offices have

been forwarding to all interested offices lists of United States delegates to

international conferences attended by Chicom delegates.

The initial communication should have the dual caption "CHICOIN"

and the name and place of the conference in the title. Delete "CHICOIN"

from subsequent communications. Airtels should be used only if time

demands.

Upon receipt of identities of United States residents planning to

attend such conferences, offices involved should review indices. If the

individual is an established source, he should be contacted and instructed on

how to react to any intelligence recruitment approach and to be alert for such

approaches to others in attendance from the United States.

It is not necessary to contact other persons on these lists; how-

ever, you should note that these individuals may possess excellent potential

for future informant development.

The Bureau should be advised of all such contacts with these

established sources and should you develop a specific plan for placing them

in contact with a Chicom delegate, Bureau authority should be requested.

Should your office files contain information that an attendee has

indicated a sympathy for Communist China or would likely be susceptible

to a recruitment approach, you should open an individual case file, advise

the Bureau by airtel and accompanying letterhead memorandum, and alert

any sources who may be planning to attend the same conference.

III. Directed Correspondence to the China Mainland

Several selected sources have been corresponding with individuals

or government agencies in Communist China under Bureau direction. This

is part of a long-range program to bring our sources to the attention of

Chicom intelligence. It is aimed at promoting a personal meeting between

our sources and Chicom intelligence at some future date and offices directing

such correspondence should bear this in mind. While it is desirable to limit

the number of sources engaging in such correspondence at any one time,

all offices should be on the lookout for sources who can logically engage in

this procedure.

Bureau authority should be requested prior to initiating corres-

pondence,

In order to achieve the fullest measure of success in Chicoin,

all offices should be constantly searching for new ideas and techniques to

use in placing Bureau informants in touch with Chicom intelligence.

John Edgar Hoover

(A) FLU INOCULATION PROGRAM - 1965-66 -- Inoculations which immunize

against flu viruses for the coming fall and winter have again been recommended

by the Surgeon General, U. S. Public Health Service. Such protection is

considered especially important for persons engaged in essential occupations;

for such groups of persons at all ages who suffer from chronic debilitating

disease; older age groups; pregnant women and those in more crowded living

arrangements. Flu shots will again be available to Bureau employees on a

voluntary, cost-free basis. With the increased responsibilities placed upon

the Bureau, employees should be urged to participate in this program. Your

program should begin during September, 1965, if at all possible and should

be completed by the end of the year.

There will again be no exceptions to your ordering vaccine from

the Bureau, which is being supplied with vaccine in disposable, prefilled,

single-dose syringes by a major drug firm. These syringes permit instant

use as they contain premeasured doses and eliminate danger of cross-

contamination. The Surgeon General's Advisory Committee again recom-

mended that those vaccinated since July, 1963, need receive but a single

dose of the vaccine. When ordering, specify the total number of employees

requiring one shot and the total requiring two shots. The second shot should

be administered approximately two months after the primary shot where

applicable. Any particular vaccination problem should be resolved by the

physician selected to supervise the program. Following completion of the

program, any surplus should be returned to the Bureau. Submit

your orders

promptly.

Adult WaiTer Forma 3-343 or Minor Waiver Form 3-313a must

be presented at the time the inoculation is received. Washington Field

Office inoculations will again be handled by Seat of Gorernment. The

Imprest Fund may be used to pay for doctors' or other professional services

provided these do not exceed $100 for one day. If the charge is in excess

of this amount, submit to the Bureau in accordance with existing procedures.

Insure the doctor is well aware of the vaccine used which is again of the

Polyvalent type, as well as of the recommended number of shots and

interval between the initial and booster shots. Upon completion of the

program, promptly advise the Bureau of your (a) total personnel;

(b) number inoculated; ic) cost of doctor's fee (Bureau will have over-all

cost of vaccine). Waiver forms are not to be placed in personnel files,

but should be retained six months after which they should be destroyed.

(B) FIREARMS - PERSONALLY OWNED - .380 AUTOMATIC PISTOL --

Inasmuch as the .380 automatic pistol (or 9 millimeter short cartridge

199 foot-pounds, authority for Special Agents to carry this weapon in

lieu of service revolvers should not be granted.

8/17/65

SAC LETTER NO. 65-44

(C) ARREST AND ARRAIGNMENT - CONFESSIONS - RIGHT TO COUNSEL --

It is generally believed by judges and other observers that after the Criminal

Justice Act of 1964 takes effect on August 20, 1965, a larger percentage

of criminal defendants in the Federal courts will be represented by counsel

from the preliminary hearing forward. This prospect raises the question of

an investigator's legal and ethical right to interview a defendant, for evidence

of his own guilt, without consent of the defendant's counsel.

The Department of Justice has advised that neither the law nor

any canon of professional ethics forbids an interview with an accused, held

to obtain evidence of his own guilt, even where the accused already has

counsel and counsel is unaware that the interview is being heid. This applies

to the accused in all cases, no matter whether interviewed before arrest,

after arrest, after arrest and preliminary hearing, or after arrest and

indictment.

In each such case the canons of professional ethics do not apply

to an FBl Agent or other investigator, and the accused can waive the

presence or consent of counsel provided only that his choice to do so is

made knowingly and intelligently.

The Department suggests, however, that at the beginning of an.

interview with an accused at any stage after preliminary hearing (when

counsel probably has been appointed or retained; the interviewing Agent

should specifically inquire of the accused whether counsel has been

appointed for him or retained by him. If the answer is in the affirmative,

the accused should be told that he has the right to confer with the named

counsel before discussing his case if he wishes to do so. In other words,

his waiver of counsel retained by him or appointed for him should be a

waiver of specific counsel rather than a waiver of the right to counsel

generally as in the case of an accused who has no counsel.

SAC LETTER NO. 65-44

DooId: 32989526

Page 344

## Page 345

It also is the view of the Department that all waivers of right

to counsel and other rights, no matter the circumstances under which given,

are "preferably" obtained in writing. After the warning is given orally -

with specific mention of the right to silence as well as the right to counsel -

it can be set out in writing, dated, signed, and witnessed. The interviewer

may then proceed with the usual interview, and signed confession where

possible.

If the accused will not sign the waiver but is willing to discuss

his case, the interviewing Agents should read the waiver to him and then

witness it as having been read to him and agreed to by him orally.

No warning or waiver of rights of any kind is required for

interview of an accused for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence concerning

the guilt of someone else.

Effective immediately, you will be guided by the above instructions.

(D) CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM -- SAC Letters 64-56 (E) dated

11/17/64 and 65-10 (E) dated 3/9/65 dealt with reporting statistical accomp-

lishments attributed to informants. SAC Letter 65-10 (E) inaugurated use

of Form FD-374 for the Monthly Progress Letter to uniformly report these

statistics and compile them through use of Automatic Data Processing

equipment.

Inasmuch as statistics reported in this fashion are automatically

recorded at the Bureau, accuracy and completeness in preparing Form FD-374

are of paramount importance for appropriate credit to be given to each field

office. A six-month comparison of statistics found in active correspondence

from the field with statistics reported in the Monthly Progress Letters revealed

thirty-four field offices have failed at one time or another to incorporate all

statistics in the Monthly Progress Letters. The accumulated total of

statistics missed is impressive, i. e., twenty-eight subjects arrested in

FBI cases, twelve automobiles recovered, etc.

Although the Bureau has separately corresponded with delinquent

field offices concerning these unreported statistics, it is obvious all offices

should re-examine administrative procedures for accumulating and reporting

these statistics. Every effort should be made to eliminate inaccurate and

incomplete compilation of the Form FD-374 and, as a result, unnecessary

follow-up correspondence from the Bureau.

It is of value to every field office to obtain credit for each

statistic attributed to its informants. These statistics are recorded at the

Bureau on a monthly comparison chart which is used to evaluate the effective-

ness of the program in each field office and on a Bureau-wide basis, This

emphasis on statistics, however, should not cause any sacrifice in accuracy

and all Agents should be reminded that the field office files should clearly

document all statistics reported and attributed to informants.

(E) SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS -- The complex issues involved in both

domestic and international matters are placing an increasing daily burden

on the Bureau, particularly in regard to internal security matters, to obtain

and disseminate pertinent information at all levels of the Government. To .

date, the Bureau has been able to fulfill its responsibilities primarily because

we have developed, through unique and imaginative approaches, live sources

who are in a position to furnish us with the desired information, As the

demands upon us for information intensify, it becomes increasingly imperative

that we develop even more high-level sources familiar with all phases of the

internal security problems confronting us. In this regard, I would like to

remind you that there is no substitute for aggressive, penetrative, hard-

hitting investigative efforts aimed at the development of outstanding sources

through whom we can continue to obtain the type of information which will

enable the Bureau to stay on top of the situation in all areas of the internal

security field where we are expected and, in fact, where we have a

responsibility to be knowledgeable.

I expect you to continually stress the

value of live informant coverage and. to emphasize programs designed to

provide high-level informant coverage in all subversive groups.

(F) INVESTIGATION OF STUDENT GROUPS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES --

With the opening of the schools and colleges this fall, we can expect a

resurgence of the new radical movement which emerged on college campuses

throughout the nation during the past year. This movement has presented

the Communist Party and other subversive organizations with an opportunity

to expand their influence among youth. In order to fulfill our responsibilities

in the internal security field, we must keep abreast of the activities of these

subversive groups on college campuses.

It must be recognized, however, that we are dealing with an

extremely controversial situation; and we must conduct the necessary in-

vestigations of these groups in such a manner that the Bureau will not be

subjected to even unwarranted charges of interference with academic

freedom, invasion of privacy, and the like.

You should insure that a sound basis exists for the investigation

of the activities of any organization which is in any way connected with an

institution of learning; and Bureau authority should, of course, be obtained

before instituting any such investigation. A sharp distinction must be made

between student radicalism and unconventional views on the one hand and

subversive activities on the other. It must be made clear to all concerned

that the Bureau is interested only in persons and organizations engaged in

subversive activities on the campus and is not interested in the legitimate

activities of student groups. Because of the delicate nature of these

investigations, it is essential that we use a confidential approach and work

through established reliable sources rather than conduct open investigations

that can result in criticism. Stress must be placed on more ingenuity, more

care, and greater protective steps so that the Bureau will not be charged

with violating academic freedom or with invasion of privacy.

I wish to reiterate that personnel engaged in this work must exercise

sound mature judgment, prudence, and extreme care in conducting investi-

gations regarding subversive groups on college campuses.

originally organized in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan. Muhammad

claims to have been selected by Allah,

the Supreme Being, to

lead the so-called Negro race out of slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an independent black nation

in the United States. Members following Muhammad's teachings

and his

interpretation of the "Koran" believe there is no such

thing as a Negro; the so-called Negroes are slaves of the

white race, referred to as "white devils," in the United States;

and the white race, because of its exploitation of the so-called

Negroes, must and will be destroyed in the approaching "War of

Armageddon."

In the past, officials and members of the NOI,

including Muhammad, have refused to register under the provisions

of the Selective Service Acts and have declared that members

owe no allegiance to the United States.

On May 5, 1958, the first source advised Muhammac

had, upon advice of legal counsel, tempered his personal

• statements and instructions to his ministers concerning the

principles of his organization in order to avoid possible

prosecution by the United States Government; however, he did

had, early in July, 1958, decided to de-emphasize the religious

aspects of the teachings of Islam and to stress the economic

benefits to be derived by those Negroes who joined the NoI.

a new national larzist-oriented youth organization which would

hunt for the most peaccíul transition to socialisil. The

delogates to this meting were cautioned against the germ oi

anti-sovict and

anti-CP idcologies.

These delogaics were also

told that it would be reasonable to assume that the young

socialists attracted into this new organization would eventually

pass into the CP itself.

A second

conference of over 20 persons met in Chicago

on December 23-29, 1963, for the purpose of initiating a "call"

to the new youth organization and

planning

• for a founding

convention to be held in June, 1964.

A second source has advised thai the founding

Convention for the new youth organization vas hold during

the period of June 19-21, 1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue,

San Francisco, California, aü wich time the name W.3.B.

DuBois Clubs of America

was adopted.

Approximately 500

delegates from throughoil the United States attended this

convention.

The ains of this organization, as set forth

• in

the preamble to the constitution, are:

"It is our bolief that

this nation can best solve its probiems in an atmosphere of

peacciul co-uristence, complete disarmanent and

true freedon

for all popples of the world, and that these solucions will

be reached mainly Inrough the united efforts of all denocratic

elements in our country, composed

essentially of the working

people alliod in the unity of legroes and ocher minorities

with vhites.

We further fully recognize that the

greatest

threat to American democracy comes from the racist and right

wing forces in coalition with the nost cactionary

of the economic pover structure, using the tool of anti-

communism to divide and destroy

the unified struggle of the

worting poople.

As young people in the forces struggling

fpr democracy, vo sholl actively strive to defeat these

reactionary and neo-fascist elements and to achieve complete

freedom and

democracy for all Americans, thus enabling each

individual to freely choose and build the society he would

wish to live in.

Through these struggles we feel the American

people will realize the viability of the socialist alternatives."

The constitution further states this new organization

shall be a membership organization open to individuals or, l:

tIve or More peopic so desire, a chapter can be formed which

shall in turn be guided by the policies and principles oi the

parent

organization.

(A) U. S. SAVINGS BONDS - CHANGE IN METHOD OF DATING -- There is

enclosed Department Circular Number 677, Second Revision, Amendment

Number 10, issued by the Treasury Department on August 12, 1965.

This Circular advises of a change in rules on average-dating of

savings bonds and is self-explanatory. The primary purpose of this change

is to effect significant paper work savings by minimizing the use of the $25

bond denomination. The advantage to employees will be the possibility of an

earlier issue date for bonds of $50 or more in denominations which, of

course, creates an earlier point for the beginning of interest earnings and

an earlier maturity date.

All employees of your office should be advised of the contents

of the enclosed Circular.

and 64-52 (F).

A review of the monthly tabulation of items of criminal information

disseminated to other Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies

during July, 1965, reveals a substantial drop from the number of items

disseminated during the first month of the previous fiscal year.

While it is anticipated that the reduction represents a temporary

situation, I would like to stress at this point the importance to the Bureau,

in particular, and to law enforcement, in general, of an effective program

of mutual cooperation in this vital area. Experience has shown that the

exchange of such information not only improves the Bureau's working

relations with other investigative agencies but also frequently results in

the uncovering of criminal violations within our jurisdiction as well as theirs.

(F) VISITORS TO COMMUNIST CHINA AND CONTACTS WITH CHINESE

COMMUNIST DIPLOMATIC ESTABLISHMENTS -- In connection with the

Bureau's intensified efforts to cover Chinese communist activities in the

United States, arrangements have been made with other U. S. intelligence

agencies, as well as with friendly foreign intelligence services, to provide

the Bureau with the identities of U. S. residents (either citizens or resident

aliens) who have traveled to Communist China or plan such travel or who

have been in contact with Chinese communist diplomatic establishments

abroad. Other U. S. agencies, as well as Western intelligence services,

are sharply accelerating coverage of Chinese intelligence activities abroad

and the Bureau has already started to receive the identities of U. S.

citizens and resident aliens visiting Communist China or in contact with

Chinese communist establishments overseas.

With regard to individuals in contact with Chinese communist

diplomatic establishments abroad, you should follow the same procedures

and investigative policies as are applicable to contacts with Soviet and

satellite establishments abroad (set forth in Section 105K, pages 22a - 29,

of the Manual of Instructions). Bureau authority should be obtained prior

to interviews of subjects in such cases. With regard to visits by U. S.

citizens and resident aliens to Communist China, in view of the restrictions

on travel to Red China and in view of the pronounced and violent anti-U. S.

attitude of the Chinese Communist Government, such visits raise a strong

suspicion of subversive activity in the absence of special circumstances.

We know from Chinese communist defectors that the Chinese communist

intelligence services often seek to recruit persons for intelligence purposes

during visits to the Chinese Mainland. Therefore, these cases should be

thoroughly investigated and analyzed to resolve whether the individual in

question is serving as a Chinese intelligence agent or may be otherwise

acting on behalf of Red China. In addition, the objectives of these cases

include the possible development of informants and sources, the acquisition

of positive intelligence data concerning Communist China, and the prompt

notification to other interested U. S. and friendly foreign intelligence

services of information of interest. As soon as information is received

indicating that a U. S. citizen or resident alien has traveled to Communist

• China or plans such travel, an investigation should be initiated to develop

pertinent background data, including current residence and employment,

and whether the individual has access to classified information. . Passport

records of the Department of State should be checked at the outset of such

investigations to ascertain whether the individual has a passport validated

for travel to Communist China. As soon as this is determined, pertinent

information should be submitted to the Bureau in a letterhead memorandum

to facilitate advice to interested U. S. and friendly foreign agencies.

If the individual in question has a valid passport for travel to

Communist China, no further investigation should be conducted. Otherwise,

appropriate security informants should be contacted and logical inquiries

made to determine the reason for the travel and consideration should be

given to an interview of the subject. Bureau authority is necessary prior

to such interviews. Appropriate manual changes are being prepared.

(A) CHANGE IN AIR FORCE OFFICER SERIAL NUMBERS -- The Depart-

will remain unchanged, but the letter prefixes will be changed to FR for

(B) AIRLINE TRAVEL - FREE BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE - GTRS - At

the present time, certain United States scheduled airlines have received

approval for increasing the free baggage allowance for travel solely within

the United States and/or Canada. These changes are not applicable to

international travel nor to any domestic portions of international travel.

For those airline carriers who have received approval for the change in

baggage allowance the new concept is generally as follows:

Checked Baggage - One piece of baggage not to exceed 62 inches

in total dimensions plus one additional piece of baggage not to

exceed 55 inches in total dimensions. Any article exceeding

36 x 26 x 18 inches in total dimension will not be accepted as

baggage.

Unchecked Baggage - One or more pieces of baggage which, if

measured together as one piece, do not exceed 45 inches in

total dimensions; provided that such additional pieces) of

baggage are carried on board the aircraft, retained in the

passenger's custody, and capable of being stowed under the

passenger's seat.

\ N: 55044

_Docid: 32989526

Page_ 375

---

## Page 376

Note: The above dimensions for both checked and unchecked

baggage are the sum of the length, width, and height of

the article(s).

Charges for extra or over-sized pieces are as follows:

Adult one-way

Jet Coach Fare

Charge for each

extra or over-sized piece

$ 25.00 or under

25.01 - $ 50.00

50.01 - 120.00

120.01 - 200.00

over $200.00

$2.00

3.00

4.00

5.00

6.00

In addition to the above modifications involving free baggage

allowance, some airline carriers have elected to remain under the weight

concept for baggage but have received approval from the Civil Aeronautics

Board to increase the free baggage allowance from 40 to 50 pounds.

In view of these changes, it will be necessary to determine in

each instance the type of free baggage allowance offered by the carrier to

be used to insure the proper preparation of the Government Transportation

Request. Generally, charges for excess baggage are handled by the various

airlines on Government Excess Baggage Authorization forms and airlines

are modifying these forms to correspond with the above-described changes

in baggage allowance. However, in those instances where a Government

Transportation Request is issued to cover transportation and/or charges

for extra baggage, and transportation is to be procured from an airline

which operates under the pieces concept for baggage allowance, entries

on the Government Transportation Request should be made in accordance

with the following:

1. Where the extra or over-sized baggage is to be transported

between points the • entire service for which is furnished

by the carrier honoring the transportation request, there

should be entered in the space on the transportation request

following the words "transport not over" the number of pieces

of extra or over-sized baggage. Also, the abbreviation "Ibs."

should be deleted and word "pieces" inserted in lieu thereof.

2. Where the extra or over-sized baggage is to be transported

between points, the service for which is furnished by

more than one carrier and the excess baggage allowance

concept is different as to the carriers involved, there

should be entered in the space on the transportation request .

following the words "transport not over" the words "see

reverse." On the reverse of the transportation request in

the space reserved to further identify services required

there should be entered the number of pieces of extra or

over-sized baggage, the points between which it will move,

and the carrier(s) that will furnish the service.

These changes in the free baggage allowance by the airline carriers

do not remove the requirement that all charges involving excess baggage be

completely justified by the traveler. This matter should be brought to the

attention of all personnel in your office who have occasion to issue Government

Transportation Requests.

(E) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) - DOMESTIC CONTACT

SERVICE - You previously have been informed regarding CIA's Contact

Division which has had offices in various U. S. cities and which is openly

identified as being connected with CIA. This division has been responsible

for the overt collection of positive intelligence gained through interviews of

aliens, travelers, businessmen, etc. The division has not been engaged

in any operational activity such as the development of double agents. For

your information, CIA has reorganized this division and it is now called

the Domestic Contact Service.

An examination of CIA's activities in the area of overt collection

of positive intelligence has indicated that the Bureau can strengthen its

position by having our field offices establish direct contact with the local

offices of the Domestic Contact Service. This particularly applies to those

situations where the Bureau and CIA both have an interest in Soviet-bloc

and Yugoslav nationals, excluding those who are connected with embassies

or the. United Nations.

We recognize that CIA has a responsibility for

collection of positive intelligence (i. e. information regarding Soviet-bloc

capability in a particular research field) which might be acquired from

such visitors but we cannot condone any CIA activity which might

interfere with Bureau operations. You therefore are authorized to

establish liaison with local offices of the Domestic Contact Service.

In each case when you initiate any inquiry or investigation of a visiting

Soviet-bloc national, you should obtain from the local Domestic Contact

Service the nature and extent of CIA interest and all pertinent information

which CIA has gained or may acquire in the future relating to our internal

security responsibilities. If you feel that CIA activity conflicts with

Bureau objectives, you should so advise the Seat of Government, clearly

setting forth your reasons. In this connection, there may be instances

where continuing CIA pursuit of positive intelligence would conflict with

the Bureau's discharge of its internal security functions.

(B) LAW ENFORCEMENT CONFERENCES, 1965 - RESPONSIBILITIES OF

LAW ENFORCEMENT IN 1965 --Law Enforcement Conferences in 1965 will

concern facets of the tremendous responsibilities facing all levels of law

enforcement at the present, and how the profession can better equip itself

to handle those responsibilities. Conferences should be held during October

and November, 1965; schedule sufficient conferences to adequately cover

your territory; wherever possible, utilize sites that are readily accessible

to law enforcement and other's invited to your conferences. Inform adjacent

offices of your conference plans; border offices may invite friendly foreign

law enforcement personnel. Conference agenda should be limited to four

to six hours, should be of the open-forum type, with audience participation

encouraged, Qualified representatives from local and state law enforcement

may be utilized as panelists; names of such people should be checked through

your files and the Bureau advised of the results prior to their being invited.

Attendance of undesirables should be avoided and representatives of com-

mercial concerns should not be invited.

You are authorized to prepare and forward friendly but business-

like circular letters of invitation to those agencies and individuals included on

your law enforcement mailing list. Bureau will issue a national press release

r'egarding these conferences; you should make no local press releases regarding

them until authorized by the Bureau.

## Page 382

Agenda of your proposed conferences, listing speakers to be in-

vited, as well as dates and sites, should be submitted to the Bureau on a UACB

basis at least ten days before your first conference. Conferences should be

closed to all but duly constituted law enforcement representatives and those

having a bona fide connection with the administration of criminal justice.

Designate a period, either immediately before or after each conference, to be

open to news media representatives, during which you should explain the pur-

poses and general format of your conferences; interest of news media should

be encouraged.

Material for distribution at your conferences, such as Law

Enforcement Bulletin reprints, booklets, etc., should be ordered by routing

slip from Crime Records Division as early as possible. For economy reasons,

Bureau will be unable to prepare special posters or displays; do not incur

expenses for rental of space, etc., without prior Bureau authority.

Set forth hereafter is a suggested agenda; you should preside at

ach conference personally.

I. Opening Remarks ..

By SAC; should set tenor of conference; problems besetting

law enforcement such as constantly rising crime rate, public apathy; interest

of Federal Government in developing all law enforcement resources;

President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice;

Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 1965; no simple solution.

II. Improving and Maintaining Law Enforcement's Public Image

May be presented by carefully selected panel comprised of

competent municipal, state and Federal law enforcement representatives.

Advance importance of law enforcement activities having effect on good public

relations; courtesy, physical appearance of personnel, periodic police agency

reports, press releases, speeches by departmental representatives, training

programs (departmental, state programs, FBI National Academy, FBI field

assistance), unnecessary use of force, promotions based on merit, programs

to elicit cooperation of public, not only be right, but look right, etc.

Advent of the computer (Bureau will forward available data);

the law enforcement laboratory and the identification bureau; where and how

such aids are available; common problems encountered by law enforcement

in obtaining maximum utilization of scientific aids (proper collection,

identification, preservation and forwarding of evidence). Remarks should

not concern services of FBI Laboratory and Identification Division exclusively,

but Bureau's interests should be tactfully advanced. Consider use of case

examples.

IV. Cooperation -- The Backbone of Effective Law Enforcement

• Consider use of panel, including FBI representative.

Importance of all levels of law enforcement presenting unified front against

lawless; prompt referral between agencies; use of services of other agencies

where available (Bureau representative should tactfully advance desirability

of prompt referral of matters within Bureau's investigative jurisdiction; use

of Unlawful Flight assistance, etc.).

• V. Summation by SAC

Within a week following your last conference, advise Bureau

of results of all conferences, giving total number in attendance, number of

agencies represented, dates and places where conferences were held and total

number of conferences completed. Summary letter should contain specific

statements of interest by those in attendance, as well as all suggestions for

the improvement of law enforcement conferences. Forward to Bureau only

sampling of newspaper publicity received, and any unusual publicity items

noted. Correspondence regarding conferences should be directed to attention

(A) FEDERAL EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE

PROGRAM -- Reference SAC Letter 65-36 of 6-29-65. Civil Service

Commission is taking steps to develop captioned program as a part of

which there would be a sharing of employee health services by agencies

in a given locality. Personnel of your office and of certain Resident

Agencies may be contacted by other agencies for completion of

questionnaires prepared by the Commission in conducting surveys

incident to this matter.

Bureau has taken steps to be excluded from the proposed

program since the Commission proposal incorporates the same

disadvantages as the proposal outlined in referenced SAC Letter.

Accordingly, should Bureau personnel be approached by representatives

of other agencies as to the initial survey or as to possible interest in

participation, inquirers should be advised Bureau does not plan to

participate in such a program. Bureau should be kept informed of any

developments in this program coming to your attention.

(B) "THE STORY OF THE F. B.I." - WONDER BOOKS SERIES FOR

CHILDREN -- The publishers have released the children's book on the

FBI entitled "The Story of the F. B.I." This is a well-written, informative

book which emphasizes the Bureau's dedication to the preservation of

America's freedoms. It is 48 pages in length and contains some 60

photographs illustrating the overall work of the FBI. It has a striking red

cover on which is a picture depicting a hand displaying an FBI badge.

As a result of contacts made with the publishers, this book is

being made available to the FBI Recreation Association at a reduced price,

thereby making it possible to offer it to our employees at $. 50 per copy.

• The Crime Records Division will handle the distribution of this book.

You should canvass the employees in your office to determine

the number who are interested in purchasing this book at the reduced

price. Each field office should submit its order, along with one check

covering the total order in your office figured at $. 50 per copy, by routing slip

to the Crime Records Division. This check should be made payable to the

"FBIRA."

Since a number of employees have already indicated an interest in

purchasing this book as a Christmas gift for young people, orders requiring

delivery before Christmas should reach the Bureau no later than November 8,

1965.

Regular orders can be submitted any time after this date.

(D) SPECIAL SEMINAR OF UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS ON ORGANIZED

CRIME - CRININAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM -- On October 11, 1965,

a special seminar of United States Attorneys on organized crime was held

at the Department of Justice which was attended by approximately 15 United

States Attorneys from key organized crime offices and by representatives

of the Department and the Bureau.

Some of the United States Attorneys present at this meeting

indicated a feeling they should more actively coordinate and direct

investigative activities concerning organized crime matters. They stated

that because of the difference in organized crime cases distinguishing them

from ordinary criminal violations the United States Attorneys should be

furnished with all of the raw detailed information which is supplied by

informants and highly confidential sources in order that they would be in

a position to spearhead and direct the Criminal Intelligence Program.

In view of this indicated desire by these United States Attorneys

to assume authority over organized crime investigations and to direct the

conduct of investigative cases, Bureau representative at this point

reasserted the FBI's responsibility for maintaining the control and

direction of cases within our jurisdiction. It was pointed out that the

Bureau has the primary responsibility in its investigations just as the

United States Attorneys are responsible for matters involving prosecution

and that the Special Agents in Charge of our respective offices would not

be permitted to relinquish the direction of our organized crime investigations

to any outside agency, including United States Attorneys. With respect to

the observations as to information from all sources being included in reports,

your attention is called to previous instructions issued by the Bureau that

information received from highly confidential sources is not to be set forth

in investigative reports in the Criminal Intelligence Program. These

instructions are still in effect and you should continue to follow them in

the preparation of reports in this category.

It was emphasized at the seminar that in organized crime matters

we would be glad to conduct any additional logical investigation which United

States Attorneys might desire in a given case or to discuss with them at any

time any situations which might arise in connection with a particular case

under investigation.

and to assure you remain aware to the necessity for insuring that there is

no encroachment on the Bureau's responsibility for the over-all direction

of our organized crime investigations.

Each Special Agent in Charge must follow this matter very closely

and promptly advise the Bureau of any developments of significance coming to

your attention in this regard.

(A) /CORRECTING ERRORS IN COMMUNICATIONS -- Several recent

instances have been noted at the Bureau of field offices ignoring provisions

of the Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 4(P), Page 60.

It is reiterated that amended pages of a communication are not to be sent

to outside agencies. Corrections are to be brought to the attention of out-

side agencies by letter and then only when necessary to clarity the sub-

stance and meaning of the information previously disseminated. This

Section also provides for the SAC to take the initiative in fixing the

responsibility, obtaining explanations and recommending administrative

action when substantive errors are detected by the field.

You are aware of my desire for communications directed out-

side the Bureau to be free from error. Every reasonable step should be

taken to insure that the individual who dictates a communication has an

opportunity to proofread it prior to dissemination. Supervisory personnel

must also increase their efforts to detect evident errors. When corrections

are necessary, you will be expected, in the future, to comply with the

regulations cited abore.

(B) LIAISON WITH U. S. SECRET SERVICE -- Secret Service Headquarters

notification will include times of arrival, departure and routes of motor-

cade, including a route map if available.

This will be done to keep the

Bureau advised of the Secret Service plans involving Presidential travel.

Upon receipt of such travel information you should advise

all Agents and insure that any information in their possession as to location

and pertinent actions of security and other subjects of interest to Secret

Service has been disseminated to that Agency.

(C) BUREAU APPLICANTS - RECRUITMENT PROGRAM - SELECTIVE

SERVICE STATUS -- SAC Letter 65-38 authorized the field to utilize SSS

Form 725 (March 10, 1965) prepared by the Selective Service System, which

is authorization by the registrant for release of information contained in his

Selective Service records. Any question concerning the availability of

Selective Service records should be resolved by having applicant execute

above release.

Due to the increased quotas being placed on local draft boards

because of the situation in Viet Nam, prior to instituting an investigation on

a male clerical applicant registered by Selective Service, you must now

check his draft board to determine his current classification and tentative

induction date. This will prevent unnecessary expenditure of manpower in

those instances where applicant is subject to immediate induction.

Induction

quotas given to draft boards are always subject to change necessitating

revision in draft board policy; however, if at all possible, projected date of

induction should be determined.

If applicant has student deferment and is being considered for

employment at Seat of Government, it should be ascertained if he will be

continued in student classification if he moves to the Washington, D. C.,

area with the intention of attending school while working full time, It has

been noted some colieges will not allow a student who is employed full time

to carry more than 12 semester hours of study. Also, some draft boards

will not consider registrants for student deferment who are rot enrolled as

full-time students. General policy in the Washington, D. C., area is a

student employed full time is not allowed to carry more than 12 semester

hours of study. Although the Bureau does request occupational deferments

for Special Agent personnel, it will not request occupational deferments

for clerical personnel.

As you have been previously advised, if a Special Agent

applicant has had no prior military service, his status must be completely

resolved prior to arranging his physical examination. If he is immediately

available for military service or has been deferred or rejected from military

service because of his attendance at school, critical occupation, physical

defects), etc., it is necessary to contact his board at the outset to determine

if an occupational deferment would be granted the applicant if offered an

appointment as a Special Agent. If the applicant has been deferred or rejected

because of physical defect(s), he should be informed that he may also be

disqualified for Bureau employment and it will be incumbent upon him to

bring this information to the attention of the examining facility so that a

complete evaluation can be made as to his prior medical history. This

policy should now be extended to include the processing of male clerical

applicants, exclusive of determining whether an occupational deferment

will be granted. Clerical applicants should bring pertinent medical infor-

mation to the attention of their own personal physicians for their evaluation.

If there is any doubt as to whether or not the applicant should

be processed for employment, it should be immediately referred to the

Bureau. All information secured from draft board records must be

reported on FD-263 (Cover Page). See Manual of Rules and Regulations,

Part Il, Section 4, C 18.

(D) CHRISTMAS POST OFFICE FRAUD CASES - FRAUD AGAINST THE

GOVERNMENT -- Establish immediate liaison with local postal inspectors

in line with previous years (SAC Letter 64-56G) to assure prompt referrals

of indicated false statements in applications for temporary Christmas

employment. In view of numerous retirements by the end of December,

1965, which will seriously reduce the permanent employees of the Post

Office Department, it is expected that post offices will employ many

temporary Christmas employees to meet their obligations during the coming

Christmas season.

Insure that the United States Attorney is given all pertinent

facts including the point that these are not merely a series of isolated frauds

but in the aggregate cause considerable expense to the Government through

costs of investigating applicants and consequent need for recruiting replace-

ments. In addition, the danger to the integrity of the mails through the

hiring of criminals for such jobs is obvious.

The United States Attorneys' Manual, Title II, Page 68, urges

vigorous prosecution of wilful falsification or concealment of facts material

to employment of applicants for positions with the Federal Government.

These cases must be given vigorous, thorough and careful

investigative attention by all offices. Although streamlined procedures are

desirable to insure efficient handling of these cases, they should not be

(E) MOTOR VEHICLE SEAT BELT ACT -- Reference is made to SAC

Letter Number 64-26, dated 5/19/64, wherein you were advised of the

provisions of new legislation (Public Law 88-201) dealing with minimum

standards for seat belts for use in motor vehicles.

The Secretary of Commerce published in the Federal Register

dated 12/11/64, the standards for seat belts as required by Public Law

88-201. He set out the effective date for the criminal provisions as one

year after the date of publication in the Federal Register. These criminal

provisions will therefore be effective 12/11/65.

The Justice Department has now advised that the Commerce

Department, through the National Bureau of Standards, will conduct all

necessary scientific and technical tests. Commerce has informed Justice

it will work out routine inspection procedures for the spot checking or

sampling of seat belts.

The Bureau has pointed out to the Department that as this

law is regulatory, with responsibility for setting up standards and

testing placed with the Commerce Department, complainants alleging defective

seat belts will be referred to the Commerce Department. The Bureau

also informed the Department of Justice that no investigation will be

instituted by the FBI until Commerce advises Justice its tests reveal that

its standards have not been met and the Justice Department specifically

requests the FBI to initiate investigation. The Department has agreed this

procedure should be followed and has informed that all U. S. Attorneys

are being so instructed.

In line with the above, all complainants under this legislation

are to be referred to the Commerce Department and no investigation is

to be initiated except upon specific instructions from the Justice Department

through the Bureau.

(F) CHINESE COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE BIOGRAPHICAL DATA

ALBUM -- In order to concentrate our investigative efforts on those persons

who are most likely to be involved in Chinese communist (Chicom) intelligence

activities and to provide an aid in identifying contacts of Chicom intelligence,

a Chinese Communist Intelligence Biographical Data Album is being estab-

lished at Seat of Government to catalog all known, probable and possible

Chicom intelligence agents by name and description. Albums are also

to be maintained at New York, Newark, New Haven, Washington Field,

Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, El Paso and

Tokyo offices.

Each office should immediately review pending and closed cases

concerning individuals possibly involved in Chicom intelligence activities

and evaluate each case considering the following factors:

KNOWN INTELLIGENCE AGENTS

A. Subjects have been identified by reliable sources or in-

vestigation as having conducted intelligence assignments for the Chicoms

and the nature of the assignment is known.

B. Employees of the Chinese Communist Government whose

activities are such that it is evident they are engaged in intelligence activities.

PROBABLE OR POSSIBLE INTELLIGENCE AGENTS

A. Persons identified by sources of unknown reliability as

engaged in Chicom intelligence where there appears to be a basis in fact

for the allegation.

B. Persons identified by reliable sources as having some

undetermined relationship with the Chicoms.

C. Persons who receive funds from Communist China.

D. Persons who have considerable contact or who associate

closely with Chicoms, particularly with Chicom intelligence personnel.

E. Persons who are known to be in sympathy with the Chicoms.

F. Persons who receive business favors or other gratuities

from the Chicoms.

G. Persons in written contact with Communist China or

Chicom diplomatic establishments, particularly where it appears that

cryptic phraseology is in use.

H. Persons who travel to Communist China for unexplained

reasons.

I. U. S. citizens who have returned to this country after

residence in Communist China.

J. Individuals in the U. S. under false documents.

K. Subjects who, during interview, provide information in-

consistent with known facts or with previously furnished information, giving

the impression of attempting to conceal areas of their background.

It is recognized that none of these factors considered individually

are sufficient to denote a person as a probable Chicom intelligence agent.

They should be considered as part of an accumulation of evidence or logical

indicators of intelligence activity.

After review of these cases, submit a letter with the dual

caption "Chinese Communist Intelligence Biographical Data Album, Internal

Security - China" and the subject's individual case title. Set forth the

subject's residence, employment, description and briefly summarize your

reasons for recommending the subject for this album. Also enclose 14

current photographs of the subject.

The decision to include a subject in the album will be made at

Seat of Government, after which appropriate communications and photographs

will be forwarded to those offices maintaining duplicate albums, including

Quantico, with appropriate categorizing. Each office will be advised of the

results of the Bureau's action on recommendations concerning its subjects.

Also included in this album will be known Chicom intelligence

agents in Canada, Mexico and residents of other areas who have been known

to travel into the U. S.

Do not restrict case review to subjects of Chinese origin, but

be particularly attentive to persons active in subversive groups following

the Chinese communist line or who are already on the Security Index for

pro-Chicom sentiments.

made to obtain handwriting specimens, fingerprints and minutely detailed

descriptive data.

This album will be in continuing operation and cases concerning

Chinese security matters should be constantly evaluated in relationship to

the album.

RE:

MICROPHONE INSTALLATIONS -

COMMON WALL PENETRATION

Penetration of a common wall between two buildings or

between two rooms within the same building for the purpose of

establishing a microphone surveillance is a well-established

technique. Where physical conditions are such that access can

be had to a common wall of the target area,

be thoroughly explored

and given consideration as a means of

securing desired microphone coverage. Common wall penetration

is particularly adaptable to those conditions where access to an

area to be afforded microphone coverage is not possible or where

peculiar security problems preclude the use of more direct methods

available for installation of concealed

microphones.

No survey

made for the purpose of determining feasibility of installing

a concealed microphone can be considered complete until the

possibility of utilization of this technique has been fully.

explored.

Careful analysis of each

condition encountered will

reveal that in most instances penetration of a common wall can

be achieved without benefit of specialized tools or sophisticated

drilling equipment.

The particular approach and solution to each

individual common wall penetration problem will depend largely

upon the ingenuity and fortitude of the individuals making the

microphone installation.

In some situations, due to the nature

of materials

used in wall construction, thickness of walls or

unusual security problems the need for

specialized equipment

to facilitate wall penetration may be indicated. Should a

survey for microphone installation reveal that the latter

condition exists, you should submit specific details to the

Bureau, attention of the Laboratory. Analysis of details may

enable

the

Laboratory to supply you

with drilling tools or

devices which will facilitate penetration of the particular

common wall in question.

(A) . PERSONNEL MATTERS - FLOWER FUNDS -- SAC Letter 60-24

dated 5-10-60 authorized all field and Seat of Government

divisions to maintain a flower fund on a voluntary basis.

Disbursements were to be confined to the purposes for which

the fund was established, such as to purchase flowers or

appropriate gift for employees in case of illness and to provide

flowers to immediate families of employees when a death occurs.

The fund is not to be utilized to purchase a gift for an

employee who resigns or is transferred. Bylaws or other

administrative devices with reference to the fund were to

be amended to comply with these instructions. SAC Letter

61-8 dated 2-21-61 called attention to the above instructions

regarding proper use of the flower fund and instructed that

there be no collections for birthdays, showers, baby and

wedding gifts, transfers, resignations and the like.

Further-

more, contributions to the flower fund should be strictly

volurtary and held to an absolute minimum. Each field and

Seat of Government division is to promptly advise the Bureau

whether these instructions are being complied with or submit

explanation for any deviation.

Two copies of the bylaws of

the flower fund should be submitted. Also advise whether any

other fund exists from which similar expenditures are being

made and, if so, identify the fund and submit two copies of

the bylaws.

Results should be submitted by airtel directed

to the attention of the Personnel Section and should reach

the Bureau within three days of receipt of this letter.

(C): IDENTIFICATION MATTERS - LATENT FINGERPRINT MATTERS - - The

following devices and materials available on the market and

advertised for use in connection with developing and recording

latent-fingerprints have been evaluated in the Identification

Division.

The results are being furnished for information of

all Agents and should be of particular interest to personnel

handling police schools:

"ID Fingerprint Powder" (Spray Powder)

This is essentially a fingerprint powder packaged in

an aerosol can similar to those used for household insecticides,

the powder being blown onto the surface. The entire surface is

coated and then brushed to reveal the latent prints. The gray

powder tested compared favorably with ordinary gray powder.

The black powder does not produce as good a visual contrast

as

ordinary black powder. The sole advantage noted was its rapid

application to large areas. Disadvantages are the danger of

overcoating; powder sometimes issues in clumps or drops which

will not brush off; powder settles on everything in an eight-

to ten-foot radius in inside use; and would obviously be more

expensive than regular powder to

use.

"Magna Brush"

This is a device for applying magnetic fingerprint

powder with a magnetic pencil instead of

a brush. The pencil

comes in a kit with four small bottles of powder. It cannot

be used on iron or steel and due to the manner of application

its use would be limited to small areas.

Tests show that it

will not perform any better than ordinary powders.

Application of Fingerprint Powder with Cotton

When exceptionally large surfaces are to be examined,

the application of fingerprint powder by

means of a wad of cotton

nay speed the

job. A handful of cotton (obtainable in one pound

017s should be torn from a roll so that it has a raged wisp

edge.

This is used in the manner of a fingerprint brush by

dipping the wad of cotton into a layer of fingerprint powder

which has been spread out on paper and then dusting the powder

over the surface.

No pressure is to be exerted on the cotton

Any latant impressions made visible

during thi,cleaned up" with a fingerprint brush, not with the

should be

cotton. This technique should be used only on large areas and is

in no way meant to displace the routine application of powder with

the brush.

This information does not alter the long-standing

prohibition against wrapping latent-bearing surfaces in cotton

or cloth for shipment.

Etching Latent Prints on Glass with Hydrofluoric Acia

This process requires specially constructed equipment

and a laboratory nood to dispose oi escaping vapor.

A rather

detailed experimental report on this method shows that

its

success is dependent on the type of glass, the rate of etching

is difficult to predict or control, requires two to six hours'

exposure to acid vapor, "and the results at best are not better

than those achieved by

the use of photography or fingerprint

powder. This is a laboratory novelty.

"Foto-Focuser"

This is a metal attachment for fastening to the lens of

a 4 x 5 inch "Graphic"

camera to photograph latent prints natural

size, as is done with the fingerprint camera.

With the bellows

properly adjusted, a latent print is in correct focus when it is

flush with the end of the

"Focuser."

It has been suggested

that

this device would make the fingerprint camera unnecessary. A

"Graphic" camera with the

"Focuser" does not, of course,

equal

the fingerprint canera in simplicity and

ease of operation.

Some of the disadvantages found in the use of this device are

constant slippage of the track lock when pressure is applied to

hold the camera against a latent print, the obscuring of a

sizable margin of the negative by the edges of the

"Focuser";

excessive length and weight of the camera unit--21 1/2 inches

and 8 pounds compared to 12 inches and 6 pounds for the finger-

print camera; exposures are all flash shots with over-exposure

probable if made in ordinary room illumination or brighter light;

extra expense of larger film and flash bulbs.

Possible Adaptation of Polaroid Camera to Fingerprint Work

Polaroid photographs do not show the sharp detail

obtainable by conventional photographic methods. Test shots of

inked fingerprints made with this camera do not

show good ridge

definition.

(G). FEDERAL BANK ROBBERY AND INCIDENTAL CRIMES STATUTE-NIGHT

DEPOSITORY THEFTS - In the past, United States Attorneys

have rendered divergent opinions as to whether a theft from

a bank night depository constitutes a violation of the Federal

(Bank Robbery and Incidental Crimes Statute.

This divergency

of opinion often stemmed from the crucial question of whether

deposits so made were within the care, custody and control of

the bank.

In most instances final determination hinged on the

contractual relationship existing between the depositor and

the bank.

United States

Attorney's Bulletin, Volume 10, Number 6,

dated March 23, 1962, states that, though the issue is not free

from doubt in that there have been no test cases in the higher

courts, thefts fron bank night depositories are a violation of the

statute regardless of the contractual relationship between the

bank and the depositor.

The view expressed resolves the question

of care, custody and control with the comment that a bailment

relationship is established between the depositor and the bank at

the time the deposit is made.

The element of notice to the bank,

necessary for this bailment,

is presumed since the bank in

providing the night depository facility invites its use.

(H) CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM - NECESSITY OF AFFORDING PROTECTION

TO HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS AND TECHNIQUES - It is

mandatory that our highly confidential informants and techniques

are afforded complete protection at all times.

When

attributing

information to these sources, care must be exercised in order that

our operations are not impaired through the divulgence of their

identities.

In this regard, there has been a tendency by some field

offices when reporting information from these sources to submit

plain text rather than encoded teletypes. In those instances

when information is reported which could compromise our informants,

your teletypes must be encoded to insure adequate protection is

afforded our sources and their identities are not disclosed under

any circumstances.

The importance of protecting our informants also applies

to data attributed to confidential sources which is set forth in

your reports and memoranda. It is

of paramount importance in

preparing material which is disseminated to other agencies that

meticulous care be taken to afford these informants maximum

protection by appropriately paraphrasing the material contained

therein.

You should follow this closely in your office in order

that this is properly handled in all material prepared by you

(C) FEDERAL LAW ON SEARCH AND SEIZURE - TRAINING DOCUMENT #61 --

Captioned training document will be distributed

I to all offices

In the near future. It will serve two purposes. First, it

will provide the recessary text for use by those law-trained

Special Agents in your office who are designated to discuss the

subject of search and seizure before police school groups.

Second, and perhaps more important, it will give all investiga-

tive personnel a ready source.of information on what the Federal

law does and does not permit by way of search and seizure in a

case under investigation.

You are to maintain this training document in such a

manner that it is readily available at all times for both of its

intended uses.

Copies may be charged out to Special Agents and

they may be kept in Resident Agencies.

You will note that the

document contains no classified information and no references to

Bureau policy. The entire text is a matter of law only.

You should encourage the investigative personnel of

your office to use this training document as a source of infor-

mation on handling search and seizure problems in their cases,

and to be sufficiently familiar with its contents that they fully

understand the principal points of law involved. This training

document should be viewed not as something to be put on the shelf

and consulted infrequently but as a statement of the principles

of law with which every Special Agent should be fully familiar

at all times.

(D) SUPPLIES - PURCHASES FROM GENERAI SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

RETAIL STORES -- The General Services Administration (GSA) has

opened Interagency Retail Stores in selected cities throughout •

the continental United States.

These are self-service stores

stocking approximately 1,200 administrative supply items and some

standard forms. These retail stores do not in any way replace

regular agency

requirements which are met through submission of

purchase orders at regular intervals. The retail stores are

primarily to meet emergency needs for standard supply items

which otherwise might be purchased in the open market

at much

higher prices.

The few retail stores now in operation have proven

very successful in effecting important economies throughout the

Government. The opening of more such stores may be expected in

the near future. Should GSA inquire of your office as to the

Interest of the Bureau in these stores, to determine the feasibility

of setting up a store to serve Government needs in your locality,

you should advise them that the Bureau would participate to the

degree that emergency purchases only would be made in this manner.

The retäil stores operate in much the same manner as a

self-service supermarket. Using a charge-plate, for identification

and billing, the purchaser will select items required, exit past a

checkout clerk who will register the cost of each item purchased.

In the event retail stores are opened in your GSA region,

your office would be advised by OSA direct, together with instruc-

tions regarding the obtaining of the charge-plate.

The Bureau

must insist that the charge-plate issued be used only for identifi-

cation, not for charging items. Cash payment from your imprest

fund is authorized.

Purchases made in this manner should be re-

stricted to emergency requirements.

The submission of quarterly

requirements to the Bureau, through the purchase order forms, remains

unchanged.

(E) SOLAR RESEARCH CORPORATION - 3200 N.E. 12TH AVENUE - OAKLAND

Corporation advertises itself as a

manufacturer of "special security

and intelligence devices.

Principal items of

equipment are those

used for concealed listening devices

(bugs), wire tapping ano

recording, most of which have been displayed to the Bureau.

Holcomb advises company will sell only to duly constituted

law

enforcement agencies on presentation of official orders and pay-

ment vouchers.

He states the company intends to hold bugging and

wire-tapping school for selected police officers in the Spring of

1962. He claims his considerable experience is the basis of material

used

to prepare detailed, illustrated manuals on how to install,

operate and record bugs and wire taps with the company's equipment.

He has solicited the Bureau's opinion of Solar equipment

and whether its production and sale to police agencies would interfere

with Bureau operations.

The Bureau has advised him it expresses no

opinion on merit of equipment, does not endorse or recommend any

particular product or company, and in no way indicates to any

organization what products should or should not be produced.

Holcomb has been instructed that neither he nor his company

to indicate the Bureau is interested in Solar products nor are

they to use the Bureau's name to promote sales of their equipment.

In addition to his own admission, Bureau records show

that in 1955 Holcomb was acquitted by a Los Angeles County jury

on charges of wire tapping in a divorce case for lack of specific

evidence as to who actually did the tapping. Two codefendants,

on Holcomb's acquittal, changed their pleas

from guilty to not

In 1956 he offered his.

services to the police department' is an auxiliary police officer

at Oakland Park, Florida, and has

used his equipment to assist

local police departments

and sheriffs' offices in that area.

Any dealing with Holcomb or any individual or company

selling Solar products should be most circumspect. In no event

should it be indicated that the Bureau is interested in Solar

products except for the purpose of keeping abreast of new

developments in the law enforcement field.

Any use of the Bureau's

name

to promote

Solar sales should be promptly reported.

¿ Interviews in false report cases under the Destruction of Aircraft

or Motor Vehicles Statute must be searching and thorough to insure

that all pertinent facts are developed with regard to the circum-

stances of the threat.

¡This 1s particularly important, for example, in a case

where the

subject alleges he was only joking when he falsely claimed

to have a

bomb as he was about to board an aircraft. The circum-

stances under which he made the false statement may have warranted

a person who heard the statement to infer that the subject intended

to convey the idea that his purpose was to damage or destroy an

aircraft. The intent, which must be considered as an element of

this offense, is not

the frame of mind claimed by the subject, but

that which must be attributed to him as a result of the natural

import of his words and the face value of his actions.

Information concerning the reaction of witnesses to the

subject's false statement is necessary for the United States

Attorney and the Department to enable them to make prompt decisions

as to prosecution.

(C). AUTOMOBILES - TWO-WAY FM MOBILE RADIOS -- SAC Letter 57-40,

dated July 9, 1957, pointed out the possibilities of explosion

and fire in the trunk of an automobile due to the ignition of

accumulated gasoline fumes by a spark from a

two-way radio

, transmitter. This SAC Letter instructed that adequate steps be

taken to insure that! gasoline tanks on two-way radio cars were

free from leaks which would permit fumes to enter the trunk

compartment.

NW 55044 Docid 32989526 Page 425

## Page 426

It has been noted during recent radio equipment

maintenance inspections in several field offices that some

two-way radio automobiie installations have the two-way unit

installed in the main part of the trunk directly above the

gasoline tank.

This Is considered a very undesirable practice

since there is very little space between the floor of the

car trunk and the gasoline tank and it is quite easy to puncture

the gasoline tank during the course of the radio installation.

No instances of gasoline fumes in the trunks of cars were

noted during the maintenance inspections.

However, the in-

herent danger is such that you are instructed that

all future

two-way radio installations in cars must have the radio unit

mounted in such location and in such manner that there is no

chance of any mounting screws penetrating the gasoline tank.

Also, all field Electronic Maintenance Technicians should be

instructed to carefully inspect all present two-way radio :

installations to assure that there is not now any gasoline

fume leakage into automobile trunks

and that the installations

are completely safe in all other respects.

You are again reminded that Agents should be most

F- YFUGITIVES - UNLAWFUL FLIGHT INVESTIGATIONS -- A recent case

An eastern office was requested by a state prosecutor

to apprehend a fugitive whom he identified by nare and FBI number.

After the individual identified by the

local prosecutor had been

apprehended as a result of an FBI alert, he denied his guilt.

The local prosecutor discovered by further investigation that the

person whose apprehension he

had requested was not the individual

responsible for the state crime.

## Page 428

The primary purpose of the Fugitive Felon Act is to

permit the FBI to locate and apprehend fugitives who flee across

state lines to avoid state

justice.

We do not have the responsi-

ollity or solving or investigating the state crime; however, we

nust be ever alert to detect any possibility that state officials

have requested location of a person other than the one responsible

for the state offense.

In many instances, we will be interviewing

persons who are also witnesses in the state case for the purpose

of developing fugitive leads, background information and contacts

of the subject.

In connection with such interviews, we must be

alert to any information which would suggest an erroneous identi-

fication may have been made by local authorities.

Should

such

occur, the facts should be immediately brought to the attention

of local authorities and the U.S. Attorney, and immediate steps

taken to correct the situation, promptly furnishing full facts to

the Bureau.

In an important area of our assistance to local

authorities under the expanded Fugitive Felon Act, namely confine-

ment cases, which include state parole violator fugitives, there

is already

a positive identification with a known fingerprint

record. This identifying information should be obtained at the

outset of the investigation.

An aggressive discharge of our responsibilities under

the act requires the establishment of effective liaison with

state parole and penal authorities.

to avoid confinement after their probation or parole has been

revoked for a state offense within the provisions of Title 18,

Section 1073. Application of the act in such cases is not

directed at the state parole or probation offense itself, which

in some instances may not be a felony, but is directed toward

the state offense for which the subject was originally convicted.

Accordingly, in any case where the prior conviction was for a

felony, the

act might be applied.

The Department has given considerable latitude and

discretion to U.S. Attorneys in the enforcement of the act and

has not limited its application to a particular list of state

crimes. The department rather has advised U.s. Attorneys that

the act may be applied except where the purpose

of the local

statute is the entorcement or a civil obligation, or where the

local law or application thereof is discriminatory.

(G) SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENT OF INCOME TAXES --

As a result of contemplated prosecutions under the Internal

Security Act of 1950, Departmental attorneys are interviewing

many informants and former

informants as prospective witnesses

in a number of our offices.

This is to again remind you that

Section 107, N, 6, Manual of Instructions, requires that informants

who receive compensation for their services

to the Bureau should

be advised that such compensation must be reported as income when

filing income tax returns.

When

an informant or former informant is initially con-

sidered as a potential witness in a Bureau case, it is desirable

when advising him of the approaching interview by Departmental

attorneys to ascertain prior to such interview all necessary in-

formation concerning his tax status. If he has not paid his taxes,

obtain all pertinent details and promptly submit your recommendations

for handling this situation.

(H): SECURITY INFORMANTS - CHANNELIZING INFORMANT STATEMENTS --

The following method for preparing informant statements, which are

orally received and where multiple channelization is involved, is

being brought to your attention for use if suited to the needs of

your office.

Where the number of copies to be channelized requires

the use of multillth equipment. it is suggested that when typing

up the original of the statement for authentication by the informant,

the plain paper, devoid of Bureau markings or identification,

should be inserted in the typewriter backed by Multilith Reproducing

Carbon Paper, No. 200-837-100A, and a Multilith master in that order.

In this manner as the original is typed, the same impression is

recorded on the Multilith master. Then, after authentication of

the original by the informant, the master is available to run off

the requisite channelizing copies.

The cost to the Government of the aforementioned brand of

carbon paper is about $2.67 per 100 sheets which are 10 inches by

13z inches in size. Experimentation with this paper, which is

designed for one-time use, has disclosed that, by cutting it in

half anâ using each haif twice by reversing it top to bottom after

each use, each full sheet may be

used

four times.

The Bureau does

not stock this paper; therefore, each office desiring to make use

of this system is authorized to

purchase it locally.

(I) CIRCUIT RIDERS, INC. -- It has recently come to the Bureau's

attention that Circult Riders, Incorporated, has published a book

entitled "A Compilation of Public Records of 658 Clergymen and

Laymen Connected

With the National Council of Churches."

this book was

mailed directly to the Special Agent in Charge

at one of our offices, and it is possible that other offices may

receive copies of this

book.

For your information, the Circuit

Riders is an organization made up primarily of laymen in the

Methodist Church whose objective is to combat communism in the

Methodist Church; however, the organization has no official con-

nection with that Church.

Myers G. Lowman is the Executive

Secretary of the organization, and

in recent years he has leveled

numerous charges

against clergymen, indicating they are sympathetic

toward communism. Lowman has been critical in the past of speeches

on communism by a Bureau official and while we accept information

from Lowman, contacts

are most circumspect with him.

Lowman, through his organization, has disseminated

several other books of a similar type as the current one, which is

a compilation of affiliations of the officers and clergymen of the

National Council of Churches in pacifist organizations, one-world

groups, socialist organizations, popular-front-type of

action

groups

and communist front organizations, publications, petitions,

• et cetera.

The reliability of the material in Lowman's book has

not been established, and you should, therefore, appropriately

mark this book, if you should receive a copy, to the effect that

there has been no corroboration of the material it contains and

the FBI should in no instance utilize it as a source by itself.

In all cases, the original source, if there is one, should be

utilized rather than the book.

(E) USE OF FORM FD-217 TO OBTAIN BUREAU FILE NUMBER -- Manual

of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 4, Page 3, Paragraph 14,

requires that Form FD-217 be used

by the field to obtain the

Bureau file number when additional correspondence with the Bureau

can be foreseen.

Use of the Bureau file number on correspondence

from the field

reduces processing time and costs at the Seat of

Government and is an aid to identification of the case both in

the field and at the Seat of Government.

A number of instances have been noted at the Bureau where

Form FD-217 is not attached to correspondence being submitted, the

Bureau file number is not quoted, and it Is apparent that adaitional

correspondence will be had with the Bureau. You should insure that

personnel in your office are properly utilizing Form FD-217 and that

they are quoting the Bureau file number on correspondence when it is

available. For your information, it is not necessary to quote the

Bureau file number on applicant-type correspondence.

(F) TRAINING - POLICE - STATE ACCREDITATION -- Many instances

have come to the Bureau's attention where funds have been made

certain requirements have been met.

One requirement often is

that all instructors participating

in these schools be accredited

to teach by the state board of education. Some offices have felt

that FBI instructors should be given this accreditation and

overtures of blanket accreditation for all FBI instructors have

been made in at least one instance. Such accreditation is usually

in the form of a vocational teaching certificate.

It is felt that this would be an opportune time to explore

the requirements and procedures for obtaining state accreditation

for our police instructors.

SACs having offices covering capitals

in states where police training

is under the regulations of state

boards of education should discreetly, through established sources,

determine the requirements for state

accreditation of police

instructors.

The information obtained should be furnished the Bureau

by June 22, 1962. Offices covering state capitals should send

information copies of their communications to other offices in

the state.

(G) CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION - Reference

1s made to SAC Letter 62-19 (J) dated March 27, 1962, emphasizing

the constant critical need for top quality informants.

Many

informants throughout the field supply a vast amount of informatior

consistently which enables the Bureau

to successiully conclude

highly important matters.

Many of these informants because of

their intimate knowledge of criminals and criminal activities

beyond their immediate communities have been successfully used

in penetrating illegal operations in distant areas.

A survey of offices operating the most productive

Informants revealed these informants were developed as a

result of initially carefully selecting individuals close

to criminal operations and thereafter expending sufficient

time and effort to further their development.

The initial

approach was for the ostensible purpose of interviewing the

prospective informant as a suspect in a pending matter.

The

elimination of the potential informant as a

a climate conducive to his further devet mint since matered

criminals are apprehensive of being

because of their

past records. It was found that an extensive period of careful

handling was vital to the exploitation of full potential of the

informant. During this period, background concerning the

individual under development was obtained to the extent that

the prospective informant was convinced that the FBI was aware

of the most minute details of his activities.

In most instances at the outset financial reward

was not an important factor in the development of top flight

informants.

However, after the individual committed himself

to cooperate, money became "all important" in maintaining his

continued interest and productivity.

Obtaining signed receipts

presented no problem and was felt to be beneficial in most

instances.

Once payments were started to the informant,

promptness in paying for information appeared to be more

important to the informant than the actual amount paid.

Without exception respect for the FBI was the high

motivating factor in his assumption of the informant role.

In some cases distrust of police officers in the

early stages

• of development included FBI Agents. This had to be overcome

by a confident mature approach of the Special Agent in

portraying the Bureau's high standard of operation and role i

of the confidential informant in bringing about the Bureau's

successful accomplishments.

Discussion with the informant as

to the safeguards utilized

by the Bureau to protect informants

and how arrests and recoveries could be effected without

disclosing an informant's identity were essential points in

establishing the necessary confidence to induce the prospective

informant to actively produce information for the Bureau.

In connection with the development and the subsequent

handling of the informant it was

frequently necessary to insure

no action was taken by him which would arouse the suspicion of

his criminal associates. Of necessity the Special Agent must

his criminals

exercise a high degree of ingenuity and maturity in guiding

the informant.

An interesting facet of the criminal mind on which

Special Agents have been able to capitalize is the intense

dislike harbored by criminals for certain types of other

criminals. Frequently the thief has contempt for the narcotics

vendor;

the armed robber intense dislike for the confidence

man, and so on.

Giving the informant a sense of importance, showing

respect for his judgment, accepting his past, and instilling

a sense of accomplishment serve to promote the spirit of

cooperation which results

in increased productivity. Although

some information may be trivial, it was important to take

copious notes even on the most minute piece of information

to impress the informant and to later evaluate his reliability.

The above is to assist you in this important phase

of our operations which has such a direct bearing on our over-

all accomplishments.

• (H) ESPIONAGE AND FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS - SURVEILLANCES

OF SOVIET-BLOC PERSONNEL - For years Soviet officials in the United

States have made numerous and repeated trips throughout this country

aimed at obtaining valuable data regarding our air bases, missile

sites and other important defense installations.

In recent years

they have coordinated their activities in this regard with the

satellite countries and in this way are getting coverage of areas

in the United States closed to Soviet travel:

In connection with our responsibility in regard to coverage

of Soviet-bloc activities, these Soviet-bloc officials have been

placed under surveillance.

Many offices have participated in these

surveillances, and it appears that this activity on the part of the

Soviet bloc will continue.

On May 16, 1962, a number of newspapers in the United

states carried an Assocated Press articliveata," the cord lay 15,

1962, reporting that a correspondent for

Soviet Government newspaper, alleged that during a

recent tour of

the United States

he was constantly shadowed by the "American secret

service."

He also alleged newspaper reporters and television men

had "close business connections with the FBI" because reporters met

him at the railroad station in Portland, Oregon, when he arrived

there. He alleged he was under heavy surveillance in Seattle,

Washington, and furnished license numbers of two automobiles

alleged were conducting surveillance of him in Los Angeles,

California.

The Bureau determined that the allegations of the soviet

correspondent were completely false and undoubtedly were an attemot

by the soviets to embarrass this Bureau and to curtail our counter-

intelligence operations.

There is a definite possibility other

Soviet-bloc personnel may make similar charges in the future and

in this connection may attempt to obtain proof of their allegations,

such as obtaining photographs of Bureau cars or surveillance agents.

It is known that bloc personnel have made numerous attempts to do

this in the past.

We do not intend to allow a false allegation by the

Soviet bloc to alter coverage of their activities.

Our surveil-

lances undoubtedly have hampered the soviets in collection of

Intelligence data in the United States, and we can expect them

to create or utilize any incident they can as a basis for protest

against

our coverage.

It is desired, therefore, that the above facts be

called to the attention of all agents. It should be pointed

out that while the Bureau desires our coverage of Soviet-bloc

officials to be as complete as possible, the surveillance

must be discreet and every precaution must be taken to avoid

You should impress upon agents handling surveillances

(C) TRAINING - POLICE - JUVENILE DELINQUENCY - YOUTHFUL

CRIMINALITY SCHOOLS -- At present there are 47 police instructors

in 35 divisions qualified to teach on the subject of juvenile

delinquency and youthful criminality. An analysis of

the police

training program relating to this topic discloses that there have

been very

few such specialized schools held in recent years.

With

the amount of juvenile crime that exists and

enforcement and the public in this problem, it is believed that

every effort should

be made to expand our police training efforts

in this field. While you should not solicit schools, you must

make every effort to let all cooperative law enforcement agencies

know that these specialized schools are available from the FBI

and that these schools are available at the Command Level, the

Supervisory Level and the Patrolman Level.

You should immediately assure that the Agent personnel in

your division qualified to lecture on juvenile delinquency and

youthful criminality have current knowledge of all facets of the

juvenile problem.

You should insure that your existing reference

materials and lecture outlines are not outdated and they should

be reviewed for currency prior to scheduling of any specialized

schools on this topic.

In organizing these

schools, you should consider using

National Academy graduates with specialized experience in juvenile

work and acceptable outside

experts as well as our own police

instructors as lecturers. It is expected that each such school

will be of a high quality and will utilize the best possible

lecturers available.

The curricula for these schools must be set

up with great care to assure that we present a current factual

school on the existing problems and means of combating juvenile

delinquency and youthful criminality.

(F) SECURITY INFORMANTS' - CONTROL -- Department representatives

have been interviewing security informants as possible witnesses in

prosecutions under the Internal Security Act of 1950.

In many cases,

security informants have shown considerable reluctance to testify

except in the event of a national

emergency for fear of physical

harm, social and business reprisals and other personal reasons.

Instructions are now outstanding for informants to submit their

information in such form that if

they are called upon to testify

their written statements will be available for introduction in court

to back up their testimony.

Despite the fact that they realize they may be needed as

witnesses in the future, some informants are reluctant to testify

for the reasons noted above.

It is the responsibility of the Special Agents handling

security informants to condition them to the fact that someday the

knowledge they possess may be needed as evidence in court to assist

our Government in combatting the evil of communism. All Special

Agents handling security informants must, as a part of our over-all

Informant program, psychologically prepare the informants for the

fact they may,. at

some future date, be called upon to render a still

further contribution to their Government by testifying to the infor-

mation they have furnished concerning security matters.

The proper indoctrination of informants in this regard

1s absolutely essential since it is incumbent upon the Bureau to

provide witnesses whenever the Department initiates prosecution in

security cases.

(G) • SECURITY INFORMANTS - PAYMENTS FOR EXPENSES -- The exorbitant

financial demands by the Nation of Islam (NOI) on its members was

the subject of discussion at the Internal Security-Espionage

Conference held at the Seat of Government on May 28-29, 1962. It

was noted that each temple of the NOI sets the amount of dues which

members must pay and also requires, numerous other collections.

Members

are threatened with expulsion if they do not meet these

demands.

Informants in some cases, however,

have been able to

remain in the organization without making all these payments. All

offices should carefully analyze the necessity for informants in

• any temple to pay the maximum required contributions of the NOI.

Instruct informants to curtail their expenses and whenever possible

have informants create the impression among the temple officials

that they are having financial problems. Work closely with the

informants in this regard and caution them that the Bureau will not

automatically approve their expenses.

(E) ''FOREIGN LANGUAGE TRAINING PROGRAM -- It has come to my

attention that the view is prevalent that age and

length

of service are a bar to consideration for Foreign Language

training and that such training will adversely affect

consideration for office of preference transfers or administrative

advancement.

I wish to emphasize that neither age nor length of

service constitutes an automatic bar to consideration for Foreign

Language training.

The primary factors which are given weight

are (1) the need of the Bureau, which must be paramount and,

(2) the interest, ability, aptitude and availability of individual

Agents. Training in a foreign language definitely does not

prevent an Agent being considered for a transfer to an office

of preference.

Language-trained Agents are listed for their

indicated offices of preference in exactly the same fashion as

other Agents and come up for consideration for such assignments

in the normal manner.

As

regards foreign language ability pre-

cluding consideration for administrative advancement, I wish to

state that this is simply not so.

There are numerous Bureau

executives

at all levels, both at the Seat of Government and in

the field,

who have language ability and have used it on regular

investigative assignments.

It has not hindered their advance-

ment.

matter of fact, there are positions where foreign

language ability is a mandatory requirement for administrative

advancement, such as Legal Attaches.

sidered in connection with administrative advancement are the

Interest, ability and availability of the Agent.

(F'' SEARCHES AND SEIZURES - Federal courts have recently ruled

adversely to the government in two bureau cases involving questions

of search and seizure. These. decisions illustrate again the need

for all investigative personnel to know and closely follow the

rules pertaining to the crucial

search function in criminal cases.

In U. S. V. Rutheiser, 203 F. Supp. 891 (1962), Agents

went to the defendant's home at 8:30 p.m. and obtained what they

considered to be a valid consent to search the home. The search

disclosed stolen goods and the carton in which the goods had

arrived, both of which were specifically pointed out to the Agents

by the defendant during the search. The court ruled, however,

6/19/62

SAC LETTER NO. 62-34

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 449

## Page 450

although the"

... defendant did acquiesce to the search

by the agents," such acquiesence was

.. not that consent

which constitutes an unequivocal, free and intelligent waiver

of a fundamental right."

In reaching this

conclusion, the

court agreed with the defendant's argument that

... the

presence of the agents in his home

at night created an

atmosphere of coercion and duress."

Cases such as this one admittedly pose a difficult

problem.

The truck driver from whom the defendant allegedly

received the stolen goods was in the Bureau office at the

moment, and an immediate search of the defendant's premises

seemed

both logical and necessary. Delay of the search until

daytime might have resulted in the defendant becoming apprised

of the investigation and disposing.of the contraband.

Although the Federal courts vary considerably in their

receptivity to consent searches, and a different court might

well have upheld the search here, consent searches should

always be viewed as difficult to

sustain. Duress is often

Implied from such circumstances as an abnormal hour of search,

words of demand rather than request to search, or any show of

force such as a large number of officers on the premises.

Before attempting a search by consent, consideration

should be given always to the possibility of obtaining à-search

warrant. Searches by warrant are preferable to searches by

consent, and particularly so when premises are involved.

In Mosco v. U.S., 301 F2d 180 (1962), four separate

searches were made but the results of only two

were allowed

into evidence.

I'hese two were a consent search ot a vehicle

and a consent search of the person, both made by Bureau Agents.

To the contrary, the results of a search of premises. by an

Agent and a local officer,

and a vehicle search by a local

officer alone, were not allowed into evidence.

As to the search of premises, the court found that an

Agent and a local officer properly went into the apartment of

one of the two defendants to arrest him on a bank robbery

charge but, on finding the defendant not

there, improperly

searched the apartment for evidence some thirty minutes in

advance of the defendant's arrest when he returned to the

apartment. There being no search warrant and no consent,

6/19/62

NW 55044 DocId: 32969526 Page 450

## Page 451

the search could be sustained only if made incidental to the

arrest, and it did not meet the requirements for this type of

search

because it was made before the arrest

rather than

immediately subsequent thereto as required by the law.

The search of the same defendant's vehicle by a local

officer was ruled out because it was made on no legal basis

whatsoever.

Moreover, defendant's later consent to search his

vehicle, obtained after his arrest, did not cure the illegality

of the search made previously.

The court said, "All searches, such as they were, were

reasonable. They were not such as would shock the conscience

of justice, nor were they contrary to one's sense of fair play."

Nevertheless, two of the searches were held insufficient to

meet Federal constitutional standards.

The result was that the

conviction of one of the two defendants was reversed and

remanded for new trial on lawfully acquired evidence only.

Bring this information to the attention of all

investigative personnel.

• points involved in both decisions cited here is available in

(G)' REPORT WRITING - SECURITY - THOROUGHNESS -- The Bureau has

recently noted a number of instances in security matter reports

wherein some anticipated or planned activity is reported but

there is no follow-up statement in the report that the activity

did, in fact, take place. This has occurred even though the

period of the report has encompassed the date of the alleged

activity. This is

obviously an undesirable practice as 1u

leaves the reader

"Up in the air"

as to whether the activity

did or did

not take place. Also, such a situation could imply

inadequate investigation and thus prove embarrassing because

of the responsibility the Bureau has for dissemination to other

agencies which rely on the Bureau for the full facts in given

situations.

This matter should be brought to the attention of all

Special Agents engaged in security work who should be reminded

of the necessity for thoroughness in the preparation of reports

so as to eliminate the undesirable tendency noted above.

that thesé refugees will be arriving in the near future at the

RE: "SECURITY INDEX - CUBÁ

SAC letter Number 60-54 established criteria for inclusion

of individuals on the Security Index based on their pro-Castro

sympathies and for the tabbing as "pro-Cuban" of other individuals

already on the Security Index.

In recognition of the mounting

tension between Cuba and the United States, adaitional Standards

for placing individuals on the security Index based solely or

their pro-Castro activities and sympathies have been established

to complement the standaras outlined in SAC letter 60-54.

/.

Aliens of Cuban nationality and aliens holding Cuban

citizenship should be considered for the Security Index when it

is determined that one of these

(1) is likely to roster,

encourage, or promote the policies, prugrams, or objectives of

the Cuban Government, or collaborate wich the Cuban Government

F collaborare

(2) is likely to

engage in or attemot to

engage in acts of

espionage,

sabotage or other activities inimical or detrimental

to the defense or public safety of the United States as shown by

overt acts or statements established through reliable sources,

informants, or individuals.

Activities on a subject's part which should be considered

in determining whether his name should be added to the security

Index under the above would include but should not be limited to

(1) participation in organizations supporting the Castro regime,

(2) participation in picket lines formed in support of the

this country on behalf of the Cuban Government or,

(4) statements

or activities on a subject's part establishing reasonable grounds

to believe that his loyalty would lie with the Cuban Government

in the event of armed conflict between the United States and Cuba.

There must be a showing of activities of the type

described above subsequent to october l, 1400, and this must

be verified by investigation. In essence, these standards

nave been estabiished to cover Cuban nationals who nave detinitely

evidenced support of Castro or a communist regime in Cuba since

October 1, 1960.

This move is being made to insure special consideration

is given those potentially dangerous individuals who retair

basic loyalties to the procommunist

regime in Cuba but who have found i PrO-Soviet Bloc and anti-U. S.

expedient not to engage

in activities to an extent which would bring them within the

previously proscribed standards.

Effective immediately no cases-involving pro-Castro

allegations against aliens of Cuban nationality and aliens holding

Cuban citizenship are to be closed without consideration being

given to whether the subjects thereor should be piaced on the

security Index in keeping with this sac letter.

À statement

showing why they do not qualify should be included on

a cover

page of the closing report or in other closing communication if

the appropriate FD-122 reconmending inclusion of the individual

on the Security Index is not submitted. A systematic review of

all Internal Security - Cuba and Registration Act - Cuba cases

closed since October 1: 1960

and any other appropriate control files (such as

those containing INS name check forms G-135a showing pro-Castro

allegations have

been made against Cuban aliens arriving in the

U. S.) should

also be reviewed.

Special consideration is to be given those individuals

previously recommended for the security index but whose participation

in organizational activities on behalf of Castro was not sufficient

to come within the previously established criteria.

those individuals whose investigative files show they clearly fall

within

to verify their present employments and

report containing this data and any unreported pertinent derogatory

information, and forward fD-122 with accompanying succinct summary

justifying reconmendations for inclusion on the Security Index.

In the immediate future Bureau will forward to each

interested office amended Security Index cards designated in the

upper right-hand corner "CUB" for this Special Section.

SAC letter 60-54 (F) provided for "pro-Cuban" tabbing

of individuals carried on the Security Index for reasons other

than their Cuban organization affiliations or nationalistic

tendencies.

The Security index cards on such subjects are no

to be placed in the new

"Cuban" Special Section.

In order that

they may be readily identified, however, these cards in the

Aiphabetical section of the security index should be tadde

with a metal tab of a color different from that used to tab

"DETCOM"

subjects.

In the immediate future Bureau will forward

to each interested office a list of those subjects whose names

should be so tabbed.

" For your information, cards on such subjects

contain the capital

• letter "C"

on the left

side of the card at

the beginning of the second line.

Upon receipt of the foregoing amended cards and lists,

all offices are to immediately verify the residences and employ-

ments of those Security Index subjects placed thereon on the basis

of their pro-Castro activities as well as those other Security

Index subjects tabbed "pro-Cuban." FD-122 showing changes should

be expedited. Be certain arrangements are made to assure you

are advised of any subsequent changes in their residences and

employments.

All offices except Miami and New York should complete

this review and advise the Bureau by October sisecurity Index

1902 as follows:

(1) Number of individuals being recommended for

based on field office's evaluation that they positively fall

within the newly established criteria; (2) Number of cases being

opened or reopened to establish whether the individuals fit the

new criteria;

With regard to the "pro-Cuban" tabbing of current

special attention must be given to each case and a determination

made as to whether those who have in any manner demonstrated

RE: BUREAU CODES

A number of field offices have sent to the Bureau

recently enciphered messages which could not be deciphered.

This causes delay and unnecessary expenditure of employee time

In attempting to decode such garbled messages.

Section II B., subsection 2.g., page 12, instructs that an

The AFSAM-7 Manual of Operation and Routine Maintenance,

enciphered message is to be completely check-deciphered prior

to transmission, preferably by another operator and, if avail-

able, on a second machine using a different set of

rotors.

This check-decipherment is mandatory.

If this check-decipherment procedure were followed

meticulously on all messages by each office, failures to encode

properly would be detected prior to transmission, and

majority of garbles in messages would be eliminated.

Explanations will be requested by the Bureau for

messages received which are undecipherable, and if this is due

to failure to check-decipher, appropriate administrative action

will be taken.

and December 31, 1963, would be increased 4 per cent; those com-

mencing during 1964, 3 per cent; those commencing during 1965, 2

per cent; and those commencing during 1966, 1 per cent.

(2) Beginning in January, 1904, yearly changes in the nation-

wide cost of living will be reviewed by the Civil Service Commissior

and whenever the cost of living rises at least 3 per cent, annuities

will be further increased by a percentage matching the rise in the

cost of living.

(3) The:reduction in an employee's annuity to provide for a survivor

annuity will be changed from 22 per cent of the first $2400, plus

10 per cent of the balance to 22 per cent of the first $3600, plus

10 per cent of the balance. This will apply, once Congress appropriates

funds, to all retiring employees separated on or after October 11,

1962, with an annuity commencing after that time.

Provisions which increase survivor protection include:

(1) The survivor has been eligible for 50 per cent of the annuity

of the employee but the new law changes this to 55 per cent. This

applies to annuities based on separations occurring on or after

October 11, 1962, but again must await appropriation of the necessary

"funds. Furthermore, instead of requiring that a retiring married

employee must specifically designate his spouse to receive a

survivor annuity, such annuity will be payable automatically unless

employee at the

time he retires specifies

otherwise in writing.

This particular change is now in effect and requires no appropriation

by Congress.

(2) Survivor annuity payments to a child otherwise eligible for

annuity can continue beyond the former limit of age 18 and up to

age 21 if he is a student regularly pursuing full-time residence

study in a high school, trade school, technical or vocational

institute, junior college, college, university or comparable

recognized institution.

This will apply where the parent employee

or annuitant dies on or after October I1, 1962, or where the death

occurred before

that date but the surviving student-child is not 18

until on or after that date.

The annuity of a student-child ends

when he marries, dies, ceases

to be a student or becomes 21,

whichever occurs first. This benefit likewise must await appropriation

of

• the necessary funds by Congress.

(F) ' ECONOMY - FISCAL YEAR 1963 -- An analysis at this time of the

Bureau's financial condition projected through the end of the current

fiscal year (1963) indicates many items of expense are being incurred

at a rate that if continued would substantially exceed available

funds. For example, (1) the Bureau is being required by the Bureau

of the Budget to absorb an additional cost of about $133,000 for

postage rate increases to go into effect January 1, 1963, for which

no additional funds will be made available; (2) higher costs of

long distance, and teletype services; (3) higher travel costs;

10ca (4) repairs and alterations to space.

Your attention was

called

to the higher-communications costs in item A of SAC Letter No. 02-45

dated August 28, 1962.

Because of these higher costs, and in order

to make sure no

deficit will be incurred, the Burcau is making a

corresponding reduction in the funds available for the purchase of

equipment. This action means that only requests for absolutely

essential

supplies and equipment will be approved by the Bureau.

- 5 -•

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 472

## Page 473

No requests for repairs or alterations to space should be made

unless they are absolutely

essential to the Bureau's proper and

efficient operation.

Requests submitted only on the basis that

they are desirable will be turned down.

In addition your full

and complete cooperation is requested .in keeping all other costs

to an absolute minimum consistent with the proper performance of

our work.

With your full cooperation it is believed that the

Bureau can avoid taking any more drastic steps.

(C) - VOUCHERS - GOVERNMENT TRANSPORTATION REQUESTS - OFFICIAL

TRAVEL BY BUPEAU EMPLOYEES - USE OF FIRST-CLASS ACCOMMODATIONS -

You have previously been advised of the need for the reduction

of travel

expenses. The Bureau of the Budget has now advised

that the percentage of first-class air flights by employees of

any agency should be less than fifty per cent of the authorized

travel.

A survey of the travel performed by Bureau personnel

during October, 1962, indicates that approximately sixty-nine

per cent of all air flights were first-class.

Accordingly, effective immediately, any employee of

the Bureau traveling first-class by air must have prior approval

from the Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Director unless

no other air accommodations are available and there is not

sufficient time to obtain the authority of the Special Agent in

Charge or Assistant Director.

In any instance where first-class

air travel is used, a statement must accompany the voucher

claiming reimbursement justifying the use of the first-class

accommodations.

The Department of Justice has also advised that rail

• travel for distances of less than 250 miles must be by coach

unless there is some reason this is not feasible. Effective

immediately, justification must accompany the voucher reflecting

any first-class rail transportation of less than 250 miles.

Appropriate manual changes will be forthcoming.

MATTERS -- With increasing frequency members of the Nation

their affiliation with and

belief in the teachings of NoI. On

the basis of FBI reports

in these matters the Department

prepares a summary, copies of which are furnished to a hearing

officer and the registrant.

Because of the method in which

conscientious objector reports are handled and use made of them

by the Department, they should contain nothing which would

require classification under Executive Order 10501.

Conscientious objector reports on members and affiliates

• of the NOI should contain a current approved thumbnail sketch

pertaining to the national organization of the Not and/or fruit

of Islam (FOI) where applicable so the Department and

Miami area during the coming winter season, field offices are

instructed to furnish the Miami Office complete details as to

'the itinerary and appropriate descriptive details including intended

mode of travel on hoodlums and racketeers visiting the Miami area.

As soon as this data is ascertained this information is to be

forwarded by whatever appropriate expeditious communication is

deemed necessary in each instance which will enable the Miami Office

to have sufficient notice to provide coverage.

In notifying the Bureau and Miami Office of the intended

travel of a hoodlum, each field office should also include

information on the

availability of

any highly placea informants

in a position to travel to this area to provide coverage on

the hoodlums' activities.

The Bureau will thereafter decide

if the travel of a particular informant is

warranted.

I am pleased to note the decrease in the over-all number of accidents

_during fiscal year 1962. The number of accidents was reduced from 309 in fiscal

year 1961 to 286 for fiscal year 1962. A close analysis of this report reflects a

favorable trend in several areas and I certainly hope this trend continues.

It should be noted that the principal cause of accidents was rear-end

collisions which accounted for 65. 9 per cent of all accidents in which Bureau

employees were held responsible. Intersection collisions ranked second accounting

for 22.7 per cent of those accidents in which Bureau employees were held responsible.

A number of accidents which occurred in 1962 were the result of cars' striking parked

vehicles, cars being sideswiped and drivers' pulling out from parked positions at

the curb into moving traffic.

Last year instructions were issued that each employee must develop

good defensive driving habits in order to keep the number of accidents at a minimum.

These instructions should be reiterated at this time to endeavor to effect an even

further reduction in accidents.

(B) INVESTIGATIVE MATTERS RECEIVED -- An examination of the Monthly

Administrative Reports reflects there is a substantial decrease in the number

of investigative matters being received, the cause of which must be immedi-

ately determined and necessary remedial action taken.

All offices showing a decrease in investigative matters received are

requested to thoroughly review the situation so that the factors contributing

to this decrease may be determined and steps taken to correct this undesirable

trend which has occurred.

An examination of all sources from which cases are received should

disclose any weaknesses in existence.

It is desired that this study be completed

within ten days of the receipt of this letter and that your findings, together with

specific recommendations for corrective action taken by you, be submitted to

the Bureau.

(D) SEIZURE OF MATERIAL UNDER INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF OBSCENE

MATTER STATUTE -- The decision on November 5, 1962, by the Circuit

•Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, reversing the convictions of

Arthur Abraham Peisner and Harry Morris Disman for violation of the

Interstate Transportation of Obscene Matter Statute expresses views

on probable cause which should be kept in mind during future

investigations of this type.

In October, 1958, a reliable informant advised that

Peisner would transport obscene material from Maryland to New York,

probably over the week end of October 31, 1958. He had previously

been linked with the manufacture and sale of obscene material.

Bureau Agents on November 1, 1958, observed Peisner and Disman

loading packages into a car at Peisner's Maryland residence.

They

and into New Jersey where

they entered the New Jersey Turnpike.

Bureau Agents alerted the

New Jersey State Police to

the possibility that Peisner and Disman

were transporting obscene material, and the subjects were arrested

by the State Police while on the turnpike. More than 1,500 obscene

books were taken from the car.

both subjects were

convicted

A Federal complaint was

filed, and

for violation of the Interstate Trans-

portation of Obscene Matter Statute.

On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the

convictions of both

subjects.

The search of the automobile without

a warrant was not based on sufficient probable cause to believe that

the books being transported were obscene.

Once examined, the

obscenity of the books was admitted, but

the information

in possession

of the officers at the time the search of the automobile was

initiated

was insufficient to meet

a strict standard of probable cause for

vehicle search in ooscene literature,cases.

that as

a minimal requirement for a search

publications thought to be obscene it is essential that some qualified

individual, aware of the proper test of obscenity as announced in

the case of Roth v. United States, 354 US 476 (1957), should have

made a determination prior to search and seizure that a publication

meets that test.

The proper test of obscenity as announced in the

Roth case is "whether to the average person, applying contemporary

community standards, the dominant theme of the

material taken as a

whole appeals to prurient interest."

The court held that the test

is the effect "not upon any

particular class, but upon all those

whom it is likely to reach.")

A different conclusion was reached in the case of Weise v.

United States, 251 F 2d 867 (1958), in which the facts were strik-

ingly similar and the "minimal requirement" demanded by the court

Six persons were present and they, according to the

source, comprised the beginning of an officer corps of

the organization. Rockwell told those present that the

WUFENS would be an international movement, but that the

section of the organization in the United

States would

be known as the American Party of the WUFENS.

Rockwell, on March 26, 1959, furnished to Special

Agents of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, a copy of

che program of the WUFENS, stating that he expects to

secome the president of the United States through the

organization's platform.

The main tenets of the WUrENS,

as reflected in the program, call for the migration ọi

Negroes to Africa and the trial and execution of all Jews

guilty of Communist and Zionist treason.

A second source advised on August 15, 1962, that the

main activity of the organization in furtherance of these

objectives, has consisted of picketings with anti-Jewish

and anti-Negro placards; talks by Rockwell attacking Jews

as traitors to the United States; attempts by Rockwell to

form Nazi

groups in various cities in the Initer States;

and attempts to form a group of international sympathizers.

Rockwell prints large amounts of Nazi literature at

American Nazi Party Headquarters, 928 North Randolph

Street, Arlington, Virginia.

On June 29, 1962, the State of Virginia revoked the •

charter of the American Nazi Party.

On September 20, 1962, the State Corporation

Commission of Virginia issued a charter for a "George Lincoln

Rockwell Party."

The second source mentioned above advised

on September 24, 1962, that Rockwell will continue to

carry on his activities, using the name American Nazi Party,

and he obtained the charter for the George Lincoln Rockwell

Party merely to be able to do business as a

corporation.

ARYAN KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN

P. 0. BOX 5062, WACO, THRAS

On March 29, 1955, a source advised that

Horace Sherman miller, 1401 North 13th Street, Haco,

Texas, formerly was a member-at-large of the U. S. Klans

of Georgia, but in approximately 1947, he was ousted from

that organization by E. I. Edwards, Imperial Wizard.

Isador Fred, of Haco, Texas, on August 4, 1962, anc

• Waco's Chief of Police Jesse Gunterman, on August 17;

1962, furnished the following information: Miller self-

styled himself as "The Aryan Knight" and began distributing

his writings under the caption "Aryan Knights of the Ku Klux

Klan Religion" in approximately 1957. He is a prolific

letter writer and since 1957, he has

published and

distributed his pamphlets entitled, "The Aryan Views-

White Folk News."

This publication contains reprints of

articles which have

appeared in newspapers and magazines

and are anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, anti-Masonic, antí-

Negro, and

pro-klan propaganda.

leaflets which set forth the tenets of the "Aryan Knights

of the KKK religion," and which request contributions from

the readers.

Sheriff C. C. Maxey, Waco, Texas, on August 10, 1962,

informed that Miller is a disabled World War I veteran

who receives retirement benefits from the Railway Retirement

Board which he uses to defray the cost of publishing this

propaganda.

articles and letters which are critical of the U. S. Supreme

Court, the Attorney General, and the Kennedy Administration,

and Miller has attacked efforts to integrate public schools

and public facilities in the South. Recently, he denounced

integration of the public schools, in the city of Maco.

focus the full glare of publicity on this problem. Particular

attention should be directed to tactfully obtaining full cooperation

of all news outlets in your area not only in publicizing the crimes

themselves, but also in affording equal coverage to the subsequent

arrest and

sentencing of guilty parties. All personnel should

be

instructed to stress the importance of

such publicity in their

normal contacts with representatives of mass communications media.

Small town weekly and/or daily newspapers can be particularly

helpful in this regard, since such crimes are usually of great news

Interest in rural areas. I feel that such publicity, especially

that pertaining to the arrest and incarceration of the culprits.

will serve as a definite deterrent to "amateurs"

considering such

crimes and convince them that the possibility of profit does not

warrant the risk involved.

One method to acquaint the public

with this problem is through feature articles regarding successful

investigations conducted by your respective offices in this field.

Inquiries concerning guidance and assistance in obtaining material

not

informants previously developed may provide the effective type

of coverage needed, continuing increased responsibilities being

a critical analysis of the criminal informant coverage and

letter answers to the following:

Does informant program provide

coverage of all prevalent criminal activity throughout territory?

Although your conferences should be closed

to all but duly

constituted law enforcement officers and those specifically invited

to attend from the banking and related professions, you should plan

each so that the last hour will be open to news media representatives

and their attendance should be encouraged. A basic need in the drive

to reduce crimes against banking institutions is the cooperation of

various news media, especially with respect to their handling of

news regarding such violations. •Your conferences should be used to

inform news media

representatives, both executives and the reporters

who gather and write crime and court news, of the problem and how they

can help.

This time should be arranged, if possible, so it will not

conflict with news deadlines. It is suggested that you, a representative

of the banking industry, and a spokesman for local law enforcement

present a short summary

of the various aspects of the conference

during this last hour.

All statements should, of course, present a

united viewpoint and following the statements,

the three representatives

should make themselves available for questions by the news media.

Where possible, it should be stressed to the news media that law

enforcement and the banking industry seek the cooperation of the news

media in stressing the importance of prominent presentation of news

relating to the arrest and sentencing

of bank robbers.

arrest and sentencing of a bank robber are not as interesting or

newsworthy as the account of the crime itself. However, the

prominent display of bank robbery stories without similar display of

the accounts of arrest and sentencing of a robber might well lead

others to attempt the crime with the mistaken feeling that it is

a good way to get rich quickly. The recent general increase in

crimes of this nature certainly demands the best efforts of all

interested citizens to reduce these serious offenses.

Within a week after your last conference, advise Bureau of

results of your conferences, giving the number of

people in attendance,

the number of different agencies represented (broken down according

to law enforcement, banks, banking associations, Hederal credit unions,

insurance companies, surety companies,

etc.), as well as dates and

number of conferences completed.

RE: TELEPHONES -

SECURITY OF BUREAU TELEPHONE SERVICE

Telephone companies are rapidly extending the automation of telephone

services. With this automation program they are increasing the number of

unattended telephone exchanges. Some operating companies have found it

economically necessary to incorporate facilities to permit operators to use

a device, known as a "no test number" or a "busy verification test, " to dial

in and listen to the conversation on a busy telephone line. The number the

operator must dial to override the busy signal is classified "SECRET"' by the

companies and is disseminated only on a "need-to-know" basis. This number,

while classified "'SECRET," may be inadvertently disclosed to an unauthorized

person who may use it to monitor telephone conversations.

This "busy verification test"' number, while limited to a relatively

few isolated areas, is not restricted to local calls but can be extended to

dialed long-distance calls. It is possible for a person, knowledgeable of the

busy verification code number, to dial in on a busy telephone line in these

isolated areas from any part of the United States and Canada, where direct

distance dialing facilities are present, and to listen to the conversation on

the busy line. The automatic accounting machines in the exchange will

identify the telephone subscriber using the "secret number" in making the

call as well as the number dialed but will report the call as being "non-

billable."

The Bureau recognizes that the busy override feature is available in

only a limited number of isolated areas; however, it is felt that, because of

the potential security problem involved in any dial system, you should conduct

a survey and advise Bureau of the number of exchanges which have the busy

override feature. Your survey should be restricted to lines serving your

office, resident agencies, any other official telephone lines and the home

telephones of your supervisory and resident agent personnel who may handle

official calls at their residences. In addition, you should indicate what

•. steps you are taking to have those lines, which your survey indicates are

available to the override feature, isolated from the override equipment.

Further, you should outline what preventive measures you have effected to

insure against the Bureau lines being subjected to this undesirable condition

in the future.

All security checks of official lines shall, in the future, include inquiry

concerning the busy override feature and, when applicable, verification that

this feature no longer provides override onto Bureau lines.

Use of this technique constitutes

a wire tap and thereby comes under

all the legislative and administrative restrictions governing such matters.

There is attached, for the assistance of the Sound-trained personnel

of your office, a technical discussion of the above-mentioned override device.

SECURITY OF TELEPHONE SYSTEMS-

BUSY LINE VERIFICATION

Concurrent with the inauguration of dial telephone

systems the telephone operating companies provided a means for

an operator and/or test deskman to verify a busy line condition.

Most of the operating companies follow the practice of having only

one special trunk line per 10,000 subscribers for use in making

busy line verification tests and they restrict the use of this line

to supervisory personnel. It is not possible, with this special

trunk feature, for unauthorized individuals to seize or override

a busy telephone line as the special trunk line is restricted to

the perimeter of a single central office or exchange building where

it is accessible to only a limited number of employees. It is not,

therefore, available to persons dialing from subscriber and/or

unauthorized stations.

The rapid

extension of automated telephone services and

the increased reliability of dial switching equipment have encouraged

the operating telephone companies to increase the number of un-

attended dial exchanges. These unattended exchanges seldom require

attention and therefore

are, for the most part, visited by authorized

personnel only when there is a need to repair a reported trouble.

Testing of switching equipment and verification of busy line

conditions are performed from a centrally located test center and/or

operator-attended exchange building. All equipment testing between

the

test center and the unattended

exchange and the busy line

verification at the unattended exchange is done over high-quality,

revenue-producing trunk circuits that must be taken out of service

for these purposes.

In order to produce maximum revenue with existing

facilities some operating companies have devised a secret number

system whereby operators and/or test deskmen may call an unattended

exchange over regular subscriber trunking paths to make busy line

verification tests.

This procedure releases revenue-producing

telephone lines that would otherwise be tied up for test purposes.

The number used for this busy line verification is classified

"SECRET" by the operating companies and is disseminated to employees

only on a "need-to-know" basis.

An operator or test deskman making a busy verification

test will first dial the exchange, then the secret number or numbers,

followed by the station code (last four digits). If the line is

busy the employee making the call will first get a busy signal then

55044 DocId: 32989526

Page

536

---

## Page 537

....

the connector will "override the busy line" and connect the caller

to the conversation in progress.

The connection will be made to

the.called subscriber's line without alerting the subscriber.

If

there is a conversation in progress the operator can report a "busy

line" condition; however, if there is no conversation on the line

the operator will usually report that the "line is out of order"

and so advise the trouble desk.

The attendant at the trouble desk

will then dispatch craftsmen to repair the trouble.

The busy verification number, while classified "SECRET,"

may inadvertently be disclosed to an unauthorized person who may

use it to monitor telephone conversations.

The use of the busy

veritIcatIon, although limited to a relatively lew isolated areas,

is not restricted to local calls.

It is possible for a person,

knowledgeable of the busy veritication code number, to dial in on

charged for the call.. The automatic accounting equipment assigned

to the calling telephone will record the called number,

calling

number, date and time of the call and because of the initial busy-

back signal from the called number will record the call as "non-

billable."

Persons knowledgeable of the busy verification code number

can, by dialing the exchange code, then the busy verification code

followed by the station code, cut

Persons using this technique fron a distant

point will first dial the area code followed by the same number

sequence mentioned above. If the called telephone line is not busy

at the time a dialed long-distance call is connected to the called

number, the automatic machine accounting equipment will treat the

call as a regularly dialed long-distance call. On the other hand,

if the called line is busy a short busy signal will be sent back to

the calling station and then the connector will override the busy

condition without alerting the called subscriber.

In making checks of telephone lines in areas with this

feature you should verify, by dialing in on the busy line from another

station, that the Bureau line cannot be subjected to this undesirable

override device.

Any technical questions which arise from the survey or

unusual technical data developed as a result of the survey should

be brought to the attention of the Electronics Section, FBI Laboratory.

(A) / FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY - SEVENTY-SECOND SESSION -- The Seventy-

second Session of the FBI National Academy will begin on Monday,

August 19: 1903, and will graduate on Wednesday, November 6, 1963.

It is desired that you submit to the Bureau by April 1, 1903, the

names of the candidates from your territory whom you desire to

recommend to attend that Session. You should strictly comply with

existing instructions previously given as to the procedures to be

followed in nominating candidates to attend the Academy.

All candidates recommended for attendance at the Academy

must be personally known to the Special Agent in Charge.

The

Special Agent in Charge must have conducted a formal interview with

each candidate being recommended unless such candidate has been

previously interviewed and favorably recommended by the former

Special Agent in Charge within the preceding six months.

It will

not be necessary, however, for the present Special Agent in Charge

to reinterview any candidates he, himself, interviewed even though

more than six months have elapsed

since the time of the first

interview.

You may designate more than one candidate for the Seventy-

second Session since there is a possibility that your first candidate

may not be accepted or that two or more representatives will be

accepted from your office. Unless you advise to the contrary, any

candidate investigated as an alternate to the Seventy-first Session

who is not invited to attend that Session, will be considered as the

first choice of your office for the Seventy-second Session, provided

of course his investigation was completely favorable. In your

letter listing your candidates, you must specifically set forth

the results of the reviews of your field office indices concerning

the applicants and their law enforcement agencies.

The Bureau is desirous of accepting at the National

Academy only those candidates who are outstanding both as to personal

appearance and ability. The weight standards for National Academy

applicants are the same as for our own personnel. Applicants must

be within the desirable weight limits as set forth on form FD-300. If

you have previously submitted a physical examination on any candidate

which will be more than six months old as of April 1, 1963, a

current physical examination form must be executed

with the

ac-

companying FD-300.

The fingerprints oi National Academy applicants are to be

submitted at the time the results of the formal interview are for-

warded to the Bureau. You should make a notation on the fingerprint

SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT - 1948 - DELINQUENT CITIZENS OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES -- On February 18, 1963, the United States Supreme

Court considered jointly Kennedy vs.

Mendoza-Martinez and Rusk vs.

Cort and handed down a written decision (5-4) declaring as uncon-

stitutional those sections of the Nationality Act of 1940 and the

Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 providing for the expatriation

at citizens who leave or remain outside the United states to avoid

military service in time of war or national emergency.

Francisco Mendoza-Martinez was born in California of

Mexican extraction.

In 1942 he fled to Mexico, a country that also

considered him a national. He returned in 1946 and in 1947 he was

convicted, sentenced and

served one year and one day for violation

of the Selective Service Act of 1940.

Subsequently the U. S. Govern-

ment determined nis flight to Mexico

to avoid military service in

time of war effected his expatriation as of the date in 1944 that

section 401 (j) was added to the Nationality Act of 1940 (Public

Law 431, 78th Congress) enacted

as Section 801 (j, Title O, U.s.

As a result of a deportation hearing he was ordered deported

on September 11, 1953. A series of

appeals

culminated in the

Supreme Court decision of February 18, 1963, which affirmed the

ruling of U.S. District Court,. Southern District of California,

Northern Division; that Section 401 (j) was unconstitutional.

Joseph Henry Cort, a medical doctor, born December 27,

1927, at Boston, Massachusetts, registered for Selective Service

May 25, 1951, and departed for

England in June, 1951. • He applied

for.political

asylum in England claiming he faced loss of citizenship

and prison if he returned to the United States. Political asylum

in England denied, he then accepted asylum from Czechoslovakia

Where he continues

to reside.

Cort was indicted by Federal Grand

Jury on December 17, 1954,

for failure to report for induction in

violation of Title 50 (App), 462 and 12 (a). Warrant issued

December 18, 1954, is still

outstanding.

In February, 1960, State

Department affirmed a previous administrative decision that

cort

expatriated himselt under provisions of section 349 (a) (20nd

Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 Public Law 414,

RELIABILITY OF SOURCES USED - The Bureau has recently noted

that many letterhead memoranda (LHM) which are submitted and

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES -

INCOME TAXES

A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

which will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal income tax on

monies received from the Bureau without jeopardizing their security. This plan

will go into effect immediately in the San Francisco and Philadelphia Offices for

a trial period of one year. Payments for services to certain security informants

and sources will be subject to a twenty per cent withholding tax. No tax is to be

withheld from payments made (1) to other than security informants and sources,

(2) for reimbursement of expenses, (3) under the authority of the SAC or (4) to

informants who have been able to report Bureau income on their Federal tax

returns without jeopardizing their security or without challenge from IRS. In

the latter instance, the Bureau must be advised as to the identity of each

informant and the method used by him to report his Bureau income.

Proper records must be maintained of amounts withheld and such

amounts must be placed in a special checking account. At the end of the tax

year, the tax liability will be determined on money paid by the Bureau to those

informants from whom tax has been withheld. Necessary adjustments will be

worked out with the informants and the net amount withheld forwarded to the

Bureau. This money will be turned over to a special representative of IRS

without disclosure as to identities of informants, except for coded numbers.

These numbers can later be used for identification purposes in the event it

becomes necessary to substantiate income tax payments.

Other offices may now utilize the withholding system where it

would be helpful; however, where it is not used, continue to instruct all informants

to pay their taxes on income received from the Bureau by such method as may

be proper and feasible.

Detailed instructions and exhibits are enclosed concerning the

procedure to be followed in the accounting and control of money withheld.

WITHHOLDING OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX

FROM PAYMENTS TO INFORMANIS AND SOURCES

INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEDURES

Introduction:

A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service

(IRS) which will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal

income tax on monies received from the Bureau without jeopardizing

their security. This will require the withholding of twenty per cent

of any payments being made to such individuals for services rendered.

Money so withheld will be immediately deposited to a special checking

account, to be used for this purpose only, set up in the name of the

SAC and ASAC. This account should, if possible, be in a different bank

than that in which the regular office Confidential Fund (blue slip) or

Double Agent (white slip) accounts are maintained. Any bank charges

incidental to this special checking account are to be paid from the

regular office Confidential Fund. Attached to these instructions are

10 Exhibits which are to be used as guides in setting up records for

the maintenance and operations of the withholding accounts. Hereafter,

any reference to informants refers to both informants and sources.

This plan will apply only to those informants or groups of

informants authorized by the Bureau.

Accounting Instructions:

When a payment is to be made to an informant subject to this

plan, the amount to be withheld for income tax purposes will be

twenty per cent of the total for services. A check will be drawn on

the regular office Confidential Fund to cover the total amount of the

authorized payment. This check will be cashed and the amount for taxes

Immediately deposited in the special checking account set up for this

purpose. A duplicate deposit slip is to be obtained for use in posting

to the ledger accounts.

Payment to the informant will then follow and

the receipt to be executed by the informant for such payment should show

not only the amount received as reimbursement for expenses and the

authorized payment for services, but also the amount withheld for

Enclosures (10)

NW 55044 DooId: 32988526 Page 551

---

## Page 552

Federal income tax purposes (Exhibit 1). A Record of Income Tax

Transactions (Exhibits 2 and 3) will be maintained on a calendar-year

basis to record the informant's name, symbol number, period covered,

and the amounts incidental to such transactions. Beginning with the

first payment to an informant involving tax withholding, a new

individual ledger sheet (Exhibits 4 and 5) must be set up. The amount

of money withheld for income tax purposes should also be listed on

the Blue Slip, Form FD 37, prepared with respect to the payment

(Exhibit 6).

At the end of each month, entries

in the Record of Income Tax

Transactions and the individual informant's ledgers will be totaled

and reconciled. A monthly report (Exhibit 7) is to be mailed to the

Bureau in the same manner as the reports for the regular office

Confidential Fund, no later than the 20th of the following month. All

payments involving the tax account must be vouchered prior to the

submission of this report.

In the event an informant subject to this plan is transferred

to another field division, all records must be forwarded to the new

field division, together with a check for the amount of income tax

withheld.

Determining Informant's Tax Obligation:

At the end of the tax year, the contacting Agent will obtain

from the informant his completed Federal income tax return based on his

regular income, exclusive of money paid to him by the Bureau. The

contacting Agent will not question the accuracy of the return except to

point out obvious errors. The contacting Agent will furnish the

informant's tax return to a qualified Special Agent Accountant who will

prepare a separate return to include Bureau income. The accountant will

compute the tax owed by informant on the combined earnings. The

difference between the tax computed by the informant and that computed

by the accountant will represent the amount of tax to be paid by the

informant on money received from the Bureau.

The accountant who

prepared the return will sign on the line "Signature of Preparer Other

Than the Taxpayer." The contacting Agent will have the informant sign

the return prepared by the accountant as a certification that the

informant has reviewed it and found it correct in every respect. The

informant will file his original tax return with the Internal Revenue

Service (IRS). The return prepared by the accountant, together with a

Photostat of the informant's original return, will be maintained in the

'informant's subfile.

MW 55044 DoOId:32989526 Page 552

## Page 553

If the amount withheld from payments to the informant during

the year exceeds the amount of tax for his Bureau income, the refund

due the informant will be withdrawn from the special checking account

and paid to him at the time he signs the return prepared by the

accountant. A receipt (Exhibit 8) must be obtained from him. If the

amount withheld during the year is not sufficient to cover the tax on

Bureau income, the difference should be collected from the informant

and a statement (Exhibit 9)

obtained from him. Entries for any

adjustments, either refunds or additional payments, must be made in

both the informant's ledger (Exhibits 4 and 5) and the Record of

Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2) for the calendar year involved.

Instructions to Informants:

The contacting Agent must fully explain the withholding

procedure to any informant concerned. With regard to the informant's

original tax return, the informant should clearly understand that

(1) neither the contacting Agent nor the Special Agent Accountant is

in any way certifying to its accuracy, (2) if his original tax return

is questioned by IRS, it will be up to him to settle the matter with

IRS, and he cannot plead that it has been examined and approved by an

Agent of the FBI, since such statement is false and the informant would

be uncovered.

Transmittal of Tax to Bureau:

After all adjustments have been made in the income tax

withholding or payments to informants, a report of Federal Income Tax

Deductions (Exhibit 10) will be prepared. The net amount of the tax

indicated on the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2) will

be withdrawn from the special checking account by means of a check made

payable to the Chief Clerk, FBI.

This report and check will be forwarded

to the Bureau, together with receipts for refunds that have been made

and statements of additional tax collected. The necessary entries

showing the transmittal of the tax funds to the Bureau should be made in

the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2). When received at

the Bureau, the tax money will be turned over to a special representative

of IRs with the amounts for each informant identified by a coded number;

thus, the informant's connection with the FBI will be protected.

However, the coded number can be used for identification purposes in

the event it becomes necessary to substantiate the informant's income tax

payment.

(C) PERSONNEL MATTERS - LEAVE - TRAVEL TIME -- Effective immediately,

an employee who drives his

personally owned automobile in effecting

travel on official transfer will be granted travel time, without

• charge to leave, equal to the actual driving time, provided he

averages a minimum of 300 miles per day for the direct route distance.

The travel time starts when he departs on transfer. To illustrate

this policy, the following examples are furnished:

An employee departed Washington, D. C., on a Saturday at

8 a.m., driving his personally owned automobile en route to New

Orleans, Louisiana, on official transfer, and arrived at 7 p.m.

the following Monday. Since he traveled

1,103 miles and his daily

average was

within the 300-mile requirement, no annual leave would

be charged.

However, if during the travel period the employee

decided to stop over

in Knoxville, Tennessee, for two days and

therefore did not report for work in New Orleans until Thursday

morning, annual leave would be charged for two days (Tuesday and

Wednesday).

If the employee performs indirect travel in effecting a

transfer, travel time allowable will be determined by applying the

300-mile-a-day average over the direct route distance.

Excess time involving workdays will be a charge against

annual leave.

As an example of this situation, an employee who

departed

Washington, D. C., on a Saturday for New Orleans, traveled

via Miami, Florida,

and reported for duty in New Orleans at the

beginning of the workday the following Friday.

He would only be

entitled to travel time through monday.

Therefore, Tuesday,

Wednesday and Thursday would be charged to annual leave.

(D) VIOLATIONS OF THE CRIME ABOARD AIRCRAFT STATUTE -- Although

violations of the Crime Aboard Aircraft Statute, Title 49, Section

1472, U. S. Code, are criminal violations specifically assigned

to the FBI, there have been indications recently that some

airlines

are delaying referrals of these violations to the FBI. This has

seriously hampered our investigative effectiveness by preventing

the immediate interviews of crew members and passengers prior to

dispersal, which is of vital importance, particularly when the

violation

occurs

in the air.

To remedy this situation, within thirty days each office

is to personally contact the responsible officer of every air

carrier and major terminal in its division to re-emphasize the

scope of this statute, Bureau jurisdiction and the necessity of

utilizing procedures which will insure all violations are reported

directly and immediately to the appropriate field office. The

Bureau is to be advised upon completion of these contacts.

(E) VENUE OVER OFFENSES NOT COMMITTED IN ANY DISTRICT, (TITLE 18,

SECTION 3238, UNITED STATES CODE) CRIMES WITHIN THE MARITIME AND

TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES -- On May 23, 1903,

Public Law 88-27 was passed amending Title 18, Section 3238, which

section provides for venue over offenses not committed within any

State or district, by providing the trial of all offenses begun

or committed upon

the high seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction

of any particular State or district, shall be in the district in

which the offender, or any one of two or more joint offenders, is

arrested or is first brought; but if such offender or offenders

are not so arrested or brought into any district, an indictment or

Information may be filed in the district of the last known

residence of the offender or of any one of two or more joint

offenders, or if no such residence is known the indictment or

information may be filed in the District of Columbia.

It is now possible to prosecute joint offenders who have

violated Federal Law upon the high seas or elsewhere out of the

jurisdiction of any particular state or district, in any district

In which either of them is arrested or first brought. Also it is

possible to secure an indictment or file an information against

any of such joint offenders without waiting for him to be arrested

or brought into a judicial district which would suspend the running

of any applicable statute of limitations.

Appropriate manual changes are being prepared.

reflecting each contact with an informant, unless

there has been

a change in the type of information the informant

is in a positior

to furnish, the word

"Same" may be placed in the "Coverage

To obviate the necessity of reviewing previous FD-209s to ascertain

this data, Forms FD-237 and FD-238, the respective. Criminal and

Security Informant Review Sheets, are being revised to include a

"Coverage" block to facilitate the location of the necessary infor-

However, in estimating the capability of the informant,

the "Rating" block on Form FD-209 should show the specific evaluation

each time the form is executed, although abbreviations such as

"G"

for "Good" and "VG" for "Very Good" and so forth may be used.

(E) NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY ACT MATTERS -- The Fraud Section, Criminal

Division, Department of Justice, in an attempt to induce more

vigorous action by U.S. Attorneys

as regards prosecution of vio-

lations of the National Bankruptcy Act (NBA) is closely reviewing

all Bureau NBA reports with particular attention being given to

those wherein the U. S. Attorney declines prosecution. In connection

therewith the Department has adopted a form letter addressed to the

U. S. Attorney and signed by Assistant Attorney General, Criminal

Division, which states in part:

"It is our opinion that the declination as set

forth in the said FBI report does not conform to the

Bankruptcy Section of the United States Attorneys'

Manual, Title II, page 61.

This section requires

that in declining prosecution in bankruptcy matters

that cogent and reasonably detailed reasons for such

declination together with specific reference to the

facts of the case shall be reported to the Attorney

General. (1) by report to the FBI or (2) by letter

addressed to the Criminal Division, Department of

Justice.

In keeping with the foregoing, it is imperative that in

NBA cases wherein the U.S. Attorney declines prosecution that his

reasons for so doing are set forth in sufficient detail to permit

adequate evaluation thereof by the Department.

(F) : INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF GAMBLING DEVICES - DEPARTMENTAL

OPINION CONCERNING GAMBLING WHEELS - Based on an inquiry from the

field as to whether gambling wheels a device sometimes known as

a wheel of fortune) are gambling devices falling within the purview

of the Interstate Transportation of Gambling Devices Statute, the

Department has furnished an opinion that such gambling wheels do

fall, within the purview of the 1962 amendments to this statute.

This type of

gambling wheel contains a series of numbers,

which numbers correspond to a board on which a sum of money is placed

on a particular number by the participant or customer. After the

wheel is spun and stops on a particular number, the corresponding number

on the board determines the winner. The winner, in turn, receives

money or merchandise.

The Department advises the statute covers any mechanical

device which is designed and manufactured for use in connection with

gambling.

Further,

since the device is mechanical in nature it is

apparently designed primarily for use in connection with gambling,

as a result of the

application of an element of chance, money or property.

In view of the Department's opinion, when complaints are

received.concerning gambling wheels, develop the facts and promptly

contact the U.S. Attorney for his

prosecutive opinion.

At the

same time promptly advise the Bureau of such investigations.

Therefore, from now on, the Number Three

preferred.

In connection with the tabulation of time spent in the

office, in addition to those activities presently excluded, it will

no longer be necessary to include time spent therein on key inter-

views of subjects and witnesses, regularly scheduled conferences,

and the review of accountancy-type books and recoras.

Further, it will no longer be necessary for agents to

compute each day

the total time spent on the development of potential

criminal informants or potential security informants.

The elimination of these requirements in no way mitigates

the necessity to insure that time in the office is kept at an

absolute minimum and that agents are held accountable for any

unjustifiable time so spent.

(A) VISITS BY CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO FIELD OFFICES AND RESIDENT

AGENCIES -- On August 29, 1963, a group of Negroes, identified as the

"Freedom Now Movement," headed by Conrad J. Lynn, a New York attorney,

called at my office. Previously the Bureau had learned that this group might

possibly institute a "sit-in" demonstration.

The group, upon arrival at 9:10 a.m., was courteously greeted

and promptly ushered into my office.

At that time, Mr. Lynn indicated that the

Negro considered there was a lack of law enforcement on the part of the FBI,

particularly with respect to prosecution of state and city police officials in civil

rights cases. He, and other members of the group, talked about a number of

cases, asserting that the FBI had not measured up to its responsibilities. William

Worthy, a newspaperman who has been most critical of American foreign policy

and who in 1962 was found guilty of traveling from Cuba to Miami, Florida, with-

out a valid passport, was most sarcastic. He stated that he was disturbed that

the FBI had not "prosecuted" anyone as a result of the "literally hundreds of

bombings of Negro churches and homes throughout the country." Worthy added

that it was only fair to let me know there was a rising tide of criticism against

the FBI because of our failure to "prosecute." Worthy stated that while he was

making no threat, he prophesied that FBI offices would be picketed in the future.

He specifically mentioned the incident in which a demonstration was held at our

Resident Agency at Danville, Virginia.

I told the group that I was happy to have the opportunity to

answer their questions. I explained the FBI's jurisdiction and that we were

an investigative and not a prosecutive agency. I emphasized that our investi-

gations were penetrative in both the South and the North and that we constantly

impress upon our Agents that they must be completely objective in all investi-

gations, especially those involving civil rights. I told them that in many instances

erroneous statements are made by extremists concerning the FBI's role in the

civil rights field. I furnished facts regarding some specific cases they men-

tioned, and have since forwarded a letter to the leader of this group setting

forth the facts in each case. As it turned out, the FBI had previously investi-

gated each case the group brought up and the results of our investigations had

• been forwarded to the Department of Justice for consideration as to prosecution

or further action.

The possibility exists that representatives of the "Freedom Now

Movement'' or other groups might call at our Field Offices or Resident Agencies.

If they do, they are to be promptly and courteously received. The Special Agent

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 585

## Page 586

in Charge or the Senior Resident Agent, if available, is to conduct the interview.

The group should be allowed to state the reason for its visit and its complaints

heard. The Bureau's jurisdiction in the civil rights field should be thoroughly

explained and questions in regard to the specific cases mentioned answered.

If the interviewing Bureau official does not possess the facts on the cases, the

group should be told that he will promptly check the matter and advise it of the

true facts. Keep in mind the possibility of furnishing the group literature such

as my recent article in the August, 1963, issue of "Yale Political" magazine

concerning civil rights. At all times, the group should receive courteous

attention and every effort made to assist its members in understanding the

FBI's role in the civil rights field. The Bureau should be promptly advised

of each such interview.

It is felt that by such an approach, not only can the Bureau

forestall any "sit-ins" and unfavorable publicity, but do much to enable Negro

leaders to understand the true role of the FBI in these investigations.

One Field Division recently conducted a very successful three-day

seminar for police training directors which evoked considerable

interest and enthusiasm.

Purpose of seminar was to bring together

local law enforcement training directors for purpose of discussing

teaching methods, techniques and training programs. Attendance

was restricted to officers who handle training in their departments;

the 30 men in attendance represented 28 law enforcement agencies.

Although we coordinated the program and presented a substantial

amount of the instruction, several competent, cooperative police

training directors led discussions on topics

headed by CPUSA General Secretary Gus Hall to many rank-and-file

members, is clear indication of the Party's favorite target (the

Negro) today.

All indications are that the March was not the "end

of the line" and that the Party will step up its efforts to exploit

racial unrest and in every possible way claim credit for itself

relating to any

, "gains"

A clear-cut

indication of

the Party's designs is revealed in secret information

obtained from a most sensitive source that the Party plans to hold

a highly secretive leadership meeting in November, 1903, which will

deal primarily with the Negro situation. The Party has closely guardec

plans for Gus Hall to undertake a "barnstorming" trip through key

areas of the country to meet Party people and thus better prepare

himself for the November meeting.

In order for the Bureau to cope with the Party's efforts

• and thus fulfill our responsibilities in the security field, it is

necessary that we at once intensify our coverage of communist

influence on the Negro.

Fullest consideration should be given to

the use of all possible investigative techniques in the investigation

of the CPUSA, those communist fronts through which the Party channels

its

influence, and the many individual Party members and dupes.

There is also an urgent need for imaginative and aggressive tactics

•to be utilized through our Counterintelligence Program for the

purpose of attempting to neutralize or disrupt the Party's

activities in the Negro field.

Because of the Bureau's responsibility

for timely dissemination of pertinent information to the Department

and

other interested agencies, it is more than ever necessary that

all facets of this matter receive prompt handling.

Because of the Party's intensified efforts to render in-

fluence in racial matters, the Bureau is closing its

subfile 100-3-75

relating to CPUSA - Negro

Question. All information to be reported

relating to the Negro question,

well as communist influence in

racial matters, should be hereafter reported in Bureau file 100-3-116

relating

to CPUSA, Negro Question - Communist Influence in Racial

Matters.

This instruction as to the administrative handling of

this matter is effective immediately and should be followed in the

(F) . SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - INTERNAL SECURITY -

SAC Letter 63-39 dated August 6, 1953, provided a subversive organi-

zation characterization for the Progressive Labor Movement.

Set

forth below is an up-to-date characterization of this organization

which replaces the one in SAC Letter 63-39. This thumbnail sketch

also encompasses the Progressive Labor Party and the Movement's

publication,

"Progressive Labor," which are integral parts of the

entire organization.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY;

@PROGRESSIVE LABOR MOVEMENT;

"PROGRESSIVE LABOR"

A source advised on July 2, 1962, that Progressive Labor

groups held a conference in New York City on July 1, 1902, where

Milton Rosen acted as chairman. He read a statement at this con-

ference setting forth their intention to form a new Marxist-Leninist

Party in the United States. Rosen stated that a more formal

organization was necessary, one which would provide a framework for

vanguard. The functions of this new organization are to consolidate

all existing forces around Progressive Labor and organize additional

forces; expand and improve political activities; win additional forces

to an outlook of Marxism-Leninism and increase

• the open advocacy of

socialism; develop a significant Marxist-Leninist program for the

new party; and organize a collective organization of leaders and

members.

"The Worker,"

newspaper, issue of January 7, 1902,

A second and third source advised in February, 1963,

that this new Marxist-Leninist Party had not yet been organized on

a formal basis but that Progressive Labor groups had been formed

In several localities in line with proposals of Milton Rosen.

The

sources advised as of February, 1963, that the leaders of this group

were referring

; to it as the Progressive Labor Movement.

The "Amsterdam News," a daily New York City newspaper, dated

27, 1963, page 22, set forth that the "Progressive Labor Party

is a new political formation based on Progressive Labor Movement,

a Socialist organization with groups in all parts of the United

States.

The organization publishes a monthly magazine called

Progressive Labor.

(A) EMERGENCY MEDICAL IDENTIFICATION CARDS -- The American

Medical Association has approved the use of a universal symbol to be used

as a warning that any individual wearing or carrying it suffers from a

physical disability or illness requiring special care such as, diabetes,

epilepsy, allergy to certain drugs or medications, et cetera. The symbol

may appear on an identification card or be affixed to a bracelet, pin, or

similar ornamental device and consists of a hexagon on which has been

superimposed a six-sided cross, "the Star of Life," on the upright arm

of which is a staff with a serpent entwined about it, "the Staff of Aesculapius."

Although the American Medical Association is unable to state the

extent of the use of the symbol, it has and will be given considerable publicity.

POLICE TRAINING -- Bureau has learned that a brochure has been forwarded

Institute (NAI) will present, during 1964, a series of two-week training

schools on police subjects for municipal, county, State and Federal law

enforcement officers having arrest powers, and for foreign officials having

law enforcement duties. This brochure gives no irdication who will be

connected with NAI; however, it was determined it is apparently a private

undertaking by Neal M. Forney, a National Academy graduate no longer

active in law enforcement, and has no connection with any law enforcement

agency, organization or college. Forney plans to set up his Institute in

Washington, D. C., but has indicated he will present instruction in other

areas, if requested. Registration for the initial school closes 1/13, 64;

tuition for each school will be $185.

You should make no comment at this time concerning this proposed

police training organization, but you should be alert for information regarding

Forney and NAI and advise the Bureau promptly. You are again reminded to

insure that the police training program of your office is meeting the training

needs of local law enforcement in your area.

. (C) "BANK ROBBERY MATTERS - It has been suggested that bait money

used by banks should be made up of used Federal Reserve Notes emanating

from Federal Reserve Districts far removed from the area in which the

bait money is being used. It is felt this procedure would help our bank

robbery investigations in that it would be easier for tellers in other banks

to check bills received against lists of stolen bait money. Sirce each Federal

Reserve Note contains a large letter on its face denoting the Federal Reserve

District from which it came, and those from districts far removed from

locality in question would be received in relatively small volumes, the money

used in bait packages could be more easily detected.

Accordingly, this proposal is brought to your attention for discussion

with appropriate officials of banking institutions within your territory during

the normal course of business or in connection with field conferences.

(D) HOODLUM COVERAGE IN THE GREATER MIAMI, FLORIDA, AREA

DURING WINTER SEASON 1963-1964 - CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE

PROGRAM -- The Miami Office has been making plans to affora coverage

of the activities of out-of-town hoodlums who may visit the Miami area during

the coming winter season. These plans include the utilization of informants

and sources in places frequented by racketeers and development of information

to establish highly confidential investigative techniques.

To assist the Miami Office in the prompt establishment of effective

coverage on hoodlums and racketeers proceeding to the Miami area, field

offices are instructed to furnish to the Miami Office background information,

including criminal records, physical descriptions and details of itineraries

of such hoodlums. When information is received from highly sensitive sources

or informants concerning the travel of any hoodlum, appropriate precautions

should be set forth to enable the Miami Office to plan investigative steps which

will not jeopardize these sources and informants. Information on travel plans

should be forwarded expeditiously by appropriate communication to enable the

Miami Office to have as much notice as possible to provide coverage on the

activities of these individuals where facts have been developed indicating the

desirability of such coverage. To make coverage more efficient and discreet,

the information developed should include identity of associates the traveling

• hoodlums are expected to meet in the Miami area.

All surveillances instituted

must be discreet and based on information from which it can logically be

inferred that there is a definite, useful objective to be achieved.

All offices should furnish a brief outline to Miami of public source

data identifying any of these individuals as racketeers or members of organized

criminal groups, such as La Cosa Nostra, to be made available, if necessary,

to local law enforcement officials.

It should be borne in mind that hoodlums from various parts of the

country visiting the Miami area will be renewing associations, reminiscing

about past experiences and discussing future plans. This recreation atmosphere

should provide better opportunities for our informants and sources to obtain

valuable information in accordance with the objectives of the Criminal

Intelligence Program.

When notifying the Bureau and Miami Office of the intended travel

of hoodlums, each field office should include information on the availability of

any highly placed informants in a position to travel to Florida to provide coverage

of hoodlum activities. The Bureau will thereafter decide if the travel of a

particular informant is warranted.

(B) REPORT WRITING -- To avoid unnecessary dictation and typing,

the attention of all investigative personnel should be directed to the

general reporting rules set forth in the Handbook for FBI Agents.

Particular emphasis should be placed on the provisions embodied in

Part I, item 47, A, 10 and 11, on pages 32c and 32d of the Handbook

as they relate to the use of inserts by auxiliary offices to report the

results of investigations to an office of origin.

Good judgment should dictate the use of inserts wherever

possible to report iniormation ultimately destined for inclusion in a report.

This will relieve the office preparing the report of the necessity of

wholesale retyping of information to include it therein as is the case

when the data is received from the auxiliary office in an airtel, letter,

or similar communication.

(D PHOTOGRAPHS - INVESTIGATIVE AID -- It has been brought to our

attention that the State of Montana has adopted the practice of requiring

that a photograph of the driver be attached to the operator and chauffeur

driving licenses issued by it. The licenses expire every two years and

applicants are photographed at the time of initial application and each

renewal. Montana thus joins several other states which have this

requirement and, with the increasing trend toward uniformity in

licensing procedures, it is anticipated that many more states will adopt

this requirement in the future.

I need not elaborate on the value to our investigations of

up-to-date photographs of subjects, suspects, et cetera, and you are

reminded that all logical sources of obtaining them, such as that

described above, should be exploited whenever possible.

(F) SECURITY INDEX -- In connection with all security investigations

in the case of individual subjects, the essential question for determination

is whether the subject's activities are such as to depict him to be a

potential danger to the national security of the United States in time

of an emergency. In the event such a determination is made, his name

should be included in the Security Index.

The Security Index criteria have been found to afford

practical and workable guidelines in arriving at a conclusion as to

whether a subject represents a potential danger and are sufficiently

elastic so that when applied with the necessary judgment, the complex

questions which may arise in connection with these cases can be

resolved.

Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions contains a number

of specific factors that must betaken into consideration when arriving

For your assistance, the assistance of your investigative

personnel engaged in security work, and for the assistance of your

supervisory staff, the following specific factors, in addition to the ones

presently enumerated in Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions, are

set forth for consideration in arriving at a determination as to whether :.

a security subject falls within the Security Index criteria, represents

The above factors, including the various factors presently

set forth in Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions, are not all-inclusive

but are set forth for the purpose of providing a more detailed guideline

and all must be considered in evaluating the facts developed during

the course of the investigation.

In view of our responsibilities in the internal security field,

most careful attention must be afforded this aspect of our operations

and all security cases should be closely examined for the purpose of

determining whether sufficient facts are available to depict the subject

as a dangerous person whose activities warrant the inclusion of his

name in the Security Index. When such a determination is made,

appropriate recommendation to include his name in the Security Index

should be made promptly.

sessions are effective media whereby the graduates can be allied more closely

to each other and to the Bureau in meeting our common problems.

Your attention is directed to Part II, Section 1 B, 13, page 12, of

the Manual of Rules and Regulations concerning the attendance of Bureau

personnel at FBI National Academy retraining sessions. These instructions

must be closely followed.

(C) 'VISIT OF HER MAJESTY QUEEN FREDERIKA OF GREECE TO

UNITED STATES, JANUARY, 1964 -- Her Majesty Queen Frederika of

Greece, her daughter, Princess Irene, and a small entourage are scheduled

to visit the United States between January 21 and February 7, 1964.

Present itinerary indicates she will be in New York City January 21-26,

1964, and will be in Washington, D. C., January 20-30, 1964. from

January 31, 1964, to February 7, 1964, her itinerary is not firm, but

could include visits to Cape Kennedy, Florida; Boston, Massachusetts;

and New York City. She is scheduled to leave the United States on

February 7, 1964, from New York City by ship. Although Her Majesty

will tour the United States in a private capacity, the Department of State

will implement and request security protection and measures that are

normally extended to a foreign head of state.

Department of State is concerned about her safety in view of

the harassing and embarrassing actions taken against her during her two

visits to England in 1963. Reportedly, demonstrations were made by the

militant "Committee of 100" which is demanding the release of certain

political prisoners in Greece. It was indicated these demonstrations were

communist inspired and that similar demonstrations may be attempted

during her visit to the United States. A second point of concern is that

in connection with her contemplated visit to Barnard College, Columbia

University, New York City: on January 22, 1964, there may be organized

efforts to create embarrassing incidents since in October, 1963, an article

appeared in the Columbia University newspaper alleging that Her Majesty

was a Nazi sympathizer during World War II.

State Department has requested FBI and other appropriate

Government agencies concerned to explore possible existence of any effort

by the Communist Party, USA, communist front organizations or any

dissident groups to create any incidents which could prove dangerous to the

personal safety of Her Majesty or prove embarrassing to her and to the

United States Government. Accordingly, all offices should immediately

contact any informants and sources in a position to furnish information of

this nature and forward to the Bureau in a form suitable for dissemination

any pertinent data so developed.

Informants and sources in a position to acquire such data in the

future should be alerted to the necessity for prompt reporting. Information

concerning threats, violence or hostile demonstrations against Her Majesty,

her entourage or her government should be immediately furnished to the

Bureau, to appropriate local police, to appropriate local office of security,

D) HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW -- The January-February, 1964, issue of

the above-captioned magazine contains my article entitled "The U. S. Business-

man Faces the Soviet Spy. " This article discusses in detail efforts by Soviet

diplomats to make personal and friendly contact with American businessmen

and how they hope to exploit these contacts to secure information of value to

them. The article also sets forth suggestions on how citizens can help the FBI

defeat these Soviet spy efforts.

This article should be considered as a possible investigative aid

in espionage cases. In the past, the Bureau has received valuable information

from individuals who had read my previous but shorter articles on this topic.

Any such cases resulting from this article should promptly be called to the

Bureau's attention; mark for the attention of Crime Records Division.

Three copies of the article are being furnished to each field

office. The Bureau has limited supply of additional copies. If more copies

are desired, they should be requested.

(E) RACIAL INFORMANTS -- New Manual of Instructions and FBI Handbook

sections containing detailed instructions regarding the handling of racial

informants and sources have been prepared. Classification 170 has been

assigned. Upon receipt of these new sections, each field office will review

all pending cases on racial informants and make necessary changes in files

and indices to conform with the new classification number and instructions.

Effective upon receipt of the forthcoming manual changes

include in your monthly report of all expenditures from the confidential

fund the total amount paid each month to racial informants and sources.

This separate category for payments to racial informants and

sources will appear in the portion of your monthly report entitled "Summary

of Payments to Informants and Sources" and should be shown in the same

manner that you now show breakdown of information relative to criminal

and security informants and sources.

The effectiveness of the Racial Informant Program is your

personal responsibility and it will be incumbent upon you to implement the

new instructions and to achieve positive results.

jurisdiction in such matters, and to highlight to the general public, through

well-planned publicity, our interest and responsibilities in this field. The

curriculum of the schools may include such topics as The Automobile Theft

Problem (including most recent statistics), FBI Jurisdiction in ITSMV

Cases, Modus Operandi of Auto Thieves, How to Spot a Stolen Car, and

Processing Stolen Cars for Evidence. Also, a representative of the

National Automobile Theft Bureau may be invited to participate in the

schools, to explain how his Bureau may be of assistance. Each field

division has films which are appropriate for use in such schools.

While these specialized schools are not to be solicited, you

should bring them to the attention of law enforcement agencies in your

division. Law enforcement organizations, such as Chiefs and Sheriffs

Associations, may be interested in cooperating in arrangements for a

series of these specialized schools.

(E) ESPIONAGE INVESTIGATIONS -- Espionage violations in which there is

no apparent participation by or with a foreign government can involve misuse,

unauthorized disclosure, theft or photographing of material relating to the

national defense (Title 18, Section 793, 795, 796, 797, 798, United States

Code). These are carried under the Espionage - X character. In investi-

gating these cases it is imperative that it be borne in mind that the illegal

act may have been committed at the request or behest of a foreign agent

although the person committing the violation was unaware of the foreign

ramification. There are numerous instances in Bureau files in which

an American citizen who was also an agent of a foreign principal requested

another American who was unaware of this foreign connection to obtain

information concerning the national defense either because of friendship

or for financial gain. If the Espionage - X investigation discloses that

an agent of a foreign principal is involved, it could very well mean that

foreign ramifications are present which could increase the importance of

the case as well as the degree of possible damage to the national defense.

You should assure that Espionage - X cases receive thorough and complete

investigative action and that it is resolved during these investigations

whether there are any foreign ramifications.

SAC LETTER NO. 64-4

(F) INTERNAL SECURITY - NATIONALISTIC TENDENCY -- Section 105B,

Manual of Instructions, points out that one of the aims of our investigations

in the Nationalistic Field is to develop information concerning conditions

in foreign countries. This Section instructs that an effort should be made

to obtain this type of information as it might have a bearing on the current

or future policy of the United States toward such countries or might aid

the intelligence agencies to engage more effectively in counterintelligence

activities. Except in very rare and unusual instances information of this

type is, of course, given wide dissemination by the Bureau immediately

upon its receipt.

A glance at almost any current newspaper will establish the

fact that revolutionary activity is rampant in foreign countries, particularly

in the Caribbean and Latin-American areas. The concern of State Department

and other Government agencies is obvious.

Field offices have frequently

received allegations of an apparently significant nature from a confidential

informant or source and in most instances have promptly forwarded.such

information to the Bureau. It has been noted, however, that on occasions

1/21/64

SAC LETTER NO. 64-4

- 3 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 621

---

## Page 622

where time was deemed of the essence as, for example, where an

invasion of a foreign country was allegedly imminent, the Bureau has

been furnished a summary by teletype or by other expeditious means but

the teletype failed to state whether the information should be classified

and/or that details would follow immediately in form suitable for

dissemination. In such instances these points should be covered in

the original communication and full details should be expeditiously

forwarded.

Too frequently allegations indicating a critical situation exists

have been received from sources and forwarded to the Bureau without

indicating whether the field is taking any action to corroborate or further

develop the information. The field must recognize that the Government

may go to considerable expense and effort as a result of receiving

one of these allegations and the field must assume the responsibility,

without prodding from the Bureau, of promptly checking these allegations

out wherever possible.

The original communication to the Bureau or

the cover airtel where letterhead memorandum is used must spell out

just what is being done by the field in this regard.

A large part of our information in these cases comes from

exiled nationals of the countries involved. The field is reminded that

such information may be colored by the individual prejudices and

loyalties of such sources and that, therefore, their information cannot

be accepted at face value. They must be pinned down to actual facts

in their possession. In this connection the Bureau has noted an increasing

laxity on the part of the field in this type of case to properly attribute

information to sources. Where a source does not possess information

as of his own knowledge the communication must not permit the inference

that this is the case. It should be determined how and from whom the

source obtained his information and, wherever possible, this data should

be included in the memorandum or report prepared for dissemination.

You are instructed to bring the above matters to the attention

of all Agents handling cases in the Nationalistic Tendency Field.

John Edgar Hoover

(D) FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION MATTERS -- Effective

February 1, 1964, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is tightening

up on certain certifications relative to homé improvement loans, it insures

under its Title I program.

For example, all borrowers, makers and cosigners

must henceforth sign the completion certificate and the borrower's authorization

certificate. Application for credit forms have been revised to include an

amplified certificate by the salesman and by any person other than the borrower

who prepares the application. In addition, the completion certificate has been

strengthened by requiring a certification by the dealer that he has paid all his

bills in connection with the work done or that he will do so within sixty days.

FHA has also informed Title I lending institutions that they will be

expected to inspect one out of each ten home improvement jobs performed by

a dealer for at least six months after approving same. Thereafter, spot checks

are to be made as frequently as necessary to assure fidelity of the dealer's

performance.

The foregoing new regulations should provide more data as to identity

of persons responsible for preparation of forms and should cause lending

institutions to take an active part in processing loans they insure in behalf of

the Government. Since old forms may continue to be used in these cases, you

must be careful to differentiate between the varying language of the certificates

thereon.

These new instructions provide a suitable opportunity for discussion

of FHA Matters with lending institutions, which are usually the first to learn of

indicated violations. Effective liaison with such sources will assist your office

in getting criminal cases more promptly through simultaneous notification of

the FBI as well as FHA in such investigations.

Vigorous efforts should be made

to arrange for such prompt referrals. As you have been previously instructed,

all cases in this classification must continue to receive expeditious, vigorous

and imaginative attention.

(A) SURVEILLANCES - RADIO TRANSMISSIONS -- You have been reminded

repeatedly of the possibility that FBI radio transmissions may be heard by un-

authorized individuals and that FM radio transmissions must be discreet at all

times. Standing instructions in this regard are set out in Paragraph 9, Chapter

4, Part II, FBI Handbook, and are reiterated here for emphasis:

"FM radio transmissions must be discreet and names of Agents:

subjects, or specific locations involved in Bureau investigative

activities must not be disclosed.

Credential card numbers should

be used where identity of Agents is necessary in station-to-car

and car-to-station operation. Two-way car call signs should

be used for identification in other operations although coded

names or call signs may be used as necessary in surveillance-

type operations."

During a recent sensitive surveillarce in an extremely important

criminal case FBI radio transmissions were monitored by the subject of the

surveillance. Notes made by the intercepter of these transmissions have been

introduced in court. These notes disclose that in many instances the Agents

did not abide by the above instructions. First names and/or initials of

surveillance Agents were used; the subject of the surveillance was mentioned

by first or last name; and general as well as specific locations of surveillance

cars were reported without any attempt to prevent disclosure. Uncalled for

and unnecessary remarks, among other things, also were recorded by the

subject of the surveillance. Needless to say, this interception and divulgence

of our radio communications has resulted in considerable embarrassment.

It is desired that this situation be brought to the attention of all

personnel and the instructions as set cut above reiterated. In addition, you

are to personally examine the manner in which your FM radio facilities are

being utilized to insure that the operation of such facilities is in strict

accordance with existing Bureau instructions.

(A) INCOME TAX RETURNS - EXCLUSION OF SICK PAY - FBÌ FORM

BOOK -- The recent revision by Congress of the Federal income tax law

changes the regulations concerning the exclusion of sick pay from taxable

income. Insofar as Bureau employees are concerned, pay received for

all periods of absences for sick purposes beginning on or after January 1,

1964, will not be excludable unless an absence exceeds thirty calendar

days

Then only the pay for the portion of the absence in excess of thirty

calendar days can be excluded. The maximum allowable exclusion is still

$100 per week. Pay for any period of absence due to illness which began

prior to January 1, 1964, can still be excluded under the former regulations,

regardless of its duration Form FD-307, Application for Sick Leave

Statement, has been revised Enclosed are three copies of such form,

one copy of which should be placed in the FBI Form Book. All employees

of your office should be advised of this change in regulations.

You should assure that employees having excludable sick pay for

absence beginning prior to January 1, 1964, submit their application on the

form now in your office. Any remaining copies of the form should then be

destroyed and the necessary supply of the revised form ordered from the

(B) FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM -- There will

be a limited opportunity registration period between now and 6-30-64 for

employees who were not enrolled on 3-17-64 to enroll in a health benefit plan

and employees who on 3-17-64 were enrolled for self only to change to a

family enrollment in the same plan or option. The effective date of enrollments

or changes in enrollment due to this limited opportunity registration period

will be the first day of the pay period following the pay period the Health

Benefits Registration Form (SF 2809) is received. On these registrations

"P L." should be placed under "Remarks" of the SF 2809.

The following changes in the Federal Employees Health Benefits

Act were made possible by Public Law 88-254 which was approved on 3-17-64.

Effective 3-17-64 unmarried children up to age 21 (instead of age 19) and

foster children are included under an employee's family enrollment in the

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 628

---

## Page 629

Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). To be considered

a foster child, the child must be living with the employee in a parent-child

relationship and the employee must intend to rear the child indefinitely

into adulthood as if he were his own. Coverage is automatic and all plans

will honor claims for medical care received on or after 3-17-64. Employees

who are enrolled in a group-practice or individual-practice plan should

write the plan giving the name and date of birth of any eligible foster child

and any child aged 19 to 21. Employees enrolled in any other plan need

take no action unless their plan requests this information.

Effective 6-21-64 the family-female with nondependent husband-

enrollment will be dropped and female employees will be eligible to enroll

in the regular family plan and will receive the same Government contribution

($3.12 per pay period) as male employees enrolled in the family plan. It

will not be necessary for a female employee enrolled in the family plan to

execute an SF 2809 to change her enrollment code number, The adjustment

will be automatic and will first appear in the pay check dated 7-17-64.

Under separate cover you will be sent notices concerning these changes

to be attached to the SE 2809 A's.

Employees aged 19 to 21, who enrolled for self only because upon

attainment of age 19 they lost coverage under a parent's family enrollment

under the FEHBP, should immediately execute an SF 2809 to cancel their

enrollment because they are now covered under a parent's family enrollment

until age 21. Before cancelling his enrollment the employee should ensure

that his parent is still enrolled in a plan under the FEHBP. Upon attainment

of age 21 these employees will again be eligible to enroll for self only since

they will lose their coverage under the parent's enrollment in the FEHBP.

The employees will not be notified when they or a member of their family loses

coverage. It is the employees responsibility to follow and make any changes

which would affect their enrollment. Appropriate arrangements are being

made by the SAMBA Office concerning employees with children aged 19 to 21

enrolled in the SAMBA Student Health Benefit Plan and who are affected by

these changes.

An employee enrolled in a plan under the FEHBP who purchased

a conversion contract for a child who is not yet 21 should get in touch with

his plan to cancel the conversion contract. The child will have a new

conversion right when he reaches age 21 or his coverage as a family member

terminates by marriage.

without evidence of insurability. Those applying for the additional amounts

of $4,000 or $9, 000 must execute the Personal Health Statement.

Those

You should personally ensure that the changes in the law and

this limited opportunity registration period are brought to the attention of

each employee in your office. There will not be any brochures issued in

connection with this registration period. The Health Benefits Representative

should carefully review all forms prior to submission to the Bureau.

(C) REPORT WRITING -- A recent Federal decision underscores the wisdom

of the Bureau's long-standing policy that information favorable to the defense

must be reported as completely and accurately as that favorable to the

prosecution.

In U. S. ex rel. Meers v. Wilkins, 326 F. 2d 135 (1964), the

Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, held that suppression by the

prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused violates due process of law

and requires reversal of the conviction. In this case, two witnesses to a

robbery saw the defendant in police custody after arrest and "positively

stated to the police" that the defendant was not the robber. These witnesses

were not called by the prosecution and did not appear at trial. Two other

witnesses positively identified the defendant. Convicted, the defendant

moved for a new trial, submitting an affidavit of assigned counsel that counsel

did not learn of the existence of the two uncalled witnesses until after trial

had ended. After defendant exhausted his state remedies without relief, he

brought habeas corpus in Federal district court where it was held that the

prosecution had a duty to disclose the existence of the two witnesses favorable

to the defense, and that failure to do so violated due process of law. The

Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.

Although Wilkins was a state case, the result would have been the

same had it been a Federal case. The due process clause in the Fifth

Amendment, applicable to Federal officers, and that in the Fourteenth

Amendment, applicable to state officers; are of identical meaning.

## Page 631

The rule announced in Wilkins springs from Supreme Court

decisions holding that due process is violated by (1) conviction obtained

through use of knowingly false and perjured testimony, Mooney v. Holohan,

• 294 U. S. 103 (1935), (2) failure to correct unsolicited false testimony for

the prosecution after discovery of its falsity, Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S.

264 (1959), and (3) suppression of evidence favorable to the accused upor

request of the accused for that evidence, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S.

83 (1963).

The Wilkins decision places upon the U. S. Attorney an affirmative

duty to disclose to the defense at least the existence of potential witnesses

and other evidence for the defense that are known to him. He cannot perform

that duty, however, unless the reports are so complete and accurate that

he is able to identify such witnesses and evidence therein.

The significance of Wilkins for this Bureau is that reports in all

cases must be so complete that they will serve to identify potential witnesses

for the defense, state their observations with sufficient precision to make

the position which they take clear to the U. S. Attorney, and similarly

identify any other evidence for the defense encountered during the investigation.

This includes, as held in Brady, evidence which is "material either to guilt or

to punishment. "

Statements of witnesses in any way favorable to the defense must

be reported on form FD-302 just as are those of witnesses for the prosecution.

It may be held that the defense can call for those statements. 34 Federal Rules

Decisions 88 (1964).

The reporting must be as clear and as free from equivocation or

ambiguity as the information encountered by the Agent will permit. For

example, if a witness to a bank robbery sees the defendant after arrest and

states that the defendant is not the robber, a report that the witness "failed

to identify" the robber would be defective; the quoted words would not

correctly show the position taken by the witness and hence would not put

the U. S. Attorney on notice that the witness is potentially one for the defense.

The cited decisions and these instructions are not to be interpreted

as requiring the government to make an investigation for the defense. They

go no further (for FBI purposes) than to require that if, while making the

usual and proper investigation for the government, we come upon evidence

of any kind seemingly favorable to the defendant, we must report the

(D) LAW ENFORCEMENT CONFERENCES, 1964 - "THE FLEEING

FELON" -- Law Enforcement Conferences in 1964 will concern fugitive

investigations; they will be called "The Fleeing Felon" conferences.

Subject matter will encompass assistance FBI can render to local law

enforcement under the Fugitive Felon Act and through other cooperative

functions, and principles involved in fugitive investigations. Schedule

sufficient conferences to cover your territory adequately; wherever

possible, utilize sites that are readily accessible to local law enforcement

and others invited to your conferences. Conferences should be held

between September 15 and November 1, 1964; adjoining offices should be

advised of your conference plans; border offices may invite nearby

Canadian and Mexican police officials. Conference agenda should be

limited to four to six hours; should be of the open-forum type, with

necessary talks restricted to 15 minutes; audience participation should

be encouraged. Qualified speakers from local law enforcement, prosecutors,

and related fields, may be used as panelists; names of contemplated panelists

should be checked through your indices and the Bureau advised of the resuits.

Attendance of undesirables should be avoided, and representatives of

commercial concerns should not be invited.

:

You are authorized to prepare friendly but businesslike circular

letters of invitation to be sent to police officials, sheriffs' departments,

penal institutions, state correctional agencies, local and state prosecutors,

and others in related fields who might refer unlawful flight matters to the

Bureau.

You may desire to utilize police instructors in the planning of

interesting and informative programs; however, you should preside at each

conference personally. Potential curricula topics are:

Agenda of your proposed conferences, listing all speakers to be

invited, as well as dates and sites, should be submitted to the Bureau on UACB

basis at least 30 days prior to holding of your first conference. Advise Bureau

by June 15 of tentative plans as to where and when your conferences will be

held. A national press release will be made regarding these conferences;

do not disclose subject matter or planning until after national press release;

you will be provided with a copy of the national release and will be authorized

to make appropriate releases locally.

Conferences should be closed to all but duly constituted law

enforcement personnel and those in related fields who have a bona fide interest

in fugitive matters. Designate a period, either immediately before or after

each conference, to be open to news media representatives, during which you

may explain the purposes and accomplishments of the conference; the interest

of news media should be encouraged.

Material for distribution at your conferences, such as Law

Enforcement Bulletin reprints, etc., should be ordered by routing slip from

Crime Records Division as early as possible. Bureau will not be able to

prepare special exhibits or posters; do not incur expenses for rental of

space, etc., without prior Bureau authority.

(E) CASES CLOSED UPON AUTHORITY OF SAC - REPORT WRITING -- I

wish to re-emphasize my concern over premature closing of unsolved cases.

• In order to insure the Bureau has fulfilled its responsibilities under the law,

it is imperative that every step be taken to make certain that existing .

instructions are fully complied with.

It was necessary to require that no unsolved bank robbery cases

be closed upon authority of the Special Agent in Charge (SAC), and if

present regulations are not strictly adhered to it will become necessary

to remove all authority to close cases by the SAC. The importance of

this matter should be clearly understood by all employees. As you are

aware, the closing of cases upon SAC authority will be checked into

in connection with inspections and any derelictions will be subject to

appropriate administrative action.

(D) SEARCHES AND SEIZURES -- Two unanimous search and seizure

decisions handed down by the Supreme Court on March 23, 1964, must

be brought to the attention of all investigative personnel.

Both are

important and one makes a significant change in the law.

In Stoner v. California, police officers entered the subject's

hotel room, by consent of the night clerk; after being advised by the clerk

that the subject was out of the room as shown by his room key being in

the mailbox. The officers searched the room and took several articles

which were used as evidence at trial. The subject was arrested in

another state two days later.

The conviction was reversed on the ground that the evidence

taken from the hotel room was obtained by a search and seizure which

was unreasonable because it was based on consent of the hotel clerk

rather than consent of the subject.

"No less than a tenant of a house,

or the occupant of a room in a boarding house, a guest in a hotel room

is entitled to constitutional protection against unreasonable searches

and seizures." The tenant has the possessory right in the room which

he has rented, and that right is one "which only the petitioner (subject)

could waive by word or deed, either directly or through an agent."

There was in this case, as in most, no evidence to indicate that the

tenant had authorized the clerk to consent to a search of the tenant's

room.

The Stoner decision only reiterates the prevailing rule on

this point.

In Preston v. U. S., four police officers of a small city arrested

three men in a parked car at 3:00 a.m. on vagrancy charges. The car was

not searched at the time of arrest. It was driven by an officer to the station,

from which it was towed to a garage. Soon after the subjects were booked

at the station, some of the police officers went to the garage to search

the car and found two loaded revolvers in the glove compartment. They

were unable to open the trunk and returned to the station, where a detective

told one of the officers to go back and try to get into the trunk. The officer

did so, was able to enter the trunk through the back seat of the car, and

in the trunk found various items adapted to the perpetration of a robbery.

After the searches, one of the men confessed that he and two others intended

to rob a bank nearby. At this point Bureau Agents were called in and

the materials found in the car were turned over to them. It was contended

by the defense that the use of these materials at trial violated the Fourth

Amendment.

The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, stating that the

search of the car was unreasonable and the evidence obtained thereby was

inadmissible. The search of the car was unreasonable because it was

made at a time and place different from that of the arrest and thus was

"simply not incident to the arrest." Search of a vehicle or fixed premises

incidental to arrest therein must be made contemporaneously with the arrest -

following the arrest and at the same place. Searches of such places inci-

dental to arrest are an exception to the basic rule that all such searches

must be made by search warrant. Once the car in this case had been taken

to the garage under police custody, the subjects could no longer use any

weapons therein to attack the officers, nor destroy the evidence therein,

nor hide the car from the police. The reason for granting an exception to

the basic rule requiring searches by search warrant had disappeared.

The Government's brief before the Supreme Court in this case

cited three earlier Federal decisions allowing search of a vehicle, inci-

dental to arrest, at a time and place different from that of arrest where

neither the time nor the distance was great. These decisions, although

not mentioned in the opinion, must be taken as overruled.

An alternative method of searching the vehicle in situations like

this is by consent. Consent searches, however, are:only another exception

to the basic rule that searches must be made by search warrant. The

....

genuinely voluntary consent necessary to sustain a consent search often is

difficult to prove, and particularly so in the case of a person under arrest

and denying guilt.

The vehicle searched here was owned by one of the subjects

and lawfully occupied by all three. This was not a stolen car case. A

thief or other trespasser, having no legal right to occupy the vehicle or

other place searched has no rights which can be violated by search of the

vehicle or place. It will be assumed that this rule continues for stolen

vehicle cases since the court did not decide that issue in this case.

(F) FALSE ADVERTISING OR MISUSE OF NAME TO INDICATE FEDERAL

AGENCY -- Section 19 of the Peace Corps Act was amended by the 88th

Congress and approved by the President on December 13, 1963. The

provisions of the amendment are set forth as follows:

Section 19 of the Peace Corps Act, as amended, which relates

to the Peace Corps seal, is amended by striking out the short title and

substituting therefor "Exclusive Right to Seal and Name", by inserting

"(a)" before "The President may," and by adding a new subsection as

follows:

"(b) (1) The use of the official seal or emblem and the use

of the name "Peace Corps' shall be restricted exclusively to designate

programs authorized under this Act.

"(2) Whoever, whether an individual, partnership, corporation,

or association, uses the seal for which provision is made in this section,

or any sign, insignia, or symbol in colorable imitation thereof, or the

words 'Peace Corps'

or any combination of these or other words or

characters in colorable imitation thereof, other than to designate programs

authorized under this Act, shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned

not more than six months, or both. A violation of this subsection may be

enjoined at the suit of the Attorney General, United States attorneys, or

other persons duly authorized to represent the United States. "

Upon receipt of complaints regarding violations of this newly

adopted amendment, the field should immediately conduct appropriate

investigation to develop full facts in order that timely presentation may be

made to the appropriate U. S. Attorney in the district where the violation

occurred to determine if the case has prosecutive merit. The character

of such violations will be "False Advertising or Misuse of Name to

Indicate Federal Agency" and the classification will be 43.

CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL INFORMANTS -- Recently a conversation

relating to hoodlum activities between an informant in one city and his contacting

a local hoodlum that she had listened to part of a telephone conversation between

an unknown individual and a Special Agent of the FBI. The operator was

instructed by the hoodlum to continue to be alert for any similar calls. The

telephone call was made by a criminal informant. who used a code name, and

his identity is not known to the underworld.

Instruct all informants to be most discreet and exercise caution in

telephone calls to contacting Agents even in those instances when calls may be

made to an unlisted number. Informants should always use their code names

and avoid making collect calls, as such calls require handling by an operator

who will know or can determine that the location being called is the FBI. All

Agents should, likewise, be cautioned to make certain that they are careful in

their conversations over the telephone, especially, on long distance calls to a

field office.

Security of our informants and of our investigative operations requires

that we be most circumspect in the use of all communications media, particularly

the telephone, which is subject to monitoring by company employees.

RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA - SECURITY MEASURES

The Bureau has learned recently that Communist Party, USA,

members are taking extra security precautions to determine whether or not

any individual has entered their room or tampered with papers and material

left in the room during the absence of such members. It is reasonable

to assume that such precautions prevail in the residences and offices of

Communist Party members and leaders.

This should be brought to the attention of all investigative

personnel in the security field so as to preclude jeopardizing the future

success of the Bureau's activities and operations. Every precaution must

be taken so that during the course of contacting most sensitive sources,

the same physical conditions exist subsequent to the contact as existed

prior thereto.

Advise the Bureau promptly of any pertinent information

RE: TRAINING - SOUND SCHOOL

In accordance with the Bureau's continuing program of insuring

that each field office has adequate technically trained personnel available,

the Bureau desires that you submit the names of all Special Agents in your

field division who are seriously interested in receiving sound school

training. A technical background, such as that gained through formal

education in science, engineering and technical subjects or through

practical experience in telephony, radio communication and electronic

repair, is most desirable, although not absolutely necessary. Lacking

that, an Agent should possess considerable mechanical aptitude and some

proficiency in one or more building trades such as woodworking, carpentry,

masonry, electrical wiring; etc. A factual, detailed statement shoula be

provided as to each Agent's technical background and/or mechanical

aptitude and proficiercy in order to permit a worthwhile evaluation of his

capability.

As you are aware, each Sound-trained Agent is afforded specialized

lock training. The Bureau will continue to afford this training at sound school.

However, some offices may have need for lock-trained Agents over and above

the Agents who will receive lock training at future sound schools. In

addition to furnishing background information on all Agents interested in

sound training, you are to assess the need for sound men in your field division

projected as accurately as possible one year and three years from the date

of this letter. You should likewise assess the projected need for any lock

men needed over and above the number of sound men indicated above.

A reply, marked to the attention of the FBI Laboratory, should be

submitted within forty-five days after the receipt of this letter.

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND

SOURCES - INCOME TAXES

L.

No Number SAC Letter 63-E dated March 27, 1963, contained full

details and instructions for a withholding plan through which it was hoped

security informants could satisfy their Federal income tax obligations

arising from payments made to them for services without jeopardizing

their security. The plan was tried or a limited basis and has proven to be

sourd and effective. As a result, it will be expanded to include all field

divisions effective January 1, 1965. Under the plan, payments to certain

security informants and sources for services rendered will be subject to a

20 per cent withholding tax.

There are four categories of circumstances in which taxes will

not be withheld. Taxes are not to be withheld from payments made (1) to

other than security informants and sources, (2) for reimbursement of

expenses, (3) under SAC authority, or (4) to informants who have been able

to report Bureau income on their Federal tax returns without jeopardizing

their security or without challenge from the Internal Revenue Service.

To place the plan into effect, you should immediately review the

personal situation of each security informant and source. Where circumstances

warrant using the procedure, the matter should be discussed with each informant

or source involved. It should be explained to each that the withholding procedure

to be placed into effect January 1, 1965, is being adopted to afford a secure

method of meeting Federal income tax obligations in regard to money receired

from the FBI for services. The Bureau must be advised by November 1, 1964;

of the identity of each informant to be exempted from this program and the

method to be used by each in reporting his Bureau income.

In operating the plan, you should be alert to streamline the procedures.

For example, instructions call for a check to be drawn for the gross amount of

an authorized payment. After it is cashed, the amount to be withheld for taxes

is deducted and deposited in the special checking account; however, it is not

necessary to make a deposit in connection with each such transaction. If it

would simplify the matter, there would be no objection to making one deposit

at the end of each day for the total amount of money withheld that day from

payments to all informants.

In instances where the procedure is not used for certain

as may be proper and feasible.

(A) ARREST AND ARRAIGNMENT - CONFESSIONS - RIGHT TO COUNSEL -- SAC

Letter 64-40 (E) advised you that effective immediately, and upon the advice of

the Department of Justice, all investigative personnel are to warn arrested subjects

of a right to free counsel. The warning required is more fully stated in referenced

SAC Letter.

The new warning is nut to be given to persons not under arrest and not

charged with the crime, who are being interviewed as suspects only. To tell this

latter type of person that he has a right to free counsel is subject to interpretation

as a threat that he is about to be arrested or charged with a crime since otherwise

he would not be appearing before a judge at all.

Bring these clarifying instructions to the attention of all investigative.

personnel immediately.

While the actual number of submissions declined slightly from the previous

the National adoption rate of 24-26%. The anticipated tangible savings of almost $44, 000

States Attorney to be handled under the Deferred Prosecution System, commonly

known as the Brooklyn Plan, and who is not arrested at any stage of the proceed-

ings against him.:

The Department has advised that its policy is that if a juvenile is

arrested his fingerprints are to be taken, but in any case where the juvenile is

not arrested his fingerprints should not be obtained. Moreover, that "whenever

possible" juveniles who are to be handled under the Brooklyn Plan should not

be arrested. An arrest tends to defeat one of the prime purposes of the Plan,

which is to avoid giving the juvenile the stigma of a criminal record.

You are to be guided by the above instructions. In the cases of

juveniles not arrested, no attempt of any kind should be made to obtain the

fingerprints of the juvenile, either by consent or otherwise.

8/25/64

SAC LETTER NO. 64-43

(D) TESTIMONY OF AGENTS -- A Federal trial judge has criticized severely

a Special Agent of the FBI for having "volunteered" testimony that was irrelevant

to the case being tried, and possibly so prejudicial to one defendant as to

constitute grounds for mistrial.

In response to questions asked upon direct examination, the Agent

testified to relevant statements made to him by a second defendant. At the

conclusion of this testimony, the prosecutor asked, "Then what did

Mr.

say?" After attempting to avoid answering this question, the

Agent was directed by the judge to answer the question first and to offer any

necessary explanation later.

The Agent then testified to an additional remark

made by one defendant which linked another defendant to a separate and

distinct crime of state jurisdiction.

The correct answer to the prosecutor's question asked under the

circumstances is "nothing about this matter," or other words having the

same meaning. Such an answer truthfully admits that something else was

said, but also puts the court on notice that in the judgment of the Agent the

additional remarks have no relevancy to the issues at trial. If the judge doubts

the Agent's judgment as to relevancy, he can dismiss the jury and direct the

Agent to answer the question out of the jury's hearing. If the judge persists

in directing the Agent to answer without dismissing the jury, as might

conceivably occur, the responsibility for bringing improper testimony into

the trial is that of the judge, not the Agent.

Doubts concerning relevancy can best be resolved by conferring

with the prosecutor before trial. In any evert, all investigative personnel

in your office must be advised that whether through conferences with the

prosecutor or exercise of the Agent's own judgment on the stand, it is

expected that testimony will be confined to matters which are relevant.

(E) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY - MEMBERSHIP IN FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY

POSSIBLE CLUB -- As the result of a recent suggestion, a National Academy

Possible Club will be initiated and a medal will be awarded to National Academy

(NA) students and graduates ir good standing who shoot a perfect score on the

Practical Pistol Course (PPC) either on the ranges at Quantico or during

regularly scheduled Bureau firearms sessions in the field under the same

conditions as required of Special Agents.

Names of NA men who shoot perfect scores on a record run of the

PPC will be placed on an FBINA Possible Club Plaque at the FBI Academy

at Quantico. In each case, the Special Agent in Charge must submit a letter

(original and three copies) to the Bureau marked for the attention of the

FBINA Desk in the Training Division. This letter must specifically certify

that the possible was shot during a regularly scheduled firearms session on

a record run over the prescribed distances and within the prescribed time

limits for the PPC. The letter must contain the names of the observer who

witnessed the shooting of the target and the firearms instructor who was in

charge of the firearms session and who must have personally scored the target,

All 50 hits in the K-5 area of the target must be clearly distinguishable.

If there is any question as to the correct score on any target, it should be

forwarded to the Bureau, Attention: Training Division, for final scoring.

A graduate who fired a possible while attending the NA will be

awarded a medal only upon his specific request and subject to verification

by existing Bureau records. The award will not be made retroactive for those

who have fired possibles during a regularly scheduled FBl field office firearms

session but will be placed into effect to include all firearms sessions subsequent

to August 15, 1964.

For. membership in the Possible Club the perfect score

must be fired with either a Bureau-issue-type revolver or a personally owned

revolver with no more than a four-inch barrel.

a statistical compilationcovering work-related injuries sustained in the

field during fiscal year 1964. This report should be compared with the

report furnished to you by SAC Letter 63-40. There was an increase

of 23 injuries during fiscal year 1964. The injury rate throughout the

Bureau for fiscal year 1964 was approximately 3. 72 per cent. If your

office exceeds this average rate of work-related injuries, you must

immediately take any action necessary to reduce the number of work-

related injuries. All employees should be advised of the necessity of

our safety programs and instructed to use every safety precaution in

the performance of their duties.

Organization (SO) of the Communist Party of Panama has listed a number

Although Bureau has no personnel assigned in Panama, all

Panamanian Communist Party or any other foreign subversive group is

attempting to penetrate the FBI or other United States agency. Applicant

investigations involving persons with Panamanian background should be most

(A) THOROUGHNESS OF INVESTIGATIONS -- You are aware that the results

of many phases of our investigations are given extremely wide dissemination

at Seat of Government to all executive branches of the Government including

the White House. The excellence or conversely the lack of excellence of our

reports and memoranda reporting the results of our investigations is the

standard by which we are judged.

I am gravely concerned over the gross derelictions exhibited by

various offices in conducting and reporting investigations of extreme importance

recently. In numerous instances the Bureau has received communications

from recipients of our reports and memoranda which pointed out gaps in our

investigations as well as other defects and shortcomings.

It is your responsibility to insure that our investigations are

thorough, complete, and reported in an incisive manner. Our reports should

be such that at no time will a situation arise where gaps or defects in our

investigations can be called to our attention.

There must be an immediate improvement in this over-all

situation. Any necessity to call the above-mentioned facts to your attention

in the future will result in severe administrative action.

(B) ACCOMPLISHMENTS - PRESENTATION OF CASES TO UNITED STATES

ATTORNEY -- Criminal investigations handled by the FBI are designed to

obtain evidence for prosecution in Federal court and not in state or local

courts. When Agents discuss cases with the U. S. Attorney (USA) or his

assistant, it is expected that such will be done with sufficient aggressiveness

to insure the Bureau's interests are protected.

While it is the prerogative of the USA and his staff to authorize

prosecution, it is stressed that we do not have the manpower to investigate

violations which are later prosecuted in other than Federal courts. During

presentations of cases to USA's, it is expected that the amount of time and

effort expended by Bureau personnel will be mentioned in its proper

perspective. Consideration can then be given to this factor by the USA prior.

to deciding whether he will decline prosecution in favor of handling by local

authorities. You should bear in mind that if a case is investigated by the

FBI and prosecuted in local court additional Agent time and expense may

well be lost if Bureau personnel are called on to testify in state court.

Eitective immediately, Whenever Federal prosecution is declined

by a UsA or his assistant in favor of prosecution by locat authorities, and

investigation has been conducted by Bureau personnel, the Bureau should be

notified immediately by airtel or more expeditious means depending on the

circumstances involved. This communication should contain a concise

summary of the violation, the extent of the investigation conducted by your

office, and the specific reason why the USA feels the matter should be

handled in local court. You should also include your recommendations

as to whether this matter should be taken up with departmental officials

at the headquarters level.

This notification to the Bureau does not apply to cases involving

juveniles or where the USA declines in favor of handling in local court prior

to investigation being conducted by your office.

These instructions do not alter the requirement that the Bureau

be immediately advised when USA's decline prosecution in criminal matters

where military personnel are involved.

The above should be brought to the attention of all investigative

personnel:

Appropriate manual changes follow..

(C) SECURITY INDEX - CHINA - CUBA -- Arrangements have been worked

out with the Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service

(INS) for the special handling of Chinese and Cuban aliens on the Security

Index (SI) in time of a limited emergency. As a result thereof, any infor-

mation received through our sources in connection with our SI responsibilities

indicating a change in residence and/or employment of a Chinese or Cuban

alien on the SI would be of immediate interest to INS on a local level.

INS headquarters and the Department have also expressed a desire to

promptly receive information of this type in addition to that routinely

furnished by reports and letterhead memoranda.

Form FD-366 has been devised and is currently being utilized

in connection with our program to keep Secret Service promptly advised.

of changes of residence and/or employment of SI subjects. In view of the

above, when submitting form FD-366 reporting changes concerning Chinese

and Cuban aliens in the future, furnish one copy to INS as well as Secret

Service locally. Also furnish four copies instead of the normal two copies

to the Bureau for appropriate dissemination at the Seat of Government.

Bear in mind, however, in filling out the reference on the

FD-366 that some memoranda have been expressly prepared for dissemination

to Secret Service only, and have not been furnished to the Department or

INS; therefore, the copy furnished INS locally and two of the copies furnished

the Bureau should reference the last communication to INS.

RE: PREPARATION OF ABSTRACTS IN CONNECTION WITH

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS AND

"JUNE" MATERIAL

Detailed summaries of highly sensitive information set forth

in communications in criminal intelligence investigations are not desirable

on abstracts submitted with these communications. Accordingly, ail

Agents handling criminal intelligence investigations should be cautioned

to avoid inclusion of unnecessary sensitive information on abstracts in

süch matters.

In cases where it is necessary to mark a

communication or

memorandum "June," the body of the accompanying abstract should

contain no reference to any highly confidential techniques, and, further,

the information contained in these abstracts should be carefully

paraphrased so as not to reveal the presence or nature of the technique

utilized. These regulations apply to both the field and the Seat of

Government.

(A) HOUSEHOLD GOODS - COMMUTATION OF EXPENSES FOR

TRANSPORTATION OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND PERSONAL EFFECTS -- The

General Services Administration has prescribed two changes in the commuted

rates for the transportation of household goods and personal effects. The first

change, Circular Number 263, Revision Number 5, applies to shipments

commencing August 25, 1964. The second change, Supplement Number 1,

applies to shipments commencing October 2, 1964. Copies of the changes

are enclosed and additional copies will be forwarded to your office under

separate cover.

All employees of your office who have occasion to submit vouchers

for the transportation and storage of household goods and personal effects

should review the new rates to insure that vouchers are submitted correctly.

Those employees who have previously submitted vouchers for transportation

of household goods which commenced on August 25, 1964, should be advised

that supplemental vouchers should be submitted to reach the Bureau no later

than December 1, 1964.

(B) INTERVIEWS -- Current instructions as set forth in the Manual of

Instructions, (Volume 1, section 2, page 16) and the fBl Handbook (Part L.

page 13a, Item 17) require interviews with witnesses, suspects and subjects;

for the purpose of obtaining information, be conducted wherever possible in

the daytime.

Time of interviews must be arranged with due regard to the rights

of individuals to be free from unnecessary interference or inconvenience.

Where circumstances indicate the availability of an individual for interview

on the following day, the exercise of good judgment would indicate the

undesirability of attempting to interview him at night or in the early morning

hours.

You should insure that the supervisory and investigative staff of your

office are aware of the importance of arranging interviews to avoid any basis

for complaint as to the manner in which the FBI discharges its investigative

responsibilities.

This reiterates instructions contained in SAC Letter 62-25 dated

May 1, 1962.

(C) REPORT WRITING - SUBMISSION OF REPORTS -- Several instances have

been noted during a recent field office inspection where there had been no

submission of reports over an extended period of time in cases wherein thefts

of high value from interstate shipment had occurred.

It is apparent that such cases cannot properly be supervised in

the field or at the Seat of Government without prompt submission of investigative

reports. Effective immediately, investigative reports must be submitted within

45 days in each and every instance where it is determined the loss by theft, fraud,

embezzlement or robbery in those cases over which the Bureau has jurisdiction

amounts to $10, 000 or more. This provision will apply specifically to those

investigative matters handled under the current 90-day reporting rule, such

as in Theft from Interstate Shipment, Theft of Government Property, and Crime

on Government Reservation cases.

Losses by theft or otherwise in these

cases of less than $10, 000 will continue to be reported under the existing 90-

day rule. There will be no change in the existing rule applicable to the

submission of reports in the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property

classification since shortly after these matters initially are opened it is often

determined they do not come within the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau.

The reporting rule applying to other categories of cases, such as Bank Robbery

matters, Civil Rights cases, etc., remains as set forth in the Manual of

Instructions.

I want it clearly understood that these cases must receive

• intelligent and close supervision and such delays as noted above will result

in administrative action being taken.

respectfully request the court or other authority to stay the demand

pending the receipt of instructions or directions from the Attorney

General concerning the demand.

of the Department of Justice by a court or other authority while

he is appearing before, or is otherwise in the presence of the

General, and (2) offer to refer the demand for the prompt con-

sideration of the Attorney General. Unless the court or other

authority withdraws the demand, the United States Attorney, or

to ascertain their interest. Deserter cases were being opened as the result of

inquiries concerning local absent without leave personnel wherein communications

were being submitted to Bureau to determine if AWOL fugitive in possible

deserter status. Of course, there is no objection to a case being opened if

subject is found to be a deserter. ITSMV cases were being opened upon receipt of

stolen car reports from local law enforcement agencies and the submission of

FD-298 forms to Cincinnati for check with Cincinnati Confidential Source 309-C

records as to possible ITSMV violation. At the time of initial contact no

information was received indicating any ITSMV violation. ITSP cases were

opened upon information received from Federal Reserve Banks and forwarded

to other offices concerning checks which were possibly ITSP violations in the

other offices.

In the above situations no actual investigation was conducted

by the office in which the cases were opened. Generally, the cases were being

obtained by one person on a volume basis and opened upon data which might

possibly require investigation. They were subsequently closed administratively

when it proved that no investigation was necessary. The reason stated for

opening these cases was attributed to Part II, Section 3 E, Manual of Rules and

Regulations, which provides that files are to be made up when one or more

interviews are to be conducted. This provision, however, refers to investigative

interviews and not to liaison contacts, receipt of inquiries or records checks

from which information is procured which may or may not require investigation.

This, of course, is to be distinguished from record checks made pursuant to

actual investigative leads from other offices. Cases may be opened on this type

of record check. Information received in the above categories should be more

appropriately handled through control or zero files. The opening of cases in

such matters results in an inflated case load and in addition creates unnecessary

administrative work. I want to make it crystal clear that cases are to be opened

only where one or more interylews of an investigative type are contemplated.

The above instructions are in no way intended to restrict your making

inquiry of all logical sources to obtain cases having prosecutive potential.

(F) DISSEMINATION OF CRIMINAL INFORMATION TO OTHER AGENCIES --

Reference is made to SAC Letter Number 59-30, Section E, which specifically

refers to reporting the total number of items disseminated in this program.

In this connection, it has come to the Bureau's attention in one

instance that items of criminal information disseminated to a number of police

agencies within one division were tabulated as one item for each of the receiving

agencies rather than as a single item of dissemination for the office.

In view of this, it is felt that in order to assure uniformity in the

handling of this phase of the program, the following procedure should be

emphasized at this time:

An item which is circularized or furnished to numerous agencies

should be counted as a single dissemination regardless of the number of agencies

to which furnished. This includes Identification Orders, Apprehension Orders,

Wanted Flyers, Check Circulars, and communications of a similar nature.

• In addition, you are reminded again that this program should be

closely followed in order to insure that all items, including those orally

disseminated to other agencies, are properly recorded on a daily basis and

that all personnel, including those with supervisory responsibilities, are

encouraged to develop the fullest potential of this program.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(C) 'VISIT OF HER MAJESTY QUEEN FREDERIKA OF GREECE TO

UNITED STATES, JANUARY, 1964 -- Her Majesty Queen Frederika of

Greece, her daughter, Princess Irene, and a small entourage are scheduled

to visit the United States between January 21 and February 7, 1964.

Present itinerary indicates she will be in New York City January 21-26,

• 1964, and will be in Washington, D. C., January 26-30, 1964. From

January 31, 1

1964, to February 7, 1964, her itinerary is not firm, but

could include visits to Cape Kennedy, Florida; Boston, Massachusetts, -

and New York. City. She is scheduled to leave the United States on

February 7, 1964, from New York City by ship. Although Her Majesty

will tour the United States in a private capacity, the Department of State

will implement and request security protection and measures that are

normally extended to a foreign head of state.

Department of State is concerned about her safety in view of

the harassing and embarrassing actions taken against her during her two

visits to England in 1963. Reportedly, demonstrations were made by the

militant "Committee of 100" which is demanding the release of certain

political prisoners in Greece. It was indicated these demonstrations were

communist inspired and that similar demunstrations may be attempted

during her visit to the United States. A second point of concern is that

in connection with her contemplated visit to Barnard College, Columbia

University, New York City, on January 22, 1964, there may be organized

efforts to create embarrassing incidents since in October, 1963, an article -

appeared in the Columbia University newspaper alleging that Her Majesty

was a Nazi sympathizer during World War II.

State Department has requested FBI and other appropriate

Government agencies concerned to explore possible existence of any effort

by the Communist Party, USA, communist front organizations or any

dissident groups to create any incidents which could prove dangerous to the

personal safety of Her Majesty or prove embarrassing to her and to the

United States Government. Accordingly, all offices should immediately

contact any informants and sources in a position to furnish information of

this nature and forward to the Bureau in a form suitable for dissemination

any pertinent data so developed.

Informants and sources in a position to acquire such data in the

future should be alerted to the necessity for prompt reporting. Information

concerning threats, violence or hostile demonstrations against Her Majesty,

her entourage or her government should be immediately furnished to the

Bureau, to appropriate local police, to appropriate local office of security,

jurisdiction in such matters, and to highlight to the general public, through

curriculum of the schools may include such topics as The Automobile Theft

Problem (including most recent statistics), FBI Jurisdiction in ITSMV

Cases, Modus Operandi of Auto Thieves, How to Spot a Stolen Car, and

Processing Stolen Cars for Evidence. Also, a representative of the

National Automobile Theft Bureau may be invited to participate in the

schools, to explain how his Bureau may be of assistance. Each field

division has films which are appropriate for use in such schools.

While these specialized schools are not to be solicited, you

should bring them to the attention of law enforcement agencies in your

division. Law enforcement organizations, such as Chiefs and Sheriffs

Associations, may be interested in cooperating in arrangements for a

series of these specialized schools.

(E) ESPIONAGE INVESTIGATIONS -- Espionage violations in which there is

no apparent participation by or with a foreign government can involve misuse,

unauthorized disclosure, theft or photographing of material relating to the

national defense (Title 18, Section 793, 795, 796, 797, 798, United States

Code). These are carried under the Espionage - X character.

In investi-

gating these cases it is imperative that it be borne in mind that the illegal

act may have been committed at the request or behest of a foreign agent

although the person committing the violation was unaware of the foreign

ramification. There are numerous instances in Bureau files in which

an American citizen who was also an agent of a foreign principal requested

another American who was unaware of this foreign connection to obtain

information concerning the national defense either because of friendship

or for financial gain. If the Espionage - X investigation discloses that

an agent of a foreign principal is involved, it could very well mean that

foreign ramifications are present which could increase the importance of

the case as well as the degree of possible damage to the national defense.

You should assure that Espionage - X cases receive thorough and complete

investigative action and that it is resolved during these investigations

- whether there are any foreign ramifications.

1/21/64

SAC LETTER NO. 64-4

(F) INTERNAL SECURITY - NATIONALISTIC TENDENCY - Section 105B,

Manual of Instructions, points out that one of the aims of our investigations

in the Nationalistic Field is to develop information concerning conditions

in foreign countries.

This Section instructs that an effort should be made

to obtain this type of information as it might have a bearing on the current

or future policy of the United States toward such countries or might aid

the intelligence agencies to engage more effectively in counterintelligence

activities. Except in very rare and unusual instances information of this

type is, of course, given wide dissemination by the Bureau immediately

upon its receipt.

A glance at almost any current newspaper will establish the

fact that revolutionary activity is rampant in foreign countries, particularly

in the Caribbean and Latin-American areas. The concern of State Department

and other Government agencies is obvious. Field offices have frequently

received allegations of an apparently significant nature from a confidential

informant or source and in most instances have promptly forwarded such

information to the Bureau. It has been noted, however, that on occasions

1/21/64

SAC LETTER NO. 64-4

NW-55044DocId:32989526 Page 679

---

## Page 680

where time was deemed of the essence as, for example, where an

invasion of a foreign country was allegedly imminent, the Bureau has

been furnished a summary by teletype or by other expeditious means but

the teletype failed to state whether the information should be classified

• 1d/or that details would follow immediately in form suitable for

issemination. In such instances these points should be covered in

the original communication and full details should be expeditiously

forwarded.

Too frequently allegations indicating a critical situation exists

have been received from sources and forwarded to the Bureau without

indicating whether the field is taking any action to corroborate or further

develop the information. The field must recognize that the Government

may go to considerable expense and effort as a result of receiving

one of these allegations and the field must assume the responsibility,

without prodding from the Bureau, of promptly checking these allegations •

out wherever possible.

The original communication to the Bureau or

the cover airtel where letterhead memorandum is used must spell out

just what is being done by the field in this regard.

A large part of our information in these cases comes from

exiled nationals of the countries involved. The field is reminded that

such information may be colored by the individual prejudices and

loyalties of such sources and that, therefore, their information cannot

be accepted at face value. They must be pinned down to actual facts

in their possession. In this connection the Bureau has noted an increasing

laxity on the part of the field in this type of case to properly attribute

information to sources.

Where a source does not possess information

as of his own knowledge the communication must not permit the inference

that this is the case. It should be determined how and from whom the

source obtained his information and, wherever possible, this data should

be included in the memorandum or report prepared for dissemination.

You are instructed to bring the above matters to the attention

of all Agents handling cases in the Nationalistic Tendency Field.

John Edgar Hoover

(D) FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION MATTERS -- Effective

February 1, 1964, the Federal Housing Aaministration (PhA) Is tigntening

ur on certain certifications relative to home improvement loans it insures

i der its Title I program. For example, all borrowers, makers and cosigners

sust henceforth sign the completion certificate and the borrower's authorization

certificate. Application for credit forms have been revised to include an

amplified certificate by the salesman and by any person other than the borrower

who prepares the application. In addition, the completion certificate has been

strengthened by requiring a certification by the dealer that he has paid all his

bills in connection with the work done or that he will do so within sixty days.

FHA has also informed Title I lending institutions that they will be

expected to inspect one out of each ten home improvement jobs performed by

a dealer for at least six months after approving same. Thereafter, spot checks

are to be made as frequently as necessary to assure fidelity of the dealer's

pertormance.

The foregoing new regulations should provide more data as to identity

of persons responsible for preparation of forms and should cause lending

institutions to

. take an active part in processing loans they insure in behalf of

the Government. Since old forms may continue to be used in these cases, you

must be careful to differentiate between the varying language of the certificates

thereon.

These new instructions provide a suitable opportunity for discussion

of FHA Matters with lending institutions, which are usually the first to learn of

indicated violations. Effective liaison with such sources will assist your office

in getting criminal cases more promptly through simultaneous notification of

the FBI as well as FHA in such investigations. Vigorous efforts should be made

to arrange for such prompt referrals. As you have been previously instructed,

all cases in this classification must continue to receive expeditious, vigorous

and imaginative attention.

(A) SURVEILLANCES - RADIO TRANSMISSIONS -- You have been reminded

• peatedly of the possibility that FBI radio transmissions may be heard by un-

uthorized individuals and that FM radio transmissions müst be discreet at all

imes. Standing instructions in this regard are set out in Paragraph 9, Chapter

4, Part II, FBI Handbook, and are reiterated here for emphasis:

"FM radio transmissions must be discreet and names of Agents;

subjects, or specific locations irvolved in Bureau investigative

activities must nct be disclosed. Credential card rumbers should

be used where identity of Agents is necessary in station-to-car

and car-to-station operation. Two-way car call signs should

be used for identification in other operations although coded

names or call signs may be used as necessary in surveillance-

type operations."

+=*+

During a recent sensitive surveillarce in an extremely important

criminal case FBI radio transmissions were monitored by the subject of the

surveillance.. Notes made by the intercepter of these transmissions have been

introduced in court. These notes disclose that in many instances the Agents

did not abide by the above instructions. First names and/or initials of

surveillance Agents were used: the subject of the surveillance was mentioned

by first or last name; and general as well as specific locations of surveillance

cars were reported without any attempt to prevent disclosure. Uncalled for

and unnecessary remarks, among other things, also were recorded by the

subject of the surveillance. Needless to say, this interception and dirulgence

of our radio communications has resulted in considerable embarrassment.

It is desired that this situation be brought to the attention of all

personnel and the instructions as set cut above reiterated. In addition, you

are to personally examine the manner in which your FM radio facilities are

being utilized to insure that the operation of such facilities is in strict

accordance with existing Bureau instructions.

days

Then only the pay for the portion of the absence in excess of thirty

calendar days can be excluded. The maximum allowable exclusion is still

$100 per week. Pay for any period of absence due to illness which began

prior to January 1, 1964, can still be excluded under the former regulations,

regardless of its duration Form FD-307, Application for Sick Leave

Statement, has been revised. Enclosed are three copies of such form,

one copy of which should be placed in the FBI Form Book. All employees

of your office should be advised of this change in regulations.

You should assure that employees having excludable sick pay for

employees who were not enrolled on 3-17-64 to enroll in a health benefit plan

and employees who on 3-17-64 were enrolled for self only to change to a

family enrollment in the same plan or option. The effective date of enrollments

or changes in enrollment due to this limited opportunity registration period

will be the first day of the pay period following the pay period the Health

Benefits Registration Form (SF 2809) is received. On these registrations

"P L." should be placed under "Remarks" of the SF 2809.

The following changes in the Federal Employees Health Benefits

Act were made possible by Public Law 88-254 which was approved on 3-17-64.

Effective 3-17-64 unmarried children up to age 2i (instead of age 19) and

foster children are included under an employee's family enrollment in the

50044 D0070: 32989526

## Page 687

Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). To be considered

a foster child, the child must be living with the employee in a parent-child

relationship and the employee must intend to rear the child indefinitely

into adulthood as if he were his own. Coverage is automatic and all plans

i#ll nonor claims for medical care received on or after 3-17-04.

Employees

who are enrolled in a group-practice or individual-practice plan should

write the plan giving the name and date of birth of any eligible foster child

and any child aged 19 to 21. Employees enrolled in any other plan need

take no action unless their plan requests this information.

Effective 6-21-64 the family-female with nondependent husband-

enrollment will be dropped and female employees will be eligible to enroll

in the regular family plan and will receive the same Government contribution

• ($3. 12 per pay period) as male employees enrolled in the family plan. It

will not be necessary for a female employee enrolled in the family plan to

execute an SF 2809 to change her enrollment code number, The adjustment

will be automatic and will first appear in the pay check dated 7-17-64,

Under separate cover you will be sent notices concerning these changes

to be attached to the SE 2809A's.

Employees aged 19 to 21, who enrolled for self only because upon

attainment of age 19 they lost coverage under a parent's family enrollment

under the FEHBP, should immediately execute an SE 2809 to cancel their

enrollment because they are now covered under a parent's family enrollment

until age 21. Before cancelling his enrollment the employee should ensure

that his parent is still enrolled in a plan under the FEHBP. Upon attainment

of age 21 these employees will again be eligible to enroll for self only since

they will lose their coverage under the parent's enrollment in the FEHBP.

The employees will not be notified when they or a member of their family loses

coverage.

It is the employees' responsibility to follow and make any changes

which would affect their enrollment. Appropriate arrangements are being

made by the SAMBA Office concerning employees with children aged 19 to 21

enrolled in the SAMBA Student Health Benefit Plan and who are affected by

these changes.

An employee enrolled in a plan under the FEHBP who purchased

a conversion contract for a child who is not yet 21 should get in touch with

his plan to cancel the conversion contract. The child will have a new

conversion right when he reaches age 21 or his coverage as a family member

terminates by marriage.

(C) REPORT WRITING -- A recent Federal decision underscores the wisdom

of the Bureau's long-standing policy that information favorable to the defense

must be reported as completely and accurately as that favorable to the

prosecution.

In U. S. ex rel. Meers v. Wilkins, 326 F. 2d 135 (1964), the

Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, held that suppression by the

prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused violates due process of law.

and requires reversal of the conviction. In this case, two witnesses to a

robbery saw the defendant in police custody after arrest and "positively

stated to the police" that the defendant was not the robber. These witnesses

were not called by the prosecution and did not appear at trial. Two other

witnesses positively identified the defendant. Convicted, the defendant

moved for a new trial, submitting an affidavit of assigned counsel that counsel

did not learn of the existence of the two uncalled witnesses until after trial

had ended. After defendant exhausted his state remedies without relief, he

brought habeas corpus in Federal district court where it was held that the

prosecution had a duty to disclose the existence of the two witnesses favorable

to the defense, and that failure to do so violated due process of law. The

Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.

Although Wilkins was a state case, the result would have been the

Same had it been a Federal case. The due process clause in the Fifth

Amendment, applicable to Federal officers, and that in the Fourteenth

Amendment, applicable to state officers, are of identical meaning.

## Page 689

The rule announced in Wilkins springs from Supreme Court

decisions holding that due process is violated by (1) conviction obtained

through use of knowingly false and perjured testimony, Mooney v. Holohan,

294 U. S. 103 (1935), (2) failure to correct unsolicited false testimony for

the prosecution-after-discovery-of-its. falsity, Napue.v. Illinois, 360 U.S.

264 (1959), and (3) suppression of evidence favorable to the accused upon

request of the accused for that evidence, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S.

83 (1963).

The Wilkins decision places upon the U. S. Attorney an affirmative

duty to disclose to the defense at least the existence of potential witnesses

and other evidence for the defense that are known to him. He cannot perform

that duty, however, unless the reports are so complete and accurate that

he is able to identify such witnesses and evidence therein.

The significance of Wilkins for this Bureau is that reports in all

cases must be so complete that they will serve to identify potential witnesses

for the defense, state their observations with sufficient precision to make

the position which they take clear to the U. S. Attorney, and similarly

identify any other evidence for the defense encountered during the investigation.

This includes, as held in Brady, evidence which is "material either to guilt or

to punishment. "

Statements of witnesses in any way favorable to the defense must

be reported on form FD-302 just as are those of witnesses for the prosecution.

It may be held that the defense can call for those statements. 34 Federal Rules

Decisions 88 (1964).

The reporting must be as clear and as free from equivocation or

ambiguity as the information encountered by the Agent will permit. For

example, if a witness to a bank robbery sees the defendant after arrest and

states that the defendant is not the robber, a report that the witness "failed

to identify" the robber would be defective; the quoted words would not

correctly show the position taken by the witness and hence would not put

the U. S. Attorney on notice that the witness is potentially one for the defense.

The cited decisions and these instructions are not to be interpreted

as requiring the government to make an investigation for the defense. They

go no further (for FBI purposes) than to require that if, while making the

usual and proper investigation for the government, we come upon evidence:

NW 55044 DogId:32289526 Page 689

## Page 690

of any kind seemingly favorable to the defendant, we must report the

existence and nature of that evidence accurately and completely. This has

long been the FBI rule, but current developments suggest that it should

be reiterated.

These instructions must be brought to the attention of all

nvestigative personnel immediately.

(D) LAW ENFORCEMENT CONFERENCES, 1964 - "THE FLEEING

FELON" -- Law Enforcement Conferences in 1964 will concern fugitive

investigations; they will be called "The Fleeing Felon"' conferences.

Subject matter will encompass assistance FBI can render to local law

enforcement under the Fugitive Felon Act and through other cooperative •

functions, and principles involved in fugitive investigations. Schedule

sufficient conferences to cover your territory adequately; wherever

possible; utilize sites that are readily accessible to local law enforcement

and others invited to your conferences. Conferences should be held

between September 15 and November 1, 1964; adjoining offices should be

advised of your conference plans; border offices may invite nearby

Canadian and Mexican police officials. Conference agenda should be

limited to four to six hours; should be of the open-forum type, with

necessary talks restricted to 15 minutes; audience participation should

be encouraged. Qualified speakers from local law enforcement, prosecutors,

and related fields, may be used as panelists; names of contemplated panelists

should be checked through your indices and the Bureau advised of the resuits.

Attendance of undesirables should be avoided, and representatives of

commercial concerns should not be invited.

You are authorized to prepare friendly but businesslike circular

letters of invitation to be sent to police officials, sheriffs' departments,

penal institutions, state correctional agencies, local and state prosecutors,

and others in related fields who might refer unlawful flight matters to the

Bureau.

You may desire to utilize police instructors in the planning of

interesting and informative programs; however, you should preside at each

conference personally. Potential curricula topics are:

(E) CASES CLOSED UPON AUTHORITY OF SAC - REPORT WRITING -- I

wish to re-emphasize my concern over premature closing of unsolved cases.

I order to insure the Bureau has fulfilled its responsibilities under the law,

ris imperative that every step be taken to make certain that existing

instructions are fully complied with.

It was necessary to require that no unsolved bank robbery cases

be closed upon authority of the Special Agent in Charge (SAC), and if

present regulations are not strictly adhered to it will become necessary

to remove all authority to close cases by the SAC. The importance of

this matter should be clearly understood by all employees. As you are

aware, the closing of cases upon SAC authority will be checked into

in connection with inspections and any derelictions will be subject to

appropriate administrative action.

(D) SEARCHES AND SEIZURES -- Two unanimous search and seizure

decisions handed down by the Supreme Court on March 23, 1964, must

be brought to the attention of all investigative personnel.

Both are

important and one makes a significant change in the law.

In Stoner v. California, police officers entered the subject's

hotel room, by consent of the night clerk; after being advised by the clerk

that the subject was out of the room as shown by his room key being in

the mailbox. The officers searched the room and took several articles

which were used as evidence at trial. The subject was arrested in

another state two days later.

The conviction was reversed on the ground that the evidence

taken from the hotel room was obtained by a search and seizure which

was unreasonable because it was based on consent of the hotel clerk

rather than consent of the subject.

"No less than a tenant of a house,

or the occupant of a room in a boarding house, a guest in a hotel room

is entitled to constitutional protection against unreasonable searches

and seizures." The tenant has the possessory right in the room which

he has rented, and that right is one "which only the petitioner (subject)

could waive by word or deed, either directly or through an agent."

There was in this case, as in most, no evidence to indicate that the

tenant had authorized the clerk to consent to a search of the tenant's

room.

The Stoner decision only reiterates the prevailing rule on

this point.

In Preston v. U. S., four police officers of a small city arrested

three men in a parked car at 3:00 a.m. on vagrancy charges. The car was

not searched at the time of arrest. It was driven by an officer to the station,

from which it was towed to a garage. Soon after the subjects were booked

at the station, some of the police officers went to the garage to search

the car and found two loaded revolvers in the glove compartment. They

were unable to open the trunk and returned to the station, where a detective

told one of the officers to go back and try to get into the trunk. The officer

did so, was able to enter the trunk through the back seat of the car, and

in the trunk found various items adapted to the perpetration of a robbery.

After the searches, one of the men confessed that he and two others intended

to rob a bank nearby. At this point Bureau Agents were called in and

the materials found in the car were turned over to them. It was contended

by the defense that the use of these materials at trial violated the Fourth

Amendment.

The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, stating that the

"search of the car was unreasonable and the evidence ebtained thereby was

inadmissible. The search of the car was unreasonable because it was

made at a time and place different from that of the arrest and thus was

"simply not incident to the arrest." Search of a vehicle or fixed premises

incidental to arrest therein must be made contemporaneously with the arrest -

following the arrest and at the same place. Searches of such places inci-

dental to arrest are an exception to the basic rule that all such searches

must be made by search warrant. Once the car in this case had been taken

to the garage under police custody, the subjects could no longer use any

weapons therein to attack the officers, nor destroy the evidence therein,

nor hide the car from the police. The reason for granting an exception to

the basic rule requiring searches by search warrant had disappeared.

The Government's brief before the Supreme Court in this case

cited three earlier Federal decisions allowing search of a vehicle, inci-

dental to arrest, at a time and place different from that of arrest where

neither the time nor the distance was great. These decisions, although

not mentioned in the opinion, must be taken as overruled.

An alternative method of searching the vehicle in situations like

this is by consent.

Consent searches, however, are only another exception

to the basic rule that searches must be made by search warrant. The

genuinely voluntary consent necessary to sustain a consent search often is

difficult to prove, and particularly so in the case of a person under arrest

and denying guilt.

The rehicle searched here was owned by one of the subjects

and lawfully occupied by all three. This was not a stolen-car-case.-A-

thief or other trespasser, having no legal right to occupy the vehicle or

other place searched, has no rights which can be violated by search of the

vehicle or place. It will be assumed that this rule continues for stolen

vehicle cases since the court did not decide that issue in this case.

(F) FALSE ADVERTISING OR MISUSE OF NAME TO INDICATE FEDERAL

AGENCY -- Section 19 of the Peace Corps Act was amended by the 88th

Congress and approred by the President on December 13, 1963. The

provisions of the amendment are set forth as follows:

-Section 19 of the Peace Corps-Act,as amended, which relates

to the Peace Corps seal, is amended by striking out the short title and

substituting therefor "Exclusive Right to Seal and Name"', by inserting

"(a)" before "The President may," and by adding a new subsection as

follows:

"(1b) (1) -The use of the official seal or emblem and the use

of the name 'Peace Corps' shall be restricted exclusively to designate

programs authorized under this Act.

"(2) Whoever, whether an individual, partnership, corporation,

or association; uses the seal for which provision is made in this section,

or any sign, insignia, or symbol in colorable imitation thereof, or the

words 'Peace Corps' or any combination of these or other words or

characters in colorable imitation,thereof other than to designate programs

authorized under this Act, shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned

not more than six months, or both. A violation of this subsection may be

enjoined at the suit of the Attorney General, United States attorneys, or

other persons duly authorized to represent the United States. "

Upon receipt of complaints regarding violations of this newly

adopted amendment, the field should immediately conduct appropriate

investigation to develop full facts in order that timely presentation may be

made to the appropriate U. S. Attorney in the district where the violation

occurred to determine if the case has prosecutive merit. The character

of such violations will be "False Advertising or Misuse of Name to

Indicate Federal Agency" and the classification will be 43.

(B) SECURITY OF TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS - SECURITY INFORMANTS -

CRININAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL INFORMANTS -- Recently a conversation

relating to hoodlum activities between an informant in one city and his contacting •

Agent in another city was overheard by a telephone operator, who reported to

a local hoodlum that she had listened to part of a telephone conversation between

an unknown individual and a Special Agent of the FBI. The operator was

instructed by the hoodlum to continue to be alert for any similar calls. The

telephone call was made by a criminal informant, who used a code name, and

his identity is not known to the underworld.

Instruct all informants to be most discreet and exercise caution in

telephone calls to contacting Agents even in those instances when calls may be

made to an unlisted number. Informants should always use their code names

and avoid making collect calls, as such calls require handling by an operator

who will know or can determine that the location being called is the FBI. All

Agents should, likewise, be cautioned to make certain that they are careful in

their conversations over the telephone, especially, on long distance calls to a

field office.

RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA - SECURITY MEASURES

The Bureau has learned recently that Communist Party, USA,

members are taking extra security precautions to determine whether or not

any individual has entered their room or tampered with papers and material

left in the room during the absence of such members. It is reasonable

to assume that such precautions prevail in the residences and offices of

Communist Party members and leaders.

This should be brought to the attention of all investigative

personnel in the security field so as to preclude jeopardizing the future

success of the Bureau's activities and operations. Every precaution must

be taken so that during the course of contacting most sensitive sources,

the same physical conditions exist subsequent to the contact as existed

prior thereto.

Advise the Bureau promptly of any pertinent information

received which relates to this matter.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

RE: TRAINING - SOUND SCHOOL

In accordance with the Bureau's continuing program of insuring

t' it each field office has adequate technically trained personnel available,

' ‹e Bureau desires that you submit the names of all Special Agents in your

ield division who are seriously interested in receiving sound school

raining. A technical background, such as that gained through formal

ducation in science, engineering and technical subjects or through

practical experience in telephony, radio communication and electronic

repair, is most desirable, although not absolutely necessary. Lacking

that, an Agent should possess considerable mechanical aptitude and some

proficiency in one or more building trades such as woodworking, carpentry,

masonry, electrical wiring, etc. A factual, detailed statement should be

provided as to each Agent's technical background and/or mechanical

aptitude and proficiency in order to permit a worthwhile evaluation of his

capavility.

As you are aware, each Sound-trained Agent is afforded specialized

lock training.

The Bureau will continue to afford this training at sound school.

However, some offices may have need for lock-trained Agents over and above

the Agents who will receive lock training at future sound schools. In

addition to furnishing background information on all Agents interested in

sound training; you are to assess the need for sound men in your field division

projected as accurately as possible one year and three years from the date

of this letter. You should likewise assess the projected need for any lock

• men needed over and above the number of sound men indicated above.

A reply, marked to the attention of the FBI Laboratory, should be

submitted within forty-five days after the receipt of this letter.

Very truly yours,

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND

SOURCES - INCOME TAXES

No Number SAC Letter 63-E dated March 27, 1963, contained full

details and instructions for a withholding plan through which it was hoped

security informants could satisfy their Federal income tax obligations

arising from payments made to them for services without jeopardizing

their security. The plan was tried or a limited basis and has proven to be

sourd and effective. As a result, it will be expanded to include all field

divisions effective January 1, 1965. Under the plan, payments to certain

security informants and sources for services rendered will be subject to a

20 per cent withholding tax.

There are four categories of circumstarces in which taxes will

not be withheld. Taxes are not to be withheld from payments made (1) to

-03550n a.

other than security infermants and sources, (2) for reimbursement of

expenses, (3) under SAC authority, or (4) to informants who have been able

to report Bureau income on their Federal tax returns without jeopardizing •

their security or without challenge from the Internal Revenue Service.

To place the plan into effect, you should immediately review the

personal situation of each security informant and source. Where circumstances

warrant using the procedure, the matter should be discussed with each informant

or source involved. It should be explained to each that the withholding procedure

to be placed into effect. January 1, 1965, is being adopted to afford a secure

method of meeting Federal income tax obligations in regard to money receired

from the FBI for services. The Bureau must be advised by November 1, 1964,

of the identity of each informant to be exempted from this program and the

method to be used by each in reporting his Bureau income.

In operating the plan, you should be alert to streamline the procedures..

For example, instructions call for a check to be drawn for the gross amount of

an authorized payment. After it is cashed, the amount to be withheld for taxes

is deducted and deposited in the special checking accourt; however, it is not

necessary to make a deposit in connection with each such transaction. If it

would simplify the matter, there would be no objection to making one deposit

at the end of each day for the total amount of money withheld that day from

payments to all informants.

DocId: 32989526 Page 705

## Page 706

In instances where the procedure is not used for certain

informants or sources, you should continue to instruct them to satisfy

heir tax obligations on income received from the FBI by such methods

as may be proper and feasible.

ings against him.

The Department has advised that its policy is that if a juvenile is

arrested his fingerprints are to be taken, but in any case where the juvenile is

not arrested his fingerprints should not be obtained. Moreover, that "'whenever-.

possible" juveniles who are to be handled under the Brooklyn Plan should not

be arrested. An arrest tends to defeat one of the prime purposes of the Plan,

which is to avoid giving the juvenile the stigma of a criminal record.

You are to be guided by the above instructions. In the cases of

juveniles not arrested, no attempt of any kind should be made to obtain the

fingerprints of the juvenile, either by consent or otherwise.

(D) TESTIMONY OF AGENTS" ^ Federal trial judge has criticized severely

a Special Agent of the FBI for having "volunteered" testimony that was irrelevant

to the case being tried, and possibly so prejudicial to one defendant as to

constitute grounds for mistrial.

In response to questions asked upon direct examination, the Agent

testified. to relevant statements made to him by a second defendant. At the

'conclusion of this testimony, the prosecutor asked, "Then what did

Mr.

say?" After attempting to avoid answering this question, the

Agent was directed by the judge to answer the question first and to offer any

necessary explanation later. The Agent then testified to an additional remark

made by one defendant which linked another defendant to a separate and

distinct crime of state jurisdiction.

The correct answer to the prosecutor's question asked under the

circumstances is "nothing about this matter," or other words having the

same meaning. Such an answer truthfully admits that something else was

said, but also puts the court on notice that in the judgment of the Agent the

additional remarks have no relevancy to the issues at trial: If the judge doubts

the Agent's judgment as to relevancy, he can dismiss the jury and direct the

Agent to answer the question out of the jury's hearing. If the judge persists

in directing the Agent to answer without dismissing the jury, as might

conceivably occur, the responsibility for bringing improper testimony into

the trial is that of the judge, not the Agent.

(A) THOROUGHNESS OF INVESTIGATIONS -- You are aware that the results

of many phases of our investigations are given extremely wide dissemination

at Seat of Government to all executive branches of the Government including

t' White House. The excellence or conversely the lack of excellence.of our

' sports and memoranda reporting the results of our investigations is the

tandard by which we are judged.

I am gravely concerned over the gross derelictions exhibited by

various offices in conducting and reporting investigations of extreme importance

recently. In numerous instances the Bureau has received communications

from recipients of our reports and memoranda which pointed out gaps in our

investigations as well as other defects and shortcomings.

It is your responsibility to insure that our investigations are

thorough, complete, and reported in an incisive manner. Our reports should

be such that at no time will a situation arise where gaps or defects in our

investigations can be called to our attention.

There must be an immediate improvement in this over-all

situation. Any necessity to call the above-mentioned facts to your attention -

in the future will result in severe administrative action.

(B) ACCOMPLISHMENTS - PRESENTATION OF CASES TO UNITED STATES

ATTORNEY -- Criminal investigations handled by the FBI are designed to

•obtain evidence for prosecution in Federal court and not in state or local

courts. When Agents discuss cases with the U. S. Attorney (USA) or his

assistant, it is expected that such will be done with sufficient aggressiveness

to insure the Bureau's interests are protected.

While it is the prerogative of the USA and his staff to authorize

prosecution, it is stressed that we do not have the manpower to investigate

violations which are later prosecuted in other than Federal courts. During

presentations of cases to USA's, it is expected that the amount of time and

effort expended by Bureau personnel will be mentioned in its proper

perspective. Consideration can then be given to this factor by the USA prior

to deciding whether he will decline prosecution in favor of handling by local

authorities. You should bear in mind that if a case is investigated by the

FBI and prosecuted in local court additional Agent time and expense may

well be lost if Bureau personnel are called on to testify in state court.

alána no anterpoto a d0o1 =

Effective immediately, whenever Federal prosecution is declined

by a USA or his assistant in favor of prosecution by local authorities, and

investigation has been conducted by Bureau personnel, the Bureau should be

notified immediately by airtel or more expeditious means depending on the

circumstances involved. This communication should contain a concise

summary of the violation, the extent of the investigation conducted by your

office, and the specific reason why the USA feels the matter should be

handled in local court. You should also include your recommendations

as to whether this matter should be taken up with departmental officials

at the headquarters level.

This notification to the Bureau does not apply to cases involving

juveniles or where the USA declines in favor of handling in local court prior

to investigation being conducted by your office.

These instructions do not alter the requirement that the Bureau

be immediately advised when USA's decline prosecution in criminal matters

where military personnel are involved.

The above should be brought to the attention of all investigative

personnel:

Appropriate manual changes follow..

(C) SECURITY INDEX - CHINA - CUBA -- Arrangements have been worked

out with the Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service

(INS) for the special handling of Chinese and Cuban aliens on the Security

Index (SI) in time of a limited emergency. As a result thereof, any infor-

mation received through our sources in connection with our SI responsibilities

indicating a change in residence and/or employment of a Chinese or Cuban

alien on the SI would be of immediate interest to INS on a local level.

INS headquarters and the Department have also expressed a desire to

promptly receive information of this type in addition to that routinely

furnished by reports and letterhead memoranda.

Form FD-366 has been devised and is currently being utilized

in connection with our program to keep Secret Service promptly advised.

of changes of residence and/or employment of SI subjects. In view of the

above, when submitting form FD-366 reporting changes concerning Chinese

and Cuban aliens in the future, furnish one copy to INS as well as Secret

Service locally. Also furnish four copies instead of the normal tvo copies

to the Bureau for appropriate dissemination at the Seat of Government.

.....

Bear in mind, however, in filling out the reference on tho

FD-366 that some memoranda have been expressly prepared for dissemination

to Secret Service only, and have not been furnished to the Department or

INS; therefore, the copy furnished INS locally and two of the copies furnished

the Bureau should reference the last communication to INS.

RE: PREPARATION OF ABSTRACTS IN CONNECTION WITH

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS AND

"JUNE" MATERIAL

Detailed summaries of highly sensitive information set forth

in communications in criminal intelligence investigations are not desirable

on abstracts submitted with these communications. Accordingly, all

Agents handling criminal intelligence investigations should be cautioned

to avoid inclusion of unnecessary sensitive information on abstracts in

Such matters.

In cases where it is necessary to mark a communication or

memorandum "June," the body of the accompanying abstract should

contain no reference to any highly confidential techniques, and, further,

the information contained in these abstracts should be carefully

paraphrased so as not to reveal the presence or nature of the technique

utilized. These regulations apply to both the field and the Seat of

Government.

Very truly yours,

(A) HOUSEHOLD GOODS - COMMUTATION OF EXPENSES FOR

TRANSPORTATION OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND PERSONAL EFFECTS -- The

General Services Administration has prescribed two changes in the commuted

rates for the transportation of household goods and personal effects. The first

change, Circular Number 263: Revision Number 5, applies to shipments

commencing August 25, 1964. The second-change,-Supplement Number 1,-

applies to shipments commencing October 2, 1964. Copies of the changes

are enclosed and additional copies will be forwarded to your office under

separate cover.

All employees of your office who have occasion to submit vouchers

for the transportation and storage of household goods and personal effects

should review the new rates to insure that vouchers are submitted correctly,

Those employees who have previously submitted vouchers for transportation

of household goods which commenced on August 25, 1964, should be advised

that supplemental vouchers should be submitted to reach the Bureau no later

than December 1, 1964.

(B) INTERVIEWS -- Current instructions as set forth in the Manual of

Instructions, (Volume 1, Section 2, page 16) and the FBI Handbook (Part II.

page 13a, Item 17) require interviews with witnesses, suspects and subjects:

for the purpose of obtaining information, be conducted wherever possible in

the daytime.

• ....

Time of interviews must be arranged with due regard to the rights

of individuals to be free from unnecessary interference or inconvenience.

Where circumstances indicate the availability of an individual for interview

on the following day, the exercise of good judgment would indicate the

undesirability of attempting to interview him at night of in the early morning

hours.

You should insure that the supervisory and investigative staff of your

office are aware of the importance of arranging interviews to avoid any basis

for complaint as to the manner in which the FBI discharges its investigative

responsibilities.

This reiterates instructions contained in SAC Letter 62-25 dated

May 1, 1962.

(C) REPORT WRITING - SUBMISSION OF REPORTS - Several instances have

been noted during a recent field office inspection where there had been no

submission of reports over an extended period of time in cases wherein thefts

of high value from interstate shipment had occurred.

It is apparent that such cases cannot properly be supervised in —

the field or at the Seat of Government without prompt submission of investigative

reports. Effective immediately, investigative reports must be submitted within

45 days in each and every instance where it is determined the loss by theft, fraud,

embezzlement or robbery in those cases over which the Bureau has jurisdiction

amounts to $10, 000 or more. This provision will apply specifically to those

investigative matters handled under the current 90-day reporting rule, such

as in Theft from Interstate Shipment, Theft of Government Property, and Crime

on Government Reservation cases.

Losses by theft or otherwise in these

cases of less than $10, 000 will continue to be reported under the existing 90- .

day rule. There will be no change in the existing rule applicable to the

submission of reports in the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property

classification since shortly after these matters initiallv are opened it is often

determined they do not come within the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau.

The reporting rule applying to other categories of cases, such as Bank Robbery

matters, Civil Rights cases, etc., remains as set forth in the Manual of

Instructions. -

I want it clearly understood that these cases must receive

intelligent and close supervision and such delays as noted above will result

in administrative action being taken.

(D) DEPARTMENTAL ORDER 324-64 - COURT TESTIMONY - DISCLOSURE

OF INFORMATION OR MATERIAL IN RESPONSE TO SUBPOENA, ORDER

OR OTHER DEMAND -- Investigative personnel have long been familiar with

Departmental Order 3229, superseded by 260-62, both of which prohibited

employees of the Department of Justice from disclosing information or material

in the files of the Department of Justice without permission of the Attorney

General. Order 260-62 has now been superseded, effective October 10, 1964,

on publication in the Federal Register that day, by Departmental Order 324-64.

The purpose of the new Order is to broaden the prohibition to cover not only

information and material in files but, also, any other information or material

acquired by the employee as a part of the performance of his official duties

or because of his official status. The new Order reads as follows:

"Sec.

"16.1 Production or disclosure of official information or

material in response to a subpoena, order, or other :

demand prohibited unless approved by the Attorney

General.

"16. 2 Procedure in the event of a demand for production

or disclosure.

"16.3 Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

"16.1 Production or disclosure of official information or

material in response to a subpoena, order, or other demand pro-

hibited unless approved by the Attorney General.

"No officer or employee of the Department of Justice shall

produce or disclose, in response to a subpoena, order, or other demand

(hereinafter in this Part referred to as a 'demand') of a court or other

authority any information or material contained in the files of the Depart-

ment of Justice or any other information or material acquired as a part

of the performance of his official duties or because of his official status,

without the prior approval of the Attorney General. For the purposes of

this Part, the term 'officer or employee of the Department of Justice'

includes all officers and employees of the United States appointed by, or

subject to the supervision, jurisdiction, or control of, the Attorney

General of the United States, including United States Attorneys, United

States Marshals, and members of the staffs of those officials.

"16.2 Procedure in the event of a demand for production or

production or disclosure of any other intormation or material acquired

as a part of the performance of his official duties or because of his

official status, he shall immediately notify the Attorney General of

such demand. If possible, the Attorney General shall be notified before

the officer or employee concerned replies to, or appears before, the

court or other authority.

"(2) The appropriate United States Attorney, or such other

attorney as may be designated for the purpose, shall appear with the

officer or employee upon whom the demand shall have been made, and

inform the court or other authority (A) that s 16.1 of this Part

prohibits the officer or employee from producing or disclosing

the information or material demanded without the prior approval

of the Attorney General, and (B) that the demand has been, or is

being, as the case may be, referred for the prompt consideration

of the Attorney General. The United States Attorney, or the

attorney designatea, shall provide the court of other authority

with a copy of the regulations prescribed in this Part and shall

respectfully request the court or other authority to stay the demand

pending the receipt of instructions or directions from the Attorney

General concerning the demand.

"(b) Whenever a demand of the type described in

paragraph (a) of this section is made upon an officer or employee

of the Department of Justice by a court or other authority while.

he is appearing before, or is otherwise in the presence of the

court or other authority, the officer or employee, or the United

States Attorney or other appropriate Government attorney, acting

on behalf of the officer or employee, shall (1) immediately inform

the court or other authority that § 16. 1 of this Part prohibits the

officer or employee from producing or disclosing the information

or material demanded without the prior approval of the Attorney

General, and (2) offer to refer the demand for the prompt con-

sideration of the Attorney General. Unless the court or other

authority withdraws the demand, the United States Attorney, or

other appropriate Government attorney, shall provide the court

or other authority with a copy of the regulations prescribed by

this Part and shall respectfully request the court or other authority

to stay the demand pending the receipt of instructions or directions

from the Attorney General concerning the demand.

(E) OPENING OF CASES -- During recent inspections it has been found

necessary to instruct offices to close a number of cases which had been

improperly opened, primarily in Bureau applicant, deserter, interstate

transportation of stolen motor vehicle (ITSMV) and interstate transportation

of stolen property (ITSP) matters. Inspectors have determined that Bureau

applicant cases were being opened on persons of unknown qualifications who might

be possibly interested in employment with the Bureau and were being contacted

10/27/64

SAC LETTER NO. 64-52

55044 DocId: 32989526

## Page 744

to ascertain their interest. Deserter cases were being opened as the result of

inquiries concerning local absent without leave personnel wherein communications

were being submitted to Bureau to determine if AWOL fugitive in possible

deserter status. Of course, there is no objection to a case being opened if

subject is found to be a deserter. ITSMV cases were being opened upon receipt of

stolen car reports from local law enforcement agencies and the submission of

FD-298 forms to Cincinnati for check with Cincinnati Confidential Source 309-C

records as to possible ITSMV violation. At the time of initial contact no

information was received indicating any ITSMV violation. ITSP cases were

opened upon information received from Federal Reserve Banks and forwarded

to other offices concerning checks which were possibly ITSP violations in the

other offices.

In the above situations no actual investigation was conducted

by the office in which the cases were opened. Generally, the cases were being

obtained by one person on a volume basis and opened upon data which might

possibly require investigation. They were subsequently closed administratively

when it proved that no investigation was necessary. The reason stated for

opening these cases was attributed to Part II, Section 3 E, Manual of Rules and

Regulations, which provides that files are to be made up when one or more

interviews are to be conducted. This provision, however, refers to investigative

interviews and not to liaison contacts, receipt of inquiries or records checks.

from which information is procured which may or may not require investigation.

This, of course, is to be distinguished from record checks made pursuant to

actual investigative leads from other offices. Cases may be opened on this type

of record check. Information received in the above categories should be more

appropriately handled through control or zero files. The opening of cases in

such matters results in an inflated case load and in addition creates unnecessary

administrative work. I want to make it crystal clear that cases are to be opened

only where one or more interviews of an investigative type are contemplated.

The above instructions are in no way intended to restrict your making

inquiry of all logical sources to obtain cases having prosecutive potential.

(F) DISSEMINATION OF CRIMINAL INFORMATION TO OTHER AGENCIES --

Reference is made to SAC Letter Number 59-30, Section E, which specifically

refers to reporting the total number of items disseminated in this program.

-In-this-connection,-it has come to the Bureau's attention in one_

instance that items of criminal information disseminated to a number of police

agencies within one division were tabulated as one item for each of the receiving

agencies rather than as a single item of dissemination for the office.

In view of this, it is felt that in order to assure uniformity in the

handling of this phase of the program, the following procedure shoula be

emphasized at this time:

An item which is circularized or furnished to numerous agencies

should be counted as a single dissemination regardless of the number of agencies

to which furnished. This includes Identification Orders, Apprehension Orders,

Wanted-Flyers, Check Circulars, and communications of a similar nature.

• In addition, you are reminded again that this program should be

closely followed in order to insure that all items, including those orally

disseminated to other agencies, are properly recorded on a daily basis and—

that all personnel, including those with supervisory responsibilities, are

encouraged to develop the fullest potential of this program.

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES -

• INCOME TAXES

No Number SAC Letter 64-E dated July 6, 1964, advised that

rilectire January 1, 1965, all field divisions must utilize the Bureau

foderal income tax withholding plan for payments to security informants

and sources. In order to place the plan in effect, you were to discuss

Ise matter with each informant and source where circumstances warranted

wring the procedure and advise the Bureau by November 1, 1964, of the

Identity of each exempted informant and the method used by each such

Individual in reporting his Bureau income.

Communications being received from the field indicate that

the plan is being utilized for many informants but, at the same time,

thore are a great many instances where the informant has not had any

dilficulty in reporting his Bureau income in the past and, therefore,

these informants are being exempted by the field from the withholding

plan. The procedure was devised by the Bureau to afford informants

& method of reporting Bureau income in a secure manner and should

be utilized wherever necessary to prevent any embarrassing situations

In the future such as those which occur when an informant finds it

necessary to disclose his receipt of income from the FBI in response

to inquiries from Internal Revenue Service or it is later found that

taxes have not been paid on Bureau income. There should be no further

Instances of this type and you are reminded that if situations do arise

In the future where it is learned informants are not reporting Bureau

income and they have not used the withholding procedure, administrative

action will be considered by the Bureau in each such case.

these Introductions for the purpose of establishing greater

distribution, either on a personal basis or by mail, to newspaper,

radio and television contacts.

Columnists frequently ignore or

may not have access to wire service material, and these Introductions

should be made available to such writers since they are constantly

on the lookout for material for their columns.

carry miniature lethal weapons on their persons. Reportedly, one

of their several weapons is a derringer-type pistol with an over

and under barrel about the size of a charm, similar to the charms

on a woman's charm bracelet.

The top barrel fires a pellet which

the above individual claimed could kill an individual if it hits

him in a vital spot. The bottom barrel of the above pistol fires

a miniature tear gas pellet.

Another weapon utilized by SIM agents

1s a belt buckle fitted to fire two .32 short.

cartridges. SIM agents

also frequently carry switchblade-type knives which are fitted to

fire two .32 short cartridges, one from each end of the knife.

In view of the above information, extreme caution should

FLU VACCINE PROGRAM (1960-1961) -- Medical sources have

advocated flu shots this year, and the Bureau is again instituting

this program with inoculations on a cost-iree basis to all employees

who desire to participate. All Special Agents in Charge and Legal

Attaches must insure that every employee is informed of the

desirabillty of participating voluntarily in this program. Employees

should be encouraged to have such shots in an effort to reduce

absenteeism and conserve sick leave, particularly during the flu

season.

Although only approximately 52 per cent of employees

participated during the previous year, a study made by the Bureau

reflected beneficial results were ootained, particularly in those

areas where flu was most prevalent. Every effort should be made

by each supervisor for personal contacts with his subordinate

employees to encourage greater participation than demonstrated

in the previous year.

admissible in the Federal courts of that circuit.

of all Federal circuits.

It should be clearly understood that this new Federal

rule neither requires nor permits a Federal investigating officer

to arbitrarily reject relevant evidence on the ground that it was

seized illegally by State or local officers. The legality of

seizure is a question to be decided by the appropriate Federal

court, not by,

the Investigating officer.

Moreover, in deciding

the question

...ª Federal court must make an independent inquiry,

whether or not there has been such an inquiry by a State court,

and irrespective of how any such inquiry may have turned out.

The test is one of Federal law, neither enlarged by what one

state may have countenanced, nor diminished by what another may

have colorably suppressed."

Elkins v. U. S. supra. Under this

formula it is possible for a Federal court to decide that an

Item was legally seized and that it is admissible in evidence

even after courts of the state whose officers seized it have

held the seizure illegal under the law of that state. Obviously,

Federal officers investigating a Federal violation will not

arbitrarily reject relevant evidence which can be obtained

from

State or local officers even though it appears to have been seized

Illegally or a determination to that effect has actually been

made by the State courts.

In each such case the existence and

nature of the relevant evidence,

together with available infor-

mation on how it was obtained by the State or local officers,

must promptly be called to the attention of the U.S. Attorney

for his decision on whether an attempt will be made to use it

on the ground that, by federal standards. it was legally seizea.

Another important factor is that even such evidence as

has been seized illegally by Federal standards may yet be put

to certain uses in the

Federal courts. These uses are discussed

in SAC Letter 59-20 (I).

(E) PROPOSALS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CRIME COMMISSION --

There continue to be efforts on the part of numerous individuals

In law enforcement as well as legislative fields to foster the

formation of a National Crime Commission or some similar organized

Federal task force iu serve as a clearinghouse which would enable

Federal, state and local law enforcement units to maintain contact

with each other on organized crime matters.

The various proposals for the setting up of such an

organization

which have been advocated during the past several

-

years have been carefully analyzed by the Bureau.

As a result,

it has been found that the need for such an organization has not

been established and the possibility of it operating in a succesa-

ful manner cannot be envisioned. on the basis of plans suggested

to date.

Observations regarding the Bureau's belief that the

centralization of police power in a state or Federal agency was

both unnecessary and unwise appeared in the Law Enforcement

Bulletins of December 1, 1952, and January 1, 1953.

There are set forth below specific arguments against

the formation of such an organization and these are being furnished

to you for guidance in the event inquiries in this regard should

be directed to you. These are arguments which have been made

available to people who are opposed to this commission and are

being made available to the Field at this time.

They may be used

to refute arguments of those favoring a National Crime Commission.

At no time should a Special Agent in Charge endeavor to foster

these ideas unless it is necessary to refute claims to the contrary.

You should be alert to keep the Bureau informed of the identity

of any prominent police or other public officials who may take

a stand, publicly or otherwise, with regard to this question.

The following are a number of objections to the for-

mation of a National Crime Commission or similar type of clear-

inghouse.

1.

Human and legal rights demand that false, derogatory

Information which might injure reputation or character not be

published orally or in writing either by officials or others.

There is no insurance that information circulated by an organi-

zation of this type would be accurate unless it is supported by

records such as indictments, convictions and sentences. It is

doubtful that any group but

a regularly constituted, functioning

law enforcement agency could handle dissemination of criminal

intelligence-type information in such a manner that it would be

viewed in proper perspective and not lend itself to misuse.

No one should have the governmental authority to

characterize an individual as a racketeer or gangster.

It tne

law is violated it should be enforced and the violator brought

before the bar of justice.

If the law is not violated, who

should have such great authority as to engage in official name

calling, establish black lists or engage in acts of attainder

which even our Congress has no authority to do? Such would be

persecution, not prosecution.

3.

The dissemination of criminal intelligence information

by a so-called Federal clearinghouse or National Crime Commission

would possibly lead to some local arrests on the basis of a

Federal dossier without evidence.

Such arrests would be violations

of the civil rights of the accused.

4.

This would be a start toward a centralization of police

powers in a Federal agency.

The local peace officer and those

whom he serves would be deprived of their right to fully

supervise law enforcement in their own community.

5.

The proposed agency would be a step in creating a

national police agency which would first resort to reporting

fallures of a local agency to act on information which it fur-

nished. This it might do to show its service to the local police

and for purposes of self-perpetuation. The next short step

might be one of supervision.

This might be the first step in a

national control of law enforcement or a nationalization of police.

it is

6.

Even 1f there is some widespread operation of a

particular racketeer or group of racketeers, strict enforcement

of local laws will dry up the source of revenue and interest of

these racketeers. Thus the criminal overlord will receive no

profit from law

violators elsewhere if the local law is enforced.

What is needed is not more clearinghouses or Government bureaus

w th more

Federal taxes, but a will to enforce the law vigorously

11 police, prosecutors

and the courts,

Such an agency is the dream of wishful thinkers who

prefer to believe that there is a "void" ana a magic formula

io overcome it. By creation of such an agency the wishful

chinkers escape from the nard realism that there must be

continuous day-by-day hard work with no letup by local police

agencies and local prosecutors in order to have effective law

enforcement.

8.

A National Crime Commission or Federal clearinghouse

of information would constitute an unnecessary and costly

superstructure imposed on existing

establishments which are

already functioning effectively in the field of law enforcement

under well-established practices,

procedures arid laws. It

involve an unnecessary duplication of functions

confusion and harassment.

9.

Rather than the existence of a so-called "void," as

some claim exists, law enforcement agencies are now furnishing

available information in proper instances to other agencies, both

Federal and local.

The FBI alone furnishes several thousand items

of criminal information to law enforcement agencies throughout

the country each month. This is exclusive of services performed

by the Identification Division and FBI Laboratory. The FBI, as

in the case of all other agencies, receives similar coperation

and assistance.

This information is exchanged among regular law

enforcement otficers with an understanding of its nature and

therefore its proper application to the objectives of law enforce-

ment.

10.

Proposals to centralize law enforcement authority can

be quite unrealistic; they tend to assume that either the state

or Federal government can and should do for each community what

the people of that city or county will not do for themselves.

This is a somewhat naive view of the problems involved in

enforcing the law, & view based on the fallacious assumption

that in

"the government" there exists some magle method by

which all good things can be accomplished, regardless of the

will and the responsibility of the people. This is not the

case.

If the majority of the communities in a state are un-

able to enforce a law, either directly as a result of widespread

disobedience or indirectly from public apathy, we have no reason

to believe that some higher authority will be more successful.

Experience during the prohibition era is strong evidence bearing

on this point.

newspapers publish features on various phases of FBI operations

in holiday editions by contacting the newspapers two or three

(G) • STREAMLINING COMMITTEES - FIELD OFFICES - Re SAC Letters

58-69 (E) and 59-53 (I) .

All employees should be made aware of the fact that

suggestions are encouraged as a means of improving Bureau ei-

ficiency and economy. I want each employee to understand that

he should send any suggestion he makes directly to me so. that

I can insure that each suggestion receives appropriate attention.

Likewise, suggestions originating with streamlining committees

must be sent directly to me without consideration or recommendation

by the committees.

Should the need for the opinion of the stream-

lining committee arise following receipt of a suggestion at the

Bureau, It will be returned to the field division whence it

emanated and such opinion solicited.

These instructions should not be construed as eliminating

the necessity for streamlining committees which must still seek

ways and means of improving operations and procedures.

However,

(H) ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE - FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT --

Public Law 86-695, approved 9/2/60, amends captioned Statute

(Sections 51-54,

Title 41, USC), violations of which are handled

by the Bureau under the FAG classification. This Statute penalizes

payments of fees, gifts or gratuities by subcontractors to prime

contractors or higher tier contractors holding U. S. Government

contracts for purposes of securing awards or orders. Formerly

the Statute applied to cost-plus-a-fixed fee or cost reimbursable

contracts.

As amended it now applies to negotiated contracts

regardless of their nature.

Negotiated contracts are defined

as those made without formal advertising.

The foregoing change should be mentioned in your

regular liaison contacts with military installations, large

Industrial plants handling Government work, and other potential

sources of cases of this type.

(I) COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF DOMINICAN EXILE GROUPS - INTERNAI

SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - Unsettled political conditions

in the Dominican Republic point to the inevitable fall

..of the

Trujillo regime. One of the biggest problems facing any new

Dominican Government will be to prevent communist exiles from

returning to the Dominican Republic and gaining some measure of

control in the Dominican-Government: -As the Dominican political

situation continues to deteriorate, there is a good possibility

that communist Dominican exiles in Cuba, Venezuela, and Mexico

will attemot to gain control of Dominican exile groups in the

United States, looking forward to key roles these groups may

play in any new Dominican Government.

All offices should be alert to the above problem in

• their coverage of Dominican activities. It is essential that

there be an active collection of data of this type in the course

of investigations of Dominican and communist matters. All offices

should also be alert to any attempts by the Communist Party, USA,

to agitate on behalf of communist Dominican exiles for key roles

In any new Dominican Government. Data obtained should be sub-

has been indicaied that there is a strong demand for FBI

Fingerprint Schools in the field.

At present, ten field

d'visions do not have a qualified fingerprint

instructor.

Tiê Bureau realizes that-it may not be desirable to have a

ingerprint instructor in each division as the needs of the

livision may be adequately and economically handled by

instructors from nearby divisions.

A number of field divisions

are not conducting more than one fingerprint school a year.

Although we do not solicit police schools, each SAC should

evaluate his divisional needs and advise the Bureau,

attention Training and Inspection Division, within thirty

days whether he considers additional police instructors

qualified In fingerprint training are necessary or desirable.

Any SAC who deems additional fingerprint instructors necessary

for his division should prepare adequate justification and

should advise as to the manner in which the needs of his

division have been previously handled.

In the number of accidents and in the number of accidents

in Charge must continue to take a very special interest in

You should particularly stress the

necessity for reducing the number of rear-end and intersection

collisions.

There is no reason why employees should not at

all times maintain cars operated by them under sufficient

control to avoid colliding with cars in front of them.

Furthermore, there generally is no excuse for an employee

• to be involved in an intersection collision. Reasonable

alertness in approaching and crossing an intersection would

certainly avert a major percentage of these accidents.

SECURITY INDEX - CUBA - The possibility of a break In

relations between the United States and Cuba or a limited

emergency growing out of the Cuban situation requires that

we plan now to meet any responsibilities arising from such

an eventuality.

The Bureau desires to tabulate as "pro-Cuban" all -

individuals now on, and subsequently added to, the security

Index whose activities and sympathies have been such that

they

warrant special consideration in the event of a limited

emergency involving Cuba and the U. S.

This tabulation will

Include not only tubans but also non-Cubans who have been

engaged in substantial activities in furtherance of the alms

and purposes of the Cuban Government, in support of pro-

Castro groups or organizations or in furtherance of the

communist or subversive infiltration of pro-Castro groups.

This tabulation will be effected at the Bureau based

on recommendations from the field. With regard to individuals

now on the security Index who should be so tabbed, Form FD-122

should be submitted promptly with the notation "Pro-Cuban"

typed directly opposite the words

"Miscellaneous (specify)"

in the space provided on the form.

Attached to the Form FD-122

should be an additional page containing a concise summary of

facts which prompt the recommendation for this tabbing.

These

instructions in no way affect the character of cases under

which subjects are currently being investigated.

Careful consideration should be given at this time

to recommending for inclusion in the Security Index those

individuals who are not now on the Security Index but who,

in the light of the clear and present identification of the

Cuban Government as procommunist, pro-soviet Bloc and anti-

United States, would be deemed dangerous or potentially

dangerous to the internal security of the U. S. in the event

of an emergency Involving Cuba and the U.S.

In considering whether the facts clearly and un-

mistakably depict a subject as a dangerous individual who

could be expected to commit acts inimical to the national

defense and public safety in such an eventuallty, there

should be a substantial showing of data within the following

standards:

(a)

An Individual has served as a leader or officer

or has substantially participated in the activities of a pro-

Castro organization and has

engaged in activities which have

Included either the preparation or distribution of pro-Cuban

or anti-U. S. propaganda; the active collection of funds for any

agency or

representative of the Cuban Government or for a pro-

Or stro group, which funds are not intended for the relief of

I man suffering or other charitable purposes; active participation

n acts of violence against anti-Castro individuals or groups or

sgainst the United States; or the active collection of Intel-

ligence data regarding the national defense of the United States

or which would serve the purposes of the Cuban Government as

opposed to the interests of the United States, where there are

reasonable grounds to believe that such data is to be or has

been conveyed to any agency or representative of the Cuban

Government.

(b) An individual, whether he has participated in

organizational activity or not, has engaged in one of more

activities specified in (a) above and it has been clearly

established,

by overt acts or statements or other evidence,

that there are reasonable. grounds to believe the loyalty of

the individual would lie with the Cuban Government in the event

of armed conflict between the Cuban Government and the United.

States.

(c)

In connection with all individnals recommended

for addition to the Security Index in consideration of these

standards there must be a clear showing, by overt acts or

statements or other evidence, that there has been a continuing

sympathy for the aims and objectives of the Cuban Government

since October 1, 1960. This is absolutely essential in view

of the rising tide of disillusion with and defection from

the Cuban Government.

When recommending additional subjects for the

Security Index in consideration of the above factors sound

judgment must be exercised in order to assure the weight of

evidence justifies inclusion.

for recommendation for inclusion must be established through

reliable informants, sources or individuals or by physical

evidence and must be concisely set forth in the succinct summary

of facts appearing on the reguired additional page or pages

attached to the Form FD-122.

Since the courses of action which

might be followed in the event of a limited emergency would, in

• all probability, be different for aliens as distinguished from

U.S. citizens it is imperative that the citizenship status of

these individuals be clearly established. The same procedure

for tabbing these individuals as

"Pro-Cuban" should be followed

as set out hereinbefore.

In view of above, all offices must be most alert to

develop and collect data indicating plans and activities of the

communists with regard to the Dominican situation.

In addition,

It Is felt that there is a definite need at this time for a

co-ordinated compilation of data, now in individual case files,

which will give a clear and complete picture of the over-all

• extent of communist infiltration of Dominican exile groups.

Accordingly, New York, Miami, san duan,

Field Office, and Legal

Washington

Attache, Mexico offices which handle

most of our Dominican investigations) are Instructed to prepare

reports suitable for dissemination under the above caption and

such reports are to contain a complete and comprehensive survey

of the extent of communist infiltration among these exile groups.

Reports should not only show the extent of communist infiltration

within each group but reports should also contain a separate

section whereby subversive information concerning

• individuals

themselves is set forth separately under the names of the

individuals involved. Plan format of reports carefully,

utilizing appropriate headings for sake of clarity wherever

possible. Preparation of reports will necessitate thorough

file review of closed as well as pending cases. possibly supple-

mented by current contacts with established sources wherever

necessary.

In order to avoid duplication of the compilation of

this data, confine reporting to data from cases of which

particular office 1s office of origin. If pertinent data

1s

discovered during file reviews which would not fall within

this guide, the office discovering such information should

Include it in its report in order to make certain that all

pertinent information is reported. Remember the main purpose

of this survey is to make available within this control file

the complete current situation regarding communist infiltration

Into Dominican groups and to maintain such control file on a

current basis.

Deadline for Initial report is 45 days and supplemental

reports should be submitted at 45-day intervals.

New York is

designated as office of origin.

Although report writing phase of this survey at this

time Is confined to above-mentioned offices, all offices should

be alert to problem here, especially in view of our far-reaching

Informant coverage in the communist field. Data secured should

be submitted promptly to Bureau under above caption.

(A) : LEAVE MATTERS -- Any employee who can be spared should be

granted leave over the Christmas-New Year's holidays with pref-

erence being given those who have not had a vacation during the

year for leave over one or both of the holidays. Special

attention shoula also be given the requests of new employees.

Employees who have been with us less than ninety days, and thus

cannot take annual leave, may be granted up to four workdays

of leave without pay (LWO?) if they can be spared.

Employees

who have been here 90 days or longer will not be allowed to

take any LWOP; however, they may take any available annual

leave, consistent with the first sentence above. In scheduling

leave or IWOP, you must bear in mind the condition of the work;

annual leave or IWOP should not be granted if to do so will

Increase the work delinquency.

A holiday is charged as IWoP when it intervenes in a

period of IWOP; thus if an employee is on LWOP December 23

through December 28, 1960, four days of IWOP must be charged for

this absence although only three are workdays. If the employee

Is absent only on December 23, 1960, returning to work

December 27, 1960, only one day will be charged as LWOP.

A11

IWOP granted

under the four-workday rule is to be reported on

the Time and Attendance Card and no special communication

-

should be submitted to the Bureau.

The 1960 leave year ends January 7, 1961. Employees

having a maximum accumulation of thirty or more days should

understand that leave earned in the current leave year but

unused at the close of the leave year is forfeited. Likewise,

If more leave than earned during the leave year is used during

the leave year, their maximum accumulation is lowered. Your

leave schedule should be so arranged as to permit employees to

take annual leave

they request

and which they would otherwise

lose.

The Bureau's concurrence must be secured when it is

proposed to deny an employee's request with the result he will

forfeit leave.

alone. One such instructor requested that he be removed as a

general police Instructor and only utilized in fingerprint

Instruction because he felt more comfortable teaching the latter

subject.

The Bureau has gone to considerable expense to train

i slice Instructors and does not intend to relleve an Agent of such

ssignments merely because he prefers some other type of work.

This is consistent with the Bureau's long-standing policy that

Agents are not permitted to choose their assignments.

Of course, it is essential that police instruction be

of the highest caliber in order to maintain the Bureau's pre-

eminence in this field. If you feel that an Instructor should

no longer be utilized because of a deterioration in his performance,

conflicting investigative assignments, or any other reason which

would serve the Bureau's best interests, you should immediately

submit your recommendation with full justification. You should

not recommend his removal based solely on his personal preference.

for any deficiencies in police schools, including an evaluation

of Agents' capabilities and performance.

(A) SOUND SCHOOL TRAINING --

The Bureau desires that you submit

the names of all Special Agents in your field division who are

seriously interested in receiving sound school training. A

tichnical background, such as that gained through formal education

i science, engineering and technical subjects or through

sractical experience in telephony, radio communication and

electronic repair, is most desirable, although not absolutely

necessary. Lacking that, an Agent should possess considerable

mechanical aptitude and proficiency. A factual, detailed

statement should be provided as to each Agent's technical •

background or mechanical proficiency in order to permit a

worthwhile evaluation of his capability.

Due to the fact that sound installations involve

confidential techniques, the Agent selected should not be one

widely known to police officers, hoodlums and security subjects,

since his being recognized during his work might seriously

jeopardize the security of an installation.

Experience in the

past has shown that maximum utilization of

• this specialized

training and of the technical equipment supplied each office

is realized only when the Sound-Trained Agent is assigned to

headquarters city.

A reply, marked to the attention of the FBI Laboratory,

should be submitted within thirty days after the receipt of this

letter.

SENSITIVE METHODS DELETED

YOUTH PROGRAM OF THE CPUSA

At the 17th National Convention of the CPUSA held

In New York City December 12-14, 1959, the EUSA

set up a

program which was designed to produce a comunist youth

organization in the United States. The Party implemented

this program by naming Daniel Mortimer Rubin as National

Secretary for Youth, and Rubin

has been touring a large part

of the United States in order to complete tie organization

of a communist youth group.

This organization will encompass

all classes of young people, including college students.

The

Party hopes that in addition to other groups it will eventually

have communist youth groups on college campses.

All offices were alerted to this program by letter

of June 21, 1960, entitled "CPUSA, Youth Matters, Internal

Security - C" and to the necessity to have complete coverage

of CP activity in youth matters.

The Party is expected shortly

to establish this youth organization, and me must, be ready for

this evertuallty. If you have not already done so, alert

established informants so we will be advised Immediately of

the location of any youth groups set up anywhere in the country.

Consideration should be given to making contacts with coopera-

tive officials of institutions of learning so that we may

become aware of the emergence on campuses of groups dominated

by the CP. In addition, through a review of

campus publi

cations information may be elicited concerning the formation of

communist youth groups on campuses.

The Party is keenly

aware of the need to develop an effective program among youth,

and you should be alert to develop and maintain the necessary

informant coverage of this activity.

TOPLEV PROGRAM

Through this program of contacting METHOD

com-

munists as potential informants it has been possible to obtain

the services of many excellent informants. By contacting

carefully selected subjects and utilizing new specific ap-

proaches, additional informants can be developed which would

insure continuation:"

METHOD

coverage of the CPUSA. By

separate communication all 14 Toplev offices are being

Instructed to conduct an analysis of subjects previously

approached and select individuals for reinterview at this

time by utilizing specific new approaches.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

Any office where there is any degree of concen-

tration of communists (although not a regular participant

in the Program should consider the possible application

of counterintelligence techniques specifically aimed at

causing disruption or disillusionment inside Party circles.

Bureau approval must be obtained before any action can be .

taken.

All proposals must be carefully evaluated prior to

submission so it can clearly be stated that the action

recommended will not embarrass the Bureau or jeopardize

CONTROL - INTERVIEW OF FORMER INFORMANTS BY SAC

Strict control over informants is absolutely

necessary

to prevent embarrassment to the Bureau and

jeopardizing our informant program.

In order to minimize

situations which could arise after discontinuance of in-

-formants, whenever the contacting Agent feels a discontinued

Informant could cause embarrassment to the Bureau arrangement.

should be made to have the former informant come to the field

office where he will be personally met by the SAC. At that

time he should be impressed with the fact that his services

were appreciated and were of considerable assistance to the

national defense of the country, and he will be reminded

that he signed an agreement when he was active as an Informant

to maintain his relation with the Bureau on a confidential

basis.

The SAC will stress the necessity for the informant

to maintain this confidence. This procedure should be placed

in effect immediately.

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, UNDERGROUND OPERATIONS

CP leaders have discussed the possibility of the

Party going underground in the event the forthcoming Supreme

Court decision on the Internal Security Act of 1950 requires

the CPUSA to register with the Attorney General. Party

leaders feel the decision may be against the Party and it

will have to go underground.

Betty Gannett, member of the

National Committee and educational director

of the New York

State CP, has been instructed to formulate a plan which could

be used to establish an underground apparatus.

All offices

were advised by letter of November 2, 1960, to be alert for

all activities of the Party throughout the country in this

connection and efforts should be concentrated on developing

sources and informants among individuals on the fringe of

communist activity as such persons were used to great

advantage by the Party when it went underground in the 1950s.

Efforts should be made to obtain the actual blueprint which

the Party will follow if it goes underground. Current

informants should be alert for any discussion of this matter

In the Party and be ready to place themselves in positions

whereby they can provide information regarding the development

of any underground activity.

(E) • STREAMLINING PROCEDURES - CHANNELIZING MEMORANDA -- Numerous

channelizing mémoranda, particularly in large offices operating a

large number of live Informants, are presenting an increasingly

critical space problem and demands for extra file cabinets.

In June, 1960, the Chicago and San Francisco Offices

were authorized to destroy channelizing memoranda following

submissIon of reports in security cases on an experimental basis

to determine the feasibility of adopting this practice throughout

the field.

Based upon the favorable results obtained in these offices,

particularly in savings in file space and streamlining of case files,

the Bureau is authorizing the destruction of these channelizing

memoranda following submission of reports in both individual and

organizational security cases.

In devising procedures for the handling of this matter

you should be guided by the following:

(1). The current procedure with regard to filing the

original informant report, the filing of the master channelizing

tiemoranda in the informant file and the serializing of channelizing

memoranda in the substantive case files will be continued as at

present.

(2) The Agent, at the time he dictates the report, will

prepare a memorandum listing the channelizing memoranda to be

destroyed by serial or serial scope and requesting the Chief Clerk's

Office to destroy.

The memorandum should indicate that pertinent

Information contained in the serials to be destroyed was incorporated

in the report.

It will not be necessary to set forth in this

destruction memorandum the file and serial number of original

Informant reports or master

channelizing memoranda as this information

will be listed in the cover pages to the report. In the case of

multiple volumes, the destruction memorandum should be prepared by

the Agent in sufficient numbers so that one copy will appear in

each volume of the multiple volume file being stripped.

(3) Prior to destruction, the Agent's recommendations

with respect thereto are to be reviewed and approved by the

Supervisor at the time he reviews and approves the report.

(4) Following destruction of the channelizing memoranda

the Chief Clerk will so note on the memorandum. Thereafter, the

memorandum will be filed in the case file as a permanent record

of the serials destroyed.

Technical and microphone surveillance channelizing

memoranda may be destroyed without the necessity of identifying

in the cover pages of the report the exact location in the ollice

files of the original information.

The use of an asterisk

Identifies the source and the original information can be readily

l' cated.

The channellzing memorandum should not be destroyed in

she following instances:

(1) When the original information is not contained

elsewhere in your office.

(2) Do not destroy serial one of a file regardless

of its nature.

(3) Do not destroy any serial containing indexing.

It would appear that if indexing was necessary to channelizing

memoranda, such indexing would only be done in the main case

Ifle as set

forth in the title of

the communication.

(4) Do not destroy serial showing "action" information.

for example,

opening, closing, posting, or instructions given

by a Supervisor to an Agent concerning

the case.

The destruction of these channelizing memoranda should

be subject to close supervisory control by you to insure that all

pertinent information contained in these memoranda is reported

In the investigative report.

(A) CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM - I desire to insure that

each office is fulfilling its obligations under this program

and to be certain we have that type of coverage of the criminal

underworld comparable to that which we achieved in our investi-

gations of the Communist Party. To this end, the techniques

which have proved so Invaluable In the Internal Security fIeld

must be carefully considered and adapted wherever feasible to

our criminal intelligence operations. Present policy regarding

tesurs must be adhered to.

We

must continue all-out efforts in our investigation

of specific hoodlum subjects; however, it is imperative that

you understand the necessity for maintaining on the criminal

underworld intelligence coverage as effective and productive

as has been established in other major intelligence operations.

The personnel of each office concerned with criminal intelligence

matters must be thoroughly briefed and indoctrinated so that

they understand the Bureau's aims and the importance of obtaining

true Intelligence information on the underworld.

You should carefully evaluate this situation in the

- above perspective and follow through with a planned program

to develop high-level live Informants as well as sources who

can produce significant information as to underworld activities.

It cannot be stressed

too strongly that this matter

1s to receive your personal attention and that having understood

the Bureau's objective, effective and vigorous action is to be

exerted to accomplish the aims outlined.

(A) LABORATORY MATTERS - PHOTOGRAPHY OF EVIDENCE - The FBI

Laboratory has noted a growing tendency of investigative personnel

•to use the FINGERPRINI CAMERA to photograph document

heel print,

and similar evidence. Because of the small field (2) by 32)

covered by this camera, it 1s often impossible to record the

entire area that must be photographed on one negative, making

It necessary to record the evidence by sections on several

separate negatives.

In some instances even individual signatures

or heel impressions have been reproduced in this manner. Such

photography unnecessarily complicates examinations in the

Laboratory and may hinder or limit the use of such evidence in

a court of law.

Every field division has available Speed Graphic

- cameras equipped for document photography which can be adjusted

to include an entire document or other evidence in one negative.

To properly record evidence photographically, the Speed Graphic

camera should be use wienever the area to be photographed is:.

greater than 24 by 34.

This matter should be brought to the attention of all

Investigative personnel, and it is expected that in the future -

documentary and similar

evidence will not be recorded photo-

graphically by sections merely because it is more convenient

to use the Fingerprint Camera.

Of course, where large numbers

of documents are to be photographed, the field should continue

to use one of the 35 mm or other camera units designed for

document photography.

(D) REPORT WRITING - SECURITY CASES. -- It has been noted that

on occasions some field offices fail

to include In security

reports information previously submitted for dissemination by

Apparently this omission is made on the

theory that to include it in a subsequent report would be

repetitious and an unnecessary expenditure of time.

Page 33,

Part I, FBI Handbook, Indicates the results of investigations

In security cases should generally be submitted in reports,

and page 31, Part I, FBI Handbook, defines a report as a

written document containing the results of an investigation

as of a certain date.

According to this definition, a report

should be complete in itself and should contain all

pertinent

and material information obtained since the submission.of a

previous report or since the Inception of an investigation.

This is being called to your attention so that in

the future there will be no misunderstanding and all field

offices will, when submitting reports in security cases, include

succinctly all pertinent and material Information previously

submitted for dissemination in letterhead memoranda. You are

also cautioned that letterhead memoranda containing information

which will later be placed in reports should only be submitted

when it is believed expeditious dissemination of the particular.

Information must be made and time is of the essence.

These instructions are intended to amplify..and not to

change in any way present rules relating to report writing.

(A) BUREAU AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS -- There has been an Increase

of twenty-five accidents involving Bureau cars during the first

emphasis on

safe driving practices and insure that all Bureau

drivers exercise the highest degree of caution in the operation

of the Bureau's automotive equipment.

During the past two or three months there have been a

number of reported brake failures on Bureau cars which contributed

to accidents.

Employees responsible for the operation, inspection

and maintenance of Bureau cars must be constantly alert for any

advance warning of possible brake failure. and when such warning

1s noted the vehicle should be removed from service, thoroughly

Inspected and corrective action taken to insure the venicle is

A large metropolitan police department reported they

had experienced a number of brake failures particularly while

cars equipped with automatic. transmissions were being used on

high-speed chases and fast-moving surveillances. Inspection

of the cars disclosed no mechanical derects; nowever, they

discovered that some of their officers were

the need for constant re-evaluation of our informant coverage in

Informants of this type should be developed not only to obtain

new cases for prosecution but for utilization on a long range

basis in order to provide continuous intelligence information

concerning organized crime.

Through well-placed informants we

must infiltrate organized crime groups to the same degree that

we have been able to penetrate the Communist Party and other

subversive organizations. Our coverage in this field must be

just as extensive and effective as that achieved in security

matters. Our responsibilities in these areas cannot be over-

emphasized.

Today the press. television, and radio along with the

express interests of the Administration keep this phase of

criminal activity in a position of prominence in the public eye.

Certainly we cannot relax even momentarily our efforts in

combating the criminal underworld including the prosecution of

In April of 1960 the New York Office exercised

excellent Initiative in recognizing. that a pattern of activities.

In the United States favoring African nationalism was emerging

and in instituting a semiannual reporting procedure to present

an over-all picture of such developments.

Several field offices

were drawn into this reporting procedure; however, the recent

demonstrations in the United States indicate the desirability

of an alertness on the part of all field offices to activities

of this type taking place in the various Bureau field office

territories.

In this connection, therefore, the Bureau desires

to utilize this file to collect a concise and factual over-all

picture from all field offices of just what pattern is developing

in the activities of African nationals in the United States and

In the activities of individuals and groups here who seek to

exploit the issue of African nationalism. It must be borne in

mind that the increasing influx of African students, who are

attending educational institutions throughout the United States,

zationa]. we be most alert not only to agitational and organi-

activities of the students themselves,

but also to

the problem of uncovering pressures brought to

bear on them

and/or efforts to organize them by nationalists or subversive

elements.or by representatives_of..other nations.

In view of current developments in captioned matter,.

reporis should be submitted by each office on January 15,

April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year until further

notice.

Eight copies of reports should be furnished to the

Bureau. After reports are submitted which will afford an

over-all picture of the situation confronting each office

negative reports should not be submitted but a letter should

be submitted indicating there is no change in the existing

picture.

This file should be utilized as a control file

to present a concise picture of

the problem. It is not

designed as a catchall for reporting individual case activity.

Any data warranting investigation of organizations, groups or

Individuals should be handled in separate case files and only

that data pertinent to showing the over-all picture should be

repeated in this file.

'Information concerning racist activities

in the United States which are unrelated to African nationalist

activities should not be included in reports in this case.

(J CUBAN-ALIEN REFUGEE REPORTS Bureau has arranged for_

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) offices locally to

furnish copies of reports pertaining to Cuban alien refugees in

the United States to Bureau offices at field level.

These reports

generally contain brief Identifying data concerning the alien

including his whereabouts at the time he was interviewed by INS.

They are normally submitted on INS Form I-161. While active

investigation of these Individuals is not desired in the absence •

of allegations indicating they are procommunist,

pro-soviet,

anti-American, pro-Castro or are engaged in activities which

would bring them within our investigative jurisdiction, they

represent an excellent potential from whom intelligence information

can be obtained and sources of information developed.

a common:

Offices receiving these reports should carefully review

them with the thought in mind of interviewing the alien refugees

on a selective basis for the purpose of developing intelligence

data and assessing their potential as informants or sources in

Cuban matters.

It is realized that many refugees may not have

-

Information; however, you should bear in mind that if there is

an indication a refugee was involved in counterrevolutionary

activities he probably has information concerning such activities

in Cuba.

If refugee was Cuban official, it would be logical to

expect he would have information concerning communist and Soviet

orientation of Castro officials. Likewise, if he was in public

relations field he could be expected to have data dealing with

Cuban propaganda activity. Prior to conducting such interviews,

review your office indices and if the data received from INS or

the data located in your files indicates that a check of Bureau

files would be desirable prior to the interview, then an expedite

check of Bureau files should be requested. Sufficient back-

ground data should be furnished to facilitate this check. Your

Interviews should be designed to determine the full scope of

each

refugee's knowledge and this should be clearly shown in

reporting the results of the interviews. This will enable the

Bureau and any other field office having a direct interest in

the data to request additional information on specific points

where desirable.

Pertinent concrete Information elicited from the

refugees would be of interest not only to the Bureau but also

to other Government agencies. For this reason you should submit

the results of such interviews under an appropriate caption in

a form suitable for dissemination, submitting nine copies to

the Bureau.

Where warranted, appropriate investigations should

be instituted on the basis of data obtained from these refugees.

There 1s no need to obtain Bureau permission for these interviews

unless some unusual circumstance exists.

Advise the Bureau of

the results of all interviews conducted.

(A) FBI SUGGESTION PROGRAM -- In connection with the Bureau's

Suggestion Program, It has been noted that a number of

suggestions

have been received

which, although they appear meritorious on

the surface, actually would create more paper work or other

administrative burden than they would relieve if adopted. This

is not meant to discourage creative thought on the part of our

ministrative burdeneral

employees, but should be borne in mind when considering the

merits of each proposal.

In addition, where savings of a tangible nature are

anticipated through the adoption of a suggestion, a statement

Indicating, as far as possible, the amount to be realized in

savings should be set forth in the suggestion or accompanying

comments.

Inis is necessary so that the suggestor may receive

due consideration for recognition under the Incentive Awards

Program 1f his suggestion is adopted. In the past, it has

been necessary on occasions for the Suggestions Desk to go

back to the Division where the suggestion originated and have

this point covered.

This causes delay in processing the sug-

gestion and unnecessary communications.

(C) PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - During the recent retrial of a Bureau

case, a Government witness on cross-examination refused to reveal

her current address because she feared for her own safety and

that of her child. When Court was adjourned for the day the

Judge ordered the FBI to take the witness into protective custody

until she completed her testimony.

The protection of a witness is clearly within the

function of the United States Marshal's Office. The arbitrary

action of the Judge in this case is a most undesirable precedent

and may be seized upon by other Judges in the future to involve

us in a situation outside our primary duties.

In the event of a similar request in the future,

you should advise the United States Attorney to point out

the court the function of the United States Marshal with respect

to the protection of witnesses.-

Is comprised of representatives of law enforcement organizations

located for the most part in the far West and particularly in

California. However, recent additions in its membership in-

cluded representatives from police agencies as far eastward

Ohio and Florida. These members exchange data on hoodlums,

gangsters and organized crime. Collection and dissemination

of information are handled through the California State Bureau

of Criminal Identification and Investigation at Sacramento.

The Bureau has taken no part in the activities of

the Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit (LEIU) since It was

organized in 1956.

This organization is holding an annual meeting at

Reno, Nevada, on April 13 - 14, 1961. The existence of the

organization is being called to your attention in order that

you will be acquainted with lis operations in the event any

Information concerning it should be referred to your office.

In the event you learn of any new agencies being accepted as

members of LEIU or of any other information of interest con-

cerning the organization, the Bureau should be advised. You

should take no action with respect to the activities of this

organization and no comment should be made with respect to

The first time the name appears in either the title or the

The code number should appear in sequence

such a manner that there will be no question as to which name

The title should, of course, include the name as

It is actually used by the

person himself.

Index cards on

Chinese names should include the CIC number when it is avail-

able. The CTC number is a valuable factor for identification

or elimination purposes but it should not be relied upon to

the exclusion of other information.

Instances have occurred

where two persons have the same number or where two numbers

are ascribed to the same individual.

(F.): NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - CUBA - On February 13, 1961,

ThIRD AGENCY CONSIDERATION

Each field office should assure that all pertinent data

relating to such inaividuals is referred on a continuing basis

to the appropriate local office of INS in order that action by

INS looking toward possible exclusion, deportation, expatriation

or denaturalization may be properly considered.

You will note that INS Investigative action in these

matters requires

specific clearance with the FBI.

In view of

INS objectives and in view of the tense Cuban situation clearance

should be granted upon request unless INs investigation of a

particular individual would definitely interfere with a pending

Investigation or jeopardize your own interests in an individual.

When clearance for INS investigation is not granted the Bureau

should be advised promptly. by airtel under the caption of the

Individual case of

the denial and the reasons thereror.

Any

pending action which prompts the denial should be expedited in

order that clearance can be granted INS as soon as practical..

When granting clearance for INS investigative action be certain

that arrangements are effected whereby you will be advised by

INS of pertinent data develoved and of any proceedings instituted

regarding

subjects of interest to your office.

THIRD AGENCY CONSIDERATION

You

order to implement their instructions, may request data regaraing

the

Castro cause. Pertinent data should be supplied.

Any problems experienced by field offices in connection

with INs activities in this regard should be brought to the

attention of the Bureau promptly.

NONDISCRIMINATION - GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT POLICY - GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS -- By Executive Order 10925 dated March 6, 196f, the

President abolished the President's Committee on Government Employ-

ment Policy and the Government Contracts Committee and in lieu

thereof established the President's Committee on Equal Employment

Opp rtunity.:

The President reaffirmed the policy that there be

no liscrimination against any employee or applicant for employment

in the Federal Government or with contractors doing business with

t) Government and delegated to the new committee the authority

tr implement this policy. A copy of the Executive Order is enclosed.

As regards rules for effectuating the policy and

provisions of Executive Order 10925 throughout the Department, the

Attorney General by Departmental Order 239-61 dated March 17, 1961,

reaffirmed regulations in this regard

prescribed by the Departmental

Order 105-55 dated November 21, 1955.

He specified that all

references in that Order to the President's Committee on Government

Employment Policy shall be deemed to be references to the President's

Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity.

This instruction by the

Attorney General means there is.no substantive change in provisions

for complying with the nondiscrimination program.

Manual' revisions

are being prepared.

At this time I want to strongly remind you of the prime

importance of insuring that each applicant for any Bureau position-

is given consideration based entirely on his merit and fitness and

without regara for his. race, color, religion,

or national origin.

In view of the ever-increasing challenges facing the Bureau and

our country, it is absolutely imperative that we make the best use

•of the human resources available so as to assure that our responsi-

bilities are discharged in the best possible manner.

This requires

alertness and application at every level of our recruitment program,

from contact with possible applicants through interview and investi-

gation, to insure that the best qualified are eventually extended

appointments.

You should emphasize this to all personnel who have

anywhere in the service are referred to the Bureau for appropriate

consideration.

(A) NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - The increasing anti-United States

attitudes and demonstrations stemming from the cuban situation and

"cold war" tensions are cause for concern and must be taken Iudly

into account in connection with our investigative efforts.

There has been recent evidence of

hostility anc

I lligerence on the part of pro-castro Cubans auring attempted

aterviews by Special Agents.

The Bureau has also received data

ndicating that the Communist Party of Mexico planned violent action

gainst Special Agents of the FBI and Americans in Mexico.

equent data indicated the Communist Party of Mexico planned to

prepare black lists of Americans in Mexico, to identify Special

Agents of the FBI and agents of the Central Intelligence Agency

and place them under surveillance, and to seize Americans and

them as hostages in the event of war with Russia. Plans

were made to conduct surveillances of members of the Communist

Party of Mexico suspected of being informants.

A war of nerves

was contemplated involving planned damage to property and sabotage

with wide-scale sabotage efforts planned in the event of war,

Including the organization, arming and training of militia from

farm and labor elements to be used to defend Cuba if necessary.

This hostility and the grave steps contemplated undoubtedly

were

touched.off as a part of an emotional reaction to the invasion

of Cuba by anti-Castro elements. They are, however, clear evidence

of what we should be prepared to contend with now and in the event

anti-United States tensions increase.

The planned actions of the

Communist Party of Mexico demonstrate forcefully the capacity of

a subversive organization to react militantly to an emergency

situation.

The activities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee

In the United States reveal clearly the capacity of a nationality

group organization to mobilize its efforts in such a situation

so as to arrange demonstrations and influence public opinion.

Each Special Agent in Charge should assure that investi-

gations and interviews related to nationality group activity are

conducted with due caution and careful consideration of the safety

of personnel handling this work.

Care should be taken not to

provoke hostility.

Border offices should be particularly cautious

In view of the militant hostility and reported plans of the Com-

munist Party of Mexico.

The existing situation is such that all field offices

must be most alert to the possibility of demonstrations by

nationality groups

which could lead to incidents involving

violence. Advise local police of such demonstrations at once

PERFORMANCE RATINGS - A review of the annual performance

raiings recently submitted clearly indicates that rating and

reviewing officials have not completely familiarized themselves

with Instructions set out in the Manual of Rules and Regulations,

I, Section 5, pertaining to performance ratings. Further.-

more, in evaluating employee performance many rating and review-

Ing officials have failed

to give due consideration to such

important matters as disciplinary action, limited duty, voluntary

overtime and the weight program.

It was obvious some ratings

had been written without sufficient preparation and care and

had not been thoroughly reviewed before being transmitted to

the Bureau. This resulted in needless delay in processing the

ratings, as well as in unnecessary correspondence. Responsibility

for the proper evaluation of employee performance and the ac-

curacy of performance ratings rests with the rating and reviewing

officials and herearter they will be held strictly accountable

for every error, deviation from instructions and failure to

• properly evaluate the employee's performance.

The following are some of the items which have been

the source of considerable correspondence and are being set forth

for your future guidance.

NN 55044 DooId: 32989526 Page 831

---

## Page 832

(1) Failure to give due consideration to administrative

action taken against an employee during the rating period.

Certainly an employee who has been the recipient of several

letters of censure or has been the subject of more severe

administrative action during the rating period is not entitled

to an adjective rating of Excellent.

(2) Failure to give due consideration to the physical

condition of an employee.

It should be obvious that a Special

Agent who has been on limited duty during the greater portion of

the rating period 1s not entitled to a satisfactory rating in

physical fitness nor is he entitled to more than a Satisfactory

the entreet to more

adjective rating since he cannot perform all of the duties

required of a Special Agent and his assignments must be controlled...

It is the personal responsibility of the rating and reviewing

officials to insure that employees with physical limitations are

properly rated.

Some rating and reviewing officials have not given

due consideration to the employee's efforts to comply with the

Bureau's weight standards and to equitably share the work load.

It is difficult for the Bureau to understand how an employee who

has not complied with the weight standards or whose overtime has

been consistently below the office average can be rated excellent

or outstanding in attitude.

(4) There have been a number of instances in which

ratings afforded employee on the rating guide and check list

and/or the narrative comments have not supported the adjective

rating afforded the employee.

In some instances the ratings

on the rating guide and check list have been inconsistent with

the narrative comments. The fact that an employee is rated

excellent or outstanding on the majority of the items on the

rating guide and check list does not automatically entitle him

to an Excellent adjective rating.

It should be obvious that

although all of the items on the

rating guide and check list

are important, some of the items, such as attitude, judgment,

• Initiative, accuracy, industry, productivity, knowledge of duties,

investigative abillty, development of informants and sources of

intormation and reporting ability, are of particular importance

in evaluating employee performance and must be

carefully con-

sidered in arriving at the adjective rating:

(5) There have been a number of instances in which

the ratings on the subelements on such items as investigative

ability, reporting ablllty, executive ability and ability on raids

:.

and dangerous assignments did not support the over-all rating

on the particular element. If an employee is to be rated

excellent on any one of these elements he must be rated excellent

or outstanding on the majority of the subelements or the nar

rative comments must clearly reflect the reason why the employee

Isconsidered excellent in the particular item. If an employee

Is to be rated outstanding on one of these elements he must be

rated outstanding on each of the subelements in which he is rated.

(6) In some instances the narrative comments were

not complete or the information

submitted was misleading.

this regard the Manual of Rules and Regulations specifically sets

out information which must be included and questions which must

be answered.

Rating officials who have followed the format and

answered

the questions outlined in the Manual have experienced

little difficulty in the preparation of performance ratings; how-

ever, those who erroneously assume a complete knowledge of the

regulations invariably submit

incomplete and inaccurate ratings.

Particular attention must be given to the specific comments

required on police incuructors; sound men, racident ugents,

accountants, language ability, disciplinary action and admini-

strative advancement to insure that complete and accurate

Information is set out. In regard to disciplinary action it

is imperative that the rating official set out each item of

administrative action, including

the date of the action and

the reason for it, and specifically note the items on the

• rating

guide and

check list which have been affected by the

action.

(7) If an employee is a relief supervisor and has

been used in this capacity during the rating period he should

be rated on item 21, executive ability, and if he has not been

used in this capacity during the rating period the narrative

comments should so indicate.

(8) In those cases in which there has been a

deterioration in the employee's performance or serious defi-

ciencies are noted it is the responsibility of the rating and

reviewing officials to submit a cover memorandum with the

rating

setting out recommendations for appropriate action.

(9) It is imperative that ratings be prepared in

sufficient time to reach the Bureau by the due date which is

reflected in the Manual.of Rules and Regulations and that a

rating be submitted on each employee when due. Performance

(E) . NATIONALIT I GROUP COVERAGE - CUBA -- The failure of the

recent invasio attempt by Cuban rebel forces has accentuated

the problem of investigating anti-Castro and

pro-Castro groups

and Individuals in the United States. In addition to dis-

charging our security and criminal responsibilities we are

faced

with the necessity of acquiring and providing lother

agencies informative and valid intelligence data relative to

the objectives and activities of both factions as well as data

regarding key personalities..

Key field offices handling Cuban

natters

have been instructed previously to give continuous and

preferred attention to all phases or Cuban activity.

In order to discharge these investigative and

intelligence responsibillties with maximum effectiveness it

is essential that particular attention be afforded the develop-

ment on a broadly expanded basis of sources and informants in

a position to provide knowledgeable data regarding pro-Castro

and anti-Castro activities.

The need for broadened coverage

in the anti-Castro field by the FBI is quite evident when it

1s recognized there is as yet no firm indication of the extent

of guidance and direction, if any, which will be afforded anti-

Castro activity in the United States by other agencies of the

U: S. Government. Any pertinent developments in this regard

will be brought promptly

your attention in order to assure

proper coordination.

(COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND DISRUPTION) - Your attention is

directed to SAC Letter 60-34(E) and SAC Letter 60-36 (H) which.

furnished instructions for handling a counterintelligence

program against the Soviet-bloc intelligence services aimed

at neutralizing or disrupting their activities.

During a conference held at the Bureau May 8 and 9,

1961, attended by representatives of 18 field offices which

handle the bulk of the Bureau's security work, It was noted

that this program of harassment and disruption has been suc-

cessful and the conference concluded that it should be continued

and, if possible, expanded in the future. It was noted

particularly that the Soviet-bloc Intelligence services are

very sensitive to adverse publicity and it was considered

desirable to foster such publicity wherever possible in the

future.

You should, therefore, continue to furnish to the

those instances where Soviet-bloc officials travel throughout

If any, be shown on the SI cards.

This matter was discussed at a recent Internal Security -

Espionage Conference held

at the Bureau and attended by repre-

sentatives of 16 field offices. It was the opinion of the ...

Conference that the listing of such information on the SI cards

would materially facilitate any future surveys that need be

conducted in connection with infiltration of subversives into..

: labor unions.

This matter should be handled as the cases are opened

for semiannual verification of residences and employments. If

It is determined that a subject is affiliated as either a

member or officer of a labor union, that information should be

set out on Form FD-122 under the heading, "Employment" and sub-

mitted to the Bureau in order that such may be added to the

SI cards.

volume of traffic at most crossing points along Mexican and

Canadian borders, requests to border offices to place stops should

be made only on a highly selective basis. Any exit stop placed

.with border officials must be placed with respective immigration

or custom officials of the Mexican or Canadian Government. At the

neavily traveled border crossing points, particularly on the Mexicar

border, very little control is exercised by these officials anc

Americans frequently are not stopped.

Mexican Tourist Cards are

required only for individuals bound

for the interior of Mexico,

Requests for exit stops snould be limited to important cases where

(F) CUBAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES - The

Castro regime has received a tremendous boost as a result of its

defeat of the anti-lastro forces during the recent invasion of

Cuba.

Castro's

prestige has risen not only among his followers

in this country but also throughout many of the Central and South

American countries.

His followers in the United States have

* nefited

prestigewise from his victory and as a result we have

'ad a resurgence of pro-Castro activities, particularly involving

One of the major problems in our Cuban work is that of

Intelligence activities. Heretofore Cuban Intelligence activities

In this country have been aimed primarily at the various

anti-

Castro groups.

The continued drift of cuba into the soviet orbit

the continued dependence of the Cuban Government upon Russia

and its satellite countries for economic and military assistance

could conceivably result in the undertaking by Cuban intelligence

of activities against the United States itself. We must be

prepared to meet any

such threat.

Perhaps the most effective means of fighting this cuban

intelligence problem is through good source, intormant and double

agent coverage.

Since the break in United States - Cuban relations

in January, 1961, we have been hampered to some degree by our loss

of special

coverage on Cuban diplomatic establishments in Miami,

New York and Washington, D. C. Other sources have compensated for.

this loss to some degree; however, we cannot fulfill our obligations

unless there is a continuing effort to develop new sources, informants

and

double agents who can keep us abreast of developments in the

Cuban intelligence field.

One phase of this coverage which warrants special mention

1s that of double agents.

There is a definite need for improvement

in this type coverage and the Bureau expects key offices involved

in Cuban work to lead the way in the development and utilization

of double agents.

The Bureau believes that the present time would

be ideal to infiltrate double agents into the pro-Castro ranks.

Individuals utilized could use approach that although they have

been anti-Castro in the past they are now disenchanted with the

leaders of the various anti-Castro groups; they do not agree with

the United States role in the recent invasion of Cuba by anti-castro

forces; and they now feel that Castro's policies are best for Cuba.

One special segment of present anti-Castro individuals who might be

utilized along these lines are those who have recently returned from

(ST) NIERNAZIONAT SERVICES OF INFORMATION FOUNDATION, INC.

The ISI, which has its headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland,

and an office in Elizabeth, New Jersey, was organized in 1946. It

1s headed by Ulius Louls Amoss, a former colonel in the Air Force.

A number of other former officers in various branches of the Armed

Forces of the United States are

listed as officers in ISI, and,

according to one official, former military officers are used to

solicit contributions to

finance the organization's activities.

These individuals reportedly are paid a 25 per cent commission on

all funds they collect.

ISI is a private intelligence agency which publishes a

-pamphlet entitled INFORM for distribution to its subscribers. Data

appearing in the pamphlet appears to be a rehash of old information

which has been given a sensational slant.

Amoss formerly was

connected with the Office of Strategic Services and Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA),,and the latter group has described him

"flop and fabricator."

Even though reports in the Criminal Intelligence Program

are disseminated only to the Department, there has been no change in

the instructions as to dissemination contained in part 2, section

of the Manual of Rules and

Dissemination to other

governmental agencies required under this manual section must be

handled on a timely basis and you should insure that all agents

are thoroughly familiar with this section of the manual. If any

Instances should arise where you consider dissemination inadvisable;

the Bureau should be promptly advised.

As you are aware, the Department of Justice has sought the

cooperation of other investigative agencies of the Federal government

in furtherance of the Attorney General's attack on organized crime. .

As a result, other agencies, particularly the Internal Revenue

Service, wilT be Investigating notorious hoodlums-and racketeers-who.-

are also being investigated under our Criminal Intelligence Program.

You will already have disseminated to Internal Revenue Service

information received indicating a possible tax violation on the part

of these subjects. If Internal Revenue Service or another Federal

Investigative agency seeks further information from you, there is no.

objection to your disseminating such information under the provisions

of the manual section previously referred to provided, of course,

such dissemination will in no way interfere with the Bureau's

Interests.

Where time is of the essence or where the information to

be disseminated is relatively simple, there is no objection to this

dissemination being made orally.

A proper record should be made in

your file covering such dissemination.

If, however, the material

1s voluminous, an appropriate dissemination memorandum shoula be

prepared in keeping with existing Instructions ánü copies of such

memoranda should be supplied-to the Bureau.

You will, of course,

recognize that as your investigation

progresses additional information which should be disseminated may

be developed. It would also appear that as you are advised by Internal

Revenue Service or another Federal investigative agency as to develop-

ments in Its investigation of a subject, information in your file not

previously disseminated may become sufficiently pertinent to warrant

further dissemination by you.

The Bureau is cooperating wholeheartedly with the. Attorney

General's drive on organized crime and to this end desires each

Special Agent in Charge to Insure that all information which should

be disseminated to another Federal investigative agency is promptly

forwarded to that agency in line with the manual instructions

previously cited.

exchange of ideas and a sounding board to resolve mutual problems.

Agents attending these conferences exhibited an excellent knowledge

of their subject matter, which enabled informative and stimulating

discussion of the activities of the organized hoodlum element in

this country. The free exchange of Ideas and investigative

te' iniques gained through experience in criminal intelligence

ma,ters proved beneficial to all in attendance.-

The following were some of the major areas covered in

• rese discussions:

TROPOSED LEGISLATION

Keen interest was evidenced in some of the provisions

of proposed legislation which would enable the Bureau to carry

current investigations to a logical prosecutive conclusion.

It

was emphasized that the Bureau must now lay necessary groundwork

in contemplation of the passage of proposed legislation in order

that we will be in a position to move swiftly and efficiently

-- when eur responsibilities in this field are extended through

broadening of our jurisđïôtiön.™…•

Proposed legislation to combat organized crime and

racketeering, now before Congress, comprises generally eight

proposals which will either create new legislation or extend

current legislation over which the Bureau has investigative

jurisdiction.

-

Proposed legislation covering Interstate and foreign

travel in support of racketeering enterprises would prohibit

travel in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of

distributing the proceeds of any unlawful activity; committing

any crime of violence to further any unlawful activity; or other-

wise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the

promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of any

unlawful activity.

any enterprise involving gambling, liquor, narcotics, or

prostitution offenses or extortion or bribery in violation of

Federal or state laws.

A proposed amendment to the Obstruction of Justice

statute would broaden this statute to make it a violation for

any. Individual by force, threats, or injury to endeavor to

Intimidate any person who had furnished information to, or from

whom Intormation had been sought, by any Investigative

of the United States. It would also make lt a violation to wilfully

furnish false and misleading information to any Investigative agency

of the government.

Proposed legislation covering the interstate use of wire

communications for wagering would make it unlawful to lease, furnish,

or maintain any wire communication facility with the intent

that it

be used for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of

bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest or

to knowingly use

such facility for any such purpose.

Proposed legislation covering the interstate transportation

of wagering paraphernalia would make it unlawful to transport inter-

state any record, ticket, certilicate, bill, slip, token, paper,

writing, or other paraphernalia designed for use in bookmaking or

wagering pools with respect to a sporting event or any numbers, .

policy, bolita, or similar illegal games.

A proposal compelling testimony in certain labor racket.

eering cases would compel a witness to testify and afford him

Immunity against self-incrimination regarding matters on which he

is compelled to testify in connection with the Hobbs Act (inter-

ference with interstate commerce by. extortion or robbery) and

Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act (bribes by employers

"to union

representatives).

proposed amendments to the Fugitive Felon Act would

broaden this statute to include all crimes punishable by death or

Imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under the laws of the

place, from which the fugitive flees.:

A proposed amendment to the Johnson-Preston Act, covering

Interstate Transportation of Gambling Devices, would enlarge the

description of gambling devices to include any machine or mechanical

device designed primarily for use in connection with gambling. This

proposal would also enlarge the category of persons to whom

registration and filing provisions apply; it would grant immunity

in specific instances to individuals involved in order to sécure

their testimony, and would extend the act to include transportation

in foreign commerce.

It is emphasized that the above provisions are strictly

In a proposal stage.

However,

a general knowledge of the contents

of these proposals should be of value in shaping your investigative

approach in this program.

BROADENING OUR INTELLIGENCE BASIS

It was concluded at these conferences that we must extend

our intelligence coverage through the various echelons in the

organized underworld to complement highly concentrated coverage

we have attained and are perfecting on the top leaders of organized

crime in this country. Our investigations have identified the top

men to date as falling generally in older age groups. When these

leaders are removed by prosecution, death, or normal underworld

attrition, it will be necessary to

be aware of the makeup of the

younger element who will replace them.

Our position, both from an

intelligence standpoint and in consideration of future prosecution,

will be greatly enhanced if we obtain this broader coverage of

hoodlum groups at various levels.

In view of the possibility of our jurisdiction being

extended to cover interstate gambling operations, it is also

important that we develop a well-rounded picture of the integral

functions of major gambling operations which would be of interest

under the Interstate Gambling Activities classification. This will

require that all offices are fully aware of the makeup, operational

detail, and control of large scale gambling operations. within their

making use of interstate wire communication facilities for

gambling purposes.

As previously pointed out, these investigations

will be aimed primarily at the top gamblers and hoodlums in control

of such operations, and we cannot under any circumstances conduct

investigation of a

• legitimate news service or other completely

legitimate communications firm.

Other special groups which should be designated for special

attention are labor racketeers who are influencing or controlling

labor unions, either directly or through intermediaries, and hoodlums

• who specialize in the domination of racket activities on the United

States water fronts.

'INFORMANTS AND CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES

It was generally agreed that the most productive and

valuable coverage achieved to daté in the Criminal Intelligence

Program has been through the establishment of highly confidential

sources in key locations.

Such sources have provided insight

• into the organized hoodlum element which was unavailable through

other means.

From results obtained to date, there can be no

question that such sources are invaluable and that our efforts

should be concentrated on the éstablishment.of additional comparable

sources in order to afford a more complete picture of the inner

workings and relationships of various hoodlum groups.

Experience has shown that the most completeland

intelligible information is obtained from a combination of highly

confidential sources and live Informants. Each operates as an

Invaluable adjunct to the other, as demonstrated by some of the

best criminal intelligence operations we have in existence in various

cities to date. Fragmentary Information obtained from a highly

confidential source, when interpreted and further identified through

•:11-placed live informants, has become meaningful and extremely

ignificant in our tracing of hoodlum-activities.-conversely

-solated bits of information initially furnished by live informants,

when fully exploited through the establishment of a highly confidential

source, have proven extremely valuable in filling in our picture of

underworld activities.

For these reasons, the importance of both of these types

of sources cannot be overemphasized, and every effort shouldibe made

to improve our coverage in both areas:

With regard to the development of new live informants,

you should be constantly alert and ready to fully exploit any

opportunity offered to develop as informants highly placed members

of the organized hoodlum element. It is recognized that the

development of such all Individual may result in unusual conditions

or requests being presented by the potential informant. Such

situations should be evaluated in proportion to the individual's

potential value in this program, and the possibility of developing

a live source on an upper level of the organized hoodlum element

should not be dismissed arbitrarily.

COORDINATION OF INFORMATION OFFERING PROSECUTIVE POTENTIAL

AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Among topics of primary importance discussed at these

conferences was the goal whereby our criminal intelligence Investi-

gations will reach their culmination in successful prosecution of

the leaders of organized crime.

It is of paramount importance to

understand that our current investigations must be coordinated and

reported in such a way to provide the Department with necessary

bases for prosecution. All information developed which may offer

potential violations of statutes covered by other agencies should

be promptly disseminated in keeping with existing instructions.

Additionally, we must insure that our investigations are intelligently

planned and sufficiently thorough that we will develop any possible

violation of Federal law over which this Bureau has investigative

jurisdiction. We must also be prepared to take full advantage. of

any new legislation which would provide the Bureau with extended

jurisdiction to effectively combat the organized hoodlum element.

HOODLUM ACCOUNTS IN SWISS BANKS

The problem of tracing hoodlum funds was discussed and

it was determined that information has been developed in a number

of offices that top hoodlums are using numbered accounts in Swiss

banks to maintain concealed cash reserves. Extreme difficulty

has been experienced in developing full information concerning such

accounts because of swiss laws-guaranteeing. the secrecy of these

accounts.

In such instances, where it appears that a subject 1s

dealing with foreign banking institutions, investigation should be

conducted at correspondent banks in this country to determine if

records of pertinent transactions may be available at the

correspondent bank.

THUMBNAIL SKETCHES

Discussion concerning the availability of a ready

reference on hoodlums under investigation made it apparent that

there is a need to maintain in each office a brief sketch on all

hoodlum subjects under investigation throughout the Bureau.

This

Investigative aid would list an up-to-date description, allases,

criminal associates, und othor descriptive datu, together with a

brief documentation of the hoodlum.

This sketch would be valuable

In coordinating hoodlum investigation between field offices and in

the preparation of reports. You will be advised in the near future

of the mechanics of maintaining this Bureau-wide list of hoodlums

under investigation.

It was also concluded during these discussions that all

organized hoodlum element will be referred

use of the caption "Top Hoodlum Program" in communications on

these matters should be discontinued.

This series of conferences demonstrated that our

Criminal Intelligence Program has to date developed excellent

coverage of the upper level organized criminal element in

specific areas, and that this desired coverage must be extended

throughout the country. This must be done to insure that the

• Bureau has a continuing broad and comprehensive picture of the

activities of the organized hoodlum element in the United States.

RE: COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

'PROSECUTIONS UNDER THE

• ¿INTERNAL SECURITY ACT OF 1950

On June 5, 1961, the United States Supreme Court upheld

the constitutionality of the registration provision of the Internal

Security

Act of 1950 and ordered the Communist Party, USA, to

register with the Attorney General as a communist-action organization.

In view of the definite possibility of prosecutive action against

the Party and against selected Party officers and memoers should

they fall to register as ordered, the Bureau desires to reiterate

and

enlarge upon instructions previously Issued in No Number SAC

Letter J dated October 19, 1951, captioned "Communist Party - USA

(Brief), Prosecution of Communist Party Functionaries under the

Snath Act.

Since it is a cardinal rule of evidence that conversations

between a subject and his attorney are in the nature of privileged

• communications, technical and microphone surveillances in operation

on Communist Party functionaries arrested for violation of the

Smith Act of 1940 were discontinued immediately following such

arrests.

Notwithstanding this fact, the possibility was recognized

that occasions might arise when conversations between subjects and

their attorneys, or between the attorneys themselves, might be

Intercepted by technical or microphone surveillances which continued

In operation on unrelated individuals and/or organizations.

Accordingly, the field was instructed In referenced No

• Number SAC Letter I that should such conversations occur, they were

Numbe comp

to be completely disregarded by the employees assigned to technical

and microphone surveillance coverage.

Such conversations were not to

be monitored and no record whatever was to be made of their occurrence.

While it 1s true that the Department has not as yet

furnished the identitles of those Party officers or members who will

be prosecuted should they fail to register, the Supreme Court

decision 1s being widely discussed In Party circles and It is

possible that Party leaders and/or members may be in communication

with attorneys regarding defense plans and strategy on the possibility

Indiciment might be returned against the Party as an organization

as againes themselves as individuals.

Therefore, the instructions

Ict out in No Number SAC Letter J are being reiterated and emphasized

2.

Receipts reflecting payment to informant should clearly

reflect the date of payments purpose, that is, whether for

services.or expenses or both and

the

amount for each. The

period covered should be shown when the informant is paid

on a period basis and the name of the Special Agent from

whom the money was received.

The receipt must be signed

by the informant receiving the money and should not be

witnessed by another Agent.

-

3. If necessary to make corrections on the receipts, such

corrections must be initialed by the informant and not the

Informants should reflect date of payment, Bureau case title,

date of the authorization under which the payment was made,

period covered and purpose of payment.

2.

The first blue slips submitted in connection with a

payment to an informant who has previously been used by

another field division should reflect the identity of

KIDNAPING AND MAJOR CASES

DUTIES OF #1 MAN

The #1 Man is the immediate assistant to the Inspector

or person in charge of the case and serves in the capacity of executive

officer, taking whatever action is necessary to implement the instructions

of the Inspector.

In the absence of the Inspector or official in charge, the

#1 Man is to supervise and be in charge of the entire investigation. To

carry out this responsibility there must be a close working arrangement

between the Inspector and the #1 Man so that both are fully informed at

all times.

Generally the Inspector should see everything coming

in on the case, including memos, letters and other communications,

while outgoing communications can usually be handled by the #1 Man.

Of course, any outgoing communication of importance or unusual

significance would be brought to the Inspector's attention. In addition,

the #1 Man reviews all incoming material prior to the assignment of

leads and preparation of lead cards so that he has a complete knowledge

of all the facts in the case and the action being taken to develop further

information.

the proper handling of the case. In this regard it probably will be

necessary for the #1 Man to confer with the personnel in key positions

to insure they understand their duties and to clarify any particular

problems or procedures. Thereafter, the #1 Man should immediately

review all pertinent developments in the case so he will have complete

information concerning the developments to date and be in a position to

carry out his responsibilities.

REPORT WRITING

The work of a report writer on a special assignment falls

into three general categories:

1. Assembling and preparing reports on the case.

2. Preparation of a daily teletype summary to the Bureau.

3. Other special projects assigned by the Inspector or

Agent in charge of the case.

I. REPORT WRITING

Generally speaking, reporting investigation conducted by a

special squad follows the reporting procedures set forth in the Manual

for other cases. However, there are certain suggestions which can

be followed which will facilitate the report writing.

-——.

I. Do not wait to write long reports on a variety of

subjects. It makes for better reports and is easier for reference

purposes to limit each report to one phase of the investigation or

even a part of one phase. For instance, the first report in a

• kidnaping case might well cover the predication and initial

investigation, another report cover the investigation at the crime

scene, another on the background of the victim and family, another

on miscellaneous suspects and other reports on various phases of the

investigation as they develop. It is probable that near the end of

the investigation, as the case begins to come to a close, reports

will be written covering a variety of subjects.

NW 55044Đ00Id:32989526 Page_880

---

## Page 881

2. Even though it may seem unnecessary at the

beginning, a table of content. for each report will prove helpful.

The more that the table of contents is set out in detail, the

more helpful it will be.

3. Because of the manner in which leads are assigned,

it is unnecessary and actually of no use to set out leads in reports

written while the case is being handled by the special squad. A

short statement that leads are not being set out but are being

assigned and handled as developed should appear in the administrative

section of each report.

4.. Dissemination

of copies of reports to other offices

will depend on the circumstances of each case. If the case appears

to have nation-wide ramifications, it would be well to send one

copy of each report containing the basic facts to each office so

that it will not be necessary to repeat this information as later

leads are set out by teletype or airtel. In some cases, this

dissemination can be limited to offices in the general area of the

country surrounding the office of origin. In any event, it is not

necessary to provide widespread dissemination of later reports

dealing with specific projects as the investigation progresses.

Copies of these reports can be limited to offices which are known

to have an interest in that particular phase of the investigation.

2

LNW 55044 DecId:32989526

Page 881

---

## Page 882

5. Leads for other offices will usually be set out by

telephone, teletype, airtel or letter. While other offices should

be expected to advise the results of their investigation by a

similar communication, they should also be instructed to report

the results of their investigation in regular report form. It

would be a mistake to allow auxiliary offices to RUC investigation

by letter or airtel since the office of origin would soon become

bogged down in paper work.

6. The office of origin should have additional copies of

each report run off for working copies. These can be bound in file

covers by the clerks and made readily available to agents on the

--..

squad without the necessity of having to charge out a file each time

it is necessary to refer to a report. They will also be available

for squad members to read in their spare time, if any, in order to

familiarize themselves with the case. These working copies should

be accounted for and destroyed when the special terminates. The

number of working copies prepared will depend on the size of the

special squad. Four copies have been found to be sufficient for

a squad of from twenty-five to thirty-tive men.

•7. Usually considerable work will have been performed

by the office of origin before the special squad arrives. In order

that reporting will be uniform and prepared properly, the report

• writer should prepare a memo of reporting instructions to be

' - 3-

I ww. 55044 DocId: 32989526

## Page 883

distributed to all agents and stenos imnediately upon his arrival.

These instructions should be discussed verbally at the first

available conference of agents and should also be discussed verbally

with stenographers in order that any misunderstandings can be

clarified.

These instructions should include the following items:

_Interviewsand. other_investigation.conducted

which can

reasonably be expected to be used as testimony should be

reported on an FD-302. In many cases, there has developed a

tendency to use an FD-302 in situations where there is only a

possibility of the information being used as testimony. This

clutiers up the report with a series of disjointed short items.

Exercise judgment in the use of an FD-302 and do not use it

indiscriminately.

b. Investigation conducted which does not go on

an FD-302 should be reported on a narrative type insert. It is well

to begin the insert with a short explanatory statement as to the

basis for the investigation conducted. For instance: "John Jones,

312 Main Street, Los Angeles, California, was interviewed by SA

Thomas Smith, inasmuch as Jones' name had been found on a piece of

paper in possession of subject's wife." This not only makes the

report clearer but is also of assistance to the report writer in

preparation of the report.

C. Each narrative type insert should be limited

to one subject matter, since as mentioned above, reports will

usually be written about one phase of the investigation and each

• 4

NW 55044 Doold: 32989526

Page 863

---

## Page 884

report will be broken down into logical sections. The insert should

be dictated in a form suitable to go into a report without change

or deletion. Do not include administrative matters, etc.

d. All FD-302s and narrative inserts should be

prepared on stencils. The steno should be instructed to make two

proof sheets since it is sometimes necessary in complicated matters

to hand one proof sheet to an agent for assistance in covering leads

suggested by the insert. White proof sheets are easier to read than

yellow sheets.

-

€. A 3 x 5 card should be attached to each FD-302

or insert which has on it the particular project or phase of the

investigation to which it applies. This assists the report writer

in segregating the stencils into appropriate sections of the report.

f. Each agent should dictate any leads suggested

by the insert or FD-302 he is submitting. These should be narrative

type lead cards in triplicate with a short statement similar to an

abstract, showing the predication for the lead. See memo on setting

up Chief Clerk's Office for example of this type of lead.

go Each agent should indicate to the steno all

names, license numbers, serial numbers or any other data which

should be indexed and instruct the steno to prepare index cards

in duplicate.

8 Complaints received, suggestions, administrative

matters and other similar data which cannot go into a report

"verbatim should be dictated in memorandum form. The number of copies

will depend upon the way the case is set up administratively,

-5 -

i NW. 55044: DocId: 32989526

Page 884

---

## Page 885

bearing in m nd that in many cases a copy of the

memorandum will

be necessary for a subfile. Therefore, a minimum of original and

two copies.

9. As FD-302s, inserts and memoranda are typed they

should be delivered to the Inspector in charge or SAC immediately.

He and the number one man will read them and pass them on to the

lead supervisor who will remove and handle the lead cards. The

Inspector in charge or the lead supervisor will mark memoranda for

routing and they will go to the Chief Clerk for serializing and

routing.. Stencil FD-302s and narrative type inserts go from the

lead supervisor to the report writer.

The report writer should

then segregate them as to subject matter and use in the preparation

of the report. It will be recalled that there will be a duplicate

set of index cards attached

to each stencil. Undoubtedly there

will be considerable information in the stencils which should be

in the special indices in order to be of use. In order to solve

this problem, the report writer will remove one set of index

cards and turn them over to the Chief Clerk. These will be

"red flashed" by making a small red pencil mark where the serial

number would ordinarily appear. This index card will then be filed

in the special indices. An agent seeing a "red flash" index

card with no serial number will then know that the material indexed

is on a stencil in possession of the report writer and can refer

to it there. When a report is prepared, the appropriate "red flash"

- 6 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 885

---

## Page 886

index cards are marked with the serial and page number.

The

other set of index cards which had been attached

to the stencil

is similarly marked and placed in the regular office indices at that

time. In other words, in the interval between when a stencil is

prepared and when it finally is incorporated into a report, there

is an index card in the special indices with the special red

marking so that all data

submitted by the Agents is indexed at all

times with no time lapse.

II. DAILY TELETYPE SUMMARY

A teletype should be sent to the Bureau each night

summarizing developments which have occurred during the day. This

is necessary even though the Bureau might have been informed by

telephone of developments. This procedure should be followed until

the Bureau instructs to the contrary. The report writer should

make notes during the day of developments which should be included

in this teletype and each night should confer with the Inspector

in charge prior to preparing the summary.

III. SPECIAL PROJECTS

The report writer is responsible for various "paper work"'

projects and research which become necessary in a case and which

are usually assigned by the Inspector in charge. Examples of such

projects which have been necessary in some cases are as follows:

1. Memorandum to all Agents outlining certain phases of

the case with which they should be acquainted such as description

property in possession of the victin,

explanation of the basis

LNW 55044_ DocId: 32989526

Page 886

---

## Page 887

or various investigative projects being conducted and similar

memoranda.

2o Communications to all offices or selected offices

outlining investigative projects desired and the basis for them:

3. Special research and file review projects desired by

the Inspector in charge. As an example, in one case an analysis

was made of the financial status of subject at the time of the

crime based on past earnings and expenses. In another case a

chart was prepared of the whereabouts of all subjects for the

pertinent period of one week for assistance in interviews and

checking their stories.

4o When the subject is identified, plans should be

made for the preparation of a prosecutive summary report. : It-will

assist in the preparation of the report if the report writer keeps

a rough draft compilation of evidence developed and the names of

potential witnesses so that when the time comes for the preparation

of the report much of the data will be available in outline form.

Summary reports are often required with a minimum of notice and

this procedure will assist in expediting the preparation.

PREPARATION OF RANSOM LIST

IN KIDNAPING CASES

INTRODUCTION

intended to be all inclusive but to be considered

as a supplement to well-established procedures

- currently outlined in. the Manual of Instructions.

OBTAINING FUNDS NEEDED

With the apparent ever-increasing amount of ransom meney

being demanded which is usually in currency of small denominations and

in consideration of the limited time element presented under the twenty-four

hour presumptive clause, and further, in consideration that the Subject may

make a payoff request within a very few days after the abduction, it has

become increasingly clear that obtaining funds in the quantity and type needed

for the best interest of the investigation is a major problem of paramount

importance.

Consistent with suitable banking arrangements available

- and/or desirable to the victim's family and the Bureau case and depending

on the amount and type of currency needed, an early conference with a

member of the family and/or their banking representative should be held

to determine identities of persons who are responsible on the family side

for preparation of the ransom money and whether the proper type of currency

is readily available in amounts needed.

If not, immediate steps should be taken to obtain such money;

it being sometimes necessary to obtain funds from other Federal Reserve

Districts. Here, working directly with a Federal Reserve Bank can be very

advantageous. If it is necessary to sort a large volume of currency to insure

that all bills are of particular denomination of the ransom money or of the

same type and series, much more currency than the amount specified in the

ransom demand will be needed.

5 .

For istance, in a recent case three million dollars in bills

of ten and twenty dollar denominations were assembled and sorted to obtain

therefrom the necessary five hundred thousand dollar ransom.

Here, the

expert staff of currency sorters employed in a Federal Reserve Bank were

• st only extremely helpful but necessary and in a situation of this kind are

of inestimable value.

Such a conference as indicated above will often be valuable

in conveying to the family and its bankers an appreciation of the investigation

and evidentiary problems arising in these cases and avoids such instances

as recently occurred where a family banking representative thought that

just to fill a suitcase with currency of the denomination and total amount

demanded would be all that is necessary.

It was found in one recent case where the ransom demarded

was five hundred thousand dollars in ten and twenty dollar bills that the

local bank, although quite a sizable institution, could not supply these

funds, let alone in bills of the same Federal Reserve District as is some-

times desirable. Neither could the local Federal Reserve Bank of this

district supply the necessary funds of the type reeded.

Calls to other Federal Reserve Banks determined they had

no such amounts on hand of the same series or type.

Finally, to assemble the required amounts in ten and twenty

dollar denominations, the local Federal Reserve Bank had to obtain funds

- 2 -

Page 390

## Page 891

.

from another unit of the Federal Reserve System totaling some one and

one-half million dollars which, when combined with a like amount on hand,

provided the sorting staff with sufficient currency to make up the ransom

amount in bills of the desired type.

Here, the cooperation between Federal Reserve Banks

enabled the delivery by plane of the requested amount from a city some

seven hundred miles distant in a matter of approximately four and one-

half hours.

PHOTOGRAPHING THE RANSOM MONEY

It is believed experience has shown that automatic feed

Recordak equipment of a type having an odometer counter and which will

handle paper of the texture of used currency, is most satisfactory for

photographing the ransom currency. The counter provides a check of the

number of bills photographed in a given package and will provide an alert

if there is an inaccurate count.

It is considered absolutely necessary that, as soon as it is

determined, the preparation of a ransom and a ransom list may be or is

necessary, steps be taken through the nearest Recordak representative to

make one or more of these machines available for installation at a

suitable scene of operations, preferably away from either the Bureau Field

Office or any temporary Bureau headquarters set up on the case. A

suitable location may be found in the vault or other isolated section of the

## Page 892

bank through whic. the ransom money is being prepared. In this

connection and in the interest of security and secrecy, a Federal Reserve

Bank, if one is in the vicinity, may offer the best advantages from several

standpoints, namely:

1) If a large sum must be assembled of a certain-kind-of-

currency, it would probably not be on hand at any one

private banking institution and may have to be obtained through the Federal

Reserve Bank.

• 2) Banking connections of prominent families are usually

known to many bank employees and may be known to

the press. These individuals may exhibit an interest in the ransom

money preparation which could possibly be detrimental to the investigation

and which could probably be avoided if a Federal Reserve Bank is used. -

3) In all probability considerable night work will be

necessary for several dozen persors. They can be

assembled at a Federal Reserve Bank without arousing the curiosity of

outsiders more effectively than at a private bank, particularly where it is

known the family has its banking interests.

The mere obtaining and installation of the proper type of

recording equipment does not insure a successful photographic operation.

The mechanical adjustments on the machine, particularly the feeding

mechanism where used currency is the subject material, is very critical.

-

4 -

• NW. 55044* DoG1d432939526

Pager 892-

---

## Page 893

Te Recordak representative should effect these adjustments,

photograph a trial number of bills which should be processed immediately

to insure proper operation.

In this connection and in the actual operation of photographing

the ransom money, attention is invited to instructions set forth in the

Manual of Instructions concerning the obtaining of a clearance from the

United States Secret Service before photographing money.

The Recordak representative should also provide training

and instructions to the individuals who will operate the equipment on the

loading, changing and removal of film reels. These photographers or

operators should be banking employees working under the guidance of

Bureau agents.

Exposed film should be identified as follows:

1) Before photographing each package of one hundred bills,

a photo of a 3 x 5 card should be taken on which is

clearly shown the name of the bank employee, photographer, date and

identity of the case.

2) Each reel of film sent to the FBI Laboratory, whether

developed or me rely exposed, should be handled by Agents

as evidence. If the film is only exposed this should be plainly indicated

on the package containing this particular reel to avoid accidental

exposure because there may not be another opportunity to photograph

this portion of the money again.

- 5

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 893

---

## Page 894

It is suggested that if facilities are at all available for

developing the Recordak film locally that exposed film be immediately

processed for the following reasons:

• 1) Will insure that photographing equipment if functioning

properly during the operation.

2) That operators are efficient.

3) Will provide immediate opportunity for scanning results

in a viewer for partially or completely superimposed

bills, which when photographed were in such position as

to obscure portions of or all of the identifying currency

serial numbers.

Further, it will also indicate instances

where for some reason or other, the bill happened to

be photographed face down, thereby obscuring identifying

characteristics.

4) Where superimposition is discovered it permits

rephotography of that group of one hundred bills which

should be done rather than trying to photograph only

the bills involved.

Photographing. of the face of the ransom currency should

begin at the earliest possible time and not delayed for the handlisting of

the bills. In fact, a bundle of one hundred bills can be photographed in

seconds, thus permitting the hand listing to begin virtually simultanecusly.

- 6 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 894

---

## Page 895

.

It should be borne in mind that, in the event of an early,

unexpected or premature demand for the ransom payoff is made, that

the photographic record of the money would be better than none or even

better than a partial handwritten list.

-If photography is the only record available and-it is-done

with the insertion on the film of proper identifying cards with each package

of one hundred bills such film could be used for identifying the ransom

money at a later time and conceivably as evidence in court.

HAND LISTING OF BILLS

In addition to the instructions set forth in the Manual the

following is offered:

A lined tablet sheet of approximately legal size and having

thirty-three or more lined spaces is suitable for preparing the handwritten

list of bills and is usually readily available in most banking institutions

or at local stationery stores.

The top margin of this sheet can be used for identifying

data and by drawing two vertical lines down through the lined spaces,

the sheet can be divided into three columns, each with thirty-three lined

spaces for recording bill serial numbers. This gives spaces for ninety-

nine bills of the one hundred bill package.

LNV 55044-DocId:32989526 Page 895

---

## Page 896

At he head or top of the third column the vertical line

dividing columns two and three should be extended upward a distance of a

lined space and then to the right to the edge of the page. This will be

the space on which the serial number of the sixty-seventh bill of the

package will be entered thereby keeping the bills listed in the order making

up the package.

!

The reason this is suggested is that it provides an

instantaneous visual check to insure that:

1) The particular package has ene hundred bills in it and:

2) That all one hundred have been handlisted. In a recent

case where currency was shipped from an auxiliary bank

and some thirty thousand bills prepared, some of the currency had a musty

odor and was somewhat damp to the touch. Apparently it had been stored

in a damp place.

Some of this money was not usable because the Recordak machine

would not handle it properly in this condition.

In photographing that portion of the money which could be used

and apparently due to some dampness, two of the bills were superimposed

so perfectly that only the upper one was photographed and the bank employee

doing the photography did not check the odemeter count or possibly did

not have it properly reset so that the fact that only ninety-nine bills were

photographed in that package came to his attention.

* /hen this package of bills was handlisted the bills were

apparently still together since the page on which the package was listed

contained only ninety-nine serial numbers. This was not immediately

noted and when the lists and films were sent to the Bureau for the

-preparation of the ransom-list-it was-discovered one bill-was-missing.

Since the ransom was not paid in this case, the money was

returned to the bank several months later and meanwhile apparently dried out.

The package having the handlisting of only ninety-nine bills

was examined and found to actually contain one hundred bills.

If the pages for the handwritten list had had one extra space

as above described or some other simple method of assuring a proper

count had been used it is believed this missing bill would have been

found and listed due to the simple visual check made possible by the

-

system outlined.

If a sheet is used having more than thirty-four lined spaces

it is suggested the same easy check can be effected by drawing a line

horizontally across the first and second columns thirty-three spaces down

and then a line across the third column thirty-four spaces down.

MISCELLANEOUS

)

If possible, the photographing and handlisting of the various

packages of currency should follow the same sequence to aid the data processing

section of the Bureau in locating errors or questionable entries.

This may not be one hundred per cent possible because instances

will occur when it will be necessary to re-run a package of bills through the

Recordak machine some time after they were originally photographed and after

other packages had been exposed.

For instance, when proof viewing, if this is possible, some

superimposed currency may be noted necessitating that particular package of bills

be photographed again. As of possible aid to the data processing section in

reconciling possible errors and discrepancies, the following is suggested:

The 3 x 5 card bearing the identifying data as to file number,

date, name of photographing bank employee, etc., will be photographed at the

beginning of each "bundle" of ten packages of currency and also photographed

again before each package of bills are photographed.

This card could have, say in the left lower corner, the Roman

numeral I followed by a small Arabic numeral 1 and photographed prior to the

running of the first package of one hundred bills. For the second package

of one hundred bills the Arabic figure 2 would be added after the Arabic numeral

1 and this same procedure followed on up through the tenth package of bills.

The card would then be placed on the face of package one which

would be the top package of a bundle of ten packages which would then be assigned

for handlisting.

- 10 -

NN 35044 Doord: 32989526-Page-998

---

## Page 899

The ten packages of this bundle could then be identified on the

particular sheet on which these particular bills are handlisted by merely

entering the package number on the sheet.

For the second bundle of ten packages the Roman numeral

II would be used and the Arabic system 1 through 10 repeated.

This system could also be repeated for each denomination of

bills processed.

-

Care should be taken that the 3 x 5 cards are not included with

the ransom money when it is finally assembled. Cards should be removed

at the time the handlisting operation occurs and not replaced on the bundles.

A simple control system should be set up to insure that all cards are

retrieved before the ransom money is packaged.

In a recent case where time was limited and in order to be

certain the photography was beng properly handled, exposed film was processed

immediately after exposure by the local Recordak agency. Since there was

the possibility all handwritten lists would not be cempleted before a pay-off

demand came, in which case it was conceivable the film might be the only

evidentiary record of the money, the film was escorted through the

Recordak processing laboratory by the bank employee who did the

photography and who could appear as a competent witness if need be.

It is suggested that after the photography and preparation of

the handwritten list has been in progress for say, three hours, a check be

made to determine the amount of work accomplished which would then

- 11 -

NW 55044 DooId: 32989526

Page 899

---

## Page 900

give an estimate of approximately when completion of the ransom nonej

processing could be expected. This check could be made repeatedly

throughout the operation insofar as is considered necessary and would

serve as a barometer by which it could be told whether or not more

employees and machines are needed. It also will provide information

which can be furnished the Bureau as to about when it could expect to

receive the films and handwritten lists.

TECHNICAL INSTALLATIONS

_ IN VICTIM'S HOME

The victim's residence was served by a private telephone

line which traveled underground from the road to the residence,.

entering the residence in a crawl space located underneath the

bedroom areas of the house. There were four extension telephones,

one in victim's wile's bedroom, one in the bedroon occupied by

victim's two daughters, one in the kitchen and one in the basement

recreation room.

Prior to the Bureau's officially entering the investigation

01 February. 10, 1960, to deputies from the Jefferson County Sheriff's

Office had been assigned to the victim's residence by the Jefferson

County Sheriff. These deputies had connected a recorder to the

telephone extension located in the basement recreation room by

taping the microphone of the recorder to the ear piece of the

telephone handset. Arrangements had been made with the person

designated to answer the telephone to pick up the handset of the

upstairs extension at the end of the third ring, at which time one

of the deputies would turn the recorder on and lift the receiver

of the recreation room'extension telephone.

The sound-trained Agent went to victim's residence on the

evening of February 10, 1960. A 1948 Ford panel truck was used to

take this Agent and the equipment to victim's residence.. The

following was the equipment taken:

1.

Western Electric 500 C/D telephone instrument with

Audio Development Co. transformer #114A.

NW 55044 Docid:32989526- Page-901

## Page 902

2. Two Magnecord PT 6 amplifiers and four Transport units.

3. Two Magnecord transfer switches.

4. One Magnecord voice-operated relay.

5. FM radio dispatcher unit.

6.- Lineman's test set.

7. Supply of magnetic recording tape.

8. 100 foot spool of two-conductor wire.

9. Tool box with flashlight, tools, tape and miscellaneous

items.

10. Mile Ray light.

• Due to the layout of victim's residence and due to the

fact that victim's wife and four children had friends coming to the

residence to visit them, the kidnap telephone installation was made

in the basement recreation room in place of the extension telephone

located there. This area of the house was the only place Agents

could remain out of sight of visitors visiting members of victim's

family. Making the installation in this room made it necessary for

the person designated to answer the telephone, one of the victim's

brothers or the brother of victim's wife, to come down to the

basement recreation room to answer the telephone when it rang. The

other three extension

telephones were disconnected in the terminal

block located in the crawl space under the house. This was done to

prevent anyone from picking up the handset of one of the telephone

extensions located on the main floor of the house while a telephone

call was being received on the kidnap telephone installation, thus

causing a disturbance.on the

line.

Foll wing discussion with victim's wife

regarding the plans

for the famil: during the time the victim was missing, victim's wife

made arrangements for the children to live elsewhere and she

discouraged most of her friends from making visits

to her residence.

This provided more security for the Agents and the fecording equipment

at victim's residence. The kidnap telephone instrument was then

moved to victim's wife's bedroom where one Agent remained on duty

at all times, along with the person designated to answer the telephone

The victim's wife's bedroom, in which the kidnap telephone

installation was made, was located about 90 feet away from the

recreation

area at the far end of the house. It was connected to

the Magnecord recording equipment in the recreation room and this

was accomplished by running a two-conductor wire from the "Bridge In"

of the Magnecord amplifier in the recreation room through the furnace

room and through the crawl space under the house to victim's wife's

bedroom. The wire was routed into the room through the hole in the

floor used by the Telephone Company in the original installation of

the telephone extension located in this room and was connected to

the transformer attached to the Western Electric 500 telephone

instrument. A connection was made from the ground terminal of the

transformer to a nearby electrical outlet box. A lineman's test

set was connected to the red and green terminals of the telephone

connecting block along with the kidnap telephone instrument. The

switch on the lineman's test set was taped to prevent it from

being switched from the monitor position which would have permitted

the feeding of extraneous noises on the line. This test set was used

by the Agent on duty in this room to listen in on the calls while

they were being received and permitted him to give the proper

prearranged signals to the person receiving the call.

A Magnecord amplifier and two Transport units with a trans-

fer switch and a voice-operated relay were used in this recording

of the telephone calls. Another Magnecord amplifier and two Transpor

units were set up next to the ones being used for the recording and

a connection made from the "Bridge In" of the Magnecord amplifier in

use to the "Bridge In" of the Magnecord amplifier maintained as a

stand-by. In the event a failure had occurred in the Magnecord

amplifier while a call was being recorded, the recording operation

could have been continued by switching the motor-control switch

of the Magnecord Transport unit set up as a stand-by to the

"forward position."

A direct, private, unlisted and nonpublished line had been

installed which permitted Agents at victim's residence to communicate

• directly with Headquarters Office. The instrument at victim's

residence was located in the basement recreation room and the

instrument at Headquarters Office was located on the desk of the

Special Agent in Charge of the Special. When the handset of either

of these instruments was removed from the cradle, the other

Instrument would ring. This arrangement permitted rapid, direct

communication between victim's residence and the Headquarters Office,

call at victim's residence while it was being recorded by holding

the handset of the telephone instrument, connected to the direct

line, near the speaker of the Magnecord amplifier.

When a telephone call was received at victim's residence

the SAC of the Special or the person designated to remain in charge

in his absence was notified by use of the direct line to have the

Telephone Company continue the tracing of the call or to discontinue

the tracing operation, depending upon the identity of the caller.

Locating the recording equipment in the basement recreation

room away from the main living area provided security for the

recording operation and for the Agent operating the equipment when

visitors came to victim's residence. At the same time, the Agent

operating the equipment could provide security for the ransom

package containing the $500,000 which had been placed in a basement

storeroom near the recreation room.

An FM radio dispatcher unit was set up in the basement

recreation room for the purpose of communicating with Headquarters

Office or with Bureau automobiles, should the occasion arise. This

unit was also utilized to test the concealed radio units in the

automobile that was to be used by a person handling the ransom

package. Radio installations had been made in this car and this

car was stored in victim's residence garage and the radio equipment

was tested every 24 hours by the sound-trained Agent on duty at

victim's residence.

LABORATORY EXPERT ON THE MAJOR CASE SQUAD

The

Laboratory expert's primary function on a Major

Case squad is that of technical advisor and consultant to the

Inspector in Charge of the squad and the #l Man on the one side,

and the investigating agents on the other. It is his duty to

assist in resolving any problems relating to physical evidence

collected during the course of the investigation.. The basic

responsibilities of a laboratory experton a Major Case squad

are as follows:

lo Be available to answer any questions arising with

regard to proper handling of physical evidence.

Po Supervise packing and shipment of physical

Evidence to the Laboratory for examination.

3. Conduct preliminary examination of physical

evidence with the purpose of eliminating useless

requests of the laboratory and furnish the

investigating agents with the results of

preliminary examinations for investigative

guidance.

1o Dictate inserts on Laboratory matters.

5. Dictate leads arising as a result of collection

and/or examination of physical evidence.

6. Periodically, review the subsection of the case

file entitled "Laboratory Matters" in order to

be certain that all leads which may have arisen

front laboratory examinations have been dictated

and are being covered by the investigating

agents. In this connection, it is also the

responsibility of the Laboratory expert to see

that the subsection of the case file entitled

"Laboratory Matters" is up to date and current

at all times..

" Organizing and supervising projects arising as

the result of location of physical evidence. For

example, furnishing technical instruction to an

investigating. agent to assist him in obtaining

handwriting and typewriting specimens and in

eliminating typewriters obviously different from

that used in preparing a questioned ransom letter

in a kidnaping case.

8. Preparing or supervising preparation of exhibits,

by the investigating agents in the search for

significant handuriting, typeuriting, et cetera.

9. Conferring with the Inspector in Charge and #1 Man

of the Major Case squad regarding all Laboratory

matters in order that they may have the benefit

of any suggestions for projects or other investigations

which should be conducted or considered based on

Laboratory findings or collection of physical

evidence. For example, the laboratory expert mays

any photographic or copying work which may be

necessary.

12. In connection with kidnaping cases, to handle

all extortion and crank letters which may be

directed to the victim and see that they are

properly identified, photocopied and forwarded

to the Laboratory for examination.

13. Perform any other duties which are requested by

Inspector in Charge and #1 Man in so far as

primary responsibilities permit. The Inspector

to prope 'ly perform his duties pertaining to

Laboratory aspects of the case.

the

As can be seen from the list of responsibilities of the

Laboratory expert set forth above, any Laboratory man assigned

to

Major case squad should be well-rounded in all phases of the-

aboratory's work in order that he can properly handle his

esponsibilities. When a Laboratory man is assigned to a lajor

Case squad and prior to his departure from the Laboratory in

Hashington, he should confer with the various section and unit

chiefs of the laboratory at the Bureau regarding any technical

activity which he may encounter in the field. He should also

carefully check the list of equipment-and supplies which will be

necessary for him to take with him on his assignment to the field.

No set list of materials can be arbitrarily drawn up; such a list-

depends entirely on the case in question, the availability of

facilities in the field, and the availability of technical

eguipment in the field.

Upon arrival in the field on a lajor Case squad, the

Laboratory expert should, if possible, arrange for suitable

working space, so arranged that his technical equipment is readily

available and working conditions are such that a minimum of

distraction is present.

The above obseruations are set forth for the guidance not

only of the Laboratory expert assigned to a Major Case squad but

also for the guidance of the Inspector in Charge of the lajor Case

squad and the #l lan.

EQUIPMENT

• At the inception of COORNAP, an inventory was made of

a11 supplies avallable in the Denver Office. Efforts were made to

immediately correct obvious omissions. The following 1tems were

received from other offices or the Bureau:

Shoulder pack transmitters and receivers

IX Unit - transmitter and receiver

Decoy package

Concealed automobile transmitter

Of particular importance among the items assigned to the

Denver Office were the Handie Talkies, the twenty-five watt

transmitter and receiver and Motorola pocket receivers and

transmitters.

In addition to the above, the Bureau forwarded the

infrared viewer, together with infrared lenses for mile ray lamp

and floodlight.

Additionally, the small items which it was felt might

be necessary in the event of a pay off or concurrent investigation

were assembled in one suitcase, as follows:

Flashlight.

Large rolls of two types of twine

Paper clips

Rubber bands

Because of the mountainous and unoccupied area in which

the kidnaping occurred and in which it was felt that if the

victim were murdered a body might be buried, shovels, an ax

and a pick were also obtained. A heavy hammer and stakes were

obtained in anticipation of the necessity of roping off an

area for a crime-scene search.

All of the equipment which it was anticipated might

be used in the investigation was maintained separately from the

regular office equipment so that it could be immediately issued

without searching through cabinets or other receptacles before

Issuing. Each item of equipment was charged to the Agent to

whom issued by the equipment supervisor or a designated alternate.

A separate charge-out book was maintained.

As kidnaping in COORNAP occurred in February, at the

beginning of extremely inclement weather, it was felt that

clothing for outdoor surveillance of pay off should be obtained:

Contact was made with one of the sporting goods stores and the

jollowing. items were obtained on a loan basis:

Three parkas

Three pair of men's down underpants

Three hand warmers

One can of fluid for hand warmers

One pair of khaki pants

Contact was also made with one of the large department

stores and the following items which were not available at the

sporting goods store, were obtained:

Three pair of insulated boots

Three pair of quilted, insulated underwear

Six pair of wool and cotton socks

Three pair of knit wool gloves

Two pair of heavy work pants

Three hoods for face covering

The hand warners were felt necessary because it was

felt that Agents' hands should be warm and facile in the event

of an emergency.

In addition, the departnent store made available the

top half of a male mannequin as it was felt that the male mannequin

could be dressed in clothing and possibly placed on the front

or back seat of an automobile in the event of a pay off or other

activity at night.

All of these items were obtained on a loan basis, and

at the time it vas determined that no pay off would be made the

articles of clothing were returned without charge to these stores.

Arrangements were made with the managers of these

two stores, and with the managers of hardware, radio and electrical

stores, to permit twenty-four hour contact in the event an

emergency arose. It was found that the operators of these stores

were cognizant of the Coors' investigation but were not told in any

instance that the FBI was actually working on this case. They

neither asked for nor were given an explanation for the requests.

The individuals operating these stores were all known to the

Agents of the Denver FBI as reliable persons, and no record of

their names was found in the indices. Even though it was

probably assumed by them that this request was made as the result

## Page 914

of the disappearance of Adolph Coors, III, no mention was made

of this case in contacting them as publicity had appeared to the

effect that the family of the victin had requested all law

enforcement agencies to cease investigation.

As Agents were on twenty-four hour duty at the office

for a considerable period of time and thereaiter worked extra-

ordinarily long hours, it was considered necessary to have food

and coffee available at the office. A coifee percolator was

obtained on a loan basis from one of the coffee suppliers.

Arrangements were made for the delivery of food to the office by

a restaurant as the building in which the Denver IBI Offico is

- located is locked after regular office hours; and, additionally,

local newspapers had reporters posted at the building on a

twenty-four hour basis. is a consequence, it vas necessary for

Agents, particularly those coming in on special, to come tó and

, leave the office space by a circuitous route in an effort to avoid

being seen by these reporters. These Agents were able to obtain

lood and return with it to the office. In larger towns the problea

of obtaining food on a twenty-four hour basis is not acute. In a

smaller town where twenty-four hour restaurant service is not

available, it would probably be uocessary to lay in a larger

stock of food for night consumption or make arrangements with a

restaurant owner to have food available on a twenty-four hour

basis.

I e problem of darkroom facilities did not arise in

the Denver Office during the actual investigation of COORNAD

while the special was on, but subsequently when it was necessary

to prepare a summary report containing numerous blown up

-photographs, it was determined-that the darkroom facilities of the

Denver Office were inadequate. Because this work can be done

at night or on weekends, a request was made of the Denver Police

Department for the use of their darkroom. This darkroom was made

available and adequately handled the large number of photographs

which had to be prepared. The possibility of utilizing police

darisrooms should be considered, particularly if headquarters

are

being set up for an office other than the FBI headquarters city.

Agents designated by the Bureau to come to Denver on

special in COORNAP from the Salt Lake City, Albuguerque and Butte

Offices, brought with them five automobiles which operated on the

same radio frequency as the Denver Office. It was necessary in

• order that these automobiles not be conspicuous that Colorado

license plates be obtained. In addition to obtaining these

license plates, it was necessary to obtain current brake and light

stickers which are placed on windshields of automobiles in

Colorado. These itéms were necessary, of course, to conform with

Colorado law and so that the cars would not be conspicuous.

This

should be remembered in the event of specials in cities such as

Kansas City where tax stickers are placed in the windshield of

automobiles.

## Page 916

It was felt necessary to designate one of the

automobiles of the Coors Lamily as the automobile which would

probably be used for a pay off. The autonobile which it was

thought could be most easily duplicated was so designated. This

was a 1958 Impala owned by Bill Coors, brother to the victim.

Contact was made with numerous car dealers in the Denver area

but none had in his possession an automobile identical to the

car owned by Bill Coors. A Police Captain in a suburban town,

who was

known to be a used-car salesman on the side, was contacted

and he located an automobile similar in appearance. It was

necessary to have this car partially repainted to achieve a two-

tone effect and to place a radio aerial on the right front fender.

Additionally, it was necessary to remove one dealer's metal

identification plate from this car and replace it with a plate

identical to that appearing on Bill Coors' car.

As the possibility existed that the pay off would

necessitate a loose surveillance, would occur in the mountainous

farm or cattle-raising area of Colorado or in metropolitan Denver,

different arrangements had to be made. A taxicab was rented and

a taxicab driver's hat was obtained. Arrangements were made for

immediate delivery from one of the truck rental firms of a cattle

truck or farm truck in the event one was necessary. The taxicab

and the Chevrolet Impala, rented to duplicate Bill Coors' car,

were both stored at a garage near the office where they could be

obtained on a moment's notice.

Arrangements were also made that if necessary a truck

of one of the local public utilities would be available for use

in the event a stationary surveillance in the city area was

necessary.

The automobile of Bill Coors was equipped with the

concealed automobile transmitter (CAT). This unit was located

under the front seat beneath the seat springs. It was activated

by means of the speaker switch of the regular car radio at the

lower center of the dash. The microphone was concealed under

the speaker grill at the center öf the dash. The broadcast

receiver of the regular car radio was disabled by removal of

a fuse.

The antenna of the CAT unit was connected to the exhaust

pipe at the left rear of the car and additional antenna was spread

under the car body.

In both Bill Coors' car and in the car which simulated

it, Handie Talkies were also placed under the front seat and

connected by coaxial cable to the regular automobile antenna.

This antenna was then regulated to the proper length to handle

the Handie Talkie. The speaker of the Handie Talkie was concealed

under the seat but was immediately available, and the switch

controlling this Handie Talkie was placed in such a position that

it could be easily reached by the driver.

It was felt necessary to have a car simulating Bill

Coors' car as it was not known if he and his automobile would

be immediately available on a twenty-four hour basis. The

simulated car, of course, was always kept available.

As it was not known if Adolph Coors, IlI, would be

returned alive or would bekilled by his kidnaper, the identities

of competent physicians were determined in Denver and the

surrounding counties. These individuals can usually be determined

either through personal contact of the Agents in the office or

through contact with the various local law enforcement agencies.

The same is true of autopsy surgeons who are usually known to

local law enforcement officers of coroners. It should also be

borne in mind that it possibly may be necessary to obtain the

identities of coroners in areas considered pertinent to the

investigation. In the COORNAP case these men were contacted

early in the investigation and their cooperation solicited. It

was found that each was cooperative and indicated that he would

not notily the papers or other publicity media, realizing the

necessity of a thorough crime-scene search before the public

invaded the area.

Timetables of the various public transportation

facilities were obtained, but arrangements were also made with

ranking officials at various airlines in Denver to bump

passengers in the event that was necessary in the handling of

COORNAP.

Joseph Corbett had told friends that he hunted in the

Golden Gate Canyon area northwest of Golden, Colorado..

Inasmuch

as a yellow Mercury was earlier reported as pertinent in this

investigation and prior to its discovery burned on a dump in

New Jersey, investigation was conducted in Colorado in an effort

to locate this car. As the car was reported a bright yellow in

color, use was made of a slow flying airplane to search the

Golden Gate area, and also the area contiguous to victim's home

and the bridge from which he disappeared. Consideration was given

to use of a helicopter. This type of machine was not used, however

because of danger in the high rugged mountain area where up drafts

and down drafts might have easily wrecked the plane. The aircraft

was obtained through the services of a Colonel with the U. S. Air.

Force who was also the liaison man with the Civil Air Patrol.

As it was felt that Corbett might demand

payment of

ransom in the mountainous area with which he was reported familiar,

contact was made with stables for the rental of horses. In

addition, it was felt that guides might be necessary and contact

was made with State Game Wardens, U. S. Forestry Service Rangers

and particularly with some of the old-time prospectors and wood

cutters in the mountainous area. These men were constantly

available for assistance.

In COORNAP demand was made for $500,000 ransom. The

only communication received did not specify the type of container

the money should be placed in.. A footlocker, measuring 31" by

16 3/4" by ilt", was found to hold the demanded ransom in mixed

bills. A footlocker of this sort, not metal, was obtained from

a local manufacturer. A hole was cut in the center of the bottom

of the lootlocker so that the switch of the ransom decoy package

would fit within this hole. The switch-was-built up-so that it

would protrude beyond the side of the footlocker. A cloth

similar to the cover used on the footlocker was obtained from

the manufacturer and substituted for the cloth torn when the

hole was cut in the bottom of the footlocker. This cloth was

placed on the footlocker loosely so that it would not activate

the switch. The footlocker was then packed with seventy pounds

of newspaper which was the-approximate.weight of the, bills.. The

ransom decoy package was placed in the tootlocker so that it would

be in an off position when the footlocker was resting on its

bottom. In order to obtain additional transmitting range, a 100p

antenna was placed around the inside of the trunk lid. This was

made of two turns of Belden indoor aerial wire; a condenser was

connected in series with the loop to tune it. This condenser was

mounted at the center of the back edge of the lid of the footlocker

in place of a rivet which was removed. The condenser could then

be tuned by a small screwdriver from either the outside or inside

of the trunk. The loop antenna was connected by a low impedance

Iine to a coupling l00p 2" in diameter and consisting of two turns.

Lining paper matching the interior of the trunk was obtained from

the manufacturer and used to cover the antenna and connecting wires

As twenty-five Agents were sent to the Denver Office

on special, it was necessary to obtain maps for these Agents

in order to facilitate their becoming acquainted with the area.

This required obtaining regular State maps which are obtainable

through service stations, and also maps of the City of Denver

and surrounding suburbs. Before the discovery of the skeleton:

remains of Adolph Coors, III, a detailed search was made of the

mountainous area where the Laboratory stated samples of soil

found under the car destroyed by Corbett, originated. A contact

was made with the Geological Survey for quadrangle maps of the

entire mountain area, and the maps were obtained and supplied

to the Agents making this search. These maps were coordinated

with county maps obtainable through the Siate Highway Department.

A team of four Agents was assigned to each quadrangle map area

which covered approximately seventy miles. These Agents were

instructed to travel every road in the quadrangle and talk to all

residents, and to search all mines, buildings, caves or other

places where a body might be concealed.

Nine stenographers and clerks were sent to the Denver

Office on this special. It was necessary to obtain office

equipment for these

employees. This equipment was obtained

primarily from the General Services Administration on a loan

or rental basis.

At the time the skeleton remains of Adolph Coors, III,

were found it was necessary that a detailed crime-scene search

be conducted. This search covered a large area in rugged

mountainous terrain. A regular crime search line was established

with one man acting as anchor on each end of the tine. In

order to keep both Agents anchoring the line in contact with

the office, the men anchoring the line each carried a lotorola

pocket receiver and transmitter. With these items they were

able to maintain contact with a two-way automobile stationed

In the vicinity, which in turn was able to contact the office

approximately thirty miles away.

The equipment man should maintain

close contact with

all personnel on the special, particularly the Special Agent in

Charge. All requests for any equipment should be channeled

through the equipment supervisor as he may have the equipment

available in the office or have made arrangements for it to be

available at some supplier. It is suggested that the equipment

supervisor be an Agent assigned to the local office because of

contacts already available.

LIAISON AT VICTIM'S HOME IN KIDNAPING CASES

PREFACE

The comments contained herein are based on one

actual experience of being in a kidnaped victim's residence.

Accordingly, it is to be recognized there are many different

circimstances, conditions, problems and types of people that will

differ in each individual case. It is to be noted that the material in

the manual on this topic covers most any situation. The following

is offered as Agents' experiences of having been in the COORS'

residence for some seventeen days beginning February 11, 1960,

three days after ADOLPH COORS, IlI was kidnaped.

On February 9, 1960, the following note was received

by MARY COORS, the wife of victim:

"Mrs. Coors:

"Your husband has been kidnaped. His car is by Turkey Creek.

"Call the police or F. B. I.: he dies.

"Cooperate: he lives.

"Ransom: $200,000 in tens and $300, 000 in twenties.

"There will be no negotiating.

"Bills: used / non-consecutive / unrecorded / unmarked.

"Warning: we will know if you call the police or record the

serial numbers.

"Directions: Place money & this letter & envelope in

one suitcase or bag.

"Have two men with a car ready to make the delivery.

"When all set, advertise a tractor for sale in Denver

"Deliver immediately after receiving call.

Any delay will be regarded as a stall to set up

a stake-out.

"Understand this: Adolph's life is in your hands. We have no desire

to commit murder. All we want is that money. If you follow the

instructions, he will be released unharmed within 48 hours after the

money is received."

The ad was placed in an issue of the Denver Post which

was first available to the public on the night of February 13, 1960.

PREPARING TO GO INTO VICTIM'S HOME

In preparation for going into the victim's home, it is

_essential that all information available relative to the entire case, ás

known as of that time, be obtained as well as background of family and

conditions in the residence.

Some consideration should be given to wearing apparel.

The following are a few of the items which were found to be useful:

Washable, quick dry underwear

Quick dry shirts

-... -

Respectable pair of lounging shoes with soles that will not

make excessive noise when walking around the house

• Adequate sleeping garments

Personal toilet items.

The following equipment was used and found to

be desirable:

Stationery and writing supplies

Typewriter

• Dictaphone

Camera

Sidearms and shotgun

Complete kit for taking fingerprints

Technical equipment necessary to handle the specific

situation should be selected by Agent making

the installation.

It was found that two recordings of each telephone

conversation was essential, indicating additional recording units

would be necessary.

Sufficient attachments for the private phone line to

........

the Field Office enabling each Agent in the residence to

simultaneously enter into conferences with the Person in Charge

of the case.

Monitoring instrument to be attached directly to

the phone on which incoming calls are to be received at the residence.

Arrangements should be made to discreetly enter

the home of the victim.

PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AT VICTIM'S HOME

On arrival at the COORs' residence, on February 11,

1960, local law enforcement officers had departed and a log was

established which would continue to reflect activities there during

the stay of the Agents. First contact at the residence was made with

JAMES GRANT, a lawyer and the brother of MARY COORS, victim's

wife. He advised that a number of family friends were visiting

and that the four COORS' children and some of their friends were

in the house. Other friends were expected to arrive. During the

Initial conversation with GRANT, it was noted that numérous phone"

calls were being received from family friends. MARY COORS

joined the latter part of the conversation with GRANT and it was

explained to them that it was necessary now to have more privacy

in the residence. It was agreed the guests would be excused.

Shortly thereafter, the guests left. The Agents

were shown through the residence for the purpose of familiarizing

them with it. For a detailed description of the house, blueprints

were obtained and are probably still available in the Denver Office.

Briefly the house may be described as located in a rather remote

mountain side location, outside of a suburban community of Denver,

known as Morrison, Colorado. The residence is not in direct view

of any other habitation, but is situated in the foothills in such a

manner that it could be watched from numerous locations in higher

surrounding terrain. The house itself is large with four bedrooms

on the main floor. Three of the bedrooms in line. Adjacent to the

main entrance there is a stairwell down to a daylight basement of

considerable proportions. The bedroom on the extreme end of the

. line of bedrooms is a large room with private bath and dressing room.

It was normally occupied by Mr. and Mrs. COORS. The two bedrooms

in line, separated by a bath and adjoining the master bedroom, were

occupied by the two COORS' girls and the other one by the two COORS'

boys. The fourth bedroom on the first level was separated from

these and normally unoccupied. The remaining space upstairs

composed of a large living room, dining room, kitchen and utility

room. The basement, occupying less space than the first floor,

consisted of a furnace room, large recreation room that was

furnished with complete kitchen facilities in one corner and normal

recreation room furniture. The basement also had a combination

bedroom - office and a bathroom. Adjoining the bedroom - office, is

a room completely enclosed in cement with the exception of one

door from the office, and originally designed as a bomb shelter.

It contained a deep freeze and a few personal items in storage.

The garage is located to the side of and directly

attached to the house near the front entrance. It is accessible from

a door between the end of the garage and the inside of the house.

The doors are electrically controlled. These controls are on the

inside of the garage located directly adjacent to the door entering

the house.

The garage contained space for three automobiles and

storage area.

The normal phone service used by the COORS' family

consisted of a private line with extensions in the bedroom used by

Mr. and Mrs. COORS, one in the kitchen and the third extension in

the recreation area downstairs.

During the tour through the house, MARY and JIM

brought up the question as what should be done about the friends

of MARY COORS expected to arrive within the next few minutes,

most of those coming were bringing food and et cetera. It was

suggested that if they could be reached by telephone, they be

requested not to appear. This MARY COORS did.-

The four children, ranging in ages of 10 to 18,

presented a problem in the residence, in that they were making and

receiving numerous phone calls, and using the entire residence without

being able to understand any imposed restrictions. For security

reasons and the general peace of mind of all, it was decided by MARY

COORS and JIM GRANT that if the children's grandparents,

Mr. and Mrs. COORS, SR., were willing, the four-children should

stay at their residence. This was arranged and the COORS' children

remained at the grandparents' residence until the Agents departed

the victim's home.

In regard to the numerous phone calls that were

being received by MARY COORS, it became obvious that something

=.. -would have:to-be-done to avoid.possible interference with the.....

kidnaper's call. Also each time the phone rang, it completely

interrupted the entire household until the identity of the caller was

known. In this connection, MARY COORS telephonically contacted

two or three of her friends instructing them to call other people who

would be most likely to contact her telephonically, requesting them

to refrain until further notice. In addition, she asked JOE and BILL

COORS, brothers-in-law, to contact their immediate family with

the same request.

The servant arrangement consisted of two maids,

one appearing primarily as a house cleaner, and the other as a

laundry servant. Neither lived in and the arrival of both entailed

- 9

## Page 932

an automobile t. ip to the bus stop by MARY COORS. It was decided

that one full-time maid living in would be more adaptable to the

situation for purposes of security and convenience. MARY COORS

selected the maid to be kept, that selection being based on long time

acquaintanceship and her ability-as a servant-and-cook.-

This reduction of the household members and visitors

left MARY COORS, JIM GRANT and THELMA HOFFMAN, the maid.

In addition, on a schedule of 24 hours each, JOE and BILL COORS

were to alternate being in the residence.

The first evening it was noted that MARY COORS

as.becoming.increasingly netyous. sometimes almost hysterical.

The following day, with JIM GRANT'S assistance, MARY COORS

invited a friend as a permanent house guest.

All of the above arrangements, with the exception of

having MARY COORS invite her friend in to stay, were undertaken

and accomplished on the first afternoon the Agents arrived. During

this same period of time, a considerable number of requests were

made of MARY COORS for specific bits of information or things she

was to do. Some would be forgotten by her. It was the Agents'

experience in the residence with all members of the family, that it

was more desirable to make one specific request or resolve one

problem at a time rather than a number of them.

## Page 933

The schedule of service people who should call at

the residence was established so that there would be no Agent personnel

in sight when they arrived. MARY COORS' doctor was identified and

places where he would be available at all times established. This was

for the primary purpose of being able-to-locate-him should she require -

his attention.

Living quarters for the three Agents was established

in the daylight basement. Inasmuch as two Agents were scheduled

to be awake at all times, the one bed in the office with adjoining bath

was sufficient. One end of the recreation room, out of sight of the

wisestairwell and windows, was used for installation of private line and

recording equipment.

It was felt it was necessary to reduce the number of

telephone extensions to avoid any individual answering the phone

except the one selected to receive the kidnaper's call. Due to the

physical layout of the house, the extension in the recreation room

was left in service as it was available only to the Agents. As the

person answering the phone, should the kidnaper call, would be one

of the family, the extension in the master bedroom was designated

for this purpose. With MARY COORS' consent, this room was

converted into an office for the purpose of receiving phone calls and

most generally was occupied by one Agent and the member of the family

who was expecting to receive the call at the time. This separation

turned out satisfactorily in that it left the recreation room private

for the Agents' use with the technical equipment, dictating, use of the

private line and other general official activities, eliminating the

necessity of anyone but Agents to-be there. The phone extension in

the kitchen was disconnected. The other three bedrooms upstairs

were used by MARY COORS and her friend, JIM GRANT and the

COORS' brother in the residence, and the maid.

FLANS TO RECEIVE KIDNAPER'S CALL

MARY COORS was anxious to receive the phone call

but it was felt by the Agents present that she would be the least

capable of carrying on a conversation with the kidnaper.

JIM GRANT, age 42, Harvard Law graduate and

practicing attorney in New York, left the impression with the Agents

that he was the most desirable individual to receive an incoming call

from the kidnaper.

JOE COORS and BILL COORS, who alternated at the

residence, were to relieve JIM GRANT during the time.hewas.te=::

sleep. GRANT was actually around and available to answer the

phone from 10:00 A.M. until 2:00 A.M. During the rest of the 24-

hour cycle, either JOE or BILL COORS was present for this purpose.

In giving instructions to the persons that were to answer the phone,

it was not necessary to include questions that would determine

whether or not the victim was alive, inasmuch as the family had

agreed that they wanted to pay the ransom money irrespective of

whether they had proof that he was alive. It was desirable to retain

the caller on the phone as long as possible to afford the possibility

of tracing the phone call.

Several questions were formulated, the answers of which

would determine if it was the kidriaper calling, were typed and left by the

- 13 -

phone that was to be used for incoming calls. In addition, on the

same desk attached to the phone was a monitoring instrument giving

an Agent across the desk a chance to hear both sides of any telephone

conversation coming into the residence. This was in addition to

monitoring and recording equipment in the recreation room. This

instrument was designed so the Agent could only listen and was

unable, to talk in it or have any other room noises interfere. To

facilitate the Agent having control over this conversation without

unduly interrupting a member of the family receiving the call, a

prompting board was improvised. On this board, which was a door

from-the basement, was large printed phrases, as prompters, to...

help the person taking the call to prolong the conversation and to

obtain pertinent information from the kidnaper. Some of these

phrases were:

-

SLOW DOWN

READY TO PAY

WILLING TO PAY

REPEAT THAT

PERSONAL ITEMS

ROADS ARE BAD - SNOW

HOW DO I KNOW YOU ARE THE KIDNAPER

## Page 937

; M GRANT had a tendency to static-repeat phrases

made to the person he was talking to. He was encouraged and so were

JOE and BILL COORS on all conversations to static-repeat the phone

conversation.

There was never any intention that all these phrases

should be used in any one conversation. A baton type pointer was

available for the Agent to point to particular phrases which would be

applicable at that point in the conversation. Also on the desk to

facilitate the person carrying on the conversation was a copy of the

ransom note, typed questions, and a memo scratch pad and a crayon

was available to write reminders to the individual accepting the cali.

Mock practices were conducted with all three individuals

who were expected to possibly take the call. In addition, prior to

the series of family calls being eliminated, the element of

repeating, slow down and other phrases on the board were used without

interfering with personal calls coming in.

INTERVIEWS OF MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY

Members of the family in the residence were repeatedly

and almost constantly interviewed in a conversational manner.

These

interviews covered all subject matters pertinent to the case. The

close association for many hours within each 24-hour period made

it possible to handle interviews and problems in strictly a

conversational manner. This arrangement seemed ideal in that it

was possible to stay abreast of the family's thinking. At the same time,

it was imperative that each Agent in the residence be consistent with

- each other and advise the Person in Charge in order that all problems

Could be handled in an acceptable"manner withou contradiction.

It was felt necessary to note the answer to questions

propounded to members of the family by each Agent to avoid repeating

the same question to the same member of the family unnecessarily.

In eliminating personal items the victim could have had

on his person at the time of his abduction, a complete inventory was

made of his personal effects in the residence including clothing, as

well as those personal items in his office.

Hair specimens were obtained from victim's personal

brush and comb.

With MARY COORS' permission, all records and

papers in the residence were reviewed.

HANDLING OF RANSOM MONEY AT RESIDENCE

On the evening of February 12, the prepared ransom

money in the amount of $500, 000 was delivered to the residence by

bank officials. It arrived in a sealed canvas bag and was accepted at the

residence by BILL COORS. It was placed in the bomb shelter room

previously described. This room had been selected because it was not

accessible from the outside of the house and the one inside door could

be locked. In this room was placed two footlockers, one of which was

to be used to deliver the money in. These two lockers had been marked

for future identification prior to arrivai in the residence. One of them

contained a radio sounding device, the other had no equipment. Also in

this room was placed the original ransom note and an exact facsimile.—

The money was left in the sealed canvas bag. Depending on the circum-

stances and instructions immediately prior to delivery, it was to be

placed in one of the footlockers with one of the notes. The door of this

room was locked at all times after the above articles were placed therein.

The key on a string was worn around the neck of the member of the

family who was on duty to receive the call from the kidnaper. The

foreseeable things to be done immediately after receiving a call from the

kidnaper were divided among the Agents in the residence. The additional

preparation of the money and placing it into the automobile in the garage

- 19 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

## Page 942

was to be handled by one Agent and the COORS' brother on duty at

the time. The money was never delivered. It was accepted by

bank officials in the residence for return to the bank. It was in the

original sealed bag, avoiding the necessity of recounting the money.

It should be pointed out that the Person in Charge was

constantly advised by private telephone line of all arrangements and

activity described. This was done on a continuing basis.

The Person in Charge kept Agents in the residence

informed in detail as to his general thinking, and problems which could

occur involving the family. These telephone conferences on things

that might happen in the future made it possible for the Agents in the

residence to answer questions and make decisions with the family.

He in turn was advised of each question asked by the family and the

answer given. Through this manner, the Agents and Person in Charge

were consistent with the family in all matters.

The technical equipment making it possible for all Agents

at the residence to simultaneously carry on a conversation with the

Person in Charge eliminated the necessity of paraphrasing his

instructions and ideas and added to their ability to act in harmony.

• The individual Agents in the victim's home also kept

each other advised of all conversations with and questions asked and

answers given to members of the family:

MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED

IN THE VICTIM'S RESIDENCE:

Due to the arrival some days after the kidnaping, many

of the necessary things had been done in connection with the residence

assignment. Those items are mentioned in the "manual and are not

being repeated here.

Agents, prior to entering the residence, in a conference

with the Person in Charge reached the conclusion that there was a strong

liklihood the victim was not alive.

On entering the residence, they felt that it was imperative

to receive as clear and detailed telephone call from the kidnaper as ...

possible. It was also felt necessary to associate with the family in

a manner that would result in them taking no action that would interfere—

with the investigation of the case.

The family were continually reassured that the answers

to their questions and problems were given them ly the Agents present,

with the full knowledge and consideration of the Person in Charge. It

was pointed out that the Person in Charge had much experience in

kidnaping cases, and in turn, on their behalf, was consulting with

FBI officials in Washington, D. C., including Mr. HOOVER himsef.

In one instance, the family inquired as to the necessity

of the detailed coverage of the expected telephone call from the kidnaper.

- 21 -

NW 55044-DacId: 32989526

Page 943

---

## Page 944

In this instance, as well as every other opportunity, it was pointed'

out to the family that the safe return of the victim was the first and

primary object of the FBI. That the necessity for complete coverage

of the phone call was first to make sure that clear instructions were

obtained from the kidnaper in order that they could be complied with,

resulting in the release of the victim. That, secondly, the coverage

might assist in leading to the identification and apprehension of the

individual responsible for the kidnaping.

The Agents in the residence were frank at all times in

answering the various questions and problems and tried to avoid

leaving any impression of mystery and evasiveness in their actions

and conduct.

JM GRANT, after some time had elapsed and no

contact from the kidnaper had been received, asked the question, are

you actually going to pay the money to the kidnaper when it is

recognized the victim is dead? It was pointed out to him that was a

decision to be made by the family and they had already reached the

decision that the money would be paid whether or not he was alive.

Getting necessary items in and out of the house was

handled by BILL and JOE COORS, in that they exchanged shifts

daily, this presented no problem.

## Page 945

Permission to intercept and open all mail addressed

to the COORS' residence had previously been obtained and this was

handled at the Post Office. It placed no particular responsibility on

the Agents in the residence. However, contents of the extortion letters

intercepted at the Post Office were relayed over the direct line to the-

Agents in the residence and were made known to the family for their

decision as to complying with them. No particular problem was

encountered in having them reach a decision. When practical, these

notes were presented in the A. M. in that MARY COORS could respond

more logically then than later in the day.

Mian

The identity of several individuals were furnished by

members of the family as suspects.

Particularly BILL COORS would

pursue the results and inquire in connection to these suspects very

persistently. Although few of the suspects from the very, beginning

had any logical basis, it left a better impression with the family when

they could be advised rather promptly that that individual had been

eliminated as a suspect and why. Bearing in mind that at this stage

of the case, a very limited investigation was being conducted, it is

believed where logical, these suspects reported by the family should

be eliminated.

After the children had moved to the grandparents'

residence, they continued to be some bother to MARY COORS in

making requests of her for permission to go various places such as

- 23 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 945

---

## Page 946

school, skiing and visiting friends.

There were Agents stationed at the grandparents'

residence and after advising them of the children's bother to their

mother, they were able to eliminate it.

News Releases: The two COORS' brothers and

Mr. COORS, SR., as a matter of business policy and custom, had

lunch each day in the COORS, SR. residence located and adjoining their

place of business. At that time, they would discuss problems and have

a mutual agreement as to the solution. That custom continued over in

regard to this case. The major decisions that were reached in this

case concerning the family were reached at a conference of the COORS'

family, including MARY COORS and JIM GRANT, with the Person in

Charge being present. These conferences were held in COORS, SR.

residence, usually shortly after the lunch hour. In regard to press

releases, the COORS' family, in connection with their business, had a

press representative. The handling of the press releases were cleared

through him and he in turn would clear with the Person in Charge prior

to any release being made in connection with this case. On one occasion

later in the stay of the Agents in the residence, MARY COORS wanted to

make a final appeal through the press for the kidnaper to contact her.

The fact that she was thinking of this release was known to the Agents

in the residence a day or so ahead and finally she presented to them a

copy of her proposed release. At the suggestion of the Person in Charge,

some changes were made by MARY COORS and it was handled as stated above.

- 24 -

NW 55044 Docid: 32989526

## Page 947

The family had decided that BILL or JOE COORS,

under no circumstances, would personally deliver the ransom money.

JIM GRANT had volunteered to help in any way he could, including

delivering the ransom money. The Person in Charge of the investigation

had decided that JIM GRANT and one of the Agents in the residence

would jointly deliver the ransom money. In the event the ransom money

was to be delivered, one Agent, as previously described, was to handle the

final packaging of the ransom money. One Agent immediately on the

conclusion of the call was to transcribe verbatim the phone call for the

use of the Person in Charge. The third Agent was to furnish verbally

-

this information to and receive the final instructions from the Person in

Charge.

CECIL KENDRICK was the friend that MARY COORS

selected to have stay with her and who did stay with her for the first

week. On arriving at the COORS' residence, which was the next day

after the Agents arrived, she was cautioned about security features, but

was given a free rein to console and help MARY COORS in any way she

thought best. However, she was cautioned as to the possibility that the

victim might not be alive and to bear this in mind in offering MARY any

assurance on this point. CECIL KENDRICK had to leave the residence

for personal reasons and another friend, JAN PHIPPS, took her place

in the residence and she was given similar instructions.

## Page 948

The possibility that the kidnaper might not recontact the

family was recognized from the outset by the Person in Charge.

Actually the kidnaper did not recontact the family. This

resulted in one of the principal problems for the Agents in the residence.

The problem being to assist the family in deciding on a date they would

no longer wait for a call and all out active investigation could begin.

This problem was not actually broached by the Agents

in the first instances. During the last several days of their stay in the

residence, on different occasions, individual members of the family

would open this subject. The problem would then be discussed with that

member in a specific and frank manner. The actual date was decided on

in a family conference at the COORS, SR. residence, the Person in

Charge being present.

Having a bearing on this problem, was one of the most

frequent questions asked by individual members of the family from the

outset. Is "AD" alive? The answer would consist of enumerating the

factual circumstances.

From the beginning, their conclusions would be

that he probably was not alive, yet this same question would be put to an

Agent a short time later. • Never was there any encouragement that he

was alive given to the family.

Another question: When will he (the kidnaper) call?

Here again, no encouragement was ever extended to the family. The

point was made that if "AD'' was dead resulting in the kidnaper losing

- 26 -

- NW-55044-DocId:32989526 Page 948

---

## Page 949

his security, there might never be a call.

It is believed the frank approach to these questions,

as well as all others, from the outset, materially assisted in having

some influence with the family and their thinking in resolving their

problem of terminating the wait for a contact by the kidnaper.

SETTING UP CHIEF CLERK'S OFFICE ON

SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT CASES

When a major case has occurred and the investigation

Is to be handled as a "special," of course, the SAC of the

office involved and the Bureau have discussed the matter as

to the number of Special Agent personnel necessary. In addition,

discussion is had as to the number of extra stenographers and

at least four clerical employees should be borne in mind as

being necessary to handle the "paper work" in connection with

the handling of a "special."

The field office in which the major crime has occurred

has already opered a case, for example: a kidnaping, and un-

doubtedly the first serial appearing therein will be a memorandum

of some Special Agent reflecting that he received a call from

someone advising that a particular individual has been kidnaped

or disappeared.

Probably the next serial, or Serial #2, will be a

copy of a teletype to the Bureau or a memorandum reflecting

a telephone call with the Bureau.

Subsequent serials will reflect, as a rule, memoranda

of different Agents as to what they have done or information

they have received.

In connection with the handling of a "special,"

arrangements should first be made to obtain some particular

section of the office which will be away from other Agents of

L MW. 55044_DocId: 32989526

Page 950

---

## Page 951

the office ar. away from the public so that the inspector ca

man in charge of the "special" can have his grcup

in one space.

The temporary Chief Cler''s Office (CCO) should,

of course, be

allocated a corner or section of that area, and the office ir

question should already make arrangenents to have brought in a

number of extra file cabinets and other offica supplies which

are used in the operation of a CCC.

Generally in the reguiar CCO, files contain a number

of serials; for example, one file or volume may possibly cos-

tain 75 to 100 serials. However, in connection with a "speciai,"

it has been found that if each volume contains oniy 25 serials,

this helps a great deal; that is , Volune No. I should have

Serials 1 to 25, Volume io:"?'should have Serials 26 to 56, and

so forth. The reason io: breaking down these tolumes containing

only 25 serials is that as the case progresses Agents will hate

to refer to references and previous serials and li severai

Agents have to lock in one volume which would contain a hurdred

serials, it would involve a loss of time, and so forth, whereas

smaller volumes will be more readily available.

In addition to starting these volunes contuining cazy

25 serials, sub-files should immediately be opened in ordes to

channel into that sub-file an extra copy of a memorandum, airiel

os tcletype..

Foi example, as soon as a "special" is started, there

will be a number of communications referring to Agents, stencgraphes

and clerical employees leaving their headquarters city

- 2 -

..NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 951

---

## Page 952

for the office where the "special" is being handled. Instead of

having all of these communications put in the regular investi-

gative file, this type of communication should be placed in a

sub-file which can be given a number, for example, Sub-file A,

and it can be entitled "personnel Matters." With this sub-file

in existence, any subsequent correspondence relating to personnel

should be placed in that file and no copies be placed in the

regular investigative file. Then, if the person in charge of

the "special" or his assistants need any information regarding

personnel, the same is readily available in one volume.

www..

At about the same time the Bureau will probably issue

instructions that a weekly communication should be forwardea to

the Bureau setting forth cost data, and a sub-file should be

opened for that phase. In other words, the Bureau will issue

instructions to the office where the "special" is being handled

to notify all offices to submit weekly communications relative

to the extra cost involved. All of these communications should

be placed in that particular sub-file and no copies should be

placed in the main investigative file. For example, this section

can

1 be called Sub-file B and it can be entitled "Cost Data."

As soon as the newspapers start publishing their

articles, there will be many newspaper articles and a sub-file

should be opened which, for example, can be Sub-file C entitled

"Newspaper Clippings.". A copy of every newspaper item should

be placed in this sub-file and, of course, an extra copy be

- 3-

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 952

---

## Page 953

forwarded to the Bureau daily. In addition, these newspaper

clippings should be reviewed for possible leads and all

pertinent names appearing therein should be indexed. These

newspaper clippings will, of course, be properly mounted,

serialized and initialed before being placed in this sub-file.

The Bureau will generally issue instructions to

submit a daily teletype summary, and it has been found advisable

to place the regular copies in the regular investigative file;

but an extra copy should be placed in a sub-file, for example,

Sub-file D, entitled "Daily Summaries." By having an extra

copy in this sub-file, one can readily refer to that file which

will contain a day-by-day summary of the activities that have

been described to the Bureau.

Of course, another sub-file should be opened which

should contain instructions relative to the logs that are

maintained at the commencement of the "special" in order that

all such information will be readily available in one sub-file.

It is also advisable to open a sub-file to contain an extra

copy of "Narrative Memoranda."

Inasmuch as the telephone company will be contacted

immediately and interviews will be had with various telephone

officials, all of which will be recorded in memorandum form,

it is deemed advisable to open a sub-file, which can be

entitled "Confidential Telephone File," and all copies of

memoranda submitted regarding the installation of telephones,

placed in this file and no copies at all be placed

in the

investigative file. Again, if one desires to know what has

been done in connection with the telephone situation, this

one sub-file is readily available and should contain all

pertinent data.

As a rule, neighboring offices will be instructed

by teletype or telephone calls to ship in to the interested

office extra equipment that might be needed and in order to

have this information available and in one file, a sub-file

should be opened, which probably can be entitled "Equipment,"

and copies of all communications, and so forth, can be

placed in this file so that the property man ur Agent in

charge of the property can readily have available and in

one file all information relative to equipment that has

been shipped in, rented or obtained fron other sources.

• If the major crime receives publicity, as it

undoubtedly will, there will be many communications prepared

relative to contacts with the press, TV or radio stations,

and it has been found advisable to open a sub-file, which

can be entitled "press Services," and in this file a copy

of the memoranda should be placed, whereas the original and

other copies will be in the investigative file. Again, if

any question comes up regarding the press, and so forth,

. a copy of every communication is in this one sub-file, which

will be readily available.

WW.55044 DocId:32989526 _Page 954

## Page 955

A similar sub-file should be opened which can be

entitled "Western Union." This sub-file should reflect results

of contact with Western Union officials and, again, all copies

of such communications should be placed in this sub-file.

In connection with a kidnaping case, the question

of circularizing arises, and it has been found advisable to

open a sub-file, which can be entitled "Ransom Circularization, "

and in this file should be placed an extra copy of each communi-

cation relating to this phase of the investigation. Of course,

the original and other copies are in the investigative file,

but, again, by having an extra copy in the sub-file, the

person handling that particular phase will have at his fingertips

copies of all communications relating to that matter.

-

When the unknown subject is identified and, for

example, a wanted flyer or identification order is prepared,

it has been found that the office supervisor in the case will

• on a number of occasions instruct other offices to circularize,

for example, bus depots, barber shops, and so forth. When this

is done, the other offices will send a letter or communication

advising that the particular circularization has been done,

and it has been found of an assistance to have a sub-file opened

entitled, for example, "Yanted Flyer Circularization," and an

extra copy of that communication is designated for that sub-file.

At the start of a kidnaping case, of course, written

authority will be obtained from the victim's family or close

friends relatire to checking mail at the Post Office; and it

has been

found advisable to open a sub-file, which

can be

entitled "Post Office File," and place therein

ald

communi-

cations or memoranda relating to this phase of the investi-

gation and do not place copies-in-the regular investigative

file. If the person in charge, or someone else, desires to

know what the situation is relative to the inquiry made or

set up at the Post Office, this file will have all information

in it.

It has also been found advisable to open a sub-file

which will contain a copy of all memoranda or other communi-

cations which more or less contain "policy matters" or

instructions given by the Bureau to the person handling

the special assignment or contain suggestions, and so forth. .

The originals, of course, which would be memoranda, teletypes

or airtels, would be placed in the investigative file, but

a copy should be placed in this sub-file so that the same

will be readily available to the person in charge or his

assistants if any information is desired as to Bureau policy

or instructions.

In addition, of course, an exhibit and 1-A files are

opened and maintained similar to that in the regular field

division office.

It: has also been found advisable to open another

file and to entitle it "Informants." As time goes on, all

- 7-

• NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 956

## Page 957

)

offices, especially the office handling the "special," will

be asked to contact all criminal informants, potential

criminal informants, and other sources, and the office in

question will probably submit an extra copy of FD-209

reflecting a contact with an informant, and instead of

putting that in the investigative file, it should be

designated for the sub-file. Likewise, other offices will

from time to time send an airtel or letter reflecting

results of their informants and, again, all copies should

be placed in this sub-file.

At the commencement of each "special," as a rule,

inquiries are conducted regarding

transportation facilities

and, as a result, much information, pamphlets, and so forth,

will be obtained relative to airplane, train, bus, and other —

means of transportation, and it has been found advisable to

place

all copies of such information in a sub-file, which

can be entitled "Transporation," so that the Special Agent

handling that particular phase will have readily available

in one file all such data.

Many green sheets, of course, will be prepared

containing bulky exhibits and other pieces of evidence,

and a sub-file should be opened containing an extra copy

of those so that they will be readily available at any

time.

As the case progresses, undoubtedly criminal

records will be obtained from the Identification Division

of the Bureau, and it has been found that instead of

placing them in the investigative file that a sub-file

should be opened and all criminal records be placed in

this sub-file and, of course, indexed to that sub-file.

Here again, one will have in a particular volume, or

volumes, nothing but identification records which will

be more readily available than having to go through the

investigative file for them.

In connection with a kidnaping, the victin's

family or relatives will undoubtedly receive a number

of letters from "nuts," "crackpots," and from respectable

people, and it has been found advisable that instead of

placing

; these in the regular investigative file that a

sub-file should be opened and they should be placed

therein and, of course, indexed and serialized so that

one, again, will have in one volune all such letters that

have been received.

In connection with a kidnaping, one probably will

receive at least one or more letters, and it has been found

advisable to open a sub-file which will contain either

photostatic copies or photographic copies of such letters

which are known to come from the kidnaper. The purpose

of this sub-file is so that Agents in connection with their

-9 -

ANN- 55014 DocId: 32969526 Page 358

---

## Page 959

)

investigation can readily read and observe the type of communi-

cation that was sent and, of course, this file will have photo-

graphic copies and not the original.

As a rule in connection with a kdinaping case, there

will be a large number of other extortion letters which-are

received and, oi course, when it is readily known that such

type of letters do not come fron the kidnaper, separate

Extortion. (9) cases should be opened and handled by the

personnel in the office and not by the men on the special

assignment. However, in order to keep a record as to such

letters, and so forth, it has

been found advisable to

open a sub-file and to see to it that an extra copy on the.

main communication to the Bureau is placed in this file.

For example, in connection with a kidnaping case, the first

crackpot letter that is received can be given number "I,"

the next number "2," and so forth, then, as these new "g"

cases are opened and a letter is sent to the Bureau in that

"g" case, an extra copy should be designated for the sub-file

and one can thereafter pick up this sub-iile and readily

observe just what other extortion letters have been received.

As the case progresses, one will receive many

FBI Laboratory reports, and it has been found that instead

of placing these in the regular investigative file that a

sub-file should be opened and all copies should be filed in

that sub-file

after being serialized, indexed, and so forth,

- 10 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 959

---

## Page 960

so that one will have in one sub-file every FBI Laboratory

report that has been submitted.

A similar sub-file can be opened up which should

contain Latent Fingerprint Section communications.

Of course, a photograph-file is also-opened-and

maintained similar to that of the exhibit file.

• The opening of the main investigative file and these

sub-files, of course, is to conform with Bureau instructions

relative to the operations of a CCO, and the items appearing

in these sub-files, of course, are serialized, stamped,

initialed, and so forth, and are indexed.

" The main purposa in having. such suh-files. referred

to above is so that during the early stages of the investi-

gation of the major case, one can readily "put his finger"

on certain communications or correspondence that the person

in charge or his assistants may want to quickly or readily

refer to.

Each major case may present different problems

and in some types of cases one may want to open additional

sub-files which again should contain only a copy of the

communications or memorandum.

For example, in almost every

kidnaping case much investigation will be conducted relative

to identifying the type of paper, and it has been found that

in addition to filing the original and copy of the communi-

cation or memorandum in the main investigative file that

• 11 -

1% 75044 DocId: 32989526

Page

960

---

## Page 961

an extra copy be designated for a sub-file which can

be

entitled "Ransom Paper Project." The Agents handling

that particular phase of the investigation will readily

have available in one sub-file copies of all communi-

cations relating to that phase. The same would apply

to possibly identifying a typewriter if a typewriter

was used in the preparation of the ransom letter or

letters.

'After the segular investigative file and

whatever sub-files that are needed are opened, the problem

-arises. as to seeing to it that the information appearing

in these files can be readily found and located when needed.

By this time, some clerical employee will have

been designated as the Chief Clerk of the "special," or,

as in some cases, a regular Chief Clerk will be brought in

to the office where the "special" is being handled and at

that tine indices will have to be set up and organized.

The regular index in the ordinary CCO is broken

down alphabetically by the rame of the parson or firm and

then there will be indices for motor numbers of automobiles,

guns, and a few other items; however, in connection with a

"special," the chief Clerk or one of the other clerks who

will handle that phase should be instructed to immediately

set up a number of other type of guide cards. For example,

index cards will, of course, be filed alphabetically;

-

NW 55044

Docid: 32959526 Page 361

-12 -

---

## Page 962

automobiles will be indexed and filed by motor number.

The same should apply for guns, typewriters, and other

items. In other words, special guide cards should be

placed therein, for example, "Guns," "Typewriters."

As the case goes along, one may want other breakdowns.

and guide cards can be placed therein. For example,

guide cards can be made for the words "Bodies," "Bloody

Cars," "Evidence," "Phone Numbers," and numerous other

items.

In connection with the indices maintained in

a "special," one should see to it that such items are

marked for indexing and are indexed becance as the case

progresses many times an individual will recall some

incident relating to a bloody car or a telephone number

or to something else but cannot recall the name of the

person involved; however, by having such breakdowns in

the indices, one can readily refer to them and find the

communication in question.

In addition, instead of making one index card,

two index cards should be made. For example, Serial #1

will probably contain a memorandum of a Special Agent to

the SAC reflecting that a Mr. JOHN SMITH, for example,

of say Jones and Company, phoned and stated that his

nephew, JOHN BLACK, was believed kidnaped and that

JOHN BLACK is the president of Black Corporation. In

.....

- 13 -

NW 55044-DasTa: 32939525

Page 9162

---

## Page 963

connection wich this particular memorandum, which would be

Serial #1 probably, one would readily see that the

individual marking such communication for indexing will

underline all four of the above names and duplicate

index cards should be made with a little identifying

data on each card, and the copy of these index cards

will be filed in the "speical" indices while the criginal

will subsequently be forwarded to the main CCO in that

particualr field division for filing in their main and

permanent indices.

The CCO of the field division, not the temporary

special CCO, when they rective the above original four

cards, should receive instructions that they are to search

those cards, and if there are any references, they should

• be placed on the Indices Search Slip, FD160, and returned

to the "special squad" so that they can be assigned out

and such references reviewed to determine whether or not

any of the information may be of interest or value to

the regular office or to the "special squad."

The regular CCO should also be instructed that

after they have once received the index card, for example,

On JOHN BLACK, and the clerk notes that there already

has been a card filed referring to the "special case,"

they need not send back any additional Indices Search

Slips, but only

when they receive an index card bearing

- 14 .

DorId: 32989526

Page 963

---

## Page 964

a new name which has not been indexed to the "special case."

Say for example, the first memorandum, or Serial

#1, made reference to the person phoning in stating that he

had heard there was a "body" found in a certain lake and _

that he did not know whether that body might belong to the

victim or not. The person marking communications for

indexing would, of course, underline the word "body" in

blue so that the clerks in the temporary CCO haudling the

"special" would then know that Serial #1 should be indexed

under the caption of "Body." This procedure should like-

"wise be followed for any similar breakdowns as mentioned

above.

In addition, the CCO in charge of the "special

squad" should obtain a file box, 42 x 52 x 10", in which

-3"x5" cards can be filed. In this box there should be

prepared guide cards for each of the field offices and

they should be filed in alphabetical order, including

guide cards for legal attaches, as well as a separate

guide card for the Bureau and a separate guide card for

the office in which the "special" is being handled:

for example, Volume I which contains Serial #1, mentioned

heretofore, which is a memorandum of a Special Agent in

that office prepared for his SAC. The 3'x5" index card

behind the office,

for example,

Denver, where the special

-

- 15 -

WW 550442007d:32989526-Page_964

---

## Page 965

is being handled, should have typed in the center of the

3'x5" card, on top, "Denver."

On the first line on this card should be placed

a little resume as to that particular serial. For example:

"S.1

SA BROWN memo 6/1/60, SAC re JOHN SMITH

phoning re disappearance of JOHN BLACK.

For example, Serial #2, in Volume I, would

probably be the office teletype to the Bureau or would

be a memorandum reflecting a phone call to the Bureau,

and the guide card marked "Bureau" will have an index

card and similar information will be placed on that card

for Serial #2.

As the volumes containing the investigative file

are made and each contains 25

serials, one of the clerical

employees should be designated to see to it that this

particular index box, with cards, is maintained up-to-date

and as quickly as possible. The purpose of this particular

box of cards is to show what communication has been sent

to or received from a particular office or to the Bureau.

For example, the Bureau guide card will later on have a

number of cards and one can, by readily looking at these

cards, get a resume or idea as to the gist of those

communications referred to, and if the person in charge

or one of his assistants asks for a particular piece of

correspondence, by checking this special indices one can

- 16 -

page

965

---

## Page 966

..

readily find the same.

It is to be noted that separate index cards are

not made for each serial. For example, behind the guide

card marked "Bureau" will be at first only one index card

and on that index card will be typed a resume.of the

contents of the connunications, say, for example, for

ten different serials, and that card, of course, is marked

in the upper right-hand corner "I." When that card is

filled, card "2" is placed behind it, card "3," and so forth.

To reiterate, the person in charge asks for a com-

munication received from the Miami Office three weeks

previously and one can go to this index box, look behind

"Miami," look up and down the few cards that are there, and

can readily locate the communication he is interested in.

In this box the section for the office where this

"special" is being worked out of will, of course, bave

numerous cards and it has been found on many occasions to

be of assistance to refer to that guide card, say, for

example, "Denver," when looking for some communications,

especially when the name of the person is not recalled,

and by glancing up and down these cards one will quickly

and readily find the communication desired. One clerical

employee can generally be kept busy merely bandling this

phase of the project, as such employee, as new volumes are

made, will take a volume and take this index box with

the

- 17 -

NIR

DocId: 32989526 Page 966-

---

## Page 967

)

cards and add such information on the necessary caras.

To

further explain it, for example, the New York Office sends

a communication in to the Denver Office reflecting an inter-

view with THOMAS JONES. This communication, after being

serialized, is noted by the cler' who will add the serial

number onto the index card of the New York Office showing

that serial number so and so relates to interview with

THOMAS JONES.

Going back to the special indices which are

being maintained, it was mentioned before that the original

card will go to the front office or to theCCo in that

division while the copy will be retained in the special

indices.

The special indices, of course, should be

infornative and should not merely contain the name of

an individual, an automobile,

an address, or something

like that, and the serial number to which it relates.

For example, the inspector's assistant or No. 1

man, or whatever title he has, who handles the mail

consisting of teletypes, reports, airtels and memoranda,

generally should mark for indexing, by underlining in

blue

pencil, what items in that communication he believes

should be indexed. Of course, at first, preference should

be given to over-indexing, and by that is meant that in

a particular communication almost every name, whether of

18-

DecId: 32989526 Page 967

---

## Page 968

an individual or a firm, should be indexed. On many occasions

telephone numbers of suspects or underworld characters should

be marked for indexing, as well as possibly their addresses.

In the meantine, of course, the special indices will have guide

eards for such telephone numbers, addresses, and so forth. In

addition, if the communication makes reference to a body or to

some other item, that should be marked for indexing.

In other words, when that piece of correspondence

leaves the desk of the inspector's assistant, No. I man, or

whatever he is called, it is underlined in blue and, of course,

is marked with other notations as to a copy being designated

for a certain Agent or a lead slip, to be made, and so forth,

and these items will be mentioned later.

If a capable clerical employee is obtained, such

employee can be given instructions as to how to maintain the

Informative index, and after such employee gets the "knack,"

that employee can handle this phase of the work, thereby

saving the services of a Special Agent who would otherwise

have to dictate the same to a stenographer.

Such clerical employee in the temporary CCO of

the "special," when he gets that communication, will, 1f

there has been no previous index card made, make two index

cards for the name of the suspect. The original, as

mentioned before, will go to the regular CCO in that division;

however, on these two cards the clerk will type a brief narrative,

'seriends"

-19 -

-WW-3512044

## Page 969

for example, that Serial 25 reflects the suspect THOMAS WHITE

•was

interviewed by the New York Office on a certain date and

established an alibi. If the comnunication made reference to

a ody being found in a lake, the clerk would automatically

I ow that under the guide card for "Bodies" there would be an

ndex card and on that index card he would put a sentence or

wo reflecting what that communication said regarding the

body referred to therein.

In other words; a clerical enployee properly instructed

can maintain this special indices which has been set up for the

"special squad."

In addition, if these clerical employees are

instructed properly, they will be always on the alert for tying

in names, addresses, telephone numbers, and other itens as such

information is being recorded on such cards.

For example, the indices may have a card for a certain

individual being an ex-convict and as being a possible suspect.

• A weeks or two later another communication comes to that clerk's

attention wherein references is made to a similar name of an

individual who might have. had a suspicious car in his possession.

As those two names are matched up, an alert clerical employee

will call it to the attention of someone who can determine what

further action can be taken.

The person in charge of the clerical employees, who

can be referred to as the temporary Chief Clerks, will, of course,.

see that the connunications, memoranda, ánd so forth are serialized

- 20 -

NW- 55044DocId 32909526 Page 969

---

## Page 970

and disseminatel into the proper files or sub-files

and so forth,

and will also see that the operation of the temporary

• CCO is

being handled in accordance with Bureau instructions for a

regular CCO.

A fourth clerical employee will always find other .

similar duties and, as mentioned before, if at-least four-clerical

employees are assigned at the start, one can, as a rule, keep up

with the indexing, serializing and recording, as this is an im-

portant phase of the Bureau's work, and if there are not enough

clerical employees, these matters get behind and one will never

get caught up.

Bulky exhibits, of course, should be filed and retained

in accordance with txisting Bureau instructions, and in sore

cases it is advisable to obtain a large metal cabinet into which

can be placed items and evidence which is obtained in connection

with the "special." This locked cabinet should, of course, be

located in the temporary CCO so that such items are available to

the Agents on the "special" rather than having to go into the

special room generally maintained by the office in question.

In connection with "special" assignments, it is well

to imnediately notify all offices to furnish at least three copies

of all reports, teletypes, airtels, memoranda, and so forth, in

order that an extra copy may be available for the sub-files if

occasion arises.

SETTING UP OF LEAD BOXES ON

SPECIAL ASSIGNENT CASES

In connection with a special assignment in a field

division, the official in charge of the special assignment

will generally designate a Special Agent to handle the leads.

The first thing that should be done is to obtain

about eight wooden or metal index card boxes, 14x5x10"; which

will contain 3'x5" index cards. The first box to be set up

should be a box containing guide cards and these guide cards

should contain the typewritten name of each Agent who is going

_...to work on the "special.". .

On a special assignment a number of Special Agents

will be brought in from other offices and, as a rule, a certain

number of Special Agents from the local office in which the

crime was committed will be assigned to work under the inspector

in charge or other Bureau official. At first, one generally

• is not acquainted with all personnel and it is a good idea to

prepare these guide cards by color, possibly type the name of

the Agents in on special assignment on a card which will have

a white background and say,. for example, the Agents assigned

to the local office will have a green background tab. The

person handling the leads will then readily know as to what

Agents are local Agents and as to what Agents are visiting,

which will greatly assist him at the conmencement of the case.

— 22

NV 5044 DocId: 32989526 Page 971

---

## Page 972

In addition, it the end of the guide cards should

be

set

up guides for the Resident Agents who from time to

• time

will be covering leads in connection with this "special."

This box, of course, containing these guide cards, should

be marked "Agents."

Another similar box should be set up containing

guide cards for the Bureau and all offices. These guide

cards should be filed alphabetically, with the Bureau

guide card at the front.

As it will be noted, the above two index boxes

relate to Special Agents and to offices, and into these

two boxes will be placed the lead cards, to be described

hereinafter, which are prepared for a Special Agent

covering a lead or for a particular office which has

been requested to cover a lead. In addition to these

two boxes, sometimes the individual handling this phase

of the investigation might desire to have two similar

extra boxes made; that is, one for the Special Agents

and one for the Bureau and field offices, in order

that a copy of the lead slip, after the lead has been

covered, can be placed behind the Agent's name or

behind the office; however, maintaining these two boxes

involves extra work and sometimes is not essential.

The two or three extra lead card boxes

should then have placed therein guide cards under

- 23 -

---

## Page 973

various headings, which will be explained in more detail

hereinaiter.

After the inspector or Bureau official handling

the case looks over each piece of correspondence, such as

teletypes, airtels, letters, memoranda, or reports, he

will generally make some notations thereon as to "leads,"

or other comments as to what he believes should be done

or not done and after he initials it, it is routed on to

the special Agent assigned to reviewing same to make up

leads.

For example, an airtel will come in from an

eastern office stating that someone there reported

JOHN BROWN as being a suspect inasmuch as JOHN BROWN

Is an ex-convict and lives in the same city where the

crime occurred. On this communication, for example, an

airtel, a notation is made, such as: "Make suspect lead

card." The conmunication is then marked for indexing

with blue pencil and such pertinent information will be

underlined, such as the suspect's name, possibly his

address or telephone number, license number of his car,

if given, and motor number of car, if given. If it is

known to whor the lead is going to be assigned, the second

copy should then contain the name of the Agent who will

get the lead and a notation is made thereon: "Lead slip

to follow. " If

there is any question as to the handling

of that lead, and so forth, there will be written opposite

- 24 -

INV 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 973

---

## Page 974

the name of the Agent a notation to see the particular

Special Agent assigning that lead.

The original of this communication, which will

contain possibly comments or notations of the inspector

or Bureau official handling the case, as well as the

blue markings, and so forth, should always be retained

in the investigative file and the second copy should be

charged out to the Agent who is to handle the lead. The

third copy, of course, can likewise be retained in the

investigative file unless some reason exists that the

third copy should be placed in one of the sub-files

previously discussed, and it

so, a notation is made on

- the original and copy of the effect that a copy has

been designated for a particular sub-file.

The communications, memoranda, and so forth,

after being properly marled for indexing, and so forth,

will then be picked up by the Chief Clerk handling the

special assignment and that party will serialize these

communications into volumes containing only 25 serials

apiece. As mentioned heretofore, these volumes will

then be taken by the other clerical employees and index

cards will be prepared, as related previously.

The Special Agent or individual handling the

leads will also several times a day take these particular

volumes and dictate lead cards.

For example, an Agent will pick up Volume V,

- 25 -

LNW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 974

---

## Page 975

"S. BROWN has copy above reflecting

Mrs. MABEL WHITE, 1000 Peach Street,

ants

City, phoned on a certain date and

believed above should be considered

-as suspect inasmuch-as he is ex-convict

and lives in vicinity where victim

worked or lived. Check office and

special case indices. Ascertain

whereabouts pertinent date. Show photo,

compare prints, handle as regular suspect."

After the stenographer types this lead, consisting

ot three copies, it is advisable to blockstamp either the

front or back of it and place the Agent's name to whom the

lead is assigned on all three copies. If one knows that a

certain Agent is to get the lead, he can dictate that to

the stenographer at the same time and she can type the

Agent's

name and date on the lead in addition to the

blockstamp.

When this lead is dictated, a notation is then

made on the original communication that this lead was

dictated and one can merely write the word "done" with

his initials and date after the notation:

"Make suspect

lead slip."

When these leads are returned by the stenographer,

the original, of course, should be placed in the

lead box

for "Agents" bchind the name of the Agent in question.

The second copy of this same lead is then routed

to the Agent who is to handle the lead or investigation.

One will still have a third copy of this lead and,

as mentioned above, there will be extra lead card boxes and

inasnuch as this lead relates to a particular suspect, an

index tab card should be nade on which will appear the name

of this suspect and that is filed in the lead box alpha-

betically and the third copy of the lead slip will be

placed behind that.

In other words, if an inquiry is made as to who

was handling a certain suspect, one can go to this box and

-toot. under the name of the person - suspect, and there will

be a copy of that lead slip in that section reflecting the

name of the Agent to whon assigred.

In some major cases

one may have many, many

suspects who have to be investigated and checked out and

there will be a number of these tab cards with the name

of the suspect appearing thereon.

As each "special" case develops, one may want

to have different projects or breakdowns. For example,

one may want to have a breakdown entitled "Crime Scene."

In regard to the crine scene invesiisation,

possibly ten igents uny be assigned to ii or in that area

and as these leads urs made, the original, as mentioned

above, is placed behind the Agent's nane, the second copy

is given to the Agent, and the third copy goes behind

the

section entitled "Crime Scene." By picking up these

• leads

behind the section "Crime Scene," one may readily note or

observe what Agents have assignments that relate to

that

particular matter.

For example, one may desire to set up a subsection

entitled "Hats," inasmuch as a hat may have been found at

the scene of the crime. Although one Agent may possibly

be assigned to handle and coordinate the hat project, still

there might be a hundred leads made for individuals to be

checked out who bought or owned similar hats. One can see

that as these leads are made up and assigned to say twenty...

Agents, the original lead slip is behind the Agent's name,

the second copy goes to him, and the third copy would go

behind the subsection "Hats."

Each special assignnent case presents its own

problems as to what subheadings have to be placed into

these lead box sections and the following are a few:

Victim's home affairs

Victim's business affairs

Victim's route men

Typewriter project

Paper project

Dodge project

Bloody car project

Terrain search project

By having these leads set forth above, one can

look into the one box for Agents and readily account for,

and observe, each-lead that is assigned-to that-particular-

Agent or what project he is handling or working on.

Each Special Agent working on the squad, of

course, will have the second copy of the lead slip and

• .

at any time he can be called to the desk and have his

leads compared and checked with the ones appearing behind

his name.

= ¿ i The thira copy, as mentioned above,

will be in

the various boxes under the various projects.

If possible, it is best to line up the suspects

and projects in alphabetical order; that is, the first

stib-card could be for a suspect named JOHN ABBOTT, the

next sub-card in bach of him could be MIkE BLAck, the

third sub-card would be "Crime Scene." In other words,

these

sections of the index boxes should be placed

alphabetically if possible.

By having the above type of setup, one can

readily find or know who is working on certain projects

or who is handling certain suspects.

When an Agent handles a lead, say, for example;

on

certain suspect, and he dictates, it is well to have

Instructions issued to have the Agent's lead card, which

Is the second copy,

marked by him that it is either covered

or done and have him place his initials in the blockstamp

and give it to the stenographer so it will accompany the

memorandum or stencil or cornunication: that he has prepared,

and when it cones back over the desk, that lead slip is then

noted. If it is narked "done" or "covered," the original

lead slip behind the Agent's name in the Agents' lead box

should then be removed.

If one has the extra box, described above, con-

taining the guide cards for Agents' names, this original

can then be placed in that bor, which can be referred to

as a "closed" box, behind-the Agent's name. If this box

is maintained, it gives a ready reference as to all leads

that have been assigned to an Agent while working on the

"special;" however, as a rule, it does not serve any other

purpose and sometimes is not used.

With the original lead slip being filed in the

box referred to above, one should then go to the other

lead box, under the name of the suspect, which will contain

the thiid copy of the lead slip. That lead slip can then

be destroyed and it should be replaced with the second copy

of the lead slip containing the Agent's initials and notation

that the lead was done.

Say, for example, one wants to note or obtain a

brief resume as to what was developed at the crime scene

area, one can refer to the index box and look at all of

- 31 -

IX 55044 DocId 32989526

## Page 980

the lead slips behind "Crime Scene," and if and when that

investigation is done, all of those lead slips should be

marked "done" or "covered" and have the Agent's initials

thereon, and by looking at this group of lead slips, one

will get a brief resume as to whom was talked to in that

area or what evidence was found, and so forth. Once in

a while one will ast as to what was the name of a certain

person interviewed down near the crime scene, and by

glancing through these closed lead slips, one can possibly

come up with the name as it will probably appear on one

of the leads.

As mentioned previously, one wiii also have a

lead box containing leads for other offices, which lead

box should have guide cards filed alphabetically. In

structions will have to be given to the stenographers

first that whenever they prepare a teletype, airtel,

or letter, they should prepare an original and one copy

of a lead slip for that office, which lead slip is pre-

pared in a similar manner to that prepared for leads

to Agents; however, in the upper left-hand corner instead

of having the name of the city or village, there sheuld

appear the name of the office which will be covering the

lead and not the name of a particular city in a field

division.

Say, for example, an Agent handling TOM BROWN

verified by nother office. He will dictate an airtel

setting forth his information and specific lead. The

stenographer, after being instructed, will automatically

prepare this lead slip with a little resume of the

intormation appearing thereon, and as that airtel comes

over the desk, and after being signed, the copies with

the lead slip will be routed on to the CCO handling the

special assignment; however, it is advisable to make a

notation in the lower left-hand corner, on the top of the

copies, for example, "NYC lead made." The lead slip is

not detached but goes along with the copies of the

correspondence, and in the CCO handling the special

project, alter that communication is serialized, the

serial number is placed on these two lead slips,

In pencil, and then the lead is sent back to the desk

and, of course, the original of the lead will be

placed behind the tab, for example, "New York," and

the second copy of the lead will be placed behind

the tab for that particular suspect in the lead box.

The Agent handling this suspect or dictating the

airtel does not need a copy of this lead for the

resson that he should be aware as to what he is doing

and has done regarding that suspect.

He also knows

that at any time he can come to the desk and look in

the index lead box and look behind the name of his

suspect and he will see copies of the various leads that

have been made in connection with that suspect and will

give him a bird's-eye view as to what leads are outstanding

in other offices regarding his suspect.

By having this office lead box, one can keep tab

on other offices to see that they are covering all leads

they have been instructed to handle, and if such leads are

delinquent, their attention can be called to same by

routing slip or other communication.

When a particular office covers a lead and

their communication. comes.over the desk. the original

lead slip behind the name of that office is then pulled

and it is advisable to make a notation thereon, for

example, "Done NYC airtel (certain date)." Inasmuch

as that lead makes reference to a certain suspect,

the guide card for the name of the suspect should be

referred to and the original lead slip can be placed

behind that guide card reflecting the investigation

was done.

-

As mentioned above, the remaining copy,

instead of being destroyed, can be placed in the

"closed" box for all offices, which will give one a

picture of what leads other offices have covered.

As will be noted from the above lead cards

and boxes, if someone is later on interested in re-

checking back on a particular project or suspect,

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page 982

## Page 983

he can look in the lead boxes, under the name of the suspect,

to determine what leads have been set out and, of course,

they will contain the serial number which he probably wants,

or else he can go to the regular indices which are maintained

in the CCO for the "special squad" and check those-indices,

which will give a resume as to the different communications.

Especially at the start of the investigation, many

leads. will be made, some of which may not need to be covered

later and many leads will be unassigned. An index box or

two will have to be obtained and proper breakdowns or sub-

headings placed therein, for example, "Suspects," "Dodge Car

Project, " 'Typewriter Project," and su iurth. The leads, as

they are typed, consisting of three copies, and which are

unassigned, will then be placed behind the respective sub-

headings, such as "Typewriter Project," "Hat Project," and

so forth. As investigation progresses, one can then look

in these lead boxes and see what

leads should be assigned

as they are filed behind the various subheadings.

As one knows, in a special assignment case more

important leads have to be handled at first, but some types

of leads cannot be handled until certain phases of other in-

vestigations have been completed, and if there are special

leads like this, they should be placed in a separate subheading,

properly marked and identified, to be given special attention

later on when an active or open investigation is nade.

In regard to lead cards or slips being retained for

a minimum of thirty days and thereafter being destroyed at

the discretion of the officer in charge of the investigation,

it is believed well to retain all such lead slips until the

case has actually been disposed of and closed, as oftentimes

reference is made to inquiries that were made many months

previously.

LAW ENFORCEMENT LIAISON

MAJOR CASE AND KIDNAPING TRAINING

In any major case, including kidnaping, close liaison would

be established with law enforcement agencies in the area where the crime

was committed. This liaison should include closest possible relationship

with state, county and city police, to insure that any information coming

to the attention of these agencies is obtained without delay.

To effect this coverage the inspector or official in charge of

the investigation will immediately assign Special Agents, probably on a

twenty-four hour a day basis, to the headquarters of the city police depart-

ment, the state police headquarters; and in a case which occurs in a rural county;

to the appropriate county sheriff's office.

Initial arrangements should be made through the head of •

the respective department. Ideally, some officer in each police agency

will be assigned to handle the case for his department. At the time of the

initial contact, the Agent should explain the necessity of his being immediately

advised of all information possibly related to the case. The Agent should

request that instructions be issued that information received should be

immediately brought to the Bureau Agent's attention. It should be specifically

requested that all communications, such as telephone calls and letters,

be referred to a particular officer's office and that all individuals calling

in person at the department be sent to that office so that the Agent will be

able to immediately obtain and furnish the information to the Number 1 Man

on the case.

## Page 986

. *6

It should be pointed out that the information desired should

include any reports pertaining to suspicious persons who could have committed

the offense. The officers should be requested to furnish the identity of any

individual and any information in their records concerning individuals in

their jurisdiction who have come to their attention and who might be

considered suspects. They should also be requested to furnish information

concerning missing persons or the disappearance of persons from the area

under suspicious circumstances, particularly when these occurred at the

time of the crime.

The officers should be alerted as to the items which might be

pertinent to the case and should be réquested to be on the lookout for and'

to furnish any information concerning abandoned automobiles, as well as

reports as to the location of clothing, guns, typewriters, jewelry or other

items found, which might be connected with the case. The officers should

be requested to immediately advise of any reports received of automobiles

containing bloodstains or of any unanswered suspicious reports pertaining

to bloodstains anywhere.

The officers should be requested to report murders and suicides,

and it should be pointed out that advice is particularly desired if a report

is received of a finding of a body that is possibly the victim. Arrangements

should be made to instruct all patrolmen, investigators and dispatchers so

that if a report of the finding of a body is received, the member receiving

this initial information should see to it that nothing is done to disturb

the area, and also insure the area is closely guarded and not disturbed.

The police should be asked to preserve the crime scene until Bureau Agents

arrive and make a thorough crime-scene search. In cases of sheriff's

offices or other rural police, it may be well to point out the advisability

of having available about 500 feet of rope for possible use in protecting

the area where the body is found.

There will be other special projects that the Agents will be

required to handle at the local law enforcement offices, which might include:

(1) Examination! of stolen car and stolen license reports

, Y

and a check to see if any of these stolen automobiles or

licenses could have been used in the crime. Particular

attention should be.given to cars stolen before the crime

and not yet located.

(2) A check may be required of Auto Theft Bureau records

for suspicious automobiles of a particular make or description

similar to automobiles observed in the vicinity of the crime

scene.

(3) A check of identification records of the various departments

would be required on all suspects developed during the investigation

of the various projects.

Under an ideal situation when the Bureau enters a major case,

the law enforcement body in whose area the offense occurred would state they

were taking no action independent of that being taken by the Bureau, that they

would turn all information over to the Bureau and would render all possible

assistance to the FBI.

In the Coors kidnaping case, however, the sheriff in whose

county the offense occurred, even though his department was conducting

little or no active investigation, furnished stories to the press, radio and

television on a daily basis, claiming to be making inquiries and to be

investigating clues. The sheriff himself was soon determined to be thoroughly

unreliable and uncooperative. On the other hand, his undersheriff, NA, and

Captain of Investigations, both competent and reliable officers, were

completely cooperative. Liaison was set up with the undersheriff and

Captain of Investigations, and no contact was had with the sheriff on official

matters.

+102739329-

The Agent should furnish no information concerning the case

to local officers other than such information as is necessary to carry out

a specific inquiry. In other words, information should be furnished only

on a "need-know" basis. Any inquiry by the local officers as to the status

of the investigation could be answered by replying that the case is still

under active investigation, but that any pertinent developments of interest to

local authorities will be made known to them.

It should be borne in mind that local law enforcement officers

and other local officials will possibly not afford proper secrecy to

information pertaining to major cases which have publicity appeal due to

the interest of these officers and officials in politics and in receiving

publicity. Experience has shown that each department has its chain of

command in such a way that subordinate officers must advise their

superiors of significant information. Then too, in a major case agreements

- 4-

## Page 989

will exist between the various agencies as to action to be taken. For instance,

if a body of a victim is located in a particular county, the coroner will

immediately advise the sheriff and the District Attorney. These local

officials most likely will immediately advise the press media.

From the above, it is apparent that all possible arrangements

must be made to protect the crime scene and as thorough an investigation

conducted of the area as possible prior to the arrival of the coroner,

Sheriff and District Attorney, as the entry of these individuals into the

case will preclude any further possibility of investigating without being

hampered by press and curiosity seekers.

When a major case süch as a kidnaping occurs, members of

the press will be stationed on a twenty-four hour a day basis at the

headquarters offices of the law enforcement agencies in the area. Any

Bureau Agent stationed at these headquarters must take every precaution

to be sure that no remark or action on his part provides a story prejudicial

to the best interests of the case.

Kidnapings, of course, are ordinarily cases of national interest,

therefore every local politician may desire to get into the picture in order

to enhance his political future. For instance, the Sheriff and District

Attorney of the county in which the kidnaping occurred will undoubtedly

attempt to drain every possible iota of publicity out of the kidnaping without

any consideration as to whether or not their seeking of publicity interferes

with the conduct and investigation of the case. For example, a kidnaping

may occur in one county and the remains of the victim may be found in a

second county. In such a case it becomes necessary to have arrangements

in both counties to handle any situation which might arise.

In the Coors case, the District Attorney and the Sheriff of -

the county in which the kidnaping occurred, as well as the county in which

the remains of the victim were found, were all publicity seekers. Under

the laws of the State of Colorado, when any human remains are discovered the

coroner of the county must be notified immediately. In COORNAP, a man

who was firing a pistol in the county discovered the clothes of the victim

and immediately reported his finding to the Denver Office. This, of course,

presented the problem as to whether or not the coroner of the county in

which the clothes were found should be notified. If so, it would be incumbent

on the coroner to immediately notify the District Attorney of his county.

This problem was resolved by maintaining absolute silence and taking

twenty-six Agents into the wooded area and making a thorough search for

skeletal remains. This silence was maintained for three days. Meanwhile,

such bones as were found were submitted to a pathoiogist who agreed to

maintain absolute silence and at the end of three days advised the Denver

Office that some of the bones which had been found were of human origin.

Upon this discovery it was believed it was absolutely essential the

coroner in whose county the remains had been found should be notified.

It was explained to the coroner that a search of the area which surrounded

a dump resulted in the location of numerous bones and that it was not until

-6 -

DocId: 32989526

Page 990

---

## Page 991

after examination by the pathologist, whose report had just been received, that

definite knowledge existed that human skeletal remains had been found.

This, of course, caused considerable consternation and angered

the Sheriff, District Attorney and coroner in the county in which the

remains were found. The Sheriff publicly announced he felt this was a most

uncooperative attitude on the part of the FBI. The District Attorney came

to the Denver Office and demanded all evidence in this case be turned over

to him, threatening the SAC with grand jury action, subpoenas and various

other types of threats; however, the evidence was not turned over to him.

At a later date he was given a list of the evidence which had been obtained

by the" Bureau." The Sheriff of the county in which the evidence was found

finally, after his first outburst, had nothing further to say in the matter;

however, the Sheriff of the county in which the kidnaping occurred made

a considerable amount of news by flying out to Seattle to pick up the subject

of the case who was returned to Denver by Bureau Agents. This Sheriff

then took his grievance to the press and finally ended up by stating his

office was no longer open to Agents of the Bureau.

This matter is being included in this write-up sirce it is very.

pertinent to anticipate in advance exactly how law enforcement officers

and agencies are to be handled in the event they become obstreperous.

It is also to be noted the District Attorney in both counties mentioned above,

were candidates for re-election and as a consequence tried to use this

case to enhance their chances for re-election; however, because of the

the case and because of the loud ravings of these individuals, both were

defeated for re-election.

In conclusion, it should again be pointed out that the primary

purpose of establishing an Agent at headquarters of police departments

or other law enforcement agencies at the time of a kidnaping or other major

case is to insure that any information received by these departments is

immediately routed to the FBI.

LIAL ON WITH THE TELEPHONE COMPANY

The immediate problem in setting up a tracing operation is to

determine the bounds within which it will be necessary to

operate. In

the

oors case, the special Agent in Charge of the Special squad

det rmined at the outset that no interruption of service or noise on

th coors' telephone line could be evident to any person telephoning

th residence.

The life of the Victim was in the balance. How do you

go about setting up a tracing operation under these conditions?

Here is how it was done in Denuer:

CONFERENCE WITH TELEPHONE COMPANY OFFICIALS

vic Original contact was maderwith the Chief Special. Agent of the

Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co. (IST & I CO.) on the day

the Bureau entered the case. This individual had a wide knowledge of

telephone procedures and was acquainted with key technical and

managerial personnel of the company. These people are the essential

ingredients for a successful tracing operation.

The Chief Special Agent called a meeting of key personnel to

map out a workable tracing arrangement. In attendance were.

1o Chief Special Agent

2. Supervising Service Foreman of the toll equipment section.

This foreman in Denuer is responsible for supervision of

all toll equipment including the Direct Distance Dialing (DDD)

equipment. His is a very technical type of position and his

knowledge of long distance circuits and procedures is almost

unlimited. The equipment under his supervision is valued at

NW 55044 DocId 32989526 Page 993

---

## Page 994

$15,000, 000. His 10ng distance equipment accounts for a

great portion of telephone company revenue.

3. Plant superintendent having responsibility for the area in

which the coors residence telephone was served.

40.

supervising Service Foreman of the telephone exchange from

which the coors residence was served.

5o District Traffic Superintendent who is responsible for all

Denver long distance operations.

6. Two sound trained FBI Special Agents.

The meeting was held at one of the local telephone exchanges

in the office of the Plant superintendent.. This was done to avert the

possibility of press notice. Our requirements for coverage of the

" 2147551-113857

+ 5999942

".."

Goors residence telephone were discussed in detail. Ways and means of

securing such coverage were left to the individuals most familiar with

each operation. None of the individuals were able to state specifically

at the meeting just exactly how the complete operation would be under-

taken but all left the meeting with a firm idea of the problems involved

and immediately began to develop a workable system of tracing the calls.

COORS RESIDENCE, NATIONAI 9-4455, MORRISON, COLORADO

The Coors residence was served from the Morrison, Colorado,

telephone exchange. Morrison is a suburb some fourteen miles from

Denver. The telephone exchange at Morrison is mornally unattended

except during daylight hours. The equipment in use at this exchange is

known as "step-by-step" equipment. This means simply, each time a

digit of the telephone number is dialed, the switching equipment "steps"

..2.

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 994

---

## Page 995

for each dial pulse until the connection is made.

A direct call to the coors residence telephone could be made

from any other telephone in the Morrison exchange (NAtional 9) by

dialing the number. The National 9 area consisted of the small town of

Morrison, several smaller mountain communities and twenty-eight

tsolated public telephone-paystationgthroughoutthismountainous-area.

It became necessary at this point to establish twenty-four hour

• day coverage at the local exchange so that supervisory telephone

company personnel could visually trace all local telephone calls to the

residence. The entire telephone exchange building was blacked out so that

no one would be aware that any activity was in progress within the

build ig. -

.....Long distance calls to Mornisany fand this included those from..

Denver) were routed over thirteen long distance operator trunks and

through Direct Distance Dialing equipment at the toll section of the

Denuer tele phone building.

'It was necessary that a means be found so that the superuisor

on duty at the exchange could be alerted of all calls going to the coors

residence telephone. This was accomplished by placing a "ringer" across

the coors telephone line. The "ringer" is merely a telephone bell

which rings in an identical manner to that of the bell on the telephone

at the coors residence. It has no effect on the telephone circuit.

When the "ringer rang, the supervisor on duty could determine

In a matter of seconds whether the call to the Coors residence was

coming from a local NAtional 9 telephone or whether it was an incoming

call by long distance.

## Page 996

If the cal was being made from a local number

wuthin his own

exchange, he could visually trace the call within a matter of seconds

and determine from what local area telephone the call was being made.

If the call was coming by long distance from denuer, he could

imm' diately determine on which of the thirteen trunks from Denver the

ca

Iwas coming in on.

This is the only tracing he could do.

Local calls were simple to trace. All equipment in the exchange

was contained in one small room.

Long distance calls were a different matter. The Morrison

supervisor needed to immediately notify the toll section at denver so

that tracing operations from that point could be started.

i=.

CENTRAI CONTROL POINT

GE

The tracing operation was controlled from the office of the

Supervising Service Foreman of the toll section at the Denuer main

telephone building. This office and associated equipment occupy an

entire floor of the main telephone building. Doors to this space can

be opened only by authorized personnel through use of a coded dialing

system. It is a key facility.

The office was eguipped with two toll tandem lines as well as

four local telephone lines: Denver had not converted to Direct Distance

Dialing (DDD) at the time the coors case begon, but the toll tandem

lines could do the same thing as DDD, only better. It might be well to

furnish a brief summary of DDD as this is necessary to explain now the

oll tandem operates and a toll tandem line is the key to the successful

.?..

operation of a tracing system such as was used.

- 4.

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 996

## Page 997

With DDD, to call the fBI in San Francisco from Denver, it is

rst necessary to dial 1l2. This serves to actuate the DDD equipment.

en it is necessary to dial 415, which places the call into the san

ancisco main toll center equipment.. Then it is necessary to dial

Londike 2-2155, the actual number of the san Francisco office.

As sooñ as this operation is completed, an operator comes on

the line to secure the number from which you are calling. This is for

billing purposes. As soon as she has done this, the call is put through

without any further action on the part of the calling party. (This is

KnOWn aS a CAMA operation, Customer Automatic lessage Accounting.)

some cities have a completely automatic system in which o11

dato necessary for billing purposes is punched on a tape and no operator

breaks in to secure the number of the calling party. I'his is known

BE AlA operaiions Automatic Message Accounting.)

The toll tandem cuts out one whole operation of DDD. To call

our San Francisco number, it is only necessary to pick up the tandem,

dial the area code of 415, plus the number of the san Francisco Office.

No operator comes on the line to secure the number as no toll charge

is necessary. It's almost like making a local call, except for the

extra three digits. The toll tondem line is used almost exclusively

by supervisory toll personnel to talk to other supervisory toll

personnel in distant cities, much as the ordinary individual dials

Jocal calls. This is truly an investigative aid, but to the telephone

company it is merely a means to secure instant communication to any

city in the United States.. Only three toll tandem lines were available

in the telephone building, tuo in the toll tandem supervisor's office:

- 5=

## Page 998

and the other in the office of the president of lS I & t co.

From the toll tandem office, the central control point of the

tracing operation, (except for local Morrison, Colorado, calls within

the NAtional 9 exchange), it became necessary to devise a system of

rapid communication between Denver and Morrison as all calls to Morrison

could appear at several different places in the main Denuer telephone

building.

Let us consider this communications problem:

When the Morrison exchange supervisor located a call coming to

the coors residence on one of the thirteen long distance trunks from

Denver, quick action had to

be taken at the Denver exchange to locate

the particular.cal while the calling party was still on the line,

utherwise no trace could be made of the call.

The only available means of communication from denuer to

Horrison was by way of one of the thirteen long distance lines, but

this wasn't fast enough. It meant lifting up a phone at Denver or.

Morrison and calling the other by long distance. Only two phones were

available at the Morrison exchange and during the time a call was being

received at the coors residence, the superuisor was much too busy

trying to trace the call to stop and get on the telephone.

The answer was the installation of a continuously operating

telephone circuit between the Denuer toll office and the Morrison

exchange through use of one of the thirteen long distance lines.

At the Morrison exchange, a telephone handset was mounted

in the center of the equipment room.

At the Denver toll office, a speaker telephone set was installed.

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page 998

## Page 999

A speaker telephone is the type used by many executives to.

free their hands when making telephone calls. It consists of a small

speaker and a built-in

microphone so that the user of such a set can

talk in a normal tone of voice and anyone in the room can hear the

incoming conversation over the speaker. No handset is used.

I'hus, when a call came to the coors residence over long distance

equipment from denver, the supervisor on duty at Morrison immediately

determined on which of the thirteen long distance trunks the call was

coming from and shouted the number of the trunk into the speaker phone

system to alert the supervisor on duty at Denuer.

The supervisor at the denver toll office then had to take prompt

action to trace the call. His problem was magnified somewhat because

each long

distance

call to the coors residence could originate in one.

of three ways and there was no way of telling which way was in use

until checks were made at various eguipment centers within the telephone

building. It was a matter similar to locating a fire in a building when

you don't know on which floor the fire is burning.

Originating points were as follows:

1. Ihrough a Denuer long distance operator. (Iwo floors

of equipment and operators and an overload long distance

exchange located at an east Denver exchange some five

miles away.)

2. Through terminal grade trunks from a number of cities in

Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico. (Located on one floor.)

3.

Through Direct Distance Dialing equipment.

Located adjacent to the toll tandem office.)

Each had its own separate problems of tracing and each will

•now be covered in some detail:

A. LONG DISTANCE OPERATOR CALLS

Telephone company craft employees were kept on duty twenty-four

hours a day in the equipment room at denver where the thirteen trunks

from Morrison, Colorado, originated. When a trace alert arrived from

Horrison to the toll tandem office, the craft employee was notified by

loud speaker to visually determine where a particular call was coming

from for example, is he was notified that a call was coming in on

Trunk ?, the craft employee went to trunk i where he could determine.

whether the call was coming from a Denuer long distance operator of from

a long distance operator in some distant city. He would immediately

relay this information back to the toll tandem supervisor's office. -

If the call originated from à Denver long distance operator,

the toll superuisor would call the three Denuer Chief Operators, each

responsible for a unit of long distance operators. Each Chief. Operator

would then unobtrusively walk down a line of long distance operators and

pick up all their long distance toll tickets, locate the one directed

to the coors residence and notify the toll superuisor where the call

was coming from as the originating telephone number appears on the

toll ticket..

It might be noted at this point that the picking up of toll

tickets by the chief Operator is a normal procedure but the timing in a

tracing operation is most important. Any lag would result in searching

through a greater number of toll tickets.

The Chief Operators were briefed as to what they were doing

but the many long distance operators were unoware that a tracing

---

## Page 1001

operation was in progress.

One small loophole existed in this system but it could not be

avoided other than by direct tracing of each call and this could not

be done in this case. Why? to make a direct trace, it is necessary

to "hold-up" or "slug" each circuit involved in the call, starting at the

called party and following it back to the originating point. This-would

very likely alert the calling party because of the clicks which would

be heard on the line every time a "slug" was inserted into the switching

mechanism. It would mean having telephone company employees on duty

twenty-four hours a day at each telephone exchange in the city of

Denuer and surrounding suburban areas. Each employee would have to be

able to communicate instantly with each other employee. A direct

trace can"be made only from one erchange to the next and a call may go

through many exchanges. A "slug" must be inserted at each. exchange

before you can go on to the next exchange. This takes time and man-

power of such magnitude that it is not feasible for any extended period

of time. The call can be traced only while the actual call is taking

place. As soon as the calling party hangs up, the trace

is lost

except to the points where the call has been "slugged."

The loophole mentioned was this: the calling party merely

had to give the long distance operator an incorrect number for the one

from which the call was actually being placed, but this in itself is

a risk for the calling party. An alert long distance operator can detect

that a wrong number is being given and will refuse to place the call

under such

circumstances. She might not check a call coming from

AComa 2-1234 if the calling party said he was calling from AComa 2-1235,

-9 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526

Page 10,01

---

## Page 1002

but if the calling party was.calling from BElmont 3-1234 and he said he

was calling from AComa 2-1234, he would not get away with it. Even in

the first example, the operator, if suspicious, could re-dial the

number AComa 2-1234 and if this line did not show a busy signal, the

ruse would not work. Even in the first example where a wrong number was

give,

we would still have the city the call came from if long distance

and at least the approximate ared if a local call. During the operation

of the tracing system, no incorrect numbers were noted and all were

traceable.

If the call originated from a distant city long distance

operator, the supervisor used the facilities of the toll tandem in

his office. He dialed the distant city Chief Operator, briefly

plained his problem, giving no more information than was necessary,

and asked the Chief Operator to collect all pending toll tickets and

locate the one directed to NAtional 9-1455 at Morrison, Colorado.

This is not an unusual procedure and the toll superuisor has a job

of such responsibility that a Chief Operator will not ordinarily

question his orders. In the few instances where a Chief Operator in a

distant city hesitated, the denuer toll supervisor was prepared to

call his counterpart toll supervisor in the distant city. Usually,

the mere statement that he was prepared to make such a call or that

he would call the Chief Special Agent or a Iraffic Superintendent

(the Chief Operator's boss) was enough to resolve the hesitation. The

cardinal principle here involved, is that a toll tandem superuisor

knows his way around, knows telephone company parlance and operating

procedure.

If he can't get the job done one way, he knows who to

•10 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526

Page .10

---

## Page 1003

contact to get the job done. As a result, no failures were involued

in obtaining the pertinent toll ticket in o minimum of time.

B. CALLS THROUGH TERMINAL GRADE TRUNKS

A terminal grade trunk is one by which a long distance operator

in a distant city can dial a number in-the-same manner as-a- 10ng

distance operator located in Denuer. Ihus, for example, a long distance

operator in Cheyenne, Wyoming, could plug into a Denuer terminal grade

trunk and place o call to Morrison, Colorado, in the same manner as a

Denver long distance operator. It is just an extension off the Denver

Jong distance board, although it covers a lot of miles. This did not

create much of a problem as the craft employee soon recognized that a

terminalgradetrunk wastbeing.used.andhe.potifjor.the.tobl.tandem...

superuicor who then placed a call to the Chief Operator in the distant

city and the same procedure was followed as outlined above.

-

C. DIRECT DISTANCE DIALING (DDD) EQUIPHENE

Then the Coors case occurred, Denuer was not equipped to

handle DDD calls but all the eguipment for this method of dialing was

installed in the toll office and the system of tracing calls which

went through this eguipment was developed by the superuising seruice

Foreman of the toll section and several of his toll superuisors. As

will be recalled, the supervising service Foremon of the toll section

.attended the original meeting of telephone company officials.

He returned to his office late in the afternoon, held over

several of his toll superuisors, and they all went to work on the problem.

By 3.00 Aolo, the systemwas completed, tested and placed into

operation. The ingenuity of this operation cannot be over-emphasized

odal -

## Page 1004

as it eventually saved countless hours of manpower and alerted toll

personnel in Denver that a call was proceeding to the coors residence

even before the Coors telephone rang.

Tracing became an instantañeous operation.

The technical aspects of this system are much too extensive

for review-at-this point, but in layman's language-the-following took

place:

The DDD equipment in Denuer is described as a 4A Crossbar System.

The crossbar switching system was developed by lestern Electric and the

Bell Telephone laboratories after years of research, but even when it

mas being installed a few years ago, it was obsolete because of newer

advancements in the electronic field.

• 7745-0

Each crossbar. office is.eguipped.with a machine.known.as a

Irouble Recorder. This machine helps the crossbar system to locate

all mechanical and electrical

malfunctions in the entire system..

If a trouble condition develops in one particular circuit,

the

crossbar system tries to route the call through another circuit,

and in most instances succeeds.

As soon as any malfunction occurs, the trouble recorder ejects

a punched card and an alarm bell rings. A trained craft employee needs

only to glance at the punched card to determine that a particular circuit

is not functioning properly and immediately proceed to make the necessary

repairs.

Any large told office prides itself in keeping the crossbar

equipment operating in a most efficient manner. In fact, each trouble

card ejected outs down their "Index" which to them is what statistics

are to the Bureau.

I2 -

NW 55044 DocId:32989526 Page •1004

---

## Page 1005

The tracing system developed used the trouble recorder machine

to trace the incoming calls. Every time a call went to the coors

residence or to eight other adjacent numbers, a trouble card was ejected.

This card would show the routing of the incoming call and a tracing

operating could be started even before the coors telephone rang.

The card was ejected because a trouble condition "trap" showing -

a continuity failure was placed on the first attempt to ring the coors

telephone. This is known as a "first trial failure."

But remember, when a failure occurs, the crossbor system

doesn't give up but makes a second trial attempting to place the call

by a different circuit. The "trap" was so set up that on the second

trial, the call to the coors residence was completed. The important

thing was that the essential routing instructions for a tracing

operation were punched into the trouble recorder card which had been

ejected on the first. trial.

The time lapse between "trials" is not great. It takes from

500 to 750 milliseconds to make the second trial so there is no

observable delay in the call. Note, however, that from the crossbar

-equipment the incoming call to the coors residence had to go through

the step-by-step equipment at Morrison, Colorado. Since it takes

call approximately ten seconds. to go through the step-by-step

equipment, we got a ten second running start on the tracing operation.

As to actual procedure, as soon as the trouble card dropped

in the crossbar equipment room, a craft employee determined the

routing instructions from which he could determine from what distant

city the call was being originated. He called the toil tandem

supervisor by inter-com. The supervisor placed a call to the chief

- 13-

NW 55044 DocId; 32989526 Page 1005

---

## Page 1006

Operator of the a stant city and asked her to pick up

the pertinent

• toll ticket. On almost all occasions, the calling number was known

before we knew whether the call was worthy of tracing of not.

As time went on, the trouble cards being dropped for our

of ration began to cut into the "Index" of the toll section to such

c, extent that permission was granted by officials of the company to

!iscount all the cards caused by our tracing activitiès.

As a matter of evidentiary nature, each trouble card was

filed away for. future reference. Craft employees marked each card with

the time, date. and their initials as well as the routing information.

A log was maintained in the toll tandem supervisor's office

by the toll supervisors, marking down the date, time, routing information

results of the trace and the fact that a discontinuance of the trace

was received.

These logs and cards assumed some importance later in the Coors

case when the sac noted that a call had been received from Atlantic City

during the early stages of the tracing operation at a time prior to the

discovery of Corbett's car near Atlantic City. Through quick checking

of the logs and cards, it was determined that this call had been placed

by a college friend of Mrs. Coors.

MODIFICATIONS MADE IN THE TRACING SYSTEM AS TIME PROGRESSED

As time went on, officials of the telephone compony became

somewhat alarmed at the added expense to them of continuing the

tracing operation.

Toll superuisors were on

duty twenty-four hours a day, seven

days a week. Under ordinary conditions, these supervisors

were not on

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 1006

---

## Page 1007

duty during weekeris, except when major trouble occurred or when

extensive revampi.g of the system was required. Additionally, these

supervisors are usually out inspecting equipment and directing the work

• of the craft employees in the equipment room. since one of the super

visors had to remain in the toll tandem supervisor's office at all

*res to-handle the tracing operation, it cut-down-on his-normal

ispervisory duties.

To alleviate this situation, a Special Agent of the telephone

company was assigned to handle the tracing operation during the day. If

any particular problem arose, one of the toll supervisors was not too

A sound trained FBI agent was on duty from 4:00 P.l. until the

"ear morning After familiarizing.hinself-with the operation he-was

able to handle the tracing operation during the occasional absences of

the toll supervisor. Week-end duty was handled on a voluntary basis

by the individual toll supervisors and all volunteered. Since they

were

paid, on a yearly salary basis, no overtime or premium pay was involved

insofar as the telephone company was concerned.

The big problem arose in justifying the use of a craft employee

in the equipment room twenty-four hours a day. His sole duty was to

determine on which Denver-Horrison trunk a particular call was on. He

could do nothing. else. His entire salary had no return to the telephone

company. Further, as a craft employee, he was entitled to premium pay

for working nights, special shifts and on weekends.

With the success of the tracing operation through use of the

trouble recorder system, a way was found to eliminate the craft

employee. Recall that all cails through the crossbar system were

- 15 -

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 1007

---

## Page 1008

automatically traced.through use of the trouble recorder card. Craft

employees were on duty twenty-four hours a day at the trouble recorder,

irrespective of out operation.

If all calls could somehow be routed through the crossbar system,

the craft employee making checks on the long distance operator calls and

the terminal grade operator call, could be eliminated: this-was-done.-

Each long distance operator in Denuer had access to the thirteen

trunts to Morrison, Colorado by which she could dial a NAtional 9 number

by plugging into an unused Morrison circuit and dialing the number

involved. This she did as a creature of habit when she had a call going

to Morrison.

She could just as easily plug into a crossbar. circuit and.

place

" her call through the crossbar system. so, the District Iraffic superir-

tendent authorized the "blacking out" of all these Morrison operator

trunk outlets. This became a matter of disabling each of these operating

circuits at each long distance operator position by removing the sleeve

from each circuit and placing plugs in the associated holes on the long

distance board. Each long distance operator was then instructed to

place her horrison calls through the crossbar circuits.

This left the terminal grade trunks of which there were 170

scattered throughout the Rocky Mountain area.

The terminal grade

trunks were the property of the long lines department of the American

Telephone and Telegraph Company and were a revenue making proposition

JOТAI&ICO.,

but not necessarily for Mountain States. The terminal

grade trunks would be made inoperative anyway as soon as Mountain States

changed over to DDD on April 23, 1960. The district Traffio super-

intendent authorized the

the end result

was that all calls to horrison, and conincidentally to

the Coors residence, were all routed through the crossbar system where

an automatic trace was available.

From that time on, the tracing system could be kept up

in efinitely without a great monetary loss to the telephone company

a ¿ it was so continued untiI March 14, 1960.

COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SAC OF THE SPECIAL

When the special squad was being organized, it became evident

that the telephone facilities of the Denuer Office would be taxed to

the utmost.

The criminal squad room of the Denver Office was vacated for

she special squad. The SAc's office was placed in the adjacent criminal

supervisor's office.

A call was placed to the IS I & I Co. Denver Metropolitan

equipment supervisor, a long time contact of the Denver office. He

immediately proceeded to the Denver Office with a crew of installers

to design an expanded telephone system for the office.

The criminal supervisor's office had a two button telephone

set with two incoming lines.

Each of these lines was brought out to

another two button telephone set so that the ASAc of the special could

listen to each call if necessary.

An additional telephone with a direct outside unlisted number

was installed so the sAc could make direct outside calls without going

through the office switchboard.

Another telephone was installed for

the sAC's secretary 2

• 17-

NW 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 1009

---

## Page 1010

A way had to be found to arrange instantaneous telephone

communication with the coors residence. This is where the Denuer-

Metropolitan Equipment supervisor's knowledge of telephone circuitry

came to the fore.

Thirteen telephone circuits existed from Denuer to Morrison.

One of these circuits was being used full time for the Inter-com system

between the Morrison telephone exchange and the denuer toll office.

None of the other lines could be released for our use as they were

a11 needed for long distance traffic.

To call the coors residence from the Denuer FBI Office it

was necessary to dial the operator, as on a regular long distance call

and delays occurred on every call.

The equipment supervisor recalled that a wealthy Denver

manufacturer had a summer home in the mountains, served by a leased

Jong distance line from Denuer through which his mountain mansion

could be dialed directly from Denuer.

The line was not in use during the winter months but because

of the owner's stature in the community, the line was never used for

any other purpose. The equipment supervisor promptly "borrowed" this

line and had it looped into the Morrison exchange thereby giving us

the direct long distance line from Denuer to Morrison via the

mountain mansion.

Then our equipment supervisor borrowed a technique which is

not used very freguently in telephone installations. It resembles

the old hand-cranked

country telephone set in

a sense except you

don't

need the hand crank. He installed a "ring-down" phone in the SAC's

- 18 -

## Page 1011

office and a companion "ring-down" phone in the coors residence at

Ноттізото

To communicate, all that was necessary was to lift up either

phon and the one on the other end of the line rang.

To complete the communications pioture, there were four incoming

I nes to the toll tandem supervisor's office, all dialable from Denuer.

So, we can now follow the action as it took place every time

an incoming call arrived at the coors residence in Morrison:

AS 800M

as the phone rang, the special Agent on duty at the

Coors residence was alerted to listen to his lagnecorder and record

the incoming conversation. If he could determine that the call was

legitimate and not worthy of tracing, he would lift up his "ring-down"

phone and aduise the sAc the trace was not necessary. The sAc would

then dial one of the numbers of the toll tandem office and aduise the

agent or the telephone company employee on duty that it was not

necessary to trace the particular call in progress.

To prevent any delay in case oll the lines to the toll tandem

office were busy (and this happened on occasion) a dispatcher radio

unit was installed in the toll tandem office so that the tracing operation

could be discontinued by calling on the Denver ill radio system using

•suitable pretext language.

This dispatcher unit was also used to communicate with Bureau

radio cars during the period of time when a number of pay telephone

locations were being covered. in the Denuer area.

A dispatcher unit was also installed at the Coors residerice

at Morrison in the event of a breakdown of telephone circuits.

SPECIALIZED COVERAGE:

PAY STATIONS IN THE NATIONAL 9 AREA

Early in the case it was obvious that a call could be placed

to the coors residence from any one of a number of pay telephones

Jocated in the NÄtional 9 exchange without going through an operator.

By checking telephone company records, it was found that

twenty-eight pay telephones existed in the National 9 exchange. Many

were located outside and some in very isolated places. These ranged,

according to telephone company records, from such places as:

"Inside booth at labor Bar, Main Street, Morrison, Colorado";

"Outside booth, inter-Canyon Fire Department, mounted

on telephone pole number 649, about three miles above

Tiny. Town at fender Junction, where you turn off to

Phillipsburg, Golorado";

-

"Outside booth, IS I & I CO. ball park, Morrison

Road, east edge of town about where you cross to go

to soda Lake, on Pole number 9-26."

A team of Agents visually observed each of these locations

through use of a telephone company truck and all locations were

pinpointed on a map in the Denuer office.

In addition, supervisors at the Morrison exchange marked

each of these telephone terminals for quick reference in the event

that a call was received from one of the booths.

MULTIPLE PAY STATIONS IN DENVER AREA

Recognizing that a call might be made from a crowded area in

Denver through a pay telephone, a survey was made of all locations in

## Page 1013

Denver where three or more pay stations eristed. This

through review of telephone company records.

seventeen locations were found where multiple pay stations

existed. For instance, the Denver Union Station had a total of twenty-

"i hit pay stations located in three different banks of booths.

Stapleton Air Field, the main Denver airport, had twenty-three

Ly telephones located in four different banks of booths.

DENVER TOLL, TICKET SURVEY

since the subject of the case might place a call to the coors

residence to give instructions for a payoff, and then place a long

distance: call to the location where the victim was being held, all toll

fichets on long distance calls made from Denver,

Colorado and some

suburban areas were photographed through use of a Recordok machine set

up in the main telephone company building.

Two agents were busy handling this operation as approximately

600, 000 toll tickets were photographed from february 13, 1960 through

March 1, 1960.

Toll tickets were picked up on a regular basis and processed

through the Recordak machine so that no delay would occur in trans-

ferring the toll tickets to the telephone company's accounting center

in Denver where the tickets. are sorted for billing purposes.

It is well to note here that unless the toll tickets are

photographed immediately before the accounting breakdown is made, the

tickets are sent to all parts of the country for billing purposes and

they are effectively lost forever insofar as obtaining data which

might later be of interest to the investigation.

CRANK CALLS

several crank calls were made to the coors residence during the

tracing operation period. We were successful in tracing these calls.

The Chief special Agent's Office was particularly helpful in these

in tances in furnishing us with long distance toll tickets placed by

te persons who made the crank calls.

Grank calls were made to the Victim's father's home in Golden,

calorado, where the Coors Brewery is located. These calls were usually

of short duration.

In one. instance, the caller stated he would call later the same

evening. The telephone company Chief Special Agent, a supervising

service. foreman and an FBI Agent attempted to make a direct trace when

the incoming call come in. The call uas traced back to a telephone.

exchange in lest Denver, but the call was of such short duration that

it "fell-off" before the trace could be completed. We did know that

the call was coming from a pay telephone in west Denuer on a particular

street and with sufficient manpower on the street, the caller probably

•could have been identified.

How do you say thanks to all the telephone company employees,

many of whom gave up their week ends to assist in covering this

essential operation?

While the sound troined agent working with telephone company

personnel is able to verbally express the appreciation of the whole

office and of the Bureau, letters of appreciation from the Director

are most effective.

Anyone visiting the Denver toll tandem office today will notice

- 22 -

a framed letter from the Director, addressed personally

the names of each foreman under his superuision uno so

Bureau.

A visit to the ojfice

of the Chief special Agent will reveal

3 framed photograph of the Director addressed to him personally.

The above two are exandles of ways in which the Bureau's

gratitude was expressed. Other such letters were directed to key

personnel of lS I & T Co., including the President. You can be

assured that these expressions of gratitude are treasured long after

the remembrance of sacrificed week ends have faded away.

The question now crises, is a similar situation arose today,

could the same job be done with DoD eguipment?

According to our now firmly established sources, it can be

done, but each future case will have its own individual problems.

The answer can be given by the telephone company personnel involved

when the specific problem is advanced.

The best advice that can be given is to locate the proper

Key personnel, particularly those responsible for the operation of the

toll tandem office,

set out the problem involued and let them arrive

at the proper method of handling the particular case.

The most significant information developed to date indicating

Philadelphia area.

The Philadelphia source identifies Angelo

Bruno, Philadelphia Top Hoodlum, as the current representative

of the

"commission" in that area.

This source also discusses Bruno

traveling to New York to receive

instructions from the

"commission."

Information recently received from a highly confidential source in

Newark indicates that Gerardo Catena, Newark Top Hoodlum, has been

placed on the

"commission" in the recent

past.

The New York source identifies Carlo Gambino as the

current chairman of the "commission," Indicating that he is occupying

this position in place of Vito Genovese, while Genovese is in prison.

The Chicago source previously indicated that Genovese appeared to

occupy the top position prior to his incarceration.

The New York

and Chicago sources have mentioned Albert Anastasia, deceased New

York hoodlum, as a former "commission" member, and the New York

source has identified Frank Costello, New York Top Hoodlum currently

In Federal Prison, as a former

"commission" member prior to his loss

of favor as an underworld power.

Both the Chicago and New York sources have used the term

"avugat" to denote a "commission" member; "avugat" is a shortened

version of the full Italian word "avvocato" which, literally

translated, means

"attorney."

Enlarging upon the "commission's" power and influence

regarding organized criminal activities throughout the country, the

New York source explained that there were two hoodlum leaders,

referred to as the

"boss" and the "underboss," in each major popu-

lation area throughout the country and in Canada, who are responsible

to the "commission" for activities in their respective areas. In

explaining this progression of authority, the source cited as an

in case of problems or disputes, with the

The Chicago source discussed Vito Genovese traveling

about the country in connection with a number of "promotions"

the organization, and mentioned frequent changes of the "boss" in

Philadelphia during a comparatively short period.

The Philadelphia

source furnished corresponding information concerning a change in

leadership in that area occasioned by the

"commission."

This information, made possible through the establishment

of these sources, has been

invaluable. in providing insight into the

• top echelon of organized crime in this country. However, as pointed

out above, there is an urgent need for amplifying information which

will reveal full details concerning the operations of these inter-

related organized criminal groups throughout the nation..

Our urgent need for new live sources strategically placed

in the upper echelons of organized crime is brought into clear focus

by the fact that no information regarding the

"commission" has been

reported by any live criminal source to date. This, of course,

suggests a problem of some delicacy in seeking information from

live informants, since we must avoid the danger of informants

"playing back"

information they may obtain through questions asked

them:

You are again reminded that the penetration and infiltration!

of organized criminal activity 1s a prime objective of the Bureau,

and to accomplish this it is necessary to give a renewed impetus to

the development of quality criminal informants.

We have learned through our experience in conducting

investigations in connection with the criminal

that the best source we could possibly obtain

would be a criminal n

Informant who is highly placed in organized crime.

The Bureau is therefore inaugurating the following program

in an effort to develop criminal informants of the type mentioned

above.

Effective immediately the following offices must designate

a squad of Special Agents to work exclusively on the development of

criminal informants who are in a position to furnish valuable

Information regarding cases currently under investigation in

connection with this program, and to furnish guality criminal

intelligence information: Chicago, Detroit,

Kansas. City, Las Vegas,

Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and

San

Francisco.

The selection of Agent personnel to participate in this

program is of vital importance.

The Agents selected must have

demonstrated in the past their ability in this field and should

--

be mature, aggressive, resourceful, and possess the necessary

knowledge of criminal activities in your area to intelligently

accomplish the objectives.

In addition to the above qualities an enthusiastic approach

to this program 1s a basic essential which must be evidenced by all

• Agents whom you designate to participate.

To insure the success of this program, it is necessary to

utilize Special Agents with the will and desire to employ new

approaches and means to secure the Bureau's goals.

It is your personal responsibility to select the Special

Agents to participate in the program and to advise the Bureau within

one week of their names.

SELECTION OF POTENTIAL INFORMANTS

Your selection of potential criminal informants in

connection with this program should be based upon a combination

These are cited only as examples of the types of individuals

who would be in a position to furnish the information required. You

are undoubtedly aware of other hoodlums, who for various reasons may

be susceptible to an approach.

The eleven offices participating in this program should

submit to the Bureau within one week the identities of hoodlums yoü

have selected for concentrated attention. Each office, with the

exception of the New York Office, should submit a minimum of five

names; the New York Office is to

submit a minimum of ten names.

SUGGESTED APPROACHES

To properly develop informants of this caliber, varied

approaches can and should be utilized, dependent upon the individual

under development. The following methods are being set forth as

possible guidelines.

Background Investigation

A penetrative investigation of each individual selected

as a target for development as an informant should be conducted

prior to any approach of the individual.

In many Instances this information will be available to

your office as a result of previous investigations. Do not overlook

possibilities of obtaining additional Information from your criminal

informants and sources.

Through these investigations you should determine back-

ground, marital status, girl friends, hobbies, personalities,

activities, et cetera of each individual selected for development.

Be alert to the possibility of utilizing as informants,

Individuals currently Incarcerated who were formerly associates

of Top. Hoodlums.. The offer of assistance to these individuals'

families could induce

their cooperation.

A review of all these facts should assist materially

in planning the development period.

Payments

The Bureau will authorize substantial remuneration for

Informants who can provide information concerning hoodlums who

have national stature. Payments in this instance will be made

for guality criminal intelligence information and you will not

be restricted in making payments to just those instances which

involve a substantive violation over which the Bureau has

jurisdiction.

siderate lace tara.

It Is apparent that hope for financial reward will not

.be a motivating force which would induce most selected targets for

development to cooperate; however, under certain circumstances

this could be a most effective means and should not be overlooked.

Compromising situations

It is imperative that full exploitation be made of

circumstances which place a potential informant in a position

where it would be advantageous to him to furnish information to

• the Bureau.

a. Prosecution

Awareness of an individual under development that he

1s liable to either Federal or State prosecution could be a

compelling reason for such an Individual to cooperate with the

Bureau.

b. Deportation

Fear of deportation is a fact. that could motivate many

of the selected targets for development to be susceptible to

development as informants. This may well be one of the effective

approaches which could be used against older top echelon hoodlums.

Confidential Basis

It should be made crystal clear to the individuals under

development in connection with this program that any information

furnished by them will be handled on a strictly confidential basis.

You should insure that no. dissemination is made of information

obtained from such sources unless the informant can be fully protected.

dion an into made on

In the implementation of this program, the Bureau's objective of

penetration and infiltration of the top echelon of organized criminal

activities and the continuous flow of quality criminal intelligence

iniormation should be constantly kept in mind.

This program presents a definite new challenge to the field

which to be met calls for new and untried methods and situations may

arise which will be evaluated by the Bureau based upon the realization

of the need for unusual and extreme methods. The offices participating

in this program must of necessity display the initiative and ingenuity

to provide the impetus to realize the Bureau's objective.

Every office is being advised of this program since in the

future it may be appropriate to expand it to include additional

offices.

All Offices instructed to designate a squad of Special

Agents to participate in this program should advise the Bureau

within thirty days of the progress made.

The Bureau will analyze the preliminary information

obtained and within a three months' period, a conference at

either Seat of Government or in the field will be held to evaluate

the progress made and to redirect the program as a result of the

experience gained to date.

These special assignments will not eliminate the

responsibilities of all Special Agents to fully participate in

the criminal informant program.

The NOI Is an all-Negro organization which was

originally organized in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan. Muhammad

claims to have been selected by Allah, the Supreme Being, to

lead the so-called Negro race out of slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an independent black nation in

the United States. Members following Muhammad's teaching and

his interpretation of the

• "Koran" believe there

thing as a Negro; that the so-called Negroes are slaves of the

white race, referred to as

"white devils,". in the United States;

and that the white race, because of its exploitation of the

so-called Negroes, must

and will be destroyed:in the approaching

"War of Armageddon."

In the past, officials and members of the NOI, in-

cluding Muhammad, have refused to register under the provisions

of the Selective Service Acts and have declared that members

owe no allegiance to the United States.

On May 5, 1958, the first source advised Muhammad had,

upon advice of legal counsel, tempered his personal statements

and instructions to his ministers concerning the principles of

his organization in order to avoid possible prosecution by the

Undieu States Government, however, he did not indivate any

fundamental changes in the teachings of his organization.

On May 17, 1961, a third source advised: Muhammad

had, early in July,

1958,

decided to de-emphasize the religious -

aspects of the teachings of Islam and to stress the economic

benefits to be derived by those Negroes who joined the NoI.

This policy change, according to Muhammad, would help him

followers and create more interest in his

programs.

source advised that the Progressive

Youth Organizing Committee (PYOC) was established at a national

socialist-oriented youth conference held in Chicago, Illinois,

RUSSKY GOLOS PUBLISHING CORPORATION

A source advised on April 27, 1961, that "Russky Golos"

is a Russian language newspaper which has consistently followed

the Communist Party (CP) line and supports the same issues as

he_CPUSA. It is published by the Russky Golos Publishing

corporation at 130 East Ioth Street, New York City. It was-in-

corporated in the State of New York on January 11, 1917.

The source said that "Russky Golos" was formerly the

in 1954, the "Russian Section" is no longer known as such, but

has been organized into Russian Cultural and Aid Society groups

which continue to support "Fussky Golos" financially and look on

"Russky Golos" as the organ of these groups.

The CPUSA and the IO have been designated by the

Attorney General of. the United States pursuant to Executive. Order

(B)': FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM -- The "open season"

enrollment period between the first and sixteenth inclusive of

October, 1961, will provide an opportunity for all eligible

employees. to change plans.f, they so desire. Also, during this

period an employee no previously elected not to enroll may registes

to enroll, provided he is otherwise eligible.

The Bureau has been advised by the Civil Service Com-

mission (CSC) that training sessions will be conducted by their

regional offices starting on or about August 15, 1961, for the

various Government field establishments in preparation for the

"open'

season."

This training will cover "open season" regulations,

plans and procedures; changes in Health Benefits plans and other

Items of interest to agency representatives with Health Benefits

responsibilities. You should assure that your representative or

representatives responsible for the supervision of this program

in your office are in attendance in order to be properly prepared

for the forthcoming

"open season. "

If not previously advised,..

It is suggested that you contact the appropriate CSC regional

office in order to be apprised of the date and location of the

training conference.

subscriber kits for maintaining records of medical

expenses required for claiming supplemental benefits are being

made available by Blue Cross-Blue

Shield for employees who are

enrolled in the Service Benefit Plan. These kits can be obtained

from the local Blue Cross-Blue Shield office and should be furnished

to employees presently enrolled in this plan. A supply of these

kits should be maintained for distribution, to new enrollees.

Similar kits have been made available to SAMBA members.

(C) TELEPHONES - SECURITY OF FBI TELEPHONE LINES - Individuals

having background as telephone men and electricians could be

a good source of information to individuals or organizations

engaged in subversive, criminal or racial activities 1f these

individuals or organizations choose

to use their training and

background in an attempt to monitor FBI telephone facilities.

Therefore, you are instructed to immediately review the

security procedures involving telephone lines used by your

office to insure that maximum security is maintained.

There is a present requirement that field office

telephone lines be checked quarterly and resident agency lines

annually.

These security checks should not be performed on

such a highly regular basis that a pattern is established as to

the time they are conducted. As you are aware, these checks

are a precautionary measure and cannot guarantee absolute

security of office and resident agency lines. Since these checks

guarantee security only at the time they are performed, personnel

should be most circumspect as to the nature of their conversation

over outside telephone lines.

It is noted that a security check of telephone lines

requires a review of confidential telephone company records and

physical observation of the Bureau telephone lines located with

the telephone company central office (a space accessible only

to telephone company employees), and it is necessary to have the

cooperation of the telephone company officials and craftsmen.

Careful consideration, therefore, should be given to the attitude

and background, particularly regarding security, racial and

criminal matters, of local telephone company employees contacted

In that these individuals are also in a position to assist any

person or group interested in tapping telephones.

(E) USE OF IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE INTERPRETERS --

In an effort to improve existing interpreting facilities avail-

able to the field, the Bureau has discussed with Immigration

type of interpreters used by. INS and whether or not its inter-

preters could periodically be used by the Bureau. INS has

available throughout the field, principally in larger cities,

a small staff of interpreters who are full-time employees of

INS.

Additionally, each local INS office maintains a roster of private

who can be used by INS on a contract basis in emergency

situations. The latter individuals are paid when necessary on an

identities of specific individuals capable of handling inter-

preting work and the Bureau could make its own arrangements

regarding the use of these individuals.

To implement its

offer of assistance in this regard, INS 1s sending appropriate

instructions to each INS field office.

As initially indicated, INS interpreting assistance,

as well as

that available locally

through other intelligence

agencies of the Government, previously approved, is to be used

only when Bureau personnel

qualified to handle interpreting

work or already established Bureau sources utilized

as

interpreters are not available or the expense of securing

one from another Bureau field division cannot be justified

by the routine nature of the particular interview involved.

Further, you are aware that outside interpreting assistance

is sought and utilized only in routine, nonsensitive,

exploratory interviews and,

, in these instances, if unresolved

questions developor the individual being interviewed begins

to produce sensitive data, the preliminary interview should

be gracefully terminated and steps taken to conduct a reinter-

view with qualified Bureau interpreting personnel.

In substance, thérefore, if a neea arises in your

office for an interpreter in a routine, nonsensitive investi-

gative matter and no previously established interpreting source

is readily available, you may consult the nearest local office

of INS and determine if the desired interpreting assistance

If the individual recommended by INS is not

an employee, his name should be checked through field office

through local informants and established sources,

credit and criminal checks made and Bureau indices checked.

If financial reimbursement to this individual will be required,

Bureau approval must be obtained. Once you have established

a satisfactory relationship with an individual interpreter

in this category, no further contact with INS concerning his

use is necessary.

In order that the Bureau might assess

, the potential

value of this step, each office should maintain statistical

data showing the number:of times INS employee-interpreters

are utilized by your office, the language involved, the number

of hours they expend on behalf of the Bureau, the number of

Interviews they participate in and any unusual or exceptional

No statistical data is necessary concerning

the nonemployee type. A letter containing requested statistical

data covering the last six months of 1961 should be submitted

to the Bureau by January 15, 1962. A second letter covering the

first six months of 1962 should be submitted by July 15, 1962.

(A) COMMUNICATIONS - MESSAGE PRIORITIES - ENCODED MESSAGES - DIS-

cretion, common sense and good judgment should be used in assigning

the priority "Urgent" to teletype and radio messages.

Assigning an

"Urgent" priority. to a message which does not require immediate

action serves only to delay the handling of messages which are -

actually of an urgent and important nature and require immediate

action.

The sending of a nonurgent matter in encoded form with

an "Urgent" priority is a serious mistake in judgment, especially

If It is sent when skeleton shifts are on duty after regular hours

or on weekends. Encoded communications cannot be read, evaluated,

or their real urgency determined until they are actually decoded.

The receipt at any office of a nonurgent communication in encoded

form bearing an "Urgent" priority may delay the decoding and delivery

to officials and supervisors of an urgent and important communication

received at the same time.

*P" " Lengthy encoded communications should not be sent to the

no action until the following Monday. Matters of this nature should

be transmitted by airtel, using airmail and special delivery where

Requests for visual aids have moderately increased as a

(D) REPORT WRITING = STREAMLINING - SECURITY REPORTS -- Reference

18 made to SAC Letter Number 61-31 (J) dated June 6, 1961.

Referenced SAC Letter authorized the utilization of:

narrative-type statements in security reports. It was pointed

out that this particular type reporting was susceptible to use

primarily in cases of extensive activity In subversive organizations.

A review of reports submitted subsequent to referenced

SAC Letter reveals that attempts are being made to utilize narrative-

type reporting in cases in which little subversive activity has

occurred.

In such Instances the reports must be detailed in order

to present as complete a picture as possible of the subject's

activities in order that a proper determination may be made with

respect to his security Index status.

Instances have been noted of attempts to weave into one

narrative statement information received from more than one source.

This practice is contrary to the instructions contained in referenced

SAe Letter.

In reporting that a subject has attended meetings of a

particular organization during a certain period of time, the number

of meetings must be specified.

When reporting a subject's attendance at a specific

affair, set forth not only the date of the activity but the date

the information was received.

Likewise, in utilizing a narrative

statement to report a subject's activities, you must specify the

period of time covered. Following identification of the source to

which the information in the narrative statement is attributed,

specify inclusive dates of the informant reports; for example, I-1

(July 1, 1960, to June 15, 1961).

I want to again stress the necessity for reporting in

detail all information tending to establish a person's knowleage

of the basic aims and purposes of the subversive organization with

which affillated, as well as all information tending to establish

that a subject holds revolutionary and/or anarchist beliefs.

(A) FBI SUGGESTION PROGRAM - A decline in the number of suggestions

submitted under the FBI Suggestion Program was experienced during

fiscal year 1961 when 700 suggestions were submitted in comparison

to 1870 during fiscal year 1960. Of the latter total 910 were sub-

mitted to the Suggestions Desk, while 900-were handled-by the various

employees' streamlining committees. SAC Letter 60-45 (G) dated 9/27/60

instructed that all suggestions were to be submitted directly to me

without consideration or recommendation by streamlining committees.

However, even limiting consideration to the 910 suggestions handled

by the Suggestions Desk in fiscal year 1960, there was still a decrease

of 210 suggestions in fiscal year 1961. In addition the percentage

of adoptions decreased from 35.66% to

31.4% and awards and estimated

savings from $900 to $641 and $78,888.73 to $22,284.67 respectively.

(C) TRAVEL CONTROLS - CUBA - Section 87D, page 33, Manual of

. Instructions, details the procedure to be followed concerning foreign

travel by subjects oi current or past security investigations anc

certain other individuals with subversive backgrounds.

A volume of

data concerning travel to Cuba by U. S. citizens and resident aliens

of the United States not previously of

security interest to us is

Current regulations, in effect since

i anuary 19, 1961, require that U.S. citizens possess valid passports

,pecifically endorsed to authorize travel to Cuba before departing

Resident aliens

must have authorization from

immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) before performing such

ravel. Section 1185, Title 8, U. S. Code, and Part 53, Title 22,

Code of Federal Regulations, are applicable and Section 1185 provides

penalties of not more than $5,000 fine or more than five years'

Imprisonment, or both, when illegal travel is performed by U. S.

citizens.

INs has authority to deny re-entry to resident aliens who

did not have specific authority to leave the United States for Cuba.

Existing instructions in Section 87D, Manual of Instructions,

still apply in cases where travelers to Cuba fall within the specified

categories.

In cases not covered by provisions therein the field

should, upon receipt of information indicating unauthorized travel

to Cuba has occurred, conduct sufficient investigation to positively

identify the individual involved, review indices, attempt to determine

reason for travel through available sources, and

furnish Bureau

memoranda suitable for dissemination under individual captions

containing the results thereof.

Copies of the memoranda should be

furnished INS locally in cases

involving resident aliens and

naturalized citizens.

All offices should remain alert for information

concerning violations but no investigation in addition to that

outlined above is desired without specific Bureau instructions.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

not be accepted or that two or more representatives will be accepted

from your office. In your letter listing your candidates, you must

specifically set forth the results of the reviews of your field

agencies.

I want to emphasize the fact that the Bureau is desirous

of accepting at the National Academy only those candidates who are

outstanding both as to personal appearance and ability. The weight

standards for National Academy applicants are the same as for our

own personnel. Applicants must be within the desirable weight limits

as- set-forth on form FD-300..

You are again reminded that the fingerprints of National

: Academy applicants are to be submitted

at the time the results of

the formal interview are forwarded to the Bureau. You should make

a notation on the fingerprint card that the fingerprints are thosè

of a National Academy applicant.. The card should be forwarded to

attention to the

selection of candidates for attendance at the

CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES

A source advised on June 11, 1961, that a meeting of the

National Executive Committee (NEC), Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), was

held on June 10, 1961, at Communist Party headquarters, 23 West 26th

Street, New York, New York. According to the source,

the main topic

of discussion at

this meeting was the Communist Party's plans in

regard to combating the June 5, 1961, decision of the United States

Supreme Court, requiring the Communist Party to register with the

Attorney General of the United States as a communist-action

zation pursuant to the provisions of the Subversive Activities Control

Act of 1950, and the Court's decision of the same date upholding the

Apxil 21, 1955, conviction of Junius Scales under the Smith Act •

provision covering membership in the Communisü Fariy. This source

further advised that during this discussion a special Communist Party

defense committee was formed and it was decided that this committee

would have an office, which would be managed by Miriam Friedlander

who according to the source is a member of the CPUSA National

Committee.

Another source advised on June 14, 1961, that at a meeting

of the CPUSA National Board and invited guests held on that date at

Communist Party headquarters, New York City, It was announced that

the Communist Party defense committee would have an office at 22 Fast

17th Street, New York, New York, under the name of the Citizens

Committee for Constitutional Liberties (CCFCL) •

A thira source advised on July 20, 1901, that at a meeting

of the Communist Party defense committee held on that date at

Communist Party headquarters, New York City, the purpose and

scope

of the CCFCL was discussed.

It was stated that this committee has

been set up to serve as a national coordinator and service center

for every effort being made by whatever source to repeal the McCarran

and Smith Acts. In addition it has been set up to reverse the

Supreme Court's decision of June 5, 1961, or secure an indefinite

stay of any enforcement of the law by the Department of Justice.

(H) CHINESE COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES -- The Manual

of Instructions, Section 105 E, sets forth current Bureau instructions

regarding investigations of Chinese entering U.S. as citizens or

permanent resident aliens ino were 17 years of age or older at the

time they departed Communist China.

Arrangements are now in effect whereby we can cover a

third group,

namely, those who enter the U. S. on student visas.

division covering visa recipient's destination, together with two

copies of legal Attache, lokyo, letter which includes appropriate

instructions regarding investigation.

It is important to keep in mind the objectives of Bureau

programs regarding individuals who have formerly resided in Communist

China.

Purposes of our investigations are to identify Chinese

Communist Intelligence agents, obtain Intelligence information of

Interest to Bureau and other Government agencies: develop informants

and double agents, and acquaint reputable Chinese with Bureau's

responsibilities and jurisdiction with regard to the internal security

of the United States, thus effecting a broad over-all coverage

consisting of individuals ready and willing to assist the Bursau

in matters pertaining to Chinese Communist regime.

Recently, Information was received from a confidenial

source abroad of a new Chinese Communist method to surreptitiously

infiltrate target areas.

This operation is called "Detouring

Tactics" and consists of sending espionage agents by indiress

routes to their ultimate destinations. -Such agents-reported

leave Communist China at Hong Kong, British Crown Colony, ana

proceed to transit areas such as Singapore, Malaya, Burma and

Indonesia. The intelligence agents are under Instructions io

find employment in Hong Kong as teachers in order to establisa

a reputation for respectability prior to continuing to various

transit areas en route to their ultimate destination.

It is incumbent upon all personnel engaged in security

investigations to be fully aware of the grave responsibility si

the Bureau in the area of Chinese

security matters. SAC Lettess 58-72 (L)

and 58-81 (J) advised the Chinese Communists had approved a cecision

to expand intelligence operations particularly in the U.S. Although

. we have received no indication to date of any organized Chinese

Communist Intelligence activity in the U.S.,

wa must assume that

Chinese Communists are actively pursuing their intention of exentually

carrying out organized intelligence activities in this country.

Importance of developing sufficient informant and source covezage in

order that such activity will be promptly brought to our attention is

obvious.

In all probability, the greatest handicap to Chinese

communist Intelligence activities in the U.S. is the absence of

a legal establishment in U.S. or adjacent areas. We must assume

that the Chinese Communists recognize this handicap and are endeavoring

to overcome the inherent difficulties resulting from this situation.

Obviously, if the Chinese Communists can establish a diplomatic post

In the U.S. such as a delegation to the UN, they will then de in a

position to initiate intelligence operations. However, we must not

overlook possibility that Chinese Communists, failing

to estaslish

diplomatic establishment in the U.S., may work through estazlishments

set up in the future in Latin America or possibly even Canada.

It 15,

therefore, vitally important that the investigations we are currently

conducting in the Chinese security field be pursued with entrusiasm,

Imagination and a determination to accomplish Bureau objectires.

an SAC intended to present demonstrations on a Composite Picture

The Bureau has carefully evaluated

Composite Picture Identification Systems and has neither endorsed

nor adopted any such system for identification purposes in

-TO) BOY-SCOUTS OF AMERICA:- GOOPERATION WITH -- The Boy Scouts,

-

groups, and in one instance, a Field Office has been requested

to serve as a sponsor of a group interested in law enforcement

work.,

While the Bureau is in accord with the aims of this

to officially sponsor any Boy Scout group. Should you be

approached regarding this program, you may offer full cooperation

in the nature of providing lectures, showing movies or slides,

(C) : CRIMINAL: INFORMANT PROGRAM -- I have noted during the last

six months that the number of potential criminal informants

(PCIs) has decreased approximately eight per cent over the

preceding six-month period. I have also noted thai during this

same period the number of Agent days being used in the develop-

ment of informants has decreased over five per cent. These

are unhealthy conditions. Rise in erime, new legislation, and

added emphasis on organized

crime make it necessary that

our

criminal informant coverage be increased proportionally. An

insufficient number of individuals under development as

potential criminal informants can only result in the future

deterioration of our criminal informant coverage.

It is incumbent on every Agent engaged in criminal

investigations to actively participate in this program.

Individuals should be selected for development who have the

potential as quality informants. Every consideration should

be given to the development of gamolers, bookmakers, and

individuals who have definite ties with

the criminal underworld.

While these individuals are more difficult to cultivate as

"Informants, the resulis in the long run will ve much greater.

Individuals under development should be contacted frequently

and when they agree to cooperate should be given definite

assignments.

You should advise the Bureau within 10 days of the

receipt of this letter what action you are taking to improve

the criminal informant program in your office.

(A). OVERTIME -- I have noted with concern the increased amount

of overtime being performed by some field investigative person-

nel and I firmly believe the overtime could be materially

reduced If field

supervisory personnel would see to it that

such overtime as is necessary in the type of work handled by

the Bureau

• is equitably shared by all agents.

-.-

It has been noted that in some offices the daily

overtime of some agents exceeds three hours per day, whereas

other agents in the same offices render a much less

average

overtime.

If all agents were required to share the work load,

the average would drop accordingly.

I want all overtime reduced to an absolute minimum,

consistent with our responsibilities. At the same time, I feel

very strongly that sucr overtime as is necessary should be

shared equitably by all investigative personnel.

RE: RADIO FREQUENCY MICROPHONE-

TELEPHONE DEVICE -(RFMT)

No Number SAC Letter V, Series 1952, dated July 14, 1952,

a vised that the FBI Laboratory developed an instrument which imposes

¿ radio frequency on a telephone line and converts the telephone

nstrument into a microphone without entering the premises where

he telephone is located.

You were instructed to admonish your

ecurity Supervisors and

Sound-Trained Agents that this technique

has been classified "Top Secret" and that it should not be dis-

cussed with other than Agent personnel in these two categories.

The device has recently been reclassified as "Secret."

It will, therefore, not be necessary to continue the former practice

of keeping this device in the personal custody of an Agent at all

times when it is not stored in an approved field office space.

Henceforth, when the device is not operated under the personal

custody or

supervision of an Agent, it may be placed in a steel

cabinet which cabinet is equipped with a steel lockbar and

changeable three-number, manipulation-proof, combination dial-type

padlock.

The cabinet must be bolted or otherwise securely affixed

to the floor. of a closet or equally secluded space.

The closet

or secluded space must not have a window of other similar opening

and must be equipped with a door that can be securely locked with

a cylinder-type lock having no less than five pins with all the

keys to the lock being under the exclusive control of Bureau

personnel.

The closet or secluded space must be in an apartment

or area under the exclusive control of the Bureau and arranged

so that equipment servicing can be performed at any time during

the day or night without jeopardizing. the security of the instal-

lation.

The doors to the closet and all doors and windows in

the controlled space must be equipped with a fail-sare type alarm

device that will alert monitoring personnel to unauthorized entry.

This technique will operate successfully only under

certain conditions. It will be necessary that a detailed survey

of the telephone company subscriber equipment and telephone cable

facilities serving the subscriber be made in each instance prior

to installation of the equipment. This survey should be forwarded

to the Bureau, attention FBI Laboratory, for review. If an

Installation appears feasible, a specially trained technician from

the Laboratory or from

key points in the field will be sent to

make the installation.

IN 55044 DocId 32989526 Page 1069

## Page 1070

Use of this equipment will be approved only on a most

selective basis. It will be necessary, therefore, for all

requests to use

the device to be supported by adequate information

reflecting the essential need to obtain this coverage and the

reasons why such coverage is not feasible by other means. All

communications concerning-this equipment-should-be captioned

"RFMT" and transmitted as

The use of RFMT in the unattended manner described

above will permit running 1t into a central plant for monitoring.

It Is recognized that the monitoring of this and other types

of microphone surveillances at a central point will result in

a saving of man power to the extent that it will release any

men who are otherwise on equipment. guard duty when the subject

1s inactive.

However, in general,

this saving will be at the

cost of some loss of intelligence because of the loss of

Intelligibility inherent in running the wires over a longer

distance.

There is, of course, no saving in man power during

periods when the subject is active as there is no method which

will rellably signal the presence of a conversation in the

microphone target area and it 1s, therefore, imperative that

the individual microphone surveillances be separately manned

during the periods when the subjects are active.

contrast with the case of telephone surveillances where there

are technical differences which permit us to have a signalling

device to reliably indicate the presence of conversations so

that monitoring personnel can restrict their attention to

those lines which are active and thus can be reduced to a

minimum consistent with the volume of traffic.

I will hold each SAC personally responsible for the

security of RFMT equipment assigned his office and for adequately

covering each microphone and telephone surveillance operating

within the field office territory.

the following instructions:

"1) All Department of Justice personnel who are

authorized

to carry arms and who have them on their person

while travelling by air should present proper credentials to

the ticket agent or flight attendant when boarding the air-

compromise the success of their mission:

"2) When it is not feasible to inform the carrier

that they are carrying weapons, Department of Justice personnel

must act with the utmost discretion to avoid giving cause

for alarm to air carrier personnel or their fellow passengers."

resources and to accomplish savings.

The areas of interest involved.

are management and budgetary procedures, personnel policies,

-

recruitment, office space use, procurement activities, public intor-

mation duties, natural resources development, protection of equal

rights, urban

development activities; manpower utilization, etc.

In accordance with the authority granted by the Statute,

the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) has issued Special Civil Air

Regulation No. SR-448A, which in part states as follows:

"Except for employees or officials of municipal,

State, or Federal Governments who are authorized

or required to carry arms, and except for those

crewmembers and such other persons as may be

authorized by an air carrier; no person, while

aboard an aircraft being operated by an

air

carrier in air transportation, shall carry on

or about his person a deadly or dangerous

weapon, either concealed or unconcealed."

In effect, the FAA has granted the air carrier the right

to determine who shall be permitted to carry concealed

weapons

aboard aircraft.

Whereas. SR-448A is considerably broader than.

Subsection (1), Section 1472, Title 49, since it covers uncon-

cealed weapons, the Statute limits violations within FBI juris-.

diction to concealed, deadly or dangerous weapons.

In view of the provisions of Special Civil'Air

highly important nature that it is possible its improper use could

prove embarrassing to the Bureau.

Any such information noted should

be promptly called to the Bureau's attention under the caption of the

subject matter involved, together with observations and recommendations

as to what steps have been or should be taken to correct the situation.

The above-mentioned summaries are not to be confused with military

various military intelligence agencies.

Each Special Agent in Charge must advise the Bureau by

February 27, 1962, the following information: (1) the arrangements

he has made to obtain copies of all the above-described intelligence

summaries issued by the local military intelligence agencies covering

the region in which his office is located; (2) the administrative

(I) STATUS OF INCARCERATED NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS -- There are

currently incarcerated in Federal penal institutions a number of

notorious criminals, sentenced as a result of prosecution, in

whom the Bureau has had an interest.

By reason of their criminal

conduct, the identity of these notorious criminals is well known

to the general public and any action concerning their-application

for pardon or release results in considerable nationwide publicity.

Accordingly,

those offices having Federal penal

institutions located within their territory must insure that

through established liaison with penal officials the Bureau

will be advised of any. change in status concerning incarcerated

notorious criminals.

The Bureau should be advised

of any

contemplated action such as proposed or actual parole, release

from confinement or transfer from one institution to another.

RE :

MICROPHONE INSTALLATIONS -

Penetration of

a common wall between two buildings or

etween two rooms within the same building for the purpose of

establishing a microphone surveillance is a well-established

echnique.

Where physical conditions are such that access can

,e had to a common

wall of the target area, this technique must

be thoroughly explored and given consideration as a means of

securing desired microphone coverage.

Common wall penetration

1s particularly adaptable to those conditions where access to an

area to be afforded microphone coverage is not possible or where

peculiar security problems preclude the

use of more direct methods

available for installation of concealed

microphones.

No survey

made for the purpose of determining feasibility of installing

a concealed microphone can be considered complete until the

possibility of utilization of this technique has been fully.

explored.

Careful analysis of each condition ercountered will

reveal that in most instances penetration of a common wall can

be achieved without benefit of

specialized tools or sophisticated

drilling equipment.

The particular approach and solution to each

Individual common wall penetration problem will depend

largely

upon the ingenuity and

fortitude of the individuals making the

microphone installation.

In some situations, due to the nature

of materials used in wall construction, thickness of walls or

unusual security problems the need lor specialized equipment

to facilitate wall penetration may be indicated. Should a

survey for microphone installation reveal that the latter

condition exists, you should submit specific details to the

Bureau, attention of the Laboratory.

Analysis of details may

enable

the Laboratory to supply you with drilling tools or

•(C) IDENTIFICATION MATTERS - LATENT FINGERPRINT MATTERS - The

following devices and materials avallable on the market and

advertised for use in connection with developing and recording

latent-fingerprints

have been evaluated in the Identification

rivision.

The results are being furnished for information of

•Il Agents and should be of particular interest to personnel

nandling police schools:

"ID Fingerprint Porder" (Spray Powder)

This is essentially a fingerprint powder

• packaged in

an aerosol can similar to those used for household insecticides,

the powder being blown onto the

surface.

The entire surface is

coated and then brushed to reveal the latent prints. The gray

powder tested compared favorably with ordinary gray powder.

The black powder does not produce as good a visual contrast as

ordinary black powder.

The sole advantage noted was its rapid

application to large areas.

Disadvantages are the danger of

overcoating; powder sometimes issues in clumps or drops which

will not brush.off;

powder settles on everything in an eight-

to ten-foot radius

in inside use; and would obviously be more

expensive than regular powder to use.

"Magna Brush"

This is a device for applying magnetic fingerprint

powder with a magnetic pencil instead of a brush.

The pencil

comes in a kit with four small bottles of powder. It cannot

be used on iron or steel and due to the manner of application

Its use would be limited to small areas.

Tests show that it

will not perform any better than ordinary powders.

Application of Fingerprint Powder with Cotton

When exceptionally large surfaces are to be examined,

the application of fingerprint powder by means of a wad of cotton

A hanâful of cotton (obtainable in one pound

rolls should be torn from a roll so that it has a ragged wispy

This is used in the manner of a fingerprint brush by

dipping the wad of cotton into a layer of fingerprint powder

which has been spread out on paper and then dusting the powder

No pressure is to be exerted on the cotton

This information does not alter the long-standing

prohibition against wrapping latent-bearing surfaces in cotton

or cloth for shipment.

Etching Latent Prints on Glass with Hydrofluoric Acid

• This process requires specially constructed equipment

and a laboratory hood to dispose of escaping vapor.

A rather

detailed experimental report on this method shows that its

success is dependent on the type of glass, the rate of etching

1s difficult to predict or control, requires two to six hours'

exposure to acid vapor, and the results at best are not better

than those achieved by

the use of photography or fingerprint

powder. This is a laboratory novelty.

"Foto-Focuser"

This is a metal attachment for fastening to the lens of

a 4 x, 5 Inch "Graphic" camera to photograph latent prints natural

as is done with the fingerprint camoru.

With the bellows

properly adjusted, a latent print is in correct focus when it is

flush with the end of the "Focuser.

It has been suggested

that

this device would make the fingerprint camera unnecessary.

"Graphic"

camera with the

"Focuser"

does not, of course, equal

the fingerprint canera in simplicity and ease of operation.

Some of the disadvantages found in the use of this device are

constant slippage of the track lock when pressure is applied

?. to

hold the camera against a latent print, the obscuring of a

sizable margin of the negative by the edges of the

excessive length and weight of the camera unit--21 1/2 inches

compared to 12 inches and 6 pounds for the finger-

print camera; exposures are all flash shots with over-exposure

probable if made in ordinary room illumination or brighter light;

extra expense of larger film and flash bulbs.

Possible Adaptation of Polaroid Camera to Fingerprint Work

Polaroid photographs do not show the sharp detail

obtainable by conventional photographic methods. Test shots of

Inked fingerprints made with this camera do not show good ridge

definition.

DEPOSITORY THEFTS -- In the past, United States Attorneys

as to whether a theft from

This divergency

of opinion often stemmed from the crucial question of whether

deposits so made were within the care, custody and control of

contractual relationship existing between the depositor and

"The bank?...

-....

United States Attorney's Bulletin, Volume 10, Number 6,

dated March 23, 1962, states that, though the issue is not free

from doubt in that there have been no test cases in the higher

courts, thefts from bank night depositories are a violation of the

statute regardless of the contractual relationship between the

bank and the depositor.

The view expressed resolves the question

of cáre, custody and control with the comment that a bailment

relationship is established between the depositor and the bank at

the time the deposit is made.

The element of notice to the bank,

necessary for this bailment, is presumed since the bank in

providing the night depository facility invites its use.

- tenance of assignmeni varus is brought to the attention of all

offices for their information and use wherever practical.

Following preparation of the monthly administrative

report:

(a) Assignment cards of cases that will remain current

at the end of the month should be filed in accordance with

present procedures.

(b) Assignment cards of cases that will be delinquent

at the end of the month will be filed in the same manner, except

that a divider will be placed between them and the current cases.

In this fashion the assignment card box will then con-

sist of two separate parts and the cases that will be delinquent

can be readily differentiated from those that will be current.

This will allow delinquency lists to be prepared early in the

month thus giving Agents earlier notice to clear these cases of

their delinquent status. Throughout the month as a delinquent

case is posted,

the "delinquent"

the assignment card will be transferred from

section to the appropriate place in the "current"

section.

(D) SUPPLIES - PURCHASES FROM GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

RETAIL STORES -- The General Services Administration (GSA) has

opened Interagency Retail Stores in selected cities throughout

the continental United States.

These are self-service stores

stocking approximately 1,200 administrative supply items and some

standard forms.

These retail stores do not in any way replace

regular agency requirements which are met through submission of

purchase orders

at regular intervals. The retail stores are

primarily to meet emergency needs for standard supply items

which otherwise might be purchased in the open market at much

higher prices.

The few retail stores now in operation have proven

very successful in effecting important economies throughout the

Government. The opening of more such stores nay be expected in

the near future. Should GSA inquire of your office as to the

Interest of the Bureau in these stores, to determine the feasibility

of setting up a score to serve Government needs in your locality,

you should advise them that the Bureau would participate to the

degree that emergency purchases only would be made in this manner.

The retäil stores operate in much the same manner as a

self-service supermarket. Using a charge-plate, for identification

and billing, the vurchaser will select items required, exit past

checkout clerk who will register the cost of each item purchased.

In the event retail stores are opened in your GSA region,

your office would be advised by iSA direct, together with instruc-

tions regarding the obtaining of the charge-plate. The Bureau

must insist that the charge-plate issued be used only for identifi-

cation, not for charging items. Cash payment from your imprest

fund is authorized.

Purchases made in this manner should be re-

stricted to emergency requirements. The submission of quarterly

requirements to the Bureau, through the purchase order forms, remains

unchanged.

(E) SOLAR RESEARCH CORPORATION - 3200 N.E. I2TH AVENUE - OAKLAND

PARK, FLORIDA - JACK NORMAN HOLCOMB, PRESIDENT -- Solar Research

Corporation advertises itself as a manufacturer of "special security

and intelligence devices.

Principal items of equipment are those

used for concealed listening devices (bugs), wire tapping and

recording, most of which have been displayed to the Bureau.

Holcomb advises company will sell only to duly constituted

enforcement agencies on presentation of official orders and pay-

ment vouchers.

He states the company intends to hold bugging and

wire-tapping school for selected police officers in the Spring of

1962. He claims his considerable experience is the basis of material

used to prepare detailed, illustrated manuals on how to install,

operate and record bugs and wire taps with the company's equipment.

He has solicited, the Bureau's opinion of Solar equipment

and whether its production and sale to police agencies would interfere

The Bureau has advised him it expresses no

opinion on merit of equipment, does not endorse or recommend any

and in no way indicates to any

organization what products should or should not be produced.

Holcomb has been instructed that neither he nor his company is

to indicate the Bureau is interested in Solar products nor are

they to use the Bureau's name to promote sales of their equipment.

In addition to his own admission, Bureau records show

that in 1955 Holcomb was acquitted by a Los Angeles County jury

on charges of wire tapping in a divorce case for lack of specific

evidence as to who actually did the tapping. Two codefendants,

on Holcomb's acquittal, changed their pleas from guilty to not

•guilty and had the charges dismissed. In 1956 he offered his.

services to the police department, sheriff's office and private

detectives in Houston,

Texas.

is an auxiliary police officer

at Oakland Park, Florida, and has used his equipment to assist

local police departments

and sheriffs' offices in that area.

Any dealing with Holcomb or any individual or company

selling Solar products should be most circumspect.

In no event

should it be indicated that the Bureau is interested in Solar

products except for the purpose of keeping abreast of new

developments in the law enforcement field.

Any use of the Bureau's.

name to promote Solar sales should be promptly reported.

(C) AUTOMOBILES - TWO-WAY EM MOBILE RADIOS -- SAC Letter 57-40,

dated July 9, 1957, pointed out the possibilities of explosion

and fire in

the trunk of an automobile due to the ignition of

accumulated gasoline fumes by a spark from a two-way radio

«transmitter.

This SAC Letter instructed that adequate steps be

taken to insure that! gasoline tanks on two-way radio cars were

free from leaks which would permit fumes to enter the trunk

compartment.

55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 1104

---

## Page 1105

It has been noted during recent radio equipment

maintenance inspections in several field offices that some

two-way radio automobile installations have the two-way unit

Installed in the main part of the trunk directly above the

gasoline tank. This is considered a very undesirable practice

since there is very little space between the floor of the

car trunk and the gasoline tank and 1t is quite easy to puncture

the gasoline tank during the course of the radio installation.

No instances of gasoline fumes in the trunks of cärs were

noted during the maintenance inspections.

However, the in-

herent danger is such that you are instructed that all future

two-way radio installations in cars must have the radio unit

mounted in such location and in such manner that there is no

chance of any mounting screws penetrating the gasoline tank.

Also, all field Electronic Maintenance Technicians should be

instructed to carefully inspect all present two-way radio :

installations to assure that there is not now any gasoline

fume leakage into automobile trunks and that the installations

are completely safe in all other respects.

...

The primary purpose of the Fugitive Felon Act is to

permit the FBI to locate and apprehend fugitives who flee across

state lines to avoid state

justice.

We do not have the responsi-

bility of solving or investigating the state crime; however, we

must be ever alert to detect any possibility that state officials

have requested location of a person other than the one responsible

for the state offense.

In many instances, we will be interviewing

•ersons who are also witnesses in the state case for the purpose

if developing fugitive leads, background information and contacts

of the subject.

In connection with such interviews, we must be

alert to any information which would suggest an erroneous identi-

fication may have been made by local authorities. Should such

occur,

the facts should be immediately brought to the attention

of local authorities and the U.S. Attorney, and immediate steps

taken to correct the situation, promptly furnishing full facts to

the Bureau.

In an important area of our assistance to local

authorities under the expanded Fugitive Felon Act, namely confine-

ment cases, which include state parole violator fugitives, there

is already

a positive identification with a known fingerprint

record. This identifying information should be obtained at the .

outset of the investigation.

An aggressive discharge of our responsibilities under

the act requires the establishment of effective liaison with

state parole and penal authorities.

-

As. pointed out in the Manual of Instructions, Section 49,

the Department has advised the Fugitive Felon Act is broad enough

to include state parole and probation violators who flee interstate

to avoid confinement after their probation or parole has been

• state offense within the provisions of Title 18,

Section 1073. Application of the act in such cases is not

directed at the state parole or probation offense itself, which

In some instances may not be a felony, but is directed toward

the state offense for which the

subject was originally convicted.

Accordingly, in any case where the prior conviction was for a

felony, the act might be

applied.

The Department has given considerable latitude and

discretion to U.S. Attorneys in the enforcement of the act and

has not limited its application to a particular list of state

crimes. The Department rather has advised U. S. Attorneys that

the act may be applied except where the purpose of the local

statute is the enforcement of a civil obligation, or where the

local law or application thereof is discriminatory.

(G) SECURITY INFOFMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENT OF' INCOME TAXES --

As a result of contemplated prosecutions under the Internal

Security Act of 1950, Departmental attorneys are interviewing

many Informants and former informants as prospective witnesses

In a number of our offices.

This is to again remind you that

Section 107, N, 6; Manual of Instructions, requires that informants

who receive compensation for their services to the Bureau should

be advised that such compensation must be reported as income when

filing income tax returns.

When an informant or former informant is initially con-

sidered as a potential witness in a Bureau case, it is desirable

when advising him of the approaching interview by Departmental

attorneys to ascertain prior to such interview all necessary in-

formation concerning his tax status. If he has not paid his taxes,

obtain all pertinent details and promptly submit your recommendations

for handling

this situation.

(H): SECURITY INFORMANTS - CHANNELIZING INFORMANT STATEMENTS --

The

following method for preparing informant statements, which are

orally received and where multiple channelization is involved, is

being brought to your attention for use if suited to the needs of

your office.

Where the number of copies to be channelized requires

the use of Multilith equipment; it is suggested that when typing

up the original of the statement for authentication by the informant,

the plain paper, devoid of Bureau markings or identification,

should be inserted in the typewriter backed by Multilith Reproducing

Carbon Paper, No. 200-837-100A, and a Multilith master in that order.

In this manner as the original is typed, the same impression is

recorded on the Multilith master. Then, after authentication of

the original by the informant, the master is available to run off

the requisite channelizing copies.

The cost to the Government of the aforementioned brand of

carbon paper is about $2.67 per 100 sheets which are 10 inches by

132 Inches in size.

Experimentation with this paper, which is

• designed for one-time use, has disclosed that, by cutting it in

half and using each half

twice by reversing it top to bottom after

each use, each full sheet may be used four times.

The Bureau does

not stock this paper; therefore, each office desiring to make use

of this system is authorized to

purchase it locally.

(I) CIRCUIT RID RS, INC. -- It has recently come to the Bureau's

attention that circult Riders, Incorporated, has published a book

entitled "A Compilation of Public Records of 658 Clergymen and

Laymen Connected With the National Council of Churches."

A copy

of this book was mailed directly to the Special Agent lin Charge

at one of our offices, and it is possible that other offices may

receive copies of this book.

For your information, the Circuit

R'ders is an organization made up primarily of laymen in the

-I.thodist. Church whose cojective.is to_combatcommunism in the

'ethodist Church; however, the organization has no official con-

section with that Church.

Myers G. Lowman is the Executive

Secretary of the organization, and

in recent years he has leveled

numerous charges against clergymen: indicating they are sympathetic

toward communism.

Lowman has been

critical in the past of speeches

on communism by a Bureau official and while we accept information

from Lowman, contacts are most circumspect with him.

Lowman, through his organization, has disseminated

several other books of a similar type as the current one, which is

a compilation of affillations of the officers and clergymen of the

National Council of Churches in pacifist organizations, one-world

groups, socialist organizations, popular-front-type of

action

groups and communist front organizations, publications, petitions,

et cetera. The reliability of the material in Lowman's book has

not been established, and you should, therefore, appropriately

mark this book, it you should receive a copy, to the effect that

there

has been no corroboration of the material it contains and --

the FBI should in no instance utilize it as a source by itself.

In all cases, the original source, if there is one, should be

utilized rather than the book.

(E) USE OF FORM FD-217 TO OBTAIN BUREAU FILE NUMBER -- Manual

of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 4, Page 3, Paragraph 14,

requires that form FD-217 be used

by the field to obtain the

Bureau file number when additional correspondence with the Bureau

can be foreseen.

Use of the Bureau file number on

correspondence

from the field reduces processing time and costs at the Seat of

Government and is an aid to identification of the case both in

the fiëld and at the Seat of Government.

A number of Instances have been noted at the Bureau where

Form FD-217 is not attached to correspondence being submitted, the

Bureau file number is not quoted, and it is apparent that additional

correspondence will be had with the Bureau.

You should insure that

personnel in your office are properly utilizing Form FD-217 and that

they are quoting the Bureau file number on correspondence when it is

available. For your information, it is not necessary to quote the

Bureau file number on applicant-type correspondence.

(F) TRAINING - POLICE - STATE ACCREDITATION -- Many instances

have come to the Bureau's attention where funds have been made

available for police training by state boards of education if

certain requirements have been met. One requirement often is

that all instructors participating in these schools be accredited

to teach by the state board of education. Some offices have felt

that FBI instructors should be given this accreditation and

overtures of blanket accreditation for all FBI instructors have

been made In at least one instance.

such accreditation is usually

in the form of a vocational teaching certificate.

(G) CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION - Reference

1s made to SAC Letter 62-19 (J) dated March 27, 1962, emphasizing

the constant critical need for top quality informants. Many

Informants throughout the field supply a vast amount of information

consistently which enables the Bureau to successfully conclude

highly important matters. Many of these informants because of

their intimate knowleage of criminals and criminal activities

beyond their immediate communities have been successfully used

In penetrating illegal operations in distant areas.

A survey of offices operating the most productive

Informants revealed these informants were developed as a

result of initially carefully selecting individuals close

to criminal operations and thereafter expending sufficient

time and effort to further their development.

approach was for the ostensible purpose of interviewing the

prospective informant as a suspect in a pending matter.

The

elimination of the potential informant as a

suspect

fostered

a climate conducive to his further development since many

criminals are apprehensive of being "set up" because of their

past records:

It was found. that an extensive period of careful

handling was vital to the exploitation of full potential of

the

Informant. During this period, background concerning the

Individual under development was obtained to the extent that

the prospective informant was convinced that the FBI was aware

of the most minute details of his

activities.

In most instances at the outset financial reward

was not an important factor in the development of top flight

Informants. However, after the individual committed himself

to cooperate, money became

"all important" in maintaining his

continued interest and productivity.

Obtaining signed receipts

presented no problem and was felt to be beneficial in most

instances.

Once payments were started to the informant.

promptness in paying for information appeared to be more

Important to the informant than the actual amount paid.

Without exception respect for the FBI was the high

motivating factor in his assumption of the informant role.

In some cases distrust of police officers in the early stages

•of development included FBI Agents:

This had to be overcome

by a confident mature approach of the Special Agent in

portraying the Bureau's high standard of operation and role

of the confidential informant in bringing about the Bureau's

successful accomplishments. Discussion with the informant as

to the safeguards utilized by the Bureau to protect informants

and how arrests and recoveries could be effected without

disclosing an informant's identity were essential points in

stablishing the necessary confidence to induce the prospective

nformant to actively produce information -for the Bureau...

In connection with the development and the subsequent

handling of the informant it was frequently necessary to insure

no action was taken by him which would arouse the suspicion of

his criminal associates.

Of necessity the Special Agent must

exercise a high degree of ingenuity and maturity in guiding

the informant.

An interesting facet of the criminal mind on which

Special Agents have been able to capitalize is the intense.

dislike harbored by criminals for certain types of other

criminals. Frequently the thief has contempt for the narcotics

vendor; the armed robber intense dislike for the confidence

man, and so on.

Giving the informant a sense of importance, showing

respect for his judgment, accepting his past, and instilling

a sense of accomplishment serve to promote the spirit of

i cooperation which results in increased productivity. Although

some information may be trivial, it was important to take

copious notes even on the most minute piece of information

to impress the informant and to later evaluate his reliability.

The above is to assist you in this important phase

of our operations which has such a direct bearing on our over-

all accomplishments.

ESPIONAGE AND FOREIGN INELZICENCE INVESTIIONS SUPVEIZANCES

OF SOVIET-BLOC PERSONNEL --

For years Soviet officials in the United

States have made numerous and repeated trips throughout this country

aimed at obtaining valuable data regarding our air bases, missile

sites and other inportant defense installations.

In recent years

they have coordinated their activities in this regard with the

satellite countries and in this way are getting coverage of areas

In the United States closed to Soviet travel.

In connection with our responsibility in regard to coverage

of soviet-bloc activities, these Soviet-bloc officials have been

placed under surveillance. Many offices have participated in these

surveillances, and It appears that this activity on the part of the

Soviet bloc will continue.

On May 16, 1952, a number of newspapers in the United

States carried an Associated Press article, date line Moscow, May 15,

1962, reporting that a correspondent for

"Izvestia,

" the official

Soviet Government newspaper, alleged that during a

the United States he was constantly shadowed by the

"American secret

service."

He also alleged newspaper reporters and television men

had "close business connections with the FBI" because reporters met

him at the railroad station in Portland, Oregon, when he arrived

there. He alleged he was under heavy surveillance in Seattle,

Washington, and furnished license numbers of two automobiles he

alleged were conducting surveillance of him in Los Angeles,

California.

The Bureau determined that the allegations of the Soviet

correspondent, were completely false and undoubtedly were an attemot

by the soviets to embarrass this Bureau and to curtail our counter-

Intelligence operations. There is a definite possibility other

Soviet-bloc personnel may make similar charges in the future and

• In this connection may attempt to obtain proof of their allegations,

such as obtaining photographs of Bureau cars or surveillance agents.

It is known that bloc personnel have made numerous attempts to do

this in the past.

We do not intend to allow a false allegation by the

Soviet bloc to alter coverage of their activities.

Our surveil-

lances undoubtedly have hampered the Soviets in collection of

Intelligence data in the United States, and we can expect them

to create or utilize any incident they

can as a basis for protest

against our coverage.

It is desired, therefore, that the above facts be

called to the attention of all agents.

It should be pointed

out that while the Bureau desires our coverage of Soviet-bloc

officials to be as complete as possible, the surveillance

must be discreet and every precaution must be taken to avoid

giving the soviets a basis for protest.

You should impress upon agents handling surveillances

of Soviet-bloc personnel in the United States that they must

constantly exercise keen alertness, careful planning and good

judgment in handling all facets of our surveillance operations.

(F) SECURITY INFORMANTS' - CONTROL - Department representatives

have been interviewing security informants as possible witnesses in

prosecutions under the Internal Security Act of 1950. In many cases,

security informants have shown considerable reluctance to testify

except in the event of a national

emergency for lear or physical

harm, social and business reprisals and other personal'

reasons.

Ir structions are now outstanding for informants to submit their

- 1 formation in such form-that if they are called upon to testify

• seir written statements will be available for introduction in court

o back up their testimony.

Despite the fact that they realize they may be needed as

iitnesses in the future, some informants are reluctant to testify

I'or the reasons noted above.

It is the responsibility of the Special Agents handling

security informants to condition them to the fact that someday the

knowledge they possess may be needed as evidence in court to assist

our Government in combatting the evil of communism. All Special.

Agents handling security informants must, as a part of our over-all

Informant program, psychologically prepare the informants for the

lact they mays: at

some future date, be called upon to render a still

further contribution to their Government by testifying to the infor-

mation they

have furnished concerning security matters.

The proper indoctrination of Informants in this regard

is absolutely essential since it is incumbent upon the Bureau to

provide witnesses whenever the Department initiates prosecution in

security cases.

(G) • SECURITY INFORMANTS - PAYMENTS FOR EXPENSES - The exorbitant

financial demands by the Nation of Islam (NOI) on its members was

subject of discussion at the Internal Security-Espionage

Conference held at the Seat of Government on May 28-29, 1962. It

was noted that each temple of the NOI sets the amount of dues which

members must pay and also requires numerous other collections.

Nembers are threatened with expulsion if they do not meet these

demands.

Informants in some cases, however, have been able to

remain in the organization without.making all these payments. All

offices should carefully analyze the necessity for informants in

any temple to pay the maximum required contributions of the NoI.

Instruct informants to curtail their expenses and whenever possible

have informants create the impression among the temple officials

that they are having financial problems. Work closely with the

Informants in this regard and caution them that the Bureau will not

automatically approve their expenses.

(F) SEARCHES AND SEIZURES -- Federal courts have recently ruled

adversely to the government in two Bureau cases involving questions

of search and seizure. These decisions illustrate again the need

for all investigative personnel to know and closely follow the

rules pertaining to the crucial search function in criminal cases.

In U.S. v. Rutheiser, 203 F. Supp. 891 (1962), Agents

went to the defendant's home at 8:30 p.m. and obtained what they

considered to be a valid consent to search the home. The search

disclosed stolen goods and the carton in which the goods had

arrived, both of which were specifically pointed out to the Agents

by the defendant during the search. The court ruled, however,

that although the "

by

the agents,"

defendant did acquiesce to the search

such acquiesence was

... not that consent

which constitutes an unequivocal; Iree and intelligent waiver

of a fundamental right."

In reaching this conclusion,

the

court agreed with the defendant's argument that

... the

resence of the agents in his home at night created an

tmosphere of coercion and duress.

Cases such as this one admittedly pose a difficult

problem.

The truck driver from whom the defendant allegedly

received the stolen goods was in the Bureau office at the

moment, and an immediate search of the defendant's premises

seemed

both logical and necessary. Delay of the search until

daytime might have resulted in the defendant becoming apprised

of the investigation and disposing of the contraband.

Although the Federal courts vary considerably in their

receptivity to consent searches, and a different court might

well have upheld the search here, consent searches should

always be viewed as difficult to

sustain. Duress is often

implied from such circumstancés as an abnormal hour of search,

words of demand rather than request to search, or any show of

force such as a large number of officers on the premises.

Before attempting a search by consent, consideration

should be given always to the possibility of obtaining a-search

warrant. Searches by warrant are preferable to searches by

consent, and particularly so when premises are involved.

In Mosco v. U. S., 301 F2d 180 (1962), four separate

searches were made but the results of only two were allowed

These two were a consent search of a vehicle

and a consent search of the person, both made by Bureau Agents.

To the contrary, the results of a search of premises. by an

Agent and a local officer, and a vehicle search by a local

officer alone, were not allowed into evidence.

As to the search of premises, the court found that an

Agent and a local officer properly went into the apartment of

one of the two defendants to arrest him on a bank robbery

charge but, on finding the defendant not there, improperly

searched the apartment for evidence some thirty

minutes in

advance of the defendant's arrest when he returned to the

apartment. There being no search warrant and no consent,

MẠT:

the search could be sustained only if made incidental to the

arrest, and It did not meet the requirements for this type of

search

because it was made before the arrest rather than

Immediately subsequent thereto as required by the law.

The search of the same defendant's vehicle by a local

officer was ruled out because It was made on no-legal-basis

whatsoever.

Moreover, defendant's later consent to search his

vehicle, obtained after his arrest, did not cure the illegality

of the search made previously.

The court said, "All searches, such as they were, were

reasonable. They were not such as would

shock the conscience

of justice, nor were they contrary to one's sense of fair play."

Nevertheless, two of the searches were held insufficient to

meet Federal constitutional standards.

(G)' REPORT WRITING - SECURITY - THOROUGHNESS -- The Bureau has

recently noted a number of instances in security matter reports

wherein some anticipated or planned activity is reported but

there is no follow-up statement in the report that the activity

did, in fact, take place. This has occurred even thougn the

period of the report has encompassed the date of the alleged

activity. This is obviously an undesirable practice as it

Teaves the reader "up in the air" as-to whether the activity -

did or did not take place.

Also, such a situation could imply

Inadequate investigation and thus prove embarrassing because

of the responsibility the Bureau has for dissemination to other

agencies which rely on the Bureau for the full facts in given

situations.

This matter should be brought to the attention of all

Special Agents engaged in security work who should be reminded

of the necessity for thoroughness in the preparation of reports

so as to eliminate the undesirable tendency noted above.

(H). / CHINESE. REFUGEE SITUATION -- In accordance with the

President's request, the Attorney General and, under his

direction, the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization

Service (INS) are formulating a program to bring to the United

States 3,209. Chinese refugees in Hong Kong. It is anticipated

that these refugees will be arriving in the near future at the

rate of 25-50 per day. The Bureau does not intend to investigate

all of these refugees who, incidentally, reportedly have resided

In Hong Kong from 8-10 years.

The field should promptly alert

all logical informants, potential security informants,

confidential

• sources and sources of information for indications that any of

these refugees is engaged in activities inimical to interests

of the United States.

Inasmuch as these Chinese refugees are entering the

United States as immigrants, field offices would normally be

alerted to their presence under the current program of "Chinese

Allens Entering the United States for Permanent Residence."

However, before investigation is considered, the following

minimum criteria should be applied:

RE: "SECURITY INDEX - CUBA

SAC letter Number 60-54 established criteria for inclusion

of individuals on the Security Index based on their pro-Castro

sympathies and for the tabbing as "pro-Cuban" of other individuals

already on the Security Index.

in recognition of the mounting

tension between Cuba and the United States, additional standards

for placing individuals on the

security Index based solely or

their pro-Castro activities and symathies have been established

to complement the

standards outlined in SAC letter 60-54.

Aliens of Cuban nationality and aliens holding Cuban

citizenship should be considered for the Security Index when it

is determined that one of these (i) is likely to foster,

encourage, or promote the policies, prugrams, or objectives of

the Cuban Government, or collacorate wich the Cuban Government

(2) is likely to

engage in of attempt to engage in acts oi

-

espionage, sabotage or other activitles inimical or detrimental

to the defense or public safety of the United States as shorn by

overt acts or statements established through reliable sources,

informants, or individuals.

Activities on a subject's part which should be considered

in determining whether his name should be added to the Security

Index under the above would include but should not be limited to

(1) participation in organizations suporting the Castro regime,

(2) participation in picket lines formed in support of the

Cuban Governuent:

(3) contacts with Cuban agents operating in

this country on benalt of the Cuban Government or,

(4) Statements

or activities on a subject's part establishing reasonable grounds

to believe that his loyalty would lie with the Cuban Government

There must be a showing of activities of the type

described above subsequent to October 1, 1950, and this must

be verified by investigation. In essence, these standards

have been established to cover Cuban nationals who have definitely

evidenced

support of Castro or a connunist regime in Cuba since

October 1, 1960.

This move is being made to insure special consideration

is given those

potentially dangerous individuals who retain

basic loyalties to the procommunist, pro-Soviet Bloc and anti-U. S.

regime in Cuba but who have found it expedient not to engage

in activities to an extent which would bring them within the

previously proscribed standards.

Effective immediately no cases-involving pro-Castro

allegations against aliens of

Cuban nationality and aliens holding

Cuban citizenship are to

be closed without consideration being

given to whether the subjects thereor should be piaced on the

Security Index in keeping with this sac letter.

A statement

showing why they do not qualify should be included on

the appropriate FD-122 reconmending inclusion of the individual

on the Security Index is not

Your 105-0 files and any other appropriate control files (suchas

those containing INS name check forms G-135a showing pro-Castro

allegations have been made against Cuban aliens arriving in the

U. S.) should also be reviewed.

Special consideration is to be given those individuals

previously reconmended for the Security Index but whose participation

in organizational activities on behalf of Castro was not sufficient

to come within the previously established criteria.

Concerning

those individuals whose investigative files show they clearly tail

In o1 ler that special handling may be afforded "pro-

each office should at this time set up a new category of the

Special Section of the Security Index designated "Cuban."

Existing instructions applying to the handiing of Spécial Section

Manual of Instructions, should be adhered to.

In the innediate Iuture Bureau wili torward to each

interested ortice amended Security Index cards designated in the

upper right-hand corner "CUB" for this Special Section.

SAC letter 60-54 (F) provided for "pro-Cuban" tabbing

of individuals carried on the Security Index for reasons other

than their Cuban organization affiliations or nationalistic

tendencies.

The security index cards on such subjects are not

to be placed in the new "Cuban" Special Section..

In order that

they may be readily identified, however

these cards in the

Alphabetical Section of the Security Index should be tabbed

with a metal

taù of a color different fron that used to tab

"DETCO"" subjects.

In the immediate future Bureau will forard

to each interested office a list of those subjects whose names

should be so tabbed.

For your information, cards on such subjects

contain the capital letter

• "C" on the left

side of the card at

the beginning of the second line.

Upon receipt of the foregoing amended cards and lists,

all offices are to immediately verify the residences and emloy-

ments of those Security Index subjects placed thereon on the basis

of their pro-Castro activities as well as those other Security

Index subjects tabbed "pro-Cuban.

FD-122 showing changes should

be expedited.

Be certain arrangements are made to assure you

are advised of any subsequent changes in their residences

and

employments.

this review and advise the Bureau by october 31, 1962. as follows.

(1) Number of individuals being recommended for

based on field office's evaluation that they positively fall

within the newly established criteria; (2) Number of cases being

opened or reopened to establish whether the individuals fit the

pro-Castro activities and all security Index subjects tabbed

"pro-Cuban" have been verified or a statement as to the number

of such individuals whose residences and employments

have not

been verified and when this will be accomplished.

Miami and

New York should advise the Bureau by November 15, 1962.

With regard to the "pro-Cuban" tabbing of current

Security Index subjects, the following procedure is to be effected

immediately. During the annual review of all Security Index cases

special attention must be given to each case and a determination

made as to whether those who have in any manner demonstrated

strong sympathies for the present Cuban regime have backgrounds,

employments or special aptitudes which would make them potential

threats to engage in sabotage or other disruptive activitles

should there be hostilities with Cuba. For example,

those with

certain specialized military training,

those employed at key

facilities, and those who have received training in police work

or the use of explosives would warrant special consideration.

FD-122 with succinct summary should accompany

the annual report

in each case where "pro-Cuban", tabbing is believed warranted.

RE: BUREAU CODES

A number of field offices have sent to the Bureau

recently enciphered messages which could not be deciphered.

This causes delay and unnecessary expenditure of employee time

in attempting to decode such garbled messages.

The AFSAM-7 Manual of Operation and Routine Maintenance,

Section II B., subsection 2.g., page 12, instructs that an

enciphered message is to be completely check-deciphered prior

to transmission, preferably by another operator and, if avail-

able, on a second machine using a different set oi

rotors.

This

check-decipherment is mandatory.

If this check-decipherment procedure were followed

meticulously on all messages by each office, failures to encode

properly would be detected prior to transmission, and the

majority of garbles in

messages would be eliminated.

Explanations will be requested by the Bureau for

messages received which are undecipherable, and if this is due

to failure to check-decipher, appropriate administrative action

will

be taken.

SAC LETTER NO. 62-66 .

(D)! CIVIL SERVICE. RETIREMENT BENEFITS -- Public Law 87-793 approved

October 11, 1962, liberalized in several respects the retirement

benefits granted by the Civil Service Retirement Act.

The new

... benefits await implementation by Congressional appropriation of the

necessary funds.

This cannot occur until the 88th Congress convenes

In January, 1963. Legislation will then be introduced looking

toward appropriation of such funds.

The new benefits relate mainly to upward adjustment in

amount of annuity and to increased survivor protection.

Provisions which would affect the amount of annuity

include:

(2).

The annuity of each retired employee and survivor annuitant

receiving or eligible to receive an annuity on January 1, 1963, would

be increased 5 per cent. Annuities commencing between January 2,

and December 31, 1963,

would be increased 4 per sent; those com-

mencing during 1964,

3 per cent; those commencing during 1965, 2

per cent; and those

commencing during 1966, 1 per cent.

(2) Beginning in January, 1964, yearly changes in the nation-

wide cost of

living will be reviewed by the Civil Service Commission

and whenever the cost of living rises at least 3 per cent, annuities

will be further increased by a percentage matching the rise in the

cost of living.

(3)

The :reduction in an employee's annuity to provide for a survivor

annuity will be changed from 22

per cent of the first $2400, plus

10 per cent of the balance to 21 per cent of the first: $3000, plus

10 per cent of the balance.

funds, to all retiring.

This will apply, once Congress appropriates

employees separated on or after October 11,

1962, with an annuity commencing after that time.

• .

Provisions which increase survivor protection include:

(1) The survivor has been eligible for 50 per cent of the annuity

of the employee but the new law changes this to 55 per cent.

This

applies to annuities based on separations occurring on or after

October 11, 1962, but again must await appropriation of the necessary

funds. Furthermore, instead of requiring that a retiring married

employee must specifically designate his spouse to receive a

survivor annuity, such annuity will be payable automatically unless

employee at the time he retires specifies otherwise in writing.

This particular change is now in effect and requires no appropriation

by Congress.

(2) Survivor annuity payments to a child otherwise eligible for

annuity can continue beyond the former limit of age 18 and up to

age 21 if he is a student regularly pursuing full-time residence

study in a high school, trade school, technical or vocational

institute, junior college, college, university or comparable

recognized

institution.

This

Will

apply where the parent employee

or annuitant dies on or after October 11, 1962, or where the death

occurred before that date but

; the surviving student-child is not 18

until on or after that date.

The annuity of a student-child

ends

when he

marries, dies, ceases to be a student or becomes 21,

whichever occurs first. This benefit likewise must await appropriation

of the necessary funds by Congress.

(F) ' ECONOMY - FISCAL YEAR 1963 - An analysis at this time of the

Bureau's financial condition projected through the end of the current

fiscal year (1963) indicates many items of expense are being incurred

at a rate that if continued would substantially exceed available

•funds. For example, (1) the Bureau is being required by the Bureau

of the Budget to absorb an additional cost of about $133,000 for

postage rate increases to go into effect January 1, 1963, for which

no additional funds will be made available; (2) higher costs of

long distance,

and teletype services; (3) higher travel costs;

and (4) repairs/ and

alterations to space.

Your attention was called

to the higher communications costs

in item A of SAC Letter No. 62-45

dated August 28, 1962.

Because oi these higher costs, and

in order

to make sure no deficit will be incurred, the Burcau is making a

corresponding reduction in the funds available for the purchase of

equipment.

This action means that only requests for absolutely

essential supplies and equipment will be approvca by the Bureau.

You have previously been advised of the need for the reduction

of travel expenses. The Bureau of the Budget has now advised

that the percentage of first-class air flights by employees of

the Bureau traveling first-class by air must have prior approval

from the Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Director unless

no other air accommodations are available and there is not

•sufficient time to obtain the authority of the Special Agent in

Charge or Assistant Director.

In any instance where first-class

air travel is used, a statement must accompany the voucher

claiming reimbursement justifying the use of the first-class

accommodations.

of the NOI should contain a current approved thumbnail sketch

pertaining to the national organization of the NOI and/or Fruit

I am pleased to note the decrease in the over-all number of accidents

during fiscal year 1962. The number of accidents was reduced from 309 in fiscal

year 1961 to 286 for fiscal year 1962. A close analysis of this report reflects a

favorable trend in several areas and I certainly hope this trend continues.

It should be noted that the principal cause of accidents was rear-end

collisions which accounted for 65.9 per cent of all accidents in which Bureau

employees were held responsible. Intersection collisions ranked second accounting

for 22.7 per cent of those accidents in which Bureau employees were beld responsible.

A number of accidents which-occurred in 1962-were the result of cars' striking-parked

vehicles, cars being sideswiped and drivers' pulling out from parked positions at

the curb into moving traitic.

Last year instructions were issued that each employee must develop

good defensive driving babits in order to keep the number of accidents at a minimum.

These instructions should be reiterated at this time to endeavor to effect an even

further reduction in accidents.

- (3) INVESTIGATIVE MATTERS RECEIVED -- An examination of the Monthly

- Administrative Reports reflects there is a substantial decrease in the number

of investigative matters being received, the cause of which must be immedi-

_ately determined and necessary remedial action taken.

All offices showing a decrease in investigative matters received are

requested to thoroughly review the situation so that the factors contributing

to this decrease may be determined and steps taken to correct this undesirable

trend which has occurred.

An examination of all sources from which cases are received should

disclose any weaknesses in existence. It is desired that this study be completed

within ten days of the receipt of this letter and that your findings, together with

specific recommendations for corrective action taken by you, be submitted to

the Bureau.

SEIZURE OF MATERIAL UNDER INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF OBSCENE

MATTER STATUTE -- The decision on November 5, 1962, by the Circuit

court of Appeals, fourth circuit, reversing the convictions of

Arthur Abraham Peisner and Harry

Morris Disman for violation of the

Interstate Transportation of Obscene Matter Statute expresses views

on probable cause which should be kept in mind during future

Investigations of this type.

In October, 1958, a reliable informant advised that

Peisner would transport obscene material from Maryland to New York,

probably over-the week end of October 31, 1958. He had previously

been linked with the manufacture and sale of obscene material.

Bureau Agents on November 1, 1958, observed Peisner and Disman

loading packages into a car at Peisner's Maryland residence.

were observed driving through Delaware and into New Jersey where

they entered the New Jersey Turnpike.

Bureau Agents alerted the

New Jersey State Police to the possibility that Peisner and Disman

were transporting obscene material, and the subjects were arrested

by the State Police while on the turnpike. More than 1,500 obscene

books were taken from the car.

A Federal complaint was filed, and

both subjects were convicted

for violation of the Interstate Trans-

portation of Obscene Matter Statute.

On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the

convictions of both

subjects.

The search of the automobile without

a warrant was not based on sufficient probable cause to believe that

the books being transported were obscene.

Once examined, the

obscenity of the books was admitted, but the information

in possession

of the officers at the time the search of the automobile was initiated

was insufficient to meet a strict standara of probable cause for

vehicle search in ooscene literature,cases. The court concluded

that as

a minimal requirement for a search for and seizure of

publications thought to be obscene it is essential that some qualified

Individual, aware of the proper test of obscenity as announced in

the case of Roth v. United States, 354 US 476 (1957), should have

made a determination prior to search and seizure that a publication

meets that test.

The proper test of obscenity as announced in the

Roth case is "whether to the average person, applying contemporary

community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a

whole appeals

to prurient interest."

The court held that the test

1s the effect "not upon any particular class, but upon all those

vihom 1t is likely to reach.").

A different conclusion was reached in the case of Weise v

United States, 251 F 2d 867 (1958), in which the facts were strik-

Ingly similar and the "minimal requirement" demanded by the court

In the Peisner decision was not present. The Circuit Court of

Appeals, Ninth Circuit, upheld the conviction in the

Weise case,

and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, thus leaving

the conviction standing.

The conflict in the decision in the Peisner case and

that in the weise case leaves in doubt the standard of probable

cause which will be followed by the next court hearing a case of a

similar nature.

The decisions in the two cases have been set forth

for the information and guidance of Agent personnel handling Inter-

state Transportation of Obscene Matter Investigations. It is to

be noted that a. warrant of arrest had been obtained in the Weise

case but not in the Peisner case.

You are again reminded of the

колос

existing Bureau rule that, wherever possible, a warrant offarrest

should be obtained.

Six persons were present and they, according to the

source, comprised the beginning of an officer corps of

a copy of

the program of the wUFINS, stating that he expects to

arrest and sentencing of a bank robber are not as interesting or

newsworthy as the account of the crime itself. However, the

prominent display of bank robbery stories without similar display of

the accounts of arrest and sentencing of a robber might weed leac

others to attempt the crime with the mistaken feeling that it is

a good way to get rich quickly. The recent general increase in

crimes of this nature certainly demands the best efforts of all

interested cluizens to reduce these serious orienses.

Within a week after your last conference, advise Bureau of

results of your conferences, giving the number of people in attendance,

the number of different agencies represented (broken down according

to law enforcement, banks, banking associations, Federal credit unions,

insurance companies, surety companies, etc.), as well as dates and

number of conferences completed. Provide specific statements of

interest made

by those in attendance, sampling of newspaper publicity

received, and any suggestions heard for improvement of law enforcement

RE: TELEPHONES -

"SECURITY OF BUREAU TELEPHONE SERVICE

Telephone companies are rapidly extending the automation of telephone

services.-With this-automation program_theyareincreasing the number of

unattended telephone exchanges. Some operating companies have found it

economically necessary to incorporate facilities to permit operators to use

a device, known as a "no test number" or a "busy verification test," to dial

in and listen to the conversation on a busy telephone line. The number the

operator must dial to override the busy signal is classified "SECRET"' by the

companies and is disseminated only on a "need-to-know" basis. This number,

while classified "SECRET," may be inadvertently disclosed to an unauthorized

person who may use it to monitor telephone conversations.

This "busy verification test" number, while limited to a relatively:

few isolated areas, is not restricted to local calls but can be extended to

-dialed long- distance calls.

It is nossible for a person, knowledgeable of the

• busy verification code number, to dial in on a busy telephone line in these

isolated areas from any part of the United States and Canada, where direct.

distance dialing facilities are present, and to listen to the conversation on

the busy line. The automatic accounting machines in the exchange will

identify the telephone subscriber using the "secret number" in making the

call as well as the number dialed but will report the call as being "non-.

billable."

The Bureau recognizes that the busy override feature is available in

only a limited number of isolated areas; however, it is felt that, because of

the potential security problem involved in any dial system, you should conduct

a-survey and advise Bureau of the number of exchanges which have the busy

override feature. Your survey should be restricted to lines serving your

office, resident agencies, any other official telephone lines and the home

telephones of your supervisory and resident agent personnel who may handle

official calls at their residences. In addition, you should indicate what

Steps you are taking to have those lines, which your survey indicates are

avallable to the override feature, isolated from the override equipment.

further, you should outline what preventive measures you have effected to

insure against the Bureau lines being subjected to this undesirable condition

in the future.

All security checks of official lines shall, in the future, include inquiry.

concerning the busy override feature and, when applicable, verification that

There is attached, for the assistance of the Sound-trained personnel

of your office, a technical discussion of the above-mentioned override device.

SECURITY OF TELEPHONE SYSTEMS-

BUSY LINE VERIFICATION

Concurrent with the inauguration of dial

telephone

systems the telephone operating companies provided a means for

an_operator and/or test deskman to verify

a busy line condition.

Most of the operating companies follow the

practice of having only

one special trunk line per 10,000 subscribers for use in making

busy line verification tests and they restrict the use of this line

to supervisory personnel. It is not possible, with this special

trunk feature, for unauthorized individuals to seize or override

a busy telephone line as the special trunk line is restricted to

the perimeter of a single central office or exchange building where

it is accessible to only a limited number of employees. It is not,

therefore, available to persons dialing from subscriber and/or

unauthorized

stations.

The rapid extension of automated telephone services and

the increased reliability of dial switching equipment have encouraged

-the operating telephone companies to increase the number of un-

attended dial exchanges. These unattended exchanges seldom require

attention and therefore are, for the most

part; visited by authorized

personnel only when there is a need to repair a reported trouble.

Testing of switching equipment and verification of busy line

conditions are performed from a centrally located test center and/or

operator-attended exchange building. All equipment testing between

the test center and the unattended exchange and the busy line

verification at the unattended exchange is done over high-quality,

revenue-producing trunk circuits that must be taken out of service

for these purposes.

In order to produce maximum revenue with existing

facilities some operating companies have devised a secret number

system whereby operators and/or test deskmen may call an unattended

exchange over regular subscriber trunking paths to make busy line

verification tests.

This procedure releases revenue-producing

telephone lines that would otherwise be tied up for test purposes.

The number used for this busy line verification is classified

"SECRET" by the operating companies and is disseminated to employees

only on a "need-to-know" basis.

-.

An operator or test deskman making a busy verification

test will first dial the exchange, then the secret number or numbers,

followed by the station code (last four digits). If the line is

busy the employee making the call will first get a busy signal then

WW 55044 DocId:32909526 Page 1215

---

## Page 1216

the connector will "override the busy line" and connect the caller

to the conversation in progress. The connection will be made to

the called subscriber's line without alerting the subscriber.

If

there is a conversation in progress the operator can report a "busy

line" condition; however, if there is no conversation on the line

the operator will usually report that the "line is out of order"

and so advise the trouble desk.

The attendant at the trouble desk

will then dispatch craftsmen to repair the trouble.

The busy verification number, while classified "SECRET,"

may inadvertently be disclosed to an unauthorized person who may

use it to monitor telephone conversations.

The use of the busy

verification,

although limited to a relatively few isolated areas,

is not restricted to local calls. It is possible for a person,

knowledgeable of the busy verification code number, to dial in on

a busy telephone line from any part of the United States and Canada.

where direct distance dialing facilities are available without being

charged for the call. The automatic accounting equipment assigned

to the calling.

telephone will record the called number,

calling

number, date and time of the call and because of the initial busy-

back signal from the called number will record the call as "non-

billable."

no, " Persons inowledgoable of the busy verification.code number

can, by dialing the exchange code,

then the busy verification code

followed by the station code, cut

in on conversations without alerting

the calied subscriber.

Persons using this technique from a distant

point will first dial the area code followed by the same number

sequence mentioned above. If the called telephone line is not busy

at the time a dialed long-distance call is connected to the called

number, the automatic machine accounting equipment will treat the

call as a regularly dialed long-distance call. On the other hand,

if the called line is busy a short busy signal will be sent bacis to

the calling station and then the connector will override the busy

condition without alerting the called subscriber.

In making checks of telephone lines in areas with this

feature you should verify, by dialing in on the busy line from another

station, that the Bureau

line cannot be subjected to this undesirable

override device.

Any technical questions which arise from the survey or

unusual technical data developed as a result of the survey should

be brought to the attention of the Electronics Section, FBI Laboratory.

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES -

'INCOME TAXES

A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

whi h will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal income tax on

mr lies received from the Bureau without jeopardizing their security. This plan

w: ! go into effect immediately in the San Francisco and Philadelphia Offices for

ial period of one year. Payments for services to certain security informants

and sources will be subject to a twenty per cent withholding tax. No tax is to be

withheld from payments made (1) to other than security informants and sources,

(2) for reimbursement of expenses, (3) under the authority of the SAC or (4) to

informants who have been able to report Bureau income on their Federal tax

returns without jeopardizing their security or without challenge from IRS. In

the latter instance, the Bureau must be advised as to the identity of each

informant and the method used by him to report his Bureau income.

Proper records must be maintained of amounts withheld and such

amounts must be placed in a special checking account.

At the end of the tax

year, the tax liability will be determined on money paid by the Bureau to those

informants from whom tax has been withheld. Necessary adjustments will be .

worked out with the informants and the net amount withheld forwarded to the

Bureau. This money will be turned over to a special representative of IRS

without disclosure as to identities of informants, except for coded numbers.

These numbers can later be used for identification purposes in the event it

becomes necessary to substantiate income tax payments.

Other offices may now utilize the withholding system where it

would be helpful; however, where it is not used, continue to instruct all informants

to pay their taxes on income received from the Bureau by such method as may

be proper and feasible.

Detailed instructions and exhibits are enclosed concerning the

procedure to be followed in the accounting and control of money withheld.

WITHHOLDING OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX

FROM PAYMENTS TO INFORMANTS AND SOURCES

INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEDURES

stroduction:

A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service

(IRS) which will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal

income tax on monies received from the Bureau without jeopardizing

their security. This will require the withholding of twenty per cent

of any payments being made to such individuals for services rendered.

Money so withheld will be immediately deposited to a special checking

account, to be used for this purpose

only, set up in the name of the

SAC and ASAC. This account should, if possible, be in a different bank

than that in which the regular office Confidential Fund (blue slip) or

Donhle Agent (white slip), accounts are maintained. Any bank charges

incidental to this special checking account are to be paid from the

regular office Confidential Fund. Attached to these instructions are

10 Exhibits which are to be used as guides in setting up records for

the maintenance and operations of the withholding accounts. Hereafter,

any reference to informants refers to both informants and sources.

This plan will apply only to those informants or groups of

informants authorized by the Bureau.

Accounting Instructions:

When a payment is to be made to an informant subject to this

plan, the amount to be withheld for income tax purposes will be

twenty per cent of the total for services. A check will be drawn on

the regular office Confidential Fund to cover the total amount of the

authorized payment. This

check will be cashed and the amount for taxes

Immediately deposited in the special checking account set up for this

purpose. A duplicate deposit slip is to be obtained for use in posting

to the ledger accounts.

Payment to the informant will then follow and

the receipt to be executed by the informant for such payment should show

not only the amount received as reimbursement for expenses and the

authorized payment for services, but also the amount withheld for

«Federal income tax purposes (Exhibit 1). A Record of Income Tax

Transactions (Exhibits 2 and 3) will be maintained on a calendar-year

basis to record the informant's name, symbol number, period covered,

and the amounts incidental to such transactions. Beginning with the

first payment to an informant involving tax withholding, a new

individual ledger sheet (Exhibits 4 and 5) must be set up. The amount

of money withheld for income tax purposes should

also be listed on

the Blue Slip, Form FD 37, prepared with respect

to the payment

(Exhibit-6).

At the end of each month, entries in the Record of Income Tax

Transactions and the individual informant's ledgers will be totaled

and reconciled. A monthly report (Exhibit 7) is to be mailed to the

Bureau in the same manner as the reports for the regular office

Confidential Fund, no later than the 20th of the following month. All:

payments involving the tax account must be vouchered prior to the

submission of this report.

In the event an informant subject to this plan is transferred

to another field division, all records must be forwarded to the new

field division, together with a check for the amount of income tax

withheld.

Determining Informant's Tax Obligation:

At the end of the tax year, the contacting Agent will obtain

from the informant his compieted Federal income tax return based on

his

regular income, exclusive of money paid to him by the Bureau. The

contacting Agent will not question the accuracy of the return except to

point out

obvious errors. The contacting Agent will furnish the

informant's tax return to a qualified Special Agent Accountant who will

prepare a separate return to include Bureau income. The accountant will

compute the tax owed by informant on the combined earnings. The

difference between the tax computed by the informant and that computed

by the accountant will represent the amount of tax to be paid by the

informant on money received from the Bureau. The accountant who

prepared the retürn will

sign on the line "Signature of. Preparer Other

Than the Taxpayer." The contacting Agent will have the informant sign

the return prepared by the accountant as a certification that the

informant has reviewed it and found it correct in every respect. The

informant will file his original tax return with the Internal Revenue

service (IRS). The return prepared by the accountant, together with a

Photostat of the informant's original return, will be maintained in the

informant's subfile.

If the amount withheld from payments to the informant during

the year exceeds the amount of tax for his Bureau income, the refund

due the informant will be withdrawn from the special checking account

and paid to him at the time he signs the return prepared by the . :

accountant.

A receipt (Exhibit 8) must be obtained from him. If the

amount withheld during the year is not sufficient to cover the tax on

Bureau income, the difference should be collected from the informant

and a statement (Exhibit 9)

obtained from him. Entries for any

-adjustments; either refunds or additional payments, must be made in --

both the informant's ledger (Exhibits 4 and 5) and the Record of

Income Tax Iransactions (Exhibit 2) for the calendar year involved.

Instructions to Informants:

The contacting Agent must fully explain the withholding

procedure to any informant concerned. With regard to the informant's

original tax return, the informant should clearly understand that

Agent of the FBI, since such statement is false and the informant would

be micorered.

Transmittal of Tax to Bureau:

-

After all adjustments have been made in the income tax

withholding or payments to informants, a report of Federal Income Tax

Deductions (Exhibit 10) will be prepared. The net amount of the tax

indicated on the Record of Incone Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2) will

be withdrawn from the special checking account by means of a check made

to the Bureau, together with receipts for refunds that have been made

and statements of additional tax collected. The necessary entries

showing the transmittal of the tax funds to the Bureau should be made in

the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2). When received at

the Bureau, the tax money'

will be turned over to a special representative

of IRS with the amounts for each informant identified by a coded number;

thus, the informant's connection with the FBI will be protected.

However, the coded number can be used for identification purposes in

the event it becomes necessary to substantiate the informant's income tax

payment.

(C) PERSONNEL MATTERS - LEAVE - TRAVEL TIME -- Effective immediately,

an employee who drives his personally owned automobile in effecting

travel on official transfer will be granted travel time, without

charge to leave, equal to the actual driving time, provided he

averages a minimum of 300 miles per day for the direct route aistance.

The travel time starts when he departs

on transfer.

To illustrate

this policy, the following examples are furnished:

An employee departed Washington, D: C., on a Saturday at

8 a.m., driving his personally owned automobile en route to New

Orleans, Louisiana, on official transfer, and arrived at 7 p.m.

the following Monday.

Since he traveled

1,103 miles and his

daily

average was within the 300-mile requirement, no annual leave would

be charged.

However, if during the travel period the

employee

decided to

stop over

in Knoxville, Tennessee, for two days and

therefore did not report for work in New Orleans until Thursday

morning, annual leave would be charged for two days (Tuesday and

Wednesday).

If the employee performs indirect travel in effecting a

transfer, travel time allowable will be determined by applying the

300-mile-a-day average over the direct route distance.

Excess time involving workdays will be a charge against

annual leave.

As an example of this situation, an employee who

departed

Washington, D. C., on a Saturday for New Orleans, traveled

via Miami, Florida, and reported for duty in New Orleans at the

beginning of the workday the following Friday.

He would only be

entitled to travel time through Monday. Therefore, Tuesday,

Wednesday and Thursday would be charged to annual leave.

vigorous

action by U.S. Attorneys

lations of the National Bankruptcy Act (NBA) is closely reviewing

all Bureau NBA reports with particular attention being given to

those wherein the U. S. Attorney declines prosecution.

therewith the Department has adopted a form letter addressed to the

U. S. Attorney and signed by Assistant Attorney General, Criminal

DivIsIOn, which states in part:

"It is our opinion that the declination as set

forth in the said FBI report does not conform to the

that in declining prosecution in bankruptcy matters

that cogent and reasonably detailed reasons for such

facts of the case shall be reported to the Attorney

General. (1) by report

to the FBI or (2) by letter

addressed to the Criminal Division, Department of

Jústice: "

In keeping with the foregoing, it is imperative that in

reasons for so doing are set forth in sufficient detail to permit

adequate evaluation thereof by the Department.

(F) : INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF GAMBLING DEVICES - DEPARTMENTAL

OPINION CONCERNING GAMBLING WHEELS - Based on an inquiry from the

field as to whether gambling wheels a device sometimes known as

a wheel of fortune, are gambling devices falling within the purview

of the Interstate Transportation of Gambling Devices Statute, the

Department has furnished an opinion that such gambling wheels do

fall, within the purview of the 1962 amendments to

this statute.

This type of gambling wheel contains a series of numbers,

which numbers correspond to a board on which a sum of money is placed

on a particular number by the participant or customer. After the

wheel is spun and stops on a particular number, the corresponding number

on the board determines the winner. The winner, in turn, receives

money or merchandise.

The Department advises the statute covers any mechanical

device which is designed and manufactured for use in connection with

ga' sling. Further, since the device is mechanical in nature it is

ay arently designed primarily for use in connection with gambling,

a d that by its operation a person who has paid the requisite con-

.sideration may become entitled to receive, as a result of the

-pplication of an element of chance, money or property.

In view of the Department's opinion, when complaints are

received.concerning gambling wheels, develop the facts and promptly

contact the U. S. Attorney for his prosecutive opinion.

At the

same time promptly advise the Bureau of such investigations.

radio personnel having

to monitoring technical surveillances, assigned to headquarters city

with the exception of those working outside of the divisional head-

quarters in excess of 24 hours, including absence in another division

for the purpose of testifying.

They will, of course, continue to be

submitted by those personnel enumerated above who are assigned to

resident agencies. Consequently, the Number Three (Locator Card)

Register will be used by those investigative personnel now exemoted

from the submission of daily reports to indicate, in addition to

those items presently entered thereon, their times of initial arrival

and final departure and their daily tabulations of voluntary overtime

and time in the office. Therefore, from now on, the Number Three

Registers will be retained for a period of two years after which

they will be destroyed on a monthly or other staggered basis if

preferred.

In connection with the tabulation of time spent in the

office, in addition to those activities presently excluded, it will

no longer be necessary to incluäe time spent therein on key inter-

views of subjects and witnesses, regularly scheduled conferences,

and the review of accountancy-type books and records.

Further, it will no longer be necessary for agents to

compute each day the total time spent on the development of potential

criminal informants or potential security informants.

The elimination of these requirements in no way mitigates

the necessity to insure that time in the office is kept at an

absolute minimum and that agents are held accountable for any

unjustifiable time so spent. With respect to the development of

potential informants, both criminal and security, you are reminded

that they are vital to success in the discharge of our investigative

responsibilities and you must continue to stress the importance of

these programs.

Appropriate manual changes incorporating the foregoing

Information are being prepared for issuance in the near future.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

File No.

(A) VISITS BY CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO FIELD OFFICES AND RESIDENT

AGENCIES -- On August 29, 1963, a group of Negroes, identified as the

"Freedom Now Movement," headed by Conrad J. Lynn, a New York attorney,

called at my office. Previously the Bureau had learned that this group might

pr ,sibly institute a "sit-in" demonstration.

The group, upon arrival at 9:10 a.m., was courteously greeted

nd promptly ushered into my office.

At that time, Mr. Lynn indicated that the

Jegro considered there was a lack of law enforcement on the part of the FBI,

articularly with respect to prosecution of state and city police officials in civil

rights cases. He, and other members of the group, talked about a number of

cases, asserting that the FBI had not measured up to its responsibilities. William

Worthy, a newspaperman who has been most critical of American foreign policy

and who in 1962 was found guilty of traveling from Cuba to Miami, Florida, with-

out a valid passport, was most sarcastic. He stated that he was disturbed that

the FBI had not "prosecuted" anyone as a result of the "literally hundreds of

bombings of Negro churches and homes throughout the country. " Worthy added

thai it was only fair to lot merknow there was a rising tide of criticism against

the FBI because of our failure to "prosecute." Worthy stated that while he was

making no threat, he prophesied that FBI offices would be picketed in the future.

He specifically menticned the incident in which a demonstration was held at our

Resident Agency at Danville, Virginia.

I told the group that I was happy to have the opportunity to

answer their questions. I explained the FBI's jurisdiction and that we were

an investigative and not a prosecutive agency. I emphasized that our investi-

gations were penetrative in both the South and the North and that we constantly

• impress upon our Agents that they must be completely objective in all investi-

gations, especially those involving civil rights. I told them that in many instances

erroneous statements are made by extremists concerning the FBI's role in the

civil rights field. I furnished facts regarding some specific cases they men-

tioned, and have since forwarded a letter to the leader of this group setting

forth the facts in each case. As it turned out, the FBI had previously investi-

gated each case the group brought up and the results of our investigations had

been forwarded to the Department of Justice for consideration as to prosecution

or further action.

The possibility exists that representatives of the "Freedom Now

Movement"' or other groups might call at our Field Offices or Resident Agencies.

If they do, they are to be promptly and courteously received.. The Special Agent

1 55044 DocId: 32989526 Page 1266

## Page 1267

in Charge or the Senior Resident Agent, if available, is to conduct the interview.

The group should be allowed to state the reason for its visit and its complaints

heard. The Bureau's jurisdiction in the civil rights field should be thoroughly

explained and questions in regard to the specific cases mentioned answered. -

If the interviewing Bureau official does not possess the facts on the cases, the

group should be told that he will promptly check the matter and advise it of the

true facts. Keep in mind the possibility of furnishing the group literature such

as my recent article in the August, 1963, issue of "Yale Political" magazine

concerning civil rights. At all times, the group should receive courteous

attention and every effort made to assist its members in understanding the

FBI's role in the civil rights field. The Bureau should be promptly advised

of each such interview.

It is felt that by such an approach, not only can the Bureau

forestall any "sit-ins" and unfavorable publicity, but do much to enable Negro

sarge, t91

leaders -to-understand the true rnle.of the FBI in these investigations.

One Field Division recently conducted a very successful three-day

seminar for police training directors which evoked considerable

Interest and enthusiasm. Purpose of seminar was to bring together

local law enforcement training directors for purpose of discussing

teaching methods, techniques and training programs.

Attendance

was restricted to officers who handle training in their departments;

the 30 men in attendance represented 28 law enforcement agencies.

Although we coordinated the program and presented a substantial

amount of the instruction, several competent, cooperative police

training directors led discussions on topics

which, logically, they could

handle.

Curriculum included such topics

as The Police Training

(E) COMMUNIST PARTY, USA - NEGRO QUESTION - COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN

RACIAL MATTERS -- The history of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA),

Is replete with its attempts to exploit, influence and recrult the

Negro.

The March on Washirgton, August 28, 1963, was a striking

example as party leaders early put into motion efforts to accrue

gains for the CPUSA from the March. The presence at the March of

headed by CPUSA General Secretary

members, is clear indication of the Party's favorite target (the

Negro today.

All Indications are that the March was not the "end

of the line" and that the Party will step up its efforts to exploit

racial unrest and in every possible way claim credit for Itself

relating to any

, "gains" achieved by the Negro. A clear-cut

indication of

the Party's designs is revealed in secret information.

obtained from a most sensitive source that the Party plans to hold

a highly secretive leadership meeting in November, 1963, which will

deal primarily with the Negro situation. The Party has

closely guardec

plans for Gus Hall to undertake a "barnstorming" trip through key

areas of the country io mect Party people and thus better prepare

himself for the November meeting.

In order for the Bureau to cope with the Party's efforts

• and thus fulfill our responsibilities in the security field, it is

necessary that we at once intensify our coverage of communist

influence on the Negro.

Fullest consideration should be given to

the use of all possible investigative techniques in the investigation

of the CPUSA, those communist fronts through which the Party channels

its influence, and the many individual Party members and dupes.

There is also

an urgent need for imaginative and aggressive tactics

•to be utilized through our Counterintelligence Program for the

purpose of attempting to neutralize or disrupt the Party's

activities in the Negro field. Because of the Bureau's responsibility

for timely dissemination of pertinent information to the Department

and

other interested agencies; it is more than ever necessary that.

all facets of this matter receive prompt handling.

Because of the Party's intensified efforts to render in-

forces; expand and improve political activities; win additional forces

to an outlook of Marxism-Leninism and increase the open advocacy of

socialism; develop a significant Marxist-Leninist program for the

(A) EMERGENCY MEDICAL IDENTIFICATION CARDS -- The American

Medical Association has approved the use of a universal symbol to be used

as a warning that any individual wearing or carrying it suffers from a

physical disability or illness requiring special care such as, diabetes,

epilepsy, allergy to certain drugs or medications, et cetera. The symbol

may appear on an idertification card or be affixed to a bracelet, pin, or

similar ornamental device and consists of a hexagon on which has been

superimposed a six-sided cross, "the Star of Life," on the upright arm

of which is a staff with a serpent entwined about it, "the Staff of Aesculapius."

Although the American Medical Association is unable to state the

extent of the use of the symbol; it has and will be given considerable publicity.

schools on police subjects for municipal, county, State and Federal law

enforcement officers having arrest powers, and for foreign officials having

law enforcement duties. This brochure gives no irdication who will be

connected with NAI; however, it was determined it is apparently a private

undertaking by Neal M. Forrey, a National Academy graduate no longer

active in law enforcement, and has no connection with any law enforcement

agency, organization or college. Forney plans to set up his Institute in

Washington, D. C., but has indicated he will present instruction in other

areas, if requested. Registration for the initial school closes 1/13, 64;

tuition for each school will be $185.

You should make no comment at this time concerning this proposed

police training organization, but you should be alert for information regarding

Forney and NAI and advise the Bureau promptly. You are again reminded to

insure that the police training program of your office is meeting the training

needs of local law enforcement in your area.

(C; BANK ROBBERY MATTERS + It has been suggested that bait money

used by banks should be made up of used Federal Reserve Notes emanating

from Federal Reserve Districts far removed from the area in which the

bait money is being used. It is felt this procedure would help our bank

robbery investigations in that it would be easier for tellers in other banks

to check bills received against lists of stolen bait money. Since each Federal

Reserve Note contains a large letter on its face denoting the Federal Reserve

District from which it came, and those from districts far removed from

locality in question would be received in relatively small volumes, the money

used in bait packages could be more easily detected.

Accordingly, this proposal is brought to your attention for discussion

with appropriate officials of banking institutions within your territory during

the normal course of business or in connection with field conterences.

(D) HOODLUM COVERAGE IN THE GREATER MIAMI, FLORIDA, AREA

DURING WINTER SEASON 1963-1964 - CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE

PROGRAM -- The Miami Office has been making plans to affora coverage

of the activities öf out-of-town hoodlums who may visit the Miami area during

the coming winter season. These plans include the utilization of informants

• and sources in places frequented by racketeers and development of information

to establish highly confidential investigative techniques.

To assist the Miami Office in the prompt establishment of effective

coverage on hoodlums and racketeers proceeding to the Miami area, field

offices are instructed to furnish to the Miami Office background information,

including criminal records, physical descriptions and details of itineraries

of such hoodlums. When information is received from highly sensitive sources

or informants concerning the travel of any hoodlum, appropriate precautions

should be set forth to enable the Miami Office to plan investigative steps which

will not jeopardize these sources and informants. Information on travel pians

should be forwarded expeditiously by appropriate communication to enable the

Miami Office to have as much notice as possible to provide coverage on the

activities of these individuals where facts have been developed indicating the

desirability of such coverage. To make coverage more efficient and discreet,

the information developed should include identity of associates the traveling

hoodlums are expected to meet in the Miami area. All surveillances instituted

must be discreet and based on information from which it can logically be

inferred that there is a definite, useful objective to be achieved.

All of ces should furnish a brief outline to Miami of public source

data identifying any of these individuals as racketeers or members of organized

criminal groups, such as La Cosa Nostra, to be made available, if necessary,

to local law enforcement officials.

It should be borne in mind that hoodlums from various parts of the

country visiting the Miami area will be renewing associations, reminiscing

about past experiences and discussing future plans. This recreation atmosphere

should provide better opportunities for our informants

and sources to obtain

valuable information in accordance with the objectives of the Criminal

Intelligence Program.

When notifying the Bureau and Miami Office of the intended travel

of hoodlums, each field office should include information on the availability of

any highly placed informants in a position to travel to Florida to provide coverage

of hoodlum activities. The Bureau will thereafter decide if the travel of a

particular informant is warranted.

(B) REPORT WRITING -- To avoid unnecessary dictation and typing,

the attention of all investigative personnel should be directed to the

general reporting rules set forth in the Handbook for FBI Agents.

Particular emphasis should be placed on the provisions embodied in

Part I, item 47, A, 10 and 11, on pages 32c and 32d of the Handbook

s they relate to the use of inserts by auxiliary offices to report-the

results of investigations to an office of origin.

Good judgment should dictate the use of inserts wherever

possible to report information ultimately destined for inclusion in a report.

This will relieve the office preparing the report of the necessity of

wholesale retyping of information to include it therein as is the case

when the data is received from the auxiliary office in an airtel, letter,

or similar communication.

(D) PHOTOGRAPHS - INVESTIGATIVE AID -- It has been brought to our

attention that the State of Montana has adopted the practice of requiring

that a photograph of the driver be attached to the operator and chauffeur

driving licenses issued by it. The licenses expire every two years and

applicants are photographed at the time of initial application and each

renewal.

Montana thus joins several other states which have this

requirement and, with the increasing trend toward uniformity in

licensing procedures, it is anticipated that many more states will adopt

this requirement in the future.

I need not elaborate on the value to our investigations of

up-to-date photographs of subjects, suspects, et cetera, and you are

reminded that all logical sources of obtaining them, such as that

described above, should be exploited whenever possible.

(F) SECURITY INDEX -- In connection with all security investigations

in the case of individual subjects, the essential question for determination

is whether the subject's activities are such as to depict him to be a

potential danger to the national security of the United States in time

of an emergency. In the event such a determination is made, his name

should be included in the Security Index.

The Security Index criteria have been found to afford

practical and workable guidelines in arriving at a conclusion as to

whether a subject represents a potential danger and are sufficiently

elastic so that when applied with the necessary judgment, the complex

questions which may arise in connection with these cases can be

resolved.

Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions contains a number

of specific factors that must betaken into consideration when arriving

at a conclusion as to whether a particular subject meets the Security Index

criteria and represents a potential threat to the national security.

For your assistance, the assistance of your investigative

personnel engaged in security work, and for the assistance of your

supervisory staff, the following specific factors, in addition to the ones

presently enumerated in Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions, are

set forth for consideration in arriving at a determination as to whether

a security subject falls within the Security Index criteria, represents

a potential danger in time of an emergency, and thus should be included

in the Security Index.

(1) Contacts with Sino-Soviet-bloc establishments

(including Cuba) where purpose of contact cannot

•be determined or contact indicates communist

sympathies.

(2) Contacts with Sino-Soviet-bloc, Cuban or Yugoslav

- intelligence agents where purpose of contact cannot..

• be determined or contact indicates communist

sympathies.

(3) Individuals who have defected, revoked or sought

revocation of their United States citizenship in

favor of a Sino-Soviet-bloc country, who have

returned to the United States, and who have taken

no positive steps to counteract such action.

(4)

Statements or activities on a subject's part

establishing reasonable grounds to believe that

his loyalty would lie with a Sino-Soviet-bloc

country in the event of armed conflict between

the United States and a Sino-Soviet-bloc country.

(5) Training and/or participation in espionage,

sabotage, or intelligence activities.

(6)

A history of emotional instability or irrational

behavior on the part of an individual with a

subversive background whose prior acts depict

a propensity for violence and hatred against

organized government.

The above factors, including the various factors presently

set forth in Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions, are not all-inclusive

but are set forth for the purpose of providing a more detailed guideline

and all must be considered in evaluating the facts developed during

the course of the investigation.

In view of our responsibilities in the internal security field,

most careful attention must be afforded this aspect of our operations

and all security cases should be closely examined for the purpose of

determining whether sufficient facts are available to depict the subject

as a dangerous person whose activities warrant the inclusion of his

name in the Security Index. When such a determination is made,

appropriate recommendation to include his name in the Security Index

should be made promptly.

RE: MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCES

You are reminded that whenever requesting authority

to install a microphone

surveillance of any kind, complete

details of the proposed installation must be furnished,

specifically pointing out if trespass is Involved and whether

the microphone will be installed in the telephone or a tele

phone instrument will be utilized In any way. Mere statements

that trespass is not involved or that microphone will be in-

stalled in a living room are not sufficient. Bureau desires

specific details of each contemplated installation.

In addition, when advising that a microphone

surveillance has

been

discontinued state whether you have been

able to remove all equipment at the time of discontinuance.

--It Is realized that due to lack of maximum security such removal

may not be immediately effected and if such is the case keep

the Bureau advised every 15 days after discontinuance of efforts

being made to remove all evidence of the microphone surveillance.

Each Special Agent In Charge must continue to personally

supervise all microphone surveillances and the Bureau will closely

scrutinize each installation and discontinuance to insure that

you are acting in compliance with the foregoing.

PERSONNEL MATTER - LIMITED DUTY AGENTS - PREMIUM OVERTIME

I am concerned over the number of Special Agents whose physical

limitations prohibit them from discharging the normal, everyday

responsibilities expected of our agent personnel: In

instances physical limitations not only restrict such agents from

performing arduous duties but also result in only token compliance

with overtime requirements toward premium pay.

You should of course insure that each limited duty agent

is assigned duties consistent with his physical limitations.

Each SAC should immediately review the performance of

all limited duty agents within his office to ascertain in what

respects the agent's physical limitations prevent him from handling

all duties and overtime responsibilities inherent in the Special

Agent position. In those instances where it is found that the

Special Agent's physical disability prevents him from completely

"discharging normal agent-duties including equitably sharing the

office overtime, you should carefully analyze his case to determine

1f he 1s, in fact

fulfilling all requirements necessary to qualify

for premium overtime pay.

Should it appear that his physical

condition precludes his meeting all necessary requirements to

qualify for premium pay benefits, he should not continue to be

certified for such benefits.

Particular attention should be given

to those who are consistently below the office average overtime.

The mere fact that he performs the amount of overtime necessary

to qualify for premium pay is not sufficient. He must meet the

necessary requirements as to frequency and type of overtime called

for by the fringe Benerits Act.

This would include availability

for weekend and emergency duty beyond normal working hours.

You should immediately submit your comments to the

Bureau as to each limited duty agent in line with the foregoing,

together with your recommendations concerning. his

continued

eligibility for premium

pay benefits.

Very truly yours,

File No.

(A) POSITION CLASSIFICATION MATTERS - GRADE GS 4 AND GS 5 FIELD

STENOGRAPHER POSITIONS -- Enclosed are two copies each of master

descriptions for Clerk-Stenographer GS 4 and Clerk-Stenographer

GS 5 positions in the feld office stenographie-pools. It is

desired that the GS 4 position be utilized in lieu of existing

GS 4 stenographer positions in the stenographic pools.

This will

permit use of one standardized-type position description for all

field offices instead of having individual positions on record for

each office. Forward to the Bureau the two copies of the properly

executed Position Description Form FD-243 (i.e., have appropriate

employees sign lines 5, 6 and T) and identify by official position

title and number position(s), occupied or vacant, which are to be

absorbed by the master description.

Bureau records will be adjusted

to reassign the employees occupying the positions listed.

Bureau has secured Civil Service Commission approval for

aGS 5 straight stenographic position in the field office steno-

graphic pools.

Duties of position are set out in the enclosed

position description for Clerk-Stenographer GS 5. Principal

distinctions between the GS 4 and the GS 5 positions are:

(1) the

GS 5 takes somewhat more complex dictation at 120 words per minute

as compared with 80 words per minute for the GS 4; (2) production

of the GS 5 normally exceeds that of the GS 4 stenographer in a

given field office by 20 to 30% or more; (3) the GS 5 makes less

frequent reference to the stenographers'

manual and requires less

supervision; (4) the GS 5 must have served approximately a year

as a GS 4 Bureau stenographer; and (5) the GS 5 prepares certain

forms, airtels, letters, memoranda, and the like, on own initiative

or on very general instructions.

Forward to the Bureau the two copies of properly executed

FD-243 and identify the employees who are qualified for and whom

you recommend for promotion to the grade GS 5 position. Include

the 120 word-per-minute stenographic test, information

regarding

production, and usual justification for those who are to be promoted.

The new Clerk-Stenographer GS 5 position will replace the position

of Confidential Clerk (Stenography) GS 5 referred to in SAC Letter

58-42 (B) in offices having such a position unless there are cir-

cumstances in any particular office which would make such action

undesirable. In the absence of such circumstances Bureau will

adjust its records to show that all incumbents of the existing

Confidential Clerk position are assigned to the Clerk-Stenographer

GS 5 position when the latter is placed on record.

If all incumbents

of the Confidential Clerk (Stenography) GS 5 position do not presently

meet production and other requirements of new Clerk-Stenographer GS 5

position, you should advise the Bureau and take immediate steps

to see that employees become qualified.

Duties as set forth in the master descriptions are not

to be amended or changed in any way; however, this does not

preclude using the incumbents on commensurate grade-level duties

of temporary emergency nature.

Your replies are to be received

by the Bureau, marked to attention of Personnel Section, Within

30 days after

receipt of this letter.

SAC LETTER NO. 60-12

(B) : FOREIGN LANGUAGE TRAINING PROGRAM -- It has been incumbent

upon us to gradually extend this program for purpose of assuring

our investigative responsibilities are discharged effectively.

You should know, however, that results of field-wide surveys con-

ducted during past year

for candidates to attend foreign language

schools - excepting case of Spanish - have been disappointing

with regard to both quantity and quality of personnel, and

fol-

lowing items being brought to your attention at this

time.

Selection of Agents for training is a most important

aspect which involves several considerations. First, it is

Bureau's desire to train volunteers whenever possible since

volunteers more than likely will have essential degree of interest.

In addition, emphasis is placed on language background, scholastic

achievement, availability, initiative, physical fitness, Reserve

status and

general over-all Bureau performance.

Finally, con-

siderable weight is given your personal recommendation with respect

to whether you feel candidate can successfully assimilate training.

Bearing in mind our investigative staff is composed primarily

of lawyers and accountants rather than linguists, it has been

Bureau's experience two essential characteristics for prospective

• trainees are motivation and above-average intelligence. To propose

employee for some other reason such as first-office Agent because

he will soon be due for transfer accomplishes nothing.

To propose

employee who already has another language skill used from day to

day would certainly appear questionable if thereafter Bureau would

have to train replacement. Careful selection of candidates is

basis of successful program. This important step must be initially

resolved in field. You are in by far best position to recommend

most promising candidates.

All necessary measures being taken to anticipate and

fill future needs for personnel capable of handling such specialized

work by continuing program of instruction. Bureau intends to

maintain sufficient staff to provide for rotation on several

types of assignments involved in foreign language field and

avoid, for example, situation where Agent remains ior undue

period on technical

surveillance because no other qualified

e ployee available to handle job. Quite to contrary, realizing

I creau must derive equal return on investment-by-using for

easonable time skills these men have acquired at Government

expense, language training should in no way adversely affect

Agent by interfering with administrative advancement or ultimate

transfer to office of preierence. In this continuing program,

divisions with appreciable work in foreign language field should

have enough qualitied personnel to meet their needs, treredy re-

ducing to minimum movement of Agents on special assignmert from

one office to another.

From realistic standpoint, however, there

must be suificient work to keep employee gainfully occupied in

foreign language field.and preclude gradual loss of linguistic

fluency.

From Agent's

individual

standpoint, successful completion

of Bureau school in which he becomes equipped to capably handle

foreign language assignments is not only gratis educasion in itself

but one

for which he has actually been paid suostantial salary

to acquire, and benefits Agent personally by hoadening his back-

ground and experience.

Agents with capacity in foreign languages

are invaluable to Bureau and decided assets to field's investigative

potential. By volunteering for such intensive tralning, norever,

I realize Agent demonstrates most commendable attitude in o_fering

to assist Bureau and Bureau does not intend to overlook this.

As result of recent, survey to determine Bureau's langiage

needs projected over next two years,

arrangements being made for

following courses at Army Language School, Monterey, California:

Albanian; Chinese, Mandarin dialect; Chinese, Toyshan dialect;

Czech; Hungarian; Polish; Rumanian; Serbo-Croatian. These require

forty-seven weeks except

Rumanian which is of thirty-seven weeks'

duration. Candidates must be available without qualification

and must execute agreement to remain in Bureau for three years upon

completion of training.

Canvass all Agents and furnish Bureau,

attention FBI Laboratory, by March 15, 1900, names of those interested

in above schools together with comments on:

(1) availability of

each man; (2) his motivation, initiative, physical fitness, language

background, Reserve status; (3) whether

you feel he could success-

fully assimilate training; (4) your personal recommendation ac-

companied in unfavorable

cases by reasons therefor.

(D) INVESTIGATIONS OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATIONS - INTERNAL

SECURITY -- Recent anti-Semitic Incidents have received

nationwide publicity.

The Communist Party (CP), always alert to capitalize

on any event which may cause or increase discord among the so-

called minority groups, and for any evidence of the revival of

fascism, has been publicizing those incidents. It is possible

the CP

may form Iront organizations to-further-spread the

publicity efforts of the CP.

Also, those incidents may stimulate

the formation of organizations

similar to the former German-

American Bund.

You should be alert to the formation of any subversive

organizations in this regard. Information relating to such

organizations should be submitted to the Bureau promptly under

caption of the individual organization. Your comnunication should

set forth all information available concerning the organization,

reflects Bureau currently receiving from field approximately 250

pieces of registered mail per month with Post Office return-

receipt cards attached for which no apparent need can be discerned

requiring use of such receipt cards. These cards cost 10 cents

each.

Existing manual instructions require only that Post

Office return receipt cards be used for transmission of confidential

(B)': RADIO - POLICE RADIOS IN BUREAU CARS -- Due to the increasing

need for additional communications channels, the Federal Com-

munications Commission (FCC) has ruled that state and local police

agencies must fully convert to narrow-band (split-channel)

operation on or before November 1, 1963. In order to accomplish

this, existing police frequency wide-band equipment must be

modified or replaced with new narrow-band equipment.

One provision of the FCC ruling requires that police

departments operating on frequencies above 42 mc. must reduce

transmitter deviation to plus or minus 5 kc. on or before August

1, 1960. This is only a partial transition to full narrow-band

operation and can be accomplished in most instances by adjustment

of the modulation control on wide-band transmitters.

1s the only requirement which must be met by the August I, 1900,

date, It is possible that some police agencies will take

additional

steps to improve operational efficiency and some agencies will

probably make the full narrow-band conversion by that date.

Other

agencies, particularly those operating on frequencies below 42 mc.,

possibly will not fully convert to narrow-band operation until

the November 1, 1963, deadline.

The Bureau equipment operating on police frequencies

must be modified or replaced with narrow-band equipment at such

time as the change to narrow-band operation is made by the respective

police agencies. It is contemplated that Bureau equipment

will be changed

to the same extent and at the same time as the

change is made by police agencies.

Since the receiver conversion is the most expensive

phase of the change from wide-band to full narrow-band operation,

It Is: expected that many police agencies will not-fully convert

wide-band receivers until sometime after August 1, 1960. How-

ever, minor changes to increase the audio recovery of receivers

will probably be necessary when the transmitter deviation is

reduced to plus or minus 5 kc.

Some of the Bureau equipment operating on police

frequencies is nearing the end of

its useful life.

thererore,

It is anticipated that after July 1, 1960, some of the older

units can be replaced with new equipment.

In view of this,

such time as new equipment can be furnished.

You should maintain close liaison with police agencies

sil whose frequencies Bureau equipment is operating so as to be

aware of the steps to be taken toward narrow-band conversion by

the police agencies.

This information, as soon as available, -

should be furnished

the Bureau with the number, make and model

•¿ Bureau radios which must be modified or replaced in order

to continue operations on the police trequency.

There is attached further information regarding narrow

band conversion of mobile radio equipment presently in use by

the Bureau on police frequencies. This attachment should be

brought to the attention of your Electronics Maintenance Technician

or other interested personnel for use in requesting narrow-band

conversion kits from the Bureau when needed.

Such inaccurate appraisals can be a definite threat to effective

As the recognized leader in establishing and fostering

better cooperation in the law enforcement field, it is imperative

that we not allow the American people to be unaware of this

cooperation. We must insure that all law enforcement agencies

are fully acquainted with all of our cooperative functions and

that the public is informed regarding our accomplishments in this

regard. Too, we must not create or allow to exist any impression

that we do not receive excellent cooperation and assistance from

other law enforcement agencies.

Each Bureau speaker and police instructor should en-

deavor to work into every appearance some reference to cooperation,

citing, where practical, actual cases in which success has been

realized as a result of members of different agencies working

together.

The various booklets, reprints, interesting case write-

ups and

similar items which are

sent to you from time to time

contain a wealth of excellent material which can be used in this

regara. In addition to stressing the topic of cooperation in

public appearances, each Special Agent should be alert

for

opportunities to emphasize the proven value of cooperation

among law enforcement agencies during his dally contacts.

With respect to the booklets and reprints which are

ssued at the Seat of Government, these are of no value whatever

inless they are placed In the hands of persons who have an-

interest in the contents.

Many of these items are written

especially for police officers, prosecuting attorneys, United

States attorneys and other persons associated with law enforcement

work, and whenever there is a change of personnel in these

positions, the new individuals should be furnished copies. As

new and revised booklets and reprints are sent to you, they should

be distributed to all appropriate persons.

One of the best methods of informing the public about

the extent of cooperation between the FBI and other agencies is

through feature stories in newspapers and other publications.

You should immediately take steps to encourage newspapers in your

area to publish feature articles which point out the effectiveness

of cooperation in the fight against crime. Friendly local.

authorities should be encouraged to "talk up" cooperation during

their daily contacts and especially in their dealings with

representatives of the press.

(F) DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR MOTOR VEHICLES - Recent major

commercial aircraft disasters and

their resultant tragic loss of

life are matters of grave concern.

In view of their importance

and

the necessity that the Bureau be in a position to investigate

any violations arising from such disasters efficiently and ag

gressively, the following procedures are to be placed into effect

Immediately.

Action To Be Taken By SAC

The SAC will

1.

Immediately advise the Bureau by telephone of any

major commercial aircraft disaster;

2.

Immediately thereafter proceed to the scene of the

disaster in order to develop any information indicating

a Federal violation within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

To this end he will

?. Establish close liaison with local law enforce-

ment officers and Civil Aeronauüics Board (EAB)-

authorities in order to insure that evidence

1s properly identified and protected. This will

materially aid those responsible for examining

the evidence among whom will be a representative

of the Bureau Laboratory.

-

b. Closely follow investigation by CAB authorities

to insure that full scale Bureau investigation

is initiated immediately upon receipt of

Indication that a violation has occurred:

c.

Arrange to obtain a passenger manifest and

Initiate whatever inquiries are necessary to

determine sufficient background data concerning

each passenger so that an immediate and efficient

check may be made of Bureau indices and the

Indices of the field office covering the residence

of the passenger.

This action will assist the

Bureau Disaster Squad in its efforts to positively

Identify passengers killed or injured in the

crash, and develop at the earliest possible moment

¡ pertinent data in Bureau files indicating the

possibility of an actual violation.

d.

Personally direct appropriate investigative

activity of any matters within our jurisdiction

to Insure same is handled expeditiously.

e.

Afford on-the-spot direction to logical immediate

investigative activity pertinent to determining

whether a violation within Bureau's

jurisdiction

has occurred. Consideration should be given to

the following:

(I) Preparation of appropriate photographs of

and sketches of the scene of the crash and

photographs of pertinent portions of the

aircraft.

•(2)

Interviews with survivors, eye witnesses,

individuals who heard the plane before the

crash.

Press Inquiries

The Special Agent in Charge should respond to any press

inquiries received by indicating that he has arrived at the scene

to develop any information indicating a Federal violation. It

should also be stated that the Special Agent in Charge is extending

the cooperative facilities of the FBI Laboratory and Identification

Division.

Action To Be Taken By Laboratory Representative

Henceforth in connection with each major commercial air-

craft disaster, a representative from the FBI Laboratory will

accompany members of the Bureau Disaster Squad to the scene. The

representative of the Laboratory will

1. Effect technical liaison with interested

Government representatives.

2. Render all possible assistance on the scene to

such authorities and where desired arrange for

the use of the facilities of the FBI Laboratory.

3. In relation to the Bureau's interests, evaluate

technical problems associated with Laboratory

matters and evidence at the scene.

4. Keep the Special Agent In Charge advised of

pertinent developments in the technical in-

vestigation so that if a violation 1s indicated

investigation may be initiated at the earliest

possible moment.

The Bureau desires and expects the Special Agent In

Charge to personally take command in relation to the Bureau's

interests in these instances; however, necessary action cannot

be delayed due to his absence.

These matters must be handled in a vigorous and

expeditious manner to insure that the Bureau's interests are

fully protected.

(B) PHYSICAL EXAMINATION MATTERS - WEIGHT STANDARDS -- There have

been some recent indications that all Special Agents are not aware

of the Bureau's weight standards and requirements,

new weight chart

ao contained on FD-300 revised 2-9-60, and Bureau's desire that

all Special Agents be within desirable weight limits. It should

be the goal of every Special Agent to renain within desirable weight

iimits.

Insure that all Special Agents and officials are well

aware of these aspects as contained in SAC letters 59-58 (I) and -

60-10(B). In the future, lack of knowledge on the part of any

Special Agent as to the Bureau's weight standards and weight goal

will

not be accepted as an excuse for failure to comply.

The Bureau has noted too many recent instances of

division heads lackadaisically submitting medical reports concerning

Special Agents where the report clearly shows that the employee

exceeds the desirable weight linit and no acuion has been taken

or recommendation made. It is again reiterated that it is your

prime responsibility to take the appropriate action or submit

an appropriate recommendation in such cases. You should take

steps to insure that either you of the ASAC has medical reports

in such cases referred to you before transmittal to the Bureau

to insure such action rather than leaning on the Bureau to initiate

the appropriate action. It will be necessary to consider admini-

• strative action in the event future failures are noted.

(C) SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS - RESERVE INDEX -- .

The presently constituted Communist Index will henceforth be known

as the "Reserve Index."

Institute a review of the Reserve Index.

In conducting

his review the following minimum steps are-to be taken-in-all

instances.

1. Verify residence and employment.

2. Conduct an indices search and file review to

determine whether investigation is warranted at this

time or whether an interview with the individual is

deemed desirable. Interviews with the individuals will

be handled in accordance with current Bureau instructions

set forth in Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions.

3. If additional investigation is conducted or

•- If there is unreported information of a subversive nature

contained in the files, a report must be suomitted.

The re-examination of the Reserve Index may be made in

equal monthly divisions for one year. Advise the Bureau quarterly

of your progress.

Recognizing that some individuals included in the Reserve

Index represent

a greater potential threat in time of an emergency

than do others, this Reserve Index is being divided into two

sections, Section A and Section B. Each is discussed separately

herein.

SECTION A

Section A of the Reserve Index is designed to represent

a special group of individuals who should receive priority con-

sideration with respect to investigation and/or other action fol-

lowing the apprehension of our Security Index subjects.

Section A of the Reserve Index should include those

Individuals whose subversive activities do not bring them within

the Security Index criteria, but who, in a time of national

emergency, are in a position to influence others against the

national interest or are likely to furnish material financial

aid to subversive elements due to their subversive associations

and ideology. Included in Section A will be those Individuals

falling within the following categories:

1. Professors, teachers and educators.

2. Labor union organizers or leaders.

3. Writers, lecturers, newsmen, entertainers

and others in the mass media field.

4

Lawyers, doctors

and scientists.

5.

Other potentially influential persöns on

a local or national level.

6.

Individuals who could potentially furnish

material financial aid.

During the course of the re-examination of the Reserve

Index, those individuals falling within the above criteria for

Inclusion in section A should be selected therefrom, handled in

accordance with the above instructions and, thereafter, nominated

for inclusion in Section A of the Reserve Index.

Appropriate

forms for this purpose will be forwarded all offices in the

Immediate future.

Attached to the form recommending the inclusion

of the individual's name in Section A of the Reserve Index should

be a succinct summary setting forth the basis for your recom

mendation.

It no further

investigation is warranted in the case

at.

this time or if no report is accompanying the recommendation,

a statement to that effect should appear on the page containing

the succinct summary.

Investigations of individuals listed in Section A of

the Reserve Index are to be brought up to date annually, and

they are to be considered for Security Index status or retention

in the Reserve Index.

As a minimum, the previously mentioned

Investigative steps will be taken,

including the submission of

reports in the event additional subversive data is developed.

Changes in residence and/or employment should be submitted to

the Bureau on forms to be furnished the field in the immediate

future.

The administrative handling of the reopening of these

cases should be similar to that in the case of annual reports

In Security Index cases.

Section A of the Reserve Index will be maintained in

the field and at the Seat of Government in the same manner as

our Security Index except that this Index will be maintained only

• alphabetically. A copy of the Index will be relocated away from

headquarters city in the same manner as the Security Index and

at the same location.. To avoid confusion with the Security Index,

however, distinctive

colored cards and forms used in connection

therewith will be utilized.

SECTION B

Section B, containing the names of the remaining

individuals included in the Reserve Index, will be maintained

in the field in the same manner in which the Communist Index

is now being maintained.

Upon the deletion of a subject's name from the Security

Index based upon the application of the Security Index criteria,

It will be necessary to consider whether his name should then be

placed in Section A of the Reserve Index. If his name should so

be included, submit an appropriate recommendation. If the facts

do not justify the inclusion of his name in Section A, the

canceled Security Index card should be filed in Section B in

accordance with current practice.

Standards for Inclusion of Names in the Reserve Index

The standards for inclusion of individual's names in

the Reserve Index were discussed at the Internal security -

Espionage Conference composed of representatives from certain

field offices and Bureau supervisors and officials held at the

Burean on June 9-10, 1960. The Conference recommended revision

of our present standards for the inclusion of individual's names-

In the Reserve Index to insure that it fully represents a list

of Individuals who should be considered for investigation and/or

The revised standards follow:

1.

Membership in a basic revolutionary organization sub-

sequent to January 1, 1049, together with some indication of

sympathy or association with such an organization or a subversive

front organization subsequent to the reported membership and

no reliable evidence of defection.

2. Investigation has failed to substantiate allegations

of membership in a revolutionary organization within the past

five years, coupled with some evidence or information indicating

activity, association or sympathy for the subversive cause within

the same period, and no reliable evidence of defection.

3. The individual, within the past five years, by his as-

sociations, writings, financial support or conduct in relation

to and support of

subversive organizations or the international

communist movement is in a position to influence others at the

time of a national emergency and no reliable evidence of defection.

with a subversive background is forming a tour group for foreign

travel or an organization which is considered subversive is

sponsoring such a tour, take the following action:

Advise appropriate offices under-the-caption of the -

tour name of the organization sponsoring the tour, of the identities

of the individuals participating in the tour. Also furnish the

Bureau a memoranaum suitable for dissemination to the State De-

partment, the Central Intelligence Agency and appropriate Legal

' Attaches, including therein all readily available information

pertaining to the tour, such as itinerary, pertinent dates, names

of individuals making up the tour with addresses, if available,

a thumbnail sketch of the organization or individual sponsoring

the tour.

In the event additional pertinent information relative

to the tour is received at a later date, it should also be submitted

to the Bureau in form suitable for dissemination.

:

Memoranda relating to the

tours will be disseminated by

the Bureau with

a statement that as individuals participating are

Identified recipients will be furnished with memoranda under

individual case caption where those individuals are found to have

subversive backgrourds.

Therefore, it will be incumbent upon the

field to immediately identify and

submit individual memoranda

prepared in accordance with provisions in Section 87D of the

Manual of Instructions concerning individuals traveling abroad,

with the one exception that the details of travel will be replaced

by a reference to the memorandum previously prepared under the.

caption of the organization sponsoring the tour.

The fact that

the individual who formed the tour group has a subversive back-

ground of that the organization which sponsored the tour is con-

sidered subversive does not constitute a basis for the preparation

of individual memoranda in the absence of subversive information

on the individual traveling.

In addition to the submission of individual memoranda

on all members of the tour group with subversive backgrounds, eacr

office should submit a letter to the Bureau, under the organization

caption, listing therein the names of those

individuals residing

within its territory who are traveling with the tour group and on

whom no subversive information was found.

(A). TRAINING - POLICE -- You have previously been instructed con-

cerning the necessity of operating our Police Training Program with

an economical use of manpower. Occasionally, Bureau finds it

de Mirable to direct a letter to a field office pointing out it

a peared a certain police instructor, generally one assigned to a

Fisident Agency near the locality cf

a particular school, should

'andle instruction in the school rather than the instructor

riginally scheäuled

to do so.

Bureau is well aware that some police instructors are

particularly well qualified to handle certain subjects because of

their background, training, or experience.

Also, Bureau is aware

of the desirability of planned rotation of instructors in our police

schools so as to achieve a degree of freshness and at the same time

broaden the instructor's experience.

In instances wherein you wish

to use a certain instructor in a particular police school, even

though another apparently qualified instructor is assigned nearer

ine locality of the school, you should set forth

the specific reasons

why you are assigning that instructor to handle the instruction, and

Indicate he will be used unless advised to the contrary by Bureau.

Bureau will then consider the assignments on the basis of justifi-

cation set forth.

You should keep in mind the necessity of economical use

of manpower in police training; however, it is not desired that

economy be arbitrarily practiced to the sacrifice of the other

considerations mentioned herein.

(B): SUPPLIES - BUREAU PURCHASES - TRADING STAMPS -- As you are

aware, various business firms throughout the country offer trading

stamps which are redeemable for merchandise. The Comptroller

General.of the United States has ruled that such stamps are in the

nature of a discount, rebate, or reduction in the price paid, and

that it would be in the best

interests of the Government to redeem

stamps received for Government purchases. However, he has further

ruled that the disposition of such stamps is to be handled with

the least administrative burden.

Pursuant to decisions made by the Comptroller General of

the United States concerning trading stamps, the General Services

Administration (GSA), by Circular Number 190 revised, dated May 19,

In connection with trading stamps received for Government pur-

As a result of the instructions issued by the GSA, the

ureau desires that all trading stamps received by you and

the

employees of your office who have occasion to make-purchases-on-

behalf of the Bureau be collected, and on a monthly basis turned

over to the nearest Federal hospital or other similar Federal

institutions operated, managed, or supervised by any one of the

following:

(1) Veterans Administration, (2) Public Health

Service, and (3) Department of Defense. Of this group,

preference should be given to the institution which your office

uses for physical examinations.

Prior to the transfer of such trading stamps, you

should determine that the proposed recipient is prepared to

receive and utilize stamps.

The transfer of stamps is to be

made without reimbursement or accountability. However, you should

retain in your files minimum data for record

purposes,

to show

the disposition made of them by your office.

(B) HEALTH MATTER -- Employees with certain allergies and health

problems should be alerted that there are commercial firms which

manufacture bracelets and medallions in stainless steel and sterling

silver on which a particular nealth problem is inscribed.

Some of .

these health probiems pertain to diabetics allergic to penicillin,

individuals allergic to bee stings,

persons taking cortisone,

those allergic to tetanus antitoxin,

penicillin, or sulfa drugs,

epileptics, and free bleeders. Hospitals, health organizations

and: service clubs in a numher

cities throughout the nation are

distributing these bracelets and medallions to such indiviauals.

Experience has shown in a number of cases that data contained

thereon alerts a physician rendering emergency treatment which

has saved lives.

The Bureau is unable to purchase such items for

Its employees, and it is not practical to set up any formal program

for the distribution of cards containing health problems for

employees to carry on their person. However, the above information

should be disseminated

to your employees since

some with health

problems may desire to purchase such items privately or carry a

card which might alert a physician as to an individual

health

problem.

Employees interested should contact

their local medical

sources for specific data in respect to obtaining the desired

Item.

In light of the developments subsequent to the

U-2 Incident, the Conference was of the opinion that the time is

now ripe for

the Bureau to redirect our approach to apply more

pressure against the Soviet-bloc intelligence services in such

a way as to have a neutralizing or disruptive effect. As a result

of the recommendations of the Conference, the following action

has been approved.

are to be directed toward prosecution wherever

possible as a means of focusing public attention on

before implementing the above.)

4.

Physical surveillances When you learn that

soviet-bloc intelligence official plans to depart loi

his home country, you should intensify your physical

surveillances on

him until he departs and wherever

possible a defection approach should be made both as a

means of possible defection and as a disruptive

tactic. (Specific Bureau authority should be obtained

before making any approaches however.)

Soviet-bloc photography - In those instances where

Soviet-bloc officials are observed taking photographs

of military installations or national defense facilities,

you should give consideration to accosting

• them and

confiscating the photographs under the espionage

statute which prohibits pnotographs of certain

national defense installations.

(Such action, of

course, would be taken only with Bureau authority.

Speeches and public appearances - All offices.

. should be alert to public appearances and speeches

,made by Soviet-bloc officials in this country. The

Bureau should be advised in each instance.

It is necessary that each office obtain Bureau clearance

prior to initiating the above action.

You should, therefore, com-

municate with the Bureau by appropriate means depending upon

• the

urgency of the situation and in addition keep the Bureau advised

as to the results of any action taken.

Being, to lead

the so-called Negro race out of slavery in the wil-.

derness of North America by establishing an independent black

nation in the United States.

Members following Muhammad's teachings and his interpre-

tation of the "Koran"

believe there is no such thing as a Negro;

that the so-called

Negroes are slaves of the white race, referred

to as

"white devils,

in the United States, and that the white race;

because of its exploitation of the so-called Negroes, must and will

be destroyed in the approaching "War of Armageddon.

In the past,

officials and members of the NOI, Including

Muhammad, have refused to register under the provisions of the

Selective Service Acts and have declared that members

owe no

allegiance to the United States.

On May 5, 1958, the first source related that Muhammad,

upon advice of legal counsel, had tempered his personal statements.

and instructions to his ministers concerning the principles of his

organization in order to avoid possible prosecution by the United

States Government. However, he did not indicate any fundamental

changes in the teachings of his organization.

On May 16, 1960, another source reported that Muhammad,

early in July, 1958,

had decided to de-emphasize the religious

aspects of the teachings of Islam and to stress the economic

benefits to be derived by those Negroes who joined the NOI.

This

policy change, according to Muhammad, would help him to acquire

additional followers and create more interest in his programs.

members of the NOI. The purpose of the FOI is to protect officials

and property of the NOI, assure compliance of members with NOI

teachings and to prepare for the "War of Armageddon."

Members of

the FOI are required to participate in military drill and are

afforded the opportunity to engage in judo training. The FOI is

governed by a military system wherein the members are controlled

(G) USE OF CONFIDENCERS ON TELEPHONES IN NOISY LOCATIONS -- The

• Bell Telephone Companies are now offering a special type of micro-

phone for use in telephone instruments in noisy locations. This

unit, known as a Confidencer; is a noise-cancelling microphone

manufactured by the Roanwell Corporation, 180 Varick Street,

New York 14, New York. It is designed as a direct replacement

for the standard Fl or Tl

•mouthpiece microphones used in Bell

System and Western Electric instruments.

There are two models,

the R-CO for the 200, 300 and 400 series telephones

and the C-500

for the 500 type set.

The Confidencer serves to cancel out much of the outside

or background noise normally picked up by the regular microphone.

At the same time, the voice spoken directly into it is transmitted

with clarity and proper volume.

Sound originating at an angle

to the unit is reduced considerably in volume, so the mouthpiece

must be held directly in front of the user's lips and

not off to

one side or down on the chin.

The Confidencer may be used to

advantage where background noise interferes with the intelligi-

bility of conversation or where it is undesirable that any back-

ground conversation be overheardby. an outside party. This may

occur at locations such as reception desks, Number Three Register

desks and

radio dispatching rooms.

You are authorized to use Confidencers at those locations

where their features will serve a definite purpose.

They are not

to be installed on an indiscriminate basis due to the extra expense

Involved. The local Bell System company will supply Confidencers

for instruments serviced by them. Usually, there is no service

(installation) charge, but there

will be a continuing monthly

charge of

approximately 75 cents for each unit. For privately -

owned Western Electric type handsets, such as those used on radio

transmitters, the Confidencer may be purchased from the local

distributor of Roanwell products at $12 each.

If unavailable

locally, the units may be ordered through the Bureau.

¿ ureau endeavor to apply more prēssure against the soviet-bloo

ntelligence services in an effort to neutralize or disrupt their

activities.

In this connection, it was suggested that action be

taken to focus attention on and

curtail the repeated traffic

violations of Soviet-bloc personnel. It was noted that Soviet-

oloc oriicials are notoriously speedy drivers and have indicated

utter disregard for traffic laws.

In the future, when you observe Soviet-bloc officials

violating traffic laws, you are authorized to call such violations

to the attention of the local police authorities who have the

responsibility of enforcing traffic laws. These authorities may

desire to write to the State Department concerning such violations

thus providing the State. Department

with ammunition in considering

the harassing tactics employed against our attaches ana officials

who travel in Soviet-bloc countries:

believed that the above-suggested action if handled

judiciously can

result in partial disruption of Soviet intelligence

activities and in the reduction of hazards involved in surveillance

as well as the danger to lives of

American citizens. You should

advise the Bureau in each instance where you contact local

authorities in this matter and furnish the Bureau the results

thereof so that information regarding this matter can be correlated.

You should specifically inform the Bureau whether the violations

have been noted in the police records which are available to the

press.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director
