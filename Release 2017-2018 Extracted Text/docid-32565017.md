in the commercial records at 38 George St., Pittston, Pa.

It travels eight miles and

appears at the Wilkes-Barre

Resident Agency; however, the commercial record shows

40 N. Washington St., Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

There are

two

lines running into the Resident Agency; one is for the

"imput" of the signal into a

"cheese box" and the

line is used for the

"output"

from a

"cheese box. " other

FroM

this appearance the line travels 116 miles.

There is only

a two dob. loss in this 116z mile run.

(vides excellent quality.

The

net result pro-

Broken down by miles and costwise this service

is as follows:

Total installation charges

This includes 8 mile line from

Pittston to Wilkes-Barre

$358.00

$24.00

Pittston local wiring

Wilkes-Barre local line

Monthly charges will be $340.00 per month.

For added information, it is to be noted that a

Post Office Box has been obtained in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

The telephone billing for the

Weather Radio Inc. will be

mailed to this Post Office Box.

The net result of the

above arrangement is that the

FBI's interest in this

leased line and the commercial records of the Telephone

Company do not appear in any fashion.
