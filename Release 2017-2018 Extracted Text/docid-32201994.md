With reference to the Director

day, called Brigadier General Edward G. Lanscale at the

Pentagon and at his request made arrangements for him to come to my

office at 9:30 A. Mi. on November 9 for the purpose of furnishing him

any information that might be helpiul in his current assignment on Cuia.

In addition io myself, I have arranged for Inspector James Haverty,

Section Chief Sterling Donahoe, and Supervisors Richard Cotter and

Vincent Nasca to be present, if the Director approves.

When I talked to General Lansdale he said he was going to Fort

Meade this afternoon, which is the headquarters of the National Security

Agency. We also learned informally he would be seeing Richard Goodwin

of the White House this afternoon. General Lansiale said that he knew

this Cuban situation was in our backyard and that the FBI would know better

than he does what the situation was, particularly as to information pertaining

to anti-Castro groups in this country. He said he would like to go over this

situation with us and ask questions which might assist him.

We propose to approach this as follows:

(1) We will point out that we do not, of course, have intelligence

coverage within Cuba since our Legal Attaches were kicked out by Castro.

We have developed sources within Cuban refugee groups who furnish us

information on Cuba and on the activities of anti-Castro groups here in the

United States. We have disseminated voluminous information to the military

agencies along this line.

(2) As of possible assistance, we will give him copies of ow

Current Intelligence Analysis dated October 18, 1961 and November 8, 1961

(copies attached), which respectively show the thoroughly disorganized

state and factionalism of Cuban activities in the United States and the

present economic situation in Cuba.

(3) We will also give him copies of the 20-page Miami report

dated August 10, 1961, and a 20-page letterhead memorandum dated

October 4, 1961, both of which give an excellent rundown on anti-Castro

organizations in the United States and their present status.

(4) If you agree, we will furnish him a copy of our April 28,

1961, memorandum (copy attached) which we forwarded to the Attorney

General on April 28, 1961. This memorandum shows the FBi coverage

of Castro activities in the United States, including the July 26 Movement

the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Cuban ofticials and establishments,

Cuban intelligence activities, coordination with other United States agencies,

and Cuban refugees. We prepared this for the Attorney General's assistance

in connection with two National Security Action Memoranda referred to us

by the Attorney General.

(5) On April 28, 1961, we sent a letter to the Attorney General

entitled "The Cuban Situation" in which we outlined five possible measures

short of invasion that could bring about the collapse of the Castro regime;

namely, a total embargo; diplomatic isolation of Cuba; streaten

Suha increased propaganda broadcasts to Cuba; use of

responsible anti-Castro refugees to propagandize the masses of people in

Latin America. A copy of this memorandum is attached. If you agree,

we will abstract these five points from the memorandum to the Attorney

General and furnish them to General Lansdale for his assistance.

(6) We will advise General Lansdale we are prepared to discuss

any aspects of our activities which may be helpful to him. Mr. Haverty

will be available to comment on conditions in Cuba up to the time he left.

Messrs. Nasca and Cotter are in a position to discuss in detail intelligence

Mr. Donahoe and I will handle policy and control the meeting.

In the event the Director desires that this meeting be held in his

office or to otherwise attend or meet General Lanscale, we will be guidegle -

accordingly.
