MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT

: Anne Goodpasture's Appearance Before HSCA

I met with Anne Goodpasture and others this morning.

She spent all day yesterday, without lunch, testifying before

Congressman Dodd (and others from time to time), of the HSCA.

she does not want to write anything about it, having questions

about the Agency's ability and willingness to handle such :

paper appropriately; based on her experience, detailed below,

I agree with both her decision and her reasons.

2. She was called for the stated purpose of "an interview."

In fact, she was interviewed Wednesday afternoon by Michael

Goldsmith who went over in very general terms some of the subject

matter he intended to cover.

When it became apparent she was to

testify before the Committee, she raised the question of mis-

representation as to why she was here, accusing them of "bad

faith."

She learned in the course of her exchanges that the

rules of the Committee specify that a witness should have a

week in which to prepare; a rule that the Committee seemed to

be under no compulsion to observe.

3. By way of preliminary summary, it seems that she was

subjected to what we might call hostile interrogation. It is her

opinion that the questioning was designed for what she describes

as "entrapment."

She feels the thrust of the questioning did not

have so much to do with the facts relating to Oswald, per se, but

how the station was organized and functioned. On this point she

was informed that one of the purposes of the Committee is the

evaluation of the individual employees and the Agency as a whole,

which seems to have been the main thrust of the questioning.

To her surprise there appeared to be a number of un-

sanitized, raw documents in the possession of each of those present,

having been reproduced in multiple copies. She recalls the follow-

ing having copies:

one for each Congressman, one for the clerk,

one for the counsel (Goldsmith), a copy for her and apparently

some others.

She observes that Mr. Blakey was not present but

Representatives Sawyer and Preyer were there for some of what

happened.

Representative Dodd conducted much of the questioning.

She stated that there was an unsanitized rough draft

paper that she had typed out early in her work for us a year

We had asked to have a general description of how Mexico

Station functioned to help our overall understanding, and she

had written this in a sort of free form way. She says that

this eight page draft was clearly rough, it had to contain

errors (which she says is borne out by the research that she

did later). Also reproduced in full and unsanitized fashion

for each of those present was Tab P of the 1977 report of the

Special Task Force; this is a subject of a memorandum written

by me on 11 April 1978, a copy of which is attached.

6. Attempts were made to take specific items of information

out of context and build for them a significance they did not have,

and to force her to make unqualified statements concerning them.

When she declined to give specific testimony on various specific

points on what happened in 1963, her interrogators challenged

her both directly and by innuendo; as an example, they wanted to

know the exact date on which, in Mexico City, she wrote a comment

on an undated Washington Post newspaper story. They tried to

impute to her supervisory responsibilities over a number of officers

in the Mexico Station at the time; she had none and they tried to

argue with her flat statement of fact.

They tried to get her to

testify as to the competence and "conscientious" work of the COS,

using papers they questioned

as a basis for attacking his ability.

They were incapable or unwilling to understand or accept the fact

that a station worked in a reasonable fashion that was contrary

to some undisclosed pattern that they seemed to have formulated

for themselves.

7. She is certain that rom Keenon, Bob Shaw anc

will be called to testify.

She expressed a desire to talk with them

and I urged her not to do so; although a reasonable thing to do

under ordinary circumstances, in the face of a hostile inquiry of

dubious purpose, such a contact would be twisted and presented as

a form of collusion, and I felt that her discussion with them under

these circumstances should not take place.

However, I do believe

the Office of General Counsel should be instructed to advise wit-

nesses how to conduct themselves under such circumstances in terms

of their legal rights; there apparently were a number of tense

moments during her testimony requiring her to resist being cowed

by the bullying tactics of counsel and Mr. Dodd. At the end of

the day Mr. Dodd, on reflection, apologized to her for his question-

able conduct.

8. It seems to me that there is a requirement for a formal

review, outside the Office of the Legislative Counsel, as to how

this Agency, itself, is abiding by the established ground rules

for what it delivers to MSCA. In view of the multiple copies

made of material containing still-sensitive sources and methods.

chere is need for formal representation to Mr. Blakey at a level

higher than the Office of Legislative Counsel on future relations

with this Agency and the Committee. Whatever the action, steps

should be taken to retrieve all information that has been passed

improperly out of this Agency.
