Rekomelet dated 8/3/64.

Central

Bureau, Criminal Division;

On 8/11/64 Doctor Talian National Police, Rome,

Italy,

advised that the stops against the subject continue

in full force. t4(4)

Concerning the confusion which arose over the

identity of the individual who attempted to enter

7/31/64 by means of a falsified passport, Doctor

ItaTv on

advised as follows:

?

The Italian police had exchanged comsunications

with Canadian authorities concerning one. ANGELO/ERUNA, an

Italian citizen who was being expelled from Canada Tor

narcotics activity.

The Canadian authorities advised the

Italian police of the date and flight on which BRUNA would

arrive in Italy. This information was furnished by the'

Central Bureau, Criminal Division,

to the airport police in

Milan, Italy.

Airport police in Milan, however, mistakenly

filed this information in the subject's file and so, when

BRUNA arrived as scheduled and tried to use the falsified

passport of ANTONIO SPOSITO

the, airport police reached

the erroneout conclusion that BRUNA was the subject.

Doctor

stated that, as noted above,

BRUNA is an Italian citizen and so far as is known has

had no connections with the United States. f4(u.)

Rome is continuing to maintain close contact with

its sources

concerning the projected travel of the subject

to Italy. X cha
