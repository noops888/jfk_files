Cigarette Service, Incorporated, and Ajax Phonograph Company,

JFK Law 10(a)2

VOGEL 18 also Secretary-

Treasurer of the Aper Amusement Company, also at 4246 North

Lincoln Avenue, Chicago, but checks of that concern were

not available for review and it is not known whether ALEX

is on the payroll of that company:

It is noted

that vOGEL previously had been reported

as possibly being ALEX's closest hoodlum associate. His

three enterprises

at 4246 North Lincoln are used to carry

on his business as the chief ofslot machine and other coin

operated machine operations for the Chicago crime syndicate

in Cook County,

Illinois, and three or four other northern

Illinois counties.

Attention is drawn to the fact that ALEX has never

been known to be employed in any capacity for De Luxe, Ajax,

or Apex.

As a matter of interest,

on January 17, 1959, ALEX

was overheard by SA ROEMER conversing with an unknown man

in the Randolph Towers Barber Shop,

188 West Randolph,

On this occasion,

he carried on a vituperous tirade

and such

other well known Chicago area

hoodlums as MARCUS "STUDDY "

LOONEY, JACK "THREE FINGER" WHITE, and GEORGE "RED" PARKER.

CG T-2 was unable to advise as to

the disposition of this

arrest. SAM ALEX is a brother of GUS ALEX.

II. ASSOCIATES

THEODORE BRISKIN

CG T-l stated that among the close friends of GUS

and MARIANNE ALEX iS THEODORE "TEDY BRISKIN, the formei

husband of BETTY HUTTON, prominent movie actress, and the

President of the Revere

Camera Company, with offices in

Chicago and California.

, CG T-1 stated that as a matter of

fact, the ALEXs were able to secure a good position for

ILY.

JAMES "MICKEY" RYAN,

a brother of MARIANNE RYAN,

with the

Revere Camera Company in California through their friendship

with BRISKIN,

It is noted that previous information concerning

the relationwhip of ALEX with BRISKIN has been reported.

CG T-3, who has furnished reliable information in

advised that within the past several months,

contacted PAT MARCI, the secretary of Alderman

I JOHN D' ARCO

of the Ist ward of

Chicago, in an effort to put a "26" gameILL

in his place of business.

"He advised that MARCI told him

to call the Maxwell Street Police District and ask for

"SMOKEY", & plainclothes detective working with that

district.

Informant advised that MARCI had given him the

go ahead for the game and said that it would be undisturbed

by the Chicago Police Department as

long as he made his

contact with SMOKEY.

Informant advised that he contacted

SMOKEY and that arrangements were

made whereby the informant

NH 45679 DooId: 32289271 Page 7

## Page 8

CG 92-373

paid $50 a month directly to SMOKEY, with further arrangements

that when his business built, up in several months,

there would

be a new figure for the police department protection.

In

connection with D'ARCO, the informant advised that when he

came to Chicago in 1952 and

opened a grocery store in the

vicinity of Taylor and Halsted Streets, he noted that numerous

push carts were selling vegetables without proper license

and were parked right in front of his vegetable store, under-

selling him and creating a general nuisance.

Informant

advised that according to city ordinance,

these push carts

were not allowed to conduct business without a license.

He

advised he, therefore, contacted the Chicago Police Department,

Maxwell District, in an effort to have the push carts removed.

He advised that they referred him to Alderman D'ARCO, who sent

his secretary, PAT MARCI, to the store. MARCI advised that

he would have

two of the

push carts taken away, advising that

the others would have to stay.

He told the informant that

this would cost him $50 per week to have the two push carts

removed.

Informant advised that he would have to place

some friend of PAT MARCI on his payroll, although he would

never work and the $50 would simply go into D'ARCO's pocket.

Informant advised that he refused this arrangement and he and

MARCI bargained and eventually wound up with the informant

contributing $600 per year to D'ARCO. He advised that he

paid

the $600 in a very unique way and has been paying t

ever since 1952.

February, he is sent 1,200 tickets to the Democratic

Organizations Picnic to be held sometime in the summer. These:

tickets are marked 50c apiece, and the $600 is simply the

informant's donation to the Democratic organization in his

ward.

The money eventually falls into D'ARCO's hands.

"He

advised that recently, dur to his increased dealings with

MARCI, he has been advised that his contribution in the future

will

probably run in excess of $1,000.

The Swiss Central Police Bureau advised by letter

dated March 5, 1959, that GUS ALEX appeared at the Hotel

Baur-au-Lac, Zurich, Switzerland, on December 22, 1958, with

a woman alleged to be his wife and left the following day

for st.

Moritz, where they remained at the Palace Hotel until

January 5, 1959. During their stay there,

they made no special

contacts.

They returned to Zurich,

where

they again stayed at

the Hotel Baur-au-Lac on January 5, 1959, and left on January 6,

1959, by air for Vienna, Austria. The Swiss Police furnished

copies of the two hotel

registrations at the Hotel Baur-au-Lac,

and it was noted that GUS ALEX indicated that his profession

was "salesman".

The following information regarding the subject's

activities in Vienna, Austria,

was furnished under date of

February 5, 1959, by MI. dOSEF HOLAUBEK,

Police President,

Vienna, and received on February 9, 1959:

GUS ALEX,

born January 4, 1914, in Chicago, American

citizen, and his wife, MARIANNE RYAN ALIX, arrived in Vienna,

Austria, on January 6, 1959, and registered in the Hotel

Imperial

at 16 Kaerntnerring, Vienna I, Austria.

ALEX was

carrying

good until

July 12, 1959.

Upon arrival at the hotel, he listed his

permanent address as 9353 South Spaulding

Avenue, Evergreen

Park, Illinois, USA.

His double room at the hotel had been

reserved by the Drake Travel Service through the "Cosmos"

Travel Service in Vienna.

Personnel at the Hotel Imperial were shown photo-

graphs of GUS and MARIANNE ALEX and were able to readily

identify these photographs. They, however, could not furnish

any information indicating any unusual activities on the part

of either GUS Or MARIANNE ALEX while they remained at the

hotel. The couple appeared to engage in the usual sight-

seeing and shopping activities in Vienna and there was no

information that they had received any guests at the hotel.

Both on January 8. and January 9, 1959, GUS ALEX placed

telephone calls to the Hotel "Baurf in Zurich, Switzerland.

GUS and MARIANNE ALEX departed Vienna on January 9,

1959, for an undisclosed destination.

GEORGES CLOT of the Prefecture of Police,

Paris,

France, advised on February 25, 1959, that ALEX and his

wife registered at the Hotel Ritz, 15 Place Vendome, Paris;

on January 9, 1959, and departed on January 15, 1959. They

occupied Room 110

and used their American passports for

identification at the time of registration. ' CLOT advised

that

ALEX was not engaged in any unusual activities while

in Paris, and so far as could be determined, did not make

any contacts with Paris underworld figures.

GUS ALEX

and his wife arrived at New York Inter-

national Airport at 9:45 PM on January 15, 1959, aboard

Pan American Flight Number 115.

Based on prior arrange

ments with United States Customs, GUS and MARIANNE ALEX

were taken to an interview room and subjected to a seärch

of their baggage and personal effects by United States

Customs Staff Officer JOSEPH ROONEY and Inspector JOHN

HARRINGTON.

Written material found in their possession was

made available to Special Agents by Customs Inspectors and

it was either photographed or copied by/ hand. The majority

of the written material was found in the possession of

MARIANNE ALEX, and it consisted of notes concerning her

trip, address and telephone book and an itemized list of

purchases made:

Due to an inconsistency between their declaration

and evidence of other purchases, GUS and MARIANNE ALFX were

strip searched by Customs inspectors and matrons:

The

ALEXs stated in their declaration that they had purchased

items totaling $950, whereas material in their personal

the criminal activities

position since early December, 1958,

to furnish any informa-

tion concerning ALEX or other

syndicate leaders in Chicago,

due to the fact that he spends the winter months in Miami,

Florida. However,

this informant returned to Chicago on

April 8, 1959, and it is expected that he will soon be in

a position to furnish current information concerning ALEX

and other hoodlums.

The following informants have furnished recent

information concerning ALEX,

but have not furnished any

during the period covered by instant report:

Concerning the address book found in the possession

of MARIANNE RYAN ALEX when she was searched by the United

States Customs Service at International Airport on January 15,

1959, information appearing therein was thoroughly reviewed

by the Agent assigned this case to determine investigative

leads and for purposes of reporting. It was determined that

with very few exceptions, the names

and addresses contained

in this address book were female friends of MARIANNE, most

of whom are engaged in the modeling business in Chicago, and

who were not considered to be associates of the subject.

Most of these acquaintances of MARIANNE were previously known

to this office, although seven or eight were not.

Perusal of the address book did reflect that apparently,

MARIANNE has been instructed by the subject that he can be

contacted during the day at Celano's, Fishs, or Fritzel's,

his known hangouts, and the phone numbers for these establish-

ments which are listed in MARIANNE's address book are apparently

phones in these establishments where the person who answers

would be expected to know ALEX or possibly his whereabouts in

the event he is not present.

It is noted that this office has established fixed

surveillance plants at Celand's and at Fish's, and that

surveillances of these establishments are conducted from

time to time.

Investigation is being requested by leads

to this report of offices in the continental United States

and by separate letter to Bureau, of Bureau personnel in

Istanbul and Paris.

The attention of the Newark Office is directed

to the following information concerning identification of

contact made by CG 6232-C of top hoodlums and their lieutenants

in the Newark area during November, 1958.

This informant was

contacted recarding Newark letter to Chicago dated January 9,

1959, and as a result of

that contact, supplied the following

information

after having been shown appropriate photographs

as contained in the Newark letter!

He advised

the PETE LA BLANC whom he has been

referring to is identical with the photograph of PETER

DOMINIC LA PLACA of Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.

He

advised, however, that the photograph

LA BLANC now is almost completely bald and has grey hair

at the temples.

He identified the photo of ARMAND ALFRED DEVITO as

the ALFRED DEVITO which he had referred to as a contact of

his in New Jersey

and & salesman for & Chevrolet company in

New Jersey.

The informant advised that the photograph of

that he was incorrect in saying that it was

"RICHIE

THE BOOT" whom he had attempted to contact,

whereas it was

actually "RICHIE THE BOOT'g" SON, ANTHONY, whom he knows by

the nickname if "TONY BOY".

The informant advised that CHARLES TOURINE is

identical to an individual known to hin ás "CHARLIE THE

BLADE". He advised that when he was last in New Jersey,

he understood from numerous contacts that "Uncle Sam was

presently looking for CHARLES TOURINE because TOURINE was

representing the syndicate gambling interests of one LONGIE

ABE ZWILLMAN. He advised that "CHARLAL THE BLADE" presently

represents ZWILLMAN and several other individuals from the

East who are receiving a piece of the huge crap games in

Cuba. He advised that TOURINE was personally taking care of

ZWILLMAN's interest in this activity.

He advised that

TOURINE had received prominence in the 1940s Shen he was

then engaged in bootlegging activities in the New Jersey

area.

He advised that TOURINE then became acquainted with

ZWILLMAN and ZWILLMAN sponsored his activities in the

gambling situation in the New Jersey area.

He advised that

He advised that shortly thereafter, it was

he has always been controlled to a large extent by LONGIE

ZWILLMAN and actually represents many of his interests.

The informant advised that the purpose of his

Jersey several months ago to straighten out his difficulties

in Chicago was for the purpose of contacting the "Blade",

who would have straightened the situation out in a hurry

for him. Informant advised, however, that he was told when

he got to Newark that the "Blade" was then in Cuba

He

advised that had the "Blade" been in Newark at that time,

he and DEVITO would have seen him to settle the dispute

which the informant found himself in, rather than make all

of the other contacts which he was forced to make.

The informant advised with reference to LOUIS

"COCA COLA" that the place where he met "COCA COLA" is as

described on page 6 of referenced Newark letter, which is

the Park-Stone Social

and Political Club.

Informant advised

that he did not associate the name of LOUIS DE BENEDETTO

never known LOUIS "COCA COLA' by any other name than his

Informant also advised the photograph of ANTONIO

ROÇCO CAPONIGRO is known to him as TONY BANANAS.

He advised,

however, that the photograph is an extremely poor one.

The informant also advised that the background

information regarding NICK CARELLA is identical with the

individual known to him as NICK CARELLA, who he had mentioned

previously as an attorney who made arrangements for him to

see several hoodlums in the New Jersey area.

The informant

advised that the Canteen Bar and Grill, Ridge Road, Lindhurst,

New Jersey, was the restaurant in which he had an interest

many years

ago.

He advised also that the identification record

regarding SALVATORE ESPOSITO, 11-43 Hoehn street, Lodi,

Apartment 3, age 50, is probably identical with

the SALVATORE

ESPOSITO he was referring to.

He advised that it was his

recollection that SALVATORE ESPOSITO was wanted by the New

York City Police Department some time around 1957, as

ESPOSITO

told him that the place where he was conducting

bookmaking activities took & pinch about that time.

Informant

advised that ESPOSITO jumped out of the building and got

from the New York Police Department.

He advised that

it was possibly in connection with this that ESPOSITO was

wanted as a fugitive from justice and the case was referred

to the Bergen County prosecutor:
