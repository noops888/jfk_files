BACKGROUND

Operation ALTRUNK III/IV which was mounted in Auguat 1963 was

successful in that the two principals of the team, AMICE-27

and AMICE-14,

were ablo to contact and to recrult two princi

pal agents and several other action agents to lay the ground

work fo. the KHAPRON objectives of the AUTRUNK operation.

One

of the two internal P/A's, ANTRUNK-9, vas oxfiltrated with the

four-man ALTRUNK infiltration team for training and cperat10aad

discussions in the JWAVE area.

In early September, ANTRUNg

was re-infiltrated into PBRUMEN In Operation ANTRUNK V, the

same operation which exfiltrated AMFAUNAS -1, -3,

-13 and -34.

In late October AMICE 27 was separated fron the clandestine

part of the AlTRUNk operation.

The original objectives of

Operation ASTRUNK VI,

postponed fron December 1963 to January

1964, were to revitalize and re-direct the efforts of the two

Internal P/A's toward their primary task, 1.e. to spot and re

cruit among high level figures who are dissatisfied with the

Castro regine. In late December, the scope of this mission was

altered by the receipt of a commercial telegram in open code

Iron ANTRUNK-9 Indicating that he was in grave danger and wished

to be exfiltrated.

The twin objectives of Operation ANTRUNK VI

then becane:

first, to exfiltrate AKTRUN-9 and, this accom

plished,

for AMICE-14 to proceed to Havana for his task of re

channelling AXTRUNK-10's responsibilities.

The exfiltration of

ANTRUNK-9, who brought with him his entire family consisting of

wife,

brother-in law,

and three small children, was accomplished

on 9

January 1964.

The unexpected presence of

ANTRUNK- 9 ' g

family, coupler with reports of increased vigilance in the 1nf1l-

tration area, forced AHICE-14 to exfiltrate the same night with

out attempting to accomplish the second part of his miesion.
