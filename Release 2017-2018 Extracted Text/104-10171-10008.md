Information attached to this report fell into

• the hands of JMWAVE through two distinct channels.

prior to 7 July 1962 AMCOG-2 through a cut-out had delivered

to AMBLEAK? some material.

ANCOG-2 does not know AVBLEAK-2.

ANBLEAK-2 brought it out to AMBLEAK-1 who on ? July 1962

turned the "pouch" over to ILAWLOTT, AMBLEAK-1'S C/O.

intercepted this "pouch" and xeroxed the cover pages of the

reports which were gonerated by ALIMPEX; the material was

and sent on its waj.

i BESEe Imported he he use organisation.

15 assumed that the ANSP ELL roceived the material in

and they in turn delivered the matertal to NOEMAIR(P)

the ASPELL C/O, on or about 19 July.

This is the background to a story which now gains new

importance.

The information which was copled by HAWLOTT 1g

not reflected in toto in the materiel eventually received

by NOEMAYR, thus the xerored coples of some of the documents,

original copies for which were not received from the AJSPELL

organization.

REPORT COVER SHEET (continued)

Operational security precludes a confrontation of the ANSPELL

organization,

therefore Headquarters will have to be satisfied

with copies of the original documents for some of the import/

export items, and with xeroxed copies of merely the cover sheets

for some of the other Items is

This whole sad story has had one positive reaction.
