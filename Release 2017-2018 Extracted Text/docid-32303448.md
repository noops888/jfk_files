For the Bureau's additional information, or

Sicily; Italy, advised that Calogero Sinatra appeared at

the Consulate Generala June 4 to request revalidation of

his non-immigrant B-2 visa which was issued at Palermo on

April 17, 1902,

and used for one entry into the United States

on June 16, 1962.

According to the ACG, the visa file which

was initiated when Sinatra made his original application was

forwarded to the American Embassy in Rome in August, 1962, and

had not been returned to the ACG.

The ACG stated Sinatra

indicated he wished to depart from Italy on June 10, 1963,

but was informed by the ACG that it would be impossible to

make a decision on his request by that date.
