Assassination of President KENNEDY

He stated at the outset that he wished to express

his deep sympathy over the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that he was very disturbed by the news of the assassination

and he found most Soviet nationals that he had come in contact

with to have also been concerned over the death of President

KENNEDY. He felt that President KENNEDY was sincerely admired

by most of the soviet nationals and that the usual cynical

attitude toward such an event was not present in this instance.

The Informant advised that he had visited the soviet (5)

Mission several times during the days immediately following

President KENNEDY's assassination.

could only seriously harm American-Soviet relations.

It was

believed at the Soviet Mission]that the Dallas Police Department (S

was covering up for someone eIse by arresting OSWALD, and

that this cover-up was an attempt to protect a "right wing

group"

The informant related that by Monday or Tuesday

following the assassination, the belief had developedlat the S

Soviet Mission that the assassination was a plot or conspiracy

aimed at a take-over in American politics by some group rather

than an individual act of revenge. officials at the Soviet CS3

Mission did not believe OSWALD was involved but had been

intentionally arrested by the real conspirators due to his

leftist background.

He indicated these conspirators knew all

about OSWALD, including his employment and possession of a

rifle.

The informant further related that as of the weekend

of 12/1/63, a belief had developed lat the Soviet Mission that [SJ

OSWALD had been Involved more directly in the assassination

and that he was part of a right wing movement.

This belief

was enhanced by certain revelations that OSWALD was anti-soviet,

had intended to publish an anti-soviet book and had been

voters in the rest of the country would subconsciously take

this into consideration; that he was in some way in the public

mind connected with the

The informant then digressed into an

explanation a soviet policy toward Cuba p.son

As an example, the informant related that

initially there were only four trained Cuban pilots who could

fly Soviet aircraft.

The informant stated that Soviet troops

in Cuba had never been

• intended to protect Cuba from outside

attack since the number of Soviet troops in Cuba would never

have been able to withstand a strong US military action against

He stated that Soviet rockets were introduced into Cuba

to establish a bargaining position with the US and to provide

moral support to CASTRO.

He remarked that many of these rockets

were so stationed that they could be clearly observed by us

reconnaissance.

He explained that the Soviet Union hoped to

obtain a Soviet-Cuban-US treaty of non-aggression against Cuba

in return for Soviet removal of these rockets.

the primary objective had always been in one way or another to

secure a US pledge of non-aggression against Cuba. When the

above treaty was not realized, the Soviet Union obtained a

promise from President KENNEDY through an exchange of letters

none talest

with Premier KHRUSHCHEV to the effect that the US would not

undertake an attack against Cuba; thus the Soviet Union gained

1ts objective,

namely, no Us attack or intervention in Cuba

Soviet officials still believe that the US is under obligation

not to attack cuba but that this commitment was mainly a

personal one and thus the Soviets feel strong concern over

what attitude President JOHNSON will adopt toward Cuba.
