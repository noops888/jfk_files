additional and new information about the meeting.. This

program was also to insure that information might be received

in advance of any similar future meeting.

The initial chart on the results of the interview

program is set out in the report of SA ARTHUR V. HART dated

5/21/59, at Albany, and additional interviews have been set

forth in chart form in supplementary reports.
