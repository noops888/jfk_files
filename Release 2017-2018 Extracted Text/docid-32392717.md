Mr. George de Monrenscinilet

Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter to you,

dated 5 September 1976

Action Required:

None.

This memorandum is for your information.

We have also

attached at A a suggested draft reply to Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter.

Action Taken:

2.. We have reviewed DO and IG files on Mr. de Mohrenschildt.

addition, at our request, the CI Staff has run Agency traces on him and

has been in touch with the FBI as well.

Findings

3. " There is voluminous material on Mr. de Mohrenschildt in CIA

files, most of it dating from the post-Kennedy assassination period

he testified before the Warren Commission on his acquaintance

with vir. and firs. Lee Harvey Oswald. (A copy of the de Mohrenschildts'

testimony is attached at B.)

The bulk of the material in our files consists of FBI reportss

the most recent of which is dated 1967.

The FBI has informed CIA that

it has no traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt beyond that date; our files

contain all of its previous material on him.

Mr. Helms' 3 June 1964 memorandum for the Warren Commission on

the de Mohrenschildts is attached at C.

It describes the Agency's

interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a

result

of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year.

Contaci Division (now

Domestic Coliection Division - DCD) had its resident

agent in Dallas,

Mir. J. Walton Moore, contact Mir. de Mohrenschiidt at that time.

The

history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Mohrenschildt

from 1957

to 1961 is also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested

traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt..

The trace results (attached at D) con-

tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive

contact with the de Monrenschildts.

(An OS summary on Mir. de Mohrenschildt

prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

6.

Our files show that a mail cover was placed on letters addressed

to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S.

Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to

(This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-

vestigations.)

This included opening and photographing the contents of

some letters by the CIA Station there. The results of this operation

were shared with the FBI.

Mr. re Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during

the Rockefeller Commission investigations.

We were asked to respond to a

memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA

Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation."

Mr. Hoch called for

an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and

asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de

Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission iS

The most recent information we have on. Mr.. de Mohrenschildt comes

from Mr. J. Walton Moore who was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers

connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell

Publishing Company:

Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and

Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mir. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached

Conciusions:

Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have Tead an adventurous and

colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman. He is both well

and poorly connected

and some of his associations in the past have

raised serious questions.

Certainly his relationship with the

Oswalds has caused

him considerable trouble and may have caused this

Agency and the FBI

to spend more time and energy on him in the past

than was necessary.

10.

Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their

interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late

1960's.

• We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could

either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-

tives

on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination

of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond

Mr. Moore's reporis attached at F.

What we can say is that we have

found no indication that

either CIA or the FBI has taken any active

interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.
