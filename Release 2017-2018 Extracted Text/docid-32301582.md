JOHNSON told FIORINI that he wanted to be seen with FIORINI

testify that he was not on the plane. JOHNSON said pilot

MM 105-2855

Miami has been in close contact daily with MM 928-PSI,

Cuban exiled pilot who furnished accurate details of attempted

12/28/63 raid by MIRR. During this period PSI has reported the

progress made by BOSCH in planning another raid.

It appears

that PSI still has the confidence of BOSCH, who plans to use him

again as pilot on the next raid.

PSI was in direct contact with BOSCH 1/24-25/64, and

received no indication whatsoever that BOSCH planned any air raid

for 1/25-26/64. BOSCH advised he does plan air raid for some

time between now and 2/23/64. He has indicated that raiding

plane will operate from a base in Dade County, Fla. area.

BOSCH told PSI that he is departing Miami 1/27 or 28/64,

for New York area in order collect funds for intended raid.

PSI has also reported that WILLIAM JOHNSON, U. S. citizen who

was involved in preparations for the 12/28/63 attempted raid,

is also involved in preparations for next raid and that CHARLES

BUSH, Broward International Airport charter plane dealer, is

scheduled to make available a plane for this raid.

PSI stated 1/27/64, that BOSCH has not yet settled

upon a firm plan, but PSI feels certain BOSCH is depending

on PSI for his services in executing plan.

Above pertinent facts have been furnished only to

U. S. Customs, Miami, at this point for reasons of protecting

MM 928-PSI. It appears that BOSCH and JOHNSON are attempting

to uncover any informant in this operation by giving out false

information prior to actual date of operation.

On 12/29/63, JOHNSON, upon being interviewed concerning

12/28/63 raid attempt, advised that he regarded FIORINI as an

informer for the Government. He also expressed suspicion of PSI,

but appeared to be on fishing expedition re the latter and no

other information has been receivd reflecting PSI is regarded

as an informer.

PSI has advised that BOSCH, not JOHNSON, has full

control over all MIRR operations; and PSI has seen no evidence

that BOSCH is interested in obtaining two P-51 aircraft.

Miami submitting report suitable for dissemination

dated 1/28/64, re this case which will reflect that BOSCH is

making plans for another air raid.

In order to protect MM 928-PSI, it is recommended

that Bureau not disseminate any information contained in this

communication, other than to state that no confirmation

received concerning report that MIRR planned raid for 1/25-26/64.
