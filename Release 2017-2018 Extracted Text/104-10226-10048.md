1. I mrote you in a previoua report about my offorts to unite

the different clandestine groupe in the neutern provinces

A similar effort will de made in the eastern

provinces. I belleve that the coming week I shall be able

to give you a detailed report about the work that has beon

done.

At this moment se are naking an inventory of the arma we

can cut on,

and than the time comes, I shall tell you

what war materiel we shall need and the places where It

can be recalved. I hope 1t may be pousible to recesve

ald (from. you), as the work which I liave been doing 18

conalderable and I have never aoked anything of you.

have done overything by myself.

But thia 1a a nation-"ide

thing which required funde ind certain comnitments..

3.

Don't think that the dare thing la going to happen that

happened to the 60,000 peBoa sent to the Unidad Revoluoionario

destination and were canaged by Hilario, Polin, and Boris.

Hilario took asylud in an embassy, and the other tho were

captured by au2.: I an passing all this information on to

you so you will non that I am forking here and know every-

thing that does go on.

I mention names so that youccan check

the

infornation.

It is certain that the last tro mentioned

above have. told the 0-2 about the codes.

They are st1ll

detained but they have comforts which other prisoners do not

got.

There 18 a staterent which they made which sayo that

over there (raning Manif) they were told that there were

three different persons

In Habana - AMRUNO-l, Rafaete and Dia 3

R-11 (does he

nean binself?) and that the last person mas

not "a man of confidenco"

but the firat two were the

tease i

appropriate ones (10s Indicados). AB DoOn as AMRUNG-I,

Rafael®

and SORI arrived here in Habana I was arare of the

fact and could have got in touch with them at any given tine.

I did not do so because

I did not need to see then.

On the

other hand they did not know me or know where to find me,

which 18 a aign that I was working better and had a better

intelligence service than they did.

I feel thoy did not have

confidence in me or perhaps thought loould not be of servloo

to then because of my little experience and youth.

They did

not five me any help and did not let me use any of the bar

material that was offered re.

I want to domonstrate to you

that I am capable of doing the sane kind of "ork, and I ant

you to racommend se t0..

those gentlemen, whom God

keep in sloryi
