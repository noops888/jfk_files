Gutierrez came around a corner of a wall and bumped into the Cuban who was

talking with the American, thereby seeing them both for a split second

face-to-face. He apologized, the Cuban graciously accepted the apology,

and all three men immediately continued walking in their respective directions.

When he overheard their conversation, however, which must have been resumed

almost instantaneously, Gutierrez turned around to get another look. - Thus,

he got a good look only of the backs of both men. Likewise, when he followed

them to their automobile, he saw them only from a distance and again only

their backs. The conclusion of the FBI representatives assigned to this

case is that Gutierrez probably did see money being passed to a man who

appeared to be an American, but that whether that man was Lee Harvey

Oswald is by no means certain.

From reviewing his work schedule, which he says he rigorously

adhered to, Gutierrez is able to fix the time at which he must have seen

the Cuban and the American as 10:50 a.M. on October 1, give or take a very

few minutes. From the CIA wire-tapping facilities in Mexico City we know

that at exactly 10:30 a.m. on October I Lee Harvey Oswald telephoned into

the Soviet Embassy and spoke very briefly with someone there. The con-

versation was short because he was not able to reach the person who was

handling his case (the Consul) and therefore was quickly asked to call back

on a different number. We do not know, nor do we have any way of finding

out, from where Oswald was telephoning. At 11:30 a.ll., exactly, he

telephoned the number which had been given to him at 10:30 a.m. - the

Russian Consulate - and had a slightly longer conversation about whether

the telegram sent to Washington had been answered. The Cuban and Russian

Consulates in Mexico City are located very close to one another, only
