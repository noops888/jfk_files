polite to FAINBERO and invitod him to come to his office at 1430 on 18 May.

When FAINBERG gained admittanco to the Consulate at the appointod hour (whioh

1dentifled Soviet about 25-30 yearg old who opened the door that KAZAKOV had bee

FAINBERG gave his card to the young Soviet and asked that KAZAKOV

telephone, but there was no' answer. KAZAKOV never called back.

The event took place an 22 May 1966. It in best described in the

off101al Invitation, a translation of which follows:

Paris 5).

The evening's program:

1. Commemorative part

4. A handsomely printed program brochure prominently listed the nembors

origin; most of khom me sotive In the arts. Among others, there was ERASLAVSKY

President of the

"Federal Union of Voluntary Units of Fereign Origin in the

Resistance Army" (whom we noted in 1965 to have been a controt of AEDIGIT-1),

WEBINA, and - much to FAINBERG's surprise - Lov ARONSON.

We had FAINBERG contact ARONSON to find out why he appeared on the

honorary committee and to attempt to elloit any Information regarding the nature

of this relationghip with KAZAKOV.

and they asked ARONSON to serve on the honerary committee.

ARONSON refused

beonuse he felt that the 22 May event seemed to have politioal overtones.

KAZAKOV acceptod his refusal, although he doniod any politioal propaganda

However, ARONSON did promise to collaborate with Andre BARSACO, a

membor of the committee, on an artiole about Russian art in the emigration, and

KAZAKOV was grateful for the offer.

ARENSON remarked that BARSACQ irote the

artiolo, ARONSON translated 1t, but 1t was not printed in the official progran

as planned.

o) Several days after KAZAKOV! & vinit to his restaurant, ARONSON

nocompanied his brother-In-law to the Soviet Consulate where the Intter wanted

to obtain an extension of his Soviot exit visa.

They were not reoeived by

KAZAKOV but by (Sergey Alekseyevich) LOKLEYEV (201-348434) who told them in

aubatance the following:

"We do not extend the visa for anyone.

ARONSON understood

this to be a not too subtlo allumion to his refusal to serve on the committee,

and then agreed to do as KAZAKOV had asked him to do. After that his brother-

ARONSON was very grateful and

The lattor then asked

ARONSON to keep him posted of visiting Russian artists who oome to his restaurant

ARONSON promised that he

would do everything that he could, even offering to introduce PAINBERG per-

4. Station Comment:

a) Our Interest In ARONSON is prodioated on the faot that tho

"Dominique" rostaurant is generally known to be frequented by visiting Soviet

artists - ARONSON himself has a theatrical background - and also because 10081

Soviets may frequent 1t.

For example Deputy Chief of the Commeroial Mission

Aleksey Anatolyevich MALYSHEV (201-254801) Indionted to Richard C.

BASESCU that

he knew the owner of the "Dominique" restaurant personally (OPPA-77690, 16

December 1964).

We are there fore planning to have FAINBERG make the attempt

to develop ARONSON as an unwitting source, keeping In mind, osbourse, that someone

may bo trying to put the shoe on the other foot.

of operational utility of FAINBERG when he uses his ABLEDIER cover funottens
