A surveillance is an investigative technique just as intertiews, collecting

course, practical experience in this particular activity is the best

Surveillances are expensive in that they cause the tying up of manpower and

should not be resorted

to unless results can reasonably be expected.

In surveillances in cases of major importance SACs should assume personal,

on-the-scene supervision and not delegate such command to subordinates.

If a sufficient reason exists to prevent the SAC from being personally

D. TYPES OF SURVEILLANCES

1.

Fixed surveillances

These are surveillances often referred to as plants, where the Agents

are stationed'in one location and usually involve the surveillance of

a place to determine the activities and

the identity of persons going

in and oui of the premises under surveillance.

2.

Mobile surveillances

This is a moving surveillance where the Agents are moving about on foot,

by automobile or on trains, airplanes, or other means of

transportation,

surveilling subjects or suspects in Bureau cases.

These types

surveillances may be broken down into the following categories:

2..

Close surveillances

Where it is necessary to keep the subjects

or suspects under

surveillance at all times

and where it may involve

considerable

activity to locate the

subjects or suspects again if they are

lost.

-=

b.

Loose surveillances

All surveillanes which may be conducted as spot checks to

determine the contacts and activities

of the subjects

or

suspects and where it may be proper to drop the surveillance

temporarily rather than risk the chance of being "made."

This

type of

surveillance is sometimes desirable in very discreet

investigations involving subjects

whose habits and contacts

are so well known that they can be readily located again if

it becomes desirable to drop the surveillance temporarily.

SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT

The equipment used on surveillances will depend upon the type and purpose of.

the surveillance.

examples illustrate some of the uses of

technical and other equipment on Bureau surveillances.

Firearms, restraining devices, and lighting equipment on fugitive

surveillances

Surveillances in extortion cases often require a great variety of equip-

including radio,

lighting equipment,

decoy packages,

signaling devices, binoculars,

as well as firearms and restraining devices.

Automobiles are essential in practically all types of surveillances and

should be taken to insure that the cars used are not conspicuous

and are speedy enough to follow the vehicles driven by the subjects or

suspects in the case.

Consideration must be given to changing automobiles

and or license plates.

Photographic equipment

can be used in practically all types of surveil-

In this connection, the various.

types of still- and, movie-

camera equipment that the Bureau has available and which are described

elsewhere in this manual should be kept in mind.

Radio equipment can often be utilized

to advantage on surveillances;

however, care must be taken not to utilize such equipment if it will

attract attention by being conspicuous.

Although cash is not ordinarily considered as equipment, it is very

essential that the Agents on surveillances provide themselves with

sufficient cash to enable them to operate without the use of credit cards

and in some cases GTRs.

A supply of small change is essential,

especially nickels and

dimes, for use in making phone calls at unusual

requesting

such devices, include photographs, measurements, and other

informative data which

will be needed to

build the items.

Full justifi-

cation for the request must be included.

DRESS OF AGENTS ON SURVEILLANCES

It is extremely important that Agents on surveillanoes dress in such a

manner so as not to attract attention by looking out of place in the areas

where they are working:

They should at all times try to blend into the

background and make themselves as inconspicuous as possible.

This may

involve wearing sweaters, slack outfits,

or overalls in

some situations and

in others may even require the wearing of formal attire.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT UNDER SURVEILLANCE

Agents on surveillances should familiarize themselves with the file of a

case and utilize every other possible means of

obtaining a knowledge of

the subject that they are to have under surveillance.

Agents going

on a surveillance to relieve other Agents should, wherever

possible,

SURVEILLANCES AND RAIDS

ACTIVITIES OF AGENTS ON SURVEILLANCES

I. It is of paramount importance that Agents on surveillances aot perfectly

natural at all times.

Any indications of self-consciousness or unusual

aotions or appearance of the Agents will, of course, assist the subject in

verifying any suspicions he may have that he is under surveillance.

20

Agents on surveillances must be constantly on the alert for countersurveillances

on the part of accomplices of the subject.

For example, when a surveillance

is being conducted on foot, it is desirable to have one

of the Agents walk on

the opposite side of the street from the subject in order that he might be in

a position to observe any countersurveillance activities on the other side of

the street.

Agents on fixed surveillances must, of course, always be on the

alert for microphone plants and taps on the telephones being used by the

The use of contacts,

sources of information and confidential informants

should not be overlooked by the Agents

on surveillances.

example,

the event a subject registers in a hotel, considerable information can be

obtained among the employees and management of the hotel if informants have

been developed among them.

4.

Agents on surveillances should constantly keep in touch with thelsupervisor

(sac in cases of major importance Jin order that he might be continually

informed of the developments in the case.

It is extremely important that

Agents immediately communicate with

the[supervisor (or SAC) ]when the surveil-

lance is lost by one particular Agent in order that this Agent might be able

to catch up with the surveillance again the next time the Agents who are

following

The importance of the coordination of the

cannot be over-emphasized, and in order that

this might be effective,

is necessary for the Agents working on the surreil-

lance to be in communication with

the[supervisorlas frequently as this can be

done without attracting attention.

RENTING OF PREMISES FOR USE IN FIXED SURVEILLANCES

Fixed surveillances from automobiles parked on the street are usually good

for only a few hours

due to the faot that the cars become conspicuous.

Prior to renting quarters,

care must be taken to first ascertain the

a pretext should be used; how

ever, the Agent developing the pretext should be careful not to evolve some

situation which might be even more embarrassing than the truth.

such use

of pretext requires careful thought and planning.

In many instances the

Agent must disclose his official

identity in order to obtain suitable

quarters for the surveillance; however,

in such instances, the intimate

details of the surveillance and the case under investigation should never

be disclosed to the person contacted no matter how reliable he may appear

to be.

When quarters are rented for a fixed surveillance, telephones should be

installed in order to enable the Agents on surveillance to communicate with

the office and with the Agents on the outside.

The Agents on a fixed surveillance should use extreme caution to prevent

fire hazards.

Their personal habits and conduct should be such that there!

will be no rause for complaini from neighbors or those from whom the

property is rented.

The arrival and departure of Agents assigned to the surveillance should be

arranged at a time when there will be the least possibility

of

arousing

suspicion on the part of subject or other persons in the building.

Agents

going to and from

the premises must be constantly on the lookout for

countersurveillances on the part of subject or his accomplices.

All Bureau property taken to

the place of a fixed surveillance

must be

completely inventoried.

This action should be done before the property is

moved into the quarters to be occupied. When such property is removed, or

when the surveillance is abandoned, the property removed must be checked

off the inventory.

With the abandonment of such a surveillance, a thorough

and detailed search of the premises must be made to prevent the

property, or the subsequent identification of Bureau Agents through

the tracing of such property.

Serial numbers and other identifying informa-

tion should be removed from such equipment before it is taken to the prem-

PLANNING SURVEILLANCES IN ADVANCE

1.

Certain types of surveillances,

such as the surveillance of pay-off spots"

in extortion cases, can and must be carefully planned in advance and

each

of the Agents assigned

to

the surveillance should

know exactly what his

duties are and just what is expected of him in this particular assignment.

A careful survey of the pay-off spot should, of

course, be made in advance

and the details of the location and the surrounding terrain explained to

the Agents by blackboara diagrams or other illustrative methods.

2.

In other types of surveillances, certain problems arise again aud again

which can and should be planned

in advance.

For example, the problem of

taking over a surveillance at a railroad station comes up very frequently

in most field offices, and are is no reason why detailed plans cannot be

worked

out in advance and discussed at Agent conferences so that all the

Agents in the office will know the details of such plans.

The same pro-

cedure should be worked out for handling surveillances at airports and bus

terminals, as

well

as

other surveillance problems peculiar

PLANNING RAIDS

Every raid should be carefully planned in advance to insure the greatest

laotor of safety to the raiding party and innocent bystanders,

One individual designated as a raid commander should be responsible for

planning and conducting of the raid, and it is his responsibility to see

that all members of the raiding party are aware of the parts they are to

take in the raid and he alone should be charged with the duty of changing

plans and issuing orders as the situation may

3.

As careful and detailed reconnaissance as

time permits should be made of

the vicinity of the place to be raided, noting all avenues of escape,

as doors, windows, skylights, fire escapes,

streets, alleys, and roads.

confederates of the person being sought may be residing near

to be raided. During this investigation

it can be determined whether

Agents could be stationed in neighboring

homes or apartments.

the Agents participating in the raid.

4.

On the basis of the information available, the raid commander must deter-

mine the number of persons to be in the raiding party,

the time when the

raid is to be conducted, the equipment necessary, and issue instructions

so that each individual

Agent on the raid will know exactly what is ex-

pected of him and just what action he should take under circumstances

which can be readily foreseen.

In planning raids, the following questions

must be determined by the raid commander:

Number and

selection of raiding party

The party should include only Agents who are properly qualified

in handling firearms; in the event local officers are needed to

assist, these officers should have the same qualifications.

the Agents and officers on the raid should know

other so that they will be able to recognize each other under

emergency circumstances.

The number of men needed on a raid

depends on the circumstances.

The raiding squad should be

divided into such groups as are necessary in conducting

These groups should be instructed in their duties,

certain of them being informed of the fact that they will enter

the premises to make the arrest and others will be charged with

the responsibility of

covering

this activity in order to prevent

the escape of the subject,

and also for the purpose of neutralizing

any hostile gunfire by persons in the house.

It will be the duty

of the covering Agents to prevent escape of

the individual sought

in the event he emerges from the house after the raiding party

(1) This will depend on the habits of the individuals sought and the

information available

as to their activities or possible future

plans.

In the event it is necessary to conduct the raid in the

night,

the necessary lighting equipment should be available.

Usually it is lound desirable to conduct raids shortly before

dawn as this permits the Agents to take their places under

and as the daylight comes permits the observation

of the place and occupants during the raid.

APPROACH TO THE PLACE TO BE RAIDED

The exact manner in which raiding Agents and cover Agents should approach

the place to be raided depends upon the type of place raided and the

surrounding territory,

In any event the approach should be made in such

a manner as not to warn the occupants of the raid objective before all

of the Agents are in their proper positions.

This may involve in some

cases leaving automobiles at a distance and

approaching the place to be

raided on foot.

When automobiles are so left, they should be securely

locked and in many instances it may well be part of the raid plan to have

these cars used for the purpose of blocking roads and other exits from the

place to be raided. When it is necessary to use a large number of

mobiles to conduct a raid, these cars should not proceed from the Bureau

office or garage in a caravan

and should not collect at any given point

near the place to be raided at any appreciable length of time prior to

the time the raid is to be conducted.

Large nunbers of sinilar cars

closely following each other during unusual hours will attract attention,

resulting in reports to the local police.

Prior to giving the signal for the beginning of the raid, the raid commander

should know definitely that all of the men are in position and have had

an opportunity to make use of whatever natural cover is available.

Both the raiding Agents and the covering Agents must utilize all natural

the raid.

Cover not only protects the Agents from hostile gunfire but

their movements and whereabouts so that they cannot be observed by

the occupants of the house or place being raided.

Il the subjects in the house being raided do not

surrender and are known

to be dangerous and desperate characters, tear gas should be utilized to

force them out of the premises.

Q. DUTIES OF COVERING AGENTS

1.

The primary dutios of covering Agents are to cover the approach of the raiding

. Agents to the house and prevent the

escape of persons sought.

Ordinarily no

Agent should fire unless he observes someone firing out of the house.

?. When persons are seen emerging from the house, they should be advised

raiders'

identity and called upon to surrender,

If, however, they come out

of the house shooting, the covering Agents should immediately return fire.

3. It is the duty of covering Agents to guard against possible attack by con-

foderates of the occupants

of the raided house who may come up from the rear

either to assist the subjects in the house or possibly due to the fact that

they are unaware that the raid is in progress.

The covering Agents must also

guard against the possibilities of accomplices residing in adjacent houses

or apartments.

4.

It

should be realized that raid commanders assign sufficient personnel

......

to all areas outside the premises to meet any

reasonable emergency that

may arise.

Members of a raiding

congregate when any

activity

should not leave their posts and

arises.

In doing

previously assigned to the Agents will be left unguarded,

and in the event

of shooting, it

is highly possible that some

of the Agents may find them-

selves in the cross fire of other Agents.:

5.

The covering Agents should remain at their positions of duty until the raid

commander instructs them to leave.

6.

When possible, covering Agents should locate and disable automobiles of the

occupants of the house

as soon as possible after arriving at their posts in

to hamper the escape of the occupants should this be attempted.

7:

The raid commander should give consideration and make any necessary plans in

connection with the notification of police that a raid is in progress when

the circumstances appear to make such action advisable:

ACTION TO BE TAKEN AFTER THE RAID

1. [Deleted]

2.

All persons apprehended during a raid

should be taken under proper guard

to the place where they are to be detained.

Where the possibility exists of other members of the subject's gang coming

to the house that has been raided,

a sufficient number of Agents properly

should be left in the house

These Agents must conduct

themselves in such a manner as to not arouse

suspicion and warn confederates

of the apprehended persons that the former occupants are no longer there.

4.

All raids should be conducted as secretly as possible and without resulting

in undue publicity.

The names of participants in a raid should not be

• disclosed without prior Bureau authority.

Should anyone be killed during

a raid and inquest by local authorities is necessary, arrangements can

usually be made for one or two Agents to testify for the entire raiding party.

5.

Agents on a raid

should never indulge in promiscuous shooting and should

constantly bear in mind the Bureau's rule that Agents should shoot only in

self-defense.

S. BLOCKING OF ROADS

Several situations may

arise which will require that one or more roads be

The point selected should be located where natural cover is

afforded for the Agents engaged in this work, such as where a roadbed

is cut through a hill or where concrete abutments or bridges are available

for cover.

Consideration should be given to locating the point of

blockade at a place where it cannot be observed from a distance and

thereby enable the approaching cars to turn around and go back without

approaching the blockade.

Wooden barricades and stop signs can be

utilized in telling the

vehicles to travel in

one lane.

Several cars

should be permitted to pass through one direction and then several from

the other direction so that the traffic will not be unauly delayed. In

addition to the Agents working at the point of blockade, other Agents

To block a road

and stop a specific automobile can be done by selecting

a point in the road which is relatively narrow and extending a rope or

cable across the road with a stop sign attached to

the center.

of the rope or cable can be fastened to a tree or some other similar

object on one side of the road and the rope then laid flat across the

road and the other end wrapped around a tree or pole in such a manner

will permit the rope-to

be pulled taut across the road and securely

lastened.

Agents can be stationed under cover to pull up the rope or

cable when the wanted car approaches.

Other cars will not be stopped

and can easily drive across

the rope

or cable as it lies on the road.

This cable or rope should be placed across the road diagonally so that

if the wanted car is driven into the obstruction it will be deflected

sideways to the side of the road into a ditch or an embankment.

Agents should be stationed at a considerable point up the road in the

direction from which the car is expected to appear, and these Agents

have the duty of watching for the wanted car and notifying the Agents

at the barricade of its approach and also of blocking the escape of

the car if it turns around

and tries to go back.

If the wanted car

approaches the barricade and stops, Agents, properly armed, located

under cover on one side of the road should train their guns on the car

and commmand the occupants to alight.

Roads can be blocked with automobiles in those cases where a car is

expected to proceed along a certain road on which there is considerable

traffic and where it is not feasible to use either of the above methods.

This roadblock can be established by having Agents in one car stationed

beside the highway at an intersection or in a filling station, who will

. be on the lookout for

autorobile.

Agents should be stationed at a point at a considerable distance down

the road but within view of the first car so that signals may be ex-

changed.

When the wanted car approaches, the first car will signal

to the Agents in the other cars who will

drive their cars across the

road in such à manner as to completely block the road and force the

oncoming car to stop or turn around.

No Agents, of course, should re-

main inside the car which is used as a barricade.

around and attempts to turn back, the Agents in the first car can use

their car to block the road.

In general, the type of barricade used will depend upon the type of

highway, the amount of traffic on it,

the surrounding terrain, the

character of the persons

sought, and

the time available.

Blockades

should be established at a point where the road is narrow if this is

at all possible.

The point selected should be between deep ditches,

high embankments, or heavy woods to prevent the wanted persons from

driving around the barricade through open fields.

Agents covering this

point should all be placed on the same side of the road so that they

will not injure one another by cross fire.

If it becomes necessary

which has been stopped at a

barricade, you should take advantage of the cover provided by the car

itself in

approaching it.

This should be done, of course, in such a

manner as to place the

occupant of the car at a disadvantage in your

approach to him to effect an apprehension or require him to get out

the car in question.

Whenever a roadblock is established in which any Bureau personnel is

physically present and participates, it is fundamental that the Agents

be in charge of such operation and

they must make sure that the police

or any others participating furnish full cooperation.

Each SAC will be

held personally responsible to see that any such roadblock is complete

no excuse will be accepted for any such operation which proves to

be ineffective.

In planning a roadblock, definite consideration must

be given to providing for the safety of the officers participating and

• innocent citizens who can logically be expected

to run into such

roadblock on the public highway.

PLAN OF ACTION FOR MAJOR CASES

1.

Each office is to have a proposed plan of action which can become

operative automatically whenever there

is

a bombing or attempted

bombing which will be the subject of a major investigation.

a.

These investigations are to receive top priority under the personal

supervision of

the SAC and should cover all investigative steps to

insure that evidence is preserved and logical investigation instituted

immediately.

bo Immediate consideration should be given to the advisability of

requesting FBI Laboratory and/or Identification Division personnel to

proceed to the scene.

Immediately account for the whereabouts of logical potential suspects

and consider requesting nearby offices to account for the whereabouts

of potential suspects in their divisions.

[H. [Deleted]

I. SUSPECTS

1.'

Each

office is to maintain on a permanent basis an up-to-date list of

potential suspects.

When a new suspect is

added, he should be assigned

to a designated Agent who will be responsible for developing background

information as quickly as possible.

Such background information should

include suspect's residence, place

of employment, hours of employment,

description of automobile and

license number, photograph, handwriting

specimens, identification record, and whereabouts as of

the dates of

pertinent

bombings in the past.

A reliable neighborhood source should

be developed and an alternate Agent should be designated to assume

responsibility for the suspect in

the absence of the assigned Agent.

If the suspect may personally handle explosives, the latent Fingerprint

Section should be requested to include him in the appropriate section

of the single fingerprint explosives file.

The effectiveness of this

file will depend upon

the field offices furnishing complete information

Irom their files.

This should include

the names and aliases, as well

as descriptions and arrest or FBI numbers of suspects.

In this

connection the Bureau is not interested in the names

of known safecrackers

or persons known to have

explosives unless it is indicated that

they may become involved in bombings.

2.

It is not necessary to maintain a pending file on each suspect; however,

an appropriate administrative device should be maintained to insure

that place of residence and employment and description of automobile will

be verified each

six months. (FD-398 may be used for this purpose.)

E. INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE

A preliminary investigation normally covers all of the below-listed procedures.

A limited investigation normally covers all of the below-listed procedures

with the exception the subjects are not interviewed unless they voluntarily

desire to furnish information.

Thoroughly interview complainant and/or victim obtaining complete data,

including names and addresses of subjects, additional victims, and poten-

tial witnesses.

2. Ascertain reliability and background of the complainant, victim, and/or

30

Identify subjects and, if possible, suspects and interview them. If any

subject, set forth reason in report.

If the subject, be he a police officer or otherwise, requests the inter-

view be conducted in the presence of his superior or any other single rep-

resentative of his choosing, the interview may be conducted provided

approval of the SAC has been obtained.

The interviewing Agents should

insure they do not volunteer the information they will conduct the inter-

view of the subject under such conditions prior to making efforts to conduct

an unrestricted interview. Any difficulty experienced in connection with

interview of a subject law enforcement officer must be brought to the atten-

tion of the Bureau immediately.

If a Chief of Police or acting head of

such department declines or indicates a reluctance to make a police officer

available for interview, you should nevertheless advise such official that

it will be necessary to

personally contact each police officer involved for

a personal expression of his desires.

Your office must then contact each

officer personally and ascertain whether or not he desires to be interviewed.

4. Interview not only available pertinent witnesses but all known eyewitnesses

to the incident.

5. Check jail and

court records when victim has been arrested. If the com

plaint relates to a federally protected activity, determine what complaints

have been made to local authorities regarding the act of interference and

6.

what, if any, action is contemplated or has been taken.

Check hospital records and interview doctors if victim or subject received

hospital attention and also identify and interview all persons present when

victim received medical attention

as well as the persons who transported

or accompanied victim to the hospital or doctor. If victim required

medical treatment and if warranted, have victim execute FD-465 (Authority

to Release Medical Information), if

he appears legally competent.

under age, FD-465 should be executed by parent or legal guardian.]

7.

Take appropriate color and black and white photographs of complained-of

injuries or damage to property if possible and locate and preserve any

physical evidence.

8.

After completion of investigation, unless Bureau instructs otherwise, USA

should be contacted for his views

as to merits of particular case and

whether or not further investigation is desired.

If he suggests further

investigation, a report should be submitted showing information developed

and views of USA. Advise Bureau by wire or airtel, depending on urgency,

of specific investigation requested, and conduct investigation unless infor-

mation known to your office indicates request should be referred to Dépari-

ment before proceeding. USA is not to be advised of your action in this

regard.

If USA is unable or unwilling to furnish his views at time of initial con-

tact, he should be followed on a day-to-day basis until such is obtained.

If USA indicates he desires to furnish his views directly to Department or

views will not be forthcoming promptly, set forth this in report with state-

ment to effect that in light of comments of USA, this matter will no longer

be followed with USA for his determination unless specifically requested

by Department. Report should not be delayed to report additional inves-

tigation but a supplemental report submitted. USA cannot decline prosecu-

tion inasmuch as final determination of prosecution rests with Civil Rights

Division of Department.

Consequently, no arrests are to be made or com-

plaints filed without

Bureau authority.

SILTUID OF LIMIFATIONS

since the crime of conspiracy is not complete until an overt act has been

completed in the furtherance of

agreement between two

persons, the statute of limitations doas not begin to operate until az

overt act by one of the conspirators has been comnitted.

Likerise, if a

series of overt acts is committed in the furtherance of

the original agree-

the stacute of limitations begins to operate anew upon the commission

of each act, and the proper nanner

to determine when the statute of limitatio's

operates on a conspiracy violation is to determine the date of the last overt

conspiracy is a continuing offense.

If an agreement between to or

more persons to violate a lan of

the U. S. were made in 1910 and successive

acts in the furtherance of that

agreement took place each year until

1955, the statute of limitations would not operate until 1900: Of course,

the question of whether the original agreement continues through a lengthy

period is a question o1 lact lor

the jury.

COURT DECISIONS

Prool cf meeting of minds by intelligent and deliberate agreement to conmit

offense establishes

"conspiracy," though

agreement is not manifested by

formal words.

Hoifman v. U. S., 68 I. 2d 101.

Under

this

section it is sufficient that it

be the conspirators: purpose to

commit a willful fraud on the law,

statutory requirement pertirent

to be observed, in view of the present controlling conditions; and it is

not necessary

that there should be a conspiracy to do an act that is an

offense or crime by some statute of the general Goveramezi,

or to deprive

the U.S. of its property or some property right.

0. S. 7. Raley, 173 F. 159.

This statute is broad enough in its terms to include any conspiracy for the

purpose of impairing, obstructing:

or defeating the lariul function of any

department of the Government.

Haas v. Henkel, 216 U. S. 462.

One defendant alone cannot be convicted of conspiracy. Bartkus t. U.S.,

Anyone who,

after a conspiracy is formed and who knows of its

existence,

joins

therein, becomes as much a party thereto, from that time, as if he

had originally conspired. U. S. v. Cassidy, 67 F. 698.

U. S. v. Richards, 149

F, 443. U. S. v. Cole, 153 F. 801.

Purpose of overt act is to show that the conspiracy was actually carried

into operation.

U. S. v. Greene, 115 I. 343.

Provision that there must be an overt act merely afforas a "locus penitentia"

so that before the act is done either one or all may abandon their design.

U.S. v. Britton,

108 U. S. 199.

Altlough a conspiracy to violate any Federal statute is a violation of

'atle 18, USC, & 371, jurisdiction is assumed only over conspiracy to

violate substantive statutes within the primary investigative jurisdiction

of the FBI.

Complaints received alleging conspiracies to violate statutes

not within

the FBI's primary

investigative jurisdiction saould be promptly

furnished the appropriate investigative agencies.

Go INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE

A set plan for investigations of conspiracies cannot ie accurately

While the same elements

are necessary in each conspiracy case,

the object of the conspiracy

may be a violation of any one of the

statutes or simply to defraud the U. S.

In this way each case presents

different problems.

Also, there is

a wide latitude in the kind

of proos,

since circumstantial evidence of a general character indicating both the

agreements and the overt acts is admissible.

The following suggestions

of essential information

each of the elements,

In connection with establishing the agreement, ascertain the identities

of all persons concerned with the possible agreenent.

This should include

complete data as to names, aliases,

addresses, descriptions, the extent

of the previous associations of subjects in prior criminal

operations

sinilar to those under investigation, and

the degree of business, social,

or criminal intimacy in general.

3.

Evidence of all acts, meetings,

and transactions betreen the subjects

Procure all evidence possible from

documents,

formal contracts,

memoranda, or other papers.

Ascertain what

verbal statements, admissions, or confessions each

jects may have made from which

the agreements or conspiracy may be

indicated.

Obtain evidence of the acts or transactions,

statements,

or communications of subjects that would indicate the existence of

mutual plan and purpose.

Bear in mind that while

it is not necessary to prove the existence of

a formal agreement in the nature of a contract it still is necessary

to prove that two or more persons had a meeting of the minds in the per-

fection of a plan haring as its object the violation of any law of the

U.S. or committing any fraud

against the U.S. in order to fulfill the

requirements of element i;

that is,

the existence of an agreement.

It will be helpful in the investigation of this type of case if

Agent considers the completed crime of conspiracy to consist of, first,

the agreement,

and then the commission of one or more actual overt acts

in the furtherance of the original plan.

With regard to proving overt

acts, the Agent should obtain evidence

as to each act or transaction

engaged in by one or more of the subjects for the purpose of carrying

out the original agreement.

This necessitates not only establishing

the dates and places but also circumstantial evidence that the act in

question furthers the conspiracy.

Any physical act on

the conspirators consti-

tutes an overt act in the fulfillment of element $2.

If two individuals

conspired to rob a national bank and one of then purchased an automobile

getaway car,

the purchase of the automobile would be an overt act

added to a previously proved agreement to rob the bank, would

complete the crime of conspiracy.

Bear in mind that where evidence of the agreement is vague intensive

investigation of all overt acts frequently leads to evidence proving

the agreement.

Therefore,

in the case of the automobile, it it was

the subjects-mentioned to the automobile salesman that he

and a friend planned to use the automobile as a getaway car,

evidence would tend to prove both the overt act of purchasing the auto

mobile and the agreement.

Investigative steps and procedures

Preliminary steps

Carefully review subject's selective service file for information which

will serve as basis for leads.

Unnecessary effort and expense can be

eliminated by thorough and analytical review of selectzze service

file preliminary to investigation, and no investigatian should be con-

ducted prior to such review in absence of good reason to contrary.

Large proportion of cases have been closed in past beccase subject

to be IV-F,

or incarcerated or confined in penaI or mental

institution, or

serving in armed forces, or exempt because of prior

service, or coverage, or because registration fictitious. In many

instances, selective

service files will contain information indicating

suggesting case will fall into one or another of these categories,

thus giving direction

to investigation and enabling investigator

to select procedure most likely

to prove successiul in each

without preliminary wasted motion.

In addition, revier will disclose

any obvious defects

of procedure by local board

indicating premature

referral of case

or denial of procedural rights of registrant.

In such cases, USA may desire to return case

to board, mithout

investigation, for further processing.

Placing wanted notices

To eliminate needless searches by Identification Division,

wanted notices should ordinarily not be placed until alter

preliminary investigation completed.

By this procedure,

a local

FBI, or alien registration number may be obtained which

will afford positive means of identification. When wanted-flash-

cancellation notice (FD-165) submitted to Identifacation Division

in Selective Service cases where subject being sought for interview

and process not issued, designate one copy for not. Whea subject

no longer being sought

for interview, submit FD-IGS to Identification

Division and designate one copy for NcIC.

It procass obtained prior

to location of subject for interview, make entry in NCIC Irom field

office terminal and no additional notification to INCIC is necessary.

No change in instructions concerning NCIC entries in the Wanted

Persons File concerning Selective Service subjects lor whom process.

notices and fugitive form letters submitted to Bureau in

these cases must contain, in addition to usual descriptive data,

selective service number of subject.

Wanted notices must be

promptly canceled when purpose has been serted.

Police depart

should be requested to place number and address of all

subjects' local boards on fingerprint cards submitted by them

in space provided for "Arrest or Receipt.*

Wanted notices should not,

law enforcement agencies.

No objection to requesting local law

enforcement agency to be

on alert for particular subject,

but care

to advise law enforcement agency when subject is

no longer wanted.

Subjects believed to be unacceptable for military service

eliminate needless investigation, Agents must be alert to any information

indicating subjects may be

unacceptable for induction.

Gast judgment and

common sense must be exercised

to insure that investigative time and effort

are not wasted on these cases.

Physically or mentally unfit

When information of this type which would affect registrant's

classification is received in case in which evidence of milful

violation not developed, discuss facts with USA. If USA has no

Morally unfit

Information developed showing a registrant is not morally fit

for induction

under established standards (Army Regulations 601-270)

local board should be contacted to determine whether subject should

be placed in class IV-F.

form FD-411 should be prepared.

Regulations 601-270, past criminal record may be waived by armed

forces and subject accepted for service.

in requesting investigation in these cases where facts clearly indicate •

the subject is not acceptable to the military.

developed during the course of investigation indicating subject would

be unacceptable to the armed forces for physical, mental, or moral

the investigation

should be discontinued and these facts called

Upon receipt of confirming report from USA, board is authorized to cancel

registration as fictitious.

Upon receipt of such a case from USA,

investigation should be made promptly to ascertain whether registration

is fictitious:

Ordinarily, this can be determined by checking out all

information furnished by subject at time of registration.

If information

is false or cannot be substantiated, registration may be considered ficti-

tious, and lore all shoula be prepared, of which USA must receive

a copy. Although fictitious registrations may be motivated by desire for

be made with looal authorities so that appropriate Bureau offioe will

be notified if individuals within registration ages are arrested on

legitimate local charges and do not possess registration certificates or

notices of classification so it may be determined whether they are

-delinquent for nonregistration or other reasons.

It is to be clearly

understood and imparted to local authorities that no arrests or detentions

for sole purpose of determining whether an individual is in possession

of registration certificate or notification of classification are desired.

such action may constitute

, illegal arrest or detention and Bureau will not

be party to such activities on part of local authorities who may be over-

zealous or attempting to use this aot as authority for arrest of individuals

in instances where no grounds for arrest under local laws and ordinances.

Detention of an individual on charge of "hold for FBI," or any similar

phraseology,

while registration is being verified must be neither requested

nor tolerated.

It is responsibility of SAC to advise USA of above policy

so there will be no misunderstanding on his part as to course of action

Bureau will pursue in these cases.

There are numerous persons and

organizations opposed to the act

who will distort facts and take any

action necessary to bring act into public disfavor. Illegal

detention of "no-card" subjects will provide such persons and organizations

with exactly the ammunition they desire.

Verification of registration of subjects in police custody who do not

possess registration certificate or notice of classification

If subject in custody of local police without cards and has NOT been

charged with and arraigned on local offense:

Immediately advise USA subject is being held and steps are being

taken to ascertain his selective service status and determine

whether USA authorizes prosecution for failure to possess

When complaint received alleging iölamonor act, preliminary investigation

should be instituted.

COUNSELING EVASION CE ACT OR REGULATIONS; HINDERING OR INTERFERING

Organized opposition to act

A number of organizations and persons are actively engaged in formulating,

promoting, and organizing opposition to act.

Such opposition may assume

forms, such as efforts directed

toward repeal of act, encouraging

registrants to avail themselves of grounds for deferment or exemption pro-

vided by or under act, and counseling noncompliance with act through

refusal or evasion of registration,

service, or other duties imposed by

act or regulations.

these organizations may

come in conflict

with either or both of two penal provisions of section 12(a) of Title I

of act, which prohibits counseling of evasion or refusal of any of

provisions of Title I,

as well as hindering or interfering with administra-

of this title, and may also constitute violations of peacetime

sedition statutes.

Violations of the two mentioned provisions of section 12(a) may occur

either because of results

sought by organization or individual opposed

to act or because of manner in which organization or individual attempts

to achieve desired ends.

Any activities which constitute counseling, aid-

or abetting of refusal or evasion of any of provisions of Iitie I

illegal and punishable under act,

regardless of the manner in which

carried on.

On the other hand, activities directed toward repeal of act

encouragement of registrants to assert rights granted to them by act

are not in violation of Title I unless carried on in such manner as to

constitute hindrance or interference with administration of act.

example, it is possible persons advocating repeal and attempting to

influence others to join them in that purpose may picket registration

centers, local boards, eto., in such a manner as to hinder or interfere

administration of act.

No active investigation should be conducted until authorized by Bureau.

Observation of these

activities should be continued and Bureau offices

should arrange to receive information from police agencies, informants,

and similar sources.

Copies of handbills and literature should be

obtained and appropriately 'identified and preserved for possible future

Photographs of picket-line activities should be obtained, unless

On 9-27-44, the President signed Public Law 431, 78th Congress,

more comnonly known as "Expatriation Bill," which amended section 401

of Nationality Act of 1940 (Title 8, USC,

§801) and which (1) pro-

vides Ior automatic expatriation of a citizen of U.S. who departs

Irom, or remains outside of, the country during time of war or national

1481 (a) (10), Title 8,

the first pertaining to aliens and the

second

to citizens.

In reenactment of this legislation, important

changes were made.

With respect to aliens, statute excepts from its

provisions those

who are nonimmigrant aliens at time of

departure

to avoid service and who seek to reenter as nonimmigrants.

on 2-18-63 the U. S. Supreme Court in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez

and Rusk v. Cort (372 U.S.

sections 801(j) and 148i(a) (10), Titie 8, USC, pertaining to citizens;

thereby barring the U.S. from expatriating citizens who depart or

remain outside the country during time of war or national emergency

for purpose of avoiding or evading military service.

It is important to note that nonimmigrant aliens who leave to avoid

or evade training and service are thereafter ineligible to reenter

as immigrants.

Information concerning such aliens should, therefore,

be furnished by Bureau to Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)

so that any subsequent applications by such aliens for reentry as

immigrants may be denied.

Departmental Order #13-53, dated 4-20-53, and sets forth procedures

for handling delinguents who leave the U.S. under Title 8, USC,

Application of the law from an administrative

viewpoint shall thereafter be responsibility of INs.

Where

appropriate, FBI should also make such information available

USA shall notify state director of Selective Service of names,

selective service numbers,, and local boards in such cases so his

records and those of local boards may be appropriately noted.

BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS

1.

Background

The Act for the Protection of Foreign Officials and Official Guests of

the United States was signed into law on October 24, 1972, which provides

for the concurrent jurisdiction of the Federal Government

in the investiga-

tion of certain acts committed against foreign officials and official

guests as well as property occupied by foreign governments in this

In enacting this legislation, Congress recognized and reaffirmed

that police power to investigate, prosecute and punish common crimes such

as murder,

kidnaping

should remain with the states,

also noted that at times the commission of such crimes against

officials or official

guests may adversely affect or interfere with the

conduct of U. S. foreign affairs.

Therefore, Congress felt that the

Federal Government must have jurisdiction in

situations where international

repercussions may be felt or where the incident may have some affect on

U. So foreign relations.

The Department of Justice assigned investigative jurisdiction for this

Act in those cases in which the Federal Government has an interest to the

DEPARTMENTAL INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES

1.

§ 1116

Following the precedent of USC & 1114 (Protection of Officers and

Employees of the United States), the Act adds to T18 a new § 1116

relying on the definitions and penalties in I18, USC §§ 1111 and 1112,

except that punishment of first degree is mandatory life in prison.

The term "foreign official" includes two distinct categories. With

regard to the first group, such as Chiefs of State, the purpose of the

foreign official's presence in the U.S. is immaterial.

With regard to the second

group, that is "officials or employees of a

foreign government or international organization duly notified to the

United States," their coverage under the. Act requires they be foreign

nationals and

in the U. S. on official business• Such persons include

officials and employees of foreign governments at embassies, consulates,

missions and those employed at trade or commercial offices of foreign

governments.

2.

3.

The

family of a foreign official in this second category is included, but

unlike the first category, a family member's presence in the U. S.

must be in connection with the presence in the U.S. of the related

foreign official.

Coverage does not extend to the families of official guests unless the

family members are so designated in their own right by the Secretary of

State.

§ 1201

The act of kidnaping a foreign official or official guest is punishable

regard to interstate transportation of the victim. The permissible

punishment was reduced to imprisonment for any term of years of for

life, but no statutory proof of harm to the victim is required to support

any sentence which may be adjudged.

As amended by the Act, § 112 now includes assaulting, striking, wounding,

narass a foreign official or official guest or

foreign official in the performance of his duties. Protection against

PROTECTION OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS AND

STATES

obstruction extends only to foreign officials who are actually engaged in

the performance of

their duties at the time of the violation.

Although not all-inclusive, examples of violations would be:

a. Following the foreign official or official

guest about in a public

place after being requested not to do so;

bo

Engaging in a course of conduct, including the use of abusive language,

or repeatedly committing acts which alarm, intimidate, or persecute

foreign official or official guest and serve no legitimate purpose;

Communicating with the foreign official or official guest by anonymous

telephone calls, or otherwise, in a manner likely to cause annoyance

or alarm with no purpose of legitimate communication.

§ 112 (c) is intended to protect the peace, dignity and security

of foreign officials in their embassies

consulates, missions, residences,

and offices.

Note that premises of official guests are not covered

by § 112 (c).

§ 112 (c) does not apply at all to the District of Columbia wherein the

protected zone for both persons and premises begins at 500 feet.

• 112 (c) applies only to acts done publicly,

and specifically applies to

a person who parades, pickets, displays any flag, banner, sign, placard,

or utters

purpose of the conduct is to

tys to intimidate, coerce, or harass a foreigne

official or to obstruct him in the performance of his duties.

The terms used in § 112 (c) "purpose" and "intent" require proof that

the person or persons allegedly violating this section were knowledgeable

that the person or premises against which the alleged violation occurred

were covered under the Act. Requirement for proof of knowledge ordinarily

would be by putting violators on notice of the provisions of the Act.

This is in sharp contrast to all other punitive provisions in the Act.

where such knowledge by the person or persons perpetrating the crime is

immaterial. The fact that the person or premises is covered under the

Act, however, must. be alleged and proved in order to show FBI jurisdiction.

D.

guests, trade and commercial offices of foreign governments, and premises

and property of international organizations, this section also covers

automobiles and other vehicles and personal

property, under requisite

ownership, use or possession.

Whether the property is used for official

or unofficial purposes is immaterial. Only property located within the

United States is covered.

PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF TREASURY DEPARTMENT

The Act does not limit or interfere with the power of the Secretary of

Treasury in the discharge of his statutory protective responsibilities.

Service may take such action as may be necessary to implement these responsi-

bilities.

However. the Secret Service shall advise the FBI of

the initiation of: ch action as soon as possible and the results

thereof.
