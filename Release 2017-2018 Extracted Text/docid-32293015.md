partner formerly had a music box in their place which belonged

to Jefferson Music Company.

Approximately a year before they

closed they had Jefferson

Music Company take the box out and

they bought their own music box and put it in the lounge.

They did this, not because they were dissatisfied with their

financial arrangement with Jefferson Music Company, but because

they could keep all of the proceeds

purchased.

NO. 1133 said that PLANCHE was not bothered or

intimidated by the Jefferson Music Company,
