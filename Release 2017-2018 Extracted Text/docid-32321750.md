Re: 62-HQ-1029205, 01/21/1998

two documents that opens the identity of Ricardo Anibal Morales

Navarrete as a source.

In the material being processed for

release there are other documents that describe the death of the

informant in Miami on 12/22/1982.

Since the Board's instructions

are to release any known deceased informant without evidence to

justify the postponement, the Board asked for evidence to support

the postponement.

Based on the informants death and no known

threats to relatives, the Board would not protect the informant

because he did not meet their criteria of revealing "

...the

intormation...

understanding of confidentiality currently requiring

be so karen that it outreighs

protection. and disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs

the public interest....

Although the source testified at the Bosch Avila

trial on

Crederal charges of damaging foreign nations' vessels

that were trading with Cuba in 1968, he continued providing

information to the FBI. The source was also known as MM 1550-KS

(Key Source) (IS - Cuba), who first started reporting information

to the FBI in 1961.

Initially he reported on information related

to Cuban exiles in the United States and then focused on Orlando

Bosch Avila and the Cuban Power Action Group's plans to blow up

freighters.

The information in the released documents concerns

the informant's knowledge of Avila's actions that lead to his

conviction.

However, after 1968, the MM office continued to

accept information from the source.

In November 1974, the source

moved to Venezuela and helped the Venezuelan government locate

Avila who was a federal fugitive at the time. After this he

accepted a position with the Venezuelan government and continued

to provide information to the MM office about attempts of groups

in Venezuela to overthrow the Cuban government.

"/# The Board voted to release information that

reveals the source.

The information and informant were

eventually used by federal authorities in the Avila trial.

However, there are other documents from the source's file that

will be reviewed as assassination records according to the Act.

Most of the material relates to the bombing matters

that

eventually went to trial. However, some information is related to

the time Avila was a fugitive in Venezuela and the MM source was

passing that information to the MM office. The concern of this

office is the information not yet addressed by the Board that

reveals the MM source continuing his cooperation while he served

as a Venezuelan official.

Currently in the other documents, not

yet reviewed by the Board, the only information proposed for

postponement is an attempt to protect the MM informant's

cooperation while he was a Venezuelan official.

(U)

Before the documents were reviewed by the Board,

HERU contacted MM's Chief Division Counsel (CDC) Bill Dolde

concerning the harm to any family or any other concerns the MM

office could have regarding the release of the informant's

identity.

The opinion of MM was that should the Board vote to

release the identity, then the MM Office would not object to the

release.

However, MM could not locate their file and did not

know about the Venezuela information.

(U) HERU requests NSD to review the information and

give OGC and OPCA a recommendation concerning the release of the

informant.
