• It is to be noted the telephones of RAYMOND PAUL VARA,

unlisted number 453-8840, Canton, Ohio, are located in his

attention regarding any gambling activities at VARA's residence.

It is further noted VARA's wife, SANDRA, has

three minor children

by a previous marriage, who reside at this residence with she

and VARA and on March

27, 1967, at the time SANDRA VARA

was

interviewed at her residence, nothing was noted by the

interviewing agents to indicate there was any gambling activities

being conducted in the residence itself.

Information pertaining to VARA, which 1s set forth above,

is brought to the attention of the New Orleans for possible

future reference, in setting forth leads to the Cleveland Division

in this matter.

The Cleveland Division will continue its efforts,

expeditiously, to locate an individual who can testify to the

fact that VARA is engaged in gambling and along these lines,

the Cleveland Division, at Canton, Chie, is considering interview

of JOHN "BALDY"

WARTINO, 409 East Tuscarawas Street, operator

of the Silver Cue Billiard Parlor, associate of VARA, mentioned

in Las Vegas report of SA JAMES GEORGE THOMAS, dated March 13,

1967, captioned, "FRANK JOSEPH MASTERANA, aka. Frank Joseph

Masterana, Jr is

IGA, 00: Las Vegas"

As noted by the Las Vegas Division, careful consideration

must be given prior to an interview with MARTINO as not to

jeopardize LV 228-C-TE, who is the original source of information

regarding contact between MASTERANA and MARTINO through the

use of registered mail.

The investigative period covers only that time since

this matter was reopened for investigation as a result of a

request from the New Orleans Division on March 10, 1967.
