DIRECTOR, FBI (92-6054)

SUBJECT:

O LA COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

Re report of SA LEONARD H. MC COY dated 8/21/64

at New York, which is a summary pertaining to membership

activities,

etc. "of captioned organization.

It will be noted that the history, leadership and

membership of the Milwaukee family of La Cosa Nostra are set

in some detail as furnished by MI 623-C-TE.

This is to call attention to the fact that any

â€¢ dissemination of such extensive information pertaining to so

small a family as Milwaukee might constitute a very real threat

to the security and,

Since, under their system, only members of La Cosa Nostra know

for certain who the other members are, 1t would not be difficult

for the leadership to check the entire membership for a leak--

provided it became known or suspected that such a leak existed.

For this reason the Milwaukee Office confines all specific

information about membership of La Cosa Nostra to administrative

pages in reports that go to the USA.

In the event any

dissemination outside the Bureau is made of referenced report,

it is believed that the sections pertaining to Milwaukee should

be revised to show a less complete coverage.
