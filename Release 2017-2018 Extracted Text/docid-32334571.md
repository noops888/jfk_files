DIAS, in the presence of MM 636-S, told CABRARA

he could supply weapons and CABRERA expressed interest in

making a sizeable purchase, indicating that he wanted to

furnish them to sone political followers of former

Venezuelan President PEREZ JININE, who is now in prison

in Venezuela. Informant said that during this meeting,

DIAZ expressed the opinion that 1f "LBJ" becane President,

the United States would go communist and he renarked that

there existed some secret organizations, such as the

"Winutenen," who would fight to the end and that in his

opinion, there could be a military coup. DIAZ mentioned

some place, not in Florida, where the

"Minutenen"

reportedly organized. At no time, hovever, did DIAL state

that he is a member of the "inutemen" or that he had sold

arms to then. Also, DIAZ did not say that the "inutemen"

plan an arnod insurrection against the United States Govern-

ment, le claimed, however, that his brother, PabLo, had

some connections with groups of this sort but did not

specifically mention the "Winutenen."

Also, he did not

claim the existence of any "Hinutenen" military caups in

Florida.

I. JOE VIDAL, CIA 11a1mon,

telephonically inguired concerning background intor-

nation on MM 635-S, under his true name, and requested

identity of the Cuban who had been arzested wich him in

the mid-1950%s.

Since it was known that MARCOS DIAZ LAN

had been arrested with informant during that period, ciss ul

was furnished with the name of MARCOS DIAZ LAN and back-

ground internation on informant, without disclosing his

relationship with this office.

It therefore appea

that

Chown to this office but not regarded as being completely

reliable. He has been contacted concerning YALN activities

in Venezuela,

He is a former chauffeur and bodyguard to

PEREZ JIMENEZ
