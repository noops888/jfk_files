NOTE FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT:

JFK Assassination Records;

Proposal for Discussion

Jaw

We have had an exchange of memoranda on the release of

certain categories of information from the JFK assassination

files.

But a small number of lesser items remain unsettled.

I suggest that we meet for a few minutes to discuss these

items in light of the requirements of the JFK Assassination

Act.

Attached is a short list of proposed agenda items for

our discussion.
