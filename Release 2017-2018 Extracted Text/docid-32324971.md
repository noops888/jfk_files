Fe:

On November 1s 1945 Confidential Taformant CoO 5403 reported that he

had learned from JOSEPHREBERHAPDT, President, Local 139, that

EBERHARDT'S

father was a strong Conmunist Party member.

according to the informant EBER-

HARDT was' chosen in the early 1930s, to go to Russia to study the five-year plan,

but EBERHARDT indicated that he was not sympathetic to the plan and did not

go to Russia.

Confidential Informant CGO 5403 stated that EBERHARDT was closely

aligned with the Conmunists in the international offices

of the UFENNA and was

believed to be at least a Communist sympathizer.

On November 23, 1945 Confidential Informant I-4 reported that Local

139 had been out on striko since October 30, 1945.

Confidential Informant T-4fau

stated that JOSEPH EBERFERDI, President,

and JOSEPHALFOND, a member of the

Grievance Committee, had expressed a willingness to compromise the dispute

between the local and the company but JOSEPH VAN NORDSTRAND, International Repre

sentative of UFEMa, had refused. The main issue

involved in the strike was

damand for a thirty per cent increase, in wages. Confidential Informant TiE!

indicated that VAN NORDSTRAND, who has been reliably reported as a Communist,

was responsible for prolonging this strike. Confidential Informant I 4p&of

the belief that VAN NORDSTRAND's control over the locäl might be weakened since.-

several of the officials of the local had expressed a willingness to meet with

the company without the presence Of VAN NORDSTRAND. It was subsequently learned

Iron Confidential Informant 1-4 that the above mentigned strike ended on Decem

ber 30, 1945.
