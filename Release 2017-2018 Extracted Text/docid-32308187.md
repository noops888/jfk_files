Tele. Room -

Irving Davidson called me on the evening of May 25 to advitoeman.

that he had returned from about 2 weeks in Nicaragua whore he had sport

10 or 12 days with President Somoza and General Somosa.

They told him/

they did not want any part of invasion plans for other countries; that

they have enough internal problems themselves.

They indicated further

that they do not think that neighboring countdes will attack Nicaragua

and if there is any attempted invasion of Nicarague it will be possible

to handle the matter through the Organization o1 Anerican States (OAS,

Davidson sald that he had been down to kland again and taited /

to Tabernilla and faget and that they are nore andous than ever to take

acton against the Castro regime but they want U. S. sanction.

Davidson

said that Batista is very insecure in the Dominican Republic.

Davidson said that Howard Davis, who had been working with!'

Kafael Del Pino, called him last week and told Davidson he needed 24

50-caliber machine guns. Davidson told him okay, to write him a letter,

and he would contact the Munitions Control for authority and get the

guns.

However, Davis did not want any

part of this. Davidson thinks

Howard Davis i: headed for a crack-up.

Davidson said that Earl McDonald, in the Security Commission

lof the American Legion, had worked with one Pedro Massones of New York

with the idea of setting up a goodwill mission to the Dominican Republic.

He said that McDonald was a close friend of "Deloach, formerly of the FBI,"

and McDonald had been

attempting to arrange for Deloach to go down to the

(Dominican Republic. I told Davidson that he had his wires crossed because

Mr. DeLoach is presently an Assistant Director in the FBI and is certainly

not taking any trip to the Dominican Republic on a goodwill tour.

Davidson

said that McDonald was worried over the fact that he had talked up such

a goodwill trip and was concerned about his discussion with Massones in

this respect.

I contacted Mr. Deloach and be advised that he knew no une by

the name of McDonald in the Security Coumission of the American Legion nor

does he know any McDonald connected with the American Legion. Mr. DeLoach

nas not had any discussions about a trip to the dominican Republic.

This

lappears to be something dreamed up by Davidson.
