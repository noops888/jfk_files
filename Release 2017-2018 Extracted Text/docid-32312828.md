EXHIBIT II

FOREWORD.

If government is to be truly of, by, and for the people, the people

must know in detail the activities of government. Nothing so dimin

ishes democracy as secrecy. Self-government, the muximum participa-

tion of the citizenry in aflairs of state, is meaningful only with an in-

formed public. How can se govern ourselves if we know not how we

govern? Never was it more important than in our times of mass

society, when govermnent affects each individual in so many ways,

that the right of the people to know the actions of their govermment

be secure.

Beginning July 1, a most appropriate day; every executive agency,

by direction of the Congress, shall meet in spirit as well as practice

the obligations of the Public Inforination Act of 1966. President John-

son has instructed every official of the esecutive branch to cooperate

fully in achieving the public's right to know.

Public Law 89-187 is the product of prolonged deliberation. It re-

fleets the balancing of competing principles within our democratic

order. It is not a mere recodification of existing practices in records.

manngement and in providing individual access to Government docu-

ments. Nor is it a mere statement of objectives or an expression of

intent.

Rather this statute imposes on the erecutive branch an affirmative

obligation to adopt new standards and practices for publication and

availability: of information." It leaves no doubt. that disclosure is a

transcendent goal, yielding only to such compelling considerations as

those provided for in the esemptions of the act.

This memorindum is intended to assist every agency to fulfill this

obligation, and to develop common and constructive methods of im-

plementation.

No review of an area as diverse and intricate as this one can antici-

pate all possible points of strain or dificulty. This is particularly true

when vital and deeply held commitments in our democratic system,

such as privey and the right to know, inevitably impinge one against

nnother.

Law is not wholly self-explanatory or self-executing. Its

efficacy is heavily

dependent on the sound judgment and faithful

execution of those who direct and administer our agencies of

Government.

It is the President's conviction, shared by those who participated

in its formulation and passage, that this act is not an unreasonable

encumbrance. If intelligent and purposeful action is taken, it can

serve the highest ideals of a free society as well as the goals of a

well-administered government.

This law was initiated by Congress and signed by the President with

several key concerns:

-that disclosure bo the general rule, not the exception;

REWORD

-that all individ

¡ hare equal rights of access;

—that the burden be on the Government to justify the withholding

of a document, not on the person who requests it;

-that individuals improperly denied access to documents have n

right to seck injunctive relief in the courts;

that there be a change in Government policy and attitude.:

It is important therefore that each agency of Government lse this

opportunity for critical self-analysis and close review. Indeed this lan

can have positivo and beneficial infuence on administration itself-in

better records management; in seeking the adoption of better methods

of search, retrieval, and copying; and in making sure that documentary

classification is not stretched beyond the limits of demonstrable need.

At the same time, this law gives assurance to the individun! citizen

that his private rights will not be violated. The individual deals with

the Government in a number of protected relationships which could

be destroyed if the right to know were not modulated by principles of

confidentiality and privacy. Such materials as tas reports, medical

and personnel files, and trade secrets must remain outside the zone of

accessibility.

This memorandum represents a conscientious effort to correlate the

test of the act with its relerant legislative history. Some of the statu-

tory provisions allow room for more than one interpretation, and de-

finitive answers may have to arrait court rulings. Homever, the

Departinent of Justice believes this memorandum provides a sound

working basis for all agencies and is thorougbly consonant with the in

tent of Congress. Each agency, of course, must determine for itself the

applicability of the general principles expressed in this memorandum

to the particular records in its custody.

This law can demonstrate anew the ability of our branches of Gor-

ernment, working together, to vitalize the basic principles of our de-

mocracy. It is a balanced approach to one of those principles. As the

President stressed in signing the law:

"* * * a democracy works best when the people have all the

information that the security of the Nation permits. No one should

be able to pull curtains of secrecy around decisions which can be

rovealed without injury to the public interest

I sigried

this measure with a deep sense of pride that the United States is

an open society in which the people's right to know is cherished

This memorandum is offered in the hope that it will assist the agen-

cies in developing a uniform and constructive implementation of Public

Law S0-187 in line with its spirit and purpose and the President's

instructions.

Mr. Bernard Fensterwald, Jr.

Fensterwald,

Bevan and Ohlhausen

Attorneys At Law

927 Fifteenth Street, N. W.

Washington, D. C. 20.005

Dear Mr. Fensterwald:

This is in response to your letter of February 2, 1970,

requesting my review of the denial by the Deputy Attorney

General of your request under the Freedom of Information Act,

5 U.S.C. § 552, for access to official records of the Depart-

ment of Justice.

Although you requested access to several

items which the Deputy declined to make available, you have

appealed only his denial of the request for "[ajli documents

filed by the United States with the Court in England in June-

July, 1968, in the extradition proceeding by which James Earl

the convicted killer of Dr. Martin Luther King, was re-

turned to this country."

Whether or not the documents you seek are technically

exempt under one or more of the provisions of § 552(b), I

have determined that you shall be granted access to them.

The exemptions do not require that records falling within

them be withheld; they merely authorize the withholding of

such records by exempting them from the Act's otherwise ap-

plicable compulsory disclosure requirements.

Sincerely,

62-109960-4167

STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT JOHNSON

UPON SIGNING PUBLIC LAW

89-187 ON. JULY 4, 1966

Tho measure I sign today, S. 1160, revises soction 3 of the Admini-

istrative Procedure

Act to provide gurdelines for the public avail-

ability of the records of Federal departments and arencies.

This legislation springs from one of our most essential preciples:

& democracy works best when the people have all the information that

the socurity of the Nation pornits. No one should be able to pull cur-

tains of secrecy around decisions which can be revealed without injury

to the public interest.

At the same time, the welfare of the Nation or the rights of indi-

viduals may require that some documents not be made available. As

• Jong as threats to peace exist, for example, there mist be military

secrets. A citizen must be able in confidence to complain to his Govern-

ment and to provide information, just as he is--and should be free

to confide in the press without fear of reprisal of of being required to

reveal or discuss his sources.

Fairness to individunks also requires that information accumulated

in personnel fles be protected from disclosure. Officials within Gorern-

ment must bo able to communicate with one another fully and frankly

without publicity. They cannot operate effectively if required to dis-

close infonnation prematurely or to make public investigative files

and interal instructions that guide them in arriving at their decisions

& know that the sponsors of this bill recognize these important in-

terests and intend to provido for both tho need of the public for access

our Constitution to provide for confidentiality when the national in-

terest so requires. Thore are some who havo expressed concern that the

language of this bill will be construed in such a way as to impair

Government operations. I do not share this concern.

I havo always beliered that froedom of information is so vital that

only the national security, not the desire of public oficials or private

citizens, should determine when it must be restriered.

I am hopeful that the neels I have mentioned can be seried by a

constructive approach to the wording and spirit and legislative history

of this mensure. I am instructing every official in this administration

to cooperate to this end and to make information available to the

full extent consistent with individnal privacy and with the mational

interest.

I signed this measure with a deep senso of

pride that the Unite

States

is an

open

society in which the people's right to know i

cherished and guarded
