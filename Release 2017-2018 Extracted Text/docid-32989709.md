This is to set forth apparent inconsistencies in the logic

144586

used by the House Select Committee on Intelligence in its effort to

castigate the FBI for its investigative effort in the domestic security

field.

Quotes herein are extracted from the "Draft

Final Report'' dated 1/19/76 of the House

Select Committee. The quotes are followed

by the page number wherein they appear in

the report.

The Committee maintains that "the FBI has been unable

to prove any illegal or questionable relationship between the SWP

and the Fourth International" (page 214); and that the FBI has failed

"to uncover even one questionable activity by this political party"

(215); and that "considerable resources have been allocated to com-

pound the error of a continuing unproductive investigation' (217).

This, it is alleged, has caused Americans to be concerned "about

privacy invasions of domestic security investigations" (218).

As concerns the Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro),

the Committee states the program, though aimed at "identifying,

penetrating and neutralizing subversive elements" (314), consisted of

"myriad clandestine dirty tricks" (314). "The FBI justiles this

aberration from traditional law enforcement programs by stating

that it was dictated by the mood of the times" (315).

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Houstudy

62-116464

Not satisfied with the above types of sweeping condemna-

tions, which in effect maintain that the FBI has set itself up as "the

barometer of the country's mood'' (315), which does not qualify it

"to review peoples politics" (315), the Committee nevertheless feels

free to condemn the FBI for not having done enough in the internal

security area. The Committee states that "it is obvious that the FBI

government...

overto anticipate - either the eat provide is existing

attorneys with a detailed after-the-fact history of the SL.A. However,

the FBI was apparently unable to anticipate the formation of the group

or thwart its initial criminal activities" (underscoring added)

(219, note 400).

The Committee's position therefore is this: if the Bureau,

lacking statutory definition precisely outlining its authority, investi

gates a group (or individual) because of its potential for criminal,

violent or subversive activity, or attempts to thwart that group's

activity, that group had better be one the Committee agrees is violent

or subversive. If, on the other hand, the Bureau fails to be prescient,

it is to be criticized for its failure to take preventative action against

a group which the Committee decides, based on the past record, is

"committed to violence" (219).

Apparently this is another instance where we are damned

if we do, and damned if we don't.

ACTION:

None. For information.

On 1/15/76, HSC Staff Member Charles Maddox made

available to Special

Agent Thomas J. McNiff a draft copy

(attached) of material concerning FBI.

proprietaries prepared

by him for inclusion in the final report setting forth

the results of HSC inquiry into FBI operations:

Mr. Maddox

requested that this material, as it pertains to FBI operations,

be reviewed to determine if

such information requires

classification. A separate communication has been prepared

responsive to that request. In reviewing the above draft

copy, it was noted that a section of the

report was subtitled

"Legal Aspects Concerning Proprietaries." This subsection

Astates Section 869, Title 21, U.S.C., which in essence

no corporation shall be created (or Government funds '

fused for that purpose) by any officer or agency of the

Federal Government except by an Act of Congress,

specifically

authorizing such action. With regard to the FBI's justifi-

cation for the use of incorporated proprietaries, the report

stated that the matter had been referred to the Department

Justice for a decision and unofficially quotes an FBI

spokesman as stating the question had never been raised in

house and it was assumed that

approval by the Department of

Justice

at the time such

a proprietary was initiated was

de facto proof that the operation was legal.

Exception was taken to the above statement not

only because of its inaccuracy but because of the blackguardly

above statement was speculative and no Bureau spokesman told

thim that the legal authority of proprietary operations had

not previously been considered. Maddox agreed to withdraw

Re: Houstudy 75

the above statement but explained that since proprietaries

were currently operating he would have to include in his

report the legal position of the Department and/or the FBI

Maddox then prepared

Conghand a subs tute statement (attached) which re extect

stated that the legal authority for the operation of

proprietaries is under Department consideration and his

statement concluded that such a decision should have been

made earlier and not after the fact and upon request of the

'HSC. Maddox indicated, in the absence of a specific decision

from the Department, he would utilize the above statement.

It was explained to

Maddox at this point that a Bureau

representative could not speak for the Department and a

call was placed for Mr. Steven Blackhurst, Deputy Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, to come to the FBI

Building to review the above longhand statement. Mr. Blackhurst,

after reviewing the statement, advised that he could not

speak for the Department's position in this matter and it

agreed that Maddox would withhold the draft copy of his

report until approximately 1/21/76 at which time Blackhurst

agreed to contact Maddox with the Department's position if

such had been formulated.

OBSERVATIONS:

Legal Counsel Division is aware that the Department

currently has under study the legal authority for use of

incorporated proprietaries. It is noted that the Department,

prior to the HSC inquiry, was cognizant that the two

proprietaries in question involved corporations. If the

Department on such short notice is unable to legally justify

the operation of these proprietaries, it appears that two

courses of action remain open to the Department. One would

be to maintain that the matter is currently under consideration

while the second is a statement that the Department can find

no legal justification for these operations. In the latter

event it would appear the two operations would have to be

discontinued in the immediate future. Either of the above

two positions would appear to reflect unfavorably upon the

Department as the former infers that the Department had not

considered Section 869, Title 21, U.S.C., while the latter

admits the Department had at the very least knowledge of an

operation, which operation was in violation of a Federal

statute.

It would appear that the interest of this Bureau

could best be served by the Department engaging in thorough

research to determine whether the above-stated statute applies

to operations approved by Government officials and designed

of another statute permitting these type operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

That representatives of Legal Counsel, Special

Investigative and Intelligence Divisions meet with appropriate

Department officials to resolve:

1) Appropriate wording setting forth the Bureau

and/or Department's position in the above matter and

recommend to Maddox inclusion of this wording in the HSC

report being prepared by him.

Legal Aspects Concerning Proprietaries

A major issue raised by the committee at the

time our investigation was started was adaressed

to

each of the military services and the FBI. This

issue was "what is your justification for establish-

ing a proprietary, normally a corporation, as a

front for carrying out an intelligence mission?"

• ..

The Committce raised this question because

"(a) No corporation shall be created, organized

or acquired on or after December 6, 1945, by any

officer or agency of the Federal Government or by

any Government corporation for the purpose of act-

ing as an agency or instrumentality of the

United States, except by Act of Congress specifi-

cally authorizing such action.

(b) No wholly owned Government corporation

created by or under the laws of any State,

Territory or possession of the United States

or any political sub-division thereof, or under

the laws of the District of Columbia, shall con-

tinue after June 30, 1948, as an agency or

instrumentality of the United States, and no

funds of, or obtained from, the United States

or any agency thereof, including corporations,

shall

be invested in or employed by any such

corporation after that date except for the pur-

poses of liquidation. ***"

The General Accounting Office in a letter to

the Committee Chairman dated December 10, 1975

(B-179296) which discussed the applicability of

section 869 to the authority for CIA to establish

proprietaries stated in reference to the legislative

history of the act stated "we have found no indica-

tion in the legislative history that Congress con-

sidered the formation of corporations for clandes-

tine purposes."

While it is recognized that the purpose of

proprietaries is to conceal the role of the govern-

ment in clandestine activities, the lack of legis-

lative history concerning formation of clandestine

corporations must be acceptad.

Thus, section 869

piecludes the formation of proprictary corporations

except by Act of Congress:

NW 55317 Docid:32989709

Page 13

---

## Page 14

Mess truet.

As discussed in the following paragraphs, the

Military services disagreed strongly with the com

mittee position in this matter. As an example, the

Army stated in essence that the provisions of sec-

tion 869 should not be applied to corporations es-

tablished for intelligence purposes by the Army

because cover corporations do not, by their nature,

represent themselves as agents of the U.S. govern-

ment and do not engage in any business activity.

The Navy, with a somewhat different ayproach,

stated that proprietaries are established for the

sole purpose of facilitating the collection of

intelligence. The Navy further stated that the

purpose of establishing a proprietary is to

provide a shield of non-attribution and that it

would be impossible to act as a U.S. government

representative without destroying the cover of

non-attribution.

The Ai: Force justified the use of proprietaries

by citing in-house approvals and approvals by the

• CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Air

Force stated in part "Justification existed in the

need

for cover for clandestine foreign intelligence

collection activities."

-

In sunmary, the military services have justifica

the use of proprictaries on a rather pragmatic basis

which sitates in escence proprictaries are

approved

NW 55317 DocId: 32989709 Page 14

in accordance with regulations, cleared by other

agencies in the intelligence community, and could

not exist for intelligence purposes if it were

known that the U.S. government had an interest in

the operation of the curporation.

The FBI has referred the legal question as to

whether they

can operate, a proprietary to the Depart-

ment of Justice lot a decision. Unofficially an

FBI spokesman stated the question has never been

raised in-house and they assumed that approval by

the Department of Justice at the time each proprietary

was initiated was de facto proof that the operation.

was legal.

The Department of Justice is still re-

L viewing the legal basis for their past approvals.

Conclusion

The Committee agrees that a

non-attributable

method of providing cover for intelligence missions

is a necessity and that a corporate structure is

possibly the best way of obtaining this objective.

• The Committee does not take issue with the fact

that regulations spell out policy guidelines and

operating procedures and that there are apparently

sufficient controls to protect the interests of

the government. However, under present law,

the

formation of corporations without the consent of

Congress is not lawful.

We believe therefore, if proprictaries

REQUEST FOR DECLASSIFICATION

OF CERTAIN FEI DOCUHENTS

Reference is made to HSC letter dated December 11,

1975, which requested that certain docurents referred to

during the HSC hearing of Hovenber 18, 1975, be declassified

for inclusion in the HSC report.

Certain of these documents in question pertain

to the Administrative pages of an FBI report on the

Institute for Policy Studies (LEs), dated Warch I4, 1960.

This document,

along with others, nes originally turnished

to the ISC on

November 14, 1975, in accordance with

instructions received from the Department of Justice

in response to a request from the ISC.

it is the FBI's position that this document,

even though it is unclassified, should not be released

to the public.

In an effort to be responsive to the HSC's

request, it was agreed at a meeting on January 7, 1976,

between lis. Ellen Miller of the HSC staff and FBI

ropresentatives, that the following explanation regarding

the cover pages of the aforenontioned report would sutlice

INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR THOMAS J. JENKINS

BY TIM OLIPHANT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

CONCERNING U. S. RECORDING COMPANY

On December 9, 1975, I was interviewed by Tim Oliphant

of the House Select Committee. Present at the interview was SA John

Dennis Miller of the Office of Legal Counsel. Oliphant first informed

me that the Chairman, Mr. Pike, of the Committee was interested in

the Bureau personnel's relationship with Joe Tait of the U. S. Record-

ing Company. He pointed out that the Bureau had bought a substantial

amount of equipment from the U. S. Recording Company and had used

that company as a "cut out." He stäted that because of these purchases

the Committee was interested in the poker games held at the Blue Ridge

Rod and Gun Club since people interested in procurement for the FBI

and CIA were present at these poker parties.

Oliphant asked me when I first met Tait. I told him that to

the best of my recollection it was at the first time I went up to the Gun

Club where he was present. I told him I first went up there in the Fall

of 1971 or the Spring of 1972 and had been up there on 5 or 6 occasions

since that time. Oliphant also wanted to know if I knew Gus Oberdick.

I replied in the affirmative and he asked me when I first met Oberdick.

I told him I thought I first met him at Quantico at our firearms range

when he was exhibiting some of his equipment and thereafter I had been

with him up at the Gun Club. He asked me if I had ever been assigned

to the Administrative Division. I told him that when I first came in the

FBI as a clerk I worked in the Mechanical Section and the Photographic

Laboratory and these were under the Chief Clerk of the Bureau which

was later designated as the Administrative Division. I told him that I

had not had anything whatsoever to do with procurement and knew noth-

ing about it.

With respect to the poker parties he wanted to know who was

the host and I told him, Tait since he was a member of the Club. He

then asked me if I paid my way and how much. I replied that up until the

last time I was there it was $25 and the last time was $30. He asked if

"' Interview oi Assistant to the Director Thomas J. Jentins

by Tim Oliphant of the House Committee on Intelligence

Concorning U. $. Recording Company

any business was discussed at these poker parties and I replied in the

negative. Tie wanted to now if I had ever in my position in the Bureau

recommended any supplies or equipment be purchased by the Eureau

from Tait or Oberdic'. I told him "no"; that all requests for material

were sent to deadquarters, along with specifications and that as far as

I new, the Eureau either bought material off the Covernment Schedule

or sent out invitations to bid.

I did point out to him that I knew that dur-

ing the Wounded nes operation tve needed a large supply of flares and

tear ras in a hurry and that Oberdick got up in the middle of the night

and arranged to shin by plane all the supplies he had and arranged for

us to pet additional supplies from, I believe, Cleveland, aid as a result

te had the necessary flares and tear gas in Wounded nee the next day.

Oliphant asked me if I had associated with Jait socially or

at any other time other than at the Cun Club. I told him that I had attended

2 or 3 lunches where he was present at the Carriage House in Ceorgetown.

Ee then assed me it Tait picked up the tab and I told him, not to my knowl-

edge. He asked it I knew if there was a safe up at the Gun Club and I told

him that I never recall seeing one but that does not mean there was not

one there because there were parts of the building I was never in.

In conclusion, Oliphant advised that they had been up at the

Gun Club the day after the fire and he further stated that the Club was

sold two weeks prior to the fire to a. James Clark of Clark interprises

which has the same address as the Hyman Construction Company.

Oliphant was most pleasant during the intervier: and stated

he folt that this war just a noter party.

tha nature of the Bureau's connection with both of these

Conletces.

She was advised that, in relattonship to the Ius,

the Bureau had an important interest in defector matters

and, in fact, the responsibility fnr the exploitation of a

defecine in the United States for Internal security and

counterintelligence matters liesuith the FBI. It fas

cxplained ts her that, after the IBI's interests with regard

in such an indiviécol

are satisfied, the defector in question

then becomes the responsibility nf the CIA fox resettlement.

She inquired as to whether or not the IDd issued any

publications and she tras advised that, although the Inc

does publish a uide variety n$ mennranda concerning defector

matters, these are usually classified and restricted to the

members of the intelligence comunity.

With regard in the sc, it was explained to

Miss Yomatstn that this Committce's function is to act as

that nay arise in the sccurity field encompassing personnel

Herward was unable to recall the list purchase of

based on his testimony. He replied he knew of no runors or

Kalser was obligated to tell the truth to the best of his

FBI LTERVIEWS OF MARTIN L. KAISER

DECEMBER 15 and 23, 1975

By letter dated December 31, 1975, A. Searle Field,

Statt Director of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, complained

to the Attorney General concerning FBI interviews. His letter stated that

they would appreciate a Justice Department review of whether the FBI's

conduct violated Federal laws protecting Congressional witnesses as well

as Federal statutes concerning procurement procedures.

Attached is a carbon of the reply letter from the Deputy

Attorney General which I understand was signed by the Deputy on

January 7, 1976. The concluding paragraph advises Chairman Pike

of the Committee that the Department "will investigate this matter

immediately to determine whether any undue pressure was exerted

on Mr. Kaiser in violation of federal law."

While the letter does not indicate the form of the Department

investigation, I have been advised that the inquiry will be supervised

by Michael Shaheen acting in his capacity as Head of the Office of

Professional Responsibility and that the inquiry will be conducted by the

Criminal Division of the Department.

existence any internal regulations concerning the operation of

proprietaries, whether the Bureau's operation of proprietaries

are in violation of Section 869 of Title 31 or the u. S. Code

and

ask the Bureau to work with him in the preparation of al

to work with hi

short paragraph on proprietaries for the Committee's public

report.

The Department of Justice is, at the request of

Maddox, responding

RE: REQUEST FOR DECLASSIFICATION

1975, which requested that cantata documents referred to

during the HSC hearing of lovetber 18, 1975, he declasalfied

Certain of these documents in question pertain

to the targets of warrancless electronic surveillances and

originally furnished to the HiS in accordance vich instructions

roceived fron the Lepartment of Justice in response to

certain requests as contained in HSC letter dated

cetober 15, 1975.

It is the rBI's position that these documents,

even though they are unclassified, should not be released

to the public.

It is believed that a close study and xavier

of thase docurents by a hostile foreiga intelligence service

could provide an insight into the FBI's successes and/os

resources in the foreign counterintelligence fiole. This

is so notwithstanding the fact that the documents in question

NTE :

Attached to the yellow of this memorandum is a

copy of referenced HSC request along with a copy of the

documents the HSC desires to include in its report. It is

noted the figures being furnished the HSC to be made public

the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure

inquiry into Federal agencies' practice in the electronic

surveillance field. In addition, the AG provided the

ligures to Congressman Rodino of the House Committee on the

Judiciary and to Senator Church of the Senate Select Committee.

These figures are being proffered as they are already in the

public domain and it is felt any study of them by a hostile

foreign intelligence service would prove of no value.

This

matter was discussed on 12/19/75 by Section Chief William n.

Gregar and SA Andrew J. Duffin with Douglas Marvin, Special

Assistant to the AG, who advised that the AG agrees in this

response.

U.S. HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELIIGENCE ACTIVITIES

NOTE: During

a conference attended by SA Paul V. Daly of the

Legal Counsel

• Division, SA John McHale of the Special Investigative

Division, Michael E. Shaheen, JI., Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination in the Department, and his Assistant, Ray Hornblower,

it was explained that captioned Committee Counsel Aaron Donner had

complained to the White House concerning the Bureau's refusal to

furnish requested information on this matter.

The White House

requested they be advised by the Department of the Bureau's position

and reasons thereof. Additionally, Pete Hughes, Staff Member of

cerning this matter. Shaheen also explained that the Assistant

Attorney General of the Civil Division Rex Lee who is the Attorney

General's personal advisor concerning problems surrounding House

and Senate Select Committee requests requested he be advised con-

cerning this matter.

In a similar request, we afforded the Senate

Select Committee a briefing as opposed to the furnishing of docu-

ments giving as a reason for refusal of furnishing documents that

they involved sensitive on-going investigations.

The considerations

concerning this position are obvious, with regard to the proprie-

taries operated by the Intelligence Division, they are sensitive

on-going operations and the proprietaries operated by the Special

Investigative Division if disclosed could jeopardize the lives of

Agents and/or informants and could ultimately adversely impact on

possible prosecutions.

9:30 AM, 12/17/75

The captioned staff members were brought to the writer's office by

John Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division and left the writer at approximately

20:15 AM on 12/17/75. The purpose of their request for the interview had been

indicated to inquire into the writer's participation at poker games at the Blue Ridge

Club sponsored by Joe Tait, President of U. S. Recording Company.

Mr. Oliphant stated the purpose of the interview was as indicated above

and also asked if they could inquire into the writer's knowledge and/or participation

in connection with the purchase of equipment from the U. S. Recording Company.

Upon inquiry Mr. Oliphant was informed that the writer had partici

pated

l'in a poker party at the Blue Ridge Club on two or three occasions but not on an

occasion within the last six or so years. He was also informed that Mr. Mohr

was present on these occasions and served as a collector for the fee for

the cost

of lodging and food on the occasions the writer attended. He was informed that

Vir. Tait and Mr. Oberdick were probably present; however, no business of any

kind was discussed; it being purely a social event with the primary purpose of getting

away from shop and shop-talk. He was further advised on the occasions that the

(writer was in attendance former Assistant Director Donald Parsens was the host

member of the Blue Ridge Club. In response to an inquiry as to why the writer had

not attended in more recent years, he was informed that I did not do so after my

youngest son married and left home as I did not care to leave the Mrs. alone for

the night in our residence.

Mr. Oliphant also inquired as to any other contacts I may have had with

Messrs.Tait and Oberdick and I informed him that there was no close social

relationship such as visiting back and forth in one another's residences; however,

I had encountered them at weddings of the children of theirs and/or mutual friends,

but on these occasions no business was discussed. I further pointed out that Mr. Tait

had a summer place on the Delaware

Coast in the arewhere I likewise had one and on

a few occasions he has ridden by to

hello but has not visited extensively nor

was any business discussed during th

visits.

Memo to the Director

Re: Interview by Messrs. Timothy Oliphant and

Richard Vermere, Staff Members, House

Select Committee on Intelligence

Messrs. Oliphant and Vermere inquired as to the origin of the

relationship with U. S. Recording Company and at what level was the price for

the equipment purchased from U. S. Recording determined to be satisfactory.

The writer informed them the writer's recollection of the relationship with

the U.S. Recording Company dated back to the lated 30's or early 40's and

the procedure of purchasing confidential types of equipment was an ongoing

procedure at the time the writer became involved in the Administrative Division.

(I stated there was no fixed procedure for ascertaining the precise price oR

any markup relative thereto inasmuch as the nature of the items purchased were

such that primary reliance was left to the technicians of our Laboratory who

had shopped the industry for the equipment needed and that any detailed discussion

regarding price would normally go through the Procurement Officer of the

Administrative Division and the technicians in the Laboratory to see that a

reasonable price was being paid but not an absurb or unreasonable price.

It was

pointed out that procurement procedures in effect would require any questionable

price to be taken up with higher authority either in the Laboratory or the

Administrative Division to adjudicate such a question and to the writer's recollection

there had been no occasions when this had occurred.

Mr. Vermere inquired as to Mr. Mohr's relationship with the Laboratory

in connection with his position as Assistant to the Director and I pointed out that

there were times when the Laboratory was one of the Divisions under his jurisdiction

and I was sure that the organizational charts they had would seem to indicate this.

They inquired if I were aware of the fact that the Blue Ridge Club had

suffered a fire and I advised them I had read it in the newspaper and they advised

when they became aware of it was listening to the radio when they were going to

visit the club having heard the newscast concerning it.

Mr. Vermere inquired as to whether there was any inquiry being made

into the Bureau's dealings with the U. S. Recording Company and he was informed

Director Kelley had instructed an inquiry to be made into the matter right after

the testimony of Mr. Kaiser before the Committee for which they work. Upon

inquiry whether there was any information available as to developments to date with

regard to this matter, they were informed since this was an ongoing inquiry it

would be inappropriate at this time to discuss such with them. When asked when

the inquiry would be completed, they were informed it would be concluded very soon

Memo to the Director

Re: Interview by Messrs. Timothy Oliphant and

Richard Vermere, Staff Members, House

Select Committee on Intelligence

as the Director was just as anxious as the Committee was to have the full picture

with regard to this situation. During this discussion Vermere alluded as to the

volume of the purchase made in 1971 which intormation had been previously

furnished to the Committee and it was pointed out that these purchases resulted

from the break-in of our Resident Agency in Media, Pennsylvania, and the use

of U. S. Recording was two-fold; one, to preserve the confidentiality of the type

of equipment being installed throughout the country in our Resident Agencies and

second, to obtain expedite delivery in connection with such equipment.

I also advised Messrs. Oliphant and Vermere that purchases other

than those of a confidential nature were made from U. S. Recording Company of

items on which he was the supplier under the GSA general supply schedule and

where purchases on a competitive bid basis were made by soliciting bids for items

of equipment under this latter procedure he being on the bidder's mailing list

along with other manufacturers and suppliers. I pointed out that procurement

of all equipment adheres to the Federal Procurement Regulations prescribed by

the General Services Administration.

Please provide Mr. Charles Mattox, a member of the

staff the opportunity of an independent audit verification

of the items disclosed in the briefing.

Specifically, the committee is interested in the two

entities in the metropolitan Washington area and the cover

Further specific arrangements can be made at that time.

RE: INTERVIEN OF FORMER FBI ASSISTANT

TO THE DIRECIOR JOIN P. MOLE BY

HSC STAFF MEMBERS

Set out below is information voluntarily furnished

by telephone to the IBI by Mr. Mohr following his interview

by representatives of the Staff of the HSC in Washington, D. G.,

November 19, 1975.

On the afternoon of Novenber 19, 1975, Mohr advised

that he had just concluded an interview conducted by Nichard

Vermeire and Tin Oliphant of the HSC Staff. The intervior tas

not under oath and not recorded.

liohr was asked concerning

the U. S. Recording Company's (USIC) arrangements with the

I'BL for the purchase of electronic surveillance equipment

hohr responded that a former Assistant Director in charge of the

FBI Laboratory, Id Coffey, apparently had previously made

arrangements with the USC for the confidential purchase of

electronic surveillance equipment in behalf of the FBI and when

dohz becone the Assistant Director in charge of the Administrative

DIViSIon, he siuply concinued such arrongenents.

Ile said he

knew at no spectiic docisions that were madc to buy through

Vr. Tait of the USRE.

U. S. House Select Committee

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (HSC)

Re:

Intervlew of Former FBI Assistant to the

Director John P. Mohr by HSC Staff Members

He said that he was aware that Tait had treated Bureau purchases

as confidential and that in the past Tait has not divulged

Bureau interests.

Mohr said that Tait's usual fee for handling

purchases was a 10% to 15% mark-up plus a reasonable laboi

charge in cases where modification of equipment was necessary.

Mohr was asked whether Tait was paid as a confidential source

of the Bureau.

the fact that

Tait's company was used as a "cut out"

and that

the fee paid to Tait for such service could have been considered

payments to a confidential source for services rendered. He

was asked whether Tait had charged a 30% mark-up as alleged by

Martin Kaiser,

Mohr responded that he was not aware of instances

involving a 30% mark-up and, if such occurred, it would have

been in excess of the usual

fee paid to Tait.

Mohr advised that he was confronted by Vermeire and

Oliphant with statements allegedly made by William Harward of

the FBI Laboratory which seemed to imply that the Laboratory

referred the requests to purchase equipment to the Administrative

Division and that Mohr authorized purchases through the USRG.

Mohr indicated that the arrangements for purchasing through the

USC were based on Laboratory Division requests and not on

Administrative Division or his own requests.

He commented that

in regard to testimony by Martin Kaiser, it appeared that the

FBI Laboratory had made arrangements to purchase material

confidentially through the USIC and then went directly to the

Martin Kaiser Company, specifying the purchase order requésts,

and thereby revealing

the FBI as a purchaser from Kaiser.

said that such direct contact by the Laboratory made the

arrangements with USRG appear to be unnecessary and difficult

to explain.

Concluding, Mohr advised that it was not indicated to

him one way or the other

whether he would be called as a

witness

before the HSG.

It should be noted that Mohr was released from his

confidentiality agreement with the FBI for the purpose of the

above interview, release predating the actual interview.

where Bureau

informants

were prosecuted would be responsive

to committee's request.

Staff member specifically advised

that disclosure of informants' status could well endanger

their lives.

prepared for Mr. Adams recently with symbol numbers and

specifics set forth.

BLACK LIBERATION ARMY

The Black Liberation Army (BLA) is a loose-

knit urban guerrilla organization whose self-described

purpose is to overthrow the Government. In announcing

the BLA's purpose, the 2/29/72 issue of "Right On!,"

its official publication stated. . . "The purpose of the

BLa is the same as that of the Tupamaros in Uruguay,

Frelimo in Mozambique, and all the other liberation forces:

The BIA is simply brothers and sisters who have gone

underground to put all the revolutionary rhetoric and

theory into practice.?. ."

Since May, 1971, the BLA has been involved in

armed confrontations with

law enforcement officials

resulting in eight police officers being killed and

another 28 being wounded or injured. Since July, 1971,

the BLA has been involved in excess of 20 known bank

robberies totaling over $494,000, which money is used to

finance its activities.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

• FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELE -DEFENSE

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George

Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black

people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of

the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther

Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called

"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the

use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program

to end the oppression of the black people but since early

1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

BEP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-

munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the

U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders

have since avolded extreme statements in favor of calling

for action within the established order. Newton, in an

interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"

magazine, stated the Panthers'

chief

ambition is to change

the American Government by any means necessary but that

ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,

indicators of the BPP's contimed attraction to violence persist.

Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested

In Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,

murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of

Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges and

is now a local tugitive. Additionally, one died and three

were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY

The Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) was reportedly

formed in the Summer of 1973, in California. An SLA

document captioned, "Declaration of Revolutionary War and

the Symbionese Program," dated 8/21/73, states

• . . Therefore,

we of the Symbionese Federation of the SIA. ... do now, by

the rights of our children and people and by force of arms

and with every drop of our blood, declare revolutionary war

against the fascist, capitalist class.

We support by

Force of arms the just struggles of all oppressed people

for self-determination and independence within the

United States and the world, and hereby offer to all

liberation movements, revolutionary

workers' groups and

peoples' organizations our total aid and support for the

struggle for treedom and justice for all people and races . . ."

The SLA has claimed credit for the 11/6/73 assassination of

DI. Marcus Foster, Oakland, California, School Superintendent;

the 2/4/74 kidnaping of Patricia Campbell Hearst, daughter

of newspaper publisher-owner Randolph A. Hearst; and the

4/15/74 robbery of the Hibernia Bank, San Francisco,

California, in the furtherance of its revolutionary

objectives.

Six members of the SIA were involved in a

shoot-out with the FBI and Los Angeles, California, police

on 5/17/74, resulting in their deaths.

Although no

current information has been developed indicating the

group has been active in areas other than California, other

groups and individuals have surfaced claiming adherence

to the SLA's revolutionary tenets.

The FBI collects and tabulates monthly and annual

statistics of selected crimes reported to law enforcement

agencies committed in the United States. The Uniform Crime

Reports (UCR) automated information systen provides support

in assembling and processing the crime statistics utilized

in the preparation and production of the UCR publications,

Including "Crime in the United States."

The AIDs, ICIC and UCR systens provide support

for the entire criminal justice community.

The Cryptanalysis Support Systen is a classified

and dedicated Automated Data Frocessing (ADP) system which

perforns mathematical and related calculations associated

with the FBI's cryptographic examination efforts.

The FBI, an agency of approximately 20,000 employees

and an annual budget of $468,700,000, utilizes ADP as an

administrative and management tool.

The FBI's payroll is

completely autonated. Fersonnel matters, such as pronation

end transfer, are managed through an on-line personnel data

systen. Ifforts are now underay to automate the FBI's

budget by implementing a nanagement information systen.

Several computer programs provide statistics required to

properly administer the FBI. All of these individual efforts

make up the Bureau Administrative Support Information Syston

The Investigative Support Information Systen is

composed of all ADP efforts which directly support the FBI's
