COMMUNIST INFILTRATION TAKING PLACE, BUT TO MAKE THESE CHARGES OF

CASTRO BEING A COMMUNIST AND ALL THAT IS JUST FANTASTIC. AND, WHAT HE

IS DOING IS HE IS JUST JUSTIFYING HIS TRIP. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF

SHENANIGANS IN THE AIR FORCE. HE, HIMSELF, WAS CONSIDERABLY INVOLVED

IN NEPOTISM. THE AIR FORCE WAS SITTING DUCKS FOR ANY ATTACK. ".

BARALT THEN ASKED " DO YOU REMEMBER THE STORY I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT

HIS HALF-BROTHER WHO IS A DISTANT RELATIVE OF MINE... HE IS THE BLACK

SHEEP OF THE FAMILY, AND IS CALLED

SERGIO DIAZ BRU /PHY, AND I MET

HIM IN WASHINGTON AND HE HAD TOLD ME THAT HIS BROTHER, "DIAZ LANZ WAS

BRINGING HIM INTO THE AIR FORCE, IN AN IMPORTANT POSITION THERE.

WHEN I HEARD THAT, I SAID MY GOD, THE AIR FORCE IS GOING TO POT,

BECAUSE THIS GUY, SERGIO DIAZ, COULD NOT EVEN GO TO HAVANA AS HE

WAS WANTED BY THE POLICE FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS.. NOT FOR POLITICAL

REASONS, BUT BECAUSE HE HAD CHISELED ABOUT ONE FIVE ZERO THOUSAND

SERGIO WAS SITTING IN WITH DIAZ LANZ IN THIS INTERNAL SECURITY HEARING.

SO, YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF A CHARACTER... ATWOOD THEN STATED

"I KNOW THE SITUATION THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE HELPED BY THIS TYPE

ÕF THING AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN HELP THINGS DOWN THERE IS TO GET

TO FIDEL AND CALM THINGS DOWN, AND THIS CAN BE DONE, BUT WHEN THINGS

LIKE THIS HAPPEN HE FLARES UP AND THIS GIVES AMMUNITION TO THOSE AROUND

HIM, WHO ARE TRYING TO PUSH HIM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. FORTUNATELY

PEOPLE HAVE NOT GIVEN UP DOWN THERE. OUR AMBASSADOR IS VERY GOOD

AND CIA CALLED ME ABOUT IT AND THEY ARE STILL WORKING TRYING TO DO

SOMETHING SENSIBLE. I HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME WITH CARLOS FRANQUI

TOO, WHOM I BELIEVE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL". ARALI ASKS IF ATWOOD SAW
