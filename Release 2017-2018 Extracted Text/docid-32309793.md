On July 26, 1963, a confidential informant,

who has

furnished reliable information in the past, advised that I.

that helintended to send a letter to Luis Somoza, former President

of Nicaragua, in which he intended to say the following:

(Somoza'S) many congressional friends in Washington, D. C. [5]

were distressed that, on his recent visit to the United States, they

did not have an opportunity to reciprocate the many kindnesses he

had rendered them personally and that a luncheon had been planned in

his honor in the Capitol for the purpose of rendering public thanks.

Davidson is personally distressed that for some reason

Somoza was not able to meet, officially, with the "First Fanily."'CS~

He intends also to say that if he, Davidson, had been afforded the

opportunity to meet with Somoza he could have arranged such a LS.

meeting for Somoza, informally, similar to a meeting which took GS_

place between former President Eisenhower and «Tachito." <5.

Davidson will tell Somoza that should he desire such a meeting CS]

during his next visit to the United States, he, Davidson, will

arrange it for him.

"Tachito" is a name commonly used in reference to

General Anastasio Somoza, brother of Luis Somoza and Head of<S.

Nicaraguan National Guard. S

Dayidson also intended to state that Morales could (S

confirm that Davidson was successful, after a

great deal of

difficulty, in preventing a leading international columnist from

writing about Sonoza's recent visit to Washington, D. C.

columnist, together with many other people in Washington, D.

felt that an ex-President and power in Latin America should not Cs]

have been subjected to the embarrassment of"slinking

Washington, D. C.

Davidson will ask Somoza to forget the unpleasantness (S

of his last visit to Washington and give Davidson a chance to

have Somoza's friends and the Government of the United States LS-

reciprocate to him for the great friendship he and the Nicaraguan] <S)

people have always shown the United States.

Davidson, in commenting on protocol, will indicate an

awareness of the fact that the Nicaraguan Ambassador to the United (S_

States must conduct affairs according to established protocol and

is ready to accept suggestions of the United States Department of

State on how to handle Somoza'S] visits to the United States. However, (S.

Davidson still wants to arrange an informal visit through his own

friends.

Davidson will also say that it is well known in Washington,

D. C., by Republicans, Democrats and the "Kennedys" that he supported

Vice President' Lyndon

Johnson and former Vice President Richard

Nixon in the last election and that he is also a close friend of

Jinmy Hoffa.

But because of his friends in all walks of life, he

enjoys a position of trust and friendship in Washington including

that of the present administration.

Davidson will conclude his letter by stating his confidence

that Somoza, knows he has the best interest of the Somoza family and (S-

[5) Nicaragua theart, and will ask that somoza not have a ready

ear forLy

He will also caution Somoza that there are tooLs

many jealous people around him who are too quick to criticize and

give gratuitous advice.

James R. Hoffa is president of the International Brother-

hood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen: and Helpers Union.
