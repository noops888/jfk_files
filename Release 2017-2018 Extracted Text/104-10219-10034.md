A Re Watts/Ben telecon, 10 Septenber

1974.

B) The meeting took place the morning

of 7 September 1974 in Miant.

telephoned Matt Maclane at his home on

7 September 1974 to pass on this informa

tion. The telecon was unsolicited by

MacVane, who no longer contacts Merola

per DCD Headquarters instructions.

Robinson flew in from Nassau to neet with

Joe Merola and Mike Yamants (Yamanis is

apparently from Ft. Lauderdale and like

Merola he has close ties to arms dealers

and mercenaries).

Robinson plans to meet

again with Merola and Yananis after com

plete financial details liave been worked

out in Nassau.
