SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS, WASHINGTON, D. Co, AND

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, NOVEMBER 20, 1971,

SPONSORED BY THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION

ACTION COALITION.....

This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in

Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build

public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a

conference held at Columbia University, New York City, in July, 1971, which

was attended by approximately 1, 000 women from 29 states. The conference

voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.

Subsequent to its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in

San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the

repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, and to call

for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington

Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the

Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the socialist workers Party

(SWP). Carol Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director

of the Washington march.

0.€

Coalition leaders in requesting permit for the demonstration have

jestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between

110, 000 and 20, 000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed

information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the

demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan

Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 5,000 persons

REC-23.

Demonstrators are scheduled to assemble at the Ellipse between

| a. a.m. and 12 noon and will march via 17th Street to H Street, down H Street

I to 15th Street, down 15th Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, and then easton

Pennsylvania Avenue to the west steps of the Capitol. A rally will be held

at the latter site between 2 and 6 p.m.

At the bottom of the letter was affixed a label

It is noted that November 20, 1971, is the date

of a publicly announced march and rally by the Woman's

Capitol. In a Washington Post Daily Newspaper article

of October 15, 1971, Dr. Barbar- Roberts, National Project

Director of the coalition stated that the march would

attack abortion laws which degraded, mutilated and murdered

women. She stated the coalition was comprised of about.

30 women's groups vaich roulú dc onstrate iguinut the forced

sterilization and restrictiva contraception laws and aiso

plan to hold national abortion hearings in Washington,

D.C., before the march. Roberts estimated between 10,000

and 20,000 women would engage in this march and rally.

On October 15, 1971, a source who has furnished

reliable information in the past advised that the November

20, 1971, WONAC March is largely the creator of the Young

mass demonstration activities on a local and

national level, and seeks to unite all women in

the fight for the right of abortion.

The Septembar 22, 1971, issue of the "Los Angeles Times";

RE: WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE OF MARYLAND

(TROTSKYIST)

1 nichides sitter

On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to

hold demonstrations at Washington, D. C. and San Francisco,

california on November 20, 1971.

The purpose of

demonstrations were to call for the repeal of all abortion,

contraception and forced sterilization laws.

The Women's.

Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland

affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing

arrangements for out-of-state women.

On November 22, 1971, a source advised that the

Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028

Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful

in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration

among Baltimore area women.

Therefore, the plan to charter

a bus for the purpose of transporting

, demonstrators to the

Washington, D. C. rally was cancelled.

On November 30, 1971, a second source advised

that the Women's Right to Choose of Maryland had been

formed as an

"ad hoc" group for the specific purpose of

supporting the November 20, 1971 Washington, D. C. demonstra-

tion. The source further staved tnau the Women's Right

to Choose of Maryland ceased to exist, following this

demonstration, and is now defunct.

Re :

Women's National Abortion Action

Coalition (WONAAC) Convention,

February 11 - 13, 1972

Boston, Massachusetts

On February 18, 1972, source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, furnished the following

information:

A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition

(WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,

Boston,

Massachusetts, during the period of February 11

13, 1972.

Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance

at this convention which was held to determine future action

Of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's

Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue.

Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (SP)

and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) fron all over the county

were requested by the national office of the SWP and YSA

to attend this convention in order to insure the effective

control of the convention by the SVP.

As the youth organization of the socialist

Workers

Party (SWP), the Young Socialist Alliance

(ISA) serves as the

main sourse of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described

in the masthead of its official

publication,

"The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A multi-

national revolutionary socialist youth organi-

zation,"

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

Re: WONAAC

Alientist

The SWP specifically wished the convention to

adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete

control of the fenale body

•by the individual female.

This specific issue,

"women control their bodies" was

adopted by the women's organizati on and all other propo

sals were rejected.

Workshops were organized for each of the many

separate racial and ethnis groups represented at the

conference. Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-

fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by

the SYP.

A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop

was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.

Among the issues discussed at

the workshop were the

attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-

dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard

to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups

all to often find themselves without a voice when real

issues are involved.

Of particular importance to the group vas the

La Raza Unida Party, a legitimate political party in Texas

which serves to unite Mexican Americans. Of equal impor-

tance was the Gay Liberation Movement, which the group

felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want

children and are forced to live with men because of the

mores of American society.

Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion

lav repeal will serve to unite women under one banner-and'...

more effectively serre the

"onen's

Hoverent.

The convention adjourned after an

agreement that

an "Abortion Action Week" would be held May 1 - 6, 1972.

This action would serve to keep public attention focused

on the need to legalize abortion and to seek effective

support from

the many thousands of women who want to right

to choose.

II. ACTIVITIES

A. Conferences and Demonstrations •

1. WONAAC Founding Conference was held in New York

City, New York, July 16-18, 1971.

This conference called for

An otton auto Col one an out the theme of ones

(WF I-1, 7/21/71)

a. On November 20, 1971, approximately 1,500 women,

representing womens liberation groups from the East

Coast and

Mid-West, gathered on the Ellidee in WDC, in resoonse to the

call by WONAAC to march on the United States Capitol to demand

the redeal of all abortion laws. This groud devarted the

Ellipse at approximately 10:30 a.m. on that date and marched

along Pensylvania Avende, MoV., to cue rest side of lie Capitol

Building. There the marchers assembled for a rally which

concluded at approximately 4:00 p.m. on the same date. There

were no incidents of violence and

the march and rally were

Deaceful throughout.

and the demonstration ended without incident.

(Physical observation, Special

Agents, FBI, 1/13/72)

2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,

Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300

women attended the conference, which once again re-established

and reiterated WONAAC's call

for abortion on demand.

It was

noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to

create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings

across the country had been disadpointingly small. It was

pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers

of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the

abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists

and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement

could not succeed without the support of the working women.

At the close of the conference, WONAAC strongly endorsed

the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," which is to be introduced in

the U. S. Congress by Congresswoman BELLA ABZUG from New York.

This bill would override all laws which impose sanctions upon'

those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.

(WE I-1, 2/14/72)

a. Proposed Actions

It was moved and adopted during the above conference

that WONAAC sponsor a week of local abortion activities, May: 1-6,

1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative support,

judicial action, and culminating in local or regional demonstra-

tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for redeal of all anti-

abortion laws and restrictive contraception

laws and an end to

forced

sterilization.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72)

In addition, the following secondary pronosals were

adopted during the conference:

1. That a telegram be sent to the New York

State Court of Appeals and New York Governor

NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER, condemning the court's

February 10, 1972, decision denying women on

Medicaid

the right to abortions on demand.

2. That the coalition continue to organize black,

Puerto Rican, Chicano, native American and Asian

American participation in their activities.

3. That members of local coalitions confront

candidates for office and force them to take a

stand on abortion, and that they publicize those

who oppose abortion so that the voters can see

where

• these politicians stand.

4. That the coalition make a special effort to

reach out to and involve "gay" women in their

activitles.

(WF I-1, 2/14/72)

YSA and SWP members of WONAAC felt the conference to

be a success in that opposition proposals submitted were turned

down in favor of those proposals backed by the YSA-SWP women.

Washington Field.

The State University of New York at Binghamton

is part of the University system of the State of New York,

and the University at Binghamton has an enrollment of

approximately 7,500

students.

The student newspaper

published at the University twice weekly during

the school

year in its issue of 10/15/71 carried a brief ad in the

classified section as follows:

1HW 550842

"Women who have had abortions needed to relate

their experiences to other women, educate all women

about abortion at abortion speak out October 21. Contact

Linda I., extention 4130. "

The 11/12/71, issue of the "Pipedream", student

newspaper published at the State University of New York

at Binghamton, carries an announcement that the Binghamton

Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets. for the

Womens March on Washington for repeal of all abortion laws,

repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization

for 11/20/71. Women and men were invited to attend and

tickets were on sale at the student center. Cars and

volunteers were needed and they were to contact LINDA LOEW

at extention 4129.

Former AT 3487-pST, who is familiar with New

Left activities on the campus of the State University of

New York at Binghamton was contacted regularly during the

school year of 1971-72 and he stated that he did see

some signs on bulletin boards in the Fall of 1971 about

abortion organizations, but never knew them to be of much

success on campus.

of approximately January, 1972 until school closed in

May, 1972.

This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated

also at that time that LINDA LOEW has been a close

associate of BETTY SACHS who is the leader of the loung

Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.

Informant stated that there was no organization formed

his knowledge of a Womens Abortion Action Coalition in

the Binghamton area.

Other sources familiar with New Left activities

on the campus of the State University of New York at

Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two

sources advised that they knew of no organization of

Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the

Binghamton vicinity during the past year.

Albany Division has had an investigation pending

On LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate

recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.

In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition

organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation

is being conducted by Albany.

I. ORGANIZATION

A.

Origin and Objectives

The Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition

(BOWAAC), the local affiliate of the Women's National

Abortion

Action Coalition (FONiAC), was formed during

late sumner, 1971, out of the local Female Liberation

(FL) group.

BS T=1

November 17, 1971

BONAAC was originally a subcoumittee of FL

in the Greater Boston Area but as of Jenuary, 1972, had

grown into a separete group whose specific interest was

in abortion reform. Individuals active in BOWAAC are

also active in other FL work; however, all individuals

active in FI work are not active in BOWAAC, with BOWAAC

being the smaller of the two groups.

9S I-].

JaDuary 12, 1972

WONAAC has been publicly described

as an organization of groups whose

2 im

is to effect the ovarthrow of existing

abortion laws and to ectablish free

abortion on demand.

UTTER OF SUBJECT ORGANIZATON

The YSA and SWP in the Boston area have approxi

with approximately six to eight in and this controllfug forces

Of BOWLAC. As of January, 1972, JANE ROLÄND, who joined

the Boston SWP in late 1971, was heading up SWP/YSA work in

FL and BONAAC aS MATILDE MILES had not returned to Boston,

but rather transferred to New York.

January 12, 1972

In late January, 1912, TOBA SINGER'and JANE

ROLAND, leaders of the local SWE/YSA FL faction, reported

that there wes continuing trouble within it with respect

"to the control of that group by the SHP aud iSA forces

During carly March, 1972, TOBA SINGER Icported

that at an incressing rate abortion work was becoming a

more important area of work than Fl. and that a

number of SWP and YSA female members were being trans

ferred into the abortion work.

March 26, 1972

The stress of the SHP/YSA Eomalo members in the

general Boston area who are active in female matters con-

tinues to be away from FL and into BOWAAC with only two

or thrce remaining on the fringes to follow EL activities.

BS T-1

May 10, 1972

Recent reports concerning SWP/YSA faction work

within BOWAAC disclose that, as previously occured with

the Panty's work within Fl,

those in the Party faction

have apparently alionated themselves from the other

femalas active in BOUAC and for the most part hove lost

any support fron others not in the Party fiction.

Any

suggestions now offered by those of the Prity faction in :....

BOWWAC, which comprises approximately half of the activists

in the group, are no longer acceptad, cause considorable

argument and there is evidence of "red baiting"

AS a

result, the Farty faction does not now believe that they

can - build

_ BOWAAC into any successful supporter type

organization as had resulted through Party work in the

Student Mobilization Comnittee (SMC).

The "Boston Globe"

, a daily newspaper published

in Boston, in its February 13, 1972 edition, carried an

article entitled "Abortion Strategy Discussed" which in

part reported that more than 800 women from acsoss the

country had gathered for a conference at Boston University

the weekend of February 11~13, 1972 to plan a strategy

to win repeal of all laws that prohibit abortion.

Accord-

ing to the article, it was expected that the conference

would endorse the latest Federal bill to nullify all

state laws restricting abortion • "The Abortion Rights

AcE of 1912"

, to be introduced by United States Congress-

TOman BELLA ABZUG from New York.

The article reported

that discussion at the conference had centered around

whether or not to adopt the slogan "Free Abortion on

Demand; no Forced Sterilization

of to focus on a

single issue - repeal of the abortion laws. It further

reported that & proposal was presented for an Abortion

Action Week, May 1 to 6, 1972, to include educational pro

grams.

legislative support, judicial action and local or

regional demonstrations centering around the demand for

repeal

ot all anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws

and an end to forced sterilization.

JANE ROLAND, identified in the article as

coordinator of BOWNAC, was reported to have stated that

whatever the conference does nationally her organization

would be acting at the local level.

The February 13, 1972, scscion of the WOMAC

Conference at Boston University was in the form of

workchops held in approximately eight clasoroons with

about 50 females in attendance at each workshop. The

maximum number of persons present at any one time dur

..ing the day would be estimated at between 400 to 500.

The workshops primarily related to the building of WONAAC

throughout the United States, fund raising and regional

work, with ideas being exchanged between individuals

attending from various areas of the country, including

Boston.

The major theme appeared to be how to strengthen

awarEness of WONAAC, which was reportedly in need of

financial support.

Litecature tables were see up un the

periphery of the workshops and among organizations ider-

tified with the tables was the YSA..

YOU CANNOT HAVE

WARS WITHOUT

WOMEN

Women must use their minds, their voices, and

their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do

less is to ignore our special responsibilities to

the human race.

"10, 000 women have sat back and let their sons

be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10, 000 women

willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop

the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-

out women. "

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against

World War I. She has consistently maintained

her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura-

geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all

women.

The presence of the United States forces in the ini

ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.

There can be no possible justification for our inte

ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant

land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wil

ing to stay in jail until the bombing is stopped.

N

all women are free to join her, but we can assure

her that thousands of women will march peacefull

beside her. Some will picket, others will go to ja

with Miss Rankin. Every woman's participation i

equally valuable. We are confident each one will

the maximum of which she is capable.

On January 8th, women from all over the land wil

converge on Washington to demand the end of this

dishonorable war. We shall come as individuals,

or as organizations, but we shall join together as

concerned women under the aegis of Jeannette Rai

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS

Helena, Montana

November 27, 1967

To all American Women:

I

ain proud of the fact that my first

vote cast in Congress was a vote

against war.

It was the first oppor-

unity for a woman to vote, because I

was the first woman to be

elected to

Congress.

I believed then, as I do today,

that women are the

ones

that must be

concerned with the needs and develop-

ment of the human race.

I have always

fought for the dignity of all human

beings - for those of the present

as

INFORMATION CONCERNING

INTERNAL SECURITY

The following Information has been made avallable

by sources who have furnished reliable Information In the

past:

Source One reported on December T, 1967, that copies

of "Ia Wisp"

, monthly newsletter of the Southern California

Council of the Women Strike for Peace (WSP - see appendix)

being mailed to the WSP mailing list on that date contained

a "Call" from the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) "To all

American women"

, announcing a proposed march on Washington,

D. C.3

on January 8, 1968, when the United States Congress

opens in joint session.

This march would be to demand that

Congress, as Its first order of business, resolve to end

• the war in Vietnam and Immediately arrange for the mith-

drawal of all American troops. (A xerox duplication of

first page of the above-mentioned December 1967 issue of

"Ia Wisp

containing this

"Call", is appended to this

memorandum.)

Issue of the "La Wisp"lIst of JRB sponsors included in this

", contained the names of only two

women presently active in the Southern California area,

Mary Clarke (see characterization of her in the appendix

page on WSP.), and motion picture actress leslie Parrish.

Source One has advised that Parrish has only

recently become interested in ectivities.of WSP and has

attended less than five WSP activities.

a member in good standing with the Screen Actors Guild,

Hollywood, her dues being paid through May 1, 1968.

According to source one, the southern California

Council of WSP Is presently coordinating local activity to

form a contingent of the JRB from Southern California.

They

are making office space and telephones in their Los Angeles

headquarters, 5899 West Piço Boulevard, Los Angeles available

for this purpose. Spearheading the local committee are

Mary Clarke and Eva Korn, both of whom are active in WsP.

Mary Clarke is currently

a member of the JRE's National Steer-

Source Three reported during November 1947, that

Eva Korn was a member of the Los Angeles County

Communist Party (ASCCP) during the years 1946

and 1947.

To give publicity to the proposed activity of the

JRB, the local WSP office is circulating a reprint from the

"San Francisco Chronicle"

opposition to wars by former Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin,

Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who

volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that

they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail

for the commission of civil disobedience while in Washington,

Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit

women to join the Brigade would be, to make a pitch for

recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagmar Wilson and Ruth/Krause

are naking their respective speaking engagements across the

United States since their return from a trip to North Vietnam,

which they visited as representatives of WSP during the

fall of 1967.

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965

that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,

Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967

"peace conference" in Helsinki, Finland, at the

Invitation of the Communist Party (CP),

and that

funds to cover her expenses were raised in part

by the CP; and that following her attendance at

the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten

days at the invitation and expense of the soviet

Government.

Source One learned that a communication was re-

ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,

Indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not

be

held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until

either the 15th or 22nd of January 1958, depending upon

the date that the United States. Congress would reconvene.

The communication indicated that since the entire purpose

of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session

of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march

prior to the date Congress would reconvene. The suggestion

was made that recruitment of local women to participate in

the JRB be held in abeyance until a conficnation had been

obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.

Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in Seattle, April 25, 1962,.

at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominated to be the new Chairman of

this. Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN

said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP;

an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven

members. She said four of the seven were from the "left" but

did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an

organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she

could help.

On April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of

the University CP Club was held at seattle on April 2, 1963.

KEN ROSE, a member of the Club, reported the most influential

peace organization in Seattle was SWAP.

on July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP

Section Committee was

held

at seattle, WILL PARRY, Section

Chairman, said attention should be placed on three political

questions - peace, civil rights, and labor..

Under peace, he

said CP clubs should inject the Women Act for Peace campaign

into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,

February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective

peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace

Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting

SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.

A third source advised on February 24, 1966; a

Northwest District CP Committee meeting was held at Seattle

February 12, 1966. After lunch, the entire group participated

in passing out leaflets pertaining to racial matters and the

Vietnam war which carried the name. of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna. Avenue

Northeast, Seattle, Washington. 98105, which address has been

used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI KOPPEL, also known

as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL.

KOPPEL has been and continues to be

the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP

as of May, 1967.

A fourth source reported in 1945

ANCI KOPPEL was a member of the

Professional Group of the Communist

Political Association (CPA), also

known as the Rogers CP Club at

Seattle, Washington.

The CPA has been designated by the

Attorney General of the United States

pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

W.E.B. DU BOIS CLUES OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source advised that on October 26-27, 1953

Ference of members of the Connunist Party, USA (CRUSA), including

national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose

of

setting in motion Ionces for the establishment of anew national

Marxist -oriented youth organization inich would hunt for the most

peaceful transition to socialism.

The delegates were told that it

would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted

into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP

itself.

A second source has advised that the fuunding convention

for the new youth organization was held from June I911, 1964,

at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, Call/denie, at which

time the name W.E.B.DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.

Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States

attended this convention.

The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIKE

ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities

the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist

centers and to solidify the Party base through the DCA..

This

scurce also advised in Sepiomber, 1966 that DANCEL RUBIN, CPUSA

National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes

the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organiz-

ation favorable to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism,

and in April, 1967, advised GUS HALL, CPUSA General Secretary,

had indicated the CA primary emphasis should be on developing

mass resistance to the draft.

:

the Third National Convention of the DCA held

York, from September 8-10, 1967.

A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that JARVIS

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the ppening

and our meetings with those of you whom we have seen recently have been brief.

Of course, we know the paralysing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,

as we learn of the mounting horrors in Victnam. But this feeling is only

temporary, and quickly gives way to activity.

responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movemente

for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising lunds

to send representatives to lashington. We hope that you will also support this

effort, to insure representation from Portland Women for Peace.

To all American Women:.

November 27, 1967:

GOMRIDENTIAL

ar proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress was a vote against war.

It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote; because I was the first woman.

to be clected to Congress.

I believed then, as I do today,

that women are the ones that must be concerned

with the needs, and, development of the human race. I have always fought for the

dignity of all human boings - for those of the présent as vell as those of future

generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all women will respond to

the following.cal and join me in Washington on January l5 1968, the opening day

of Congress:

• November 27, 1967:

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congross was a vote against war.

It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote, because I, was the first woman

to be elected to Congress.

I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that must be concerned

with the needs, and, development of the human race. I have always fought for the

dignity of all human beings - for those of the prosent as well as those of future

generations. •

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to

intention had been to have only those women participate

in the JRB who were willing to risk arrest for civil disobedience,

she stated at the above meeting that no civil disobedience is

anticipated in view of the large number of organizations

participating who are opposed to

such civil disobedience.

However, she further stated that individuals are not going to

be discouraged who might elect

to create civil disobedience.

Decision to participate jointly on any given

suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the co-.

ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other

peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee

meetings and general. meetings, as warranted, are open to

all and announced in mailings to members. There are no

dues or membership forms nor conditions

for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Homen For

Illinois, (now deceased) made available in January, 1954,

the

"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated publication which

stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship

(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943.

This document stated,

"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of

American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,

The present name was adopted to conform to standard

It should be noted, however, that the

Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its

affairs rests exclusively in the hands

of its Chicago Executive

Board."

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to

the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would

be known as the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Relations

(CCASR) • MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of

the new organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that

MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,

assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,

and

was maintaining existing records of the organization at

his residence, 660 West Irving Païk Road, Chicago, Illinois.

The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be

to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.

While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program

followed the NCASE and it was in frequent contact with the

NCASF.

On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in

the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the

Communist Party (CP) of Illinois.

TERMAN was in Russia in

November, 1958, where he had gone

to discuss the treatment of

Jews and to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the

leadership of the Soviet Union.

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -- for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

It is time forewomen to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-

on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1. CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE

WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL

OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.

presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7

to New York, 1/12/12; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,

2/28/73.

As outlined in referenced New York letter, the

New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it

C

recognized that, although several leaders of WONAAC were

known to be SWP members,

their activities, as pertaining to

'ONAAC, had been directed tord the legal

repeal of all

restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed

no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in

any subversive or vidence

prone activity.

Referenced Bureau O-7, referencing the aforementioned

communication, nevertheless instructed that the New Yok Office,

as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned

organization, and directed the New York Office to reopen its

case and submit semi-annual reports.

A review of the results of the continuing investigation

Of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining

thereto, since June 1912, reflects no apparent change in the

activities or the organization a its membership from that

outlined above.

The New York Office is in accord with the view of the

Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,

that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle which,

despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,

deals with the single issue of abortion rights

Re:

National Women's Political Caucus (NNPC)

Policy Council Meeting

Source, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, provided the following information on July 3, 1972:

A Policy Council Meeting of the National Women's

Political Caucus

(NWIC) was held in Washinaton, D.C. during

the period June 24, 1972 - June 25, 1972.

The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open

organization of politically motivated women

seeking equal recognition

in the American

community.

During the Policy Council Meeting there were no

overt attempts by any organized aroup to influence the policy

meeting and there were no individuals present who identified

themselves as members of any organization which might be construed

as subversive and/oi supporting any cause except legitimate

change.

significance, however, was the fact that literature

of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) was

present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the meeting

area.

All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion

movement and specifically the WONAAC conference scheduled for

Hunter College, New York, July 15 - 16, 1972..

WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of

formina a national movement of groups scatterea

throughout the United States who favor and

now work to legalize abortion.

The Young Socialist

Alliance (YSA) and Socialist Forkers Party (SWP)

are playing a major role in moNade.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

Rẹ: NVPC Policy Council Meeting

As the youth organization of the SWP, the

YSA serves

as the main source of recruitment into

that organization.

The YSA is described in the

masthead of its official publication, "The Young

Socialist Organizer:"

as

"a multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

During the council meeting on June 24, 1972, Mary

Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California WPC,

an affiliate of the NWPC; advised a group of policy council

members that WONAAC had been using the Southern California PC

name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that MONAAC

had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California and

vere very effective at taking control of small gatherings:

The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose

name was not recalled, defended WONAAC stating that "they were

a good group"

This woman's position was not

supported and,

in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted or those persons

present.

Jill ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy

Council,

is reportedly concerned about the SWP's

attempts

to align

itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly

gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local

The NWPC organizing brochure suhlished by the NIPC

has been written to assist individual MPC groups in organizing.

The brochure lists political parties and para-political

organizations to be contacted br caucus organizers when forming

the nucleus of a PC. Among those listed was the SWP. After

discussions at the caucus it was determined that the swp should

be removed from the dist.

The new edition of the MPC organizing

brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replacea by National

Peace Action Coalition (NºAC) .

The NPAC was

founded in 1970 by members of the Sup.

Its basic objective is to unite masses of people

including labor unions, CIs, and the black

community in the struggle to end United States

intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and

peaceful tactics.

The Women's National Abortion

Action Coalition

Confidential sources one, two and three, all of

whom have furnished reliable information in the past, advised

on July 1o, 19, and 20, 1972, respectively, that a Women's

National Abortion Action Coalition IONAIC, Conference was

held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 09th Street, on

July 15 and 16, 1972.

Confidential source number one advised that

New York City was picked for the site of this convention

because this city is considered to be the center of the most

powerful anti-abortion effort so far.

The WONAAC Conference was open to all women

who supported the Abortion Law Repeal Movement.

Registration

was $3.00 per person.

Housing and chila care facilities were

avallable.

There were approximately 800 women in attendance

at this conference.

Discussions held at this conference centered on

plans for (one) future activity in the campäign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (twoto end

forced sterilization.

A discussion was held concerning the attacks

being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other

anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their

own bodies.

WONAAC is aware of the fact that progress for

these matters will not come easy, that it will be fought by

various groups step by step all the way, therefore, this

conference was called to discuss all the different approaches

and to decide on the major direction for wONAAC to take..

In ai swer to Rose Weber's

on July 15, 1972, a proposal waspassedby the

Election Workshop which stated in parü as follows:

"WOWAAC welcomes womon fron all political

"By uniting women of all poliilcal views we

maximize our strength.

Any attompt to impose one political

view on everyone in. HONAAC would only destroy our abiltuy to

Therefore HONAAG,

as an organization tales no position on any candidates or

"The political callles which will no doubt take

place with increaiing frequency around the country as

November approaches offer us a forum for getting our ideas

across to great numbers of women.

Besides ellowing us an

opportunity to force the candidates to take a public stand

on abortion, these gacherings give us a chance to publicize

both WONAAC and the

A National VOMIC structure proposal was

presented, which stated in part as follows:

"All women are welcone in HONANC: Black,

Ladina, Chicana, lutive Mericon and Astan women, Eay

women, high echosl, college, and corking women, women

from politicul organizations, trade unions, the militarys

We are united in un-

compromising struegle for our conmon goal: the

right of

all women to control. fully their ou reproductive lives..."

"The National Conference shall be the highest

decision making body of WOMAC, and shall operate on ühe

basis of one woman, one vote.

"There shall be a National Coordinating Committee

(NCc) composed of one woman from each national organization,

coalition, And group supporting and building HOnAAC...

There shall also be a Working Commitee (W),

In addition to the

above, a proposal "that the

coalition establish an emergency cash fund, from which to

contribute significant amounts of money to organizations

working to achieve goals compatible

with those of WONAAC...

"That the National Office of WONAC, as Its firot

act of financial supports pledge $2,000 to the Kennedy Schulder

suit against the tax-exempt status of the Roman Catholle Church,

since the Church has violated restrictions on its political

"That the National Office of WONAAC pledged

$1,500 to the defense of the seven women arrested in

chicago because of their alleged activity in abortion

counselling,

referral, and prodedure..

"That the WONAAC National Office maintain,"

at all times,

& fund-raising staff efficient enough

to meet the needs of the emergency fund at the same

time 1t raises sufficient capital to maintain the daily

expenses of the National Office and staff...

Confidential sousce number two related that the

evening plenary session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,

and it was immediately apparent that the Socialist

Workers Party - Young Socialist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group

dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make

statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor

leaders and these same

persons continued to vote as a bloc

on all issues.

The group of Independent women fron various geogra-

phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the

SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was adjourned

and considered the problem of. how to handle the SwP leaders.

While these women were not political realists in their goals,

they did believe In working throughout the existing system

rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal

of revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists would

no longer continue hassing within WONAAC.

They did not want

to have decisions for them being structured by a male dominated

group. They also decided that money being collected by WONAAC

in the name of abortion law change was not being used

for that

purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was

labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal

Hassles.

About 35

Independents attended

and a few number of SWP-YSA members and

sympathizers were present.

Independents

there were from New

Haven, Boston,.

Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and

San Francisco.

There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance.

at the afternoon session. According to one of the SWP

leaders, these women were from 31 states and three countries-

Italy and Sweden.

Chan others were Ohio, Illinois, New fork, and liassachusetts.

The states that had more representation

Most of the probiems and differences between the

independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion

law reform.

The SwP was charged with always having demonstra-

tions and

rallies and

never doing any work through the legis

lative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of this

hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways

to change abortion laws than carrying placards in the streets.

After the independent women publicly resigned in

front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced

they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's

name is unknown.

Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent

women to reconsider. The removal of the Independents from WONAAC

has debilitated the organization and most independent representa-

tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion

law change in organizations which have no connection with the

SWP.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC Will

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

there is also the concern that women new to the movement will

join in a mistaken notion that they will be furthering

abortion

law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving New York that

they would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an

effort to prevent this.

As the youth organization of the socialist

Workers Party (SWP), the YSA serves as the

main source of recruitment into that organ

The YSA is described in the masthead

they intended to utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut

PH T-l added that this

change was made inasmuch as the name WAR was found to be unwieldy

and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with

WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC.

An article in "The Sunday Bulletin," Section 2, pages

6 and 7, issue of October 31, 1971, listed the various candidates

abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the

The discussions held on the abortion

rights issue indicated

that the SWP felt that the capitalistic

system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation

to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic

system being promoted by the SWP would be in favor of abortion and

women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract

The Young Socialist Alliance-Twin Cities

Group is the Youth Branch of the Twin Cities

Branch-Socialist Workers Party (ICB-SWp), an

affiliate of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).

As the youth organization of the Socialist

Workers Party (SVP), the Young Socialist Alliance

(YSA) serves as the main source of recruitment

into that organization.

The YSA is described in

the masthead of its official publication,

"The

Young Socialist Organizer, " as "A multinational

revolutionary socialist youth organization."

The MYAAC rally held May 6, 1972, began at the

residence of the governor of the State of Minnesota,

1006

Summit Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota, at approximately 3:30P.M.

and proceeded to the State Capitol

Building where the rally

calling for the repeal of all abortion laws and emphasizing

the demand for the right to legal abortions was held. The

rally was held without incident and speakers identified

included representatives from the YSA-TCG and the TCB-SWP.

Jane Van Deusen was the principle speaker for the MWAAC

at this rally which ended at approximately 5:30 P.M.

MP T-1 on

May 9, 1972

The principle speaker in favor of legal abortion

in the State of Minnesota at the rally held in St. Paul,

Minnesota, on May 6, 1972, was Jane Van Deusen from Minne-

The MWAAC held a meeting July 25, 1972, at 100

decided that an International Tribunal was planned for

October 21, 1972. The International Tribunal would be

held in New York City, New York, and it was hoped that

plans could be made for a local tribunal scheduled to be

held October 13, 1972, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after

which individuals would be designated

to attend the inter-

national meeting scheduled for New York City. This July,

1972, meeting

was the first activity on the part of the

MWAAC as aner-organized effort following the May 6, 1972,

rally...

MP T-1 on

August 9, 1972

Individuals known to be involved in the women's

liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis

and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,

shown little or no interest in the organization known as the

MWAAC.

Former leaders in the women's liberation movement

have become aware of the SWP influence among the leaders of

the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active

participation in the affairs of this group. While the

May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by

some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be

due to individual interest in the abortion issue.

MP T-2 on

August 17, 1972

SWP INFLUENCE

The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor

is it a part of the YSA-TCG. Women's liberation is a topic

of general interest and concern to the membership of the

TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is

one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued

interest.

Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, expressed

interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of

policy.

The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion

movement, is one aspect of this women's liberatión movement

which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,

both male and female.

While the vast majority of women in

the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes

in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal

or change also include professional women, medical doctors,

lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all

walks of life..

in New York City (NYC), details of which will be set out

more fully hereinafter.

As the youth organization of the

swe, the IsA serves as the main

source of recruitment into that

organization.

The YSA is described

in the masthead of its official

publication, "The Young Socialist

Organizer", as "a Multi-National

Revolutionary Socialist Youth

Organization".

The SWP has been designated pur-

suant to Executive Order 10450.

I. ORGANIZATIONAL DATA

A. Origin and Scope

NY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY I-3 on October 1,

1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in

conference at Columbia University, NYC, NY, on July 16;

1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement

of independent groups scattered throughout the United

States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.

As a result of this conference, WONAAC was foundea.

B. Aims and Purposes

In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,

1971, WONAAC was self-described as a nationally coordina-

ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation;

legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations

in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,

demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all

restrictive contraception laws.

WONAC claims to reach

all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;

native American women; campus women; gay women; high

school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and

working women; young women; women from churches, political

organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities

C. Headquarters

On November 22, 1972, a Special Agent (SA) of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), utilizing a

pretext, contacted an individual self-identified as CAROL

EATON at telephone number 675-9150, located at 150 5th

Avenue, NYC, NY.

EATON, who stated she is currently a

National Staff member of WONAAC, advised that the National

and NY Staffs of WONAAC are headquartered at this address:

D. When Meetings Held

According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition

meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening

at Religious Center at New York University, 2 Washington

Square North, NYC, NY. EATON stated that most NY State

staff members are

present at these meetings and at least

one or more National Staff members also try to be in

attendance.

Other than this, state and national staffs

meet periodically, as business demands.

E. Officers

EATON identified the following individuals as

current officers of WONAAC:

SUSAN LAMONT

MARILYN MARKUS

## Page 447

NY 100-174481

F.

Membership and Finances

According to EATON, WONAAC does not maintain a

formal membership, as such,

and financially exists only

through voluntary contributions.

She stated that all

staff members, National and NY State, serve on a voluntary

basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance

allowance" which the staff has found necessary to supplement

with their own personal funds in order to get by.

G.

WONAAC Affiliates

CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC

affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the US, and

that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate

or coalition.

II. YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL

OVER WONAAC

NY I-1 provided information on July 22, 1971,

that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was

held at Columbia University, NYC, NŸ, from July 16, 1971,

to July 18, 1971, which resulted in the founding of WONAAC.

NY I-I stated that it was immediately apparent that this

conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members

who infiltrated the various conference committees and

workshops which were established to help formulate the

main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.

NY I-l stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,

in the future, dictate policy for this organization and

would be able

to control the utilization of WONAAC funds.

On August 5, 1971, NY I-4 provided a leaflet

captioned, "What Every Woman

Should Know". This leaflet,

which was published by feminist Organization for Communi-

cation; Action and Service (F.O.C.A.S.), related the following:

"The

Womens National Abortion Coalition has

been called and organized by the SWP and its affiliate,

the YSA, including women supposedly representing Women's

Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

HH 55088 DocId:32989545 Page 447

---

## Page 448

NY 100-174481

SWP and YSA.

These women attach more importance to their

political movement than to the Women's Liberation Movement.

And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform

of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political:

party to build itself on. The SWP/YSA realizes this and

is taking advantage of it."

On August 5; 1971, a leaflet

captioned "F.0.C.A.S." revealed

in part as follows:

"A nucleus of about eight feminists

have formed FOCAS, Feminist

Organization for Communication,

Action and Service.

FOCAS evolved

from the Women's Strike Coalition

(WSC), which the Socialist Workers

Party abruptly abandoned on may

25th in order to form the committee

fOr WONAAC.

Since that time a

nucleus of women from WSC together

with like-minded feminists pre-

served the WSC in order to main

tain and expand a multi-issue

action-oriented Women's Libera-

tion coalition in the NYC area.

Assisted by loans from supporting

feminists, the new WSC paid

back nearly a thousand of the

three thousand dollars of debts

incurred by the SWP women who

had controlled the old wSC.

The "Militant" issue of August 6, 1971, page five,

in an article entitled, "Abortion Campaign Counters Red-

Baiting", revealed in part, with respect to the founding

WONAAC conference in July, 1971:

"The Militant" is a weekly news-

paper of the SWP.

5

55088 DocId: 32989545 Page 448

## Page 449

NY 100-174481

"There were many members of the SWP and YSA at the

conference, and SWers and YSAers are among those who

have worked most consistently for abortion repeal and to

build the abortion conference...."

NY I-5 advised on November 12, 1971, that a NY

Planning Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOEB Student Center,

NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans

for a scheduled November 20, 1971

demonstration in Washington,

DC.

According to this source, this meeting was completely

dominated and controlled by members of the SWP.

NY T-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper

West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a

contingent

of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971,

in order to participate in the planned demonstration there

on that date. •

NY I-6 stated that practically all the members of the

uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate

in this activity.

NY I-5 related

on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled

November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "crucial" to

all SWP and YSA branches in that it afforded an opportunity

for selling of "The Militant" and other SWP/YSA literature,

and also afforded an opportunity for "intervening " in the

action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.

NY I-8 on February 11, 1972, and NY I-9 and NY T-10

on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC

convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,

The general theme of this convention was

Abortion Law Repeal". NY I-8 stated that approximately

30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were observed.

in attendance at this convention.

NY I-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the

de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON Administration,

the YSA-New York Local (NYL), while continuing on with

anti-war work through the NY

Student Mobilization

NY 100÷174481

Committee (SMC) and NY National Peace Action Coalition

(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would

also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation

Movement through their influence in WONAAC:

The SMC is controlled by the

SWP and its youth affiliate,

YSA. SMC initiates and supports

public demonstrations against

the war in Southeast Asia.

NPAC was founded in 1970 by

members of the SWP.

Its objec-

tive is the immediate, total

and unconditional withdrawal

of all US forces and material

in Southeast Asia.

NY T-T advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,

through October 17, 1972, that activities of WONAAC were

dutifully reported

and included on the agenda at regular

meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local

(NYL) during that period.

NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-

ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP.

NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC

meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,

starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though

WONAAC previously had accused various female activists

working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle

of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against

the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they

are forced to work with these individuals to helo strengthen

the WONAAC cause.

At this meeting, certain WONAAC Staff members

walked out and voiced their aisapproval of the meetinc

being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.

They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a

policy-making position in WONAAC.

NY T-7 on July 18, 1972, and NY I-ll on July 19,

1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was

held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on

July 15, 1972 and July 16, 1972.

NY T-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of

this convention because this city is considered to be

the center of the most powerful anti-abortion effort so far.

plans for (one) -future activity in the campaign to repeal

all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two)-to

end forced sterilization.

A discussion was held concerning the attacks

being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other

anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own

bodies:

NY I-ll related that the evening plenary session

Of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately

apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.

Independent women who wanted to make statements during

this session were voted down by SWP 'floor leaders and

these same persons continued to vote as a block on all

Issues.

The group of independent women from various

geographic areas, that is, those women who were not

associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the

plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem

of how to handle the SWP leaders.

While these women

were not political realists in their goals, they did

believe in working throughout the existing system rather

than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of

revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists

would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They

did not want to have decisions for them being structured

by a male dominated group.

They also decided that money

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather

to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

SUB)LUE C,

About 35

independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members

and sympathizers were present. Independents there were

from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NY), Chicago,

Philadelphia,

and San Francisco.

The independents did not waiver in their firm

opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national

coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided to

resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session.

They

also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-

ment through the various publications.

4/- The six national coordinators who resigned were

JUDY SIPHERS, San Francisco; ANN C DAVIDSON, Philadelphia;

ROSE WEBER, NY; VICKI ESLINGER, Columbia, South Carolina;

NANCYX ROLF, NX; and ELLENASHAPIRO, NY.

There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-

dance at the afternoon session.

According to one of the

SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three

countries-Canada, Italy and Sweden.

The states that had

more representation than others were Ohio, Illinois, New

York and Massachusetts.

Most of the problems and differences between the

independents and the SWP centered around approaches to

abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always

having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any

work through the legislative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of

this hassle and that they believed there were more ef-

fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards

in the streets.

MANDER OF SUBJECI CROAZUZACION

LINDA JENNESS made a final plea for the indepen-

dent women to reconsider.

The removal of the independents

from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most

independent, representatives will be going back to their

own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations

which have no connection with the swe.

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will

be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform

and there is also the concern that women new to the move-

ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be

furthering abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving NY that they

would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an

effort to prevent this.

III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL

STAFF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE

When contacted under pretext on November 24,

1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National

Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,

related that she has been

related that stews be avert in now de since y not a

YSA, SWP, or member of any "radical group",

acknowledged

there always have been SWP, YSA and "radical" elements

in WONAAC.

She went on to state, however, that WONAAC

has never allied itself politically with any organization

or individual, including any of the political candidates

in the recent political election and, despite its diverse

makeup as too ideological beliefs of its membership,

WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only

to the objectives for which it was originally founded.

To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from

whatever source offered.

NY 100-174481

EATON admitted there were some problems in

the past with regard to friction within WONAAC about SWP

YSA influence.

She stated, however, this matter, to

ner observation, never seemed a serious one,

and is quite

minimal today.

With regard to the "walk out" of six

national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,

she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because:

of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because

those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a "referral

agency"*

callers to a specific location or place where abortions

could be obtained:

IV. PLANNED PROJECTS.

CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-

national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, Ny, from March 9,

1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been

finalized, including the exact location or site this event

will take place.

However, she noted that SIMONE, BEAUVOIR,

a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberation Movement,

would be honorary chairwoman.

The Wonen's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC)

the subject of a separate investigation by the Bureau

in numerous offices. In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed

out that WONAAC represents a kasic Social change desling with

abortion rights and that in view of the fact the U.S. Suprene

Court upheld the right of abortion, the continued investigation

Di WONAAC at this tine does not appear to be desirable and

should ba discontinued. Pniladelphia also suggested that

continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

and its youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), should

determine pertinent

activities of WONAAC.

After caraiul consideration os this natter, the Bureau

agrees with the observations ot the Philadelphia Office that the

investigation of VONAAC should be discontinued.

However, in view

of the fact that Hondad is dominated and controlled by the SiP, a

Trotsbyist communist organization cited by the Attorney General

pursuant to Executive Order 10430, it is the responsibility of the

Bureau to investigate and report pertinent information relating

to the extent of STiP domination and control of captioned

organization.

Therefore, recipients should close separate

investigations concerning WONAAC.

In the future, report above-

described information regarding WONAC under appropriate subheading

in the SHP seniannual organizational reports.

For the information of New York, referenced Bureau

The Bureau further advised that the investigation was to be

In view of the fact

Re Minneapolis letter and letterhead memorandum

dated 9/21/72.

The Minnesota Supreme Court on 2/2/73 declared the

state's abortion law unconstitutional in its entirety

based on the 1/22/73 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court

wherein it was ruled that the states cannot prohibit abortions

during

the first six months of pregnancy.

The decision of the Minnesota Supreme Cort las

resulted in several Twin Cities area hospitals in Minneapolis

and st. Paul, Minnesota, offering facilities and providing

necessary procedures for staff members to perforn abortions

under these court rulings.

MP 2851-PSI

who has furnished reliable information

in the past,

sadvised that the object of the captioned

group was to remove anti-abortion laws from the books in the

state of Minnesota, as well as in the United states.

On 2/16/73 this source further related that the

Women's Liberation Movement supporters in the Twin Cities

area have generally reacted favorably to the court decisions

relating to abortion laws and now that the principal object

of the Minnesota Abortion Action Coalition has been achieved,

the influence of its spokesmen is expected to decline.

HELENA, MONTANA

November 27, 1967

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -- for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

Dear WSPER:

lomen Strike for Peace nationally is suoporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.

Planeloais, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-

day, January 15th, from all over the country.

He are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first

time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups; theatre personalities, .

and community leaders.

The Day is envisioned as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be

representing the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your Con-

gressren urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con-

gress reconvenes.

Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to

report on Congressional responses.

We will all meet at Union Station in Vashington at 11:30 AM and slowly walk to the

Capitol.

We ask the women to wear black.

We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will

croceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to

resent our petition io the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike

ansfield and Speaker of the House McCormack.

The delegation will read the demands be-

ore the assembled women and the two Congressmen, Leaving the Hill, the women will enter

puses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Women (place to be announced).. Women

vill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,

eading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back to our comnunities for

lementation.

Women may choose to remain in Washington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.

I you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality Com

ittee, 2140 P. St. N.W. Washington, DO (293-2020). We regret that in order to get the

owest

train fare we had to guarantee return the same day; therefore you would have to

inance your own trip back on the l6th.

Our hope is that 10,000 women will converge upon Washington. We urge you to parti

ipate.

Yours for Peace,

Ethel Taylor

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN:

I am proud of the faci that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against the war.

It was the first opportunity

tox a wonan to vote, because I was the firsi woman

elecied to congress.

I believed then,

as I do today, that women are the ones that

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human Lace.

I have always foughi for the dignity. of all

human beings - foi those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all

women will respond to the

following call

and join

me in

With highest hopes,

an the test some t to me see cattle

che Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) had been formed

primarily

by members of Women

strike for peace, a pacifist organization.

Members ot Homen Strike for Peace had formed the organization

following a statement made by former Congresswoman Jeannette

rankin of montana, In which she stated that if 10,000 American

housewives vere willing to be arrested, they could stop

the war in Vietnam.

According

to the source, the JRB was

formed as a "one shot organization" to sponsor a demonstration

in Washington, D.C., when Congress reconvenes. in 1968.

The

Same source advised that January 15, 1968,

had been established as the date of the above demonstration

in view of the fact that Congress was reconvening on that

date.

The source stated that the headquarters of the JRB

was located in New York City and that officials there and

in other large United States cities including Los Angeles,

san francisco and Washington, D.C.,

were formulating the

plans for a "march on the United States Capitol" where

the women would present to the United States Congress a

petition demanding that the Congressmen end the war in

The source stated that a small minority in the

above organization were in favor of commiting acts of civil

disobedience and being arrested. but the vast majority of

Today, January 15,

Ungress

reconvenes in Washington.

Women-from all over the United

States have gathered there to

petition the Congress in the

name of the Jeanette Rankin

Brigade.

Jeannette Rankin,

the first woman to serve in

Congress and the only person

to vote against U.S. entry

into both World Wars, leads

the women there, along with

such other sponsors

as

MrS.

M.L.King, Mrs. Harry Belafonte,

Mr's. john C. Bennett, Mrs.

Benjamin Spock,

Mrs

Judith

Morse Eaton. The Brigade is a

national coalitit.

antiwar groups mobilized

against the war in Veitham.

As the cost of the war in lives

and money mounts daily, the

women of this country call upon

congress to take action against

it.

To support the senators and

Congressmen who oppose the war,

to encourage those who are troubled

but silent, to speak out, and to

make our position known to those

who still support this immoral

war, we,

as women of Hawaii, are

gathered here.

Our message to

Reps. Mink and

. Matsunaga, to

Sens. Fong and Inouye, is that

women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government

waging a genocidal war...

women will no longer accept a government which represents a military

and industrial machine rather than its people...

women will no longer consent to raise their children in the blight

and neglect of a society geared to profit and war...

women grieve for suffering people all over the world and will no longer

remain silent while the gap widens between the rich and the poor...

We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program

commensurate with the needs of the american people; to foitos

policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries: to

pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect

international law.

American women who, as women everywhere, are the bearers and conservers

of life, will not stand idly by as life

is destroyed in our name.

About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to

Congress:

As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business

be to put an end to the war in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal

of American troops; and that the Congress turn its

attention to

ameliorating the crisis in America.

We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations

for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to

listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.

I want to be kept informed about women's peace activities.

at home

and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left

behind in Vietnam.

Re: DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED

JANUARY 15, 1968

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to a memorandum,

captioned as above, dated December 28,

1967, at Miami, Florida.

The memorandum

concerned a call issued by the Jeannette

Rankin Brigade for American Women

• to travel

to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,

to petition the United States Congress to

end

the war in Viet Nam.

A source, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami

Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and

Freedom (WILPF) had scheduled a demonstration to take place

January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida.

The demonstration

would be a

support activity for the

Jeannette Rankin Brigade

that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition

Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.

The January 16, 1968, issue of

the "Miami Herald,"

a local Miami, Florida

newspaper, contained an article entitled

"Five Thousand Women Join

Viet far protest."

The article identified Jeannette Rankin

as an 87 year old woman pacifist and

former member of Congress who voted in

Congress against the American entry into

both world wars.

A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war

demonstration take place in Miami, Florida.

Approximately

70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the

Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at

2:00 p.m. They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

slogans:

"Peace Throughout the Earth"

"We Demand An End To The War In Viet Nam Immediately"

"Peace On Earth. Good Will To All Men"

"Join Our Silent Vigil For Peace In Viet Nam"

"Vietnamese Are Our Brothers Whom We Kill"

"For A World Without War"

"We Pause To Remember Our Brothers Who Gave Their

Lives In Viet Nam"

Literature distributed identified the sponsor of

the demonstration as the "Women's International League for

Peace and Freedom" (see attached xerox copy) :

The participants, following the vigil, continued

their demonstration by walking in single file with the

anti-war signs through the downtown city streets to the

Federal Building where they dispersed at 3:15 p.m.

No incidents were observed to occur.

Source also advised that at least six people from

greater Miami had considered traveling to Washington, D. C.

to participate in the demonstration in that city being

sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade although no firm

plans had been made. Among these individuals was Greta

Lynch.

A second source in April, 1951, advised

that Greta Lynch

that year stated she

had been expelled from the Communist Party

in 1944.

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his

understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was

formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicag

Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the

national group in New York, was formed shortly therealter,

possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers

in protest against activities of the American Bar Association

which they claimed was a non-liberal,

no-progressive

organization.

League for Peace and Freedom; Cathy. Hofer and Marian Beardsley,

were also to join the above

women for the flight to Washington,

according to Source One.

On January 15, 1968, Special Agents of the Los Angeles

Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation observed a

group of women assemble in front of the Old State Building, 217

West First Street (First and Broadway, in the downtown Civic

Center), Los Angeles, Califomia, at

approximately 9:30 AM.

The women were carrying placards

indicating they were the

local representation of the JRs.

They also had two leaflets

for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended to this

memoranaum) which called for women to participate and which

indicated that a voting block of American women had the power

to put an end to the war in Vietnam. These leaflets bore the

address of the JRB as 5899 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles,

California (90019), which 1s the address of the

headquarters of

the WSP in Southern California.

starting shortly after 10:00 AM, the women procesded

to hold a rally on the south steps of the Old State Building,

with the

speakers utilizing an electronic amplification system,

which was' held by actress Leslie Parrish.

Source One indicated that Parrish had originally been

scheduled to fly to washington, D. C., to participate in the

JRB action at the Capitol, but

changed her plans at the last

minute. in order to remain in Los Angeles.

The rally was headed by Tina Tomash, who acted as

the local JRs organizer and answered some of the questions

regarding the JRB from members of the news media on the scene.

Veronica Sissons acted as mistress of ceremonies.

Speakers

included Mary Henry, Negro civil rights and poverty worker;

Margaret #right (who has been identified by Sources One and

Two as a militant black nationalist, who has been extremely

active in recent months in disturbances at Manual Arts

tigh

School, Los Angeles, which resulted in a court injunction to

prohibit her entering those school grounds); and television

actress Ellen Tichae. The speakers all called for a coalition

of women to form a strong voting block which could produce

legislation to end the war in Vietnam, end poverty and "legislated

Injustice"

some youngsters and infants.

The mother of one of the children

had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm

strapped to the back of her son who

appeared to be less than four years of age.

With Veronica Sissons again acting as mistress of / !!

ceremonies; the rally was addressed by charlotte sherman,

Margaret Wright, Tima Tomash, and Jily Schary.

The latteri

was introduced as a radio commentator employed by Los Angeles

Padio Station KLAC.

She joined the others in calling for a

coalition of women

to influence legislation and bring an end to

the war in Vietnam. She also called for support of other "liberal

radio broadcasters on our side"

, one of whom she named as

William Winter.

Charlotte Sherman was introduced as the wife of : .

It being pointed out that he was an

unsuccessful

candidate for public office,

on a peace slate,

during 1967; but that both he and his wife were continuing

fight for an end to the war in Vietnam,

She said,

"It is time.

Thoreau, indicating they were as timely today, as when he wrote

them.

Margaret Wright stated that whereer the majority of

women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,

that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel,

"Black is

beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their

attitude of

mouring. She called for the elimination of ROIC (Reserve

Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior

colleges, adding,

"They have got to get

live bullets out of the

schools,

and get

Some live teachers in."

She repeated these

same statements during the afternoon when the JRB moved to

the Los Angeles City Board of Education.

As the rally was

breaking up, Wright grabbed the

public address system and

said that it had been learned that

the City Council was in session inside the City

Hall Building.

She urged the women not to disperse, but to join her and...

others in invading the City Council

Chambers with a demand

that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though

they had not made previous arrangements for a place on the

agenda that day.

Some of the women were already out of range

the public address system and did not hear this announcement

by Wright, having already been dismissed by. Sissons and told to

reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon.

Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter

the Council Chambers. They got word to the councilmen, through

that the Council adjourn.

As the councilmen filed out of the

room, Tima Tomash rushed

to the front shouting demands that

they

return, while other of the women hissed and booed the

city legislators.

During the noon hour some of the women distributed.

leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets in

the dountown Civic Center.

At 1:00 PM, the women, whose numbers had by that

time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the Los

Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,

Los Angeles. Sissons, Wright and Tomash addressed-the

assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in

Vietnam could be better

spent in education.

Wright claimed

that many of the so-called student "arop-outs" are in reality

"push-outs"

, claiming that she herseli was one of the latter.

She said,

"We need books, not bomos.

We know this is a racist

war and

we blacks are.not going to fight a racist war"

• She

indicated that rather than fight overseas, the black people

would remain at home and fight the racists.

She also said,

"Just because I'm pro-black doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-.

white."

Wright said, "I'm not political, but I am honest. I

can't honestly get up and say the pleage of allegiance to

the

American flag, because I really don't have liberty and justice;

so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.

Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson

hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the

Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women

with her, "

"We shouldn't have to look at such pornographic

pictures.

Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los

Angeles City Corol Security Officers, during the recent.

Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright

result. She said that at the time of her arrest it had been

necessary for the arresting officers to drag her down the

hall as she was too heavy for then to carry.

Then she added

that the next time she is arrested the officers will not have

that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.

The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many

of the women left immediately. Seventy-eight women remained : :

and attempted to enter a special committee meeting being attended

by some of the School Board members.

They were informed by a

member of the administrative staff-that the public meeting of the

School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly

scheduled meeting time.. The women milled around in the hallway

outside the meeting room, until finally a staff member came

out

and told them that two members of the School Board, Reverend

James E. Jones and Dr. Julian. Nava, had agreed to grant them an

audience.

The women were then ushered into the public board

room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at

which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators

a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the

women.

One question, as to how much longer the members of the

School Board were going to permit recruiters from the armed

forces to interview students at local high schools and junior

colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the

women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed

forces to fight for this country himself when he vas 17 years

of age, and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who

wanted to do the same today. The demonstration was concluded

by 3:00 PM. There were no incidents and no arrests.

Placards carried during this demonstration in Los

Angeles bore the following captions:

-"Eat Texas Beef, Not L.B.J. Baloney"

"Woman Power Is Vote Power is Peace Power"

"Draft Beer Not Students"

"Where Have All the Men Gone-To Graveyards"

"Jeannette Rankin Brigade-Women's Votes Count, End

SCEF (Continued)

continued as an independent organization, rallying support

for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate

and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF

maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but

in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A

source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude

Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting

of the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,

1961: that the Communist Party is not

connected with any

progressive movement but indirectly they do have some influence

in the SCEF.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases

of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised

on June 3, 1966, that during the

time that the SCHW

was in

existence,

members of the Communist Party were members of

and worked actively in the SCHY; however, since the formation

of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged

to work in

the SCEF.

The source stated that the SCEr is

a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a

Communist Party front organization because it has gone along

with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly

on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that

George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed

great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,

with which they are affiliated, and expressed

the view

that the SCEF is the best organization in the South

as far

as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a

better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,

and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the

SCEF, while liberal in their views, are

• by no means Communists.

APPENDIY

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the

formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC

intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to

neutralize the distorted American press:

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber

as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and Taber

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FFCC policy. This source added that during the past

year there had

been a

successful

effort by IPCC leadership to

minimiza the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC

so that

their influence as of

May, 1963, was popligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuen: to Executive

Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source ravised that Vincent

"Ted" Tee, FDCC National Office Director, wes then formulating

FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of

permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization.

This source stated that Lee believed that the PCC should.

advocate resumption of diplomatic.relations between Cuba and

the United States and should support the right of

Cubans to manage their revolution without intesierence from

other nations.

Las did

not advocate supporti; the Cuban

revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"

reported that Sensic: Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut had called

FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network

in the United States."

It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was

a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which

twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

HH 55088 DocId: 32989545 Page 720

## Page 721

"VITTEE (CONT' D)

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World

egram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC

seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity

during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street

rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active

propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting

anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional

hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United

Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which

the FPCC received

from disclosure of activities on its behalf

by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964, the previvusly mentioned second

source advised that V. T. Lee

had recently remarked that the

FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another

simiiar urganization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there

had not been any FPCC

activity in many months and that the

FPCC had been

dissolved.

Following dinner, the Washington State delegation

went to Shoreham Suite A-409 occupied by VIVIAN HALLINAN

California. Several California women were there to hear

instructions for Monday.

Rumors were rampant. One person

said police would plant two hundred "agent provocateurs" in

the line of march to create scenes whieh would result in

arrests.

It was also stated police had prepared for five

hundred arrests; that all telephones into the demonstration

headquarters

were being monitored; and that permission to

march was still being withheld.

After the California group

had been

briefed, the following instructions were read to

the Washington delegates by MALVINA REYNOLDS of California:

(1) Maintain silence throughout the march.

(2) Maintain strict discipline; walk to the right

on the sidewalk.

(3) Follow the instructions of monitors in blue

armbands who will be under orders from white arm-banded marshals.

(4) Surround and isolate any trouble makers.

15) Carry at least $10.00 on your person, preferably

$25.00.

(6) Remove all items from your purse that might

be:

considered a weapon; i.e, nail files, hat pins, etc.

Remove

all addresses except home and emergency addresses from purse.

(7) Don't wear

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were midiy self-

critical about not working for the programs the younger women

were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long

hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January

20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which

the

Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,

however, that the women working on the program were all very

experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a

satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including

the group from washington State, met at the Union Station in

Washington, D.C.

It was learned here that the instructions

which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were

evidently for the California group only, because many California

people had been badiy beaten in previous demonstrations and

they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive.

The

official pattern was different.

Mimeographed sheets headed

"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were

passed out and

these appeared to be the official instructions.

A reproduction is attached.

The Washington State

delegation was enlarged when a

Mrs BACKUP from Tacoma arrived. RADER said some of the money

usually received

from wealthy contributors had been collected

by Mrs.

BACKUP.

Reverend HAROLD-BASS of Tacoma collected

$120.00, and wanted someone else io go instead of ZEFRA

( STUDAMIRE) :

RADER

defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized

her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months

~pregnant.

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much

of the time urging the speakers to

include in their talks some-

thing about the status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKER irom

New York did inciude a paragraph from the paper the Washington.

State delegation submitted to Congress.

This was entitled;.

"American Indians and the Struggle for

Peace".

It had been

prepared by LONNIE HEALY aithough at its bottom it carried the

notation "(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation

from Washington State)."

RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the

audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,

Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the

basic organization of the gathering.

She wanted an organi-

zational meeting instead of a rally type meeting which

occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied

the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN

worked

in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and

ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and

CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very

crItIcal. MEAL, partIcularly, resented having men as

"resource people" for the grouD.

She said she thought this

was a women's congress.

TAIMI said she found herself in a

situation that was quite different in that she was working

with a

very broad spectrum of politically and economically

oriented

individuals and it was a real learning experience..

ELAINE

HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while

the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh.

She and

HELEN FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs

of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The

Seattle and Tacoma people were told to meet at the Methodist

Building, 100 Maryland Avenue.

HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,

and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about

an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem

and would be unable to attend.

Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.

LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too

tired to get up so early.

The

group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,

but they were not in their offices.

After leaving a copy of

the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the

Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)

na freedom see attachment)

they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and

BROCK EDAMS.

Mr. HICKS was out of

town.

MrS. HORSLEY knew

the:

Congressman personaily and her son knew

two of the office

personnel.

She asked that they relate to him that she was

vitally interested in peace and social justice.

Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent

about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his

political views and some of the political machinations of his

party.

The group

held at Tacoma, Washington, on

January 18, 1968, at which EMELIA CASSIDY, also known as MILLIE

CASSIDY, a member of that club, reported on her trip to Washington,

D.C. She stated she stayed at

DONNA ALLEN's home there. She said

MARJORIE RADER got an eye infection which kept her from going to

the march.

RADER remained at ALLEN's residence.

She added

ZEFRA STUDAMIRE shouldn't have gone

eNDIAN'S AND THE STRUGGLE FE

Today, in Batile Creci:, Michigan, the city's seal, adopted in 1551,

ici. t and

violoni vecause it pictures a white man hitting an naimed

Ii0aan rich a rif'e bute. Sone Indian youth view the television

progra:o

jister as indicaiire of racist America.

The National Congress of Am'rican

Indians opposes inis distorcion of hiscory. Beatings and murdur of Indians

en isnine go unchallenged.

Congress voted in 195 io open up Indian land

reservations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this rides established

¿ribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities

more opportunity to harrass and open the way to ternination of our treatles

and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It Is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier

in Viet Nam.

In the chree years before 1907, more Indian children below the

age of lu had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of

tle entire Viet Nan War (as of the end of 196ú). Most of these were children

beion the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in

school, over television,

in cartoons; the Indian has become a joice, to white

Americans:

We pay because we don't know our own history,

The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history

of Indian-Americans.

When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go

deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand.

Just as some

Nezro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of

identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.

This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances

and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

ycars. They have fought in the courts since at least 1830 when the case of

the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the

United States to protect an Indian Tribe In its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have

waged against the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding

the Viet Nam war.

We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet

the Indian people have. suffered from the same policy of extermination and

destruction of their identity.

We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with

United States'

genocide for 200 years!

We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations

Resolution, "Ireaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct

the history and policy of genicide against the Indian yeople. Today this

refers to the destruction of their identity as a people and linte with the

strugsles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy

of genocide, of racion, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of

and unconstitutional infringement of their most Menume Tagion to does

free speech and the right to petition their government for a redress of

grievances.

Upon informing the Capitol Police of their planned march to the Capitol building

to present their petition, the women were threatened with arrest under 40 U.s.C.

193 (a) et. seg. which, after desining the area considered Capitol Grounds, states:

"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions

or assemblages in said United States Capitol Grounds, or to,

display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or

adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization,.

or movement....

The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions

will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol

Police. The exceptions are allowed on "ocassions of national interest becoming

the congnizance and entertainment of Congress."

The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the

entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which

was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which

is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to •

declare it unconstitutional.

We have asked the Federal District Court for the

Districtof Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to

January 15th. Our request was denied.

The same request was made to the District

of Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible

to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the

appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence

of ultimate victory.

This is far from the last time that these women or any other Americans intend

to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

Districtof Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to

January 15th. Our request was denied.

The same request was made to the District

o1 Columbia Court of Appeals and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible

to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the

appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence

of ultimate victory.

This is far from the last time that these women or any other Americans intend

to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

WELFARE FACTS

on welfare programs in the United states began with passage of

.:!E

sroial Securlty Act---in 1935, authorizing federal grants to

states for public arsistance and

child welfare programE.

the Washington Legiolature consalod the Paupers Law of 1654 and

enacted a State Social Security Law. "Welfaiu" ic? toen a bone of

contention ever since.

Greenleigh Peport

In 1963, the Washington Legislature afpiorriated $20,000 for a study

of the state's public assistance programs.

The study was made by

Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presentod in

Decembari

1964.

This report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standal s based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions,?? 'e 40% below the minimun

standards for health and decency.

Speaking of child

welfare needs, the report sald: "There 15 an excessive

and increasing rate of referral of children to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.

There 1s an excessive and Increasing trend for children

to be removed from their natural families and cared

for glsewhere."

WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions.

The 1967

Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring 1t's

pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.

New

standards were put into effect July first.

Increased allowances

for rent vary from county to county.

Other allowances were Increased

an average of 10-3/4%eIn King County the total Increase was 16%.

Thus, King County grants have been Increased by 28% since 1964,

but the cost of living has increased by at least 5% Grants are stil

17% less than acceptable levels.

The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of

two adults, a boy 13, and a girl 8, 1s $285.80 a

month--$3,429 a year.

But recent changes in the

Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even

this figure.

The local welfare officials will not

REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

There is much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to

work.

Yet who will take care of the children? Child care costs from

$60 to

$80 per child per month in Seattle.

Some examples of women's wages:

Nurses Aid - $1.40 per hour

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised

that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers

Party (SWP)

minority group under the leadership of National Committee

member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority groud,

and interpretation of political events, split from the swE

on the

grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by

departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and

retreating from the fight for the world socialist

revolution. The final issue which ultimately forced the

split was

the minority's opposition to the SWP regroupment

policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party.

(CP) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority

as petty-bourgeois.

ne minority program, according to the source:

advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has

as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a

complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing

capitalism in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960, source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name Workers World Party.

• On May 1, 1967, a second confidential source

advised that the Workers World Party, which maintains head- :

with the Soviet Union.
