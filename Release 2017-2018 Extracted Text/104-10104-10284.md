NORTON, flle 100-300-17.

• 1(erence lorward audA memerandum about NORTON

to Chief of Station,

. Since that date FBI reports have shown that

NORTON is a con mas, and U.S. AlI Force Medical records have re-

vealed that he was discharged in July 1950 as a renult of paychlatrie

problems, having tried on two or more occasiona to commit nuicide.

NORTON's lies about CIA first appeared In the Vancouver Sun on 5

Augunt 1967.

3.. The attached FBI Teport, DBB 77295, 10 April 1967, concerns

another example of disinformation appearing in Vancouver, involving the

Sus, and related to the Garrinen case. A check of Agoney files showed

that we hive no record of TreVOr LAUTENS, MArIO GRACIAS, 0I @

Mins Dorolay WHITTY. The reference of the unidentified caller to

CRAGIAS may have been a garble lor Manuel CARCIA Gonzalez, whom

Garsison has named as one of the assaumins of President Kennedy but

who appears to have disappeared or to be non-extetent. There are no

Agency faces (lacluding IMWAVE) on CARCIA.

assassinated not by pro-Communist Lee Harvey Oawald but rather ae

a result of a right-wing conspiracy involving CIA.

4. The aurfacing of two such allegations in or through the Vancouver

Sun seems to place a strain on coincidence. De you have any information

about the use of the Sun in other surfacings of MHORDER propaganda

against CIA? ls there any Information about contacts between employees of

the Sun and representatives of Seviet intelligence? If no such information

lo at hand, it would be appreciated li these questions were forwarded to

the Statton. Although Headquarters has no record of Trever LAUTENS,

It lo conceivable that Station flles may also hold information about him.
