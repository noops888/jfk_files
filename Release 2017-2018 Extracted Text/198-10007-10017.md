SUBJECT:

First Progress Report, Sub-Committee on Cuban

Subversion

ENCLOSURE: Progress Achieved in Impeding Travel to Cuba:

1. On 8 March the President approved certain actions proposed to

combat Castro-Communist subversion in Latin America. Subsequently,

the related departments and agencies undertook to execute those

decisions.

This is the first report of progress achieved.

2. The three-week period covered by the report has been sufficient

to set the program in motion and to bring about the following principal

developments, which come within the purview of the sub-committee:

a. In addition to the program on control of subversive travel,

approved by the President on 8 March, four companion action pro-

grams have also been completed and forwarded for approval,

covering the movements of arms, the movement of propaganda

materials, the exchange of intelligence, and surveillance of the

Caribbean.

b. Action programs on the control of the movement of funds

for subversive purposes and the training of Latin Americans in

the United States are in preparation.

c. Preparations have been made, including the development of

a set of action objectives, for use in the ministerial meeting on

security in Managua on 3 April.

d. Tangible progress is evident in the effort to impede and

monitor the travel of subversives through Mexico. That country,

as a result of efforts by the Department of State and the Central

concerned are summarized in the enclosure. Subsequent reports will

be submitted on the first day of each month. These reports will cover
