and FRANK

FERRARO would be taking over.

Informant also advised on this

date that

he had obtained $100,000 from FAI TONI, SALERNO.

in the form of an interest, free the loan which money

was to be used by ANTHONy RuSSo.

Also on 3/3/64, informant related that

the subject was intending

to sell his home in Englewdrigliffs,

Jersey, and although it is worth $100,000, the subject

as little as $62,000 for it just to get his

money out of the country.

EBOLI stated that he would take

this money along with $30,000 or $35,000 that he has in

AT&T stock, and place it possibly in

a bank in Nassau where

it could earn him 6 or 7% interest.

His concern centered

around the fact, that according to

the informant, he

was being audited by Internal Revenue Service for the

years 1960 and 1961 and feared that the Government

would put a lien on his money. He was heard to make

a remark that "any minute something is going to

in."

SAS participating in the physical surveillance

of the subject on 3/4/64 were LEONARD H. MC COY, PATRICK

J. MOYNIHAN, JOHN D. SWIFT,

JEROME N. BOWERS, RICHARD P. CAREY

and Inspector WILLIAM SULLIVAN.
