is a notation that he had been in New York for the past few months

on theatre work.

It has not been possible as yet to establish the

exaot whereabouts of LAWSON, but it is contemplated that this infornation

will presently become available through the confidential contacts

astablished in connection with this investigation.

It lo desired to sot forth briefly an indication of

BIBERMAN's known status in the Cosmunist front movement.

The Los Angoles

files horoin cited disclose that he assumed the local leadership of the

forner Aneriean Peaco Crusade in June of 1940; and wrote a long

article in the "New Masses" on August 20, 1940, which reflects the

alleged motives of that organization.

His close associates in this

movement, which has been definitely shown to be a Connunist sponsored

organization, are:

SAMUEL ORNITZ

GUY ENDORE

DONALD I. HEALY

RICHARD S. OTTO

GLENDA SULLIVAN

JOHN STAPE

THOMAS P. CULLEN

BIBERMAN has appeared publicly on many occasions,

speaking on behalf of the American Peace Mobilisation, which sucoseded

the American Peage Crusade, and Confidential National Defense Informant

L. A. #3, whose identity i known to the Bureau, describes him as follows.

"Ho is one of the most menaoing figures in the

local revolutionary ranks today by reason of his

amooth manner, his unquestionable brilliance of

mind, his quick thinking, his pleasant personality,

and a quality which seems to make him equal to any

exigency.

He possesses a pleasing speaking voice,

and is billed at all of these affairs as a motion

pioture director."

JOHN HOWARD LAWSON has been present in Los Angeles at

numerous meetings at which BIBERMAN spoke, and it is evident that they

were closely associated.

The present offices of the American Peace Crusade are

located at 126 South Spring Street, telephone MIchigan 2092, and a source

usually found extrenely reliablo has been established to obtain infornation

of value from his office.

It has been established that THOMAS P. CULLEN, above

mentioned, is most frequently in charge of the office; and that BIBERMAN

visitsthis point rarely. A Hollywood office of the Amorican Peace

Mobilization is located at 1558 North Vine Street, and by observation,

it has beon determined that this is a one-room office on the second

floor of the Otto K. Olson Building, at the corner of Selma and Vine Streets.
