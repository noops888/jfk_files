Re New York letter 7/2/64 and Paris 0-7 9/28/64.

The Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST),

French domestic counterespionage service, advised by

memorandum received October 1, 1964 that the name Gelot

does not pertain to a person but is the name of a private

company located at 12 Placè Vendôme, Paris 1, which is

engaged in the sale of hats for men, women and children,

in France and abroad.

It was impossible to determine if

the subject had entered into commercial transactions with

the Gelot Company.

Additional inquiry is pending in France

and Portugal. (S)
