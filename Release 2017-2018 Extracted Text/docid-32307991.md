until

finally the faction controlled by JOE ZERILLI succeeded

In getting enough power to form an organization.

He stated

that this organization,

as it gained power, gradually took

over all of the rackets in the Detroit area and still exists

at the present time, stronger and richer than ever.

The

informant stated that up until twenty years ago, JOHN "PAPA JOHN"

PRIZIOLA waS active in numbers and narcotics traffic in Detroit

and was second in power only after JOE ZERILLI, "BLACK BILL"

He advised that PETE CORRADO, who died in 195%,

began amassing a tremendous fortune in numbers and at the time

of his death controlled the Murphy House which was the largest

numbers operation in Detroit as well as all illegal operations

stenning fron the Greek Town area of Detroit.

Informant stated

that the COrRADOs own property in Detroit at the present time

valued at over $32, 000, 000.00 and added that this

amount does

not include hard cash which they have stashed away.

The source stated that ANGELO MELI and FRANK MELI

also became powerful and wealthy in those years. He stated

that ANGELO MELI iS

today considered one of the big men in the

Detroit syndicate.

As an example of the strength of the Detroit syndicate,

the informant related that many years ago he worked for the

Ford Motor Company under HARRY BENNETT.

He stated that there

were. numerous ex-convicts on the Ford Motor Company payroll

who were acting in the same capacity that he was.

He advised

that his only job was to

"be available".

His job was to be

ready to act in the

event that strong arm men or strike breakers

were needed.

He further advised that part of the deal was

that each week he had to turm over one day's pay to "BLACK LEO"

ECELLUEA

the

syndicate representative.

This source speaks of the organized Italian criminal

element in Detroit as the "syndicate" which he stated is

the

same as the Mafia.

He advised that he had not heard of the

term ICN until the Senate hearings in which JOE VALACHI waS

witness.
