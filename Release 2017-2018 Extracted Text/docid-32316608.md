had facilities for setting up training bases in Guatemala

and

I Haiti and that he would soon be leaving for Chicago

to talk to interested parties who would finance the

project. (XU

according to MM T-l, on May 30, 1964,

HERNANDEZ and

Also?ther nembers. of FACE were Invited by

two Americans named "PHILIP PATRICK" and

visit a military camp which, according to PATRICK and

DAVID, had been

donated by Americans.

Consequently

HERNANDEZ accompanied by PATRICK, DAVID and several

unidentified members of FACE went to an airfield where

there was a 40-passenger aircraft which would transport

them to the encampment:

According to HERNANDEZ,

they

waited for about one hour and when the pilot failed to

arrive,

they left for the encampment by car,

, arriving

there about

an hour and twenty minutes later.

The

encampment was described by FERNANDEZ as being an abandoned

airfield.

representative of the NBC was taking pictures of some

parachute jumpers representing themselves supposedly

as Cuban exiles in training.

However, these jumpers

were actually American sports jumpers.

According to MM T-2, Colonel LEON took some guns

along with his party hoping to have photographs taken of

him and his companions in training but due to restrictions

of the Sheriff's Office, which covered that field, no weapons

were removed from automobiles occupied by LEON and his

companions.

MM T-2 said that PAULINO SIERRA has no training

bases located anywhere although he 1s always talking of

grandiose plans to set up camps through his alleged

connections with Important officials in Latin America.

It is to be noted that previous investigation has reflected

that FACE 1s a small anti-CASTRO organization headquartered

In Miami.
