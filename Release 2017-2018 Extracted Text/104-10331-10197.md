MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

J. Barry Harrelson

JFK Project Officer

OIM/HRP

Marina Oswald's Original 201 File

OFFICE:

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

ARRB has requested that the all original files of the Oswalds be transferred to NARA'S JFK Collection by 30 Sept. A copy of

Marina's 201 minis the FBI documents exist in the microfilm part of the sequestered collection, and a releasable version has been

prepared for transfer to NARA. Since the original file contains both CIA and FBI documents some of which are still be classifed, the

current plan is to put the entire original file into the protected part of the collection. HRP will keep a complete copy of the file. At a

later date a joint CIA-FBI team can review the file to determine if it can be released in full. I will confirm this with Steve Tilley at NARA.

Let me know soonest if you have any problems with this approach.
