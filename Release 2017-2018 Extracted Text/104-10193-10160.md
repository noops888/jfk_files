VON THADDEN BEGINS BY TRACING THE HISTORY OF

THE UNITED STATES' RELATIOYSHIP WITH GERMAN FROM WORLD

VAR I TO THE PRESÉNT, DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO

THE 1929 STOCÄ MARKÉT CRASHI. HÈ GIVES CREDIT TO THE

UNITED STATES FOR HELPING. EUROPE BACK ON ITS

FEET AFTER

WORLD WAR LI THROUGH THE MARSHALL PLAN. BUT POINTS OUT

THAT THE NATIONS WHICH WERE HELPED USED THE AID TO BUILD

AN EXPORT BASE WIIICH NOW IS CONTRIBUTING TO AMERICA'S

FINANCIAL TROUBLES. HE SAYS THAT GERMANY AND OTHER •

COUNTRIES BECAME INFECTED WITH AN "EXPORT HYSTERIA"

AFTER THE WAR WHICH HAD SHORT TERM BENEFITS FOR WORLD

TRADE; BUT WHICH IN THE LONG RUN DAMAGED THE DOMESTIC

ECONONIES OF THE EXPORTING COUNTRIES.

3. THE 15 AUGUST 1971 SPEECHI BY PRESIDENT NIXON IS

COMPARED WITH THE 21 OCTOBER 1929 STOCK MARKET CR.ISH,

AND VON THADDEN SAYS TIAT THE SPEECH WILL HAVE JUST AS

PROFOUND AN EFFECT ON THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM AS DID

THE CRAST.

HE DEPICTS THE SPEFCH AND THE RESULTING CONTROIS

IN HIS ANALYSIS OF THE TYPE CE WORLD ECONONIC

SYSTEN WHICH SHOULD FOLLOW THE CURRENT AMERICAN CONTROLS

AND FLOATING OF THE DOLLAR, VON THADDEN DRAWS HEAVILY FROM

THE 23 SEPTEMBER PRESS CONFERENCE OF FRENCH PRESIDENT POMPIDOU..

HE SAYS THAT THE DOLLAR CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED THE

SINGLE WORLD CURRENCY. THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF EUROPE

MAKES IT NECESSARY THAT A EUROPEAN RESERVE CURRENCY BE

AVAILABLE AS A SECOND WORLD CURRENCY. THIS CANNOT BE

THE BRITISH POUND AS MANY PEOPLE AT ONE TIME WOULD HAVE

BELIEVED, BUT MUST BE A CURRENCY ACCEPTED BY BOTH FRANCE

AND GERMANY AND ADMINISTERED BY A COMMON GERMAN-FRENCH

BANK SUPPORTED BY GOLD. ALL EUROPEAN STATES WOULD USE

THIS BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.

VON THADDEN VIEWS POMPIDOU'S SPEECH AS A SIGNAL TO THE

UNITED STATES THAY THE FRENCH ARE NOT WILLING TO STAY

PERMANENTLY UNDER ECONOMIC PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON, AND

AS PROVIDING AN OUTLINE OF THE TYPE OF ECONONIC ORDER

EUROPE SHOULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE. HE CRITICIZES THE WEST

GERMAN GOVERNMENT FOR NOT TAKING A SIMILAR STAND, SAYING

THAT WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE STATE TO PUT ECONOMIC

PRESSURE ON OTKER STATES, THE SITUATION CAN LEAD TO

(Field Comment:" If the study is atfll consideredicurrent,

it 1g

unclear how. It fits with Benda'g Növember 1968 statement that there

was sufficient evidence to obtain a ban against the NPD.)

3.

The study summarized the case which could be brought

against the NPD as followg:

It could be shown that there was a similarity

between the NPD and the

National Socialist German Workers

Party. (NSDAP) which has been outlawed.

It could be argued that the goals, and parts of

the party platform, of the NPD are contrary to the prin

:ciples of a free democratic state.

The study concludes that a sufficlently strong case could be pre

sented to prevent the case being thrown out by the courts without

a hearing..

The study lists the following points which the NPD could

be expected to use in its defense:

The party could prove that it has given firm instruc

[tloas to its members not to engage in rowdyiam or violence.

It could show that a sizeable number of former

NSDAP members have been forced out of the party as part

of the Selbstreinigung (self-cleaning) process.

which are in accord with democratic prineiples.

It could point out that other political parties

The study states that it would be very difficult to re-

fute

these NPD defenses in court.

The government would have to

admit that sfnce carly 1908 there lave been very few statements

made by NPD leaders, or incideats

caused by the NPD,

be used to support the government's case.

objectively, It would

have to be admitted that

incidents

of violence in

which

the

•NPD has

been involved were

initiated by opponents of the party.

The study predicts the following probable results should

the government win its case

agalnst the NPD:

The NPD would probably respect the prohibition.

It is very untikely that the NPD would attempt to go under

ground as the Illegal Comaunist Party of Germany (NPD) did.

• b.: NPD members and sympathizers would not change their

opinions because.of

a ban.

Many would

join other groups

or parttes and continue

to work for their political bellefs.

NPD and rightist sympathizers would begin a cam-

paign for the banning of the new German Communiat Party

(DKP) and other leftist groups.

d.

A ban of the NPD would be well received in foreign

countries.

The study concludes that if the government should lose a

case against the NPD, it would be the result of the lack of valid

evidence (Benetuschwiertgkelten). In such an event, the following

adverge effects would occur:

publicity.

The NPD would receive a new impetus and valuable

The policy of Selbstreinigung which has had some

success in keeping former Nazis out of key positions would

be halted..

Many middle-class persons who sympathize with the

NPD, but who have refrained from open support because of

stigma of being associated with a party which could be

declared illegal, would join the party or become active

supporters.

The party would undoubtedly attract more members.

(Field Comment:

The NPD leadership is known to be worried

because the party's membership has not increased sig0if1-

cantly during the past 18 months.)

WEST GERMANY'S.SATIONAL DEMOCRATS.AND THE GRAND COALITION

Germaay's far-right Vasional Democratic Party

(NPD) showed another increase

in strength in recent

elections 'in Baden-Wuertterberg, while the Social

Democrats (SPD) lost heavily.

This' outcome in a

traditionally liberal and prosperous state appears

to stem in part from the dissatisfaction of many

Socialists and trade unionisss

in the SPD with

their party's cabinet cooperation with the Christian

Democrats (CDU) .

Another

factor was the discontent

of farmers. and refugees with the policies

of

the

Grand Coalition in Bonn.

Consern over student dis

orders contributed to the x2s gains, but this was

not as decisive as some have

supposed.

Despite -

these gains,

the NPD is unlikely

to

achieve

growth comparable to that os she Nazi Party in the

early 1930s.

The outcome in Baden-huerttemberg

confirmed

the

belief of many Socialists

that their coopera-

tion with the CDU at both

the national and state

level is proving to be unpro: cable

for the party.

As a result, they have

alreach decided at the

state

level not to renew cabinet coperation with the

CDU in Bades-wuerttemberg,

this making prospects

for the Bona coalition appear less favorable.

Nevertheless, SPD leaders in Born remain cormitted

to the Grand Coalition and

serious instability at

the federal ievel seems unlikely.

Over the long

run

the outcore of this lates: election may lave

certain

implications nationally, including

the

possibility chat

Bonn and Weimar

Many misleading analogies

and Weimar republics

precedent may help, however,

to

explain why some observers view.

the coalition problem seriously.

n March 1930, another gran

oalition with SPD participatio

collapsed ovar the question of

-cuts

in unemployment insurance,

leading to the formation'of a

conservative majority government

under Heinrich Bruening..

Bruening

was later replaced by the reac

tionary Franz von Papen, who in

turn

was followed first by a wire-

pulling general, Kurt von Schle

cher, and then by Adolf Hitler.

The worst aspect of the SPD with

drawal was

that it made the par-

liament ineffective and power-

less.

Once minority government was

embarked on, supported by presi-

dential prérogatives, there was

no effective test for legitimacy

except the will of Hindenburg by

then susceptible and old. The

Nazis ultimately came to power,

not by a majority vote, but through

the paralysis and impotence of the

constitutional system

and through

intrigues in the presidential

palace on the part of those, espe-

cially Papen and Schleicher, who

thought they could "use" Nazi

mass

support.

In contrast to the 30g,

Ear weaker,* and aside from all

the other factors inhibiting a

recurrence, the Weimar precedent

itself must influence SPD leaders

in Bonn.

They are completely

committed personally to the pres-

ent coalition.

Another possibility might

be a left-wing withdrawal from

the. SPD,

although the

leadership

for a dissident. faction has vet

to emerge.

This might provide

a healthy

outlet"for

of the system without a turn to

minority rule.

Unlike the early

19305,

virtually all West Ger-

man politicians now would do their

best to maintain a functioning

constitutional system.

Real.

dangers will probably not arise

unless, as in the late Weimar

period, the government finds it-

self confronted with economic

or political problems which seem

to defy compromise settlement or

rational solution:

the extent to which the results

continuc to be attributed

to

student activities.

this will

strengthen the demand for firm

ness.

Even before the election,

Brandt sent a telegram to SPD

state headquarters, advising that

speakers should react "completely

hard" against student demonstra-

tions.

Immediate Prospects

Assuming

that the Bonn cO-

alition lasts until the 1969

elections, its leading members

may

still

modify their policies

somewhat in the light of the

Baden-Wuerttemberg

experience.

The adverse vote of the refugees

in the recent election could act

as a brake on the policy of de-

tente with Czechoslovakia and

Poland;

although there is no

sign

of this

as yet.

Chancellor Kie-

singer has

attributed NPD gains

partly. to "years

of agitation

healthy ser -en tidance and against

healthy self-confidence,"

suggests that he may

try to sound

a more nationalistic note.

TO

Although the antistudent re-

action does not seem to have been

as important a factor as some have

believed it to be, constant vio

lence and provocation on the part

of the students, accompanied by

constant press attention, could

lead to severe official or unof-

ficial counteraction.

This, in

turn, could bring more serious

student violence,

perhaps with

the support of other elements.

Some matters of student con-

cern have appeal

for others.

Thus

students and many trade unionists

oppose emergency laws, and

this

question is

again being

agitated.

Because of the Nazi experience,

there is widespread aversion among

lcft-of-center elements to the

use of force in the name of

der,".

"or-

however great the provoca-

tion.

But

also because of the

Nazi

experience, a really large

increase in NPD votes does not

seem likely in the 1969 election,

r in an earlier new election i

aden-Wuerttemberg

should that

come to pass. (CONFIDENTIAL)

The poor showing

of the ultranationalistic

National

Democratic Party (SPD) in recent elections

in several West German

states clearly

disproves the

party's claim of providing

an acceptable alternative

to the policies and programs of the country's major

parties:

The NPD'g failure to maintain the

elections last fall is directly. attributable boch

to its own well-publicized internal dissension and

so voter preference for the Christian Democrats and

Socialists deriving from the image of vigor and

decisiveness imparted by

their "grand coalition"

ical apparatus capable of func-

The new party soon distinguished

itself by its relative success

in attracting the support of other

ultranationalistic elements and a

variety of politicalimalcontents.

Earlier attemces by other groups

to unite disparste nattonalists

invariably had foundered

minimum

required for representa-

Bundestag.

In local

elections in Bavaria and Schlesvig

Holstein in March 1966, however,

the.NPD showed that it could com

mand pockets of strength.

In the

Bavarian cities of Nuremberg and

Bayreuth, it received between 7

and 10 percent of the vote and

elected representatives to the lo

cal governing councils.

These

gains were facilitated by concen

trating the party's efforts in

selected areas such as the Proteg

tant centers of Middle and Upper

Franconia in heavily Catholic

Bavaria.

The first clear demonstra-

cion that the NPD could attract

nore than the ultrarationalist

vote came two weeks later in

Hamburg, where the party nearly

doubled its vote as

compared with

the Bundestag election the year

before.

Although the NPD failed

to elect any deputies, the Chris-

tian Democrats and the Socialists

were concerned about its ability

to secure even 3.9 percent of

the vote.

It is also possible that new

for the infiltration of morkers

within factories and

workers councils.: The Bft has also

The BIV undertook a survey of the election results at the

village and county

level in Land Ressa.

„lots surrey showed

that the NPD had substantinl success in 'areas containing

Geran military installations. It was further determined

that the NPD had considerable appeal among non-cormissioned

professional soldiers who feel they have failed to find

acceptance in the postwar German society.

This negative

attitude has been

less among Bundeswehr officers and draftees

than among non-commissioned officers, who feel themselves under-

The BfV has contacted

the security organizations of the Bundeswehr to under
