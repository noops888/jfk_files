Without fully identifying the individual or

matter being discussed, Davidson

stay there awhile because they are now sitting for the

"Grand Jury",

and they want to ask hin about those two

chocke. Davidson continued by conjecturing that what

probably happened was that "Prank" got his regular check for

& thousand, and that "Flood" re-endorsed it and cashed it

at the bank in the Capitol for "franky,)Davidson Larned

Morales to got word to Nicaragua, and

Commented on the

rocent elections in

Nicaragua indicating that this could

wreck overything:

askod if there was any way to stop it, and Davidson replied

that although he is close to "Drew", he could do nothing.

He said that he had even tried "plata» (slang for silver).

Davidson continued by relating that about a year

ago he had a drink with "Frank" and the "Goneral® at which

time he said "Look, Frank, you should not have done that."

"Frank" replied by

indicating complete unconcern for Drew

Davidson esplained to #Frank that it did not

matter whether he was sight or vrong, that Pearson would

pat it in
