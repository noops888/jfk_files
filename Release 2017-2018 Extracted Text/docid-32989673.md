Attorney General be furnished a brief statement concerning FEl relation-

ships with the Senate Select Committee and the House Select Committee

for inclusion in a statement being prepared for submission to the White

bring together anticipated problems concerning the two committees in the

hope that a means for resolving these matters might be found.

I discussed this request with Mit. Jenkins in the abeence of

Mir. Callahan and I returned Mr. Narvin's call and dictated to the

Attorney General's secretary, I requested her to furnish me with a copy

of the dictatton. Attached is the page furnished by the Attorney General's

FBI Relationships with the Senate and House Select Committees

PLATE

*ATTON CONTAIN

ARGIN IN UNGLASSIFUS

WAT/OLLULOC BYSPRAI

Senate Select Committee

FBI relationships with the Senate Select Committee generally

have been harmonious with responses to the Committee requests

delivered promptly. When difficulties have occurred they

have been overcome by negotiation and tolerance on both sides.

Future difficulties that may be confronted and require similar

resolution include the scope of any public hearing regarding

electronic surveillance of foreign nationals or-their agents

and establishments.

House Select Committee

In the past the FBI has experienced the following difficulties

with the House Select Committee:

(1) It has held public hearings which were orchestrated

to present adverse views without an opportunity for

prepared rebuttal, such as occurred on October 9, 1975,

regarding electronic surveillance matters;

(2) It has demanded delivery of documents on unreas

onably short notice considering the time necessary to

locate and prepare for delivery the enormous quantity

of documents called for;

(3) It has interviewed employees, former employees

and confidential sources of the FBI without: first

advising the FBI of the proposed interview and has

demanded the appearance of agents below the

policy-

making level.

A large number of documents dealing with electronic surveillance

conducted without a warrant between 1970 and July 30, 1975, were

furnished to the Committee on Friday, October 10, 1975.

Certain

excisions in these documents were made and it remains to be seen

whether the Committee will accept the determinations made as to

what types of information, e.g., identities of subjects who were

monitored, should have been excised.

The overriding concern for the future is the need to establish

an understanding on both sides of the policies to be followed by

each in responding to the Committee's mandate. • General agreement

to specified operating procedures would alleviate the suspicion

on the part.of the Committee and the fear of Committee geesponsi-

bility on the part of the FBI.

During the discussion on 10/20/75 concerning the

forthcoming testimony of Assistant Director W. Raymond Wannall,,

Mr. Wannall mentioned to the Senate Select Committee Staff Members

present (John I. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director, Michael

Epstein, and Mark Gitenstein) that in view of the fact these

hearings would be open to the public the Committee would not be

fully briefed concerning the background involved in the Bureau

mail opening programs because of the sensitivity involved.

Elliff indicated that he was in agreement and that he would

contact F. A. 0. Schwartz, Chief Counsel of the Committee,

see if executive session testimony could be arranged. Elliff

subsequently telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly of this

Division and advised him that Mr. Wannall could testify in

executive session on mail openings in the late aftèrnoon on

10/21/75 at approximately 4:30 p.m. subject to the approval

of the Senators.

After consultation with Assistant Director Wannall,

Elliff was advised that this would be acceptable and that

Mr. Wannall would appear for executive session testimony con-

cerning mail openings if the Senators agree to accept executive.

session testimony.*

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence

Issues

AL ROASTON GOEREMO

#EMORIS

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFLE.

DATE 12-14-00BXSP2 ALMILL

The tollowing issues are among those which are raised by

the FBI mail opening programs and the FBI's cooperation in CIA's

(1) Whether mail opening as an investigative technique

should ever, under carefully circumscribed regulations

and with proper authorization, be sanctioned in the

counter-espionage field. The FBI mail opening programs

raise this issue with more force than the CIA programs

since, in general, the FBI programs were more circum-

scribed, more tightly controlled, and more focused

than the CIA programs.

The FBI programs were also very

successful in achieving their counter-espionage goals.

communications.

In the other hand, the sanctity of the

mails is

an established tradition in the United States,

and it is doubtful that any selection criteria could be

sufficiently precise to allow for the opening of only

mail to or from illegal agents.

(2) Whether the mail openings that did occur were properly

authorized. It is clear that FBI Director Hoover

personally approved the majority of the mail opening

programs. The one which was implemented without Head-

quarters

approval was terminated

shortly after it came

to the attention of Headquarters. It does not

appear,

• however, that any Attorney General ever authorized these

programs or that the exact nature and full scope of the

programs was even brought to the attention of any Attorney

General, even though opportunities existed to do so.

Similarly, despite frequent contacts with the Postal

Inspection Service regarding the implementation of these

programs, no Chief Postal Inspector was ever informed

that the

FBI contemplated the actual opening of mail.

(3) Whether the legal implications of the mail openings were

adequately considered.

There is no evidence that legal

considerations were discussed after 1951, and there is

evidence that Headquarters personnel who

ran the programs

either considered them illegal or ignored the legal

implications entirely.

(4) Whether the mail opening programs were adequately con-

trolled to ensure that they remained focused on counter-

espionage matters. As noted above, the programs dia

generate some information regarding domestic organizations

and criminal activity, although the primary purpose

always zenained in the coleter-espionage rield. Tha fact

WW 55281 DocId: 32909673 Page 29

## Page 30

die rat;

-5-

that these programs did generate such information

apparently came as a surprise to the Headquarters

officials who ran the programs and the obvious

questions are whether this was permitted or encouraged,

and, if neither, how it could have happened.

(5)

Whether the selection of names for inclusion on the CIA's

Watch List in the Hunter Project was sufficiently con-

trolled and limited.

Because the FBI requested the CIA

for information on categories such as peace organizations

and on specific individuals and groups involved in the

peace and women's movement, a serious question is raised

whether there was sufficient restraint on the use of this

source.

NOTE :

As discussed in the FBI MAIL OPENING PROGRAMS

summary, several of the FBI

mail opening programs utilized, as

selection criteria, various

"indicators"

which,

with some accuracy,

identified letters sent by or addressed to foreign illegal agents.

The fact of these judicators has been made public by fBi officials

in recent weeks.

these indicators are still felt to be

valid and the FBI has no reason to believe that they are not still

being used.

It is recommended, therefore, that the Committee

avoid questions which would require in response an elaboration of

the nature of these indicators.

Committee in executive session to discuss classified aspects of

the FBI mail opening programs. Both of them will be witnesses

at the public hearing on FBI mail openings on Friday.

The Committee staff has agreed that the public hearing

will not disclose the following aspects of FBI mail openings:

1.

The identity of the foreign nations involved,

including the Soviet Union, Communist China, Cuba,

Mexico, Hong Kong, Japan, most Western European

countries,

and several Central and Latin American

2.

3.

The fact the mail to and from the Soviet Embassy

and the Soviet United Nations Mission, the Cuban

United Nations Mission, other Soviet-bloc Embassies

was selectively opened. (5)

The "indicators" used as criteria for selective

opening of mail screened in several other programs

designed to detect illegal foreign intelligence

agents in the United States.

(The fact that there

"indicators," but not their nature, may be

disclosed publicly.)

4. The identities of specific individuals and groups

whose mail was opened either by the FBIL

FBI Officials wi1l

state publicly that some of these, especially in

the category

"peace and protest groups," were not

adequately justified.) Some of these included:

3. What was the actual intelligence value of the

material supplied to the FBI by the CIA from

its mail opening operation?

4. How good are the "indicators" in selecting mail '

of foreign intelligence agents only and not

mail of American citizens or others who are not

foreign agents?

5. What standards were used for opening mail to and

from Communist China, and what was the intelligence

value of these programs?

6. DO FBI counterespionage officials desire to resume

any mail opening programs, with proper authorization

from Congress and the Attorney General?

7.

How do the benefits of mail opening compare with

the benefits of warrantless electronic surveillance

currently used by the FBI for foreign intelligence

and counterintelligence purposes?

NATHANIEL, WALTER JUNIOR

Nathaniel Walter Junior has been identified as a

member of the Black

Panther Party (BPP).

• The BPP is a black extremist organization

started in Oakland, California, in December,

1966.

It advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics to. bring about the overthrow of the

United States Government.

Junior appeared in United States District Court,

Chicago, Illinois, on January 18, 1971, and entered a

plea of

guilty on Federal Firearms charges against him.

as well as on a bail jumping charge.

On February 5,

1971, United States District Judge Sam J. Perry, Chicago,

Illinois, sentenced

Junior to three years probation on the

above charges.

On September 28, 1971, Junior was interviewed

by a Special

Agent of the

Federal Bureau-of-Investigation

(EBI).

Junior advised that he was no longer a member of the

BPP, having resigned as a result of a dispute with

Bobby Rush, Deputy Minister of Defense of the Illinois

BPP, regarding the unauthorized use of Panther funds

by Rush.

He further alienated himself with the BPP

when, in January, 1971, he refused to repay the BPP $1, 500.00

had been paid as

bail to secure his release from

jail

on the aforementioned charges.

Junior furnished the following information

concerning his activities with the BPP:

He originally joined the BPP at the invitation

.of Fred Hampton, in the Fall of 1968. Hampton at the time

was the Chairman of the Illinois BPP and was subsequently

sinin by Cook County States Attornoy Officers, December 4,

1969, Who at the time were executing a search warrant in

Chicago, Illinois.

While in the party, Junior held the title of Field

Sccretary.and was privy to administrative matters relating

to the BPP.

On two occasions he traveled out of the state

on

party business,

once to Bpp National Headquarters for the

purpose of mooting the National start, and to washington, D. Ca.

to attend the rovolutionari

people's

Constitutional

Convention (RPCC).

The RPCC, held August 7, 1970, at Howard University,

Washington, D. C..

was organized by the

BPP to structure

"a constitution that will guarantee us the right to life, liberty.

and the pursuit of happiness: a constitution that serves

people instead of a constitution that serves the ruling class".

In early 1969, Junior negotiated to purchase a quantity of

weapons from an undercover United States Treasury Agent, for

the BPP and as a result was arrested on a Federal Firearms charge:

While out of jail on this charge, Junior learned that he had

been indicted

and. decidod to jump bond and leave the country.

Junior left the country for Canada, through the aid

of porsons connected with the drait resistence movement,

and who did not know of his pending criminal charges or

his

affiliation with the BPP. He declined to identify these

persons who aided

in his

leaving the country or those who

aided him in Canada.

The Bpp in no way aided him in leaving the country

nor did they provide him any financial assistance while he

11

was a fugitive and for this he is bitter.

Junior decided to leave Canada and return to

Chicago for the purpose of

surrendering to face trial

on the federal Firearms Act charge, because of his

parents' poor health.

by Bobby Rush, Illinois Minister of Dofenic.

Junior tral

to bring the party back to its former state, by calling for

rciorms

and reproanization, which was resisted by Rush and he

was subsequently removed from the Contral Staff and he

resigned from the party in Soptembor, 1970.

He is in no way

involved with the BPP, or other

extrcmist activities, at this time nor does he have any plans

to resume his association with the BPP, as he feels "The BPP

and other organizations are boing duped by white intellectual

revolutionary hobbyists, who are taking advantage of the

hopelessness

and frustrations of the Black community to

exercise their theorios on political and social democracy. "

Junior claims to havo

no knowledge of any BPP

underground,

now or in the past;

but admits that preliminary

discussion

regarding an underground' cell of the BPP was had in the

early development of

the Illinois BPP, but that plan like most

others never got off the ground.

The BPP was,

and is, a big disappointment to Junior

in that they departed from their original concept of neighborhood

protection against police brutality, to one of international

identification with

communism,

He maintained his association

with the BPP in spite of this

change in philosophy because.

of his respect and confidence in Fred Hampton, who

rationalized that in order to further the cause of neighborhood

control they'dneed the financing and good will of governments oppose

to people oppression, no matter where these people were.

Junior feels that the BPP is dead in Illinois and

blames its demise to its identification with communism and

coalitions with white revolutionary groups.

He has three things to show for his membership in the

BPP: (1) probation on the Federal Firearms charge, (2)

three

years probation on State narcotics case (which he

claims was a

"as part of a

don]", at

by police, but to which he entered a plea. (3) an outstanding

Junior claims to have no contact with any members

or former members of the BPP, except when the persons charged

cites the numerous continuances of the kidnaping case as

an example of white hobbyists playing with young black

revolutionary hopefuls.

To him the continuances

represent

a conspiracy on the part of

the BPP attorneys and the States

Attorney's Office, as on alternate months they ask that the

case be continued

and neither ever objects.

If he could afford

it he would not avail himself of the BPP attorney's services.

Junior is required to report to his probation

Logical sources.

This is to identify two serials, copies of which were

furnished to Barbara Banoff of the staff of the Senate Select Committee

(SSC) for retention in the Committee's files.

Banoff on 10/10/75 requested copies of a memorandum

from Mr. Baumgardner to Mr. Belmont dated 3/30/60 and a letter to

the New York Office and 15 other offices dated 3/31/60, both cap-

tioned "Communist Party, USA, Counterintelligence Program,' be

furnished to the Committee. Banoff stated she believed these documents

had previously been requested but she was unable to locate them in the

Committee files. She said she desired to have these documents

because they set forth a logical program by which the FBI made an

effort to prevent the Communist Party from infiltrating legitimate

mass organizations. As an aside, she stated she thought the FBI was

successful in this effort, indicating she felt the technique was worthy

and proper.

Copies of the above two documents were made available

to a SSC representative on 10/22/75. Copies of the documents

together with a cover page indicating their receipt are attached. No

excisions were required in these documents.

This memorandum advises that the Senate Select

Committee (SSC) intends to release to the press copies of

eight FBI documents (attached).

The release of these

documents is scheduled for 10/24/75, following the appearance

of Assistant Directors Wannall and Mintz and Section Chief

Branigan before the SSC.

These documents were made available to the SSC

responsive to specific requests. They have been excised

and declassified where necessary. With regard to dissemi-

nation of FBI documents to the Select Committees of Congress,

both the White House and the Department have held that,

once a document has been excised, declassified and furnished

to either Select Committee of Congress, it is that Committee's

property to do with whatever that Committee deems appropriate.

However, we do have an understanding with the Committee that

allows for more extensive excisions once the Committee decides

to make documents available to the press.

Personnel in the

Senstudy Project have reviewed the attached eight documents

and have made additional excisions which are acceptable to

the SSC, These excisions are designed to protect Bureau

sources, targets and, where possible, the identity of Bureau

personnel.

REal 62-116385 956

The contents of the documents that will be made

available generally portray the Bureau in a favorable light.

They highlight: (1) tight supervision and control of the

nail intercept programs; (2) general objectives of the program;

(3) accomplishments; and (4) Departmental officials knowledge

of the existence of some of these programs.

Of course, it would be desirable if no documents

were released by the SSC; however, Mr. Ellift advises that

the senators are desirous of furnishing some documents to

the press. If, in fact, Bureau documents have to be released,

it appears that the ones the SSC plans to use are favorable

to the Bureau.

For the information of Bureau officials reviewing

the attached documents, no excisions have been made; however,

the brackets in red ink show what information will be

obliterated from the documents prior to their release to

the press.

and Thomas Chaimers) at CIA concerning "Project Hunter."

At this

conference our observations concerning Hunter material furnished

since

our last conference on 2/13/62 were given CIA.

In addition, we advised

CIA specifically o1 certain Hunter items which were of no interest

to us and of certain Hunter items which were of interest to us.

These

Items were set forth in memorandum form and furnished to CIA;a copy

of same is attached.

CIA advised that its "Hunter-Don' coverage was being

operated seven days a week until November 15. This concentrated

coverage is lor the purpose of deternining if there is any illegal

agent traffic.

After November 15 all Hunter coverage can be expected

to be reduced until after the Christmas mail rush has subsided.

The CIA representatives were very pleased with our analysis

of the Hunter material received and with the attention afforced it

by us.. They are very cooperative in that they are willing to focus

their attention on any particular phase of coverage we suggest for

our own benefit. For CIA's interest we furnished them a copy of the

intercept programs.

Present were Senator Church, Chairman of

Generally speaking, the reception by the Chairman and

a friendly one.

No antagonism was shown to the Bureau repre-

sentatives, and the Senators by their questions indicated a

desire to help the Bureau in our foreign counterintelligence

loperations.

At the request of the Chairman, the eight separate

mail intercept surveys were explained to

the Committee,

including the length of time that these surveys were in operation

and the value that was derived from them.

During the hearing we were supplied with a copy of a

Staff Memorandum which outlined various aspects of our operations

which would not be disclosed during a public hearing.

Staff Memorandum also outlined certain questions which could

not be discussed at a public hearing and suggested that these

questions be raised at the Executive Session..

Memorandum from Mr. W. R. Wannall to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Senstudy

At the conclusion of the hearing, considerable

questions were asked concerning legislation or direction which

would be necessary from The Congress to permit the Bureau to

carry out mail opening programs which were productive in their

results and which would not at the same time invade the privacy

of innocent American citizens.

ACTION:

WAR

This is submitted for your information.

willin

ADORADUA BY LEGAT COUNT, 10/2/T5, AN out it

I answered the Committee's questions described in the last

paragraph of this memorandum by explaining to them that in a security

case we would find it most difficult to meet the 4th Amendment standard

of probable cause in order to obtain a search warrant. for mail. If we

are to be required to obtain warrants prior to obtaining mail and if we

are to be successful, a lower standard of probable cause such as is

permissible in administrative searches such as those conducted by

Health Inspectors would be necessary. In answer to a specific question

I explained that the Supreme Court has ruled that mail is protected absolutely

by the 4th Amendment.

81-1

EXECUTIVE SESSION ON FBI MAIL OPENING PROGRAMS

FBI Assistant Director W. Raymond Wannall and William

Branigan, Chief of the Soviet Section of the FBI Counterintelligence

Branch, have requested an opportunity to appear before the Select

Committee in executive session to discuss classified aspects of

the FBI mail opening programs.

Both of them will be witnesses

at the public hearing on FBI mail openings on Friday.

The Committee staff has agreed that the public hearing

will not disclose the following aspects of FBI mail openings:

1. The identity of the

foreign nations involved,

including the Soviet Union, Communist China, Cuba,

Mexico, Hong Kong, Japan, most Western European

countries, and several Central and Latin American

countries.

2. The fact the mail to and from the Soviet Embassy

and the Soviet United Nations Mission, the Cuban

United Nations Mission, other Soviet-bloc Embassies

was selectively opened. (S)

3. The "indicators" used as criteria for selective

• opening of mail screened in several other programs

designed to detect illegal foreign intelligence

agents in the United States. (The fact that there

were "indicators," but not their nature, may be

disclosed publicly.)

4. The identities of specific individuals and groups

whose mail was opened either by the FBI or by the

CIA at the request of the FBI. (FBI officials will

state publicly that some of these, especially in

the category "peace and protest groups," were not

adequately justified.) Some of these included:

Leonard Bernstein

Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam

Jeremy Stone

Cambridge Center for Study of Public Policy

The 'following are questions which cannot be discussed in

public hearings because of this agreement.. They should be

raised at this executive session:

1. What was the actual intelligence value of FBI

mail openings aimed at mail to and from the

•(Soviet and Soviet bloc embassies? (5)

2. What was the actual intelligence value of FBI

• mail opening programs using "indicators" and

designed to detect illegal foreign intelligence

agents in the United States? (Soviet and CubanJ](3)

3. What was the actual intelligence value of the

material supplied to the FBI by the CIA "Erom

its mail opening operation?

4. How good are the "indicators" in selecting mail '

of foreign intelligence agents only and not

mail of American citizens or others who are not

foreign agents?

5. What standards were used for opening mail to and

from Communist China, and what was the intelligence

• value of these programs?

6. • Do FBI counterespionage officials desire to resume

any mail opening programs, with proper authorization

from Congress and the Attorney General?

7. How do the benefits of mail opening compare with

the benefits of warrantless electronic surveillance

currently used by the FBI for foreign intelligence

and counterintelligence purposes?

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

Re: Documents Pertaining to Requests for Mail

Covers Made by the Bureau from 1971

Through 1975

NOTE:

Materials furnished in response to this request were

obtained by review of all abstracts regarding communications to the

Postal Service requesting mail covers. Since 1971, all national secu-

rity mail covers have been requested by means of a letter to the Chief

Postal Inspector, Postal Service.

The materials being furnished only

encompass investigative matters involving domestic security cases

wherein the mail cover has been terminated whether the investigation

is pending or closed. The materials are comprised of copies of the

letters to the Postal Service and supportive memoranda

where used

in lieu of notes. These materials were reviewed and, where necessary,

excisions made. By memorandum 9/24/75, the SSC was furnished the

bulk of such documents located at that time. The documents being fur-

nished now are those which could not be immediately located. All

domestic mail cover requests which were located by means of the

abstract review have now been furnished to the SSC.

By oral agreement with the SSC staff, only domestic

security mail covers were required to be furnished.

DISRUPTION OF HATE GROUPS

The Bureau is requested to consider securing

copies of income tax returns for the UNITED KLANS OF

AMERICA, INC., KNIGETS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN; ROBERT MARVIN

SHELTON, : 1708

- 15th Street, East, Tuscaloosa, Ala., or

the ALABAMA RESCUE SERVICE, a name by which the URA is

sometimes known.

Inquiry at the banks in Tuscaloosa has failed to

reveal any accounts in the name of the UKA or ROBERT M.

SHELTON, except a small personal account of SHELTON at

the First National Bank of Tuscaloosa.

Informants have

sevised that SHELTON is paid probably

$8,000 per year for

his work as Imperial Wizard.

This money is sent in monthly

to UKA headquarters in Tuscaloosa by the individual Klaverns

and presumably put in some bank.

An examination of pertinent income tax returns

might furnish information concerning the financial standing

Of SHELTON and UKA which could be used in this program.

INTERNAL SECURITY - %

At the request of the Internal Security Section,

Ar. Willian larker,

Internal Revenue Service (IRS), was

contacted on 6/23/67 to determine the status of the IRS

case on Robert Sheiton, Imperial Wizard of the United Klans

of America.

Parker advised that IRS had initiated investiga-

tion of Shelton for possible tax evasion for the years 1963

through 1965.

This

case

is still under investigation but

indications are that Shelton owes no income taxes for 1963

and 1965 and

owes $100 in taxes for the year 1964.

According

10 Parker, it appears that the criminal tax investigation

of Shelton will be closed and the case will be referred

10 the Audit Division of IRS for civil disposition.

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is our 196? income tax return. Salary for

which there is no W-2 forms comes from several short or

part time jobs which did not withhold.

Just as last year we cannot, of course, voluntarily

pay our tax so long as the war in Vietnam continues:

Should the government run short of funds in the meantime

we suggest repeal of the oil depletion allowance or any

other of the tax breaks for the wealthy. •

Sincerely yours,

The release stated that king sent an attorney

to Cook's office io determine what the Attorney General wanted

ICC us toot O'pell. the release concluded with the statement

"Ting daid lost week O'Dell hed worked for SCC on two occasions;

Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights

Division has asked that we give him a statement concerning the Communist

Party affiliation of Hunter Pitts O'Dell. We have called to his attention

current reports which have been furnished to the Security Division, Attention

Mr. Walter Yeagley, concerning O'Dell's activities.

Marshall was interested in O'Dell's association with Rev. Martin

Luther King and he was given a copy of a report of Special Agent James F.

O'Connell dated 12/20/62 at New York, which was classified "Confidential"

which had been disseminated to Walter Yeagley of the Security Division.

This report reflected the current association of O'Dell and the organization.

of Rev. King, namely, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

In adcition to the above we also furnished him a copy of a memorandum

; from the Director to the Attorney General dated 12/6/62 and another dated 1/ 23/63,

: pertaining to O, Dell.

Marshall stated that upon review of the above intormation which was

furnished to him, he would like to have a statement from the FBI concerning

the present Communist affiliation of O'Dell, particularly, whether O'Dell

actually is a member of the Communist Party at this time.

I advised Marshall that an appropriate memorandum would be

prepared and furnished to him concerning his request. There is attached

hereto a memorandum which has been prepared by the Security Division

indicating that we have developed evidence through our coverage of the

activities of the Communist Party, USA, which indicates that as of July, 1962,

Party leaders considered O'Dell to be a member of the Party. It is being

pointed out that this information is highly sensitive and confidential.

Memo to Mr. Balmont from A. Rosen

Re: Hunter Pitts O!Dell

By way of background, Marshall indicated that the basis for his

request stems from the necessity of having to talk with Rev. Martin Luther

King with reference to O'Dell. He stated that an inquiry has been received

from King about O'Dell and apparently the Department wants to be able to

adequately handle this inquiry.

ACTION:

If approved, attached memorandum to Burke Marshall will be

handed to him. It is brief and specifically points out the need to treat

this information as highly sensitive and confidential.

On December 6, 1962, you were furnished information

Indicating that despite the Reverend Martin Iuther King's

statement of October 31, 1962, that Hunter Pltts O'Dell

had resigned his position with the Southern Christian

Leaüership Conference (SCLC), O'Dell had continued to

represent himsels as being affiliated with the New York

office of the SCIC and, during late lovember and early

Decomber, 1962, was actively engaged in the vork of

this organization. Reverend King's public statement

of jotober 31, 1962, was occasioned by an editorial in

tha reober 25, 1962, edition of the "Augusta Chronicle,"

Auguste, Georgia, wich identified O'Dell as a concealed

lember of the lational committee, Communist farcy, Usa,

who was employed by the SCIC under the allas Jack H. O'Dell.

I thought you would be interested in the fact

that on three occasions during early January, 1963, O'Dell

registered at an apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, as J. H.

O'Dell. On each occasion, O'Dell represented himselt as

being with the New lork ortice of the sull. When checking

out on Jenuary 7, 1963, O'Dell requested that the bill be

charged to the SCLE.

1. 0 gut y

An inquiry by the manager resulted in

telephonic confirmacion from the Atlanta Office of the SCLE

that that organization would pay O'Dell's bill. Also, on

January 10, 1963, O'Dell, Reverend Martin Luther King and

eight other

officials of the SCLC traveled together via

Delta Airlines arouftlanta ia Sevannel, Georgia.

On November 2, 1962, I forwarded to you a copy

CO

rais editorial identified hunter Pitts O'Dell, a concealed.

member of the National Committee, Communist Party, USA,

as employed under the alias Jack I. O'Dell in the capacity

"Acting Executive Dircetor" for the Reverend Martin Luther?

King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

various newspapers contained

accomis b a squeent assed by the reverend Martin luther

king on or aboue october 31, 1902, Wherein at was stated

O'Dell had resigned from his position with the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference.

Reverend Martin Luther

• King

is quoted in this statement as denying knowledge of the

communist affiliations of O'Dell and further describing

allegations that O'Dell was the Southeastern Director of

COMM-FBI

his organization as false in that O'Dell functioned "purely

as a technician with 90 per cent of his work taking place

in the Horth..."

King further stated that the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference has a policy that no person

• known communist affiliation can serve on

the staff, =

executive voard or its membership at large."

I thought you would be interested in the fact

that our Hew York Office has developed information that

Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall telephoned and

advised that on instructions of the Attorney General he wanted to clear

with us the rough draft of a memorandum which he was going to send

to the Bureau. As a matter of fact, the Attorney General has approved

the rough draft contingent upon our approval.

The proposed memorandum, a copy of which is attached,

relates to Hunter Pitts O'Dell and Stanley, Levison and action taken I9

advise Dr. Martin Luther King and his immediate associates of the

communist activities on the part of O'Dell and Levison. Marshall states

that some time ago it was not felt wise, in view of the position of the FBI

informant, for Marshall to say that he knew O'Dell to be under communists

Instead, he informed Dr.

King and two of his immediate

associates that O'Dell was believed by many people to have had communist

connections and his association with Dr. King's organization was not

in itse best interest.

Subsequently, on June 22, 1963, according to Marshall's

proposed memorandum, he brought this matter very explicitly to

I Dr. King's attention. Later that same date, both the Attorney General

and the President, separately, strongly urged Dr. King that there should

be no further connection between O'Dell and the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC). Thereafter, the Attorney General and

Marshall received copies of a letter dated July 3, 1963, from Dr. King

to O'Dell. In this letter King makes reference to a resignation which

O'Dell submitted some months ago which was accepted because of the

SCLC's firm policy that no communist or communist sympathizer would

be on the staff. Dr. King's letter continues by noting an investigation

had been conducted but they were unable to discover any present

connections with the Communist Party by O'Dell.

King further tells O'Dell that the situation is such that the

organization cannot even afford the risk of impressions about communist

inspiration and therefore O'Dell's temporary resignation is being made

permanent.

Mr. Marshall's proposed memorandum also advises that he

informed Dr. King on June 22, 1963, Stanley Levison was a secret

member of the Communist Party. This action was taken on direction

of the Attorney General and the President. Marshall had previously

warned Dr. King about any association with Levison. This was the

first indication given him of firm information Levison was under

communist control.

Sensitive

foreiger intelligense speration

As a matter of background, our early information concerning

the communist connections involved here came from one-of-our twor

most highly-placed communist-informants. (MY694-S*). To protect/this-

most valuable informant we insisted Levison and O'Dell not be informed by Kink

we had positive information of their communist connections.

Subsequently, with the passage of time so that the risk to

the informant was not jeopardized, the Director in a personal

conversation with the Attorney General on June 17, 1963, agreed

Dr. Martin Luther King could be informed that he should get rid of

Levison and O'Dell because they are members of the Communist Party.

It was on the basis of this advice from the Director that action was taken

by the Attorney General and the President.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

While Vir. Marshall's proposed memorandum does not spell

out the sequence of events here in detail, his summary is nevertheless

accurate and it is therefore believed we should inform Mr. Marshall

that he should feel free, of course, to submit the memorandum as he

drafted it. If approved, Mr. Marshall will be so advised telephonically.

This matter had been brought to the attention

conversations which the Attorney General had with Courtney

Evans, it was not felt to be wise in view of the sources

of the Bureau's information to

state that I knew O'Dell

to be under Communist control at any time. I did inform

DI. King and two members of his organization - Reverend

Andrew Young and Reverend Wyatt Walker -- some time ago

that since O'Dell was believed by many people to have had

Communist connections, his association with their

organization was not in the best interests of the organiza-

questions whether I had hard evidence of O'Dell's

Communist connections, however, I replied that I was not

in a position to give any:

-Following further conversations with MI. Evans

" in June, however, I brought the matter to the attention

of DI. King very explicitly. in my office on the morning

of June 22 prior to a scheduled meeting which DI. King

had with the president. This was done at the direction

of the Attorney General. Later

that morning both the

Attorney General and the President separately strongly

urged DI. King thatthere should be no further connection

between

O'Dell and the Southern Christian Leadership

DI. King stated that the connection' would be

ended.

Thereafter, theAttorney General and I both received

copies of the attached letter, dated July 3, 1963,

from DI. King to O'Dell.

On the same occasion, I also informed DI.King

that our information

was that Stanley Levison was a secret

after conversations with Mr. Evans prior to the meeting

based upon talks between the Attorney General and MI.

Levison was under Communist control. I had, however,

on a previous occasion, warned DI. King about any association

New York, New York

Dear Jack:

Several months ago you submitted your resignation pending an

investigation of your alleged affiliation with the Communist

party, as was suggested by an article to this effect in the.

Birmingham and New Orleans newspapers.

We accepted this

temporary resignation because of SCL,C's firm policy that no

Communist nor Communist sympathizer can be o2 our staff of

in our memberabip. We felt that it was imperative to conduct

an immediate investigation. As you know, we conducted what we

felt to be a thorough inquiry into these charges and were unable

to discover any present connections with the Communist party on

your part.

The situation in our country is such, however, that any allusion.

to the left brings forth an emotional response which would seem

to indicate that SCLC and the Southern Ereedom Movement are

• Communist ingpired. In these critical times we cannot afford to

risk any such impressions. We, therefore, have decided in our

Administrative Committee, that we should request you to make

your temporary resignation permanent.

We certainly appreciate the years of unselfish service which you

have put into our New York Office, and regret the necessity of

jour departure. Certainly, yours is a significant sacrifice com-

mensurate with the sufferings in jail and through loss of jobs

under racist intimidation. We all pray for the day when our

nation may be truly the land of the free.

In talking with the Attorney General and Assistant AG |:

Marshall, of the Civil Rights Division, reference was made to our

earlier

conversation concerning/Congressional

requests which had been

received by the Director, relating to alleged

communist influence in

the facial demonstrations.

The Department's original position was

that there was no immediate urgency in recontacting

Senator Honroney,

In view of recent contacts had with him by Departmental representatives.

Today, I pointed out that these requests should not be allowed to

I remain unresolved too long.

Assistant AG jarshall advised that he had drafted a proposed

letter to be used in replying to these Congressional requests,

he had ascertained that a written reply is desired, particularly by ...'

Senator Monroney.

In his letter liarshall proposes

to paraphrase the

(President's statement at his press conference on 7/17/63.

Marshall's

letter will, of course, make no reference to the President's

state-

ment, but merely indicate that this is the conclusion, predicated

upon reports and other information supplied to the Department.

In those instances where the Department is dealing with a

Member of Congress believed to be trustworthy, Marshall plans to

deliver his letters personally and to explain

that the classified

nature of the reports precludes the furnishing of specific informa-

tion in vriting or in testimony. Marshall feels that he can talk

concidentially in this way to Senator ilagnuson and thus forestall any

requests for further information. It was noted that, as a result of

the Director's conversation with

the Attorney General, Marshall had

spoken with Martin Luther King about the dangers of his associating

with Stanley Levison and accepting assistance from him.

It was,

therefore, believed that since this may get back to Members of

Congress, Marshall should tall with the individual Senators, where

this can

SA Don Roney of the New York Office advised that/NY 3810-5*

on 5/30/63 furnished information concerning a conversation on that date

between Martin Luther King and Stanley Levison, who has been a secret

Communist Party member and has contributed funds to the Communist

Party on a regular basis. King stated that he had requested a conference

with the President and the Attorney General because King thought that now

was a good time for such a conference. Levison agreed. Levison stated

that there has never been an Administration in this country that has been

as worried about the Negro problem as the present one. Levison continued

that this is brought about by the Administration's concern with the common

market problem in Europe. It was Levison's opinion that United States

prestige is very important at this time and the inability to control the

racial situation was making it more difficult. It was Levison's opinion

that the needs of the President are so great that he is all ready,

for a different policy if it can bring about the kind of controlled situation

that he feels he needs.

King and Levison agreed that the situation has to be kept moving

so that the President will have to look for an alternative. The President can

then be presented with certain alternatives. This will benefit the President, •

for then his problem, fear of violence, will be done away with. It was.:

IT., and Stanley Levison held a discussion concerning a

conference which reverend vr. ring reportedly has requested with

the President and the Attoney General.

-kevison and Reverend Vir. King agreed that this is a

good time for' such a conference and Levison stated that no

Admitistration has ever been as worried about the Negro probler

as is the present Administration. Levison added that this is based

upon the Administration's concern with the problems arising from

the Cormon Market in Europe. Levison expressed the opinion'"

that the prestige of the United States is very important at this time

and that inability to control the racial situation makes the

Administration's task more difficult.

He also said that the

President is ready for a different policy if it can bring about the

• kind of controlled situation that he feels he needs.

Reverend Mr. King and Levison agreed that it was

necessary to keep the situation moving so that the President will be

forced to look for an alternative. It was stated that the President

can then be presented with certain alternatives which will beneat

the Administration as the President's fear of violence will be done

away, with. Levison expressed the thought that the President is

ready to make a change and that a conterence at this time wouid

be fruitful.

we added that if a conference cannot be worked out,

he would like to put so much pressure on the President that he will

have to sign an Executive Order making segregation unconstitutional.

Levison stated that the method of negotiation used in

Birmingham, Alabama, will set the pattern for a series of Southern

cities. He explained this method by stating that you come in with a

package, come up with demands, discuss them and come out with a

victory,

and that in doing so you ask for more than you expect to get.

He described the goals of the movement as desegregation, jobs and

the right to vote. He described the methods of obtaining these goals

as being direct action, nonviolence and negotiation.

As previously mentioned to you, another source who has

furnished reliable intormation in the past, advised in March, 1963,

that Stanley Levison was a secret member of the Communist Party,

United States of America, who contributes to the Communist Party

on a regular basis.

I advised the Attorney General of the above information

and he suggested that the President should see this letter.

Sincerely yours,

NOTE: This memorandum is being classified "Confidential"' because

it contains information from a source, the unauthorized disclosure

of which would seriously impair the investigation of the Communist

Party, USA, and such impairment could have an adverse effect upon

the national defense interests of the country.

Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights

Division has asked that we give him a statement concerning the Communist

Party affiliation of Hunt er Pitts O'Dell. We have called to his attention

current reports which have been furnished to the Security Division, Attention

Vir. Walter Yeagley, concerning O'Dell's activities.

Marshall was interested in O'Dell's association with Rev. Martin

Luther King and he was given a copy of a report of Special Agent James F.

O'Connell dated 12/20/62 at New York,

which was classified "Confidential"

which had been disseminated to Walter Yeagley of the Security Division.

This report reflected the current association of O'Dell and the organization $

of Rev. King, namely, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) t:

In addition to the above we also furnished him a copy of a memorandum

from the Director to the Attorney General dated 12/6/62 and another dated 1/23/63

pertaining to O'Dell.

Marshall stated that upon review of the above information which was

furnished to him, he would like to have a statement from the FBI concerning

the present Communist affiliation of O'Dell, particularly, whether O'Dell

actually is a member of the Communist Party at this time.

**I advised Marshall that an appropriate memorandum would be

prepared and furnished to him concerning his request. There is attached

hereto a memorandum which has been prepared by the Security Division

indicating that we have developed evidence through our coverage of the

activities of the Communist Party, USA, which indicates that as of July, 1962,

Party leaders considered O'Dell to be a member of the Party. It is being

pointed out that this information is highly sensitive and confidential.

Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights

Division called to state that he will have to talk with Rev. Martin Luther

King with reference to Jack Hunter O'Dell.

By way of background, he stated that an inquiry has been

received from King about O'Dell and apparently the Department wants

to be able to talk to King about O'Dell.

Before Marshall can do this he states he would like to have

whatever background information we have on O'Dell. In this regard,

it is noted that O'Dell is supposed to be a member of the Communist

Party and has in the past been associated with the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference. This is King's organization. We have in the

past furnished information to the Department concerning O'Dell and his

association with Rev. King.

Marshall should be furnished with memoranda which have

heretofore been given to the Security Division. It is understood that

a report of O'Dell's activities is also available and has been furnished

to the Security Division but has not been given to the Civil Rights

Division. It would appear that Marshall is entitled to this information

if he is to properly evaluate O'Dell's background.

Marshall has asked for a summary on O'Dell. If such is not

readily available, copies of material previously furnished to the Depart-

ment would seem to suffice. He stated he has been in touch with the

AR:mpd (8)

Attorney General on this matter and is anxious to

have it handled as soon as possible.

He has bein closely aligned with

mormunists for

several years and has shown not only a willingness,

but at

times even an eagerness, to associate and confer with commu-

nist leaders and to work closely with and rely unon the advice

and guidance of dedicated communists - this despite the fact

that they have been reliably identified to him as such.

In

Februery, 1,962,

Stanley Davia Levison, a secret Communist

Party (P) member, passed the word to the car eneral seen

tary, h

You out what "as us a molengarted harxist who has

Levison - Key Communist Directing King

Levison, one of the individuals exerting the most

Influence upon king and who has greatly facilitated king's rise

to prominence, 1s a shrewd, dedicated communist and 1s nom as

such by King.

singe the late 1940's Levison has played a highlyi

ciandestine role in which he was entrusted by the Party to raise

Since 191

Levison has expended.m

effort in King's

behalf in such activities as:

actively involving himself in

rund-raising drives for king;

serving as King's legal counsel

In selected matters; predering speech material for King; assist-

ing in the mechanics of some demonstrations in which King was

involved; guiding king as to acceptance or rejection of oublic

appearances and speaking commitments; and helping King with

matters related to the latter's writings.

King's Reliance on O'Dell, A Mational Party Functionary

Another key comnunist through whom the Party exerts

influence on King is Hunter Pitts O'Dell who, 'at the Party's

last National Convention in 1959, was elected a nember of its

second highest governing body, the National Committee.

His

election was under a pseudonym. In 1960, unile working as an

assistent to the party's National Secretary for the South, James

Jackson, O'Dell also began to work actively in support of king's

movement. In June, 1962, 'King sought Levison's counsel concern-

Ing the addition of an administrative assistant to King's staff.

LAs a result of!' Levison's recommendation of O'Dell, the latter

associated himself with the seLc in Atlanta, Georgia, under the

name J. H. O'Dell and also served the SÜLC In its New York of-

FIce. In

October, 1962,

several newspaper articles exposed

O'Dell's connection with the scle aid his cormunist affiliations,

THE LONG COMMITTEE

1.

OR CONTAINED

ASSIFIED

FORMATI

HEREIN IS

DATE

The Attorney General called on the morning of

February 27, 1965, to advise he wanted to consult with the

Bureau on certain problems raised by the Long Committee, which

is exploring the use of mail covers, et cetera. He noted there

was a possible problem concerning Chiei Inspector Montague's

testimony and whether it was necessary for Montague to change

his testimony. Also, he felt that Internal Revenue Service had •

been using investigative techniques which they should not use

and this could pose a problem.

He said that the President hed

asked him to coordinate with all executive agencies concerning

the problems raised by the Long Committee.

Inspector Moore and

I net with the Attorney General in

his office

this afternoon.

hir. Courtney Evans was present,

told the Attorney General

that in Montague's testimony he as

told by Attorney Fensterwald that if any of the questions had /^

national security implications Montague should not answer them.

Consequently, hontague was estopped from doing other than answeri

in the negative when asked questions touching on national

¿security.

With this interpretation, it was questionable whether

an attempt should be made to change

or explain Montague's

testimony, particularly in view of the obvious lack of judgment

on the part of Fensterwald and the desire of

rong for publicity.

I made it clear to the Attorney General that from our dealings

with Montague, he was a man of integrity and sacrificed his

personal desires for the welfare of the country and had cooperate

fully with us.

The Attorney General said he had no intention

of changing one word of lontague's testimony, but he was

considering advising Long and Fensterwald that there were

extreme delicate national security matters touching on the areas

being covered by the committee and

•there could be exceptions

Ithe answers given in the testimony when they touched on such

sensitive security matters.

He said further that he contemplates

seeing Senator Long and impressing on him that the comnittee

would not want to stumble by mistake into

an area of extreme

interest to the national security as they

nearly did in a matter

Hemorandum to Mi. Tolson

Re: -The Long Committee

affecting CIA. (Apparently CIA got wind of some inquiries by

the committee relative to their secret operation and

went to

the committee and warned them off.) Katzenbach contemplates

asking for a list of the witnesses who will appear before the

committee together with a brief summary of the expected testimony.

On the basis of this, he will be able to advise Senator Long

when he should steer clear of a sensitive area.

I told Mr. Katzenbach that I certainly agree that this

matter should be controlled at the committee level but that

I felt pressure would have to be applied

so that the personal

interest of Senator Long became involved rather than on any

ideological basis.

Mr. Katzenbach said that he had already

talked to Vice President Humphrey about Fensterwald, who he

considered a wild man, and that Humphrey had promised to talk

to long concerning Fensterwald. Katzenbach said that in

addition to the Vice President he might have to resort to

pressure from the President himself, although he would prefer

to work it out without resorting to

the President.

He indicated

there was no one on the committee itself who could be helpiul

land that he did not expect any help from Senator Lastians

Mir. Katzenbach said that he expected troublefrom the

possible activities of IRS and the military in the investigative

field; that if some of these matters are uncovered before the

committee they will tend to undermine the restricted and

tightly controlled operations of the Burear:.

I told him that

four operations are tightly controlled and particularly in the

delicate areas of

concern, we restrict ourselves to important

security natters.

Mr. Katzenbach said he was going to see Senator Long.

ACTION:

Mr. Katzenbach said he would advise us of the results

of his conversation with Long. He also asked that I advise

the Director of our discussion and I told him I would.

Dear Mike:

• *

The enclosed documents relating to mail inter-

cept programs are submitted for declassification by the

Department of Justice and the FBI. Portions of these docu-

ments which reveal sensitive sources or on-going operations

should be appropriately excised for use at public hearings.

À list of these documents is also attached.

Those documents which are followed by an asterisk on this

list do not appear to be classified, but are nonetheless

included because their contents are

similar in nature to

,those documents which are classified.

These documents should be declassified by

Tuesday, October 14, to allow sufficient preparation time

for the mail hearings, which are now scheduled to begin

on Tuesday, October 21.

sincerely,

• ..

Tos LeInstein. le was, however, included in a list of names

to be removed from the watch list which was prepared on

April 20, 1962 (Exhibit A-2).

b) date - Bernstein was most likely naced on the

watch list in 1959, since he wept to lussia during that year.

On April 20, 1962,

he was included on a list of names to be

renoved from the watch list.

c) basis - Since no Hunter Mail request was located,

there is no background information avallable concerning the

Leonard Bernstein who was placed on the watch list.

A review

travelled to lussia or had any Soviet contacts was

The NIC

was mentioned in a memorandum dated August 28, 1069,

concerning data obtained fron the Hunter Mall' projcat

between January 16, 1969, and August 28, 1969.

No

memorandum concerning results from the Hunter Mail program

commanist.

The source advised that in 1945 Jack Stachel informed

him that Bernstein had agreed to submit to communisi discipline.

This source advised on December 9, 1954 thai he has no direct

personal knowledge of Bernstein's

willingness to submat to

Communist

Ben Davis and Jack Stachel weremembers of the National

Board of the Communist Party who were tried and convioted 1n 1949

for violation of the smith Act of 1940.

On January 15, 1969, Richard Ober; Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), suggested to the

Liaison Agent

that the Bureau should not overlook the utilization of the

Agency's Hunter project for the development of leads in the

New Left and Black Nationalist fields.

Ober admitted the

traffic involving individuals in these areas might be light

but that the Bureau might wish to give consideration to placing

stops on certain key personalities.

The Hunter project for which we have given the

designation of Bureau Informant 200 essentially consists of

specialized coverage of mail between the United States and

If we have some reason to believe that one of our

subject's is communicating with anybody in the soviet Union,

it might be worthwhile to place a stop.

We should bear in mind that this coverage is

extremely sensitive and the handling of any matters involving

which have been established. (See Mary Triplett, extension

RECEIVED

OFFICE OF THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL

The Honorable Edward H. Levi

Attorney General

U.S. Department of Justice

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

29116-13:00

The Select Committee is presently investigating the

activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried

on as part of the COINTELPRO program. We appreciate the

cooperation of the FBI and the Justice Department in

making materials

available to us in this area.

however,

one problem remains to be resolved. The Committee believes

staff must contact and interview certain persons who

received information from the FBI in the course of

COINTELPRO operations.

The FBI has withheld the names of

such persons from the Committee's use on the grounds that

they were FBI "sources"

The Committee wishes to stress that it is not inter-

ested in

questioning these persons about any role as a

"source"

but rather as a recipient of information from

the FBI.

'Indeed, in many instances we would not have been

aware that the individual was a "source" had not the FRI

excised the name from the materials delivered to us.

Nevertheless, to minimize any incidental deleterious effects

on legitimate FBI operations, the Committee has selected a

very limited number of persons whom we desire to contact

and interview. (See attached list and materials.)

As you will recall, we originally discussed this

matter with you some weeks agc.

Since then the Committee

has had an opportunity to consider the issue more fully in

the light of our experience with other investigations.

FOr

example, our inquiry into the relationships between the

FBI and the Internal Revenue Service clearly showed the

- 2-

need to use the names of IPS personnel who cooperated with

the FBI in certain COINTELPRO activities.

Those names

were made available to us for our use.

As I am sure you can appreciate, what is at stake

here is the investigation of serious breaches of the

security and confidentiality of information obtained by

the FBI.

Such information was apparently disclosed or

"leaked" for the purpose of disruption.

The full extent-

of such disclosures in many of the cases, such as the

efforts to discredit Dr. Martin Luther King, JI., is still

unknown. Surely, it would be incongruous for an inquiry

into these matters to be impaired on the grounds of the

FBI's interest in preserving confidentiality.

The Committee has a clear mandate and a firm commit-

ment to investigate allegations that the FBI attempted to

harass and discredit individuals.

The integrity of this

investigation depends upon our ability to conduct inter-

views without the appearance of outside interference.

Therefore, we hope you have no objection to our conducting

the interviews of the persons on the attached list, but if

you do, please contact me by Tuesday, October 21.

Sincerely,

WW 55281

church such as the Unitarian Public forum and the fellowship for

Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-Universalist

Fellowship for

Social Justice.

program against the draft, the war in Vietnam and discrimination

and have proposed.a revolutionary program utilizing armed force,

political

and economic action to obtain their goals.

LA-SNCC is

an arm or the National Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

organization headquartered at Atlanta; Georgia, and with the naming

of LA-SNCE Director RONAID ITROY WILKINS as Deputy Director of SNCC

for the West Coast, the affinity between the National and Local

oxganization will be more

harmonious.

The above source advised that at a meeting of In-SiCC

leaders on Narch 22, 1900, the groud indicated it was necessary

Ior all side personnel to de arned in order to shoot "pig cops

when they are stopped in south Los Angeles.
