Dear Jay:

Your letter makes me feel that I did not

read your manuscript with as nuch insight

or sensitivity

should have brought to it. The fault may be in

part in the manuscript itself, but I feel that I

cannot be altogether absolved

from blame for not under-

standing the intent,

the inner drive of the thing

even if this purpose 1s not fully realized. I feel it

1s not realized, jet I believe, it is there, wrapped

though it may be in detail.

The concept of broadening the study of film,

to use it (as yous say) as à lens for the study of a

country's history and character, is necessary and I

an sure you are well equipped for the task. (rhe horrib-

ly, low level of film history. or criticism in the u. s.,

resting as it does on a phoney aesthetic, has been

to me perhays with some'subiective over-

emphasis) in the treatment of my FILM: THI CRIATIVE

PROCESS-- not merely that so many critics attacked

attacked it without the faintest

of what it is about.

I Leel that your letter states some of the

problems, but also states certain limitations (as I

see it) in your approach. Let me make three points:

first, you speak of'aesthetics" and "sociology:"

"sociology is probably dominant". I feel

there is a danger in this, because it suggests a sep-

aration of the two approaches, and I feel that we

must achieve an integral approach. Marxist thought has

suffered badly in the cultural field from the separa-

tion, and a rather stuify certainty that sociology is.

primary: art in the real is primary, and I think this

the creative realization

of human potentialities 'its misuse and degradation in

societies which are not creative) is

the basis for a

richer approach.

second point: the theme of "treatment of

women," which you mention could, I think,' be

infinitely

more revealing, and more realized in terms of fiin--

and through the a in the nology to at st

it must have more freedon forward and' backward;. but

the frame of reference, the reality of time.

must determine the movement back and forward. The

is; I think, a central factor in

cinema art-- and it! must be so in your nook.

A11: these problens face me in somewhat'
