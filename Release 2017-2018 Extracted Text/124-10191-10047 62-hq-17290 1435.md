Attention:

Mr. Robert L. Keuch

This matter has been coordinated with Legal Counsel

Division which, in turn, has coordinated

with Deputy

Assistant Attorney General

Robert L. Keuch, U. S. Department

of Justice, who has authorized release of the

four specific

documents, in addition to the identification record, to the

former HSCA.

In the context of the documents, it

that two persons on the

"St. Louis Globe Democrat"

in 1968

were utilized by the FBI on a confidential basis in connec

Ion with certain Contelpro operations.

Excisions have

made to protect the identities of these persons, at

least one of

currently affiliated with that paper.

Contact with SAC,

St. Louis, discloses no information to

contravene the confidential relationship discerned in

documents 100-449698-42-1 and 7.

ReBulet to Albany, 5/10/68.

New Left activity in the St. Louis Division is

concentrated in the headquarters city. Principal organizations

involved in this movement are as follows:

Action Committee to Increase Opportunities for Negroes

(ACTION;

Students for Democratic Society (SDS);

St. Louis Draft Resistance (SLDR) ;

The Committee to Support Draft Resistance (CSDR) •

ACTION is basically a racial type organization.

It

consists of a small group of individuals who split from the

St. Louis Chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)

several years ago in belief that CORE was not sufficiently

militant. Its activities are irregular, depending almost

entirely on its chairman, PERCY GREEN.

Communist Party efforts

to cultivate him have so far appeared unsuccessful; however,

some influence is exerted through ORVILLE LEACH, veteran Communist

Party member, who is chairman of the Community Relations Committee

of ACTION.

An immediate Counterintelligence Program concerning

the latter three organizations would be restricted because these .

organizations are all campus-type organizations and Washington

University and St. "Louis University will close for summer

These organizations will

publications in mind which might be suggested for Bureau approval.

The feeding of well chosen information to the St. Louis

Globe Democrat, a local newspaper, whose editor and associate

editor, are extrèmely friendly to the Bureau and the st. Louis

Office, has also been utilized in the past and it is contemplated

that this technique might be used to good advantage in connection

with

this program.

with specific regard to the st. Louis Draft Resistance,

which is a one-man organization headed by RICHARD

VEREER®

a Yashington, University graduate student, the follow

circumstances occurred: MO

FREER turned in his Selective Service draft card at a

public meeting on 12/4/67. Investigation at his local board

determined that a few days later he wrote to the board requesting

a duplicate card.

If this type of information could have been

publicized, it might have pointed out the insincerity of FREER.

to poly a

Nothing, however, was done at the time because of the confidential

nature of draft board records and the fact that publicity may

have jeopardized prosecution presently pending against FREER.

St. Louis will carefully analyze these organizations

under this program in an effort to affect the disruption of the

New Left and specific suggestions of Counterintelligence action

will be submitted to the Bureau

for approval by separate

letter.
