JAMES WILLIAM EGAN states that although he had previously

mentioned demands by ALDERISIO as relating to one-third of

the profits of deal that he, EGAN, and BRAY had with SAM KAY,

this would have actually amounted

to a sum of $200,000 in view

of the terms of their contract with SAM KAY, which specified a

total profit of $600,000 to be received by them.

EGAN states that

he had not consented

to the demands as being made by ALDERISIO,

who explained that he was referring to one-third of entire deal

and not just to a portion of BRAY's share. • EGAN states that

ALDERISIO thereafter specifically commented that he was taking

one-third. of entire deal; that EGAN might as well make up his

mind to this fact inasmuch as "You know we don't use the courts."

EGAN states that demeanor of ALDERISIO during entire period of

meeting was such that there was no doubt in his mind that ALDERISIO

would do absolutely anything necessary to accomplish his purpose

and he, EGAN, was convinced that the sole objective of the meeting

at SAM KAY's office was to let him know that this was the situation.

EGAN states that although no comment was made as to the specific

action that could or would be taken to enforce ALDERISIO's demands,

he was gravely concerned for both his own safety as well as for

that of his daughter, who had been mentioned by ALDERISIO in such

a manner as to indicate that if he cared for her, he would

consent to the demands being made for a one-third share in the

entire deal. EGAN concluded that all of the statements made by

ALDERISIO, as well as the manner in which they were made, were

interpreted by him to have been made for the sole purpose of

letting him know that he would be in danger if he tried to do

anything contrary to ALDERISIO's demands.

ALDERISIO SHOULD BE

DETAILS:

Mr. EDWARD HARRINGTON, Departmental Attorney,

appeared at the Denver Office on January 7, 1964, at which

time he advised Special Agents ARTHUR W. ENGSTROM and PAUL E. +

BUSH that he had been in contact with JAMES WILLIAM EGAN on the

previous date and that during this contact, EGAN had mentioned

for the very first time that the demands previously made by

FELIX ANTHONY ALDERISIO had related to the specific sum of

$200,000. Mr. HARRINGTON stated that in all previous

conversations relating to the demands made by ALDERISIO, EGAN

had indicated that ALDERISIO was demanding a one-third interest

in their South American deal, and for this reason requested

that EGAN be reinterviewed for additional details as to the

specific sum of money now being recalled and mentioned by him.

again at that time

with ALDERISTO's demands. Mr. EGAN stated that ALDERISIO, at

this time, stated that he had made an agreement with BRAY

to

receive a one-third interest in the deal and ALDERISIO added

after ECAN stated he did not believe such an arrangement had

been

effected, that he, ALDERISIO, was there at the time the deal

was made and that he personally believed it.

EGAN stated that there was no doubt in his mind at that

time

that ALDERISIO was serious about demanding a one-third

portion of the whole deal in that he had stated to EGAN that he

might just as well make up his mind to this fact and added that,

"You know we don't use the courts."

ECAN reiterated that this comment by ALDERISIO together

with others which were

made by him frequently and which included:

such statements as "You know who I am! and "You know what I mean!'',

were interpreted by him as implied threats indicating that-

ALDERISIO would do anything that was necessary in order to accom-

plish his purpose. EGAN stated that as a matter of fact,

the

demeanor of ALDERISIO during the entire period of the meeting

was such as to create this impression and he was convinced that

the sole objective of the meeting at 'SAM 'KAY's office was to

let him know that this was the situation.

EGAN pointed out that the matter of his daughter was

not brought into the conversation until

after he had indicated

that he would not consent to ALDERISIO's demands and for this

reason, he was not only gravely concerned for his own safety

but for the safety of his daughter as well. He added that the.

manner in which his daughter had been brought into the conversation

was such that he had to assume that ALDERISIO wanted him to know

that if he cared for her, he would consent to ALDERISIO's

demands for a one-third interest in the entire deal.

ECAN explained further that although no comment had

been made by ALDERISIO as to the specific action that could or

would be taken to influence his demands, ECAN was confident that

ALDERISIO did not want there to be any doubt that he would go

as-far as necessary and that this could, of course, include either

him or his daughter being maimed or killed.

EGAN concluded that based upon his interpretation of

all of the various comments made by ALDERISIO, he had to assume

that the very worst could happen to him and it was for this

reason he had discussed the possibility of being afforded pro-

tection and which request was approved and provided at the direction

of the Departmental Attorneys with whom he had been in close and

frequent contact.
