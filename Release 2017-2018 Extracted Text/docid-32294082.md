SECRED

Of possible significance in this matter is the fact that

Richard and Susan Frank traveled to China sometime between 1959 and

ostensibly with the approval

of the CP, USA. Susan Frank

had been requested to work on the "Peking Review"

and would be

reimbursed by the er of china.

The Franks reportedly also travelea

elsewhere in Europe during

this period.

It should be kept in mind

USA and CP of Canada have frequently exchanged

that the Cry courier and have received instructions from abroad

infornation

possibly be involved in courier activities, if not actually involved

in Cr matters, in the Buffalo area. The possibility should

kept in mind

that someone other than Bernard A. Frank, possibly

Richard Frank, may have been in possession of the vehicle bearing

New York License M55ld at the time it was observed in the Cowan's

drivevay, Toronto, Canada, date not indicated. (s)

Buglo show el the appen act ere the vaster,

ariving the above-mentioned vehicle and submit recommendations as

to further investigation in this re ard.

Additional copies of this communication are being

furnished New York for inclusion in their files on Susan and Richard

Frank.

NOTE:

RCMP has advised that vehicle bearing New York license

Subject

reportedly has been active

facilitated

known conmunists to

obtaining passage to spain for members of the International Brigade

and for obtaining passage for foreign born Canadians returning to

Hungary and other

satellite countries.S New York has advised files

of NYO contain no identifiable information regarding.

Bernard A.

Frank,

and Buffalo has been requested to check its indices.

It is felt

the above additional investigation should be conducted.
