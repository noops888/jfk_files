RE :

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, aka

AR

ReBuairtel to New York captioned "CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE

PROGRAM" 2/15/61.

Miami has advised that JOE BIANCO, owner of Dore's Restaurant

In Dade County, Fla.,

has advised

that although he is acquainted

with LA ROCCA, he received no indication which would tend to

indicate that he was in the Miami locality.

The only piece of

information he was able to furnish related to the fact that

LA ROCCA, in about 1958, was a member of a health

club which

he described as quite large and located in an area not too far

from the University of Pittsburgh.

He recalled that this club

was operated by individuals of Jewish extraction.

Miami, through the COP at Surfside, Fla., and neighbors of

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO on Dickens Ave:, Surfside, were unable

to determine whether LA ROCCA had visited that vicinity during

the months of February and March, 1961, although a maid who

is employed by a neighbor stated that a photo of LA RoccA bore

some resemblance to an individual who stopped at MANNARINO'S

residence during the latter portion of January or early portion

MM 660-C advised that he heard LA ROCCA was in the Miami area

but was unable to locate his temporary residence, motel or hotel.

Spot checks at the aforementioned Dickens Ave. address of

EX 1398RECYO: 92-2940-112

IN VIEW OF THE CONVICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH

INTENT TO KILL AND HIS ARREST FOR CARRYING A CONCEALED

WEAPON, HE MAY BE ARMED AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
