I'1l talk to him and have

Or,

I could send hin

but I'm just trying to

avoid that question

'1f it came up.

I don't think it will, but it's good.

We got to get another witness.

Another one!

And we got to got them before they get then.

You

know who we could get to be &

ALEX:

Who?

HUMPHREYS:

CLAIR.

The reference of ALIX to MONAGHAN

1s probably a

reference to ROBERT I. MONAGHAN, an Assistant United States

Attorney in Chicago.

The reference

to CLINTON

18 & reference to STANFORD CLINTON, who is an attorney in Chicago,

and

who is one of the attorneys representing ANTHONY ACCARDO in

his pending trial.

It is obvious that

the conversation concerns

the trial of ACCARDo,

who has been indicted for fraudulently

charging expenses for the use of his

automobile which he claims

he used to sell "Foxhead Fourhundred" beer for the Premium

Beer Sales, Incorporated.

It is apparent that ALEX and

HUMPHREYS are concerned

with finding witnesses

who will back

up ACCARDO's claim that he used the car during the course

of selling "Foxhead Fourhundred."

The Yorkshire referred

Yorkshire Room Restaurant located

believed to be the

2842 North Sheridan Road

in Chicago.

The reference to STIVE by AlEX midway in the conversation

is probably & reference to StEVE dE kOSTa.

It is noted

that DE KOSTA is ostensibly the ower and manager of the Huckster's

Restaurant in Chicago.

According to PCI|

is intimately friendly with HENRY SUSK

and also well acquainted

with GUS ALEX, the Huckster's is operated
