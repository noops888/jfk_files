NOTE CONTINUED:

The Papich letter and memoranda, and the review of

the 38 possible grievances, contain comments and other intormation

which could have an adverse effect on our current relationshir

with CIA.

While numerous dates have been excised to protect the

identity of individuals, any reader can extrapolate the

approximate time of an event since Papich wrote his 3/13/7

letter following a chronological scheme from 1951 to 1970. There

is some chronological variance in the 3/5/70 letter.

(E) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) - DOMESTIC CONTACT

SERVICE -- You previously have been informed regarding CIA's Contact

Division which has had offices in various U. S. cities and which is openly

identified as being connected with CIA. This division has been responsible

• for the overt collection of positive intelligence gained through interviews of

aliens. travelers, businessmen, etc. The division has not been engaged

in any operational activity such as the development of double agents.

For

your information, CIA has reorganized this division and it is now called

the Domestic Contact Service.

An examination of CIA's activities in the area of overt collection

of positive intelligence has indicated that the Bureau can strengthen its

position by having our field offices establish direct contact with the local

offices of the Domestic Contact Service. This particularly applies to those:

situations where the Bureau and CIA both have an interest in Soviet-bloc

and lugoslav nationals

excluding those who are connected with embassies

or the United Nations. SWe recognize that CIA has a responsibility for

coilection of positive intelligenceli. e. information regarding Soviet-bloc

capability in a particular research field) which might be acquired from

such risitorg hit we rannot condone any CIA activity which might

interfere with Bureau operations. You therefore are authorized to

establish liaison with local offices of the Domestic Contact Service.

In each case when you initiate any inquiry or investigation of a visiting

Soviet-bloc national, you should obtain from the local Domestic Contact

Service the nature and extent of CIA interest and all pertinent information

which CIA has gained or may acquire in the future relating to our internal

security responsibilities. If you feel that CIA activity conflicts with

Bureau objectives, you should so advise the Seat of Government, clearly

setting forth your reasons. In this connection; there may be instances

where continuing CIA pursuit of positive intelligence would conflict with

the Bureau s discharge of its internal security functions.

between the IBI and CIA will provide a basis for promoting further riîus.

This is the lirst thie in our nisuory that such an event has occurred, ar

¡it is difficult to believe that the enemy will not make every effort to

respect for you and our fBI to expose us to a potentially disastrous siti

Although the Denver incident is a blight on the relations ce-

tween the ISI and CId, it would be most unlair of me not to comment on

the dedicated and selfless efforts of nunerous individuals in CIA ho

strived for honest and harmonious relations. As a result of their en-

deavors there have been many services performed in behalf of the Buree

including notable and cutstanding accomplishments.

We have been furnisied

• sources, inforunts, solid proäuctive cases, technical advice and equip

and there have been instances of cooperation nich led to substen-

tial saving of Bureau funds.. There also have been examples of alertness

on the part of CLi employes which prevented Bureau commission of errors

and averted embarrassrent. Anong some of the more significant examnles

of cooperation. I cite the excellent ind badly needed assist-nice of CLA

in the Rudolph doel case. I also refer to the Agency's providing us iün

I only refer to the foregoing to emphasize

director

H CIA

I believe that it would be most helpful to you and

interested Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment

on the attached material if we analyzed very briefly the role

of the Bureau liaison Agent. A liaison Agent can be a simple

mail courier or he can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confront

any problem of issue with anotheragency, very often working mith

very limited information. .It is expected that the Bureau Agent

carry out his instructions forcefully and efficiently. He must

be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various

conditions.

He must be alert for pitfalls and express himself

in a most judicious and prudent manner but always making certain

that the Bureau position is well fortified.

In evaluating the attached and my encounters with CIA,

it should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were

easy to handle because the Agent had J. Edgar Hoover behind him.

However, when an Agent struck at san official on one day and

solicited his cooperation the next day, it did require some

resourceful action. It is believed that other liaison Agents

regularly encounter similar situations. On numerous occasions

I have bittorly feuded with CIA officials and this has included

rough language.

I have walked out on CIA officials when I felt

they were unreasonable.

They took the initiative by asking the

Agent to return. I did try to play fairly and squarely with all

of them and never hesitated to accept a confrontation; this include

the Director of the Agency. When 'I lectured to CIA personnel

over the years

• I always made a point to challenge them to present

any grievances or raise any subject matter relating to the

• Bureau.

I never left a discussion with any CIA official without

"being positive that our position was absolutely understood.

The approaches utilized by me might be open to criticism.

I

can only refer, to the records of the Bureau and CIA and I believe

the Bureau's position is most favorable. I don't think CIA has

ever transmitted a letter of protest to the Bureau during the

eighteen years during which the Agent handled the assignment.

(1) MOCASE. (THE BORIS MORROS CASE)

cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly

of Soviet operations in this country and abroad. We

did not disseminate any iniormation of significance

In this case until 1954. On various occasions when

the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu

ments with CIA officials, they have seen fit to raise

this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to

cooperate with the Agency. The position taken by CIA •

was that it should have been advised regarding the

Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,

claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity

to develop more information of significance, identify

Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for

recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. He did

not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the

extreme sensitivity of the case.

We actually did not

permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to

the MOCASE until 1957.

..

In 1957, CIA complained that it certainly had

every right to have received the information earlier

because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA

employees and operations. CIA further argued that it

had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out

the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the

Agency at the same time that the case was publicized.

The Agency argued that the failure of the Bureau to

coordinate with CIA those French aspects of the case

permitted the French, rather than the U.S., to play a

dominating role in Europe.

with regard to dealing with the French, we

took the position that we would cover the leads through

our Legal Attaches wherever possible and to furnish

Legal Attaches.

Cis maintained that since we were on

record that our Legal Attaches do not handle operations

abroad, the gureau had an obligation to levy those French

leads

on CIA or at least. coordinate with the Agency

before going to the French.

It is to be noted that in any argument relating

to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA will fall back on the

responsibilities placed on the Agency under the provisions

of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation

of the foregoing through National security Council Direc-

tives. CIA will maintain that' it is incumbent upon the

Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security

Act of 1947 and the Directives. The Agency would argue

that in the MOCASE. these were ignored by the Bureau.

(3) THE ABEL CASE

Although CIA has not raised the point for

several years, the prevailing attitude was, and probably

still exists,

that the FBI did not play it square with

CIA in the abel case by not making certain that the

Agency was given the proper recognition for its contri-

butions.

CIA feels that in the first place, there would

not have been any U. S. access or availability to the

to this as an instance of very unfair conduct on the part

of the Bureau.

(6) BUREAU HANDLING OF CIA REQUESTS FOR TOURS

FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS

On occasions in the 1950's,

CIA complained that

officials visiting the U. S. under CIA sponsorship were

given excellent treatment on the tour but, nevertheless,

many of the visitors left most disappointed because they

had not had

any contact with any Bureau officials.

CIA

felt that contact with Bureau officials had very significant

benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of

the FBI's world-wide reputation.

CIA also pointed out that

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,

they were left with the suspicion that there was some kind

of friction between the FBI and CIA..

In 1956, we had a

clear-cut policy to the effect that

tours for

such visi

tors would be of a restrictive nature in that such

visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the

public and nothing more.

CIA was so informed but

periodically indicated

that our policy prevented the

Agency from truly enhancing U. S. interests abroad.

CIA never lodged an official complaint.

It should beemphasized that for the past several

years there would not be any basis for any formd complaint

with regard to Bureau treatment of foreign officials coming

to the U. S. under CIA sponsorship. The personal attention

last several years, it is not believed that there is

any basis for complaint since we have regularly been

notifying CIA concerning subjects of cases who travel

abroad.

If the legal attache is investigating, ClA is

notified in order to avoid duplicate eftorts.

There

have been exceptions where we have taken the position

that CIA should not be notified betause of the sensitivity

of the matter. How many such exceptions are known to

CIA cannot be established Irom our Intes; however, we

should bear in mind that when out legal Attaches inves.

tigate, they contact many of the same foreign officials

normally contacted by CIA.

How many of these foreign

officials are CIA informants, or on the Agency payroll,

is unknown.

(11) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN CUBA

: We operated informants in Cuba when we had a

Legal Attache's Office in Havana. Informants reported

on activities of communists and other subversives in

that country. During the period we operated these

informants, we did not coordinate our operations with

CIA.

We did not advise the Agency that we had such

sources. However, in 1960, after Castro

came on the

scene, it became infeasible to handle certain informants

in a secure manner: Approval was granted to turn certain

informants over to CIA. What these informants may have

subsequently told CIA about past Bureau operations is

unknown.

This item is being cited in the event CIA bad

evidence to establish that we had been operational in

Cuba and had not coordinated with the Agency pursuant

to Directives.

In September, 1965, we received information

Indicating that oneof our informants on the Mexican border

was in a position to travel- to Cuba. A question was raised

concerning CIA interest in this matter, if the informant

made the trip.

It was recommended and approved that we

not advise CIA concerning the identity of the informant

or his trip to Cuba.

It is not known if CIA acquired any knowledge

but, if the agency did, we potentially are vulnerable.

The Agency could charge that we were operating outside

of the U.S. and we failed to coordinate with the agency.

(20) DISSEMINATION OF CIA INFORMATION IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH

By letter dated May 5, 1965, we disseminated to

interested agencies, including CIA, a copy of a monograph

entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic." The mono-

graph contained considerable information which had emanated

from. CIA.. He did not obtain clearance from CIA for

the inclusion ofthis information in our monograph.

Clearance approval was not obtained because of the

urgency of the document. CIA was irritated because

it considered our action a distinct violation of the

third agency rule. The Agency never made any protest.

whereby the Bureau would be permitted to run the informant

In the second instance, we established an

agreement with CIA in October,

1967, that we could con-

tinue handling an informant in PLAcE: with the under-

standing that the Bureau Agent, on the occasion of each

visit,

would cenfer with the local CIA office on political

information collected trom the intormant.

These two cases

had all the makings of a conflict. CIA was under the

definite impression that we had been running these

iniormants before we had finally coordinated with them.

It is true that the CIA Chief in PLACE

was much

incensed but. no issue was made at CIA Headquarters and

thematter was put to rest.

CIA may have developed concrete evidence that

we were operating in PLACE bearing in mind that in

a place such as

for a CIA intelligence officer to spot an FBI Agent in

CURRENT SENSITIVE OPERATION -

(23) HARRASSIENT OF CIA

By letter dated November 15, 1967, CIA inquired

If the Bureau would check the toll calls on the bome

telephone of one NAME

who was harrassing

CIA in the Miami area. NAMe allegedly was seeking

information concerzing the Agency's covert operations.

•He told CIA that we would not check the toll-calls.

We

explained that on the basis of the information received,

there was not sufficient information to justify investigation

falling within theBureau's

our response but there is no doubt that treagency

characterized our position as

a concrete example of

refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating

to the security of U. S: intelligence operations.

(24)

SENSiTiVE DOCUMENT

CIA became very irked when ve restricted

dissemination of our SENSITIVE DOCUMENT

to

two copies for thé Agency. CIA took the position with

• the Liaison Agent: that CIA always has been most liberal

in providing the Bureau with as many copies as we needed

when it involved various types of CIA material. The

Agency never made an Official issue of this matter. The

Haison Agent is confident that CIA almays considered this

an uncooperative gesture on our part.

establishing a Legal

The

purpose of the assignment was to follow Bureau leads in

Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Holland. We did not inform

operation and did not relate to any operational activity

abroad, CIA again surrendered. The Agency could argue

that it was responsible for following Soviet matters

with the fiEld intelligence Service and that we had an

obligation of coordinating with the agency.

(27) TITLE OF BOOK

In August,

1963, we received information indi-

cating that

"I see no reason doing so."

It is not known if CIA was aware of the contact

with the Bureau.

subsequently published the

book which contained extremely derogatory information

concerning CIA.

(28) COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES - AFRICA

In April, 1960, CIA inquired if the Bureau would

give any consideration to assisting the Agency toward

developing coverage in Africa.

CIA was looking for the

services of any Negro informant who might be available.

The Agency also inquired about placing a Negro in the

Communist Party, USA, under a plan which would have as

an eventual objective, the sending of the informant to

Africa under an appropriate cover and for an extended

period.

We told CIA we had no informants available

because they were necessary for our own operations. We

took the position that we saw no benefit to be gained by

loaning an informant on a short or long term basis.

This item is being mentioned because Africa

has become vitally important to US. interest, bearing

In mind that both the Soviets and Chinese Communists have

made significant inroads into the area.

CIA could argue

that as early as 1960, it had the foresight to recognize

the need for additional coverage, that it appealed to the

Bureau for assistance, and that we did not cooperate.

;

(29) ADVISING THE WHITE HOUSE REGARDING CRITICISM

OF INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS - EUROPE

By letter dated October 23, 1964, we furnished

the White House information received by our Legal Attache

from the

SOURGE

He was critical

of intelligence operations in Europe and made particular

reference to the overstaffing of personnel.

We do not know if. CIA became cognizant of the

existence of the Bureau letter bearing in mind that the

Agency undoubtedly would have considered the document as

relating to. its operations. We do knöw that for several years,

CIA personnel have been assigned to the White House and had

access to considerable information.

(30) THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE ADVISORY

BOARD AND JOHN MC CONE

In bay, 1963, we became embroiled with CIA in a

rather critical conflict as a result of communication the

' Bureau sent to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory

Board.

The matter dealt with consideration that might be

given to increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishnents.

In a portion of our communication, we attributed cer-

tain information to icCone, then Director of CIA. He

charged that the information attributed to hin was not

so because he. had never made any such statement and he

could prove it.

The actual fact was that the information

subordinates who had indicated that the information.

should have checked with him before we went on record

that any information had. originated with him.

The

record at the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory

Board was subsequently corrected.

(31) ALLEGED PENETRATIONS OF CIA

In February, 1965, Bureau representatives met

with ciA officials and with

allegations nade by NAME

to alleged Soviet penetrations of CIA. NAME

was

interviewed in detail concerning these allegations.

By

letter dated February 26, 1965, ne officially advised CIA

that there appeared to be no basis at this time for a

full investigation of the individuals involved.

There are off cials in CIA who continue to be

seriously concerned about possible penetrations of the

• Agency and have not discarded NAME'S allegations.

He do not have any reason to believe that CIA

has developed any substantive evidence to support NAME'S

allegations.

If it does, we could be vulnerable and could

be charged that we did not cooperate and conduct the

necessary investigation in 1965.

(32) VICE PRESIDENT NIXON'S TRIP TO SOUTH AMERICA - 1958

In 1958, Vice President Richard M. Nixon traveled

to Latin America during which time there were numerous riots

and attacks which were directed against the Vice President

jand his party: By letter dated May 16, 1958, we provided

the Vice President with a summary of information which we

had received concerning the events in Latin America relating

to the trio.

Most of this information came from CIA.

Our letter could be interpreted as raising the question

concerning the quallty of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

•It is not known if CIA ever became knowledgeable

of the referenced communication. As already indicated

we do know that CIA personnel have been assigned to the

White House. We also know that ' NAME

CIA, was attached to Vice

President Nixon's staff.

If CIA is cognizant of the communication, the

Agency technically could raise a question concerning a

violation of the third agency rule and, furthermore,

could question the Bureau's propriety of making reference

to CIA's coverage in Latin America..

(33) . NAME OF SUBJECT

The captioned individual is a criminal infor-

mani whom we have been utilizing to very significant advan-

tage in New York City. He has been the source of valuable

criminal intelligence

and has been a key witness in

prosecutions of cases being handled by the Bureau.

We

operator in New York City had become acquainted with

was interested. Negotiations were initiated and we

subsequently acquired the services of NAMe Although

the Agency has never officially made any statement to us,

it has been bitterly disappointed that the Bureau never

acknowledged CIA's assistance which the Agency considered

extremely valuable.

(34) EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORHATION

with regard to the exchange of technical information with

Cia, particularly as it related to the technical surveillance

field. CIA exhibited its equipment to us but, for many years,

me declined to show any of our devices, with some exceptions.

CIA

never made any official protest but informally

indicated from time to time that the lack of exchange

in this highly important field was prejudicial to over-

all intelligence and internal security interests. The

Agency implied that we actually were more open with the

British in this general area than we were with CIA.

It should be noted that the foregoing situation

does not exist today. There is good

exchange between the

Bureau and CIA.

(35)

CIA LECTURERS AT BUREAU TRAINING SCHOOLS

•

CIA has never been able to understand why the

Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to lecture at Bureau

schools or training courses.

CIA has felt that through

a careful selection of lecturers, the Agency could make

a very valuable contribution boch to the Bureau and to

CIA. The Agency has indicated that its participation in

some of our courses would give the Agency the opportunity

to describo CIA's organiantion, objootiveo, and opcrational.

problems. Furthermore, it has

been expressed that Bureau

personnel could be given the opportunity to pose questions

and there would be a far better over-all orientation on

the part of our people.

The Liaison Agent has always resisted CIA's

request.

It has been a delicate matter to handle because

Bureau personnel have lectured to hundreds of CIA employees.

(36) EXCHANGE IN THE TRAINING FIELD

Although CIA has never officially made an issue

of the matter, the Agency has not been happy about our

attitude concerning exchange of information in the training

field. When the matter has been broughtup for any discussion

by CIA, the Agency has been discouraged.

CIA informally has

expressed the feeling that an exchange along certain guide-

lines could be most useful to the U. S. intelligence and

internal security effort.

(37) POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE

(S)

This is an area where discussion with CIA

officials can rapidly generate criticism of the Bureau

• •

for failure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis-

tance.

Positive intelligence, briefly, is that information

which might assist the U. S. Government in formulating

foreign policy.: Much' of it is of a political nature. and

a vital portion pertains to scientific developments, military

capabilities of foreign countries, and intentions of foreign

countries.

Positive intelligence is rot only important

as it concerns the connunist-bloc countries but also

the son-bloc nations.

There never has been,

any'la?, Directive, of

Executive Order which has fixed the responsibilities for

the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in

the U.S.

The Bureau does have a responsibility which

we refer

to as internal security and which falls into the

accepted area of counterintelligence. He do investigate

subversives spys, and we develop penetrations of foreign

intelligence services.

Our work in the positive intelli

gence field, for the most part, has been restricted to

the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the State .

Departnent, usually when a political crisis occurs in

some country.

• CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous

unexplored

technical surveillance coverage, development of informants,

and collection of cryptographic material. CIA does not

feel that we have aggressively moved ou this particular

subject and that over the years, the agency has been

thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem.

In DATE :

, CIA requested the Bureau to

Install technical surveillances at the offices and temporary

residences of two FoREIGN Government officials visiting the

U.S. Pursuant to instructions, CIA was told to seek the

authority of the Attorney General. The Director stated

that he did not want CIA utilizing FBl as a channel.

On October 21, 1969, we told CIA that future

requests from. CIA fon technical surveillance coverage

should be transmitted by the Agency directly to the

attorney General.

CIA has never made any official comment or

protest but it has considered the afore-mentioned action

by the Bureau as unfriendly and uncooperative. The Agency

has looked to the Bureau

as the logical point of contact and

as the only organization having the besources and capabilities

of adequately determining if such coverage is even feasible.

(38) MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

The Liaison Agent recalls fragments of other

situations or conflicts which occured over the years and

which resulted in the voicing of

CIA displeasure or criticism.

The Agent cannot recall the names of the cases which is

necessary to acquire the required data. There was one

Instance early in the 1950's which involved information

received from a source of unknown reliability charging

Allen Dulles with having been a communist and a spy while

1n Europe.: He disseminated the information to several

agencies. Dulles exploded but never lodged a protest.

The Agent also has recollection of instances when

CIA alleged that its source or informant was compromised by

Bureau revelation of CIA iniormation during the course of

interviews conducted by us.

rechnically, this would be a

violation of the third agency rule and, if CIA had hard

core facts, we would be vulnerable, particularly if an

Important informant was lost.

CIA never made any official

issue or protest.

Honorable Richard Helms .

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Helms:

As I am sure you will agree, the need for close

coordination of the intelligence-gathering ansfcounter-

Intelligence

efforts of the FBI and the Central

Intelligence

Agency (CIA)

is self-evident. This matter is one which

requires a continuing analysis to assure that both agencies

have established working agreements whereby we can most

•effectively realize positive results with a mininum of

duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of the CIA to consider coordina-

• tion of our mutual efforts in the collection of positive

Intelligence in the United States. Ag a result of these

conferences, a set of ground rules was drawn up and agreed

to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted

•In my letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director

Vice Admiral William F. Reborn, Jr. A copy of the agreement

is enclosed for your information. This agreement has proven

generally effective and no major problems have been

encountered since its adoption in the areas it covers.

The FBI has primary responsibility with regard to

matters involving the internal security of the United States

as well as for conducting counterintelligênce operations in

this country. While

this Bureau does not have any statutory

responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign

Intelligence, I have always recognized that the potential

for the development of such intelligence in this country 1s

considerable.

The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort

to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.

-: Intelligence agencies, including the CIA, and policy making

officials of the Government. While these efforts have,

of course, been incidental to our main internal security

and counterintelligence responsibilities, we have on a

selective basis developed sources, both live and technical,

providing coverage at key foreign establishments in the

United States. The product of this coverage has been furnished

on & regular basis to the CIA and other interested agencies

and officials of the Goverment.

I know that you will share my belief that this

matter requires a periodic reexamination to assure that the

national security interegts continue.to be served in the

most effective and complete manner possible. After reviewing

this matter, Including the attached 1966 agreement, I would

welcome any observations you may desire to make.

sincerely yours,

PLACE

Although Agent Papich did not begin handling Liaison

with CIA until 1952, it is important to refer to highly signi-

ficant differences with CIA which culminated in a serious

conflict in the Fall of 1951. Our Legal Attaches in PLAGE

and pLACE reported that CIA representatives were attacking the

Bureau, were endeavoring to place us in an unfavorable light,

were questioning our jurisdiction, and were making disparaging

remarks

- concerning the Bureau. Some of this was summed up by

characterizing it as covert hostility within CIA, stenning

largely from disgruntled former employees of the

FBI.

In October, 1951, General Walter Beddil Smith, then

Director of CIA, asked to meet with. the Director and other

Bureau representatives for the purpose of discussing the

General Smith denied that there was any

covart hostility agrinet. the Bureau and maintained that there

was a general feeling of respect for us.

He admitted that

there had been isolated instances of frictivn fui thion CIA

must accept its share of responsibility:

It is my recollection that the Director and other

- Bureau officials did meet with General Smith, at which time

guidelines were set forth for maintaining future relations

between the two agencies. I was not able to find a memorandum

of record covering this meeting.

?. PROSELYTING OF BUREAU PERSONNEL BY CIA

The Agent clearly recalls that early in the 1950's

te encountered difficulties with CIA because the Agency allegedly

was recruiting Bureau-employed personnel. He vigorously pro-

tested, and subsequently, the Agency advised that it would follow

& policy of not having any contact with a Bureau employee until

the Individual had been separated from the Bureau for a period

of at least thirty days.

The Agent could not locate the back-

ground of this matter in the files reviewed by him. It is pos-

sible that the pertinent information lies in the personnel file

of some former Bureau Agent.

CIA USE OF BUREAU INFORMATION IN

A U:S. INTELLIGENCE BOARD DOCUMENT

On Narch 30, 1961, the Liaison Agent contacted

Allen Dulles concerning .CIA's failure to obtain Bureau clearance

for use of our information in a U.S. Intelligence Board document.

No known damage had been done, but the Agent stressed the sensi

tivity of the Bureau information. Dulles requested one of his

subordinates to establish a procedure to prevent a recurrence

of such errors.

amendments made by Helms included exemptions from certain

provisions of the Bill for FBI, CIA, and the National Security

Agency.

These amendments were

suggested by CIA without prior

consultation with the Bureau.

The Director made the notation,

"this precumatunus artion of

Helmal le actrunding.

-:"

• 71. CIA COVERAGE OF BUREAU LEADS

Historically, CIA's coverage of Bureau leads had

been decidedly spotty from the standpoint of delivering

satisfactory content and servicing the leads within a reasonable

period of time. It would be necessary to revier hundreds, if

not thousands, of files to document what we consider delays in

following our leads. It should

be noted that CIA, organizationally,

has never maintained an atmosphere of discipline in any may

comparable to that of the Bureau. Matters are not followed

as promptly and responsibility is not firmly fixed. This

evaluation is made

in light of standards followed by the Bureau.

He continually prod and push CIA for responses. To develop all

of the evidence to explain these delays would require an inspection

of CIA operations. CIA has given the following types of responses:

hazards of adverse operating conditions in backward countries;

limited personnel; undue exposure to hostile intelligence, police,

and security services; pressures placed on the agency on priority

SERET

targets quite often dealing with political crises in foreign

countries.

Although CIA has not ventured to emphasize the

point, it

is believed that in many instances it has not pro-

duced

satisfactorily and efficiently because of the absence

of reliable sources.

72. LACK OF PROPER ORIENTATION OF BUREAU

RESPONSIBILITIES AND JURISDICTION

Although there has been decided improvement in

recent years, the Liaison Agent continues to note a definite

Jack of knowledge of FBI responsibilities and jurisdiction on

the part oI cia employees.

They do receive some

training in

this regard, but the impression is left that such training

could be

much more extensive. 'The Bureau's Liaison Agent has

lectured to hundreds of CIA

employees in the last few years

and this has produced significant signs

of concrete benefits.

CIA employees encountered the Liaison Agent on a very regular

basis and asked questions pertaining to our responsibilities.

Nevertheless, there is room for much improvement.

73. CIA POLICY REGARDING DISSEMINATION TO OUR LEGAL ATTACHES

There has been a sore spot in connection with CIA

policy relating to its dissemination oi information at a locai

level in our embassies(s) This policy allegedly has applied to

all other agencies and includes our Legal Attaches. CIA has

maintained that

unless the information it develops or receives

is in the immediate jurisdiction of a particular agency, it

will only disseminate at the Seat of Government.. As an

example,

If CIA received information concerning the existence of a U.S.

criminal fugitive in a foreign country, it would disseminate

to the Legal:Attache.

74 SOME PAST HISTORY WHICH IS VERY RELEVANT

•

When evaluating our relationship with CIA, including

our grievances, it is believed that we cannot overlook the

relevancy of the serious differences we experienced with the

Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. The

seeds leading to the establishment of CIA came from OSS.

WAME AND

• CHAPACTERIZATION

has been referred to as the

"CHARAGTERIZAT"

There were instances when OSS blatantly ignored FBI

jurisdiction and failed to coordinate on numerous matters.

There

was a number of CIA officials who obviously had a definite dislise

for the Bureau. The loose administration of OSS, its employuen:

of known subversives, its alleged penetration by

the Soviets,

and its attitude toward the Russian Government at the time posec

serious problems to the Bureau.. At one point OSS was actually

giving serious consideration to establishing liaison with the

28-

T477.

1H 55036 DocId: 32989616 Page 81-

## Page 82

NKVD. Because

a substantial number of OSS officials subsequently

became important figures within CIA, it would be logical to

assume that the FBI was justified in being most prudent, if not

circumspect, in dealings with the Agency.

When evaluating its position in 1970, the Bureau

rightfully cannot forget the troubles with oss.

At the same

time, it would be most unwise if we neglected to examine the

role

played-by the Bureau when we disbanded our SIs operations

coverage in Latin America.

lend themselves to the preparation of a series of about six

DECIASSIFIED BY

0n 4/2

Reference my memorandum 3/25/70 concerning letter 3/20/70

from CIA Director Helms. In letter, Helms expresses full agreement

with Director's view that intelligence collection efforts of FBI and CIA

must be closely coordinated and that periodic reappraisal of such efforts

is required. He has invited Director's desires as to how such reassessments

can be best conducted. He refers to 1966 conference between Bureau and

CIA representatives, which resulted in agreement covering certain phases of

• intelligence collection, and suggests additional discussions at this time.

Helms hac listed nine specific areas for possible discussion at

conference between Bureau and CIA. He states he would sincerely welcome

Director's observations on his proposed agenda. Specific items listed by

Helms are set forth hereinafter together with my observations.

1. Electronic Surveillance Coverage (Elsurs)

Helms notes Bureau has been receptive in past to requests for

this type coverage and has capability and experience in this field which cannot

be duplicated by any other U.S. agency. Helms refers to October, 1969,

CIA request for elsur coverage of two FoREIGNERs ; visiting U.S., one of

whom had KGB connections. Bureau advised CIA at that time that it should

refer such requests directly to Attorney General (AG) for approval. Helms

suggests question of such coverage be reopened between FBI and CIA

representatives, adding that this coverage should be rigidly controlled.

Comment: We have always been highly selective in our use of

elsurs, particularly during recent years in view of sensitive nature of this

type coverage, legal considerations, and manpower commitments. CIA:

which has no prosecutive responsibilities may not understand the Bureau's

position in this matter or need for great selectivity but I do not feel Director .

should modify stand taken in October, 1969, that CIA should seek approvai

directly from AG. Helms' point that no other U.S. agency has capability of

FBI in this field may have merit and when CIA can first clearly justify reques==

course, would be judged on its own merits. But there should be no change in

our October, 1969, vosition that CIA must first get approval for such coverage

from AG

Trans Inton's view. #

2. Mail Coverage

Helms cites importance of this as intelligence tool, which has

been proven in past. He has impression it has been discontinued and suggests

• FBI-CIA representatives confer to determine whether such coverage could be

used with regard to investigations of Soviet blos, New Left, and foreign agents.

Comment: In line with Director's instructions, we have discontinue

• this coverage in recent years. We know that other Federal agencies, including

Army and CIA, utilize this type coverage frequently and often with success

such as we experienced ourselves in the past. Eoth Army and CIA regularly

make available to us results of their coverage abroad concerning individuals

of interest to Bureau. This type coverage is sensitive and Helms has not

spelled out specifically what CIA may have in mind here. This type coverage

is too sensitive to be discussed in written correspondence. I recommend

Let unti

that we seek further information in direct discussions with CIA before

tho

deciding on our course of action. Of course no commitments of any kind

will be made and all issues raised will be referred to the Director for a

it"

decision.

3.

CIA Technical Services

Helms calls attention to recent tecinical and scientific equipment

recently developed by CIA in the counterintelligence field ( SENSITEVE

METHODS

). He inäcates willingness to share

such equipment and developments with Bureau and indicates he would welcom

suggestions as to how súch equipment can be better employed.

Comment: While it is not likely CIA has developed equipment of

this type which is not already known to FBI Lacoratory and while some of

RE: RELATIONS WITH

4 Courses in Positive Intelligence Requirements and Reporting

Helms offers to make available to us training courses in positive

intelligence for purpose of discussing in depth theneeds of the intelligence

community, including CIA.

Comment: I see no need for this at this time. We have a highly

effective and comprehensive training program for our Agents in security work

and I see no necessity for training lectures by CIA personnel. We regularly

receive from CIA copies of the Current Intelligence Reporting List which out-

lines priorities and requirements of other U.S. intelligence agencies in particu-

lar areas of positive intelligence. These Lists are reviewed by appropriate

supervisors at SOG and are then furnished on regular basis to interested field

offices. If any new developments occur in this field, we can always reconsider

if we wish. But as stated there is no need at this time. i.

5. Seminars on Opposition Services

Helms suggests that FBI and CIA specialists concerning hostile

- intolligence services meet as needed to keep abreast of new develmpments

and patterns on part of hostile intelligence agencies. He feels such

discussions should provide an opportunity to possibly devise new means to

penetrate or neutralize enemy forces.

Comment: I do not believe there is any need for conferences of

type referred to by Helms except on an infrequent basis. Of course, where

special circumstances warrant and provided such conferences are tightly

controlled by Bureau and specifically approved by Director there would be

no reason to object to them per se.

6. Live Bloc Sources

Helms refers to prior cooperation between FBI and CIA in handling

of communist bloc defectors and penetration agents but expresses belief there

is room for improvement in establishing more uniform exploitation of these

sources. He invites Director's suggestions for better coordination and evalua-

tion of live source information.

Comment: Our 1966 conferences and agreement with CIA were

ment has proven effective.as.Helms. agrees. Iam not aware of any need for

8 Live Sources in Non-Bloc Area

Helms points out diplomatic sources in this area, especially

critical Middle East and Latin-American fields, could provide much needed

intelligence. He urges the full potential of this area be explored by repre-

sentatives of both agencies.

Comment: This is very similar to previous point (6) and again

involves 1966 agreement. I think our approach should be the same; namely:

while we are not aware of any problems in this area we could listen to any

proposals CIA has to make and, of course, we would refer them to the Direcic=

prior to taking any action.

New Left and Racial Matters

Helms notes that there is already a substantial exchange of infor-

mation in this area and cites close connections between subversive elements

in U.S, and abroad. He suggests we consider how we can best empiny our

respective menoves lu meet this threat which is intorational in scone.

Comment: We have carefully reviewed this situation and.feel CLA

and black estremisis while traveling abroad and additional data concerning

foreign funding or support of subversive activities in U.S. We furnish a

great deal of information to CIA regarding foreign aspects of the extremist

movement developed through our investigations. As to manpower commitmen-s.

our own use of manpower is, of course, under constant review. There are

heavy manpower demands on FBI in a host of areas (organized crime, civil

rights, applicant investigations, etc.) outside the security field.

I woulate

definitely opposed to any discussions with CIA involving the allocation of manpower

by either agency. This is a matter for each agency to decide in its own besi

interests andiudgment.

Relations With Domestic-Field Offices and Legal Attaches

Helms expresses belief there are no serious conflicts in this area

but there may be room to improve quality of liaison so as to expand intelli-

gence collection eitorts, particularly in view of changing conations both here

and abroad.

Comment: As indicated, Helms does not perceive any serious prs-

blems in this area either in U.S. or abroad. Our policy has always been ira:

trative control. I feel that we should adhere strictly to our long-standing policy

in this connection and I see

no need for discussions with CiA on this issue.

RECOMVENDED REPLY TO HELMS:

I do not believe the Director should seek to furnish detailed

observations regarding the Bureau's position o the various matters suggested

by Helms. Many of them are quite sensitive audi complex and there is nothing

to be gained by spelling out the Director's views in writing on such matters.

Accordingly, I recommend that a general reply be sent to Helms indicating

our willingness to meet with CIA representatives for direct discussions on

those points which merit further elaboration or where we might at least be

willing to listen to any CIA proposals.

Bearing in mind specific observatics set forth above, I think

our reply to Helms should show we are amenable to direct conferences with

ICIA on certain of these issues but we should inficate we see nothing to be

(4) Courses in Positive Intelligence Requiremats and Reporting;

(5) Seminars on Opposition Services; (8) New Left and Racial Matters;

regard to the other points, any discussions with CIA would be strictly within

current policies laid down by the Director anino commitments would be

made by Bureau representatives. All matters requiring a decision which

might arise would be reterred to the Director fr a decision.

If the Director desires,

Honorable Richard Helms

Director

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington,, D. C.

Dear Mr. Helms:

CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO

DECLASSIFICATION AND/OR,

RELEASE OF CIA INFORIMATION

IN THIS DOCUMENT. K P4/8/98

DECLASSIFIED BY 5668 StOlECL

011_2-9-98 (27K)

I have carefully reviewed your letter of March 20 setting

out your observations with respect to various matters of mutual interest.

I certainly appreciate your kind comments concerning me and i share

your convictions as to the need for close coorcination of our intelligence

collection activities in behalf of the national security.

.

•Your letter suggested nine particular areas which might be

the subject of further discussions aimed at improving the coordination of

our operations. A number of these topics are highly sensitive and complex

and I will therefore make no effort here to set forth my views in detail.

However, in response to your letter and as a prelude to any direct discus-

sions on these matters, certain observations on my part may be appropriate.

With regard to electronic surveillance and mail coverage,

there is no question as to the frequent value of such operations in develop-

ing needed intelligence. On the other hand, the use of these measures in

domestic investigations poses a number of problems which may not be

• encountered in similar operations abroad. There is widespread concern

by the American public regarding the possible misuse of this type coverage.

Moreover, various legal considerations must be borne in mind, including

the impact such coverage may have on our numerous prosecutive responsi-

bilities. The FBI's effectiveness has always depended in large measure on

but capacity to retain the full,confidence of the American people. The use

of any investigative measures which infringe on traditional rignts of privacy

must therefore be scrutinized most carefully. Within this framework, however,

I would be willing to consider any proposals your Agency may mate:

HH 55036 DocId: 32989616 Page 91

---

## Page 92

Your offer to make available certain technical equipment

developed by the Agency is most welcome and I fully reciprocate your

willingness to cooperate in the exchange of relevant scientific data.

i am prepared to designate appropriate representatives of the FBI

Laboratory to meet with CIA technical personnel at any mutually

convenient time.

With respect to the inclusion of positive intelligence courses

in our training curricula, I am sure you will recognize that our training

programs must be designed primarily to fulfill our own widespread and

demanding responsibilities. While I appreciate your offer, I do not

feel it would be feasible at this time to include the proposed courses

in our training schedules. I would certainly have no objection to the

holding of seminars between specialists of our two agencies in selective

areas of interest when justified by specific circumstances.

Concerning the coordination of FBI-CIA activities in the

exploitation of live sources, both in the communist bloc field and with regard

to key nonblos establishments, I am not aware of any significant problems.

The 1966 agreement between our agencies was concerned directly with this

question and i have no changes to suggest in the ground rules at this time.

However, In the event your Agency has some specific proposals to male,

I would welcome bearing further from you in this connection.

There is already a considerable exchange of information

between our agencies concerning New Left and racial extremist matters.

Frequently, as you have pointed out, there have been substantial connections

between subversive and extremist elements in the United States and their

counterparts abroad. We will continue to furnish your Agency information

being developed by the Bureau which might have a bearing on your

intelligence requirements. At the same time, we are definitely in need of

additional information from your Agency as to the foreign aspects of the

extremist movement in the United States, including foreign funding and

support of local extremist organizations. While I do not believe there is

any need for detailed aiscussions on this point, if you have any specific

suggestions to make we would be pleased to consider them..

WN 55036. Docid: 32989616 Page 92

## Page 93

Similarly, I am not aware of any major problems which exist

at this time in connection with the coordination of our field liaison

operations.. It has been my long-standing policy that serious questions

affecting the coordination of our activities with other Government

agencies should be hanaled and controlled at a headquarters level in

order to avoid administrative confusion and misunderstanding.

in line with my letter of March Il and the observations

contained in your letter of March 20, I will in the immediate future

designate appropriate officials of the Bureau to meet with your representatives

for detailed discussions of these matters. It is my earnest hope that such

conferences will lead to a sharpened understanding of the responsibilities

and objectives of our respective agencies and will serve to promote more

effective cooperation in our joint commitment to the national intelligence .

indicated that a A would like to direct initial attentic=

to two of the items cited by Helms, namely, the question of audio (electro.ic

surveillance) coverage and the suggestion that FBI and CIA specialists in the

communist bloc field hold periodic seminars to coordinate our information.

The Bureau's position regarding electronic surveillance coverage, as

outlined in the Director's letter to Helms of 3/31/70, was reitereated with

emphasis upon the problems such coverage often pose with regard to

prosecution as well as adverse public reaction to this type coverage.

I made the point that the Bureau has not received the necessary.

support in this area from responsible quarters; that in the past the Bureau

had a substantial amount of coverage of this type in the interest of both our

own counterintelligence responsibilities as well as the national security

interest but that we have had to retrench in recent years largely as a résuit

of the lack of support for such operations.

Attorney General. He said that CIA has been giving the question of

approaching the Attorney General considerable thought but this would

involve a whole new set of procedures and policy considerations which

would have to be carefully considered. MAME

said that his staff was in

the process of drawing up a proposal on this point for Mr. Helms to

consider and that they would probably have something specific for the

Bureau to consider at a subsequent meeting.

Concerning the proposed seminar, in line with the Director's

letter to Helms 3/31/70, I pointed out that we would certainly have no

obiection to such conferences where the occasion justified them. From

remarks, it appears that CIA is primarily interested here in the

Soviet field and would like to furnish the Bureau with details of an extensive

¡'estain piûject CIA has undertaken in recent vears to coorelate all available

source inform tion regarding known Soviet intelligence agents. This

apparently would not involve any commitment by the Bureau ana would represe=:

essentially an opportunity for us to see what CIA has done in this field and

how it might tie in with any current Bureau interest. When CIA submits any

firm proposals in this regard, we will submit specific recommendations.

NAME said that CIA would be in touch with us when they have

firmed up various proposals and at that time

MAME

and MYSELE

will meet with them again as required. The Director, of course, will be

kept fully informed and no commitments will be made without his prior

approval.

Contrary to

international emifications.

The course of events and the highly capable

effectiveness of Cormunist-Bloc intelligence services have placed increas-

ing burdens on us and have necessitated close working relations with CIA,

military intelligence services and other agencies.

The complex nature of

it is difficult to believe that the enemy will not make every eifort to

reap the greatest profit possible. Briefly, Mr. Hoover, I have too much

respect for you and our FBI to expose us to a potentially disastrous situ-

ation.

Although the Denver incident is a blight on the relations be-

tween the FBI and CIA, it would be most unfair of me not to comment on

the dedicated and selfless efforts of numerous individuals in ClA who

Get es would be

strived for honest and narmonious relations.

As a result of their en-

deavors there have been many services performed in behalf of the Bureau

including notable and outstanding accomplishments.

We have been furnished

on the part of CIl employes which prevented Bureau commission of errors

and averted embarrassment. Among some of the more significant examoles

of cooperation I cite the excellent and badly needed assistance of CL

in the Rudolph Abel case. I also refer to the Agency's providing us with

one of the better criminal informants we have had in recent years in the

person of Herbert Itkin. I only refer to the foregoing to emphasize

that, if at all possible, we should preserve the good friends and the

supporters of the Bureau.

It is recognized that one con also present a bill of partic-

ulars relating to cramples of poor cooperation and deliberate skuldug-

understanding that you want such grievances identified. There

is enclosed herewith a list of cases or situations which arose

over the years.

Based upon a review of files and my personal recollection:

this list would be representative of matters which CIA could use

for making charges such as: not being forthright, not playing

fairly and squarely, not cooperating, not being of assistance,

not recognizing the

need for concrete FBI contributions to the

foreign intelligence effort. What CIA may have compiled over the s

years is unknown.

What situations are known to CIA and have not

come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am

thinking of leaks including distorted information which may have

been passed to CIA from ex-Bureau employees and CIA informants

and sources.

It should be clearly emphasized that there is no

indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking

any kind of a showdown or confrontation with the FBI. Contrary

to what some people may believe, the relationship between the

two agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite

the problems which have arisen from time to time. I am confident

that a thorough and impartial examination will conclusively

support the foregoing.

In order that there may not'be any misunderstanding, it

important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an

We can also produce an

excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably

CIA could do the same.

sound working relations. and producing badly needed intelligence

Memorandum to the Director

RE: RELATIONS WITH CIA

I believe that it would be most helpful to you and

interested Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment

on the attached material if we analyzed very briefly the role

of the Bureau liaison Agent. A liaison Agent can be a simple

mail courier or he can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confront.

any problem or issue with another-gency, very often working with

very limited information.

• It is expected that the Bureau Agent

carry out his instructions forcefully and efficiently. He must

be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various

conditions.

He must be alert for pitfalls and express himself

In a most judicious and prudent manner but always making certain

that the Bureau position is well fortified.

In evaluating the attached and my encounters with CIA,

it should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were

easy to handle because the Agent had J. Edgar Hoover behind him.

However, when an Agent struck at an official on one day and

-solicited his cooperation the next day, it did require some

resourceful action.

It is believed that other liaison Agents

regularly encounter similar situations.

On numerous occasiOns

i have bitterly fouded with CIA officials and this has included

rough language. I have walked out on Cia officials when I felt

they were unreasonable.

They took the initiative by asking the

Agent to return. I did try to play fairly and squarely with all

of them and never hesitated to accept a confrontation; this included

the Director of the Agency. When I lectured to CIA personnel

over the years I always made a point to challenge them to present

any grievances or raise any subject matter relating to the

• Bureau.

I never left a discussion with any CIA official without

"being positive that our position was absolutely understood.

The approaches utilized by me might be open to criticism.

I

can only refer to the records of the Bureau and CIA and I believe

the Bureau's position is most favorable. I don't think CIA has

ever transmitted a letter of protest to the Bureau during the

eighteen years during which the Agent handled the assignment.

IN THIS BOCUMENT. KP1/898

INVOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

(1) MOCASE (THE BORIS MORROS CASE)

This was a sensitive Soviet-espionage case

which originated in 1943 and terminated for the most

part in 1957.

The case had many wide foreign ramifi-

cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly

will be, one of the most important and involved cases

of Soviet operations in this country and abroad. We

did not disseminate any information of significance

in this case until 1954. On various occasions when

the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu~

ments with ClA officials, they have seen fit to raise

this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to

cooperate with the Agency. The position taken by CIA

was that it should have been advised regarding the

Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,

claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity

to develop more information of significance, identify

Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for

recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives.

We did

not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the

extreme sensitivity of the case.

We actually did not

permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to

the MOCASE until 1957.

In 1957, CIA complained that it certainly had

every right to have received the information earlier

because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA

employees and operations. CIA further argued that it

had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out

the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the

Agency at the same time that the case

With regard to dealing with the French, we

took the position that we would cover the leads through

our Legal Attaches wherever possible and to furnish

leads to CIA in those countries where we did not have

Legal Attaches. CIA maintained that since we were on

record that our Legal Attaches do not handle operations

abroad, the Bureau had an obligation to levy those french

Jeads on CIA or at least coordinate with the Agency

before going to the French.

It is to be noted that in any argument relating

I to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA will fall back on the

responsibilities placed on the

Agency under the provisions

of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation

of the foregoing through National Security Council Direc-

tives.

CIA will maintain that it is incumbent upon the

Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security

Act of 1947 and the Directives.

The Agency would argue

that in the MOCASE, these were ignored by the Bureau.

I (Bufile - 100-352385)

(2) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN MEXICO

During the 1950's, CIA periodically raised

questions concerning the functions of our Legal Attache

Office in Mexico City. As early as 1951, CIA claimed

that the Legal Attache was acting outside of the scope

of the Bureau's jurisdiction since we were on record

that our Legal Attaches were acting strictly in a liaison

capacity, yet we allegedly were conducting operations

such as developing penetrations of the Communist Party

of Mexico. A heated discussion took place in 1951

between the two Agencies but we did not change or modify

Ithe operations of our office in Mexico. CIA, from time

to time, has informally raised questions on our running

informants in Mexico and still being able to comply with

Directives.

The interpretation given by CIA is that

overseas counterintelligence operations, including the

operation of informants by the Bureau, must be coordinated

with CIA. Further

interpretation by the Agency has been

that "coordination" means a discussion of the operation,

including the identity of the informant, if the Agency

SECRET

55036 DooId:32989616 Page 112

## Page 113

SECRET

feels such information is necessary. CIA officials

have casually and informally referred to the situation

in Mexico as a potential issue and conflict but, for

-

several years, nobody in CIA has seen fit to create

any kind of a problem. We, of course, might be vulner-:

able since we have been operating informants in Mexico •

for many years. The problem undoubtedly was greatly

mitigated because of the outstanding work of former

Legal Attache John Speakes and the current Legal

Attache Nathan L Ferris.

As an example of a situation encountered through-

out the years, in 1957 our Legal Attache, Mexico City,

asked the local CIA office for an up-to-date list of

Soviet Embassy personnel in order to keep apprised of

the identity of the Soviets officially assigned in

Mexico City. The CIA office responded but included

the following statement "It is understood that your

office has no operations aimed at or involving the Soviet

Embassy or any of the persons on the attached list.

If

I am wrong, I should appreciate being advised." The

Legal Attache advised that in his opinion, the wording

of the CIA communication did not warrant a reply. He,

however, reported to the Seat of Government, that at

that particular time, we did have three cases which

might be considered as operations directed against the

Soviet Embassy. (Memorandum Belmont to Boardman,

March 22, 1957, re: "Relations with CIA," 62-80750)

In 1963, Legal Attache, Mexico City, received

information indicating that clA intended to penetrate the

Communist Party of Mexico at the top leadership levels.

The Legal Attache pointed out that this proposed action

night affect top-level informants of the Legal Attache

Since ClA would undoubtedly be making requests of the

Bureau concerning certain individuals, including those

who were our informants.

The Legal Attache proposed

|that if CIA levied any request on him, he would furnish

ample intormation on each Party leader, but only infor

mation which was well balanced in quality and quantity,

so that no one individual would stand out at the risk of

being pinpointed.

August 5, 1963, re: "Legal Attache Office, Mexico City,"

How much information CIA has developed over

the years concerning our operational activity in

Mexico City is unknown.

However, we should bear in

mind that former Special Agent George Munro handled

many of our operations in Mexico, including key infor-

mants, and subsequently began performing services for

CIA after he left the Bureau.

We also should not

forget that Americans operating in Latin American

countries for one agency are heavily exposed to the

resources of another U. S. intelligence or investigative

agency.

This Agent knows from personal experience that

operating in these areas constitutes a "very small world"

and the exposure to leaks and errors is considerable.

(3) THE ABEL CASE

Although CIA has not raised the point for

several years, the prevailing attitude was, and probably

still exists,

that the FBI did not play it

square with

CiA in the abel case by not making certain that the

Agency was given the proper recognition for its contri-

butions.

CIA feels that in the first place, there would

not have been any U.S. access or availability to the

source in this case, Reino Hayhanen, because CIA took

the full responsibility for moving Hayhanen from France

Ito the U. S. in 1957. CIA claims it took the risk and

responsibility of doing this after the Bureau declined

to become involved in any operation designed to transport

Hayhanen to the U. So

was an alcoholic and

It should be noted that Hayhanen

that his first contacts with CIA

in Paris raised questions concerning Hayhanen's mental

stability.

After Hayhanen arrived in the U. S., we

arranged access to him for a period, the purpose of

which was to obtain a complete story of his intelli-

gence activities in the U. S. and we were particularly

interested in identifying

all of his associates, es-

pecially the man who later was identified as rudolph

Abel.

After a short handling period in the U. S., we

dropped Hayhanen because he became a problen.

was

an extremely critical situation because we had not yet

identified Abel. CIA agreed to take the responsibility

were given free access to this difficult source. This

was a most fortunate arrangement as far as CIA was con-

cerned, because this adjustment gave us the time to work

with Hayhanen and subsequently develop the leads which

led to the apprehension of Abel. The Agency has main-

tained that it was largely responsible for making

absolutely certain that Hayhanen was mentally and

physically prepared for testimony at the Abel trial.

Hayhanen was a key witness.

CIA has also referred to

the heavy expenses incurred by the Agency, all for the

benefit of the Bureau.

CIA has complained that the

Bureau never really thanked the Agency for its coopera-

tion and CIA has been particularly irked becaused the

Bureau did not see fit to inform the Attorney General

or the White House of the role played by CIA.

(Bufile - 65-64538)

(4) WILLIAM P. BUNDY CASE

In July, 1953, Senater Josenh MeCarthy sought -

to subpoena William P. Bundy, then a CIA official, to

testify before the Senator's Committee. McCarthy claimed

that Bundy's alleged communist activities were clearly

documented: The most serious allegation was that Bundy

had contributed $400 to the detense tund of alger Hiss.

All of this was publicized. The information set torth

in the newspapers emanated

terences concerning the matter but charges were never

this particular item is not known but the Agency did

know that we maintained liaison with McCarthy's Committee.

(5) BUREAU DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION CONCERNING JAY LOVESTONE

In May, 1954, Allen Dulles raised the questior

concerning the propriety a FBi dissemination of intormatior

concerning Jay Lovestone.

This information had been fur-

nished to us by Spencer Miller, a former official of the

Department of Labor.

When interviewed by us, Miller

made-several accusations against CIA.

We disseminated

the information to the White House,

the Attorney General,

and some data also went to the

State Department. Dulles

took the position that by disseminating derogatory in-

formation concerning his Agency, he had been placed on

the spot because the Spencer Miller data was not the

complete story.

In the past, CIA informally referred

to this as an instance of very unfair conduct on the part

of the Bureau. (Memorandum Keay to Belmont, May 24, 1954,

re: "Relations with CIA," 62-80750)

•(6) BUREAU HANDLING OF CIA REQUESTS FOR TOURS

FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS

On occasions in the 1950's, CIA complained that

officials visiting the U. S. under CIA sponsorship were

given excellent treatment on the tour but, nevertheless,

many of the visitors left most diseppointed because they

had

not had any contact with any Bureau officials.

CIA

felt that contact with Bureau officials had very significant

benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of

the FBI's world-wide reputation.

CIA also pointed out that

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,

they were left with the suspicion that there was some kind

of friction between the FBI and CIA. In 1956, we had a

clear-cut policy to the effect that

tours for

such visi-

would be of a restrictive nature in that such

visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the

Agency from truly enhancing U.s. Interests abroad.

CIA never lodged an official complaint.

enhance complainvisit at Bueal

It should beemphasized that for the past several

years there would not be any basis for any formo complaint

with regard to Bureau treatment of foreign officials coming

to the U. S. under CIA sponsorship.

The personal attention

given to such officials by Assistant Director Sullivan and

other officials and Supervisors in the Domestic Intelligence

Division has been outstanding and benefits have accrued to

the Bureau. These visitors have gone back to their native

In addition, we have learned more about these

countries, their services, and their security chiefs

by spending a few minutes with them. Needless to say,

this kind of treatment has also immeasurably helped

our Legal Attaches.

(8) COLONEL JOHN GROMBACH (PAT O' BRIEN)

Colonel John Grombach was a retired U. S.

Army officer who, during world War Ii, established a

private intelligence network, operating throughout the

world but primarily in Europe. His sources included

any number of suropean exiles

who came to the U.s.

Department, then the Department of the army, and in the

on us and furnished information which Grombach felt

was of interest to us. This dissemination through

Pat O'Brien continued

during the period of Grombach's

relationship with CIA. We never informed CIA that we

were receiving such information which also was of

interest to the Agency.

It is possible that Grombach

had given the same data to CIA but we do not know. CIA

and Grombach clashed and the relationship was severed

in an atmosphere of severe bitterness.

Years of its dealings with Grombach, Ehe Agency had (S)

successfully penetrated the latter's organization and

allegedly had identified many of the sources. CIA

hinted to the Liaison Agent that it had become aware

of the relationship between Grombach's organization

and the Bureau.

How much CIA really learned about

were significant, the Agency may have developed evidence

to justify a charge that the Bureau had withheld infor-

(10) INTERNAL SECURITY LEADS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

During the 1950's, we gave our Legal Attaches

numerous leads stemming from internal security cases in

the U.S. In many instances we did not see fit to

notify CIA although the Agency always maintained that

you could not separate "internal Security" from "counter-

intelligence," namely a lead in France pertaining to a

communist in

the U. S. warranted advising CIA, if not,

at least asking the Agency to handle the lead.

In the

last several years, it is not believed that there is

any basis for complaint since we have regularly been

notifying CIA concerning subjects of cases who travel

abroad.

If the Legal Attache is investigating, CIA is

notified in order to avoid duplicate efforts.

There

have been exceptions where we have taken the position

that CIA should not be notified because of the sensitivity

of the matter. How many such exceptions are known to

CIA cannot be established irom our Illes; nowever, we

should hear in mind that, when our Legal Attaches inves-

tigate, they

contact many of the same foreign officials

normally contacted by CIA.

How many of these foreign

officials are CIA informants, or on the Agency payroll,

is unknown.

Legal Attache's Office in Havana. Informants reported

on activities of communists and other subversives in

unknown.

evidence to establish that we had been operational in

In 1959 the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused

our Legal Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert

intelligence activity "of a nature which I believe

exceeds his terms of reference." The Ambassador further

indicated that CIA was unhappy over the Legal Attache's

activities and the Agency allegedly had told the Ambassador

that the Legal Attache had disseminated information from

a source who was a fabricator or a provocator. This

situation arose as a result of the Legal Attaches

operation of an informant in Brazilys Some of the

information that he received from the informant was

of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who

(13) BORDER COVERAGE

In June, 1957, our Phoenix Office presented a

problem concerning the Bureau's handling of informants

on the Mexican border.

These informants were operating

inside Mexico.

The problem was predicated on situations

which might arise as the result of CIA's endeavors to

develop informants who already were being handled by the

Bureau. It was pointed out that CIA logically could

come in contact with such sources and could make approaches

for recruitment. It was recommended and approved that

in order to protect our coverage in the border area, a

valuable, trusted, and reliable confidential source would

continue

to be utilized even if he were contaced by CIA.

Our policy was that we would not identify our sources to

the Agency.

(16) CASE OF EDWARD ELLIS SMITH

On July 9, 1956, an official of the State

advised the Bureau that

Edward Ellis Smith, a CIA employee in Moscow, had been

involved in an affair with a Soviet girl. According

to our source, Smith allegedly had furnished information

to the Soviet girl.

We checked with the State Department

and CIA and we confirmed that Smith had been involved in

an affair and that he had been recalled. According to

CIA and State Department, there was no indication that

Smith had been involved in any espionage against the

U.S.

CIA gave consideration to requesting the Bureau

to identify is source and then changed its mine.

Whether CIA has documented this as an instance where

the Bureau failed to cooperate by not volunteering the

source is a matter of conjecture but, it is a case that

should be kept in mind. (Bufile - 65-64084)

determined that the Legal Attache had made inquiries in

Paris in response to leads which had been sent from Bureau

Headquarters.

This matter is being highlighted because

it was a vitally important operation to CIA and the Agency

had received indications that information had been leaked

to French authorities.

We have no evidence or reason to

believe that the Legal Attache Office ever involved itself

in any such leak. However, we should not, under any cir-

cumstances, discount the fact that CIA has penetrated

french

services and has had access to sensitive information

in Paris.

The French have always had an outstanding cap-

ability of tapping phones and installing microphones in

Paris.

Such coverage on U. S. officials, including their

residences, should never be excluded.

The information we

had conveyed to our Legal Attache possibly may have been

acquired by the French through clandestine coverage.

CIA

possibly could charge us with handling their sensitive

information in an insecure manner by transmitting it to

Paris without conferring with the Agency.

In connection with alleged Frouch espionage

activity in the U. S., CIA has never been satisfied with

the efforts made by the Bureau.

The Agency possibly could

take the position that we looked lightly at the allegations

and did not pursue a matter which, in their eyes,

merited

& more aggressive approach. (Bufile - 105-109053)

For some time, CIA has held to a position that

the French Intelligence Service (SDECE) is penetrated by

the Soviets.

The Agency has pointed out that if the French

are collecting sensitive information in the U. S., the

product is ending up in Moscow. In January, 1964, we

reviewed the status of our investigation of French intel

ligence activities in the U.S. The Director commented

"I think this whole thing has been imaginary on the part

of cla which has been played as a sucker by Devosjoli.

I would waste no more time on it at least until all CIA

restrictions are removed." CIA did impose restrictions

by not permitting us to pursue certain leads because it

feared that its sensitive source would be jeopardized.

currently Deputy Director of CIA, was attached to Vice

(37) POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE

(5)

This is an area where discussion with CIA

officials can rapidly generate criticism of the Bureau

for failure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis-

tance.

Positive intelligence, briefly, is that information

which might assist the U. S. Government in formulating

foreign policy. Much of it is of a political nature and

a vital portion pertains to scientific developments, military

capabilities of foreign countries, and intentions of foreign

countries. Positive intelligence is not only important

as it concerns the communist-bloc countries but also

the non-bloc nations.

There never has been any law, Directive, or

Executive Order which has fixed the responsibilities for

the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in

the U.s.

The Bureau does have a responsibility which

we refer

to as internal security and which falls into the

accepted area of counterintelligence. We do investigate

subversives, spys, and we develop penetrations of foreign

intelligence services.

Our work in the positive intelli-

gence field, for the most part, has been restricted to

the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the State .

Department, usually when a political crisis occurs in

some country.

CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous

unexplored field for expanded acquirement of positive

intelligence in the U.S. This would mean vastly increased

technical surveillance coverage, development of informants,

and collection of cryptographic material. CIA does not

feel that we have aggressively moved on this particular

subject and that over the years, the Agency has been

•thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem.

In October, 1969, CIA requested the Bureau to

install technical surveillances at the offices and temporary

residences of two Indian Government officials visiting the

U.S. Pursuant to instructions, CIA was told to seek the

authority of the Attorney General. The Director stated.

that he did not want CIA utilizing FBI as a channel.

In the same month, CIA inquired if the Bureau

would reestablish technical

surveillance coverage on

valman shapiro who cla felt was a key ligure in the

transmittal of scientific intelligence data to the

(s) Israeli Intelligence service. He declined to reinstatute

the coverage. CIA considered the matter important because

of its relationship to the Mideast Crisis.

On October 21, 1969, we told CIA that future

requests from CIA for technical surveillance coverage

should be transmitted by the Agency directly to the

Attorney General.

CIA has never made any official comment or

protest but it has considered the afore-mentioned action

by the Bureau as unfriendly and uncooperative. The Agency

has looked to the Bureau as the logical point of contact and

as the only organization having the resources and capabilities

of adequately determining if such coverage is even feasible.

(38) MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

The Liaison Agent recalls fragments of other

situations or conflicts which occured over the years and

which resulted in the voicingol CIA displeasure or criticism.

The Agent cannot recall the names of the cases which is

necessary to acquire the required data. There was one

• instance early in the 1950's which involved information

received from a source of unknown reliability charging

Allen Dulles with having been a communist and a spy while

in Europe. We disseminated the information to several

agencies. Dulles exploded but never lodged a protest.

The Agent also has recollection of instances when

CIA alleged that its source or informant was compromised by

Bureau revelation of CIA information during the course of

interviews conducted by us.

Technically, this would be a

violation of the third agency rule and, if CIA had hard

core facts, we would be vulnerable, particularly it an

important informant was lost.

CIA never made any official

issue or protest.

Reference is made to my letters dated March 2 and

is important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce

an extensive list of justified grievances."

It is my under-

standing that the Director desired that this list be identified.

Enclosed herewith is a list of approximately 75 items.

This list should not be considered absolutely complete,

Preparation was predicated on my personal recollection and a

review of Bureau records.

To make this list more complete and

specifically accurate would necessitate the review of thousands

The enclosed list can be supported hy Bureau records.

What CIA records reflect on the same items is unknown.

This

also must be kept in mind in connection with our evaluation

of the alleged CIA grievances which I previously listed.

if the Director feels that our Bureau work can benefit

1.

ATTACKS AGAINST BUREAU (MEXICO CITY AND FRANCE - 1951)

Although Agent Papich did not begin handling Liaison

with CIA until 1952, it is important to refer to highly signi-

ficant differences with CIA which culminated in a serious

conflict in the Fall of 1951. Our Legal Attaches in Mexico City

and Paris reported that CIA representatives were attacking the

Bureau, were endeavoring to place us in an unfavorable light,

were questioning our jurisdiction, and were making disparaging

remarks concerning the Bureau.

Bureau Bone 02 this

Some of this was summed up by

characterizing it as covert hostility within CIA, stemming

largely from disgruntled former employees of the FBI.

In October, 1951, General Walter Beddil Smith, then

Director of CIA, asked to meet with the Director and other

Bureau representatives for the purpose of discussing the

existing differences.

General Smith denied that there was any

covest hostility against the Bureau and maintained that there

was a general feeling of respect for us.

He admitted that

there had been isolated instances of friction for which CIA

must accept its share of responsibility.

It is my recollection that the Director and other

Bureau officials did meet with General Smith, at which time

guidelines were set forth for maintaining future relations

between the two agencies.

I was not able to find a memorandum

of record covering this meeting. (62-80750-1712, 1715, 1716,

1726, 1728, 1748, 1750)

2. PROSELYTING OF BUREAU PERSONNEL BY CIA

The Agent clearly recalls that early in the 1950's

we encountered difficulties with CIA because the Agency allegedly

was recruiting Bureau-employed personnel.

We vigorously pro-

tested, and subsequently, the Agency advised that it would follow

a policy of not having any contact with a Bureau employee until

the Individual had been separated from the Bureau for a period

of at least thirty days. The Agent could not locate the back-

ground of this matter in the files reviewed by him. It is pos-

sible that the pertinent information lies in the personnel file

of some former Bureau Agent.

DEFECTORS - 1951.

By letter dated October 13, 1954, a very strong letter

of protest was sent to General T. J. Betts

of the Interagency

Defector Committee &t CIA. This

letter made reference to

political asylum which was being considered for certain Polish

sailors who had been seized by the Chinese Nationalist Government.

General Betts disseminated a memorandum indicating that members

of the Committee had agreed that in view of commitments made

by the United States and Chinese officials, that failure to

arrange re-entry for the Polish seamen would have an adverse

effect on the over-all United States Defector Program.

We

emphasized to General Betts that this matter had never been

officially presented before the Defector Committee. He was

informed

that his action was not conducive to mutual cooperation.

In July, 1956, a statement was made by a State

Department official to the effect that a CIA employee allegedly

had advised that the subject, a Soviet agent, was being per-

mitted to enter the United States so that his activities

could be covered and so that the Bureau would be in a position

to promote a defection.

The Bureau was not in possession of

any information indicating that we had sanctioned the entry

of the subject for the purpose described above. The State

Department official was unable to recall the name of the CIA

employee involved; inquiry at CiA was negative. He were not

The article was written byl

The article

was very complimentary toward CIA. The author made reference

to relations between the Bureau and CIA and quite clearly

indicated that they were strained. He claimed that the CIA

took Agents from FBI; that Agents did not remain in the Bureau

for an extended period; and he related a story very critical

of the Director.

We learned that the author had been in contact with

CIA when he was preparing the article. We were told that lyman

that based upon the information made mailable CIA had promoted,

the question of strained relations between the two agencies

APPEARANCE

OF COLONEL FRANTISEK TISLER BEFORE THE

HOUSE COMMITTEE. ON UNAMERICAN ACTIVITIES (HUA) - 1959

On November 6, 1959, information was received

indicating that HCUA was interested in obtaining Colonel Frantisek

Tisler, a Czech defector, to testify before the Committee. HCUA

advised us that it had contacted the State Department who, in

turn, had conferred with CIA. Allen Dulles allegedly informed

FCUA

that Tisler was agreeable to appearing before the Committee

and that he would be made available pursuant to certain security

instructions.

The Director asked whether or not CIA had authority

to make a defector available to a congressional committee without

first checking with other interested agencies. The Director was

informed that CIA did not have such authority

because a National

Security Council directive made it very clear that this could not

be done without processing the matter through the Inter-Agency

Defector Committee. In this particular case the aforementioned

Committee had not called a meeting,

but the chairman, a CIA

official, had made certain phone calls. A Bureau representative

was contacted by phone on November 6,

1959, but at that time we

had not formulated a position. Allen Dulles allegedly contacted

70. CIA AND ITS INVOLVEMENT IN LEGISLATION

DEALING WITH THE "ERVIN BILL"

Act 6 (11 (B)

On June 5, 1969, information was received indicating

that Richard Helms had sent Senator Sam Ervin three proposed

amendments to the legislation being proposed by the Senator, .

all dealing with the protection of the constitutional rights

of Government employees. We had been following developments

relating to this proposed legislation because the provisions

had a very definite bearing on Bureau operations. The proposed

amendments made by Helms included exemptions from certain

provisions of the Bill for FBI, CIA, and the National Security

Agency:

These amendments. were

suggested by CIA without prior

consultation with the Bureau.

The

Director made the notation,

"This presumptuous action of Helms' is astounding." (M. A. Jones

to Bishop memorandum, June 6, 1969, "S. 782; Protection of

Constitutional Rights of Government Employees to Prevent

Unwarranted Invasion of Their Privacy')

71.. CIA COVERAGE OF BUREAU LEADS

Historically, CIA's coverage of Bureau leads had

been decidedly spotty from the standpoint of delivering

satisfactory content and servicing the leads within a reasonable

period of time.

It would be necessary to review hundreds, if

not thousands, of files to document what we consider delays in

following our

leads.

It should be noted that CIA, organizationally,

has never maintained an atmosphere of discipline in any way

comparable to that of the Bureau. Matters are not followed

as promptly and responsibility is not firmly fixed. This

evaluation is made in light of standards followed by the Bureau.

He continually prod and push CIA for responses. To develop all

of the evidence to explain these delays would require an inspection

of CIA operations. CIA has given the following types of responses:

hazards of adverse operating conditions in backward countries;

limited personnel; undue exposure to hostile intelligence, police,

and

security services; pressures placed on the Agency on priority

in foreign

countries.

Although CIA has not ventured to emphasize the

point, it

is believed that in many instances it has not pro-

duced

satisfactorily and

efficiently because of the absence

of reliable sources.

72. LACK OF PROPER ORIENTATION OF BUREAU

RESPONSIBILITIES AND JURISDICTION

Although there has been decided improvement in

recent years, the Liaison Agent continues to note a definite

lack of knowledge of FBI responsibilities and jurisdiction on

the part of CIA employees.

They do receive some training in

this regard, but the impression is left that such training

could be much more extensive.

lectured to hundreds of CIA employees in the last few years

and this has produced significant signs of concrete benefits.

CIA employees encountered the Liaison Agent on a very regular

basis and asked questions pertaining to our responsibilities.

Nevertheless, there is room for much improvement.

73. CIA POLICY REGARDING DISSEMINATION TO OUR LEGAL ATTACHES

There has been a sore spot in connection with CIA

policy relating to its dissemination of informationat a local

level in our embassies.

/ This policy allegedly has applied tolstU

all other agencies and includes our Legal Attaches. CiA has

maintained

that unless

the information it develops

or receives

is in the immediate jurisdiction of a particular agency, it

will only disseminate at the Seat of Government. As an

example,

if CIA received information concerning the existence of a U.s.

criminal fugitive in a foreign country, it would disseminate

to the Legal Attache.

However, if the information falls within

the area of intelligence, which includes subversive activities,

the Agency has stated that under its system the information is

considered

to be "raw material" and that it must be evaluated

at headquarters and reviewed in the context of what has been

received from other countries, and then disseminated to inter-

ested customers.

We have not raised an issue, but dissemination

regarding political conditions in a country where the Legal

Attache is assigned could be useful because it would further

orient him in his dealings with foreign officials.

There have

been exceptions where the CIA chief in an area, on his own

initiative,] has given such information to our Legal Attache

After CIA disseminates at headquarters, we are in a position

'communicate the information to our Legal Attaches.

This

helps, but it would be much more convenient

for the Legal

Attache to receive itfat the local level.]

simply-has ramifications in this country. In these instances,

CIA has followed a definite pattern over the years of not

furnishing such information to the Legal Attache, but

disseminating to us at Seat

of Government. Here

again, CIA

has maintained that its headquarters must review the data and

make the decision regarding dissemination. We have not raised

an issue.

We could by claiming that the Legal Attache could

74. SOME PAST HISTORY WHICH IS VERY RELEVANT

When evaluating our relationship with CIA, including

our grievances, it is believed that we cannot overlook the

relevancy of the serious differences we experienced with the

Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. The

seeds leading to the establishment of CIA came from OSS. William

Donovan, who was the head of OSS, has been referred to as the

"Father of CIA."

There were instances when OSS blatantly ignored FBI

jurisdiction and failed to coordinate on numerous matters:

There

wassa number of CIA officials who obviously had a definite dislike

for the Bureau.

The loose administration of OSS, its employment

of known subversives, its alleged penetration by the Soviets,

and its attitude toward the Russian Government at the time posed

serious problems to the Bureau, At one point OSS was actually

giving serious consideration to establishing liaison with the

NKVD.

Because a substantial number of OSS officials subsequently

became important figures

within ClA, it would be logical to

assume that the tBt was justilled in being most prudent, it not

circumspect, in dealings with the Agency.

When evaluating its position in 1970, the Bureau

rightfully cannot forget the troubles

with OSS.

At the same

time, it would be most unwise if we neglected to examine the

played by the Bureau when we disbanded our SIS operations

in 1947.

In a matter of hours, we destroyed hundreds of files

in our SIS offices abroad, and

we did not turn over to CIA a

large number of sources and informants.

There have been many

that the Agency could

argue that the actions by the Bureau were detrimental to U.S.

interests and impaired CIA's

to establish desired

RELATIONS WITH CENTRAL

INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

DECLASSTFIED BE: 5660-SLD GCL

4/2/18(2FK)

Reference my memorandum 3/25/70 concerning letter 3/20/70

from CIA Director Helms. In letter, Helms expresses full agreement

with Director's view that intelligence collection efforts of FBI and CIA

must be closely coordinated and that periodic reappraisal of such efforts

is required. He has invited Director's desires as to how such reassessments

can be best conducted. He refers to 1966 conference between Bureau and

CIA representatives, which resulted in agreement covering certain phases of

intelligence coliection, and suggests additional discussions at this time.

Heims has listed nine specific areas for possible discussion at

conference between Bureau and CIA. He states he would sincerely weicome

Director's observations on his proposed agenda. Specific items listed by

Helms are set forth hereinafter together with my observations.

1. Electronic Surveillance Coverage (Elsurs)

Helms notes Bureau has been receptive in past to requests for

this type coverage and has capability and experience in this field which cannot

be duplicated by any other U.S. agency. Helms refers to October, 1969,

whom had KGB connections. Bureau advised CIA at that time that it should

suggests question of such coverage be reopened between FBI and CIA

representatives, adding that this coverag helluld be rigidly controllec.

Comment: We have always been highly selective in our use of

elsurs, particularly during recent years in view of sensitive nature of this

type coverage, legal considerations, and manpower commitments. CLA

which has no prosecutive responsibilities may not understand the Bureau's

position in this matter or need for great selectivity but I do not feel Director

Each one; of

Helms cites importance of this as intelligence tool, which has

been proven in past. He has impression it has been discontinued and suggests

FBI-CIA representatives confer to determine whether such coverage could be

used with regard to investigations of Soviet bloc, New Left, and foreign agents.

Comment: In line with Director's instructions, we have discontinued

this coverage in recent years. We know that other Federal agencies, including

Army and CIA, utilize this tyne coverage frequently and often with success

such as we experienced ourselves in the past. Both Army and ClA regularly

make available to us results of their coverage abroad concerning individuals

of interest to Bureau. This type coverage is sensitive and Helms has not

spelled out specifically what CIA may have in mind here. This type coverage

3. CIA Technical Services

Helms calls attention to recent technical and scientific equipment

recently developed by CIA in the counterintelligence field (specialized TV

equipment, laser beam devices, etc.). He indicates willingness to share

such equipment and devélopments with Bureau and indicates he would welcome

suggestions as to how such equipment can be better employed.

Comment: While it is not likely CIA has developed equipment of

this type which is not already known to FBI Laboratory and while some of

equipment to which Helms alludes may have no applicability to our needs, I

do not believe we have anything to lose by exploring this on a selective basis.

Qualified personnel from FBI Laboratory could confer with appropriate CIA

representatives to insure we have benefit of any recent scientific advances

realized by CIA.

RE: RELATIONS WITH-CIA:

*. Courses in Positive Intelligence Requirements and Reporting

Heirs offers to make available to us training courses in positive

intelligence for purpose of discussing in depth theneeds of the intelligence

community, including CIA.

Comment: I see no need for this at this time. We have a nighly

effective and comprehensive. training program fonour Agents in security worker

and I see no necessity for training lectures by CIA personnel. We regularly

receive from CIA copies of the Current Intelligence Reporting List which out-

lines priorities and requirements of other U.S. intelligence agencies in particu-

lar areas of positive intelligence. These Lists are reviewed by appropriate

supervisors at SOG and are then furnished on regular basis to interested field

oinces. I any new developments occur in this field, we can always reconsider

if wewish. But as stated there is no need at this time.

5. Seminars on Opposition Services

Helms suggests thai FBI and CIA specialists concerning hostile

intelligence services meet as needed to keep abreast of new developments

and patterns on part of hostile intelligence agencies. He feels such

discussions should provide an opportunity to possibly devise new means to

penetrate or neutralize enemy forces.

Comment: I do not believe there is any need for conferences of

I type referred to by Helms except on an infrequent basis. Of course, where

special circumstances warrant and provided such conferences are tightly

controlled by Bureau and specifically approved by Director there would be

no reason to object to them per se.

6. Live Bloc Sources

Helms refers-to prior cooperation between FBI and CIA in handling

of communist bloc defectors and penetration agents but expresses belief there

is room for improvement in establishing more uniform exploitation of these

sources. He invites Director's suggestions for better coordination and evalua-

tion of live source information.

Comment: Our 1966 conferences and agreement with CIA were

largely concerned with coordination and handling of live sources. This agree-

ment has proven effective as Helms agrees. I am not aware of any need for

modifying the 1966 understanding but this is an area which is quite sensitive and

Helms has not spelled out what he may have in mind. I feel we should listen

to any proposals CIA may have to offer on this point in direct discussions with

their representatives. Again, no commitments would be made and any proposa:s

and black extremists while traveling abroad and additional data concerning

foreign funding or support of subversive activities in U.S. We furnish a

greal deal of information to CIA regarding foreign aspects of the extremist

movement developed through our investigations. As to manpower commitments:

our own use of manpower is, of course, under constant review. There are

heavy manpower demands on EBI in a hosi of areas (organized crime, civil

rights, applicant investigations, eic.) outside the security field. I would be

definitely opposed to any discussions with CIA involving the allocation of manpone.

Helms expresses belief there are no serious conflicts in this area

but there may be room to improve quality of liaison so as to expand intelli-

handled at headquarters levei. " To do otherwise could result in loose adminis-

trative control. I feel that we should adhere strictly to our long-standing policy

in this connection and I see no need for discussions with CIA on this issue.

RECOMMENDED REPLY TO HELMS:

I do not believe the Director should seek to furnish detailed

observations regarding the Bureau's position on the various matters suggested

i-by Helms. Many of them are quite sensitivé and complex and there is nothing:

to be gained by spelling out the Director's views in.writing on such matters.

Accordingly, I recommend that a general reply be sent to Helms indicating

our willingness to meet with CIA representatives for direct discussions on

those points which merit further elaboration or where we might at least be

willing to listen to any CIA proposals.

Bearing in mind specific observations set forth above, I think

our reply to Helms should show we are amenable to direct conferences with

ICIA on certain of these issues but we should indicate_we see nothing to be

gained by discissions at this time with regard to the following:

(4) Courses in Positive Intelligence Requirements and Reporting;

(5) Seminars on Opposition Services; (8) New Left and Racial Matters;

and (9) Relations With Domestic Field Offices and Legal Attaches. With

regard to the other points, any discussions with CIA would be strictly within

current policies laid down by the Director and no commitments would be

made by Bureau representatives. All matters requiring a decision which

might arise woula be referred to the Director for a decision.

If the Director desires, Inspector D. E. Moore and myself wouid

represent the Bureau in such meetings with CIA representatives. On a

selective basis, other officials of Domestic Intelligence Division could be

asked to join me as required.

ACTION:

Attached for the Director's approval is a letter to Helms in line

with the foregoing observations.

Washington, D. C..

DECTASSIFTED BY 5662-SLDIGEL

ON 2 9/98

Dear Mr. Helms:

I have carefully reviewed your letter of March 20 setting

out your observations with respect to various matters of mutual interest.

I certainly appreciate your kind comments concerning me and i share

your convictions as to the need for close coorcination of our intelligence

collection activities in behalf of the national security.

•Your letter suggested nine particular areas which might be

the subject of further discussions aimed at improving the coordination of

our operations. A number of these topics are highly sensitive and complex

and I will therefore make no effort here to set forth my views in detail.

However, in response to your letter and as a prelude to any direct discus-

sions on these matters, certain observations on my part may be appropriate.

With regard to electronic surveillance and mail coverage,

there is no question as to the frequent value of such operations in develop-

ing needed intelligence. On the other hand, the use of these measures in

domestic investigations poses a number of problems which may not be

encountered in similar operations abroad.

There is widespread concern

by the American public regarding the possible misuse of this type coverage.

Moreover, various legal considerations must be borne in mind,

inclucing

the impact such coverage may have on our numerous prosecutive responsi-

bilities. The FBI's effectiveness has always depended in large measure on

• out capacity to retain the fuil, confidence of the American people. The use

of any investigative measures which infringe on traditional rights of privacy

must theretore be scrutinized most carelully. Within this tramework. however,

I would be willing to consider any proposals your Agency mayake

demanding responsibilities. While I appreciate your offer, I do not

feel it would be feasible at this time to include the proposed courses

in our training schedules. I would certainly have no objection to the

holding of seminars between specialists of our two agencies in selective

areas of interest when justified by specific circumstances.

Concerning the coordination of FBI-CIA activities in the

exploitation of live sources, both in the communist bloc field and with regard

to key nonbloc establishments, I am not aware of any significant problems.

The 1966 agreement between our agencies was concerned directly with this

question and I have no changes to suggest in the ground rules at this time.

However, in the event your Agency has some specific proposals to make,

I would welcome hearing further from you in this connection.

There is already a considerable exchange of information

between our agencies concerning New Left and racial extremist matters.

Frequently, as you nave pointed out, there have been substantial connections

petween subversive and extremist elements in the United States and their

counterparts abroad. We will continue to furnish your Agency information

being developed by the Bureau which might have a bearing on your

intelligence requirements. At the same time, we are definitely in need of

additional information from your Agency as to the foreign aspects of the

extremist movement in the United States, including foreign funding and

support of local extremist organizations. While I do not believe there is

any neea for detailed discussions on this point, if you have any specific

suggestions to make we would be pleased to consider them.

Similarly, I am not aware of any major problems which exist

at this time in connection with the coordination of our field liaison

operations. it has been my long-standing policy that serious questions

affecting the coordination of our activities with other Government

agencies should be handled and controlled at a headquarters level in

order to avoid administrative confusion and misunderstanding.

In line with my letter of March ll and the observations

contained in your letter of March 20, I will in the immediate future

• designate appropriate officials of the Bureau to meet with your representatives

for detailed discussions of these matters. It is my earnest hope that such

conferences will lead to a sharpened understanding of the responsibilities

and objectives of our respective agencies and will serve to promote more

effective cooperation in our joint commitment to the national intelligence

needs.

RELATIONS WITH CENTRAL

INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

Reference my memorandum 3/30/70 summarizing proposals of

CIA Director Helms regarding FBI-CIA coordination in intelligence collection

actvities. Director approved meetings between CIA and Bureau representa-

tives to further explore these matters.

On afternoon of 4/13/70, Inspector D, E. Moore and myself met

briefly with Mr. James Angleton,

Chief, Counterintelligence Staff, CIA,

and Mir. W. Scott Miler of his staff. This session was strictly exploratory

in nature and was aimed at defining the scope and limitations of our

.. discussions with CIA on the points in question. Angleton noted that CIA

Director Heims will be closey fullowing ine vittome of thest dscuscions

and is personally interested in resolving any current problems in this ared.

Mr. Angleton indicated that C A would like to direct initial attention

to two of the items cited by Helms, namely, the question of audio (electronic

surveillance) coverage and the suggestion that FBI and CIA specialists in the

¿ communist bloc field hold periodic seminars to coordinate our information.

The Bureau's position regarding electronic surveillance coverage, as

outlined in the Director's letter to Helms of 3/31/70, was reitereated with

emphasis upon the problems such coverage often pose with regard to

prosecution as well as adverse public reaction to this type coverage.

I made the point that the Bureau has not received the necessary

support in this area from responsible quarters; that in the past the Bureau

had a substantial amount of coverage of this type in the interest of both our

own counterintelligence responsibilities as well as the national security

interest but that we have had to retrench in recent years largely as a result

of the lack of support for such operations.

Angleton noted that in response to CIA's request for electronic

coverage of two Indian nationals who were suspected KGB agents in the Fall

ot 1969, the Bureau had requested that the tate in saitex up with the

Attorney General. He said that CIA has been giving the question of

approaching the Attorney General considerable thought but this would

involve a whole new set of procedures and policy considerations which

would have to be carefully

considered. Angleton said that his staif was in

the process of drawing up a proposal on this point for Mr. Helms to

consider and that they would probably have something specific for the

Bureau to consider at a subsequent meeting.

Concerning the proposed seminar, in line with the Director's

Jetter to Helms 3/31/70, I pointed out that we would certainly have no

objection to such conferences where the occasion justified them. From

Angleton's remarks, it appears that CIA is primarily interested here in the

Soviet field and would like to furnish the Bureau with details of an extensive

research project CIA has undertaken in recent years to corelate all available

source information regarding known Soviet intelligence agents. This

(apparently would not involve any commitment by the Bureau and would represent

essentially an opportunity for us to see what CIA has done in this field and

now ii migi it in will any curient bureau intonest.

When Cle gunmite any

| firm proposals in this regard, we will submit specific recommendations.

Angleton said that CIA would be in touch with us when they have

1 firmed up various proposals and at that time Inspector Moore and myself

will meet with them again as required. The Director, of course, will be

kept fully informed and no commitments will be made without his prior

approval.

MOCASE (THE BORIS MORROS CASE)

Item number one in the material

submitted to the

Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam Papich in his memorandum

3/5/70 discusses the case of Boris Morros (Mocase) •

BACKGROUND OF CASE

Boris Morros, a Hollywood motion picture

producer,

was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 135. fron

1947 to 1957 he was operated as

a double agent by the FBI.

This

was an extrenely sensitive counterintelligence operation involving

Soviet intelligence activities in the United States in which

MorTos traveled

behind the

Iron Curtain for meetings with his

Soviet principals.

Information obtained by Morros from his Soviet contacts

was disseminated to interested agencies,

including the Central

Intelligence Agency.

On January 25, 1957, Jack Soble, Myra Soble,

and Jacob Albam were arrested in New York

on charges of conspiracy

to commit

espionage against the United states.

PROBLEN WITH CIA

On March 16, 1954, the Bureau disseminated

infornation received from Boris Morros to heads of the various

intelligence agencies, including, CIA.

By letter of Narch 27, 1954,

Lieutenant General C.. P. Cabell, Acting Director of CIA,

criticized the information and, in effect,

characterized it as

NION

"fabrication or, the product of

a paper mill," which conclusion

Cabell stated had been applied to many similar disseminations in

FERDIN IS UN

WERE SHOW

purpose would be served in making any future dissemination to

CIA of information received from this source.

On April 9, 1954, Mr. Allen Dulles, then Director of

CIA, advised Liaison

Agent Papich that he had been looking into the

matter and there was no question in his mind but that his agency

had acted stupidly in transmitting such a letter to the Bureau.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

By letter of April

21

L1954, Mr. Dulles stated that

CIA would appreciate it if the Bureau would kindly continue

to send reports from the source (Morros) which relate

to matters of foreign intelligence.

By letter of April 29, 1954,

the Director expressed the opinion that no useful purpose

would be served by disseminating to CIA information received

from the source in the future.

Nevertheless, memorandum

to MaMA dated

by National Security Council Directivto be furnished to CIA,

it should be carefully evaluated, and a decision made at that

time

as to the officials and agencies

of the Government to whom it

should be disseminated. The Director noted "OK but before anything

goes to CIA from this source I want to pass on it.

This

restriction does not apply to dissemination to other agencies. H"

Subsequent to the foregoing three disseminations were

made to interested agencies, including CIA, based on information

from borros during October and December, 1954, and appropriate

dissemination was made thereafter with the Director's approval.

As the time grew near for prosecutive action, the

Department requested the Bureau to check with CIA to see if

Department attorneys could interview a Soviet intelligenée

defector then in custody of CIA named

AccordIngly, the Director authorized an oral briefing of Mr. Dulles

and on 1/8/57 he and

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

(1) CIA feels it should have been advised much

earlier concerning those aspects of the case relating to

CIA employees.

(2) Leads were, given to CIA. at the same time the

case was

publicized and, therefore, CIA was handicapped.

(3) The failure to coordinate the French aspects

of the case with CIA permitted the French intelligence

agencies to play a dominant role in the European

investigation.

(1) CIA fears the Bureau had not told it all there

was to know about the case that CIA should have known.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA

The Bureau took the position

that any necessary investigation looking 'toward prosecution

in countries where Bureau had a Legal Attache would be

referred by the Legal Attache to the appropriate investigative

agency of that country. In those countries where the Bureau

did not have a Legal Attache, request for investigation would

be channelled through CIA.

Because the NAME

were in

France, the interrogation of the NAME

was handled by

request from the Legal Attache

to the French.

NAME

during World War II had been with the

Office of Strategic Services and had contacts later with CIA

personnel. Prior to decision on prosecution we did not

disseminate information regarding the NAME

because we

feared the effects of compromise from possible leaks would

endanger the life of our source.

This was particularly true

in view of CIA's expressed attitude in 1954. Some leads had

been given to CIA over two weeks before the arrests of the

subjects in the United States. •Leads were not given earlier

because of the fear of possible compromise. As far as

coordinating the french aspects of the case were concerned,

it is doubted that CIA could have exerted any control over

the

French investigation after the French had the information.

There was a distinct difference in this case between

intelligence information and evidence in support of prosecutive

action.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

THE ABEL CASE

Item #3 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses the

Abel case.

According to Papich, CIA felt it was not given proper

recognition for its contribution in the case, in that it took the

risk and responsibility of transporting. NAME from PLACE to the

U. S. in 1957 after the Bureau declined

to become involved in this

transportation; that after a short handling period in the U. S. the

Bureau dropped

NAME

and CIA took the responsibility of safeguarding him, giving the

Bureau free access to him and time to develop leads

leading to the

apprehension of Abel; that CIA was responsible for making

NAME

mentally and physically capable to testify at the Abel trial; also,

CIA incurred heavy expenses, all for the benefit of the Bureau;

further, the Bureau never thanked 'CIA for its cooperation nor did it

see fit to inform the Attorney General or the White House of the

role played by CIA.

BACKGROUND OF THE SITUATION:

on the previous day all officials, including Dulles, commented the

Bureau was following the

case in conformity with its

well established reputation of getting. all the facts. In view of

this, there is no basis for believing that at this time CIA would

Item six in material submitted to the Director by Sam

Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 mentions occasions in the 1950's

when CIA complained that officials visiting the United States

under CIA sponsorship were disappointed because they had no

contact with Bureau officials.

CIA felt' contact with Bureau

officials had significant benefits, left lasting favorable

impressions because of the FBI's world-wide reputation, and

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials

they were left with

suspicions there was friction between the

I'BI and CIA. In 1956, we had a clear-out policy to the effect

that tours for such visitors would be oi a restrictive nature

Moreover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested

mending any method of dissemination and it was up to CIA to handle

NAME In the ensuing period, dispute arose between CIA and

Item number 10 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum of

3/5/70 discussed our furnishing leads to our Legal Attaches

(Legats) without advising Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

or requesting the Agency to handle the, lead.

The observations of Special Agent Papich in this

matter are broad and general in nature. His presentation is

hinged upon the premise advanced by the Agency that "internal

security" cannot be separated from "counterintelligence,"

thereby necessitating our advising CIA of requests to our

Legats to have

• leads covered in foreign countries.

The Manual

of Instructions, Section 102, page 23, states CIA's responsibilities

include collection, collation, evaluation, coordination and

dissemination of intelligence

information. CIA does not have,

among other things, responsibility for "internal security

functions."

In the absence of unusual situations,: We forward

investigative.leads pertaining to our cases in countries where

we have liaison coverage to the particular Legal Attache

concerned.

Through his contacts

the Legat arranges for the

necessary investigation and submits the desired information

according to our reporting needs.

The Legat coordinates

this activity on a local level..

It is more desirable to have our representatives

request investigation abroad in order to achieve maximum coverage,

and to maintain tight control so we can insure that we fulfill

our responsibilities.

DECEASSITIED BY SPIZALMITE

Item Number 15 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses the Director's

refusal of a 1958 CIA request for NAME

to lecture

on communism before & CIA group. Papich stated that CIA accepted

this as an affront and a blatant refusal to cooperate on a most

important subject of interest to both agencies.

The files disclose that by letter 9/25/58 signed by

NAME

to address a selected

group of CIA personnel on the communist movement in the U. S.

CIA suggested dates of 12/9,10,or 11/58.

The Director by routing

slip attached to NAME

letter commented, "it seems strange

that CIA should seek this when its top representative in Japan

considers FBI as a bunch of mere 'flat-feet' and the dangers

of communism as something conjured up in the minds of the FBI.

But then again I note request doesn't comé

Memorandum

made reference to CIA's request ard the Director's comments. It

recommended that the best interests of the Bureau would be served

by giving this lecture, not because of the information which

could be conveyed to CIA on communism in the U.S., but because

it would give MAME

an opportunity to raise a number of

questions himself of the group concerning CIA's own activities

In the field of communism.

It was pointed out that it could be

inquiry of CIA personnel in pLAcE had been made concerning

one of the individuals previously identified as FORSIGN

and also requests had been made for certain biographical data

concerning other individuals. Legal Attache noted that CIA

personnel in PLACE had indicated they were previously aware

of the NAME Case and were impressed with the extreme sensitivity

of the case. We furnished this information to CIA headquarters

and on 5/7/63 CIA referred to the incident and stated that it

was a matter of serious concern to it, requesting that any

future dissemination outside Bureau or to the Legal Attache

'be coordinated in advance with that Agency. This practice

was closely followed. The Director observed in January, 1964,

that he thought the whole thing had been imaginary on

the part

of CIA which had been played as a sucker by MAME

-=

The

Director added that no more time should be wasted on it, at

least until CIA restrictions were removed. We continued

to attempt to get the restrictions removed without success and

covered outstanding leads.

In September, 1964, an analysis of the case disclosed

that although thirty-eight separate investigations were opened

only

three FoREiGN agents were uncovered. Original allegations

Of FOREIGN intent to mount an espionage mission in the United States

could not

be substantiated. This information, coupled with the

fact that CIA refused to make NAME

available to us for

the purpose of resolving discrepancies, prompted a decision

transmitted by us to CIA on 9/30/64 that we were closing our

investigation in this case.

Mr. Papich commented in his memorandum of 3/5/70

CIA never has been satisfied with the efforts made by the

Bureau in this case. Our review indicates our efforts in the

matter were as full and complete as possible under circumstances

where CIA refused to grant us access to the source, did not

respond to request for clarifying data and declined to remove

restrictions making it impossible to take necessary investigative

steps. Should any question be raised in the future, we are in

a position to document our difficulties experienced

with CIA.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

DISSEMINATION OF CIA INTORMATION

IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his

memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph

dated 5/5/65 and entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic."

Special Agent (SA) Papich stated that due to the urgency of the

document Bureau did not obtain CIA clearance to include CIA

information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested

agencies, including CIA.

According to SA Papich, CIA never

made any

protest although it considered our action a violation

of the "third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did

contain CiA data, it also set forth highly significant data

obtained by Bureau through our own informants. The CIA data

was biographical in nature and was used in the monograph to

characterize the past, including, communist contacts, of key

figures in the Dominican Republic. It was taken from the 1963

CIA Biographical Handbook and CIA

telegrams dating back to 1961,

all of which were previously disseminated to the U.S. intelligence.

community by CIA.

No attempt was made in the monograph to

characterize CIA data

as Bureau information and, in fact,

this

information was attributed to "another Government agency," in

accordance with established procedures.

The so-called "third'

agency rule" provides that

classified information originating in a department or agency

will not be disseminated outside the receiving agency without

the permission of the originating agency. However, an exception

to this rule provides that the receiving agency may disseminate

such data to other members of the U. S. Intelligence

Boara (USIB,,

of which Bureau is a' member, unless

the originating agency

uses appropriate control markings limiting its data

to the

use of the receiving agency only. The CIA data used in the

Bureau monograph had no such control markings and our monograph

was disseminated to the President, the Attorney General and

USIB members only.

check telephone toll calls from the home of one fAME

who was allegedly harassing CIA in the Miami area. JAME. was

supposedly seeking information concerning CIA's covert operations.

SA Papich states that we told CIA that we would not check the toll

calls on the basis that the information received was not sufficient

to justify investigation within the Bureau's jurisdiction. SA Papich

also states that "CIA accepted our response but there is no doubt

that the Agency characterized our position as a concrete example of

refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating to the

security of U.S. intelligence operations."

A rEVIeW O1 Bureau tiles disclosed that a memorandum,

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES - AFRICA

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Sam

Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations

Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,

CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to

assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by

providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist

Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa.

His memorandum added that we told that agency the FBI had no

informants available because they were

necessary for our own

operations.

He claims we took the position since we saw no

benefit to

be gained by loaning an informant on a short or

Long torm basis.

Ho states that Cid could argue that as early

as 1960 it had foresight to recognize the need for additional

coverage and when it appealed to the Bureau for assistance,

we did not cooperate. He refers to his memorandum dated 4/7/60

concerning

this matter captioned "Communist Activities in Africa."

The memorandum referred to discloses that on 4/5/60

NAME AND POSITION

CIA, Stated

•that communist organizations were rapidly increasing in strength

on the continent of Africa and that his agency. found

it most

difficult to establish effective penetration.

МАМЕ

noted that

in this connection it was almost impossible for a white man to

move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable

him to develop worthwhile sources.

He asked'if the Bureau would

consider furnishing one of its

Negro informants or developing

• a,n

informant in the Communist Party, USA for eventyal use by CIA in

Africa.

Papich told AHe

that

if the Bureau had a good Negro

informant, we certainly were not interested in having his future

jeopardized nor did we want to lose his production. Papich

added that it undoubtedly would be most difficult to take a Bureau

informant, have him'travel to Africa under some cover and still

be able to satisfactorily explain such activities to his communist

colleagues without becoming a target of suspicion. NAME

said

he recognized all this but asked if the Bureau would give

consideration.:

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

Addendum to Papich's memorandum dated 4/8/60 by

the Internal Security Section pointed out that all of our

informants were necessary for our own operations, particularly

in the communist field, and it recommended and was approved

that CIA be-orally informed that it is not possible to provide

an informant on a loan basis to be used in Africa.

Regrettably, the Bureau was not in a position to

assist CIA. CIA's problem was an

administrative one within

that Agency.

ADVISORY BOARD AND JOHN MC CONE

Item number 30 in the material submitted to the

Director by $A Sam Papich tr his memorandum of Narch 5 result

discusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1963, as a

of a communication the Bureau sent to the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). It was pointed out that

in our communication to PFIAB we attributed certain information

to McCone, then Director of CIA, concerning the matter of

increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments. McCone

charged that the information attributed to him was not so

because he had never made any such statement and he could

prove it.

The lact was that the information relating to

McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had

indicated the information originated with McCone.

McCone

maintained that we should have checked with him before going

on record that any infornation had originated with him.

A review of the file in this matter discloses? that

1n Ax 11, 1963, NAME

along with Papich had discussed

with

NAME

and.NAME

of CIA McCone's alleged

position with the PFIAB; that he was in favor of across the

board telephone taps on diplomatic establishments. The

Bureau, of course, wasopposed to this and advised lAME that

we would request to make our position known before the board.

At the conclusion of the meeting in April, 1963, nAME

specifically asked what he should tell McCone and MAMe

told him he should tell McCone exactly what had occurred at

the meeting; that the Bureau was opposed to across the board

wire taps and the Bureau intended to so advise PFIAB.

CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles

also stated

as follows:

"It is significant that information in the indi-

Therefore, there is a

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

The Bureau's success in handling disme can be

attributed to the know-how of the sas of the New York

Office becausedan is a highly emotional individual

a high degree of skill in dealing with this source in

order to achieve the success that we did.

While it is acknowledged that CIA put us

originally in touch with this source, it was not

believed that it is essential that we go back to CIA

and explain to them our success or to thank them for .

giving us this original léad. It is also noted that

there is an obligation upon Government agencies to

cooperate in the fullest and CIA's cooperation in this

matter was in accordance with the long standing policy

among all Government agencies.

This is in line with : NAME

EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION

0x 1-11-01

Item number 34 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 concerns

exchange of technical information' with CIA, particularly as

it related to the technical surveillance field. Papich states

CiA exhibited its equipment to us, but for many years we declined

to show any of our devices, with some exceptions. He states

that CIA never made an official protest but informally indicated

from time to time that the lack of exchange was prejudicial to

overall intelligence and internal security interests and implied

we were more open with the British in this area than with CIA.

Papich states this situation does not exist today as there is

a good exchange by the Bureau and CIA.

Our files reveal that through the years CIA has

furnished the Bureau a number of technical devices for our use

or inspection.

They have also furnished technical manuals obtained

abroad

and briefed us on operational and technical aspects of

some of

their operations abroad. • Laboratory personnel have been

afforded tours and briefings concerning CIA facilities ahd

equipment and in two instances Bureau personnel have been afforded

training at CIA schools.

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH

(POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE)

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief

that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance

in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.

Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich

to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy

of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned

Item by Papich points out CIA belief that

more aggressive action should have been taken in field of

collecting positive intelligence in the United States.

Papich

notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been

restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when

political crises occur in some country.

He points out CLA belief

that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-

Lance coverage, developmenapich aformants and collection of

cryptographic material.

cites two specific cases occurring

in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,

suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the

Attorney General. Review of specific cases mentioned set forth

with Director's comments relative thereto being noted.

Our

policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field

by SAC Letter 65-10 (B) - copy attached. SAC lefter calls for

guarding our jurisdiction but shows our willingness to cooperate

with CIA.

RU6S1

DETAILS:

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive

order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of

such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and

that facets of these investigations of violations of United States

laws serve

to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred

to by us as investigations of internal security matters.

Papich

notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

has been

restricted to the compliance with requests by

State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring

in some foreign country.

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of

vastly increased

technical surveillances, informant development

and collection of cryptographic material. According to Papich,

CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area

and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the

problem. Papich cites two cases MAME

The Director's letter to MAME

noted that

after careful review it was felt that CIA should take this

matter to the Attorney General.

The Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,

changes inherent in faster

communication, hysteria to facilitate

international travel and in response to requests from CIA, the

Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA

regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United

States.

On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with

CIA,

the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our

guard down as CIA has always outsmarted'us because of

our

gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the

field and Bureau offiçials results of the conferences with CIA

and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction.in

the counterintelligence field.

This SAC letter (copy attached)

emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement

upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness

cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the

United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director

noted "I hope

there is no 'sneaker' in this.

Time will tell."

There has been

no renewed request from CIA for

technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there

been any indication that such requests have been sent by CIA

to the Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest

in the past in these matters, we cannot rule out the possibility

the Agency may approach

Attorney General for the desired

coverage at some time in the future.

(B) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCI - OPCRATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES - The Bureau recently completed discussions with the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarding that agency's operational activitics in

the United States. These discussions essentially denit with CiA's assestcht

and recruitment of foreign intelligence sources in the United States. Endlesad

toi your use is a list oi the ground rules which both agencies have accepted

as guidelines for effecting the necessary coordination. In order that you may

be adequately oriented in this matter, the following background is set crth.

The need for the ground rules is related to Cli's interesi in developing

positive intelligence sources in the Unitec States and the necessity for

protecting the Bureau's jurisdiction in the counterinteiligence field. The

latter is essential to the adequate dischaige of our responsibilities to

national security.

Positive intelligence may be described is a comprchensive product

resulting from collection, evaluation, colation, chalysis, and interpretation

of all available intormation relatirg to national security and concerning die:

countries where such information is signiticant to our Go: ernient's deralna-

ment and execution of plans: policies, and courses of action. Such intelligence

can be divided into various categories, suen as econoinic, military, scienufic.

political; geographic, st cerera. The collection of positive intelligence is

distinguished from counterintelligence waich is primarily cosigned to pendate.

monitor, neutralize and/or disrupi the foreign inteiligence and security services.

Counterintelligence further includes other functions of an internal security

nature directed againsi subrersive groups, cagumzations, and induriduals. By

law CIA does not have any law enforcement o. internal security funcuone. Ci's

authorization for collecting positive intelligence is predicated on the Nationai

Security Act of 1947 and subsequent issuance oi National Security Council

Directives. There is no law: directive, or charter which authorizes Cia io

engage in the clandestine development of positiva intelligence sources in the

United States. Thereîcre, in the absence of any statuory prerogative to conduc-

such activity in the United States, it nes been mutually arced by FBI and Ci

that the Agency can only engage in the clandestine developrient and handing ef

positive intelligence sources in this country by coordinating with the Dorea:

The Bureau in turn legally has the primary counterinielligence responsioni::

in the U. S. and is continually developing pestttre intelligence, It, hostar.

must be regarded an incidental product to our main objective. The Buretu

of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to

bring about the necessary coverage. A good example is our involvement

in the development of information relating to the crisis in the Dominican

Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be "gray areas"

of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to

effect adequate coordinating machinery.

The potential for the development of positive inteiligence in this

country is vast and varied. Voluminous positive intelligence is collected

overtly through the review of foreign and comestic publications, interviews

of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this

area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive

intelligence both agencies have an interest, and there is a necessity for a

clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is

this true in the development of positive intelligence sources who are

employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States

or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many year's he Bureau has had a continuing prograin of

developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of discharging

our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for developing

positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in

formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA s need for sources in the

positive intelligence field, has permitted CIA to assess and recruit sources in

the United States in a limited manner with the understanding that such activities

are fully coordinated with the Bureau. In January, 1964, CIA established

their Domestic Operations Division (DOD) to conduct such operations in the

United States. and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished

the necessary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with CIA

resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established

in January, 1961.

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA

as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be decided at the

Seat of Government. As a general rule. Bureau Headquarters will be intormed

by ClA regarding its interest in an individual or a target.

Prior to notiricatior

of CIA regarding our position, the situation will be carefully reviewed at the

Seat of Government. This may often include a request to the field for

observations and recommendations before notice is transmitted to CIA. Ai

the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a

representative of DOD, CIA. I so, you should be guided by the enclosed •

ground rules in any discussions, bezring in mind that the approval for any

particular cperational activity is lo be made at Bureau Headquarters.

You should hold to the concept that the protection of the interna!

security of the United States involves very basic clear-cut responsibilities

of the FBI. This should be kept in mind in each case and in any contacts

which you may have with CIA representatives. There is to be no interfere-se

with or infringement upon our jurisdiction. It is recognized that unforesee.

developments may create siuations not adequately covered by the ground riles.

You, therefore, should report such matters to the Bureau setting forth

complete details with your recommendations. Although we have been inforzed

by CIA that the Bureau's jurisdiction and operational interests will not be

interfered with, we cannot discount the results of past experiences stemming

from CIA's operational and organizational deficiencies. We have no reasc. io

believe that there will be a revolutionary change of these conditions. It is.

therefore, incumbent upon you to be extremely alert for any breakdown of the

adherence to the ground rules. I emphasize that this is an area of activity

which must be closely monitored by each Special Agent in Charge.

You

should be certain that your personnel is adequately oriented so that the Bureau

can have the full benefit of any constructive suggestions pertaining to this

entire matter.

Director by SA Sam Papich in hisremorandum of 3/5/70 serves as

a sort of summary in which SA Papich indicates that he cannot

recall the names of other cases which resulted in CIA displeasure

or criticism, but does cite one instance "early in the 1950's"

in which we disseminated data from a source of unknown reliability

charging Allen Dulles as having been a communist and a spy

while in Europe.

By letter 3/22/52, we informed State and CIA that a

source of unknown reliability hud alleged that IPENTFFING

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

Reference is made to the memorandum W. C. Sullivan

to C. D. DeLoach dated 3/5/70; captionedi as above.

At that

time the Director was advised

this Division would make an

analysis of each situation cited in the memorandum of

Special Agent Sam J. Papich relative to grievances which CIA

might hold in connection with relations with the FBI.

Enclosed will be found an analysis of 38 items

(2 are contained in one memorandum, making a total of 37

memoranda),

In substance our analysis does not show any

real reason why CIA would raise any issue in connection with

37 out of the 38 items.

The recommended action in each of

these cases would logically close the mutter.

In one memorandum

the 37th item ense, It is recommended that a carelully wordec

letter to CiA outlining policy and the basic elements oi

intelligence and counterintelligence work affecting the

United States be sent to that Agency. The purpose of this is

to protect the Bureau by giving CIA a dance to make any

comments, if it has any, in regard to the current utilization

pf sources and facilities affecting both CIA and the Bureau.

If CIA replies that it is satisfied with the current intelli-

gence conditions in this area, we will qut this particular

matter to rest and we will have their letter in the file.

This Division will take any and all steps to comply

With the Director's wishes in this matüer and

in any other

concerning which this Division is involved.

BUREAU OPERATIONS IN MEXICO

EYRET

In 10/51, almost simultaneously, our Legats in

Mexico City, Madrid, and Paris, reported instances of CIA

officials openly challenging our operations, generallyk Act 6 (11B

on the grounds that we were violating CIA overseas

jurisdiction. Inspectors V. P. Keay and DeLoach personally

and forcefully brought these instances to the attention of

General Walter B. Smith, Director of CIA, in a heated exchange

on 10/24/51. Out of this meeting developed a luncheon on 11/7/51

attended by the Director, Bureau officials and General Smith,

who was accompanied by several officers of his Agency.

According to a memorandum, D. M. Laddto the Director, dated

pieceed, CIA recognized our presence abroad and both areacies

cooperation and coordination through greater liaison

so as to prevent conflict and competition in these closely

associated operations.

During the ensuing 19 years, the

Bureau continued to operate in Mexico and on occasions

moderately expanded its activities in order to meet its

needs. During this lengthy

period, there were no serious

problems with CIA, with reference to our Mexico City office.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

The FBI, of course, fully realizes the difficult problems

Involved in surveilling American communists in foreign countries

At the same time, however, it must be pointed out that in the present

emergency each individual

Communist investigation, routine or

otherwise, should receive proper attention when the subject concerned

travels to foreign countries.

As you no doubt realize, the Communist

Party, U.s.A,, represents a potential force as far as

espionage

members of the

Party could become involved in delicate operations:

As pointed out in the discussions between Mi. DeLoach and representa

Lives of your agency, the travels of Communists fron the United

States to Mexico are

very likely to become much greater, thereby

proposing a more serious problem than is now faced.

The FBI has for some time utilized the Immigration and

Naturalization Service Watch List as a source of information concerning

the travel of Comnunists. Although representing an excellent method

of ascertaining this type of information, at the same time the FBI

is not afforded any advance warning from

this source as to the return

of the Conmunist. Party member to the United States.

Therefore, the

investigation of that member becomes delinquent in

view of the

fact

active investigation 1s not initiated at the time of his re-entry.

It is, therefore, belleved that this particular source of information

would not be satisfactory in lieu of information from your agency

which would notify us in advance of the return to the United States

of the Communist Party member in question.

With respect to the FBI advising your agency when the

services of the Mexican Police may, be utilized in individual cases,

this Bureau will be most-happy to advise you of those "sensitive

cases" which are considered too delicate for reierral to the Mexican

Police, or foreign factions. With regard to the remainder

of

Investigations, however, we shall defer to your judgment as to

whether you wish to utilize the Mexican Police or not.

The

jurisdiction of the Office of Special Operations in foreign

intelligence matters allows for a more over all knowledge oi the

Mexican Police than this Bureau presently possesses. Thererore, we

suggest that you weigh the facts in each individual case and consider

whether the Mexican Police should be called in or not. -

Concerning the

ranking importance of cases, it is the

opinion of this

Bureau that the facts provided your agency in each

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

THE ABEL CASE

Item #3 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses the

Abel case.

According to Papich, CIA felt it was not given proper

recognition for its contribution in the case, in that it took the

risk and responsibility of transporting Hayhanen from Paris to the

U. S. in 1957 after the Bureau declined to become

involved in this

transportation; that after a short handling period in the U. S. the

Bureau dropped Hayhanen, an alcoholic, because he became a problem

and CIA took the responsibility of safeguarding him, giving the

Bureau free access to him and time to develop leads leading to the

apprehension of Abel; that CIA was responsible for making Hayhanen

mentally and physically capable to testify at the Abel trial; also,

CIA incurred heavy expenses, all for the benefit of the Bureau;

further, the Bureau never thanked CIA for its cooperation nor did it

see fit to inform the Attorney General or the White House of the

role played by CIA.

BACKGROUND OF THE SITUATION:

Abel is the Soviet intelligence officer who was uncovered

in the U. S. in 1957 through the defection of Reino Hayhanen,

Abel's assistant.

Mr. Belmont that Hayhanen had

that make en talked a the meet cass wised

Paris about three days ago and was referred to fIA. He claimed he

was a Soviet agent in New York since 1952 and gave certain details

to back up his

story.

He claimed he was ordered back to Moscow and

got "cold feet" in Paris and wanted to cooperate with American

officials.

He was in a highly emotional state which led CIA to

question his mental stability. It was the opinion of Mr. Belmont

that no steps should be taken

to return Haybanen to the U. S. until

the story was substantiated or demolished to reflect his actual

status.

Our New York Office immediately instituted investigation,

based on Hayhänen's disclosures and

was not able to prove or

disprove his story. On May S, 1957, CIA was informed of the

facts developed by our investigation and asked what action it

intended to take regarding Hayhanen's return to the U.S.

On

May 9, 1957, Angleton advised of a report received from CIA, Paris,

revealing that haynanen had sutiered almost a complete mental

breakdown and that in view of his condition, arrangements were

made by CIA for him to be returned to the U.S. by plane.

On

May 10, 1957, Hayhanen was returned to the U.s. in the company o

a CIA agent.

On arrival our New York Agents were at the airport

to take him over, but because of his emotional state, he was

to take hin overy. healen

confined at the U.S. Marine Hospital in Staten Island until

Hay 15, 1957, when he was released to the custody of our Agents.

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) authorities

irranged for his confinement in the U.s. Marine Hospital,

Staten Islar, for psychiatric examination through the U.S.

Public Realin service. (Liaison Agent Papich had previously

conferred with an INS official who had stated that if Hayhanen's

condition warranted confinement upon his arrival in the U.S.,

an order would have to be issued by the U.S. Public Health

Service).

Hayhanen and his wife were placed in a midtown hotel

by New York Agents and were under Bureau control from May 15, 1957,

until June 20, 1957, when they were taken to their residence

Peekskill, New York,

at their request. All expenses for their

maintenance were paid by the Bureau.

During this period Hayhanen

and his wife were becoming a problem because of heavy drinking

and irrational behavior.

On June 13, 1957, Abel was located by Bureau Agents when

visiting his studio in Brooklyn, New York, Ifforts by Bureau

Agents and the Department to have Hayhanen testify against Abel in a

crininal prosecution were unavailing.

With the Department's

concurrence, we arranged for INs authorities to arrest Abel on

June 21, 1957, on an alien warrant. After Abel's arrest, the

Department continued to raise questions concerning Hayhanen's

willingness to testify in an espionage

prosecution against Abel

and requested the Burea to press Hayhanen in that regard.

We

took the position that any efforts to induce layhanen to testify

should be made by the Department, as we realized that Hayhanen

would undoubtedly want assurances, such as remaining in this

country and financial assistance, and the Departnent was so

advised. The Department was also advised that the Bureau

would no longer pay liayhanen's subsistence and that other

arrangements would

have to be made.

In an effort to solicit

Haynanen's cooperation,

the Department conferred with Allen

Dulles of CIA to determine if CIA would be willing to sponsor

the entry of Hayhanen into the U.S. under the

authority granted

the Director of CIA by law. Dulles indicated a willingness

not only to sponsor Hayhanen but also to assist in his rehabilitation

in obtaining a job

and furnishing financial assistance for an extendea period

time.

On July 21, 1957 a CIA representative was placed

in touch with Hayhanen by New York Agents for this purpose!

Our Agents also arranged for FBI's access to Hayhanen whenever neces

sary.

Subsequently, Hayhanen agreed to testify and appeared

before a Federal grand jury on August 5 and August 6, 1957.

As indicated above, we located Abei on June 13 and

he was taken into custody by INS on June 21, 1957. On July 21,

1957, over a month later, CIA instituted arrangements for

Hayhanen's rehabilitation.

While CIA undoubtedly incurred heavy expenses on

Item No. 4 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70 discusses

belief by CIA officials that damaging publicity regarding

William P. Bundy emanated from a Bureau report. Bundy

was a CIA official at the time and the publicity was felt to

be damaging to CIA. CIA apparently was of the belief that

the Bureau leaked the information to Senator Joseph McCarthy

who then released the information to the press.

Bureau files reveal that in a discussion between

SA Papich and Allen W. Dulles, then head of CIA, on 7/10/53

Dulles inquired of Papich as to where McCarthy could get infor-

mation such as that released concerning Bundy. Papich

immediately informed Dulles that if Dulles was under any

suspicion that the Bureau might be disseminating such infor-

mation to Senator McCarthy he was definitely wrong and off base.

Papich also told Dulles that the results of the Bureau

investigation concerning Bundy had also been made available

to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as well as other

interested agencies. Dulles told Papich that he definitely

did not feel that the Bureau was involved in the McCarthy

releases to the press and that he was sorry if there had been

an impression he suspected the Bureau.

There is nothing in Bureau files concerning Bundy

which would indicate that the Bureau did, in fact, supply any

information concerning Bundy to Senator McCarthy or the news

media. There was considerable publicity concerning Bundy

at the time and it is noted that due to the fact that Bundy

was the son-in-law of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson

there was possibly an element of potential embarrassment to

the Democratic Party attendant to publicity afforded the

matter by Republican Senator McCarthy.

It is also noted

that copies of reports of Bureau investigation concerning

Bundy had been disseminated, in addition to CIA, to Civil

Service Commission, National security Agency, Atomic Energ.

Commission, Army and the Attorney General.

A conflict broke

out between CIA and Senator Joseph McCarthy after McCarthy

publicly quoted from a document, not identified, which spellec

out Bundy's contribution to the Alger Hiss fund.

The files

indicate that CIA alleged that the AEC had leaked the

information

in question to Senator McCarthy.

DECIASSIFIDD BYSPaAmIHE

Item number five in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich with his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses a question raised by

former CIA Director Allen Dulles concerning the propriety of FBI

dissemination of information concerning Jay Lovestone, who in the late

1920's headed the U. S. Communist Party, thereafter became completely

disillusioned with the Party, and subsequently occupied an executive position

with American Federation of Labor.

The particular information referred to by Mr. Dulles had been

furnished FBI by Spencer Miller, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Labor.

Miller made several accusations against CIA. Mr. Dulles took the position

that dissemination of the allegations to the White House, Attorney General

and Department of State had placed Dulles on the spot because the Miller

data was not a complete story.

BACKGROUND:

CIA advised that on 12/4/53 Miller had informed CIA representa-

tives abroad that he had evidence pointing toward Jay Lovestone's being a

communist and active agent, and that Lovestone might shortly be exposed

by the McCarthy Subcommittee of the Senate as the chief of the third great

Soviet ring after Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White. When interviewed by

Bureau 1/7/54 he furnished no information indicating that Lovestone was

engaged in espionage activity and appeared to have an axe to grind insofar as

Lovestone was concerned. He acknowledged everything hethad ceme to him

secondhand. Results of interview were furnished CIA by letter.

On 1/22/54 Attorney General advised the Director that Dr. Milton

Eisenhower had told him of a conversation he had with Spencer Miller. The

Attorney General said he told Dr. Eisenhower he would have Miller inter-

viewed to get the whole story and asked that we conduct the interview.

On 1/25/54 we wrote the Attorney General about the previous

interview with Miller and advised we would have him interviewed again to

secure any additional data he might have.

Miller was reinterviewed

the same day and results were sent to Attorney General 1/27/54.

Subsequently, on 2/19/54, Governor Sherman Adams called

(the Director from White House about the Miller situation. The

Director advised Governor Adams that he had personally talked to

Miller for two hours the previous day and had concluded that Miller

was obsessed with the charges he was making and while he appeared

to be a brilliant and well educated man he did not appear to have

specific details.

On the day the Director spoke with Miller, 2/18/54, he

reierred Miller to Domestic Intelligence Division where a detailed

interview was conducted and results incorporated in a 20-page memo-

randum, copies of which

were furnished Attorney General, Governor

Adams, CIA and State Department.

We interviewed Miller at the specific instructions of the

Attorney General based upon a White House request and dissemination

of interview results to Attorney General and White House was not

only proper but required under the circumstances. CIA and State

Department received results since allegations concerned officials

and operations of those agencies.

Miller furnished names of

persons who he said could support his allegations and we interviewed

them and disseminated results.

Mr. James Angleton of CIA commented

on 3/13/54 that when the Miller information was first received at

that Agency some officials gained the impression FBI was deliberately

collecting and disseminating data solely for the purpose

of "hurting"

CIA. Angleton said results of interviews and investigation conducted

by Bureau had clearly demonstrated to CIA officials that IBl was

Jiving by its well-known tradition and reputation of developing

¡facts and reporting information in an impartial manner.

on the previous day all officials, including Dulles, commented the

Bureau was following the Lovestone case in conformity with its

well established reputation of getting all the facts.

this, there is no basis for believing that at this time CIA would

raise any charges of unfair conduct on the part of Bureau in its

handling of the Miller matter.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue

of this matter.

Item six in material submitted to the Director by Sam

Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 mentions occasions in the 1950's

when CIA complained that officials visiting the United States

under CIA sponsorship were disappointed because they had no

contact with Bureau officials.

CIA felt contact with Bureau

officials had significant benefits, left lasting favorable

impressions because of the FBI's world-wide reputation, and

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials

they were left with suspicions there was friction between the

FBI and CIA.

that tours for such visitors would be of a restrictive nature

and they would be afforded the same treatment as the public

and nothing more.

Memorandum 5/31/56 from Mr. Roach to Mr. Belmont,

captioned "Visit at Bureau by Foreign Police and Intelligence

Officials," (Bureau file 94-2-32781) recommended for Director's

approval that Liaison would (1) inform CIA tours afforded to

foreign police officials and security officials would continue

to be of a restricted'nature and the visitors will only view

facilities normally seen by the public, and (2) that such

foreign officials would not be interviewed unless it appeared

not

The Director noted in

regard to 2, "I see no need of interviews."

Doctor Otto John was an official of the West German

security service who was closely associated with CIA and who

was alleged to have defected to the East Germans.

In his memorandum, Papich emphasized that for the past

several years there was no basis for complaints with regard to

Bureau treatment of foreign officials coming to U.S. under CIA

told that in view of this, the Bureau notified State Department

that any requests for information from the Dutch to be handled (5

Mr. Belmont said that this was a situation created by the

SUBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CIA

COL. JOHN GROMBACH (PAT O'BRIEN)

Background: Item number eight in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his: memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

relations between Bureau and CIA with Grombach, head of private

intelligence network (O'Brien was Grombach's aide who had liaison

with Bureau) •

Problem: Papich states we never informed CIA we were receiving

Information from Grombach which was also of interest to CIA;

and that while it is possible Grombach had given same data to

CIA, we do not know.

CIA and Bureau jointly. O'Brien, for example, told us of

it was agreed information might be furnished directly to FBI by

Grombach, provided CIA was advised by Grombach of what was given.

(62-77306-23) Moreover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested

Bureau's views regarding validity of information we were receiving

from Grombach and asked for our views regarding method to be

employed in channeling information from Grombach to Bureau.

In the ensuing period, dispute arose between CIA and

Grombach over channeling of information and Bureau made every

effort to stay out of dispute. In late 1952, for example, Helms

inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination had changed.

He was told they certainly had not and again informed that Bureau's

desire was to receive all information of interest no matter how

received. (62-77306-27) Our position of not becoming involved in

On the other hand, there were instances where we

received information from Grombach which was of either an

administrative or intelligence interest to CIA and we did

not inform CIA.

These instances covered period both prior

and subsequent to the contractural relationship between CIA

and Grombach

which was from 4/51 to 7/54 (62-77306, unrecorded

memo 11/29/55, Belmont to Boardman re Grombach). For example,

Grombach wrote a confidential letter dated 7/30/48 to former

Assistant to the Director D. M. Ladd which contained infor-

mation of interest to CIA.

This letter contains a penciled

notation: "This info, not to be given to CIA. per DML--OHB"

(62-77306-7).

Memorandum 10/11/50 from A. H.

Belmont to

Mr. Ladd

contains information from O'Brien concerning

Grombach's intentions to plant microphones in Finland to

cover meetings attended by Russian high staff.

It was

observed in the. memorandum that at that time O'Brien

and

Grombach had no relations- with CIA and that Grombach's

intended operation was under primary responsibility of CIA.

No indication this information given to CIA by Bureau

(65-58725-10) •

O'Brien furnished Bureau a memorandum

dated

6/29/54 entitled "Termination Memorandum to FBI" which

informed of the termination of contract between Grombach

and CIA.

In the memorandum it is pointed out that Grombach

will continue to receive raw material from the field and

that while he will no longer be in a position to translate,

evaluate, publish, etc., Grombach desires to forward such

material

to Bureau as Grombach would not trust any other

agency.

The memorandum also states that Grombach has continued

the flow to the Bureau of all reports he felt Bureau would

be interested in even though Grombach received a written

order specifically directing him to not give Bureau any

thing: (62-77306-70).

Item number nine in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

the Hoover Commission survey of CIA operations in 1954. According

to Papich, there was talk within CIA that the Bureau had furnished

the names of subversives within CIA to Senator McCarthy.

Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wisc) was Chairman of the Senate

Investigations

Subcommittee.

General

Mark Clark headed the Task Force which

surveyed CIA operations between 9/54 and 6/55.

In 10/54, CIA

alleged that the McCarthy Committee was attempting to develop

information regarding CIA operations.

According to the Washington

Star, 10/1/54, McCarthy said CIA was

"one of the worst situations

we have as far as communist infiltration is concerned."

He said

he would give his data relative to this matter to Clark's Task

Force.

According to the Washington Star, 1/15/55, McCarthy

said he had given Clark information relative to alleged communist

infiltration of CIA.' As of 1/17/55, CIA had not received from

Clark the names of those considered security risks but CIA

believed it had done a good job of removing security risks and

believed that it was in good shape.

On 1/21/55, the Task Force requested name checks on

security risks named by McCarthy.

Memoranda containing

results of those checks were given to the Task Force on 2/8/55.

On 5/13/55, the Bureau received a letter from Clark asking for

investigations relative to character, reputation, and loyalty

of individuals mentioned as security risks. CIA was aware of

the names as we asked it for identifying data concerning them.

Clark was later advised that the investigations would entail

interviews at CIA, review of its programs, inquiries in foreign

countries, and the like and he withdrew his request.

The observations of Special Agent Papich in this

The Manual

include collection, collation, evaluation, coordination and

Martinez furnished

to evaluate reliability of the information. CIA suggested possibility

that the information had been fabricated or was part of a communist

deception operation. CIA requested

that we identify our source but

we declined to do so because source did not want his identity disclosed.

By letter dated October 1, 1959, the new Legat, Rio,

information Martinez had furnished was of such a nature that it

Legat also concluded that Martinez could not have been a

provocator used by Czechs to pass deceptive information.

Contacts with Martinez were discontinued in November, 1959. (5)

In our dissemination of information from Martinez to

CIA we were careful to state that our contacts with the source

were insufficient to establish his reliability. Although

subsequent events established that it was likely that cIA was

correct in speculating that the information was fabricated,

there was no

The problem was predicated on situations which might arise as

CIA REQUEST FOR BUREAU LECTURE

DECLASSIP TED BY SPALMIKE

en 1-10-01

ON COMMUNISM IN THE U. S.

Item Number 15 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses the Director's

refusal of a 1958 CIA request for Mr. W. C. Sullivan to lecture

on communism before a CIA group. Papich stated that CIA accepted

this as an affront and a blatant refusal to cooperate on a most

important subject of interest to both agencies.

The files disclose that by letter 9/25/58 signed by

James Angleton, CIA requested Mr. Sullivan to address a selected

group of CIA personnel on the communist movement in the U. S.

CIA suggested dates of 12/9,10,or 11/58.

The Director by routing

slip attached to Angleton's

letter commented, "It seems strange

that CIA should seek this when its top representative in Japan

considers FBI as a bunch of mere 'flat-feet" and the dangers

of communism as something conjured up in the minds of the FBI.

But then again I note request doesn't come from the Director

nor even the Deputy Director of CIA."

Memorandum W. C. Sullivan to A. Belmont dated 10/1/58

made reference to CIA's request ard the Director's comments.

It

recommended that the best interests of the Bureau would be served

by giving this lecture, not because of the information which

could be conveyed to CIA on communism in the U.S., but because

it would give Sullivan an opportunity to raise a number of

questions himself of the group concerning CIA's own activities

in the field of communism. It was pointed out that it could be

considered a bit of a challenge to see how much the FBI could

learn about the operation of CIA during the course of the lecture

and discussion rather than the converse. •Mr. Tolson recommended

that the request be declined and the Director concurred commenting,

"We cannot make Sullivan available to this outfit."

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA - TRAVEL OF

BUREAU INFORMANTS TO CUBA

Item Number 19 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

the possible travel of one of our Mexican border informants

to Cuba and whether our not advising CIA of this made us

potentially vulnerable to charges we were operating outside

the U.s. without coordinating with CIA.

BACKGROUND:

This involved our plans to send a Border Coverage

Program (BOCOV) informant to a guerrilla training camp in

byed our

Cuba. The trip never materialized.

In October, 1965, we were vitally interested in

determining the location and extent of Cuban guerrilla training

sites being used to prepare Latin American subversives to carry

out revolutions in their home countries.

EP ST4-S, a Mexican

national residing in Juarez, Mexico, which is within the area

covered by the BOCOV Program, had infiltrated Cuban and Chinese

intelligence operations in Mexico City and had made himself

attractive to Mexican communist leaders who were planning to

pay expenses of sending guerrilla trainees to Cuba.

CIA CONSIDERATIONS:

EP 572-S was an integral part of our top secret

BOCOV Program which is handled on a need-to-know basis.

had previously obtained material from CIA showing its primary

targets inside Cuba which allowed us to fully brief the informant

as to overall U.S. Government objectives and a procedure was

established for use in disseminating data to CIA if the trip

materialized which would fully protect our informant and not

jeopardize the BOCOV operation.

OUTCOME:

During period informant was striving to arrange the

trip to Cuba his wife became mentally ill, extremely emotional

and temporarily deserted the informant. This strained family

relationship

caused us to order El Paso to have informant cancel

efforts to make the trip to Cuba and thus no trip was ever made.

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his

memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph

dated 5/5/65 and entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic."

Special Agent (SA) Papich stated that due to the urgency of the

document Bureau did not obtain CIA clearance to include CIA

information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested

agencies, including CIA. According to SA Papich, CIA never

made any

protest although it considered our action a violation

of the "third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did

contain CIA data, it also set forth highly significant data

obtained by Bureau through our own informants.

The CIA data

was biographical in nature and was used in the monograph to

characterize the past, including communist contacts, of key

figures in the Dominican Republic. It was taken from the 1963

CIA Biographical Handbook and CIA telegrams dating back to 1961,

all of which were previously disseminated to the U. S. intelligence

community by CIA.

No attempt was made in the monograph to

characterize CIA data as Bureau information and, in fact,

information was attributed to "another Government agency," in.

accordance with established procedures.

2024

this

The so-called "third

agency rule" provides that

classified information originating in a department or agency

will not be disseminated

outside the receiving agency without

the permission of the originating agency. However, an exception

to this rule provides that the receiving

agency may disseminate

such data to other members of the U. S. Intelligence Board

(USIB),

of which Bureau is a

member, unless the originating agency

uses appropriate control markings limiting its data

to the

use of

the receiving agency only.

The CIA data used in the

Bureau monograph had no such control markings and our monograph

was disseminated to the President, the Attorney General and

USIB members only.

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

Bureau operation of informants in Guatemala, and comments on

our potential vulnerability for not having informed CIA at

the inception of the operation of these informants.

(s)

SA Papich has cited two situations. The first

concerns

koberto francisco castaneda felice, an attorney

residing in Guatemala City Our Legat, Mexico, in the Fall

of 1966, identified Castaneda as a potential source of intelligence

information of importance to U.S. security; conducted

appropriate background inquiry regarding him and determined

his excellent potential and willingness to furnish intelligence

information to U.S. Government.

By memorandum 11/23/66 it was

approved that we contact CIA headquarters through liaison

channels to inform CIA that we planned to maintain contact with

Castaneda; that CIA would be furnished the information obtained

and that we would service CIA requests provided they could be

handled with complete security.

• SA Papich so informed|

stated he saw no reason

why FBI could not proceed as we

desired and that CIA headquarters

would so inform its representatives

I<S)

instructing them to give FBI all necessary support in this

operation.

Since that date we have operated Castaneda as a

valuable and productive unpaid confidential source.

Since this

matter was coordinated with CIA at the outset, there appears to

be no problem.

The second situation cited by SA Papich concerned

Legat, Mexico, informant MEX-65. This individual has cooperated

with the Bureau for

official in 1945-47, Some 25 years.

by our Legat, Mexico, in Mexico.

We advised CIA that we had utilized MEX-65 for handling

0N 1-11-0.

Item (22), SOLO, in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

mentions that the Bureau could be vulnerable and charged with

failure to identify the source and coordinate with them on

this matter if they were to become cognizant of the high-level

foreign ramifications of this operation.

SOLO is the code word used to refer to the liaison

operation performed by our informants between the Communist

Party, USA, (CPUSA), and other communist parties of the world.

This operation basically is performed to gain

high-level intelligence concerning the Soviet Union's

financial support, domination and control of the CPUSA.

Attendant to this objective, our informants have met with and

discussed mutual problems with leaders of the various inter-

national departments within the Soviet Government.

They have

also held discussions with CP leaders from other nations.

All information received as a result of this operation

which has foreign ramifications has been promptly disseminated

to CIA at the highest level.

It has not been considered desirable to identify our

sources in this case in view of. the sensitivity of the case

and the physical danger to the informants.

Considerable security precautions have

been carefully

built into the SOLO operation both in the field and at the

Seat of Government to insure the fullest protection to its

security and to the safety of the informants involved. Exposure

of the identity of these sources might jeopardize the entire

operation.

Item #23 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses a letter

dated November 15, 1967, from CIA which requested that the Bureau

check telephone toll calls from the home of one Robert Kenneth Brown

who was allegedly harassing CIA

Brown was

supposedly seeking information concerning CIA's covert operations.

SA Papich states that we told CIA that we would not check the toll

calls on the basis that the information received was not sufficient

to justify investigation within the Bureau's jurisdiction. SA Papich

also states that

• "CIA accepted our response but there is no doubt

that the Agency characterized our position as a concrete example of

refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating to the

security of U.S. intelligence operations."

D. J. Brennan, JI., to Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated November 17,

A review of Bureau files disclosed that a memorandul 9a7,

was prepared.

recommended

This memorandum encompassed the above facts and

that CIA Liaison Agent advise CIA that we would not

check the toll calls as requested. This memorandum and recommendation

was prepared by SA Papich. The pirector noted "OK H."

In addition

to the above, on December 9, 1967, Brown

contacted our Miami Office and stated that he was writing a book

about CIA and offered to make the material available to the Miami

Office. Our Miami Office was advised that this information was of

' interest to CIA headquarters and instructions were furnished that

:If Brown did furnish Miami with the information, it would be given

to CIA. Brown. did not follow through with his offer.

On TO

Item number 24 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70

discusses the restriction of dissemination of the Current

Intelligence Analysis (CINAL) to Central Intelligence Agency

(CIA) • Prior to 10/67, some of the Government agencies on

the distribution list for CINAL received multiple copies.

The Director of CIA was then receiving 19 copies of CINAL

as a result of requests from CIA on 3/30/62 and 10/23/62 for

additional copies to expedite reading by key CIA officials

and to facilitate rapid utilization of the information

within CIA.

The Director made a notation on the 10/4/67 CINAL:

"Please look over list of distribution. I have marked with

a dot those I question as to why they should recieve copies

and I do not think more than I copy should be sent anyone.

Let me have your views. H." By memorandum R. W. Smith to

W. C. Sullivan 10/6/67, it was stated that although security

of the classified document CINAL had been maintained, if the

Director so desired, we would tell recipients that they would

recieve onLy one copy each in the tuture. Mr. lolson noted

on this memorandum, "Yes.

T 10/9." Mr. Tolson also noted,

"We could never run down a leak."

The Director noted, "Send

only I copy & if any inquiry, then indicate we have had to

cut costs. H."

Since 10/67 the Director's instructions have been

followed and only one copy of CINAL has been furnished to

those, including CIA, on the CINAL distribution list.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set forth,

that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

Director, Allen Dulles, later expressed disappointment that we

did not contact CIA beforehand but that an agreement satisfactory

Papich also says that

in late 1959 we gave consideration to establishing a Legat in

Denmarks but did not inform CIA of our intentions.

In contemplation of the stationing of a Legat in Denmark,

Bulet of 12/7/59 instructed Legat, London, to broaden liaison

contacts in scandinavian countries and told Legat, Bonn, to make

exploratory contacts with appropriate authorities in Holland (S)

for the same purpose.

Since we had told State by letter of 3/10/55

that we would handle requests for investigations and name checks

for the Dutch only when received through formal State channels,

we advised State of our intention to make exploratory contacts with

points out that DCID 5/2 has been controversial since its

inception (12-8-59) and the subject of differences of inter-

pretation.

We recognized CIA's coordination responsibilities

but, in this instance, were of the opinion there was no operational

angle and no necessity for coordinating dissemination of above

since we had previously given the information to CIA.

This

memorandum recommended approval of a letter to CIA answering

CIA's inquiry according to above. Director indicated "O.K.

On

Item 27 of the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 indicates that Wise and

Ross had visited the Bureau in 1963 to gather material for a

book regarding U. S. intelligence agencies.

It was suggested

that CIA be advised of this, and the Director noted, "I see no

reason for doing

so."

Mr. Jones' memorandum to Mr. DeLoach, 8/28/63, reports

this visit

and notes that Wise had asked for data concerning

the Bureau's internal security procedures and had asked concerning

other FBI operations, making no reference to CIA, with one

exception.

He did inquire as to whether there was friction between

the two agencies and was told that we cooperated closely and

maintained daily liaison with CIA. It was on this memorandum

that the Director said he saw no reason for informing CIA con-

cerning the visit of Wise and Ross.

We later learned that their book, "The Invisible

Government," was furnished in the form of advance proofs to

CIA prior to its publication. We also received such proofs

from CIA through Liaison.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None.

We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this mattey.

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Samm

Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations

Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,

CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to

assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by

providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist

Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa.

His memorandum added that we told that agency the FBI had no

informants available because they were necessary for our own

operations.

He claims we took the position since we saw no

benefit to be gained by loaning an informant on a short or

long term basis.

He states that CIA could argue that as early

as 1960 it had foresight to recognize the need for additional

coverage and when it appealed to the Bureau for assistance,

He refers to his memorandum dated 4/7/60

concerning this matter captioned "Communist Activities in Africa."

The memorandum referred to discloses

that on 4/5/60

Herman Horton, Deputy Chief, Counterintelligence, CIA, stated

that communist organizations were rapidly increasing in strength

on the continent of Africa and that his agency found it most

difficult to establish effective penetration.

Horton noted that

in this connection it was almost impossible for a white man to

move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable

him to develop worthwhile sources. He asked if the Bureau would

consider furnishing one of its

Negro informants or developing an

informant in the Communist Party, USA for eventyal use by CIA in

Africa.

Papich told Horton that if the Bureau had a good Negro

informant, we certainly were not interested in having his future

jeopardized nor did we want to lose his production.

Papich

added that it undoubtedly would be most difficult to take a Bureau

informant, have him'travel to Africa under some cover and still

be able to satisfactorily explain such activities to his communist

colleagues without becoming a target of suspicion. Horton said

he recognized all this but asked if the Bureau would give

consideration.

Item #29 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in memorandum of 3/5/70, states that by Bureau

letter dated 10/23/64 we provided the

White House information

received by our Legat from U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg wherein

the latter was critical of intelligence operations, particularly

the overstaffing of personnel. SA Papich comments

that we do

not know if CIA became knowledgeable regarding this letter but

could construe same as relating to its operations.

Our Legat, Paris, in a letter to the Director dated

10/19/64, set forth

the results of a conversation with Ambassador

William R. Pivkin at Luxembourg. The latter was assigned by the

State Department to conduct a survey of the U.S. intelligence

operations in six Luropean countries, assisted by representative:

of Defense, State Department, and Bureau of the Budget.

Rivkin

remarked that the results of

the survey were appalling, there

being 23, 000 military personnel in the six countries engaged in

intelligence operations and numerous CIA personnel.

He described

the lack of coordination between the military and CIA as

"scandalous." He stated the Offices of the Military Attaches

were grossly overstaffed and he was recommending drastic cuts

and that duplicate administrative services be combined with those

of the embassies.

He made no mention of specific intelligence

operations nor did he elaborate on the lack of coordination.

Rivkin commented that on his return to the U.s., he intended

to

see the President personally to bring this matter forcefully to

his attention.

Rivkin's comments were incorporated in a letter to

William D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, dated

10/23/64,

in accordance with the Director's noted instructions.

Our files disclose no indication that CIA cognizant of Bureau

letter.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: None.

facts set forth, that CIA will make

Item number 30 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970,

discusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1963, as a

result

of a communication the Bureau sent to the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). It was pointed out that

in our communication

• to PFIAB we attributed certain information

to McCone, then Director of ClA, concerning the matter of

increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments. McCone

charged that the information attributed to him was not so

because he had never made any such statement and he could

prove it.

The fact was that the information relating to

McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had

indicated the information originated with McCone.

McCone

maintained that we should have checked with him

before going

on record that any information had originated with him.

A review of the file in this matter discloses that

in April, 1963, Mr. Belmont along with Papich had discussed

with Richard Helms and James Angleton of CIA McCone's alleged

position with the PFIAB; that he was in favor of across the

Bureau, of course, wasopposed to this and advised

Helms that

we would request to make our position known beiore the board.

At the conclusion of the meeting in April, 1953, Helms

specifically asked what he should tell McCone and Mr. Belmont

told him he should tell McCone exactly what had occurred at

the meeting; that the Bureau was opposed to across the board

wire taps and the Bureau intended to so advise PFIAB.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:'

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of

this matter.

SUBJECT IONSHIPS WITH CIA

ALLEGED PENETRATIONS OF CIA

Item number 31, "alleged penetration of CIA," in the

'material

submitted to the Director by SA Sam Papich

• in his

memorandum of 3/5/70 discusses allegations made by

Anatoliy Mikhailovich Golitzyn regarding recruitment of four

CIA employees by the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB),

that CIA requested full investigation which we declined.

BACKGROUND OF CASE

Golitzyn, an intelligence officer of the

KGB who detected to CIA in 1961, alleged that the KGB had

penetrated CIA through an individual having the code name "Sasha."

In an effort to identify this penetration CIA provided Golitzyn

with information regarding many individuals who had worked for

CIA in Germany.

Golitzyn identified two individuals at various times

as "Sasha" and in each instance investigation

"washed out" the

identification. Golitzyn finally identified "Sasha" as one

During the course of

extensive document reviews Golitzyn became acquainted with

background of various individuals who had worked in Germany at

the timel

did. Golitzyn identified four present employees

of CIA with unknown subjects who had come to his attention while

he was active in the KGB.

PROBLEM WITH CIA

CIA wanted the Bureau to undertake full-

scale investigation of its four employees based solely on

Golitzyn's allegations.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA

By letter of February 26, 1965, CIA

was informed there appeared to be no basis at that time for a

full-scale investigation of these men by the FBI on the basis of

allegations by Golitzyn. With regard to any investigation in the

United States concerning two of the men, a conclusion would be

nade following completion of the investigation o

nd interviews of and his wife.

Based upon the investigation

of

and the interviews of

Jand his wife, CIA was

informed by letter of July 20, 1965,

that nothing

Item number 32 in material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam J. Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

mentions Bureau letter 5/16/58 sent to the then Vice

President Nixon and containing a summary of CIA informa~

tion concerning events in Latin America relating to

Mr. Nixon's trip there during 5/58.

According to SA Papich, most of the information

in above letter came from CIA.

He commented that this

letter could be interpreted as raising question concerning

quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America. Papich noted

it is not known if CIA ever became aware of the letter.

Papich stated that General Robert Cushman, currently Deputy

Director of CIA, was attached to the then

Vice President

Nixon's staff. SA Papich pointed out that CIA, if aware of

above letter,

could raise question as to violation of Third

Agency Rule.

source of the information set forth in our letter.

The last

paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the

impression gained from a review of CIA reports indicates that

CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles

concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter

also stated as follows:

"It is significant that information in the indi-

vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your

arrival in a particular country.

Therefore, there is a

question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist

organizations which would have led to the development of

information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of

your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding

instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1950.

The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director

had

a discussion with Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as

the first sentence of the above

letter reads as

follows:

"Apropos of our discussion today, there is set

forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency

reports received from them on May 14, 1958."

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to

Mr. Nixon is contained in a memorandum Mr. R. R. Roach. to

Mr. A. H. Belmont dated May 15, 1958, which was prepared for

the Director's information. The Director noted on this memo-

randum, "Send summary to A. G. H." In accordance with

instructions, a letter was sent to the then Attorney General

under date of May 16, 1958, and this letter contained a summary

of CIA information in the

190 game

same manner.as had been sent to

Mx. Nixon on May 16, 1958.

Our letter to the Attorney General,

however, did not contain any observations regarding.CIA

coverage in Latin American countries visited by Mr. Nixon and

his party.

Our file in this matter (62-88461-150) indicates that

on June 9, 1958, Colonel Robert Cushman in the office of the

then Vice

President Nixon contacted the Bureau at the request

of Mr. Nixon to determine if the contents of a letter from

dateh Mao

the Director to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, regarding

Mr. Nixon's trip to South America could be leaked to the

press.

Colonel Cushman's request was set forth in memorandum

G. A. Nease to Mr. Tolson June 9, 1958, with the recommenda-

tion that Colonel

Cushman be advised that if the information

were to be given to the press, it would undoubtedly create a

serious problem as the FBI would then have violated CIA's

confidence since CIA was aware that SA Papich had reviewed

CIA's classified reports and, therefore, this information

should not be given to the press.

Both Mr. Tolson and the

Director agreed with the recommendation, and Colonel Cushman

was advised of our decision. It is noted that Colonel Cushman

is identical with the individual

• who is now Deputy Director

of CIA.

Comments on Remarks in SA Papich Memo 3/5/70

I. That most of the information in our letter to

Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, came from CIA and that this

it the

letter could be interpreted as raising the question concerning

the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

There is no dispute as to the source of the informa-

regard to any question being raised as to the quality of

CIA's coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to

Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader

of the clA reports - - that 15,

that the information from CIA

popped up rather suddenly as related to the country anc

Mr. Nixon's arrival. Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since he

was personally involved in demonstrations directed

against

him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that

advance information from our responsible intelligence agency

(CIA) may have been

lacking.

2.

We are not aware if CIA became knowledgeable of

our letter

to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958. Under ordinary

conditions, we are not aware nor do we seek to identify any CIA

personnel who might be assigned to the White House staff.

As indicated above, Colonel Cushman, who was a member of

Mr. Nixon's staff in 1958 and who is now a Deputy Director

of CIA, was aware of our 5/16/58 letter and its contents.

We have no information that CIA ever registered any type of

protest in this matter.

3. That CIA technically could raise a question

as to violation of the Third Agency Rule as regards our

5/16/58 letter to Mr. Nixon.

The Third Agency Rule is intended to prohibit a

Government agency from disseminating information originating

with another Government agency in the absence of specific

authority to do so, and we follow this rule unless there

are overriding reasons. With regard to our letter to

Mr. Nixon dated 5/16/58, we set forth information clearly

identified as having originated with CIA. This letter

was apparently prepared at the specific request of then

Vice President Nixon after conferring with the Director.

Item number 33 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam J. Papich in his memorandum

3/5/70 discusses Herbert Itkin as an individual who was operated

as a criminal informant by the Bureau who furnished valuable

information and who has been a key witness in the prosecution

of cases being handled by the Bureau. Mr. Papich states that

the Bureau acquired access to Itkin through the CIA and that

although the CIA has never officially made any statements to the

Bureau, it has been bitterly disappointed that the Bureau never

acknowledged CIA's assistance which the agency considered

extremely valuable.

Memorandum dated 2/20/63 from W. C. Sullivan to

Mr. Belmont captioned "James Hoffa" set out that James Angleton

of CIA advised SA Papich that CIA had briefed the Attorney General

concerning a source whom Mr. Angleton had used since World War II

and who subsequently has developed a close association with a

lawyer who does considerable work for the Teamsters Unions.

Angleton's source was confident that the lawyer could be developed

as a penetration which could "sink" Hoffa and all of his cohorts.

The Attorney General agreed with the CIA representatives that the

matter should be referred to the Bureau for handling.

Mr. Angleton set up the first contact! with the individual

who had the contact with the attorney and at that time Angleton

stated that he did not want to get involved in any. investigative

aspects and wanted to step out of the matter as soon as possible.

As a result, eventual contact was made with Herbert Itkin who

developed into a very productive source. Itkin has been publicly

identified as both a source of the FBI and CIA as a result of his

testimony.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

HERBERT ITKIN

I SECRET

The Bureau's success in handling Itkin can be

attributed to the know-how of the SAs of the New York

Office because Itkin is a highly emotional individual

and he had aggravated marital problems, severe pressures

from his many business associates; therefore, it took

a high degree of skill in dealing with this source in

order to achieve the success that we did.

While it is acknowledged that CIA put us

originally in touch with this source, it was not

believed that it is essential that we go back to CIA

and explain to them our success or to thank them for

giving us this original lead. It is also noted that

there is an obligation upon Government agencies to

cooperate in the fullest and CIA's cooperation in this

matter was in accordance with the long standing policy

among all Government agencies.

Review of Itkin's file does not reflect any

instance where CIA indicated a displeasure in the Bureau

not acknowledging CIA's assistance in placing us in touch

with Itkin. This is in line with Mr. Angleton's statement

in 1963 that he did not want to get involved in any

investigative aspects of this matter and wanted to step

out as soon as possible. In view of the above, it is not

believed that CIA would have any basis to complain that the

Bureau never acknowledged CIA's assistance.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Item number 34 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 concerns

exchange of technical information with CIA, particularly as

it related to the technical surveillance field. Papich states

CIA exhibited its equipment to us,

but for many years we declined

to show any of our devices, with some exceptons. •he states

that CIA never made an official protest but informally indicated

from time to time that the lack of exchange was prejudicial to

overall intelligence and internal security interests and implied

we were more open with the British in this area than with CIA.

Papich states this situation does not exist today as there is

a good exchange by the Bureau and CIA.

Our files reveal that through the years CIA has

furnished

the Bureau a number of technical devices for our use

or inspection.

They have also furnished technical manuals obtained

abroad and briefed us on operational and technical aspects of

some of their operations abroad.

Laboratory personnel have been

afforded tours and briefings concerning CIA facilities and

equipment and in two instances Bureau personnel have been afforded

training at CIA schools. As recently as October, 1969; CIA

afforded a briefing to Bureau personnel concerning a Clandestine

Transmitter Activator, developed by their technical people and

offered to loan us one of these units as well as afford our

personnel training in the operation of the equipment.

COMMENTS OF THE LABORATORY

Similarly, Bureau records show substantial reciprocity

on the part of the FBI in developing and furnishing important

technical information to CIA over a period of many years.

Representative examples are cited below:

Prior to 1955 an important unsolved technical

intelligence problem involved desired access to

protected by combination-type locks (safe doors, and

the like).

Scientists in the FBI Laboratory were

able to solve this problem by using X-rays from

radioactive materials to "see" into the interior of

a combination lock and thus recover the combination,

without trace of tampering or other indication that

the lock had been compromised. This was a scientific

breakthrough of tremendous intelligence potential and,

with Bureau

approval, our results and techniques were

made known to the appropriate CIA representatives.

CIA advised

that they had theretofore spent thousands

of dollars in an intensive, but unsuccessful effort to

solve the same problem.

The impact of this scientific

discovery in permitting access to previously unavailable

intelligence had tremendous value for both the FBI and

CIA.

In approxmately the late 50's and early 60's, both CIA

and FBI encountered a new, highly sophisticated type

of secret writing placed into use by the Russians for

communicating with espionage agents. In spite of a

municating with espio

massive technical effort mounted by CIA, scientists

of the FBI Laboratory were successful in first unraveling

the basic principles and techniques underlying this new

Russian system.

This important breakthrough thus permitted

for the first time a successful attack against the new

Russian secret ink communication system.

Because of its

extreme intelligence potential, with prior Bureau approval,

this development was made known to CIA, and its importance

to CIA is reflected in part by a letter addressed to the

Director of FBI by Allen W. Dulles, then Director of CIA,

under date of August 19, 1961, in which Dulles said, in

part, "For the past several years there has been

increasingly effective technical liaison between the

Technical Services Division of this Agency and correspond-

ing components of your Bureau. • ." Dulles further

commented that Bureau technical personnel had "

.. • made

an outstanding technical contribution for which they are to

be highly .commended.

Their work not only has an important

impact in one sensitive area, but also has revealed a

chemical mechanism from which may well stem new high-level

secret writing systems. The discovery will have an

important influence on the discharge of responsibilities

value of close technical liaison between our two

organizations. . ."

Subsequently, again with prior Bureau approval, whenever

it could be done without jeopardizing FBI operational

interests, the FBI on a continuing basis made available

to CIA actual Soviet secret writing chemicals and methods

of development which had come into the possession of the

Bureau through investigative activity and through high-

level informants. A recent example involved the Russian.

espionage case of Herbert William Boeckenhaupt wherein

on 2/12/69 a sample of secret writing material used by

Boeckenhaupt to communicate with the Russians was

furnished to CIA by a representative of the FBI Laboratory.

The above items are representative outstanding examples

of FBI cooperation in developing and sharing highly important

technical information, and certainly the letter from CIA reflects

(the satisfaction and

importance which CIA attached to such

information received from the Bureau. Within general Bureau

policy guidelines, there were, of course, on a continuing basis

numerous other items of technical information shared with CIA

over the years, including briefings and exchange of visits.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None.

We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA vill make an issue of this matter.

Items number 35 and 36 in the material submitted to the

CIA has never understood why Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to

lecture at our schools and CIA was unhappy regarding our attitude

concerning exchange of information in the training field.

CIA by letter May 19, 1950, requested it be permitted to

discuss training problems with

FBI training staff in view of

necessity of its maintaining relations with foreign police and

security agencies. Following recommendations by the Executives

1950, that we did

not believe FBI training

cot beenere fur trining statt could intelligently discuss traintne

methods with CIA since our staff was not knowledgeable concerning

conditions encountered by CIA in various foreign countries.

Since 1962, we have taken foreign police officers into the

after

graduation certain

selective officers have been in touch with

CIA through AID. We are aware that CIA has used many of these

graduates as sources of information.

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief

that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance

in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.

Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich

to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy

of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that

more aggressive action should have been taken in field of

collecting positive intelligence in the United States.

Papich

notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been

restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when

political crises occur in some country.

He points out CIA belief

that acquiring needed data would mean

increased technical surveil-

lance coverage, development of informants and collection of

cryptographic material.

cites two specific cases occurring

in 1969 where Bureau

declined CIA's request for technical coverage,

suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the .

Attorney General.

Review of specific cases mentioned set forth

with Director's comments relative thereto being noted.

Our

policy of cooperation with cla most recently delinated to field

by SAC Letter 66-10 (B) - copy attached.

DETAILS:

SECREI

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive

order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of

such information.

He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and

that facets of these investigations of violations of United States

laws serve

to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred

to by us as investigations of internal security matters. Papich

notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

field

has been restricted to the compliance with requests by

State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring

in some foreign country.

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of

vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development

and collection of cryptographic material. According to Papich,

CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area

and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the

problem.

Papich cites two cases Alfred S. Gonsalves, J10/69 and

This specifically covered the cases

of Consalves and shapirol The Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,

changes inherent in faster

communication, hysteria to facilitate

international travel

and in response to requests from CIA,

the

Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA

regarding

that Agency's operational activities in the United States.

On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with

CIA,

the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our

guard down as CIA has always outsmarted us because of our

gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the

field and Bureau offiçials results of the conferences with CIA

and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction in

the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)

emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement

upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness to

cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the

United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director

noted "I hope

there is no 'sneaker' in this.

Time will tell."

There has been no renewed request from CIA for

technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there

been any indication that such requests have been

sent. by CIA

to the Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest

in the past in these matters, we cannot rule out the possibility

the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired

coverage at some time in the future.

(B) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES -- The Bureau recently completed discussions with the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarding that agency's operational activities in

the United States.

These discussions essentially decit with ClA's asses-aunt

and recruitment of foreign intelligenre sources in the United States. Enclosed

for your use is a list of the ground rules which both agencies have accopted

as guidelines for effecting the necessary coordination. In urder that you may

be adequately oriented in this matter, the following background is set lorth.

The need for the ground rules is related to Cli's interesi in dereloping

positive intelligence sources in the Unitsc States and the necessity for

protecting the Bureau's jurisdiction in the counterintelligence field, The

latter is essential to the adequate discharge of our responsibilities to

national security.

Positive intelligence may be described is a comprchensive product

resulting from collection, evaluation, colation, analysis, and interpretation

of all available information relating to national security and concerning other

countries where such information is significant to our Co: erninent's revelma-

ment

and execution of plans: policies, and courses of action.

Such intelligence

can be divided into various categories, such as economic, military, scientific.

political, geographic, et cerera.

The rotection of positive intelligeno: is

distinguished from counterintelligence waich is primarily dcsigned to penetrate.

monitor, neutralize and/or disrupt the foreign intoiligence ond security services.

Counterintelligence further incluces other functions of an internal security

nature directed againsi subrersive groups, cigunzarions, and individuals. Sy

law CIA does not have any law enforcement or internal security funcuons. CIA's

authorization for collecting positive intelligence is predicated on the Nationai

Security Act of 1947 and subsequent issuance oi National Socurity Council

Directives. There is no law, directive, or chartor which euthorizes Cia in

engage in the clandestine development of positive intelligence sources in the

United States. Therefore, in the absence of any statutory prerogative lo conduc

such activity in the United States, it nes been mutually agreed by FBI and Ci

that the Agency can only engage in the clandestine developrent and harling ei

positive intelligence sources in this country by coordinatin: with the Bereat.

The Bureau in turn legally has the primary counterintelligence responstanti::

in the U. S. and is continually developing postave intelligence, It, horarer.

must be regarded an incidental product io our reain dojective.

The Buren

does not have a primary responsibility to collect positive intelligence: but we

do have numerous and very signisicant obligations in this field. In actual practice

the Bureau is required by the President and other agencies to develop inferriano.

of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to

bring about the necessary coverage. A good example is our involvement

in the development of information relating to the crisis in the Dominican

Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be "gray areas"

of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to

effect adequate coordinating machinery.

The potential for the development of positive intelligence in this

country is vast and varied. Voluminous positive intelligence is collected

overtly through the review of foreign and domestic publications, interviews

of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this

area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive

intelligence both agencies have an interest, and there is a necessity for a

clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is

this true in the development of positive intelligence sources who are

employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States

or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many years the Bureau has had a continuing progräm of

developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of discharging

our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for developing

positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in

formulating policy.

The Bureau, recognizing CIA s need for sources in the

positive intelligence field, has permitted CIA to assess and recruit sources in

the United States in a limited manner with the understanding that such activities

are fully coordinated with the Bureau. In January, 1964, CIA established

their Domestic Operations Division (DOD) to conduct such operations in the

United States. and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished

the necessary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with CIA

resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established

in January, 1964.

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA

as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be decided at the

Seat of Government, As a general rule. Bureau Headquarters will be informed

by ClA regarding its interest in an individual or a target. Prior to notification

of CIA regarding our position, the situation will be carefully reviewed at the

Seat of Government. This may often include a request to the field for

observations and recommendaBens before notice is transmitted to CIA. A:

the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a

representative of bob, CiA. li so, you should be guided by the enclosed

ground rules in any discussions, bearing in mind that the approval for any

particular operational activity is lo be made at Bureau Headquarters.

You should hoid to the concept that the protection of the internal

security of the United States involves very basic clear-cut responsibilities

of the FBI. This should be kept in mind in each case and in any contacts

which you may have with CIA representatives.

There is to be no interfere-se

with or infringement upon our jurisdiction. It is recognized that unforest.

developments may create situations not adequately covered by the ground riles.

You, therefore, should report such matters to the Bureau setting forth

complete details with your recommendations. Although we have been informed

by CIA that the Bureau's jurisdiction and operational interests will not be

interfered with, we cannot discount the results of past experiences stemming

from CIA's operational and organizational deficiencies. We have no reasc= io

believe that there will be a revolutionary change of these conditions. It is.

therefore, incumbent upon you to be extremely alert for any breakdown of :-a

adherence to the ground rules. I emphasize that this is an area of activity

which must be closely monitored by each Special Agent in Charge. You

should be certain that your personnel is adequately oriented so that the Bureau

can have the full benefit of any constructive suggestions pertaining to this

entire matter.

07_1-11-01

Item Number 38 In the material subnitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in hismmorandum of 3/5/70 serves as

a sort of summary in which SA Papich indicates that he cannot

recall the names of other cases which resulted in CIA displeasure

or criticism, but does cite one instance "early in the 1950'g"

in which we disseninated data from a source of unknown rellability.

charging Allen Dulles as having been a communist and a spy

while in furope.

By letter 3/22/52, we Informed State and CIA that a

source of unknown reliability had alleged that the brother of

John Foster Dulles had been arrested in Hungary in 1947 or

1948 and forced to write a letter to his wife which brought her

to hungary where she was also arrested. We asked for an

evaluation of the information.

Mr. D. M. Ladd menorandun,

4/5/52, states he received a call from Allen Dulles during which

Dulles referred to the letter and said he was not concerned

about it but wanted ladd to look it over. We were subsequently

informed by CIA that Allen Dulles (the only brother of

John foster Dulles and then CIA Deputy Director) had said that

the information concerning Dulles and his wife was without

loundation and we promptly told State of this by letter 4/15/52,

a copy of which was directed to Allen Dulles. Mr. Keay's

memorandum 5/10/52 written by SA Papich reports his discussion

with dulles concerning this matter:

Mr. Dulles asked if the

original letter could be withdrawn and was told that it appeared

that the FBI had already set the records straight but that if he

wished to make an official request, Papich woulf refer the matter

Dulles. Inmediately replied that

he definitely did not want to nake "a big thing" of the letter,

that it was not that important, and that maybe it would be better

to drop the natter.. General Smith (then Director of Central

Intelligence) later told Papich that he considered the matter

closed.

SA Papich also alludes to other instances in which

cle alleged that we had mishandled its information. it has no

i specifics, however, and states he cannot recall the cases.

effectively realize positive results with a minimum of

duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of the CIA to consider coordina-

tion of our mutual efforts in the collection of positive

intelligence in the United States. As a result of these

conferences, a set of ground rules was drawn up and agreed

to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted

In wy letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director

Vice Admiral William F. Raborn, JI. A copy of the agreement

is enclosed for your information.

This agreement has proven

generally effective and no major problems have been

encountered since its adoption in the areas it covers.

to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.

Intelligence agencies, including the CIA, and policy-making

Sincerely yours,
