OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

This report will cover the period 30 July 1965 through

15 September 1963 and is a follow-up report to reference 1.

EFFORTS TO LEGALLY EXFILTRATE ANLEO-3 FAMILY FIR CUBA

Since transmission of reference A to Headquarters several

developments occurred which effectively

eliminated several alternate

solutions to the problem of the AMLEO? family in Cuba.

alternate solutions that were eliminated, as found in paragraph

§ of reference A, were (a) "Maintain Status Quo as a Family

attempting Leave

Cuba via Offices of Swiss Embassy as Part of the

American Repatriation Progran'; (b) "Have AMLEO-3 Family

Withdraw Papers From the Swiss

Embassy and American Repatriation

Program and Attempt Leave Cuba as Normal Refugees via Mexico

Or Spain"; and (e) "Have

GOC Through the 'Donovan' Channel for Possible Legal Exfiltration".

Elimination of the above alternates left only two solutions

that vere at all feasible; (c) "Have tho AMLO-3 Family Take

Asylum In either the Uruguayan or Mexican Embassies in Havana"

or (d) "Have the AMLEO-3 Fanily Exfiltrated black in a Maritime

Operation by either a KUBARK or Independent Maritime Tean."

Because of the inherent risk involved in a black exfiltration,

It was decided that the ALLO-S family should be put into

asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexican embassies with all

possible speed.

To this end steps more initlated in on 24 July 1963

to put

the AMLEO-3 faully and AMLEO-? into asylum in the Mexican

Embassy in Havana.

The AMLEQ-3 fanily and AMLEO-? were advised

via the AMVEE-l OWVl channel on 4 August 1963 to prepare

themselves for asylum and to await further orders via the same

channel.

KUBARK Station in Mexico City, meanwhile, took urgent

action through 1ts Mexican liaison channels to have the Mexican

Foreign Ministry obtain visas for the AMLEO-3 fanily and

AMLED-2; and then send word to the Mexican Embassy in Havana,

Cuba that the AMLEO-3 funtly and AMLEO-2 should be granted asylum

when they appeared at the Mexican Consulate under cover of

obtaining thelr visas.

The visa portion of the operation was

satisfactorily completed and notification of same was sent into

the Mexican Embassy in Havana; but word re asylum for the

AMLEO3 family and AVLEO-2 was not sent to the Mexican embassy

due to insecure conmo channels and lack of trusted

couriers,

and

to date no secure method has yet been found to

notify the Mexican

Embassy in Havana that asylum should be granted to the Alleos.

As a result of the above, word was sent to AMVEE-1

via OWVI on 11 September requesting he detemine whether or not

Identity A would bo willing to act as intermediary to receive

the AMLLO-3 family and AMLEQ-2 into asylun at a specific tine

and date at the Mexican consulate.

AMWEE-1 asked for

clarification on the manner of approaching Identity A on the case

on 13 September via pouch, and more detailed guidance on the

matter was sent to him via CWl on 14 Septenber. A final reply

re possibllities for action via this channel 1s

oxpected from

AMWEL-1 momentarily.

If the AMWEE-1 reply is lavorable, then

he will be told to arrange the meeting at the Mexican consulate

between the AlLEOs and Identity A so that they can be taken into

asylum by the Mexicans.

As noted in reference B, if the AMWEE-1 report is a

negative one, then consideration

will be given

to having the

AMLEOs take asylun in the Uruguayan Embasgy In Havana.

As noted in paragraph 1 of reference B,

the wife

of AMLEO-3 finally made a direct contact with ANTHUG-1 on 7

September 1963, while he was at his Santa Maria beach house,

and appoaled too him for permission to leave Cuba with her

children and rejoin her husband AMLi0-3 in the United States.

[On 14 September 1963 AMLEO-J received a letter from his wife

giving more details on the above meeting.

The

wife of AMLEO-3

had been visiting the beach home of a family friend, situated

next to that of AlTUG-1 on Santa Maria beach, on a dally basis

hoping to see ANTHUG-1.

Finally, on 7 September 1963, she saw

him swimming alone in the ocean

and promptly

went into the water,

Introduced herself, and requested ramission to

talk to him.

ANTHUG-1 granted this permission, and during their conversation

ANTHUG-1 made it clear he would not grant Mrs. AMLEO-3 pernission

to depart Cuba at this time, stating that the time was not

propitious due to the attacks and raids being carried out

against Cuba, and that Mrs. AMLEO-3 would just have to wait.

Mrs. AMLEO-3

then told him she did not see why he was holding her

and her children responsible for what her husband did; that she

feared her husband night forget her and their children completely

11 the separation continued,

and that if AMLFO-3 was left much

longer alone he mould jind a woman to replace her.

AAITHUG - 1

replied by asking her "Do you consider yourself a burden to your

husband?"

The wife replied "It is possible", and

AMTHUG-] then

asked "But he calls you every day."

Later during the conversation AMTHUG-1 asked

AMLEO-3 1f her husband still had the presentation Soviet

pistol that he. had given him in 1961, and Mrs. AMLE0-3

informed him that her husband had taken it with him when he

defected and asked ANTHUG-1 if he wanted it returned: to him.

ANTHUG-1 did not reply to the question.

Later on, wille

discussing her conversation with ANTHUG-l with Identity B,

Identity B suggested to Ars. AMLEO-3 that she request ANLEQ-3

to send the pistol back to AMTHUG-1 via Ambassador LECHUGA

at the United Nations, NYC. Identity B added that the return

of the pistol might help matters since the loss of the pistol had

been one of the things that bothered ANTHUG-l most when

AMLEO3 defected.

(i.e, AHLEO-3 has noted that these special

presentation Soviet pistols were given by AlTHUG-l to probably

less than ten people in Cuba, and their presentation had a very

special meaning for ANTHUG-I

since the recipients were supposed

to be his very personal and close friends.

AMLEO-3 claims

that not even AlLOUT-l had received one of these special

presentation pistols from AUTHUG-1.) Consideration is being

given to ANTHUG-l's request, if it would assist hrs. AMLEO-3

1n her efforts to leave Cuba, but for the time being the pistol

will be held by KUBARK.

8.

ANTAUG-1 also told Nrs. AMLEO-3 that her husband had

stolen

a light plane when he fled and implled (although she

does not so state directly) that he would like to see it

returned.

The balance of Mrs. AMLIO-3'g letter concerned her

desire to leave Cuba, mentioned the necessity for almess by both

she and her husband with no rash actions, and without giving

any additional facts stated that her conversation with ANTHUG-1

had been a long one but that she could not get him to make

any prOmises re her departure.

DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATIONAL LEADS TO DISKFFECTED CUBANS

During the operational period one of AMLIO-3's

operational leads, whom he had written a report on for the

ANTRUNK PM operation:, was recruited via the recently successful

ANTRUNK infiltration

operation and given the crypt of AMTRUNK-10.

AMIED 3 also screened additional ANTRUNK leads and KUTUBE

military leads during the period and was able to submit

reports on some four individuals for these operations.

All such

leads were fed to him mixed in with many other Cuban names.

AMLEO-3 is presently preparing reports on PHS target studies

Major Felipe GUERRA Matos and Major Jorge SEGUERA, Cuban

Ambassador to Algeria.

AMLEO-3 also

assisted is the handling of AMLEO-5'g

wife during

the period when she established direct telephonic

communication with her husband in Cuba,

and tried to convince

him that she wanted to return to Cuba with her children,

but stipulated to A-5 that he

would have to meet her in a third

country first and resolve their personal fanily

problems.

ALILEO-3 baby sat for the wife during these calls, since we

only knew what day the calls would be coming in and never the

He also assisted Hrs. AMIE0-5 in recording the last telephr

conversation she had with her husband.

In this same operation

AMLEO-3 also assisted the Case Officer in the conversations

held with the nother of AMLED while sho was in the United

States, although he was never allowed to establish direct

contact with the nother.

We had hoped that the mother of

AULEO-5 would attempt to estabilsh contact on her own with

AMLEO-3, but to WAVE Station knowledge

she never attenpted to do

she had, we would have allowed AMLEQ] to respond to her

contact efforts (maintaining his cover as being disassociated

with ODYOKE).

early September

1963 Raul PRIMELLES (201-J27902) arrived at Identity B's

home for a visit while Mrs. AMLEO-3 was present.

Mr. and Mrs.

PRIMALLES Ignored the presence of Mrs. A-3 and did not speak

to herewbile greeting Identity B.

Because of this Identity B

promptly turned her back on her visitors and did not anawer

them, continuing her conversation with Mrs. AMLEO-3.

Mr. and

Mrs. PRIMELLES were thrown into some confusion by

this reception

departed from the area.

Mrs. AMLEO-S has also mentioned that UNSNAFU-12

was most kind

to her during her recent home leave in Cuba,

and made it quite clear she was anzious to get in touch with

AMLEO- 3.

During the latter part of August Mrs. A-3 again

mentioned to her husband that UNSNAFU-12 had written Identity

B from Earls stating she was surprised at not having heard

IrOM AULEO-3.

ATTITUDE, MORALE, AND PERPORMANCE OF AMLEO-3

During the reporting period AMLEO-3 has consistently

cooperative with his C/O and has maintained a good attitude

towards his work.

During the latter part of Aigust 1963 AMLEQ-3

began to lose his patience with the slow progress in getting

b1s wife into asylum, and began requesting permission to return

to Cuba hinself in order to exfiltrate his wife black.

AMLEO - 3

became quite demanding in this regard and clained that KUBARK's

time had run out, and since he had waited patiently for nine

months he now felt it was his turn to try his luck.

is extremely confident of his own ability in action situations

and operations and extensive argumentation was needed to

persuade him that such a course of action would be suicidal

for his wife and children and that his wisest course of action

would be to give us additional time to bring the asylum operation

to a successful conclusion.

Because of AMLEO-3'g faith in

higher authority,

COS JAWAVE, Andrew K. REUTIMAN visited AMLEO-3

on 8 September 1963 for the purpose of convincing him that any

unilateral action on his part would only be counterproductive

and playing right into ANTHUG-I's hands.

KUBARK's limited

conmitments to AMLEO-3 were also reviewed along with the history

of our actions to help his wife and children leave Cuba legally.

After some frank exchanges of facts AMLEO-3 was finally convinced

that the only productive course of action left to him wag to

continue to sweat out the asylum proposition and hope for the

Absolutely no further commitments were made to AbLEO-3

during these discussions and alternate courses of action if

the asylum attempts fall were not discussed but instead left in

abeyance.

OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND PLANNING

14. As previously mentioned in paragrapla 13 of reference A,

AMLRO 3 went to ZRMITAl during the period 26-30 July 1963 for

the purpose of obtaining a French visa for his allas

documentation.

AMLEO-3 successfully obtained the French visa

during this trip, and his allas passport now contains valid visas

for travel to Spain and France.

WAVE Station regrets that reference C has not been

answered to date.

In reply we can only state that AMLEO-3

was thoroughly briefed on the limitations of his allas documentation

when said documentation was issued to hin.

He was told that the

credit card documents could never be used for identification or

credit purposes.

He had also been warned to avold situations

where he would be asked for positive identification,

such as

renting a car, and by attempting to procure a rental

car in

ZRIETAL he was acting contrary to instructions given to him

by his WAVE C/O. On AlLEO-3's return to WAVI he was castigated for

his actions, and again briefed on the limitations of his alias

documentation.

In order to strengthen his allas documentation

an I.D. card document identifying him as an employeeeof "Charles

S. Wilson Associates" has been issued to him, as suggested by

(Chester D. DAINOLD 1a conversations with AMLFO-3 1n ZRMETAL.

In regard to points a and b in paragraph 2 of reference C,

the KURIOT representative in lave Station states that the Florida

drivers license

issued to Joseph A. Reese is a valid, backstopped

drivers license for actual use by the Subject and the address

cover story was that he recently noved to the Miani area from

New Orleans, Louisiana (which city the Subject lived i for

several years and bas relatives residing there). The Subjet's

documentation is therefore correct for his cover story.

The

spelling of "instalment" on the National Credit Card was correctly

copied from the

original document reproduced by KURIOT and we must

point out that "instalment" is not only correct according to the

dictionaries but is the spelling of the word which is now frequently

preferred.

(The Wall Street Journal invariably prints the word

as "Instalment" with one "I".) It would be appreciated Il

Headquarterg would in the future coordinate with KURIOT 1D

Headquarters on questions which deal with AQUATIC matters prior-to

querying WAVE.

COSTS

16.

AMLEO-3 continues to receive a flat salary of five

hundred dollars ($500.00) per month, and also is paid approximately

one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for purchase of foodstuffs

since he is encouraged to eat his meals in the KUBARK

safehouse and stay out of public places.

to pay the wife of AMLEO-S the amount of one hundred and twenty

five

dollars ($125.00) per month for subsistance for herself and her

two children to supplement the $120.00 per month she receives

from the Cuban Refugee Center.

to find part-time employment for Mrs. AMLEO-5 so

could be relieved of the necessity to support her, but to date

we have been unsuccessful in our efforts primarily because Mrs.

AMLEO-5 has never worked in her llfe and has no work skills

whatgoever.

No other financial expenditures of note vere made

during the

period, and no financial assistance is presently

contemplated for any other AMLEOs.

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

17. During the reporting period no positive intelligence

reports

were disseminated by the AULEO group since none of the

active agents are locater in the target area, nor do they

circulate in Cuban exile circles.
