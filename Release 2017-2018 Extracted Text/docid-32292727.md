MARCY:

PORCARO:

This guy is freezing all your jobs?

Yeah, the dirty (obs). And the guys I have made

in my time.

I made........ for Recorder, I

put HODGE for Auditor,

MARCY:

PORCARO:

He's gonna make it this month I see.

Yeah.

Now, look what's happening.

I lost my clout,

•I°m

out now, but I said don't try to pressure

me just because I'm out now. The world changes,

what's true today may not be true tomorrow.

has a way of catching up to these guys. I

always friendly to JOHN and tried to do

see JOHN go to jail than do him a favor. But

if he won?t do what they tell him, watch out.

MARCY:

PORCARO:

I think you're right.

I'm positive.

And that (obs) has got everybody

on the payroll. His brother-in-law came dron

out of town and never worked a precinct. He's

on for $14,000 a year.

But look, try to straighten

this out for me, I don't care how much I get, just

so I get it every two weeks.

500 a month.

You work it out with him, will you?

MARCY:

OK, JOE.

It is noted that TONY, GIROLAMI referred to above

is the Democratic Ward Committeeman of the 28th Ward, being

the counterpart of PORCARO in this respect. The above

conversation brings into focus information furnished by

who is identical toCG 6498-PC. He has advised

the Arent handling him that due to the influence of the

FBI over him in recent

years he has attempted to slowly but

surely cut the ties of the hoodlums and their associates,

such as D'ARCO and MARCY, with him.. He advised that he is

concerned with his actions in this

regard due to the fact

that he lives "among them" in a predominantly Italian

neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago and must leave

his wife and child alone frequently at night. He stated that

he has received no direct threats but has been approached by

GI ROLAMI.

has cited several instances where he has

been in recent contact with hoodlums, such as GIANCANA

and HUMPHREls, and has refused to do their bidding. One of

these recent instances was in November, 1962, when he

refused to support PORCARO for the vacancy which existed

when he left the Aldermanship of the 28th Ward and became

Clerk of the Probate Court.

The reference to GIROLAMI'S

brother-in-law from

out of town is a reference to the

brother of GIROLANI's wife, JACK KUBIAK, who is originally

from Niles, Michigan, whom GIROLAMI recently placed on the

payroll of

the Illinois Toll Road Commission.

MARCY then telephonically contacted SID KORSHAK

and informed him that he would see him in KORSHAK's office.

MARCY then contacted Sergeant PAUL QUINN, Secretary

of Police Commissioner ORLANDO W. WILSON, and attempted

to place a school crossing guard on the South Side of Chicago.

QUINN apparently informed MARCY that he should contact MATT

DANAHER, Administrative Aid of Mayor DALEY, which MARCY then did.

advised that

he would instruct the Mayor's Office

to comply with MARCY's wishes and MARCY then recontacted

Sergeant QUINN to so advise him.

MARCY then carried on the following conversation with

Alderman BENJAMIN LEWIS, Negro Alderman from the 24th Ward

of Chicago:

MARCY:

Hi, Alderman.

What did you do with that guy's

wife.

Your (obs) right, he's got the arm going

for him. Let me tell you something. You might

want the arm going for you sometime and it'll

be there for you too.

Yeah.

OK. All right.

OK. Yeah, but you don't do that to good friends,

You know what I mean.

that's right, that's right. Listen, you're

my friend, I don't want to argue with you. All

right.

MARCY then asked FRED ROTI to obtain the private

number of FRANK CHESROW which he dialed after receiving it.

He talked to CHESROW as follows:
