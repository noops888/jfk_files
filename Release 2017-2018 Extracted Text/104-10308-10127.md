AMFAUNA-26 Progress Report for October, November and December 1963

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES

Action Required: For Your Information

Reference: UFGA-11700, dated 14 October 1963

Operational Developments:

Seven SW messages were received from AMFAUNA-26 during the

period, and two were

sent to her.

Two SW messages written by

• AMFAUNA-2!

and no. 36, have not been received and it is not known what has

happened to them.

It. has been observed that mail to and from Cienfuego:

is very slow and uncertain; SW message no. 10 sent to AMFAUNA-26 on 6

November did not reach her until 22 December.

continuing effort was made during the period to activate

AMFAUNA-26's OWVL and medium speed radio systems.

OWVL transmissions

were begun on 16 October with message no. 1 warning AMFAUNA-26 of the

arrest of AMFAUNA-14 the week before (see AMFAUNA-1 Progress Report for

October, November and December 1963) and the fact that AMCUTLER-2 was

calibrated in meters instead of kilocycles and she had been unable to

find the correct frequency.

JMWAVE then sent AMFAUNA-26 instructions

for converting kilocycles to meters, and began transmitting dummy

messages, giving AMFAUNA-26 a simple code for reporting by commercial

telegram whether she was receiving them, and whether and with what books

she was able to decipher.

Two sets of deciphering materials had been sent to AMFAUNA-26.

One package was buried by AMGLEN-9 in Pinar del Rio Province (see WAVE

5887 of 16 October 1963),

and AMFAUNA-26 was informed of its location

in OWL message no. 1 of

16 October and SW message no. 10 of 6 November.

A previous set of number groups had been sent to her by SW early in

October. It now appears that AMFAUNA-26 never redeld

either of these

sets of group$•

As of, 22 November when AMFAUNA26's sIster.Olga arrived

in Mexico (see paragraph 5), AMFAUNA-26 already had in her possession ?

the letter containing the groups written in SW, but either had tried and

failed to develop it, or had hesitated to try to do so, not knowing in

what strength to use the reagent and erroneously thinking that this was

a critical factor.

As mentioned previously, AMFAUNA-26 did not receive

SW message no.

10 until 22 December; on the. following day she sent an

open telegram to the son of AMFAUNA-32 in Miami, confirming her willing-

ness to travel to Pinar del Rio and recover the

material.

It is not

known whether she actually did so.

It had been planned, once AMFAUNA-26 was receiving OWL and

her ability to recover caches

confirmed, to have (AMWEE-1) cache AMFAUNA-1'€

radio and to inform AMFAUNA-26 of its location by OWL.

Events did not

permit this.

AMFLORA-1 sent. a telegram to his JMWAVE area accommodation

on 16 November 1963, reporting that his wife, the sister of

AMFAUNA-26, was due to arrive in Mexico City on 20 November.

City Station was so informed on 18 November (see WAVE-7762), but by the

time confirmation arrived (MEXI-7031'of 23 November)

the lady had

already departed for Caracas.

The oral messages which she brought from

AMFAUNA-26 therefore did not

reach JMWAVE until 20 December when HVCA-

10780 was received.

This dispatch transmitted a typewritten note from

AMFLORA-l's wife containing the following information:

AMFAUNA-26 had run out of developer pills.

(In retrospect:

this does not seem

because AMFAUNA26 was evidently able to

develop SW message no. 10 which she received on 22 December (see paragrarl:

What AMFAUNA-26 had probably been trying to convey was that she

was running very

short of pills.

AMFAUNA-1- does not

remember how many

he gave her, but the most probable number appears to be twelve.)

b. AMFAUNA-26 had been unable to develop the SW message

containing her cipher groups, because she had not been told how to mix

her reagent.

AMCUTLER-2 was very worried by the fact that AMFAUNA-14

had been telephoning her frequently, and was afraid that AMFAUNA-14 was

betraying her to the DSE.

AMFAUNA-26 was uneasy about being left in Cuba without a

responsible leader to report to.

AMFAUNA-26's cover was wearing very thin, due to indis-

cretions by -AMFAUNA-31.

In her SW message no. 29, which was received at JMWAVE on 21

October, AMFAUNA-26 reported that AMFAUNA-38 had been arrested

September

and taken to Santa Clara.

At 0200 hours

on the following

morning,

fourteen policemen came to AMFAUNA-26's house and searched

on the pretext of looking for a burglar.

However, the only part of the

house which they searched was the part inhabited by AMFAUNA-26.

In her SW message no. 30, AMFAUNA-26 reported

the full names

óf two individuals who had approached her sub-agents AMFAUNA-29 and

While neither JMWAVE nor Headquarters (DIR-78835 of 30 October 1963)

had any traces on these persons,

JMWAVE has a carded reference to a

sensitive source document which

carries the full name of Amable SANCHEZ

Borroto and the implication that he enjoys the confidence of the Cuban

Government.

Unfortunately,

an error was made in typing the card, and

the document is unrecoverable.

•On 12 October 1963, AMFAUNA-26 was in Havant

ANCUTLER-2: About 23 or 24 October she was again in herland again

saw AMCUTLER-2.

On both occasions the problems posed by the arrest'of;!

AMFAUNA-14 were the prime topic of discussion.

In outgoing SW message no. 9 of 30 September, AMFAUNA-26 ha

oeen asked to investigate a Cuban naval officer named Carlos *LOPEZ

Avalos with a view to forming an opinion as to his political attitude.

She reported in SW message no. 37 of 3 November that all reports on

this individual were derogatory except for one given by AMLAME-5. This

report reached AMFAUNA-26 via AMFAUNA-31 who got it

from a man identified

only as Ramon "PEREZ who said that AMLAME-5 had told him that he had a

the Swiss Embassy, and that LOPEZ was already connected with

eople outside of Cuba and had recently performed a great service IO

the counterrevolution.

at cuba

When the arrest ANcUrtEn became known to JuvAvE see

AMFAUNA-1 Progress Report for October,

November and December 1963), the

son of AMFAUNA-32 was asked to phone his mother in Cienfuegos and instruc

her to tell AMFAUNA-26 to go into hiding.

On 3 January the son reported

completion of the call and said that his mother had told him that

AMFAUNA-26 had been arrested on 29 December and taken to the Santa Clara

The reason for 'AMFAUNA-26's arrest remains obscure, or rather

there are so many acceptable explanations that the problem is to select

the right one.

seem to be suggested by the fact that her house was searched

She could have been implicated by AMFAUNA-38, as viately

following AMFAUNA-38's arrest; if so, however, it is hard to explain

why AMFAUNA-26 herself was not arrested until

three and one-half months

She could have been denounced by ANCUTLER-2 who was herself

arrested two or three days before AMFAUNA-26's arrest; this seems unlikel,

in view of the fact that AMCUTLER-2 and AMFAUNA-26 are friends,

AMCUTLER-2 reaches the point where she is ready to implicate other

members of the AMFAUNA net she could be expected to begin with people

who are not her friends,

and that at least one such person (AMFAUNA-25)

was known to be at liberty

as recently as 4 January 196%, as were two of

the cutouts between AMFAUNA-26 and AMCUTLER-2 (AMPAUNA32 and AMFAUNA-33);

AMCUTLER-2 is believed to have been under surveillance by the DSE, at

least sporadically,

between 12 and 24 October (see AMFAUNA-1 Progress

Report for October, November, and December 1963), and AlFAUNA-26 could

have been observed

and identified when she visited AMCUTLER-2 during

this period and marked for

subsequent arrest and interrogation in

connection with AMCUTLER-2's activities.

AMFAUNA-26 could have made an

attempt between 22 and 29 December to recover the cached cipher groups

(see paragraph 3), and either been detected in the act or arrested while

trying to contact AMCUTLER-2 on the same trip; in this case, however,

it would seem that the DSE would not have transported her all the way

back to Santa Clara 'but would have kept her in Harana for concurrent

interrogation with AMCUTLER-2.

The open telegram sent to the son of

AMFAUNA-32 on 23 December was

rather indiscreet and could have caused

difficulties for the sender,

but some of these difficulties ought in this

case to have brushed off on AMFAUNA-32 herself, and as of 3 January 1964

she was still at liberty.

One of these persons

AMFAUNA-26 nor AMLAME-5 had been involved in any plot against the life

of Fidel CASTRO, but both could have been high on a general suspect list.

The only known factor common to both AMLANE-5 and AMFAUNA-26 is the

Ramon *PEREZ mentioned in paragraph 9. AMLAME-5 evidently was extra-

ordinarily indiscreet when he talked with this man.

ATTFAUNA-31 has also

spoken with him and according to the oral message brought out by

AMFAUNA-26's sister (see paragraph 5-e) AMFAUNA-3] has been habitually

indiscreet.:

and AMFAUNA-26.

Ramon PEREZ was thus in a position to denounce both AMLANE-5,

If so, AMEAUNA-31 also ought to have been implicated,

and it is perhaps significatn in this connection that, of all of
