followed effectively through the use of this source. This

source should also prove to be a valuable addition to current

coverage of mob activity in Brooklyn.

During this period since 8/15/58,

NY 211-C furnished

extensive information concerning ANTHONI SALERNO, wa. "Fat Tony"

which, when coupled with information previously furnished by

this informant and other available information, resulted in a vu

new case being opened on SALERNO.

It is noted that SALERNO is reputed to be MIKE,

COPPOLA'S representative in East Harlem, NYC, and among other

activity, bosses the biggest numbers operation in the NY

metropolitan area.

Concerning coverage of logical meeting places for

hoodlums in NYC, a new PCI case has been opened on the manager

of the Chateau Gardens, a lower East Side catering hall known

to be used regularly by hoodlums for such gatherings as wedding

receptions and christenings which have in the past been shown

to be a convenient way

for hoodlums to meet. The NYO has re-

ceived this individual's full cooperation in obtaining discreet

coverage of one gathering to date in which this office

had an

interest, and this PCI has indicated he will alert the NYO to

future gatherings believed to be of interest to the Bureau.

NY 2412-C, a hoodlum recently qualified as a new

CI, has for many years operated various rackets in Brooklyn

such as bookmaking, numbers, shylocking, and was a well-known

receiver of stolen merchandise on a large scale.

This in

formant knows and has associated with many of the major

hoodlums in Brooklyn, NY, and his recent development as a

criminal informant should prove extremely valuable both to

ind one

the Top Hoodlum Program and in hijacking and other criminal

activity in which the NYO has an interest.

Because of

excellent underworld connections and respect built up over

the years as boss of his own operation, this informant is

in the desired strata in the NYC underworld which should enable

him to develop information on the upper levels necessary in

this program.

Another source currently being converted to a CI

has furnished extensive information concerning the West Side

NYC mob previously run by NO top hoodlum JOHN MICHAEL BARLE,

who was murdered in NYC in June, 1958.

This source is regularly

furnishing current information on the activities of the remants

of this mob and concerning the attempt by a member, EDDIE CROW,

to take over the mob and sustain its operation. Of particular M.Y

importance with respect to the placement of this source is the

tendency of members of the EARLE mob to participate in crimes

within the Bureau's jurisdiction, it being noted that 6 members

of this group are currently serving lengthy prison sentences in

Atlanta Penitentiary, most of which were imposed in NYO bank

robbery cases. This source has also been used recently by this

mob to pass messages between the mob in NYC and the above-

mentioned members in the Atlanta Penitentiary.

NY 31-C has furnished information regarding NYO top.

hoodlum CARMINEXGALANTE'S meeting two NYC judges, identified by Itali

informant as HELLÉR and DI FALCO, in Paris, France, during 195%

and defraying their expenses on that occasion.

It has been determined that NYC Judges SAMUEL

DI FALCO

and LOUISELLER were registered at a Paris hotel at the same Frant

time during Aug, 1957, and it was also determined that GALANTE

and JOSEPH BONANNO, Phoenix top hoodlum, formerly from Brooklyn,.

were in Paris together during Oct., 1957• GALANTE and BONANNO A21184he

were subsequently in Italy in Nov, 1957, just prior to the frame

Apalachin meeting, 11/14/57, which BONANNO was known to have™.

attended Frequent reports have also been received that

GALANTE was present at this meeting although his presence

went undetected.

With relation to the July, 1958, murder of CHRISTOFORO

RUBINO, a hoodlum reportedly closely connected with LUCKY

LUCIANO, and at the time of his murder under indictment in

a Federal narcotics conspiracy case in the EDNY, information

was received from NY 169-C regarding an allegation made by

two Brooklyn hoodlums that members of the Brooklyn underworld

had received information from a "DA" in connection with the

narcotics case in which RUBINO was named as a defendant.

During subsequent contacts by this informant with these

hoodlums, information was developed that the "DA" was named

SOVIERO.

This informant also learned that members of the

underworld had suspected that a few racket people might. be

ready to do some talking and that the killing of RUBINO was

also to serve as a lesson to others who might have a tendency

to inform.

It is noted that immediately following RUBINO'S

murder, AUSA JOSEPH SOVIERO, JR., EDNY, issued a press release

to the effect that RUBINO was scheduled to appear before a N.Y,

Federal Grand Jury in Brooklyn within a week from the time he

was murdered and was expected to be a cooperative witness

regarding the operation of the narcotics ring in question.

NY 169-C later advised during Sept., 1958, that a

source told informant that SOVIERO "got some heat from someone

in the Government'' and had left the USA'S office for fear of

trouble and questioning: Informant was also told at this time

that SOVIERO was going to work for the State of NY as an

attorney. In the course of informant's conversation with his

hoodlum sources, informant was told that SOVIERO had been

given

a quiet dinner a short time before in Manhattan, NY, at

which time SOVIERO was given $15,000. The informant was told

that the money paid SOVIERO had been furnished directly by

VITO GENOVESE. N.K,

It was subsequently determined that JOSEPH SOVIERO

had resigned from the USA'S Office, EDNY, on 9/12/58 and took

employment in the office of NY State Attorney General LOUIS J.

LEFKOWITZ.

With respect to information concerning locations

frequented by NYC hoodlums, information has been received

from NY 2151-& concerning a closed, member, Brooklyn sociat

ly being frequented by Nx hoodlums of importance,

such

as JOHN ODDO, wa..

"Johnny Bathbeach", JOE/SCHIPANI, and

other hoodlum associates.

Informant regularly frequents this

club, and it is contemplated informant will be of assistance

in the event the club lends itself to investigation by con-

fidential installations.

In further attempts to obtain maximum coverage,

certain closed informant files have been reviewed on

, a select

basis and a number of these files have been reopened for use

as sources in the top hoodlum program. This review determined

that a certain percentage of these closed sources had furnished

significant information concerning mob activity and GIIF in-

formation but had not furnished sufficient information in

Bureau cases to sustain their status. These sources are being

recontacted to determine their current value in this program.

Also included in this particular category is former NY 956-C,

who was released from a NY State prison during early Nov.,

1958. This informant has previously furnished information

concerning mob activity, and arrangements are being made to

recontact him to determine if he will be in a position to

furnish information of interest in this program.

The NYO also plans to use former San Juan 414-C

who recently moved to NYC for the purpose of participating

in the operation of a numbers bank. Initial contact has

been made with this informant and a

letter assigning him a

NY symbol number is being prepared.

Accomplishment (Dissemination)

In addition to a number of matters which have

been disseminated to other agencies, which will not be dis-

cussed in detail here, is the following situation which is

felt sufficiently noteworthy to be discussed briefly as
