a mysterious Cuban named "X" who had had some involvement

with the CId and with the kennedy assassination.

know how this intormation had gotten to JACK ANDERSON.

ZABALA said that it appeared that his meeting with CARBONELL

was accidental bit he believed that the Cubans were adept

in planning meetings and he assumed that inasmuch as his

sister had

left

che airport. to go to the Cuban Embassy,

that she had told CARBONELL that he (ZABALA) would be in

the airport area waiting to return to san Juan.

At this time ZABALA said that he also recalled

At this time she

which ZABALA stated he had done. ZABALA said that

she

met with Rix the day before she

as an Archetictural Engineer with his office being in a new .

building constructed

on Ponce de leon Avenue in san Juan

as Radio Havana was continually monitored in Miami, these

facts would soon be known among the Cuban community. ZABALA
