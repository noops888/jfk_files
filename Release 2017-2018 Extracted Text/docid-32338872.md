II. EVIDENCE OF LAWSON'S COWMUNIST PARTY MEMBERSHIP

SECRET

A: Direct Evidence of Membership

Testifying before the Joint Fact-Finding Comnittee, California

Legislature, in the fall of 1944, Lawson, under oath, denied that he was

a member of

the Communist Party.

However, a highly reliable and delicate

confidential source, whose reliability has been well

established, but

whose admissibility in Court may be somewhat doubtful, has definitely

identified Lawson as a member of the Communist Party for the last twelve

years.

According: to

this source, Lawson was first a member of Branch K

of the North West Section of the Los Angeles County Communist Party until

that branch was reorganized in June, 1943, at which time he was transferred

to Branch A-3 (writers' branch) of the North West Section and held 1943

Communist Party Book #30198.

This very reliable source also stated that Lawson enrolled in

the Communist Political Association and was assigned 1944 CPA Card 41850,

and on December 10, 1944, according to the source, was again registered

for the CPA and was issued 1945 CPA Card 47275.

In the Communist Political

Association, Lawson reportedly was assigned to the special group which

was also known as Group #9 and was a member of the commission which was

the governing body of the Communist movement in the motion picture industry.

which replaced the North West Section's Executive Committee. Lawson,

according to the source, served on the commission for three

years.

It was further stated by this source that when the Communist

Party, USA, was reorganized to replace the Communist. Political Association,,

Lawson was assigned to the Davis Club and was issued 1946 Communist Party

Book #35392.,

, This source made available Lawson's 1946 registration card

which reflects that he was 50 years of age, a writer in the motion picture

industry, of American-Jewish descent, and that he had been in the Communist

wear and that no

Party for twelve years. This source has also identified Lawson's wife,

Sue lawson, as a member of the Communist Party and is in a position to

document the branches to which

1am in portion tonsc

she has belonged.

William Hynes (LA-3), a discontinued paid confidential informant

of the Los Angeles Office, has identified Lawson as a member of the Communist

Party in 1941 and has stated that Lawson is a "CP member, a playwright, and

Committee, she identified John Howard Lawson as a member, of the Communist

Party.

She stated that he was active in Communist circles in Hollywood

when

she

was in the Communist Party and that in Communist meetings, Lawson

had stated that Communist propaganda must be integrated into. all screen

plays.

On August 8, 1944, Walter Wanger, a Movie Producer, stated that

he definitely knew that John Howard Lawson was a Communist. This source

stated that a few days before he had contacted Lawson to see if he was

available to write a screen play to which Lawson replied he. was hesitant

to work for Wanger for fear it might cast some reflectión on him.

source quoted Lawson as stating, "I am a Connunist".

] Confidential Informant of the Los Angeles

office,

advised that he talked to John Howard Lawson on July 25, 1945, -at

which time Lawson stated that if he were called as a witness before the

state Un-frerican Activities Committee, he believed he would admiN

to them

that he was. a member of the Communist Political Association

On March 1, 1947, Ben Kadish, a confidential source

of

the Los

Angeles Office, and a former member of

the. Cormunist Party, advised that

he recalled John Howard Lawson's attending Communist meetings. This

source was in the Communist Party from September,

1943, through December,

1945, and for a time was in Branch A-3, which was the same branch to

which Lawson belonged.

B. Attendance at Communist Party Meetings

During the time that Lawson has been in Los Angeles, he has been

identifiéd as having attended numerous meetings at which all of those

identified as being present were known Communists, according to a highly

reliable and delicate confidential source. In those cases where the highly

reliable and delicate confidential source was not, in a position to iden-

tify the particular person as a Communist, the source that can so identify.

the person is mentioned.

There are set forth hereinafter

several examples

of this character of meetings which Lawson attended.

On February 7, 1943, Agents of the Bureau observed Alexander

Trachtenberg, head of International Publishers and a member of the National

Committee, Conmunist Party, USA, net with John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz

III. OTHER EVIDENCE OF LAWSON'S COMMUNIST AFFILIATION

"In July, 1941, a memorandum was furnished to the Chicago Field

Office by Colonel Walter L. Furbershaw, a representative of the Carnegie

Illinois Steel Company, which cited meetings of the National Committee

Plenary Sessions öf the Communist Party on June 28 and 29, 1941, in New

York City. . It was

stated in the memorandum that those definitely known to

have been present were William Z. Poster; James W. Ford; Alexander Bittel-

man and numerous other high ranking Communist leaders.

The memo further

related that John Howard Lawson

attended these national meetings as a dele-

gate from California and there is a notation to the effect that Lawson had.

been in New York for the previous few months in connection with theater work.

wood, he met Lawson and drank with him during the evening.

He said on this.

slaughter of the Kulacks. The source advised that Lawson stated to him that

he hoped the revolution would come here without bloodshed, but that it would

come "even with bloodshed if necessary".

The same source stated that two

years following this

incident, he attended a debate at the Roosevelt Hotel

in Hollywood where Lawson stated publicly that everything should be done to

avoid bloodshed and that under no eircumstances should this country set into

related that he got on his feet at this meeting and recalled

typical example of Hollywood red-baiting and refused to answer the question

put to him.

in the Hollywood area.

The November 9, 1943, issue of "New Masses" contained a full page

article announcing that John Howard Lawson had been made a member, of the

Board of Contributing Editors of New Masses.

This article quotes lawson

as saying the following with regard to this publication:

"I, read New Masses for two reasons:

¡first, because it is a

valuable source of information; second, because it is equally

valuable for its editorial

comment and

analysis.

Almost every

issue offers vital factual

material which cannot be found, else-

the American people want facts--

wherese they real de that the knowledge of facts Is indispens-

able for winning the war. They are heartily sick of the corrup-

tion and distortion in much of the commercial press., New Masses

gives us facts, and it interprets facts in terms of a consistent

philosophy of democratic action and purpose. I hope the magazine

can reach a much wider circle of readers because I am convinced

that a bigger circulation for this periodical will help us wir

the war."

On January 13, 1944, an article appeared in the "Daily Worker" beneath

the

photograph of John Howard Lawson in which he is quoted as stating:

"Grèetings to the Daily Worker on your 20th Anniversary. As

I look back over the years,' it seems to me that the Daily

Worker has been consistently invaluable as a snurce faceurate

news and a journal of progressive informed opinion.

no other American newspaper which has done such a fine job'in

effective news coverage and editorial service to the American

people and the American nation.

"I hope the Daily Worker's circulation and influence will in-

crease tremendously. If it increases in proportion to its merit,

it will reach millions of people".

A highly confidential source (technical surveillance. on Carl

Winter, Executive Secretary of the Communist Political Association, Los

Angeles County) advised that on July 22, 1944, Robert W. Kenny, former

Attorney General. of the State of Califörnia and then Chairman of the Cal-

ifornia delegation to the National Democratic Convention in Chicago, com-

municated with Ellenore Abowitz, Assistant State CID Legislative Directo

was in Chicago at this time, advised Abowitz that he would arrive in

Los Angeles by plane the following day and requested that she arrange

a conference for him with about five of the "right people". Abowitz,

according to the source, immediately conferred with Carl Winter,

Executive Secretary of the Communist Political Association of Los Angeles

County, concerning this matter. Subsequently a surveillance by Agents

of the Los Angeles Office reflected that this meeting was actually held

on Sunday, July 23, 1944,

at the home of Ellenore Abowitz with six

people in attendance. These persons included, in addition to R. W. Kenny,

Carl Winter, previously identified; Paul Cline, ex-Secretary of the

•Communist Party in Los Angeles County; Joseph Aidlin, member of the

State Central Cornittee of the Democratic Party in Los Angeles, and

John Howard Lawson. (4)(U)

It was also reported by this highly reliable sourcet that in

June, 1945, Doretta Tarmon, field representative of the New Masses, known

Communist publication, and Joe Foster, film critic for the New Masses, came

to Los Angeles from New York City to organize New Masses Benefit Rallies.

It was stated that both of these individuals held conferences with John

Joward Lawson.. According to the source,

an invitational benefit for the

New Masses was held at the home of Frank luttle, Movie Director, 6217

Rock Cliff Drive, Hollywood, on June 9, 1945, it being pointed out by

Manuel Seff, a confidential informant of the Los Angeles Office, that the

meeting was

by invitation only; that over $3,000 was raised at the meeting

-and that John Howard Lawson was one of those he recognized in attendance.

(X)(4)

In August, 1945, a highly reliable confidential source reported

that Lawson has been working on a book of American history for the past

couple of years..

The source stated that the book was in its final stages

and had been typed into script and had been criticized by various people

including leaders of the Communist Political Association in Los Angeles,

among them, Carl Winter, head. of the Los Angeles CPA. The source also

said that inquiries concerning it had also been made by Alex Trachtenberg,

former National Educational Director of the Communist Party, and currently

a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party.

The source in-,

dicated that since the change in the CP Line as a result of the Duclos

article, Lawson has indicated that he was going to take six months off

from his studio to revise the book.

He also told the informant that the

change in the Communist Party Line necessitated practically a complete

rovision of the book's depoint. (u)

material. However I am also convinced that this was merely a

loose way of talking to impress me with your seriousness, of

which I was already impressed.

"Adding my personal regards, and the hope that not long from

now we shall all be members of a functioning, militant, Marxist-

Leninist vanguard party devoted to the interests of our nation,

the peace of the world, and the liberation of mankind.

"Yours sincerely."

Subsequently, a highly confidential source (technical surveillance

on residence of Bruce Minton) advised that Minton was very. bitter against

Lawson and had made it known that he was "out to get Lawson". This source

indicated that Minton was of the opinion that the CPA in Hollywood was a

closed corporation and that he had referred to Lawson as the "rabbi" of

this group who ran it as a "tin god and in a dictatorial fashion". Similar.

repercussions regarding Lawson were reported by Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a

confidential informant of the Los Angeles Office.

Wolf advised that on

August 1,. 1945,

he had occasion to talk with a friend who was a member of

one of the cultural groups over which Lawson presided.

He said that this

person stated that the rank and file of the cultural groups were not

satisfied with the revisionistic policies which Lawson and Elizabeth Glenn

had followed during the previous year under the CPA set-up, and were

desirous of getting rid of Lawson and Glenn as leaders. Wolf further

revéaled that his informant definitely stated that Lawson was the leader

of the Communists in the cultural field and that he obtained the impression

that Elizabeth Glenn was Lawson's underling in an organizational capacity.

Wolf, a former member of the CPA, stated his informant was very bitter

• against Lawson and Glenn, not from a personal standpoint but from a Marxist

standpoint inasmuch as Wolf's informant thought that Lawson and Glenn had

misled the rank and file CPA members by their leadership and adherence to

the theory of revisionism. A practical example of what might have indicated

Communist leadership in the motion picture industry

was reported by a highly confidential source* who reported on July 19, 1945,

that Lawson had just returned from San Francisco and admittedly had not been

included in ary inter-Party discussions of the motion picture strike, it

being noted that the Communists, prior to the strike, had adhered to a

position of not aiding the strike and had urged its workers to keep the no-

strike policy of their unions.

It is to be observed that in 1946 Richard

Bransten and his mie, lath lickenty, were expelled from the communiot Party. (eu

VIII. ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES

. A.

HOLLYWOOD DEVOCRATIC COMMITTEE, later known as the HOLIYWOOD

• INDEPENDENT CITIZENS COMMITTEE OF THE ARTS, SCIENCES AND

PROFESSIONS (HICCASP); succeeded by the PROGRESSIVE CITIZENS

OF AMERICA

Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles

Office, advised that the Hollywood Democratic Committee was launched in

January, 1943, by persons engaged in the motion picture industry,

to obtain

national, state and local legislation essential to victory; to clarify

political issues and support candidates best fitted to serve the nation in

wartime and to cooperate with other organizations "whose aims are similar

to our own"; housing for defense workers, protection of labor's rights,

child care, humane treatment of juvenile delinquents and the end of negro

discrimination.

The same source stated on February 15, 1944, that the aims

and purposes and program of the Hollywood Democratic Committee had changed

very materially.

He indicated that its purposes had formerly been exclusively.

political, but

that now through speeches, public advertisements and sham

Americanism, it was attempting to enlist the support of non-suspecting

citizens,

under the guidance of the Committee, to exploit names of important

individuals in the furtherance of the Commnist Party line.

This informant

further stated that the program of the Hollywood Democratic Committee was

not only parallel with that of the Communist Party Line but that the organ-

ization was dominated and inspired by persons of a Communist character.

It is observed that in June, 1945, the Hollywood Democratic

Committee became a section of the Independent Citizens Committee of the

Arts, Sciences and Professions and that in 1946, it became known as the

Progressive Citizens of America. It should also be noted that this organ-

ization was not connected with the Democratic Party.

The following information with respect to the activities of

John Howard Lawson relative to the Hollywood Democratic Committee is set

forth to illustrate the direction and control exerted over this organiza-

tion by Lawson.

The most pertinent information in this regard was re-

ported to the sureau by a highly confidential and reliable source. (EXU

On March 4, 1943, it was ascertained by a confidential informant

of the Los Angeles Office,

Harvey Gilbert Wolf, that the Hollywood Democratic

Committee was in its formative stages and a meeting of the group was scheduled

at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel for that evening.

the meeting and a written report stated "before the meeting began; the

following known Communists circulated among those presert. They were

acknowledged by the audience generally which for the most part, gathered

around them, chatted and passed

remarks which would indicate that they

were well-known and 'in a sense looked up to." - Among those named by the

informant as being in this category were: John Howard Lawson and Herbert

Biberman, together with other Hollywood Cormunists. The purpose of the

meeting reportedly was to elect officers for the ensuing year and to adopt

a constitution. According to the source, the Hollywood Democratic Com-

mittee "will undoubtedly develop into a powerful Communist Party pressure

group in the near future. Using the war effort and the influence of power-

ful figures in the motion picture industry, this organization will have a

tremendous influence in putting over the Communist Party Line in Califomnia."

Further,

the source continued; the Hollywood Democratic Committee is definitely

a Communist "front" organization, and he asserted that John Howard Lawson

was among those proposed at this meeting to be considered for the Executive

Communist Party was being thrown into the local and national election cam-

paigns and that the Hollywood Communists, Party line followers and sympathizers

were engaged in this type of activity. He submitted the following report

with respect to the Hollywood Democratic Committee:

On August 11, 1945, the same reliable source advised that there

was some interest in having a State-wide meeting to announce Carlson's

candidacy or at least to discuss it with the Democratic politicians from

all over California.

However, Lawson, according to the source, said that

informant of the Los Angeles Office,

was of the opinion that it was not time

1945, the same highly reliable source advised that Lawson was to handle a

reception for Carlson to be given by Edward G. Robinson. It was indicated

that the Warner Brothers, Motion Picture magnets and other "big wigs" were

to be in attendance at this reception.

It was also indicated by this source

at the time that Orson Welles discussed with Lawson the chances of Carlson's

It was' said that Welles promised Lawson all he could

New Jork City organization of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts,

representatives from various cities where branches were located. Lawson,

otherwise remain autonomous. In a conference with Pete Lyons, an employee

discussion should be held at some time after the war.

Lyon said the New

lork Office needed more money and Lawson reiterated the Hollywood Committee

was very poor and did not desire to make any further committments at the

time.. Lyon was anxious that the HICCASP send someone to Washington or New

York to give Congressional leaders some tangible evidence of union between

the National organization and the Hollywood Committee

The source indicated

that Juavson agreed that this might be a good thing (U

On December 4, 1945, according to a highly reliable source*

the HICCASP held a rally, the theme of which was "Atomic Power and Foreign

Policy". The official announcements described this affair as an attempt to

make a realistic approach to the tremendous potentialities of atomic weapons

änd atomic energy.

This rally called for international use and inter-

national control of atomic energy, and in this connection, the reliable

informant pointed out that Lawson, through George Pepper, Executive Secretary -

of the HICCASP, carefully guided the program. It is interesting to doserve

that Ned Sparks, President of the Los Angeles County Communist Party, accord-

ing to the informant, contacted Lawson regarding this program and stated

that he felt more emphasis should be put upon American intervention in China

inasmich as that was the main part of the Communist line.. Lawson reportedly

agreed to this and stated that he would contact George Pepper to see that

American intervention in China was given appropriate attention at this rally

A highly confidential source* reported in September, 1946, that Lawsor

continued to be active in the affairs of the HICCASP and according to this

source, he frequently conferred with its Executive Secretary, Alice Hunter;

in fact, this source stated that on July 31, 1946, Hunter contacted Lawson

and asked him if it was all right if the HICCASP issued a statement that they

were not under the influence of the Communist Party. According to the

informant, Lawson stated it would be all right if it were done "carefully

and correctly".

This informant further indicated Lawson attends most of

the meetings of the Executive Council of the HICCASP and through close

liaison with Hunter, continued to exert an influential rule in the policy

of this organization.

It is noted that shortly thereafter the HICCASP merged

with the Progressive Citizens of America, described as a Communist-dominated CY

B. HOLLYWOOD WRITERS NOBILIZATION

The Hollywood Writers Mobilization,

according to Harvey Gilbert

Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles Office, was formed very

soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, and was established

by persons who were most active in the League of American Writers.

Accord-

ing to information contained in reports of the Joint Fact-Finding Committee,

California Legislature, based on information developed in connection with

interviews conducted of Hollywood writers in October, 1944, the Hollywood

Writers Mobilization was under the control of the Communists and had numerous

contacts to supply the pictures which are being released in the liberated

countries.

Confidential Informant Wolf advised that there was a close connec

tion existing between the League of American Writers and the Hollywood

Writers Mobilization.

The following data with respect to Lawson's connections with the

Hollywood Writers Mobilization is set forth to illustrate the direction and

control exerted over this organization by Lawson. Most pertinent informa-

tion developed relative to Lawson's control

of this group was obtained by a:

highly reliable and confidential sourcex

In Narch, 1945, a highly confidential sources advised that there

recently had been a strong difference of opinion between Robert Riskin,

head of the Overseas Film Bureau; Office of War Information, New York,

Philip Dunné, head of the Los Angeles OWI Film Bureau, and this difference

of opinion was concerned with scripts which had been submitted by the

Hollywood Writers Mobilization. This source indicated that Sidney Buchman,

Chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Editorial Board, discussed

this matter with John Howard Lawson.

Buchman advised that he had conferred

with Riskin who informed him that Philip Dunne had gone overboard on the so-

called "contrived" films (films based on fiction or so-called dramatic in-

cidents):

Dunne had apparently instructed the Hollywood Writers Mobilization

group that this was the type of film OWI desired to produce. Following

Dunne's instructions, according to the source, the Hollywood Writers Mobiliza-

tion had gone ahead and done scripts of this type and as a result many of the

scripts had been under fire by the New York Office of the OWI, where Riskin

was in charge.

It was further pointed out that Riskin was strong for

documentary films since he felt a responsibility to the State Department,

and further that misrepresentations were bound to arise out of dramatic

incidents in the "contrived" films thus making them more "vulnerable". The

source stated that both Lawson and Buchman agreed that this controversy.

between Dunne and Riskin would effect the Hollywood Writers Mobilization,

which they control, since most of the scripts already completed would have

to be redone. (C)(Ul

The League of American Writers, according to Havey Gilbert Wolf,

a confidential informant of the Los Angeles Office, was originated in

Kharkov, Russia, in November, 1930, and in the United States in 1935.

American Writers was formed in the fall of 1935, the purpose being to

bring the writers employed in the motion picture industry under the in-

fluence of the League of American Writers and the Communist Party, USA,

operating in the so-called cultural and intellectual fields.

The source stated that the Congress of American Revolutionary

Writers formed the League of American Writers, it being pointed out that

the latter organization was declared subversive by the Attorney General

stated that the recently organized Hollywood branch of the League of

American Writers was taking the lead in demanding that the State Depart-

ment permit the entry of Frederich Wolff, famous exiled German dramatist

and film script writer.

The wire sent to the State Department was

signed by John Howard Lawson, among others.

and were created by the Party to handle and protect comrades who became

involved with the law and also to seize upon those cases where the Party

can secure publicity. According to the informant, the International Labor

Defense has close contact with the workers and is usually operated by the

middle class of people.

A confidential source (trash coverage on office of Labor Research

Association, 80 East 1lth Street, New York City) advised that John Howard

Lawson was a sponsor of the Schappes Defense Cormittee which was founded

in New York City in July, 1941, to raise funds for and help prosecute the

defense of Morris U. Schappes former City College instructor who was

sentenced to a prison term in the State Penitentiary for perjury arising out

of a 1941 inquiry into Communism in educational institutions. The express

purpose of the Committee as set forth in one of its pamphlets was "to help

prosecute the legal defense, to acquaint the labor movement, the educational

world and the general public with the issues involved in this case, to raise

funds for the defense and to help Schappes support those dependent upon him.!.

On December 19, 1941, according to a highly confidential source*

an unknown, person contacted Lawson's wife to tell her of a very "pathetic

telegram" received from Edward Barsky, head of the Joint Anti-Fascist

Refugee Committee, it being noted that Barsky was recently given a jail

sentence for refusing to produce the records of the JAFRC for the House

Un-American Activities Committee. According to the informant, this tele-

gram read as follows:

"TRYING TO GET. FIFTY ANTI-FASCIST PEOPLE ON THE LAST BOAT OUT

OF LISBON. SEND MONEY AT GREATEST POSSIBLE SACRIFICE."

on January 16, 1943, a highly confidential source (technical

surveillance on residence of Herbert Biberman) reported that Biberman was

consulted concerning a letter issued by Mir. Kemitz, National Secretary,

National Federation for Constitutional Liberties, advising that this Committee

starting a campaign against the Dies Committee and wanted the Hollywood

people to do something about it. Although the informant was unable to

ascertain the name of the man with whom Biberman consulted on this date, 1943,

it was determined by another highly confidential source* on January 18,

that John Howard Lawson had directed Elizabeth Leach to pick up this letter

from Biberman.

It is noted that Elizabeth Leach was the Organizer of the

Northwest Section, Los Angeles County Conmunist Party at the time. It should

be noted that the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties was

declared subversive by the Attorney General on July 31, 1941, in that it came

The name of John Howard Lawson appeared as a sponsor on a

circular distributed by the American Youth for Democracy, 1567 Broadway,

Detroit, Michigan, dated December 20, 1945.

In November, 1945, according to a highly confidential source*,

Lawson conferred several times with Mildred Raskin, Executive Secretary

of the People's Educational Center, described as the organization created

and dominated by the Communists to spread Communist philosophy, and these

conversat zons mde it clear that lawson was becoming concerned over the

$3,000 or $4,000 which he personally had guaranteed for this organization

in the way of printing bills and incidental expenses.

The same source/

indicated that Lawson felt that the organization was not going to be able

to repay this money to him. During the same period, the same source was

present when Lawson conferred with Waldo Salt, Communist screen writer,

regarding ways and means of raising $5,000 for the benefit of the People's

Educational Center.

Lawson also advised this informant that he was planning

to take a hand in the reorgarization of the staff of the People's Educa-

tional Center, commenting that he did

not think that the personnel was

organized in the most effective way.

According to a pamphlet issued by the Los Angeles Workers School,

John Howard Lawson, together with Albert Maltz and other invited lecturers,

were to be the instructors at the course entitled "The American Democratic

Tradition", an eight week course, tuition $3.

The course was to be given

at the Unitarian Church, 2936 West 8th Street, Los Angeles:

Of all the

courses taught at the Workers School, according to this pamphlet, this was

the only one not being taught at the Workers School proper, located at 212

West 3rd Street, Los Angeles.

This course, according to the booklet, "will

be a lecture course dealing with decisive periods in the history of our

nation; the democratic conditions throughout the development of our people.

Beginning with the colonial period, the course will trace the growth, problems

and developments of the American tradition during the period of the Civil War

and reconstruction; it will deal also with the agrarian populist movement,

the First World War and the present war for national survival". It is to

noted that this is not the same course that was given by Lawson at the school

for the League of American Writers entitled "Our Democratic Heritage". The Los

Angeles Workers School, founded in 1939, according to the pamphlet, bases its

studies on the various teachings "in social science.. Marxism.. the theory and

practice of the working class and the people's movement throughout history".

The entire Board of Directors of the Workers School are Communists, according

to a confidential informant, Harvey Gilbert Wolf, who also indicated that

this school is the educational plant for the Communists in Los Angeles County.

The Daily People's World issue of September 19, 1946, carries

an article that the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Negro Congress would

convene on September 22, 1946, for a mass meeting called for the over all

endorsement of the Fair Employment Practices Act. According to this article,

John Tripp McTernan had been selected to lead a panel discussion on the topic

XIII. CRIMINAL RECORD

Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a confidential informant of the Los Angeles

Office, stated that at a lecture in June, 1942, before a school of the League.

of American Writers, Lawson stated that on the day that Sacco and Vanzetti

were executed in Massachusetts, August 27, 1927, he, Lawson had been arrested

in Boston for picketing the State Capitol.

With regard to this self-admitted

arrest of Lawson, the informant stated that Lawson became a labor agitator

many years ago and went to

Birmingham, Alabama, to participate in à strike

in the steel mills in that city in 1934. According to confidential informant.

Harvey Gilbert Wolf, Lawson was arrested on May 17, 1934, on a charge of

criminal libel growing out of an article which was written by Lawson in the

"Daily Worker", New York City Communist newspaper, defending a Connunist

organizer, Harold Rolston.

It is observed that Lawson's FBI number is

3021790 and that his record in this regard reflects that he was arrested in

Birmingham on May 17, 1934, by the Birminghem Police Department on the charge

of being a Communist. He was released on the same day.

Officer Harless of the Birmingham Police Department related the

following information with regard to the arrest of Lawson in Birmingham,

Alabama, May 17, 1934. Harless said that he recalled that the police broke

up a Communist meeting at which Lawson was present and that Lawson was' then

turned over to Officer J. T. Moser and Officer P. C. Cole who were handling

Communist matters at the time for the Birminghan Police Department.

this connection Captain C. I. Mullens of the Birmingham Police Department

stated that Lawson was defended by a lawyer named Harold Ralston from New York.

He also recalled that a woman named Jane Speed, a well-known Communist

organizer, was also present at the meeting at which Lawson was arrested.

records of the Birmingham Police Department further revealed the following

information regarding Alexander E. Rascolin, reportedly also arrested with

"This man is an International Labor Defense Attorney from New York

City. He was very active in 1934 and 1935 in Birmingham and was arrested by

the Birmingham Police on May 17, 1934. While in Birmingham, he contacted

severel lawyers in an effort to

secure their services in reading parts of

the International Labor Defense.

This man is very high in the Communist Party.

His Birmingham police number is WM-26589".

The New York Iimes morgue contained two articles regarding the

arrest of Lawson at Birmingham, Alabame.

The first article dated July 6,

1934, reflected that Lawson was arrested on that date and released under bond

of $300 to appear in Recorder's Court the following day.

The arrest followed

a conference between Mr. Lawson and five other New Yorkers and W. O. Downs,

Commissioner of Public Safety at City Hall. The article further revealed

that on May 17, 1934, Lawson was taken into custody by police, fingerprinted,

photographed and released. This article, referred to above, dated May 16,

1934, is also in the New York Times files.

INDEPENDENT CITIZENS COMTITIE OF THE ARTS, SCIENCES AND

PROFESSIONS (HICCASP), succeededly the PRoGRESSIVE CITIZENS

OF AMERICA

Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles

Office, advised that the Hollywood Decratic Cormittee was launched in

January, 1943, by persons engaged in the motion picture industry, to obtain

national, state and local legislation essential to victorys to clarify

• political issues and support candidates best fitted to serve the nation in

wartime and to cooperate with other organizations "whose aims are similar

to our on"; housing for defense workers, protection of labor's rights,

child care; humane trestment of juvenile delinquents and the end of negro

discrimination.

The same source stated on February 15, 194, that the aims

and purposes and program of the Hollywood Denocratic Committee had changed

very materially. He indicated that its purposes had formerly been exclusively

but that now through speeches, public advertisements and sham

Americanisin, it was attempting to enlist the support of non-suspecting

citizens, under the guidance of the Committee,

to exploit names of important

individuals in the furtherance of the Communist Party line.

This informant

further stated that the program of the Hollywood Democratic Committes was

not only parallel with that of the Communist Party Line but that the organ-

ization was dominated and inspired by persons of a Communist character.

It is observed that in June, 1945,.

the Hollywood Democratic

Committee became a section of the Independent Gitizens Committee of the

Arts, Sciences and Professions and that in 1946, L0 bacame known as the

Among those naned by the

informant as being in this category were: John Howard Lawson and Herbert

Biberan, together vith other Hollywood Coumunists. The purpose of the

neeting reportedly was to elect officers for, the ensuing year and to adopt

a constitution. According to the source, the Hollywood Democratic Com-

mittee "will undoubtedly develop into a poverful Communist Party pressure:

group in the near future. Using the war effort and the influence of power

ful figures in the motion picture industry, this organization will have a

tremendous influence in putting over the Communist Party Line in California."

Further, the source continued, the Hollywood Democratic Committee is definitely

a Communist "front" organization, and he asserted that John Howard Lawson

B. FOLIYWOOD WRITERS MOBILIZATION

The Hollywood Writers Mobilization, according to Harvey 01lbert

Wolf, a confidential informant of the

Los Angeles Office, was formed very

soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1942, and was established

by persons who were most active in the League of American Writers. Accord-

ing to information contained in reports of the Joint Fact-Finding Committee,

California Legislature, based on information developed in connection tith

interviews conducted of Hollywood writers in October, 194l, the Hollywood

Writers Mobilization was under the control of the Commnists and had numerous

contacts to supply the pictures which are baing released in the liberated

countries.

(100-10221B-14)

tion existing between the League of American Writers and the Hollywood

Writers Mobilization.

The following data with respect to Lawson's connections with the

Hollywood Triters Mobilization is set forth to illystrate the direction and

control exerted over this organization by Lawson. Nost pertinent informa-

tion developed relative to Lawson's contrgl of this group was obtained by a

recently had been a strong difference of opinion between Robert Riskin,

head of the Overseas Film Bureau, Office of War Information,

, New Tork, and

Philip unne, head of the los Angeles OHT FiIm Bureau, and this difference

of opinion was concerned with scripts which had been submitted by the

Hollywood Writers Mobilization. This source indicated that Sidney Buchman,

Chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Editorial Board, discussed

this matter vith John Howard Lawson. Buchnan advised that he had conferred

with Riskin who inforned him that Philip bunne had gone overboard on the so-

called "contrived" films (films based on fiction or so-called dramatic in-

cidents) Dunne had apparently instructed the Hollywood Writers Mobilization

group that this was the type of film Oll desired to produce. Following:

Dunne's instructions, according to the source, the Hollywood writers lobiliza-

tion had gone ahead and done scripts of this type and as a result my of the

seripts had been under fire by the New York Office of the OUT, where Riskin

was in charge.

It was further pointed out that Riskin was strong for

documentary filns since he felt a responsibility to the State Department

and further that nisrepresentations were bound to arise out of dramatic

incidents in the "contrived" films thus maling them more "winerable".

The

source stated that. both Lawson and Buchman agreed that this controversy

batween Dunne and Riskin would effect the Rollywood Writers Mobilization,

which they control, since most of the scripts already completed would have

to be redoné
