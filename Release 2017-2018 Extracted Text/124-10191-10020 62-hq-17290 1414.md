NOTE CONTINUED:

For record purposes, the following is noted. An

analysis of actions against King recorded in the memorandum

of 12/18/75, plus those carried out against King, the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Poor People's

Campaign, and the Sanitation Workers Strike, under the

Black Extremist and White Hate and CPUSA Counterintelligence

Programs revealed the following statistics:

In 1962 one COINTELPRO-type action was carried out

against King, none in 1963.

From 1964 through 1966, there

were 28 actions approved.

From 1/1/67 through the assassi-

nation, 4/4/68, only eight actions were taken.

Following

the assassination through 1971, there were only nine actions

taken.

Seven of these actions

concerned the Poor People's

Campaign.

The Committee desired the alphabetical and numeri-

cal listing of official and confidential files of former

Director Hoover to determine which, if any, of these files

would be of direct HSCA interest.

This matter was coordi-

nated with Mrs. Lottie Martin, Special File Room.

Committee was previously provided, from the official and

confidential files,

a file concerning King and the personal

files of former Assistant Director Sullivan, whose personal

files were incorporated into the alphabetical and numerical

listing.
