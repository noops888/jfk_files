On November 20, 1963, MM I-1, another Government

agency which conducts intelligence investigations, advised

that the following information had been received from a

member of a group of Cuban emigres trained in the techniques.

of information collection, which group has provided useful

reports for over two years:

On November 2, 1963, a meeting was held by the

Democrata Cristiano (MDC), during which Laureano

*Batista Falla made an analysis of the MDC's military poten-

tial.

Batista concluded that the potential is almost nil,

because no ship could move out from the Miami River without

encountering problems. In addition, Batista said the MDC

does not have sufficient financial resources to move to

Central America.

that he continues as head of the military section of the

MDC.

Batista said the MDC was organized as a politi-

cal party in 1959, and is still a political party, although

it does have an action group. The MDC would like to separate

Itself from this action, or military group. Batista is in-

terested in forming a unity organization with the action

and military groups of the different anti-Castro organiza-

tions.

Batista

sald he had been negotiating military ac-

tion unity with the Comandos-I organization, but this unity

never materialized. The early negotiations between the two

organizations were to establish a mutual exchange of intelli-

gence and military equipment.

Batista would have liked to

have seen this unity develop into a unity of all action groups,

with each individual group discontinuing its former iden-

tity. Batista said that although he disagrees with Manuel

Ray, head of the anti-Castro organization Junta Revolucion-

aria Cubana (JURE), he would work with JURE, and thinks

Ray operates a very efficient organization.

Batista said that every six months the members and

Executive Coumittee of the MDC hold a conference during which

This

policy covers the social, military and economic plans of the

MDC are under obligation to follow this policy for a six-

month period, at which time another congress is held.

or two, and that he did not know where Batista could be

located. Galnares said the 1964 green Volkswagon bus,

Florida Registration ID 59360, is the property of Laureano

on a Signa-type fishing boat, with another small, fast

boat accompanying it. About seven or eight persons went

on this mission.

Photographic equipment, medicine, and a

few small arms were taken. The purpose of the mission was

to infiltrate several people into Cuba.

As of January 27, 1964, Batista was three days

overdue in returning to Miami.

On January 27, 1964, Mr. Schachter, U. S. Customs

Agency, advised that about five days previously, a U.S.

Coast Guard airplane spotted a Signa-type boat near Racoon

Cay, Bahamas, which cay is about fifty miles off the north

cap teed

shore of Cuba. It was believed that this Sigma-type

fishing boat was identical with the one owned by Laureano

Batista Falla.

The U. S. Boast Guard notified British authori-

ties who dispatched a British frigate to intercept the

Sigma-type fishing boat. It was believed that if the British

did not arrest and detain the occupants of the boat, the U. S.

Coast Guard would bring it and its occupants back to Miami.

On February 3, 1964, local police, Miami, Florida,

located the Sigma-type fishing boat at Crandon Marina,

Mamt, Florida, and noted the boat was abandoned, but contained

On February 3, 1964, MI. Schachter advised that

two crew members had returned

tained by U. S. Customs authorities who confiscated the

boat.

On February 3, 1964, Fidel Alberto Zaldivar

Laureano Batista Falla. Zaldivar said he used the boat

periodically. for commercial fishing, and had returned to

Miami on the boat at about 1 A.M. on February 3, 1964.

boarded a commercial airplane and flew to Nassau, New

Providence, where he spent two days and then returned to

Staniel Cay with a new fuel pump for the boat.

The boat

then departed Staniel Cay and via northwest Providence

Channel, arrived at Great Isaac Light, and from there

returned to Miami, Florida, arriving at about 1 A.M., on

February 3, 1964.

Zaldivar stated the boat contained no automatic

weapons, no guns of any articles of war. The purpose of

the mission was to bring refugees back to the United

States. These refugees were friends of Enrique Infante.

Zaldivar stated the mission was not an MDC operation, as

such, and the persons on the boat went together voluntar-

Ily, rather than at the directions or orders of the MDC.

Ruiz stated he, along with Fidel Zaldivar,

Angel Vega, Leovino Interan, Enrique Infante and

Laureano Batista Falla, departed from Miami about

January 8, 1964.

They were aboard the "Sigma X,"

& thirty foot commercial fishing boat owned by Batista,

but did not have any arms or articles of war aboard the

boat.

They subsequently arrived at Nurse Cay, Bahamas, :

waited nine days for Cuban refugees to meet them, and af-

ter running low on food and water, decided to return to

Miami.

They put in to Staniel Cay, and lay there for

about five days while Batista went

to Nassau to obtain

a new fuel pump for the boat. The "Sigma X" boat was in

bad operating condition; the motor would only give the

boat a speed of about six knots; and, there were other

difficulties with the motor besides the fuel pump. The

"Sigma X" returned to Miami about 1 A.M., February 3,

1964, and was left at a marina because of motor failure.

Ruiz and Zaldivar went into Miamf and located

a couple of friends who also had a Sigma-type fishing

boat.

These friends volunteered to tow the "Sigma X"

back up the Miami River where repairs could be made.

when Ruiz and Zaldivar got back to the "Sigma X," they

were detained by U. S. Customs Agents, and the boat confis-

cated.

Ruiz stated that none of the occupants of the

"Sigma X" went ashore in Cuba or went near the Cuban

coast, but they did

go ashore in the Bahamas.

Ruiz advised they encountered no British frigate

or other government boats, but did see a U. S. Coast

Guard plane fly over them.

Ruiz advised the trip was not

authorized by any branch of the U. S. Government, and was

made without U. S. Government knowledge.

On February 6, 1964, Laureano Batista Falla advised

he had no comment concerning any information to the effect

that he may have been out of the United States and in the

Bahamas during the past month.

Batista stated as the Military Security Officer

of the MDC, his duties are to brief MDC officials on general

military matters as they affect Cuba. The organization has

not authorized him to carry out any military operations. If,

and when, Batista is Involved in military activities in

cuba, he

iIs in no way acting as an agent of the MDC.

Batista said that he helped found the MDC and he

created the post of Military Secretary. He continues in

this position, and nobody in the organization has sought

the position or has objected to Batista's having this

position. Batista said that all the equipment used by the

Military Section of the organization is Batista's personal

property, paid for by himself, and in no way belongs to

the organization.

Batista said naturally he has some opposition in

the organization. Some people consider him as being at

odds with U. S. Government policy. Batista said it was his

opinion that the United States political aims and foreign

policy does not coincide with that of the Cuban exiles. To

work with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 1s to work

for the U. S. aims and goals, which are not necessarily the

aims and goals of Cuba for Cuban exiles.

According to Batista, there is no mutual field

of interest between the United States Government and Cuban

exiles. For the U. S. Government to overthrow the present

government of Cuba, is to resolve a United States problem,

not a Cuban problem. If Cuban exiles would overthrow the

present government of Cuba, there would still be many U. S.

Government problems not resolved. Batista said he had in

the past visited Washington, D. C., and conferred with

U. S.Government officials in an effort to establish a mutual

field of interest where Cuban exiles and the U. S. Govern-

ment could work for mutual benefit, without success.

Batista

charged that while the U. S. Government complains there is

no unity among cuban exiles, he believes the United States

actually does not want unity. He alleged that during 1960,

when the Frente Revolucionario Democrato existed, and

later became the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), a

unity organization, the CIA still worked against unity

of Cuban exile groups.

He said CIA did not work for

unity within the CRC, but dealt with each individual or-

ganization on different terms. CIA refused to work with

the leaders of the CRC as representatives of the several

organizations. He alleged this policy has persisted to

the present time.

Batista

stated that military operations from the

United States against Cuba would probably be continued by

himself and other MDC members. They prefer to work in the

Miami, Florida, area, because of its closeness to Cuba,

good facilities for operating boats, availability of the

large number of Cubans to serve as mechanics, and to do

other necessary labor.

Batista said that many of the Cuban exiles in Miami

have jobs, can contribute money, and can work for organiza-

tion on weekends and during their off hours. The large

community in Miami, Florida, makes it easier for the Cuban

exiles to obtain necessary equipment to go on military ex-

peditions against Cuba.

In addition, he alleged that in Latin America,

United States diplomats Influence the local governments

to stop the Cuban exiles from going on military missions.

He said when they are stopped by the local police in Latin
