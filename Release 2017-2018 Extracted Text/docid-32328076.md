On September 28, 1957, PCI Pedro P. Tapia, who is

employed as racing director at the Oriental Park Race Track

outside of Havana, advised that approximately three weeks ago

CUbA

known /associate of CARMINE DI BIASE, IO #2871, subject of

Bufile 88-8893, had taken over the gambling concessions in the

casinos in the grand stand and in the Jockey Club at the Oriental

Tapia indicated that LEVINE had squeezed out

FREDESVINDO BOSQUE, the Cuban gambler who formerly operated

these two casinos.

Rene Alarcon, a representative of the Bureau for

the Repression of Communist Activities (BRAC) who is assigned

to duty at the Oriental Park Race Track during the racing season,

advised that LOWELL BIRRELL has leased the track in its entirety

from the owners and that BIRRELL, in turn, has leased the track

to an individual named JACKXPURCELEVSHayana files reflect that

BIRRELL is a known associate of GEORGE/ LEVINE but reflect no

information concerning JACK PURCELL. Alarcon said that LEVINE

had apparently put up $50,000 for the right to take over the

operation of the two gambling casinos at the track and that this

CONTAIN

money had gone to PURCELL.

Alarcon said it was not known from

what source LEVINE might have obtained this money since LEVINE

INfORMATION

SHOWD

was not known to have any money of his own.

Alarcon informed

that-LEVINE was being assisted in his operation of the casinos

by MICHAEL, LORIA, FBI

17041961

It should be noted that LORIA

has previously been observed

working at the Hotel Nacional

gambling casino and, therefore, the possibility exists that

MEYER LANSKY's money may be behind LEVINE. S

OTHERWISE

Extra copies of this letter have been prepared for

forwarding by the Bureau to the New York and Miami offices. -The

Bureau is requested to furnish Havana with any available information

concerning JACK PURCELINE a

In this regard it should be noted that

Oriental Park Race Track indicates that

PURCELL is the general marager of the Cuban Racing Company, Inc J
