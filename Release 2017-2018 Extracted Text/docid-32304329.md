PCI SUE YOUNG is a high-priced Hollywood call

girl and quite incidentally a close friend of the notorious.

private detective FRED TASE,a man who stands convicted

of horse race fixing.

CALIF

Yesterday SUE told SA's

she had been contacted by

OTASH the previous evening the wanted information as to

her possibly participating in sex parties involving

PETER LAWFORD, FRANK SINATRA, SAMMY DAVIS, Jr. and Senator

JOHN KENNEDY.

SUE said she told OTASH she has no knowledge of

such activities involving these men, and to this OTASH

responded with a request that she name any girls who

might have been used at parties with them.

SUE said she is unaware of any indiscretions or

girls Involved with the four men specified by OTASH, and

she told him so.

Yesterday the same SA's had occasion to talk to

OTASH at his office and during their presence the private

detective inadvertently - or his actions indicated inadvertence -

indicated that some operator, unnamed and unidentified, is

attempting to spy on Senator KENNEDY's hotel room.

OTASH

indicated that Confidential magazine is quoted "looking

for dirt on KENNEDY or LAWFORD"

for use in a planned series

of articles for publication between now and the election in

November.

Last evening, again Ã¤ccording to SUE YOUNG, OTASH

phoned her wanting to know if she could arrange an Introduction

to Senator KENNEDY. He suggested that he would like to equip

her with a recording device for taking down any "indiscreet

device for ta

statements the Senator might make.

SUE refused the invitation.
