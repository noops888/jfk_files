PH 614-C-TE reported following activity 6/25/63:

PETE PANTELEO lost election in Operating Engineers'

Union last week, and is trying to make appointment with

BRUNO, presumably for help or advice.

BEN GOLOB told source MICHAEL MAGGIO, deceased,

asked DOMINICK POLLINA to step down and let BRUNO become

"Boss." BRUNO didn't want job but is now "eating it up."

GOLOB

added he once had good vending machine business in

Trenton, N. J.

BRUNO urged him to sell out, set up in Miami.

After GOLOB complied, BRUNO himself went into same busi-

ness in Miami.

BRUNO and wife met PETER MAGGIO and family in

Dominican Republic on recent trip, but did not return

together.

BRUNO met with several

henchmen at Lyndy's

Restaurant during afternoon.
