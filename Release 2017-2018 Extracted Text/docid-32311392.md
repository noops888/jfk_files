the name or address.

she did not, but that

she desired some names and addresses fron SMAII for the Academy MEl(U

MORA stated that the Congress was to be a large

world-wide affair and that the President of Mexico would

open it. MORA stated that if SMALI knew of any "progressive"

Congress, she would like to have their names and addresses.

she claimed that she was also making up a list and that any

list SMALL might provide could overlap but that she wanted to

have a very good list.

She added that persons attending the

Congress would have to pay their own transportation but that

their hotel and all expenses would be paid for during the

duration of the Congress.

MORA cited as example of persons

In May and June, 1963,

the source advised that,

according to MORA, the communist revolution in Mexico 1s no

longer a wild dream. She claimed that the PCM had concocted

a feasible plan calling for taking over in Mexico within ten

years.

She claimed that the revolution would necessitate

bloodshed and that trained soldiers would be necessary.

She

stated that leaders, both Mexican and foreign, had been

trained to set up small units similar to the ones operating

in Venezuela and many of their skirmishes never reached the

newspapers.

She also stated that the PCM, within the previous

year, nad operatea a school in Mexico to train leaders for

that revolution.

She stated that when the revolution comes,

It will need outside help which has been promised from Cuba

although Cuba will not necessarily be the country of origin.

She implied that financial support would come from the

Russians or, more probably, the chinese. The PCM will have

a support function providing assistance and an underground,

as well as food, shelter, and men when possible.

She claimed

the PCM could provide cover temporarily and finally furnish

provisional local government in areas which are taken over.

It was expected that fighting men would be recruited from among

the controlled PCM farmers' organizations fA

On September 17, 1963, MEX-18 advised that the subject

introduced the source to an individual, subsequently identified

as GURGUEN MAKSABEDIAN who is now a member of the Federal

District Committee

MORA claimed to the subject

that MAKSABEDIAN was a member of her branch which was described

as the leadership branch of the PCM although admittedly that was

a descriptive title and not the name of the branch. MAKSABEDIAN

subsequently outlined to the informant his concept of how the PCM

could take over Mexico through exploitation of the discontented

middle class, and when the informant discussed this matter with

MORA, MORA stated she was aware of the plan and it was already

being Implemented which was why FRANCISCO MORA wanted to quit

the PCM since FRANCISCO MORA did not consider such a program

to be a genuine communist revolution. According to MORA, the

so-called Leadership Branch was composed of leaders in various

fields and she qualified because of her position as a department

head at the University of Mexico San Carlos Campus and her

husband was in the Branch "on a pass"

mainly because of her position that he was accepted.

MORA

further advised that FRANCISCO MORA had lost the fight within

the so-called leadership branch against the concept outline

by MAKSABEDIAN and that after ten

"screaming" branch meetings, .

the branch, except for herself and FRANCISCO MORA; voted

unanimously with MAKSABEDIAN C(U)

going from her residence and therefore she did not want any

persons who were not politically trustworthy around her

on October 8, 1963, the informants advised that on

october 6, 1963, MORA borrowed 500 pesos ($40 U.S.) from

the informants to make up a deficit from the funds she had

collected from the imprisoned railroad workers' families.

MORA stated she had expended the money for something else

and would have to turn the total sum in the next day. MORA

stated

she had money in a savings account in an unidentified

pank but it would not be possibre to withdraw this money

without

a delay of eight days.(U)

On February 24, 1964, the informants advised that

on that date ELIZABETH MORA stated that FRANCISCO MORA was

extremely nervous over trying to have clandestine meetings in

their residence while her mother and the children's friends

were sitting around.

mother is a conservative,

him a bottle of Czechoslovakian vodka.

FRANCISCO MORA waS

Intoxicated. During the party, he repeatedly demanded state-

ments from ACGM associates present to support the Chinese

position in the Sino-Soviet split and he also urged full

support for the Negro Nationalists in the United States.

Informants received the impression that ELIZABETH MORA intended

to advise them of an important matter which had come up in the

Czechoslovakian Embassy during their visit but she was upset by'

her husband's inebriated condition and did not tell her story

Progressive Labor Group is a catchall for the Negro Nationalists

who are now leaving the CPUSA. She also stated there were

more Negro Nationalists In SNCC and CORE than in the NAACP/(U)

On April 22, 1964, informants advised that ELIZABETH

MORA had told them that FRANCISCO MORA had just made an arrange-

ment to rent an isolated hacienda near the City of Pachuca for

the use of a group of important visiting Negroes from the United

States who are expected to arrive in Mexico about the weekend of

She did not further identify the visitors nor

May 8, Y the purpose of their visit but invited the informants

to join the group at the hacienda after the visitors arrived.

On May 12, 1964, however, the informants advised that the pro-

posed weekend in the hacienda did not materialize. ELIZABETH

MORA had dropped the question, and the informants

received the

Impression that either visitors did not arrive as scheduled

or, if they did, objected to the presence of two white persons

the ranch so

that the invitation was dropped although

on both April 26 and 29, 1964, MORA had again confirmed the

invitation. au)

on May 15, 1964, the Informants advised that on

the previous two days ELIZABETH MORA stated that she had

received a letter from ROBERT WILLIAMS in Cuba which she

"said

proposed far more violent and emphatic procedures against

white people than had previously been offered by anyone else.

She said she was astounded that he would assume her support in

this matter as he knows her to be a member of the Mexican

Communist Party, implying that such membership would preclude

her from approving such violent means. MORA also claimed that

Negro woman, AUDREY Or AUDIE MORE Or AUDREY Or AUDIE MOORE

(phonetic) in Los Angeles, who was formerly a communist, 1s

now carried on the mast head of WILLIAMS' publication "The

Crusader"

as an editor of some type.

MORA indicated she was

disgusted with WILLIAMS.

MORA read to MEX-18 portions of one

Of WILLIAMS' letters which stated that guns must be obtained

and aimed at white men from the windows of homes. The infor-

mant observed that this is the type of statement

made nightly

by WILLIAMS on his radio broadcast, but MORA stated she does

not listen to his programs since their radio does not receive

Cuban stations (Aus

MEX-18 advised ELIZABETH MORA of the statements made

regarding her by GERTRUDE SOLTKER, but MORA stated she was not

concerned over any misunderstanding of her situation at the

Czechoslovakian Embassy or with any friends she wanted to have.

To prove her point, she stated that she and FRANCISCO MORA

had been guests of the Czechoslovakians twice that week.

MORA

claimed that one of those meetings was a dinner attended by the

Czechoslovakian Ambassador; the Ghana Ambassador; with two

other Ghana Embassy officers; and two American Negroes whom

MORA claimed were important members of MALCOLM X's staff.

She

claimed that during the dinner MALCOLM X and Black Nationalism

were toasted frequently and there were two toasts for China

and several for the Czechoslovakians but none for either Russia

or KHRUSHCHEV. Subsequently, that evening MORA went to the

Ghana Embassy to act as translator for a member of the

Czechoslovakian Embassy who went there but could not under-

stand the version of English spoken by the Ghana diplomats.

The meeting at the Chana Embassy was not attended by the

alleged representatives of MALCOLM X. Informants were unable

to ascertain the complete purpose of

those meetings but MORA

stated that MALCOLM X was going to tour Africa and particularly

wanted to go to Ghana.

MORA advised the informants that the

meeting at the Czechoslovakian Embassy was not the meeting she

had previously stated would be held with the important Negro

visitors from the United States, but that it was part of the

same thing.
