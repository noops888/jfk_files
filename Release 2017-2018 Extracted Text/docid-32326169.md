Teamster officials.

deathly afraid

of being arrested and is ripe for intensified

interrogation."

"John B. Stevenson, former West Coast attorney for

Teamsters Union, is close associate of Brewster and Dave Beck.

Stevenson now semi-retired and lives in Honolulu.

His office

in Los Angeles is run by attorney Charles K. Hackler whom

Hoffa does not respect..

Hackler pays Stevenson $400 monthly

although Stevenson does not work.

Stevenson holds approximately

80% of Matula's cash. Stevenson has a boat in Honolulu where

it is suspected that currency may be hidden. "

points (both at the time he mentioned them originally and

upon subsequent recontacts) into a letterhead memorandum

memorandum should bear the same caption as this airtel and

should be forwarded to the Bureau by cover airtel. The
