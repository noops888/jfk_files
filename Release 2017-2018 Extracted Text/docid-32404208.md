RELEASE I FULL

2013 August 1993

Following is for PAI's background should questions be raised

about inconsistencies in the redactions of the JFK

documents:

- There are many duplicate documents, which may not have

been

sanitized exactly

the same way by different reviewers

in every instance.

- Our procedures for declassification evolved over the

past year, so that more information was released in

reviewed later compared to documents reviewed

earlier.

- The physical quality of many documents is poor.

- Some documents were sanitized elsewhere in the Agency

earlier.

So we were dealing often with redacting materials

already sanitized for other reasons e.g., for release to the

House Assassinations Committee.

- Not all the documents released are CIA documents. Many

are press items, third agency.

- We will be doing followup review of the documents

after the 22 August deadline to reconcile inconsistencies.
