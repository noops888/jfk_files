During the planning sessions MYER remarked that all

tour participants were required to obtair receipts for any

expenditures made on the trip because AFSC was not paying for

the entire trip, and justilication of expenditures was necessary.

Must aid not, however, indica:e who the financial backer for the

trip was.

The group was to spend approximately three days visiting

with the North Vietnamese Paris Peace delegation and then to fly

to Hanoi for four - five days in North Vietnam.

MOXER informed the tour participants that they were chosen

because of their past involvement in the peace and antivar movements.

The source observed that none of the tour participants appeared

especially radical or militant, but vere, for the most part,

"enthusiastic, energetic youths from upper middleclass families."?

The group was to take no supplies or medicines to US

prisoners of war and in response to a tour participant's suggestion

that the names of prisoners of var be taken so that correspondence

with their tamilies could be initiated upon the group's return,

MOYER responded

that such was not the purpose of the trip and

was

not suggested.

MOYhR urged that the tour participants not deviate

from the above limited purpose of the tour.

The source noted that in association with MOYER the trip

THE MOVEMENT FOR A NEW SOCIETY IS

a network of collectives working to bring about fundamental

nonviolent change. These small groups often arise from already

existing friendships or ties of workplace or religion.

The groups use a variety of names depending on the basis of

their affinity. They seek to live the revolution now, experimen-

ting with simplified and shared lifessyles, even while preparing

for the emergence of a mess revolutionary movement.

The small size of the groups heips te maximize individual par

ticipation and encourages individue! and group growih; their

participation in the lovement for a New Saciety neiwork u

ites them with a larger movement.

Curently groups and individuals are experimenting with the

Movement for a New Society approach in California, Oregon,

Washingion, Wisconsin, Ohio, illinois, Minnesota, Indiana,

Michigan, Kansas, Maine, New York, Pennsylvanic, Maryland,

North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. An exchange of iceas

and resources with the nonviolent movement in Billain, Japon,

Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zeclond makes

MNS people hopeful of the prospects of a transnational network.

Sisters and Brothers!

With the election year come and gone, and the Indochina war changing its shape, where are

movament people?

Where else, but working, innovating, reflecting, trying to build a movement for real change?

For many of us that's meant getting closer to the grass roots. The Movement for a New Society

is doing that. But there's no sense in getting isolated. For one thing, that's an invitation to

repression.

(We lost our non-profit mailing privileges because of a complaini about our news-

letter, Dandelion, advocating war tax resistance. Last week Keith Miller of the

Philadelphia Life Center was sentenced to two years for refusing induction. These

things add to our sense of the repression potential in this society,)

Gine way to prevent isolation is to exchange information on what we're doing. Enclosed

is our newest effort to say what we're into.

Innovation is preity important to us. That's partly why some of us laid down A Quaker

Action Group - however useful it was in the 19:0's, its structure and style didn't seem in

novative enough for the 1970's.

So here you'll read where we are in our journey toward a more relevant, more attracrive;

more human, anc: more radical approach to change. That journey is long. So we're also

into seli-criticism, conscious learning and changing of ourselvas, serious confrontation with

our sexism and our old cliches which sometimes substituted for analysis.

We'd be glad for raactions and criticism from you, our comraces in the struggle. There's

a whole loi more wisdom in the movement collectively than in the individual organizations

and activists.

Let's share - and grow, and struggle, and celebrate!

struggle

ON A TOUR OF THE UNITED STATES, Danilo

Dolci, the famous Sicilian grassroots organizer,

was asked what he thinks of nonviolence.

He

replied, "I don't believe in norviolence." He

paused, and there was time for the audience to

wonder if Dolci had abandoned the nonviolent

approach after so many years of commitment to

it. Then he said, "I believe in nonviolent ac-

tion; I believe in nonviolent revolution."

Too often the call for "nonviolence" has been a

call for peace at the cost of justice, un effor

to suppress the conflict instead of waging it. If

we acknowledge the gross injustice and the

powerful vested interests in this country, we

must aiso admit that conflict is necessary for

fundamental change.

Those who profess to favor freedom,

and yet depreciate agitation, are

men who want crops without thund

er and lightning. They want the

ocean without the awful roar of its.

waters.. This struggle may be a mo-

ral one; or it may be a physical one;

or it may be both moral and physi-

cal; but it must be a struggle. Pow

er concedes nothing without a dem

and. It never did, and it never

will. Find out just what people will

submit to, and you have found out

the exact amount of injustice and

wrong which will be imposed upon

them; and these will continue till

they are resisted with either words

or blows, or both.

Struggle begins in a variety of ways. Conflict

may result from building an alternative institu

- Frederick: Douglass, 1857

tion which becomes so threatening that an Est

ablishment agency tries to harrass or destroy it.

Or it may come when you stop paying your war

taxes or carrying a draft card. Your group may experience repression as it acts in solidarity with

a local union strike or joins in a boycoti action. Conflict nearly always comes when you carry out

a deliberate nonviolent campaign for change.

CAMPAIGNING FOR CHANGE

The first step in building a campaign for change is to choose a goal which is consistent with your

analysis of the "big picture" of social forces. There is little point in working on reformici goals

which have no relation to a long-range strategy for fundamental change.

Second, educate! Focus on the groups most likely to respond, und the groups whose action can

bring about the change. Street speaking and other dialugue methods con test your approach to

see if it is sectarian or irrelevant.

"Third, organizel Connect the forces on your side to each other; catalyze new relationships which

go beyond the one-dimensional

politicking of the Old Order. Laun

erably connected to the issue

are raising.

Fourth, negotiate! You need to meet the opponent fa :3-to-face really to know where things are;

role-play beforehand, of course. This step can really: larity the situation for all parties.

Fifth (if your goal has not been reached), confront! Reduce the problem and solution to picture

form, so that no words are necessary in order to explain what the confrontation is about. (The

1960 sit-ins in the U.S. South were a good example of that.) The picture should show the gap

between a widely-held value and the particular injustice. Take group action which paints the pic-

ture in vivid colors. The campaign should build to a crisis, in which the authorities are put in a

dilemma; if they allow the demonstration to go on, fine because the action is dramatically pointing

up the situation of injustice. If they repress the demonstration, all right, because their repression

further reveals the violence on which the institution rests. If they accept the demand, you cele-

brate.

FACING REPRESSION

The government's own force can work against itself, as in jiu-jitsu, when it is met indirectly. In-

stead of pitting guns against repressive violence, meeting the opponents on their superior ground,

the movement responds nonviolently. This often has to effects: it begins the process of demoral-

izution of the police and troops, and it discredits the government in the eyes of the public.

Voluntary suffering is dynamic when we can stand it without fleeing. For most people that requires

preparation. The repression we may experience in struggle is sharing in the suffering already ex-

perianced every day by millions of people, but doing it for change instead of suffering because one

cannot get out of the way.

By changing our ideas about ourselves, by

developing a strategy we have confidence in,

and by training in direct action tactics, we

con get recay for open struggle. By joining

others in small affinity groups we develop the

solidarity necessary to face repression. The

MNS is a netivork of groups such as NRGs

(Nonviolent Revolutionary Groups) which

practice mulval aid at the "crunch" -- at

the time when it is most needed.

Campaigns for specific change frequently fail

to achieve all their aims. Campaigns, like

citernative institutions, take part of their

mening from the larger strategic context.

While Rosa Luxemburg may have been exag-

gerating when she said that revolutionists

would lose every baitle except the lost, her

point is still sound: when we have an overall

strategy for fundamental change, we need not

be discouraged when we do nor reach all our

compaign objectives.

Which is more important-national or local action?

Which is more important in a book-the paper or

the ink? Obviously there will be no revolutionary

nonviolent movement in this country without strong

grassroots organization and national struggle. No city

can be transformed unless the nation changes drasti-

cally. Our society cannot be changed neighborhood

by neighborhood,

The false dilemma results from short-sighted

strategy, which either projects a confrontation some.

where (e.g., Washington, DC) and then urges us to

drop everything for that, or digs into a neighborhood

somewhere and forgets about national impact.

Sound strategy links the levels in a multi-level

movement. The strategy underlying the NRG's con-

nects national struggle to grassroots organizing.

As an NRG nears the crunch on a significant issue,

resources from the network of groups and communi-

ties can join the struggle to make it successful. Some-

times, the struggle can achieve national or even

international proportions. As Martin Luther King Jr.

found in Birmingham and Selma, a national struggie

can grow out of local work, shaking the federal

government from a thousand miles away.

¿ nose spontaneous reactions are like the symptoms in a body's nervous system which reflect dis-

case or injury. They alert the social body that something is wrong. They do not necessarily tell

as what is wrong or what to do about it.

to discover what is wrong requires analysis. To discover what to do about it requires, first, vision,

nd second, strategies for change. From analysis, vision, and strategy will come actions which

are more than cries of pain, actions which are steps in our liberation.

analysis is a continuing process. Action based on analysis tests our understanding and puts new

vestions to us. Action and analysis should go together. If we insist on having a near-perfect

OUR VIEW OF IT

At least six overarching forces shape this

world with an impact felt even on the

corporate capitalism, militarism, statism

racism, and sexism.

ently, to be an unmixed blessing. After

-sources and

the ecosystem on which our very life depends

is befouled with industrial pollutants. Econ-

omic growth is the altar before which much is

sacrificed. High consumption is offered as

the condition for happiness. The American

middle class level of consumption is the goal

for much of the world.

That goal cannot be reached. Non-renewab-

le resources in metals and fuels are too limited

to allow such a consumption level. Food pro-

duction cannot be increased indefinitely. The

ecosystem cannot tolerate the resulting levels

of pollution. The population of the world is

already too large and is growing at an alarm-

ing rate.

The major organizers of exploitation in the

West are the corporations. Wealth and power

are concentrated in relatively few hands, even

in many societies which call themselves demo-

cratic.. The huge multi-national corporations

are already more powerful than all but a few

nations, and are still growing. They are res-

ponsible to no publio; profits for their owners

are their first priority. These corporations,

most of which are linked to the American sup-

er-ich, dominate and impoverish the Third

World. Despite the immense wealth which

flows into the U.S, from overseas, a ghetto

dweller can tell us how little trickles down.

• Support for such a system requires a huge mil-

Trary machine. It is not an accident that the

United Siates is first in military might, and

treins and equips most of the armies and po-

lice forces of the world. Militarism in the

U,S, adds to corporate profits at home as

well as preserving corporate access to mark-

ets and raw materials abroad. Military con-

tracts, most of which are awarded without

competitive bidding, provide lucrative prof-

Tis for industry. Whole communities, large

portions of certain industries, and a vast la-

bor force have become dependent on the

maintenance of the military apparatus.

Exploitation and militarism are not confined

to capitalist

auntries, of course. Huge ar-

mies are ma!

wad at the border of China and

the Soviet Union, presumably not under the

orders of the bourgeoisie. Moscow has, in

ine name of the proletariat, ruled harshly

over its own workers and those of Eastern

Europe; more than one workers' revolt has

been quelled by Russian tanks. The dis-

ease of statism - whether the bureaucratic

centralism of the Soviet Union or the fascism

of Spain, turns upside down the principle

that the state should serve the people.

* Racism and sexism deny us the benefits of

equal life chances, deny us a common dig-

nity, and foster conflict among peoples who

should be allied against the power elites of

military-industrial societies.

Racism in the United States is strengthened

by unequal opportunities for education and

training. Minorities are at a disadvantage

in competing for jobs in a high unemployment

economy; that, in turn, reinforces patterns

of segregation in housing, churches, and

schools.

Rigid sex role definitions trap both men and

women. Women work hard and are supportive

to children and men, at a high cost to them-

selves. Women are expected to defer to male

initiative and to limit their horizons to home

and child care. Men are expected to be comi

petitive, stoical, eager to leave the nest each

morning to ear the bread. Persons of either

sex who do not fit easily into these definitions

have hard going, and if they grow to love

members of their own sex, the discrimination

against them is compounded.

Corporate capitalism, militarism, statism,

ecological crisis, racism, sexism - these

are some of the pervasive realities of pres-

ent society. They invite the disintegration

or sudden destruction of this society within

a few decades. Whether a new society can

emerge depends on our ability to envision

new institutions and develop life-centered

strategies for building them.

vision

SOCIAL CHANGE MOVEMENTS OF THE LAST DECADE have often spelled out some specific

goals for a better society: racial equality, peace in Vietnam, women's rights, clean air. But

their vision has rarely broadened beyond a single issue.

Im the short run, there are advantages to the single-issue approach. But a new society cannot be

buili that way.

The probiems are connected to a structure of power which strongly resists meaning-

ful change. The goals are connected to each other in a way that reduces the chance of reaching

them one at a time. Further, there is the force of nihilism - of cultural emptiness - which can-

not be countered by tackling one institution at a time. The ideas for changing particular institu-

tons need to come together in a vision which offers hope and life. Without a vision, the people

parish because we need a vision to sustain us through the hard times of struggle.

You need men and women with years of experience- in

farming. small business, teaching, city planning, recre-

ation, luedicine, and on and on--to start discussing and

writing about ways to organize that part of society they

know best. ... You need to provide outlets via forums, dis-

cussiona, papers and magazines for the pent-up plans and

ideals of literally millions of well-trained, experienced

Frustrated Americans who see stupidity and greed all

around them but can'tdo a thing about it.

HOW WE SEE IT

There is among MNS people a growing consensus on some of this outline. We see a new society

not as a rigid utopia free of conflict, but a place of life and joy and movement. It should value

women and men, blacks and whites, adults and children, intellectuals and manual workers equal-

ly. A variety of life-centered cultures will exist rather than a homogeneous mass. Access to

knowledge and art will be a right. Celebration and self-discipline will have new meaning in a

milieu which serves human liberation.

Human beings must live in harmony with the earth. This probably means a zero growth rate in the

near future for both industrial production and population, with the utmost use of recycled materials

and non-polluting sources of energy. This will mean a decreased level of consumption for most

Americans, who have been using far more than our share of world material and energy resources.

Economic enterprises should be socially owned, decentralized, and democratically controlled.

Workers control is feasible when the enterprises are not enormous; parlicipation by consumers

in decision-making is also important in some productive units. The object of production will be

social use rather than private profit. Alienation from labor will be minimized by sharing routine,

repetitive work, by participating in decisions about the product, and by co-ownership of the

enterprise.

The spread of incomes will be reduced, perhaps to a ratio of 4 to l for maximum-to-minimum

incomes. In other words, there will be no rich as well as no poor. Basic needs for food, shelter,

medical care, education, and mass transport will be met free or at low cost. Income must be

earned; it cannot come from the labor of others.

Decisions would be made by participative, democratic means. Politics would be based on the

fece-to-face community of citizens, extending upward to the global level. Transnational inst

irutions will deal with humankind-sized functions (such as the development of the sea-bed), but

the emphasis will be on decentralizing all possible activities for the sake of democracy. Nation-

states as we now know them will cease to exist.

There will be less cause for mass, organized violence when wealth is redistributed and racism

rooted out of institutions. Conflicts will inevitably arise, however, and when they break into

the open will be fought with nonviolent means of struggle such as noncooperation and bodily

unarmed intervention.

THE QUALITY OF LIFE WILL INCREASE for nearly everyone, even while the sheer quantity of

appliances and gadgets will decrease. The crime which is spawned by poverty and cultural empt-

iness will no longer haunt our streets. The consumer goods we do own will not wear out quickly.

The air and water will be clean; stars again will be clear in the airy skies. We will not be torn

apart by war. The possibility of inflation and unemployment will not worry us. Assured health

care will free us of much anxiety. Work will regain its meaning, and leisure will be more crea-

tive because of increased access to cultural goods and to each other.

training for nonviolent

social change

LEARNING IS NOT NEUTRAL. It serves either to domesticate us, or to liberate us. Nonviolence

training is a learning process. Its goal is to facilitate human liberation - to bring about fundamen-

tal and empowering change.

Essential to this learning for change is the process of "consciousness-raising," which involves a rad-

ical change in the way we view ourselves as individuals in the present society, and as participants

in the historical process. For reality is not a set of conditions which surrounds us and controls us,

and to which we must resign ourselves, bur reality is an ever-transforming process which we are

creating. Until we recognize this power and this responsibility, we cannot bring about any funda-

mental change. But once we come to this realization and begin to live our new awareness, action

to change the world becomes a necessity.

Nonviolence training can have a number of different emphases:

1. PREPARING FOR DIRECT ACTION PROJECTS. Historically, this is how training is best known.

Participants in integration sit-ins organized by

the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in the 1940s were required to attend evening workshops, in-

cluding discussions of fears and feelings and roleplaying of anticipated experiences. In the 1960s

"marshals" were trained in methods of nonviolent crowd control for large anti-war demonstrations in

Washington, D.C. By 1972, the emphasis had switched to "participant training" -- preparing as

many participants as possible to take responsibility.

Training for nonviolent direct action can now include choosing tactics, working out logistics, and

preparing participants. Preparation can include roleplaying, brainstorming, guerrilla theatre, and

other exercises. *

2. BUILDING A MORE SUSTAINED MOVEMENT. The People's Blockade of arms to Indochina be-

gan when a small group of individuals came to-

gether to translate their concern about the war into an envisioned action. Brainstorming and strategy-

guming were especially helpful as they developed a campaign. Training for larger numbers of parti-

cipants took place during the actual campaign, and helped it to grow nationally. Other groups have

found scenario-writing important in developing long-range strategy.

3. EXPLORING ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENCE IN OUR LIVES. Nonviolence training has played an

important role in the development

of neighborhood block safety programs in West Philadelphia, the highest drug crime rate area in the

city. Through workshops, many residents found alternatives to calling on police and to responding

to violence with violence. The new ways were not on ly morally more desirable, but also enabled

ut neighborhood safety. The work

is also served an important

relating to others as human beings, in spite of our fear or anger.

4. RAISING OUT LEVEL OF AWARENESS ABOUT OURSELVES AND THE WAYS IN WHICH WE

INTERACT. Observation and group dynamics exercises make us more aware of the dynamics

operating in groups, and more sensitive to group task and maintenance needs. Role-

playing can make us more aware of our own behavior tendencies.

Listening exercises and trust games

sensitize us. A careful evaluation and discussion bring out possibilities for change.

Alienation often results from rigid role expectations based on sex, race, or age. Training processes

can be helpful in enabling us to identify these feelings of alienation, understand them better, and

change them.

Nonviolence training has learned much from re-evaluation counseling, ransactional analysis, and

sensitivity training as reaffirmation of individual worth is incorporated into training workshops.

5. LEARNING ABOUT NONVIOLENT THEORY AND STRUGGLE. Past nonviolent struggles can

inspire us to action, and suggest

approaches to change. Use of nonviolent direct action case studies (of such actions as the Montgom-

ery bus boycott or Gandhi's salt campaign) have been important ways of learning about nonviolent

history in workshops and discussion groups. In Japan recently, training groups tried developing their

own strategy given an historical sitution, and then compared it to what actually happened. Training

exercises heip to introduce nonviolent theory in the context of a real conflict, situation.

6. SHARING SPECIFIC SKILLS. This could include learning to facilitate training workshops them™

selves, as well as running a mimeograph machine, chairing a meet-

ing, changing diapers, taking pictures, baking bread, and others. These tasks are a valuable part

of building a movement and a new society. When knowledge and responsibility are shared, the like-

lihood of drudgery or "meaningless labor" are lessened greatly. In this sense, training is a democra-

tizing process.

Training for nonviolent social change occurs through involvement in all aspects of the Movement for

a New Society. Life Centers, which are now taking form in several places, offer not only partic-

ipation in a series of workshops dealing with various aspects of social change, but also involvement

in direct action, community, and alternative institutions. Training structures often become a regul-

ar part of sharing and decision-making processes. Shorter-term workshops are facilitated by several

training collectives, with areas of concern and amount of time depending on the interests and needs

of the group. Groups which have participated in nonviolent training have include university groups,

anti-war groups, organizational staff, high school students, church groups, and even a group of vol-

unteer nursing home visitors. •

community®

People who are working for radical social change often feel insecure in

our present day world.

Our values and priorities are being challenged

and changed. Institutions are crumbling. The ecological crisis is

closing in on us. Nuclear weapons are proliferating. Political

repression is around the corner. It is all so overwhelming and

confusing.

Activists need to come together to guard against despair - to help each other to

cry and to find the occasions for laughter. We need to stimulate each others' imag-

inations of what the future can be and of how we can get there. We need to simp-

lify and organize our life together so there is time for confrontations that are needed

if the old order is to fall.

Leaming to live contentedly without high consumption goes against the grain of

our culture, but is possible in the context of community. Incomes can be cut if

every family does not have to have its own laundry facilities, tools, automobiles,

houses, etc. Concern for the ecosystem adds to the need for developing a simple

yet adequate life style. Simplifying our lives also means pruning our scatter of ac-

tivities to focus energy and to provide time to be present to each other. Many peo-

ple are finding their present occupations incompatible with their life goals and with

the way they like to live. As part of a community it becomes more possible to risk

making radical changes in employment.

Several forms of community are developing within the Movement for a New Society network. In

some groups individuals continue to live in separate houses as before, but interact with each other

on many levels. They study together and try to form a common analysis and vision out of which will

grow common action. At the same time individuals often share personal experience, problems and

joys. They offer practical help to each other (food-buying, child care, transportation) and may

even move into the same neighborhood.

Other people in the MNS are sharing homes together. A family finds another family, or they may

prefer to share with people who have no children of their ovin. Single, young people may fill a

house, or the commune may be composed of people of various ages. One house we know has ten

people ranging from age 16 to 58, with one married couple, one couple that is not married, and

six singles.

In some places clusters of communes and individuals form a wider community of people moving in

the some direction. When such clustering is deliberate the community can have a rich variety of

special interests, talents, temperaments and lifestyles - and yet maintain a feeling of belonging

and common cause.

It is not easy to build a community, of half a dozen people or of many times more. Most of us are

reared to be individualistic and rather egocentric and have trouble coordinating our daily routines

with those of other people. We are used to making decisions on our own and find it hard to remem

ber to check important matters out with our community. Fome of us find it difficult to be open about

our financial situation or about the fact that we need help with personal as well as practical prob

We struggle to find ways to express disagreements and cinoyances in honest but helpful ways. For

those who live communally there are the inevitable questions of housekeeping standards, child care,

expenses, and time devoted to development of a close co,munity as opposed to time devoted to the

world "out there." And then, of course, there is the question of intimacy. As people leam to

share on a deeply personal level, it is safe to assume that sexual feelings arise.

CONFLICT IS NATURAL

The first step toward solving problems in a community is to recognize that conflict is natural and

inevitable. It may even be desirable in order for the community to grow in depth and commitment.

However, most communities that we know find it necessary to establish procedures for dealing with

problems as they come up. Regular meetings (e.g. weekly housemeetings in communes) are essen-

tial to prevent annoyances from growing into problems. Also, without common planning there will

be misunderstandings and uneven sharing of work. Before community members feel comfortable

enough with each other to express neyutive feelings, short periods set aside for "gripes" can be use

ful. In addition to providing a safe way to express conflict, communities find it useful to do things

together that bring out their common joy and a sense of belonging.

We are excited about struggling to find the answers that are right for us at this time. Our vision of

a new society is helpful as a framework for finding better ways of relating to each other now.

Since our vision of the future includes egalitarian and decentralized decision-making structures,

MNS communities do not develop around "gurus." Rather, conscious efforts are being made to en-

courage full and free participation by everyone, Training in nonviolent action and knowledge of

group dynamics give us useful ways of dealing with problems of leadership, reticence, ambiguity of

goals, etc. People with leadership qualities

are a valuable asset to a community, but such

ability should not carry any special privilege.

Since we are working toward a non-sexist soc-

iety it is clearly impossible to divide the work

of the community along traditional sex lines.

We are not trying to reverse the roles of men

and women or to erase leadership abilities or to

suppress individual differences. We are, how

ever, pressing for equal sharing behween men

and women of family maintenance tasks, of con-

munity participation and of breadwinning.

Communities often last only a short time, but

then longevity is not necessarily a sign of suc-

cess. A community will have succeeded if the

participants leave each other es more integra

ted people than when they came together, more

able to cry and laugh and struggle with others,

and with more skills and inspiration to sorry on

the revolution.

alternative institations

Nonviolent revolution is a meaningless concept

as long as the present institutions have such a

stranglehold on our lives. Protesting I. T. Ta's

interference in the affairs of Chile while son-

tinuing to buy Wonderbread, calling for aca-

demic freedom while allowing the universities

to be funded by big business and the Depari-

ment of Defence, and talking about socialism

while not struggling to take control over work-

ing conditions, are futile gestures.

The majority of us through working and consum-

ing actively build the sysiem as it exists today.

Alternative institutions provide us with a way of

breaking this stranglehold, enabling us to take

power into our own hands. At their best they

also provide us with working models of what

life in the new society can be like.

Recent years here seen a great proliferation of

alternative institutions. There are few areas of

either production, distribution, or service in

which experiments are not being made.

Free universities in both the United States and

Europe offer courses the established universities

do not, and experiment with different methods

of learning. An interesting alternative school

is the Scotland Road Free School in Liverpool,

i England. It is operated by the children and

community, and attracts truants from the reg-

ular schools.

The Community Associates Printing Collective

is an MNS group in Philadelphia. Members of

the collective share skills and make decisions

by means of consensus. The Scott Bader Com-

morwealth is a worker-controlled chemical

factory in England with gross sales in the mil-

lions. The managers are elected by the work-

ers; important decisions are made by the whole

factory.

There can be few cities now without at least

one food co-op. At the Whole Ecrth Learning

Community in Madison, Wisconsin, the smoll

paid staff is rotated every six months so that

more people can learn the skills. Former

staff are encouraged to carry the store's phil-

osophy to other areas.

The Neighborhood Repair Group in Philadel-

phia offers home repair and decorating ser

vices to the community as well as income to

its members. Both skilled and unskilled mem

bers go out on each job so that skills are

shared. Vocations for Social Change groups

give guidance to people who want to work in

alternative institutions and in other non-ex.

ploitative types of work. In Britain, Uncar-

eers provides the same type of service.

Among the many other types of alternative

institutions are: child care co-ops, skills

co-ops, alternative pharmacies and health

care clinics, land trusts and credit unions,

crafts collectives and book co-ops.

To make work more human and satisfying, al-

ternative institutions must experiment seriou

ly with organizational forms, collective wors

ing and skills sharing. To avoid hierarchy

and outside financial control only those wha

work in them should take part in decision

making. In food co-ops, for instance, each

member should share the work as well es the

benefits. Otherwise the co-op is merely a

money-saving club; this happened to many

of the older co-ops both in Britain and U.S.

To be politically relevant alternative institu

tions need to develop an analysis of estab-

lished institutions and a programme to chal-

lenge them. Alternatives people need to join

nihars in a movement for revolutionary social

change, Wherever possible alternative insti-

tutions should relate to activist groups involved

in immediate confrontation campaigns and

should be flexible enough to free members to

take part in these. During the People's Block-

ace, the Ploughshares Co-operative Restaurant

and Bread Company in Washington State releas

ed a member to take part in the Blockede and

supplied those taking part in the action with

Food.

Our ultimate vision is one in which alternative

institutions are able to produce, transport, and

distribute all necessary and useful goods. They

will meet more and more of our social needs.

in that way existing institutions lose their grip

ail. Long before we reach this stage the

existing institutions will feel threatened anc

wil! try io repress the alternatives. To prevent

this repression from being effective, alternative

inctitutions need to cooperate and support each

other. This is beginning in Madison, Wisconsin,

where cooperatives have set up a sustaining

Fund.

T.a Movement for a New Society strengthens

this community of support and solidarity by

connecting alternative institutions with other

important aspects of the social change move-

Front.

What kind of strueture should a nonviolent

revolutionary movement have?

Surely the traditional forms of organization,

from ITT to the PTA, will not do. They ex-

hibit the authoritarianism we seek to cure.

The goals of the revolution must be incorp-

orated into the very wey it is organized.

Thus, the movement we build must be egal-

¡tarian and decentralized.

mns structure

ticipants share their lives as well as works,

often living communally. These groups con

arise out of shared interest in a particuler

issue, existing friendships, or other comm

oraliries. Six to twelve people is a gosd

size. When a collective becomes too leite

it can divide, aiding the proliferation of

MNS groups.

The Movement for a New Society is build-

ing a naiwork of small groups working for

radical nonviolent social change. It is an

association of participating groups rather

than individual members. All power with

in the MNS is bosed in these groups; all

groups tre striving to beceme intemally

egalitarian.

Although each group is autonomous, it is

responsible to the others in sharing ideas

and experiences, making decisions that af-

feet the whole network, and mutual aid in

times of crisis. The criteria for participat-

ing groups is acceptance of these responsi-

bilities, egalitarian internal structure, ag-

reement on strategic nonviolence, partic-

ipation in developing an analysis of the

present system and in projecting revolu

tionary goals,

The small groups, or collectives, are the

basic units in the Movement for a New So-

ciety. They are groups within which par-

LIFE CENTERS are larger communities with the primary purpose of

aparing effective social

change agents. The intensive learning experience involves workshops on various aspects of the

revolution, participation in direst action projecis, and the experience of living in a community

based on changed lives and changed values.

OTHERS: Innovative forms of collective organization are being developed to suit the function

and needs of particular groups.

The Movement for a New Society is still in formation. The network is being developed on several

levels - local, regional, and continental - with each small group participating in the discussions

and decision-making at each level. Two ways this harpens is in the network meetings and in the

more informal gatherings sometimes called celebrutions.

Celebrations are times of sharing joys and sadnesses, music, food, dancing, and discovering and

strengthening the spirit of community. They oceur both locally and on a larger scale.

The first continental network meeting, involving iNS people from California to Maine to Florida,

was held in Modison, Wisconsin, in November, 1972, Regional and local network meetings are

either functioning or foreseen. Although the meetings ure open to anyone, delegates from each

MNS group are expected.

Decisions in the network are made by consensus, a decision-making process that depends on a

group reaching general agreement rather thon oring. By using consensus, people explore issues

more carefully and are more sensitive to each others' feelings; the decisions are more likely to

be mutually satisfactory.

The "office" of the continental Movement for a New Society is presently in Philadelphia, and is

maintained by the Continental Movement-Building Collective, This group has the particular task

of facilitating communication throughout the nehrork, but also it promotes MNS ideas, stimulates

new groups to form, and raises funds. MNS gmups are working to share the responsibilities of the

Continental Movement-Building Collective, We hope that the collective's members will be repre-

sentative of the whole network, both geographically und in range of interest and experience.

Groups wanting to join the Movemeni for a Now Society are referred to the MNS group geograph-

ically closest to them, for exploration of what is tavolved in joining the network.

Discussions on our structure are continuing wishin the MNS; we are mindful of how we grow and the

influence of structures on us as persons. In common with others working for social change, we seek

to plant the seeds of democratic work and life row to increase the chance of an egalitarian new societ;

of the future.

20 South 12th' Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19I07

(275) LOcust 7-3150. Cable, AQAGPHILA

September 30, 1969

Dear Friends:

The trips to Cuba planned for the past summer were postponed when

the Cuban government asked us to delay application for the visas until

late fall or early winter. The reason stated was that there were already

too many Quaker groups coming to Cuba in the summer.

A Quaker Action Group's Latin America Committee has decided not to

proceed with the plans for the summer workcamp idea but we are still

planning to approach the Cubans with our proposal for a project to

challange the economic boycott on Cuba. While the specific arrangements

and details of the project may change during the negotiations with the

the Cubans, the general idea is for a team of about 8 people to sail to

Cuba with a gift of medical textbooks or some other desired iten.

Possibly, these Cuban people's organizations will send a gift to

, the

poor people of the United states.

The team would bring the gift back

to be distributed by a poor people's organization here.

As you can

tell, the plans are not detailed but are open to discussion and change

,when meeting with the Cubans.

The boat, LAVENGRO is now in Florida ready and waiting fox the plans

for the econonic boycott project to proceed. The captain, Robert Wilson

wis keeping the Lavengro ready to sail.. In the next week or so,

representatives from iQAG plan to meet. with our Cuban contact to reopen

negotiations on the project.

I am presently doing

research on Puerto Rico and the Guantanemo Base as

these are two places where other Latin American projects would be

affective, and where the United States plays an obvious role.

Your ideas

•concerning future projects in Latip America would be appreciated,

There has not been much communication about Latin America recently

because I have been in Mexico for 6 weeks, studying Spanish and traveling.

I hope to keep you better informed of developments concerning, out latin

America program in the future.

The "Mondcivitano" is also at the same boat yard and is

scheduled to go in drydock for painting and repairs in the

near future.

It is noted that SCOTT HERRICK is a member of the'

its adherents that the Cuban Government requested a delay in

the application for visas by potential participants.

Each recipient contact logical informants and sources

to determine if this group intends to sponsor a trip to Cuba

at any time in the near future.

Any positive information

developed as a result of these

inquiries should be submitted in

form suitable for dissemination.

NOTE:

AQAG orignally planned to sponsor the trip or a

group to Cuba during October, 1969, and appropriate instructions

were issued to the field to determine circustances surrounding

this travel. At the request of the Cuban Government, the AQAG

postponed its proposed travel as there were too many

quaker

groups going to Cuba last summer.

The above inquiry to recipient

offices is necessary to clarify the current status of this

situation.

obedience against inmoral laws and practices in harmony with a group discipline of nor-

rioïence.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ARTICLE I?

The founding fathers recognized that wartime

circunstances could dangerously encowage the con-

centration of power in the chief exccutive, eroding

the intended control by the people's representatives.

So Article I gives Congress alone the power to de-

claze war, and both Houses must concur. Congress

Iikewise is given control over ar-supporting appro

priations, principally as a check to Executive

authority.

CONGRESS HAS BICOME A RUSBER STAMP

si. By giving its powar to the Executive Branch

- And besoning the "Silent Kinoritz"

FIO MAKES DECISIONS FOR WAR OR PEACE

IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH?

It scens the Gonerals make most af those des

cisions with the consent of the President. But

it isn't just the Generals in the Pentagon.

Conerals Thieu and Ky seem to make many decisions

with the consent of the Pentagon Generals. .

President. Nixon said a13 U.S. forces would

be withdram fron Cambodia by 'June 30

Ky called this "a silly arguent by silly

paople"

Then Presideni Nixon said he would provide

millery support for the South Vietnam Army

in Cambodis after June 30

Horbicides kill thousands of acres of the

soctions of jungle growth, but also trees in vil-

lages and along streams.

The whole ecology at

Vietnam is being dangerously changed.

The so-called tear gases - CS, CH, Dil are

used to flush whole villages out of their shelters

where they can be bombed or herted into rafuges

camps and their ancestral homes destroyed.

On the site research has revealed that sono

of these chemicals do permanent damage to the

WHY we are urgumst (5W:

We see the military effort of the United States

Southeast

Asia as a deláberate genocidal policy against the Vietnamese

people. Herbicides and defoliants have killed a large percentage

of crops resulting in starvation mostly among civilians. Cases

CS, CN, Dil are used to flush whole villages out of their shelters

where they can be bombed. Studies have shown that poisoning and

extreme birth defects result from some of these chemicals.

WASHINGTON WEEKLY ACTION

Each Friday at noon we plan to engage in Nonviolent Direct

Action at the centers of death in Washington,

These actions

will involve civil disobedience as we seek immediate with

drawal of U.S. military forces from all of Indo-China.

particular, we will be focusing our actions against the ar

senal of Chemical and Biological Weapons which allow the

United States to continue this war.

C3W is especially in-

portant to our country's imperialist foreign policy, as the

United States could not continue its program of limited

wars in this atomic age without Chemical and Biological

Weapons.

We must keep the heat on Washington: On Junes we demon--.

strated with street theater on the Capitol steps the hor

rible reality of CBi as used in Vietnam. On June 12 we

will demonstrate with leafletting, teach-ins and corridor.

A STRATEGY FOR CHANGE

Democratic processes in

the United

"States have

deteriorated

and the power

of the

military-industrial

complex has

increased.

Conventional

means of pro-

test and

change have proved inadequate

without an added

turned to violent

power.

Some

have

means for that added

power.

It is our conviction that non-

riolent action of &

Gandhian

character,

which includes civil disobedience

and

ror-cooperation,

can provide the

moral

thrust

and

power to end the Vietnam War

and

stop the production and use

of

chenicel

weapons.

Nonviolent

action

has the power

to

charge mens's hearts

arid

minds and change outrorn institu

tions which perpetuate tre war in Viet

It has that power

hen those en~

gaged

icld orenly and firmly to truth,

have a

spirit

of non-injury to the

opponent,

and are willing to take suf-

fering on

themselves.

A CALL DO ACTION

open up the base for public inspection;

SPONSORED BY A QUAKER ACTION GROUP (AGAG)

A source who has provided reliable information in the

past advised on September 30, 1970, that approximately twenty

five people connected with A Quaker Action Group (AQAG)

departed on foot from the elipse at Washington, D C. to march

to the Pentagon.

The group was led by LAWRENCE SCOTT, Executive

Director of AQAG. They arrived at the Pentagon at approximately

11:30 AM and went to the River Entrance where they distributed

flyers protesting Chemical and Biological Warfare (CBW).

The group was young and both black and white.

Some members

attempted to enter the Pentagon to plant a small pine tree in the

center court as a symbol of life. General Services Administration

(GSA) Police denied them entrance and nine were arrested for

leafleting inside the Pentagon when they refused to leave.

Others planted' a tree outside the Pentagon in front of the

River Entrance in an area approved for the purpose by

Pentagon Officials. Leafleting also continued at other

entrances.

Members of AQAG returned to the Pentagon 10/1/70

and fourteen of them entered the River Entrance, again led

by LAURENCE SCOTT, in an attempt to plant a pine tree in the

inner court of the Pentagon. After refusing G.S.A. officials'

requests to leave, five people were arrested for refusal to

disperse and blocking the doorway. The remaining demonstrators

planted another pine tree in front of the Pentagon. Others

handed out literature against Chemical and Biological Warfare.

Those individuals arrested on September 30, 1970 and

October 1, 1970 were taken before the United States Magistrate

DAVID HOPKINS advised that charges against all those arrested

were dismissed in the United States Magistrates Court on his

A Quaker Action GrOUp

information in the past, advised on December 15, 1970, that

demonstrations are scheduled to take place on the island of

Culebra, which is used by the Atlantic Fleet of the United States

Navy for target practice, in late December, 1970 through January

The source stated that activists in Culebra have

organized various forms of resistance to the Navy.

"Swim-ins"

and "stand-ins" on beaches have attempted to stop

the bombing and

shelling.

Contacts have been made with United States radical

groups; in particular A Quaker Action Group (AQAG). This group

has been involved in illegal actions in the past such as the

disruptive actions in the Panama Canal Zone in March, 1969.

Now,

along with members of the war Resisters League (WRL.

they are

organizing an operation which has, as its ultimate objective,

the elimination of United States

control over Culebra.

"three dimensions" of this project are:

I. The "rebuilding of a chapel which the Navy

destroyed"

2. Staged peaceful confrontations with Naval

personnel in Puerto Rico and the Mainland urging them to "support

self-determination for Puerto Ricans and Vietnamese"

ReBuairtel to WFO, 3/11/71.

WEO has covered past protest demonstrations of

A Quaker Action Group (AQAG), the most recent having been on

2/26/71 when a small group of less than a dozen persons

demonstrated in Washington, D. C. (WDC). against the bombing

of the island of Culebra off Puerto Rico.

WFO has not covered meetings held within the

William Penn House at 515 East Capitol Street, WDC, as the

activities of AQAG have generally been peaceful and legitimate.

A review of WO indices failed to develop any

information concerning an individual who appears to be

Chie

identical with one JAIM?ERNANDEZ, a Chilean member of

MEMBER CI DUDUCER LSGSIZATION

It is brobable that MARGARET DE MARCO is identical

with one MARGARETYDE MARCO, born 8/26/42, who was one of

eleven members of AQAG arrested on 5/28/69, charged with

"unlawful entry" on the East steps of the Capitol in WDC

The group, at the time of arrest, was reading a list of names

Governor Ferre announced in San

Juan that the Navy would not use 11

ammunition after Jan. 1, 1972 and

would leave Culebra

entirely in 197

This announcement seems compromised

by a further sentence that the Navy

would survey Culebrans asking wheth

they really want the Navy to leave,

These developments,

we think under-

line the validity of the four point

made in our letter to President

Nixon on April 1:

withdraw the Navy promptly,

-indemnify the Culebrans,

-rescind Presidential Order 8684

which authorizes Navy control of

Culebra,

-review U.S. policy regarding Puert

Rico, forsaking U.S: imperial role

and encouraging legitimate aspira-

tions of Latin American peoples.

We are encouraged to see the Navy

Rub.

In Berrios

o disobey the law of the empire is to obey the

law of the country. We

ave disobeyed the law of the

empire.

We acknowledge that we have intentionally violated a Federal order

nd that we have interrupted the Navy bombardment of Puerto Rican territory

y the U.S. and allied navies.

Our action is not isolated: It is part of

patriotic movement directed

toward eliminating arbitrary and unjust fed-

ral authority over Puerto Rico, including the power of this tribunal which

omes from the Congress of the United States and not from the people of

uerto Rico.

By violating this federal order, we exercise a profound moral respon

ibility as men and a deeply-felt patriotic responsibility as Puerto

icans.

Moreover, we are announcing our intention of disobeying whatever

ederal law whose

violation we consider necessary to fufill our responsi-

ility as men and as Puerto Ricans.

From the moral point of view, as men who believe in freedom, our

udge is our own conscience. 'For us, as Jose Marti said:

"A man who con-

ents himself with obeying unjust laws and who permits men who mistreat the

ountry in which he was born to set foot there, is not an honorable man."

ecauseiwe are honorable men we are violating the order of this court.

efore the tribunal. of our conscience, an honorable man is always innocent...

From the patriotic point of view, in the republic (the U.S.) law is

rder; in the colony (Puerto Rico) law is tyranny. Order is necessary to

uman life; tyranny makes human life impossible...

From the point of view of our civilization, the disobeying or violation

•I immoral and unjust laws has its foundation in the most noble aspect of

our inheritance.

And Christ taught us that the law

ApIі1. 1971

Dear Friend,

we are a fermenting community of quakers, trying hard, as william

Sloane

Coffin urges, to become

"twice as militant and twice as nonviolent."

May we introduce ourselves to you?

You may have heard of some of our international projects. In 1967-68 we

sailed the Phoenix with medical supplies to North

vietnam.

In late 1968 we participated in a multi-national pacifist protest of

the invasion of Czechoslovakia--AQAG staff member Bob Eaton was arrested

in Budapest but freed, only to be, imprisoned in the U.S. for draft resis-

In 1969 we demonstrated at Fort Gulick in the Panama Canal Zone

against u.s. military and economic domination of Latin America.

Now we

the Culebrans in a common struggle against the u.s. Navy; the current

report is enclosed.

Imaginative direct action tactios are needed at home as well as abroad.

.In

springs 1968, a number of us were arrested on the Capital steps in Washing-

ton with Rev. Ralph Abernathy, during the Poor People's Campaign. One year

later we were back on the Capital steps, reading the names of the Vietnam

war dead. The initial AlAG team was arrested, so we reappeared the follow

ing week to resume the reading.

After möre arrests, U.S. Congressmen began

to join us in civil disobedience, helping to bring Vietnam into public

debate again.

OUR GOAL is community - on a local level, and on a world level. Our staff

representatives in Europe and our latin America actions help us to outgrow

our American skins and to build the transnational movement so badly needed

to stop the rampaging military-industrial complex.

OUR MEANS

are nonviolent -- from resistance to revolution. AlAG members

in

prison remind us to deepen as well as to broaden the movement, to be God's

revolutionaries in life

style as well as political action.

our participati

in the mass anti-war movement is colored by this concern for deepening;

we have been a center of development of training for nonviolent action,

and we are

winding

up a two-year study of the American system and how it

can be fundamentally transformed by nonviolent means.

Would you like to be in touch with us?.

If so, we hope you will return

your name and address -- and a generous check if possible.

Your sisters and brothers at AQAG

He asked BRUCE if he agreed with it, and if he didn't then

Tom opened the meeting by succating that before the Committee meets again

§its members should be dificially confirmed by the Philadelphia AFSC. Also, rom said

F the Committee Itself should now assume the responsibility for appointing new members •

Stewart brought the Committee up to date on the "Jefferson Airplane" trip to

The plane will bring about 35 Americans to Paris from March 3-10 to reet

Hand discuss with Vietnamese there the conditions for ending the war.

They will also

meet with U.S. officials there if the U.S. agrees. The pedple on the Airplane trig

will then be able to return to their communities to discuss what they have learned.

This will also be tied in to organizing around the People's Peace Ireaty.

In relation to the Committee, Stewart noted that when the AFSC office was

moved from Houston to San Antonio, the idea was that programs should only be attemp-

ted in maybe 3 cities instund of trying to work in 8 or 9. Commitees would then be

set up in 3 citi.; ind there would be no Area Committee as such; there would, how

ever, be an adv:

i; group which would be made up of people from throughout the

Area and which wouli, meet once or twice a year.

The committe agreed with Stewart that this was a good general set-up and

that plans should be made to put it into practice. Stewart noted that the

San

Antonio AFSC office was more of a "movement"-type office but that all AFSC programs

in the Area do not ha!: to be these type of programs. Specifically, there are poss-

ibilities of working in Houston with with a more liberal BEM-type constituency. Tom

ight that he would be comfortable doing this but would have to spend more time in

Houston than he is presently doing. The rest of the staff felt that if Tom

were to

do this, they could handle the San Antonio AFSC office. It was noted that Mary Jensen

was voluntarilly handling all bills at the present time.

UNDER OLD BUSINESS, It was noted that the statue of the coffee house proposal

submitted in request of funds to the AFSC Youth Affairs Division had for the moment

been turned down but that a new request would be submitted.

ALSO UNDER OLD BUSINESS, Hennacy House is running with some 15 permanent

people. All are contributing some $10-$15/month to keep the house above water

financially.

The situation in Bexar County Jall was discussed again with the Committee

approving Staff Work being done 'in this area, Stewart noted that often radival

action combined with support from the liberal establishrent-type community could

Efforts, he said, should probably be made on both fronts.

Ixa Peine reported on the War Tax Resistance Rally that was held infustin

In December and also on the protest held in front of the telephone company the

fIrst Tuesday in Februray. A War Tax Committee has been formed which will hold morthly

rallies at the phone company. People will publicly refuse to pay their telephone tax

turning the money over to

a group working to help the community in some way. (Last

month's money went to the United Farmworkers.)

John Stanford suggested the idea of a local People's Coalition for Peace

and Justice in order that all groups working for various human rights can get the

maximum of support and cooperation. John will work out a plan for implementing

the coalition.

both of these have failed, NIXON will perhaps plan to •

invade North Vietnam. The Vietnamese want peace to

rebuild their country. Once peace isobtained, North Vietnam

will continue on its socialist path, while South Vietnam

will follow neutralism.

The Vietnamese with the

support. of the Laotian

people and other socialist countries are determined to con-

tinue the fight until they have general independence and

freedom.

On Saturday, 3/6/71, Mme. BINH addressed the group

at the PRG Information Bureau

and stated she hoped the

delegation during a limited time would be able to view

their attitude and their position.

She wished to bring

about the clarification of relations between the Vietnamese

and the American people. Few nations in the world have

undergone such dreadful

trials as the Vietnamese in order

to defend freedom and human dignity. Their greatest desire

is to live treely on their own soil. She claimed the NIXON

administration with its superiority. of weapons has sown

death, destruction, and hatred on their soil.

GIs do not consider the Vietnamese as human beings and they

kill men, women, and children.

The speakers from the Laotian Student Union claim

the army

in South. Vietnam is a puppet army of the United

States.

The United States should end the war in Vietnam

and let the Vietnamese solve their own problems.

The morale of the South Vietnam and U.S. Armies

is low.

The Laotians want the Americans out of Laos.

These

speakers reviewed the history of Laos and related the plans

of invasion on Route 9 to cut the country in half and then

continue north. The United States has dropped more than

3,000 tons of bombs on Laos everyday.

The American

imperialists have tried to shame the friendship and

solidarity between the Laotians, Cambodians, and the

Vietnamese.

The patriotic forces in Laos are winning more

and more victories.

The Black Caucus of about eight members was

formed and planned to submit resolutions at the news con-

ference on Monday.

On Sunday, 3/6/71, THICK NHAT HANH, head of the

Buddhist delegation

in Paris, claimed that all warring

parties want a cease fire but they say it must be negotiated.

The Vietnamese people want an active end to the killing and

destruction.

States talks about a cease fire but only for the sake of

propaganda.

HAH stated the U.S. Government can stop this war.

and put an end

I to the killing. The American people can

exert pressure

but the pressure can only be effective if the

people

are united. He urged them to unite and form a strong

coalition. If it were in his power he would withdraw the

troops now instead of waiting for a specified date.

the group was also addressed by rather NGuren

DINh, Movement of Catholics and Service of the Nation in

Söuth Vietnam; Mae. PHAN THI THIEN TU representing the

Committee of Opposition Forces in South Vietnam; and THICK

THIEN CHAU, a Buddhist Monk.

On Sunday afternoon WILFRED BURCHETT, JACQUE

Peace

and Disarmament, addressed the group.

In the evening Mr. CHAU SENG, Ambassador from the

United Front of Cambodia, addressed the group.

On Monday, 3/8/71, the delegation held a press

conference at which ALLEN BRICK reviewed the activities of

the delegation including sessions with XUAN THUY, Mme.

well as journalists, academicians, and experts on indo-china

which included WILFRED BURCHETT, JACQUE DE CORNOY, SERGE

THION, Professor JOHN CHESNEAUX, MiSs MARY MC CARTHY (U.S.) g

and PEGGY DUFF, International Confederation for Peace and

Disarmament.

A panel of seven represented the delegation and

met with officials of the press. Although BRICK was the

spokesman, SIAN DALE, WAI Radio, Chicago, I11, was the

most outspoken and he criticized the press

for not telling

the truth to the American people.

The group was critical of DAVID BRUCE, U.S. Peace

Negotiator, for limiting the delegation to 12 whereas XUAN

THUY and Mne. BINK addressed the entire group.

Also, the

use of tape recorders was not permitted at meeting with

BRUCE although PRG and DRV permitted their use.

MxS. ALLIDES CHRISTOPHER,. Camden, N.J., stated the •

Afro-Anericans have

fought exploitation and oppression for

more than 350 years.

Because of their historical back-

ground they initimately identify themselves with the

struggle for self-determination in which the Vietnamese

people are now fighting.

They fully understand the racist

nature of the war in Indo-China as well as

death and degrad-

ation imperialism brings.

As long as America wastes her

economic, technology, and human resources for the destruc-

tion abroad she cannot meet her demands at home. As long

as the Indo-Chinese or any society in the human race is

subjected to American oppression, we will not be free.

Ambassador BRUCE met with delegation and Ambassador

PHAM DANG LAM Of South Vietnam met with group.

LAM asked

American help and assured them U.S. assistance is needed.

South Vietnam has exerted efforts to make certain U.S.

soldiers can return homebut this would be only if Hanoi

withdraws its troops

from South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia

as troops of aggression.

The communists claim they want a

political settlement which begins with the overthrow of the

elected government of South Vietnam.

A settlement by the

communists would not settle the problem

as the people would

live under a forced rule. .

In his own view peace is nearer than most people

think. Films depicted progress in South Vietnam.

Those who met with Ambassador BRUCE reported back

to their respective groups on what transpired. BRUCS

reportedly stated a date of complete withdrawal could not

be set.

It would run the risk of not having a fruitful

negotiation.

The South Vietnam government is legal, it

exists.

XUAN THUY is a propagandist and the Viet Cong have

no power. BRUCE would not admit Saigon is a puppet govern-

ment and he did not believe the POW

problem would be

settled if a withdrawal date were set.

BRUCE also reportedly stated that Mme. BINH has

no official status.

The delegates attempted to discuss

Vietnamese

history with him but he refused.

The delgation

claims he is not aware of their history and does not care.

Mr. MILLER of the U.S. Embassy, Paris, France,

explained the negotiation picture of the United

States.

The United States made proposals for a peaceful negotiation

and the North Vietnamese turned them down the very same day

and even objected to discussing them. North Vietnam wants

the United States out of Vietnam by June 30th.

The North Vietnamese refused to talk directly to

the Saigon Government. The South Vietnamese refused to

negotiate with the PRG.

The war continues in Indo-China

solely because Hanoi desires it.

A question-and-answer session

followed.

The participants boarded buses at 6:00 a.I.,

traveled from Paris to Luxemburg, and departed Luxemburg

and arrived in New York about 1:30

p.M., Wednesday, 3/10/71. Some participants planned to con-

tact their respective senators and congressmen in Washington,

D.C.

There are no definite plans for future action but

they were urged to bring pressure to bear on Federal law-

makers, state and local officials, and have them urge

From:

Marise Pols

!л.

The Citlzens Confrrence on Ending the War in Indochina will as wo all hope

nave an impact upon the thinking of the people in the towns and citles aross

the United States from which the participants come. In that sense your will-

ingness to açcept speaking engagements and/or radio and television and news-

paper interviews will be very valuable.

The following suggestions"night be helpful in this regard.

1) The trip will be flrst announced in a

news relcase sont to major

newspapers, radio stations, etc. across the U.j. for release on

Sunday, February 21, it the same time the contact person in your area will

be sending coples of the release to local reporters, etc. You lay possibly

• hear from members of the medla between February 21 and your departure. It

is important that the midla will get the names of the sponsoring oiganiza-

tions, the dates of the flight, etc. You might also want to express your

• expectations of the conference as an individual. You may also be asked to

make appointments for talks and interviews on your icturn.

2) It would be a good idea if the group would choose its own spokesman

to handle media contacts as well as a spokesman for a national press

conforence. to be held, the day after arrival back in the States.

3)

another possibility is to schedule a brief news conference in co-

operation with others from your area upon your return in your home-

town.

4)

In case the group has arrived at some joint statemint for the press,

FOR ROTEASE SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 19%1

One hundred and seventy Americans from 1l states will Jeave Cron New York's

Kennedy Airport on March 3 for a wook-long conference with principals in tic

Paris talks and others.. Their objective is finding out what the requisites for

peace in Southeast Asia really are.

The Citizéns Conference on Inding the War in Indochina, as the project is

called, is sponsored by the American Friends Service Connittee (AFSC), Clergy

and Laymen Concerned (CALC) and the Fellowship of Reconciliation (HOR).

"The conference will afford a large number of American citizens access to

and thoughtful discussion with many persons long familiar with the Indochina

struggle," explained Stewart Meacham, peace education secretary of the ArSC.

"We hope that upon their return to the United States, the participants will be

new and creative interpreters, in their respective communities, of what they

understand the requisites of peace to really be."

Participants expect to meet with representatives of the Provisional Revolu

tionary Govemment of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG, formerly the National

Liberation Front), the Democratic Republic of Victnam (North Vietnan), the

Republic of Vietnam (Saigon) and the U.S. Delegation.

Meetings are also being arranged with representatives of the National

United Front of Cambodia, the laotian Student Union and various indopendent

Gould Vietnimode groups opposed to the war (including Buddhioto, Calholies,

studento dad croupo supporting dissident members of the Gaigon Administration's

Mational Assembly.)

to meeting with official coverment representalives at the peace talks "we are

anxious to learn a crcat deal more about the recent upsurge of civilian resist

understanding of what the Vietnanese people themacives are struagling for."

The Rev. Richard remander, director of CAle, indicalid that "the concurchee

will come at an extremoly propitious moment given the United Stales second in-

vasion of a sovereign country (Laos) in less than eleven months. Mr. Melvin

Laird," the clergyman continued, "has told us that the invasion of laos doesn't

represent a widening of the war--we are interested to sce what both Asians and

Europeans see in this new move."

1917 to offer young men an altemative to military service. Today, its 600

staff are engagod in peace caucation, refugoo relicf, tocnical aid to dovel-

STUDENTS FOR A DENOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society, commonly

known as SDS, came into existence ai a founding convention

held during June, "1962, at Port Huron, richigan. From an

initial posture of "yarticipatory democracy," Marxist-

leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant

during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create

a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement

in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position

to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking

the oppressed peoples of Asia, irica and Latin America

with thể

'black liberation movement in the United States.

All major factionsewithin SbS embrace Marxism-Leninism

and identify

internationally with China, Cuba and North Vietnam

as countries leading the worldwide struggles against the

United States.

However,

the Soviet Union was regarded as

imperialist and with

the Communist Party, United States 01

America, "revisionist" in nature.

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH HOVEKENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth

Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,

froM November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it ras

decided to for a ner organization to be known as Revolutionary

Youth lovement (Rili), characterized as a niss anti-imperiallat

youth organization, said organization being proposed as

sopratc and distinct in form and content from SdS.

The

"Principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a

struggle against white supromacy and male supremacy; fights

against imperialisi, anticommunism, lascisi and oppression

of youth; and support of the right of seli-determination of

211 "oppiossed natious," also. support of the right oi

"oppressed and exploited" peoples

"to armed seli-deicnse."

it wes agreed that ryu would not be a karxisi-Leninist

organization; however, source said this was decided in order

to indicate an organization broù enough in form to be

acceptable to everyone. A temporary National Steering

Committee (WSC) made up of eighi emules and two mles was

elected to govern RYl until national officers could be

elected during the Soring of 1970.

RYu publications have listed the RYl National Ordice

(IO) aï Post Office Box 5421 and POsi Office Boz 77012 C,

both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that

the No has no ofrice space bui would probably be considered as

located at Apartnent 27, 1067 ia Avenue, Northeast, Atlanti.

Second source advised that women dominated the

lounding conference and have continued to dominate NSC

meetings to the point that

"women's liberation" has apparently

become

the Ry's principal issue - aiso that RM's poor

financial condition has resulted in its railure to publish

a paper.

During early 1970, Ryl has decided to cater to

the working class rather than youth, since the potentlal for

social revolution lies in workers.

A third source has stated that it vas decided zi

the larch, 1970, iSC noeiing that no vomen sui decided the

The term Weatherman emerged from an ideological

paper prepaiga by its leaders entitled "You Don't ñeed a

stance of Weatherman:

Marxist-reninist ii content but with

strong advocacy that action not theory would bring about

revolution in the United States. This posture was complemented

viti an international identification to the Cuban revolution

and Castro's strtoment that tho duty of a revolutionary is

to make revolution.

During October, 1969, Weatherman riots in

Chicago resulied in more

Than 260 arrests 10i non action

As Its rhetoric of vioience escalated, Weathernan

leaders increasingly discussed

FOR RELIUSE SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1971

One hundred and seventy Americans from ll states will leave from New York's

Kennedy Airport on March 3 for a week-long conference with principals in the

Paris talks and otheis.

Their objective is finding out what the requisites for

peace in Southtast hsia really are.

The Citizens Conference on Ending the War in Indochina, as the project is

called, is sponsored by the imerican Friends Service Committee (AISC), Clergy

and Laymen Concerned (CALC) and the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR).

"The conference will afford a large nunber of American citizens access to

and thougatzul discuscion with many peraons long familist with the Indochina

struggle," explained stewart leachan, peace education secretary of the AFSC.

"We hope that upon their

retum to the nited States, the participante will be

new and creative interpreters, in their respective comunities, of what they

understand the requisites of peace to really be."

Participants expect to meet with representatives of the Provisional Revolu-

tionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG, formerly the National

Liberation Front), the Democratic Republic Of Vietnam (North Vietnam), the

Republic of Vietnam (Saigon) and the U.s. Delegation.

Meetings are also being arranged with representatives of the National

United Froni of Cambodia,

the Laotian Student Union and various independent

South Vietnamese groups opposed to the war (including Iuddhists, Catholics,

students and groupe supporting diseident members of the Saigon Administration's

National Aasembly:)

to meeting with official sovernment representatives at the peace talke "ve are

ansious to learn a great deal more about the recent upsurge of civilion resist

ance to the war in the large cities of South Vietnam. We want to reach a better

understanding of what the Vietnamese people thenselves are struggling for."

The Rev. Richard Femandez, director of CALC, indicated that "the conference

will come at an extremely propitious nonent given the United States second in-

vasion of a sovereign country (Laos) in less than eleven munths. Ir. Melvin

Laird," the clergyman continued, "has told us that the invasion of Laos doesn't

represent a videning of the war--we are intorested to see what both Asians and

Europeans

see in this new move."

1917 to offer young men an alternativé to military service. Today, its 600

staff are engaged in peace education, refugee relief, technical aid to devel-

oping countries, intemational conferences and commity devalopment work in

Dear Mr. Tolson:

Attached is an invitation to a seminar that I hope you will find of special

interest.

This event is next in a program of off-the-record unpublicized

discussions for government officials sponsored by the American Friends

Service Committee for the past twenty years.

The wide range of topics, covering both foreign and domestic affairs, has

drawn the participation of many Members of Congress and senior officials in

the Executive Branch.

For your information I enclose a list of attenders

at a recent dinner seminar on poverty in the U.S.

Your personal participation in the discussion of the crisis in criminal

justice and related fields would be most welcome.

I hope your schedule will

permit your acceptance.

If, however, you cannot join us, I would appreciate

the suggestion for a substitute from among your colleagues.

we look forward to a call from your office as soon as possible.

Tomporary Office Address

112 South Sixteenth Street

Statement from Bronson P. Clark, Executive Secretary

Two representatives of the American Friends Service Committee have just

returned from Hanoi where they delivered a humanitarian shipment uf heart

surgery equipment. They are Dr. George Perera, former associate dean

of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a re-

cognized expert on hypertensinn, and John A. Sullivan, Associate Executive

Secretary of AFSC.

Our representatives brought home personal and photographic evidence of what

some of the American bombs are now doing: wrecked hospitals, schools, homes

and cultural buildings. They stood on and photographed a primary and a second-

ary dike at Nam Dinh which had been bombed with no visible military target

nearby. Whether the bombing of civilian institutions, the maiming and killing

of civilians and the damage and weakening of dikes is intentional or accidental is

academic. The critical question is whether these things are happening, and the

direct, first-hand evidence of AFSC observers is that they are.

U.S. bombardment and naval shelling of North Vietnam must be terminated. For

a technologically superior country like ours to be raining sophisticated destruction

on a rclatively defenseless, essentially peasant people who are completoly with-

out the means of the slightest attack on our country brings dishonor to American

ideals. Our representatives found in all their conversations and observations that

the North Vietnamese people, far from being driven to defeat, are uniting more

strongly under the pressure and putting their ability to adapt and survive to work

to outlast and endure the bombing.

In the name of all that is holy, in the name of spiritual values, in the very name

of America, this loathsome bombing and shelling must stop.

HANOI, July 20, 1972

Hostile planes knife through cold and silent sky.

Hearse loudspeakers signal the approach.

The sirens that I heard in London -

Another lard, another time, another pang of history —

I hear again.

Theirs is the raucous call known well to ears that have heard war before.

Who goes there overhead?

Is he

From the plains of Kansas, green slopes of Vermont,

The soft-voiced south, the uproar of New York,

The ever-greening Northwest U.S.A.?

Who up there knows what I see here?

Look: There goes the enemy:

A sweet-eyed child chubby-legged on a bike.

A mother caring anxiously for her young.

A siender girl bent over green shoots in a paddy,

A rider off his bicycle and sitting by a hole —

The single-occupancy shelter designed to beat the bomb.

Men, women, children...the enemy is everywhere?

And the targets abound.

The factories, ports, rails, homes, hospitals, dikes

That hold the salted sea from land,

Or coursing rivers that bring green life.

Or death.

Who sits underground?

I sit in concrete shelter rooms

and talk of war.

With a Vietnamese surgeon whom war has forced

To new techniques of saving lives.

An Indian of supreme dignity who

Presides over the international group

named to control the agreement of men who

Decided 18 years ago to supervise a peace that hasn't come.

An actress who knows the studios of

Paris, London, Hollywood,

Now to find, falling asleep at night,

That her pillow is wet from tears

Brought forth by sights of war and thoughts of men

Her country has sent to ride the skies on tubes of death.

Oh, Vietnam, Vietnam.

I know your gentle, slow and graceful people in the south,

And now I see here, in Hanoi, the same soft sweetness,

The same deep love of life and land.

The same people, the same clothes, the same words,

As those I know beyond the Ben Hai.

Un, Vietnam.

In the enveloping heat of July, another flush comes to my face.

How can it be? When will it stop? Who will say the word?

3*

SA 100-3119

For the information of the Bureau and receiving

offices, San Antonio, being aware of the religious nature

of the AFSC, does not conduct active investigation of the

organization.

However, the San Antonio Office of AFSC is

frequented by present and past subjects of known subversive

character; i.e., THOMAS FLOWER, San Antonio file 100-10305,

who is presently in Leavenworth Penitentiary for his anti-war

activities; THOMAS WETZLER, San Antonio file 100-12944, past

leader and organizer of the San Antonio Vietnam Veterans

Against the War (VVAW); and RITA NEUREUTHER, San Antonio

file 100-13682, who appears at the majority of San Antonio

demonstrations. All of these persons mentioned as well as

others have had access to the telephone located at the AFSC

Office in the past or have access to it now.

Tolls were obtained regarding the San Antonio

AFSC Office telephone for the purpose of complying with the

spirit of the Computerized Telephone Number File Program

and its potential in identification of the New Left

communication.

network nationwide.

The further purpose

was to determine if the telephone was actually being used

by persons in which the Bureau had an interest, or was

merely available to them.

The lead.as set forth in referenced

San Antonio letter would accomplish this end.

By utilizing good judgement in covering the lead

as set forth in referenced San Antonio letter it is felt.

this objective can be accomplished without embarrassment

to the Bureau. As will be noted the lead required only an

indices check and the forwarding of pertinent information

to San Antonio.

Bureau authority is reguested for each of the

receiving offices to accomplish the lead as

set forth in

referenced San Antonio letter.

PURPOSE:

To advise Director relative to letter of MS. Nike

Navor dated 7/22/73, which alleges surveillance by the FBi of

members of the American Friends Service Committee (ArsC) and

obtain approval for attached acknowledgement.

BACKGROUND:

Navor mentions watching a special telecast on

"surveillance" which program shows Philadelphiaas representing

a typical American city.

The AFSC is located in Philadelphia.

Navor alleges that AFSC

had been under surveillance and expressed

shock that such surveillance was so prevalent and felt that this

is injurious to the freedom of Americans. She urged the Director

to give the matter serious consideration.

As a result of the break in of the Media, Pennsylvania,

Resident Agency 3/8-9/71, an investigation was launched to

determine the perpetrators of the burglary and who was

distributing the stolen documents to the press.

individuals, some of whom were members a the AFSC, were

contacted for interview during the course of this investigation

ST-106 REC 68 /::.

AFSC, a Quaker-pacifist organization,

on, has been active

in draft resistance, the antiwar movement, and has made substantial

financial contributions to major antiwar groups and demonstrations.

They have held many antivar demonstrations in Washington and

throughout the U.s.

No active investigation has been conducted

by the FBI on the AFSC. The activities regarding demonstrations

have been followed and pertinent data disseminated to other

government agencies in the intelligence communitys

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

American Friends Service Committee

100-11392

The recent TV Program to which Navor refers is an

apparent rerun of a 60-minute program produced by CBS Reports

captioned "Under Surveillance," originally broadcast on 12/23/71.

This program focuses on the City of Philadelphia and studies

the various forms of

surveillance by law enforcement, government

and private agencies, such as wire taps, stake outs, photographing

and tape recording suspect persons, monitoring the mails and

investigations by credit companies. The FBI cases mentioned in

this program were a rehash of cases brought to public light as

a result of the surfacing of stolen FBI documents from the

Media Resident Agency burglary.

The AFSC are plaintiffs in a civil action filed in

July, 1971, in the United States District Court, Philadelphia,

in which the Attorney General, the former Director and others

are named as defendants.

In addition to the AFSC, the Philadelphia

Resistance and eighteen individuals are plaintiffs.

The complaint

alleges that the defendants through harassment, intimidation and

surveillance have unlawfully intruded on plaintiffs' right to

privacy and free speech. The matter is pending and the pretrial

proceedings have not yet been completed. There were no illegal

surveillances of any kind concerning ArSC.

Bufiles contain no information regarding Nike Navor.

RECOMMENDATION:

That attached acknowledgement letter be sent to

Nike Navor.

situations which seemed to me to be in conflict with the

facts available to me.

letter and want to assure

best to carry out our role in American government in this

Dear Mr. Kelly:

Mr. Conmy

congradulations on your appointment. With the help of God and your vast excellent Mr. Eardley

experience, may you accomplish the pursuit of freedom and justice in this often

blessed and often torn country.

Yours is one of the most difficult jobs in this

country. My silent and spoken prayers are with you.

At this point

as a concerned citizen, I would like to mention something which is

troubleing me. several nights ago I watched a special telacast on

"survailance."

I'm sure that you are aware of the program and may even have watched yourself.

==.

As you may know, the telacast chose Philadelphia as its model; representing a

typical American city. The American Friends Service Committee is located in

As a young quaker attender, with many of the predetermined suspicions

about govenmental activity that so many young people have, I wasnot surprised that the

AFSC had been under survailance. I am also not surprised, due to the many radical conceri

of Friends toady, to learn that many Friends are now personally under survailence.

I would like to point out however that Friends as a group are not interested inthe

overthrow of any government.

never heard this type of feeling voiced.

Perhaps I should point out as a point of

information as well as a personal concern that it has been often felt "that the

business of being a Quaker is to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable."

However as a non-violent religious group, we use our intelects and our souls jointly in

this endevor.

die.. t1:

What did surprise and shock me was that a type of "general survailance" seemed to be

so prevalent.

That people who had committed no particular crime and who were not

iconsidered about to commit such, were under a type of broad sweeping survailance.

Ifeel this is injurious to our freedom as Americans. And I urge you to give the matter

your serious consideration.

must often feel that they are walking a tight-rope of sorts.

On the belief that the American public too often demands of their elected and appointed

officals much more than they would ever demand of themselves, I am in this letter

committing myself to the above written moral and social beliefs. I realize fully

that this letter may have the opposite affect of which it was intended.

That if there

is not already a file on me (I doubt that there is), this letter may start one.

However, in good faith I submit this letter to your consideration.

On a recent visit to Washington to the National Archives

a Justice Department document from 1942 or 1944, came to my attention:

which would prove most useful

to my ongoing research and teaching

The document pertains to loverseas investments by

US firms in Germany, Italy and Japan'immediately prior to the

Second World War. I I believe that the document was an internal

memorandum prepared by the FBI. Unfortunately, there seems to

be no copy of this document at the Archives.

I would very much appreciate your assistance in obtaining a

copy of this document. I will gladly reimburse you for copying

and mailing costs.

It is my understanding that, although origi-

nally a confidential wartime document, this document should be

public information covered under Executive Order #11652 (Pentagon

Papers Order) and by the recently inaugurated policy of former

Secretary Richardson to declassify historical documents from this

perioa.

Thank you for your assistance.

On January 28, 1975, MY T-I made available

the following information concerning recent international

operations of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) .

The AFSC is shipping $50,000 worth of school

books to North Vietnam as an initial step in a program of aid

to the Communists. A delegation of AFSC teachers will soon

go to Hanoi following an invitation from Hanoi after

discussions there with three AFSC StafI members in August, 1974.

One of these staff members was Louis Schneider, Executive

Secretary of AFSC. The Canadian Office of AFSC sent an initial

gift of $2,500 to Hanoi and one member of the AFSC teacher's grout

travelling

, to North Vietnam will be from Canada.

Corinne johnson, AFSC Latin America Director,

returnea from a 23 day trip to Chile and other Latin American

countries in November, 1974.

AFSC in Chile works with the

Committee of Co-operation for Peace in Chile, a church group.

Scottierrick, AFSC staff member in Miami, Florida,

is scheduled to sail his boat the Mondcivitano to Cuba

sometime in March, 1975.

The AFSC is not the subject of current investigation

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

herein have furnished reliable information

in the past except where otherwise noted.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

Sirs:

They are the Nature Conservancy,

and the John Birch Society. All three are under highly emotional

attack from various elements in the community.. People are taking

sides and firm opinions

are being established. Yet facts are scarce

In a small, rural

setting, such an issue pits friend against

friend, neighbor against neighbor, and tears at the very fabric of

the community.

What guidance can you offer,

and what information can you provide

to help us to an understanding of the true nature and purpose of these

organizations?

Sincerely,

Іті
