responsibilities relative to Giancana's presence in Mexico.(f)4

NOTE: Giancana, former Chicago underworld leader, has resided

Mexico since his voluntary exile from the United States in 1966 L His

NUIP (S)

intends to make inquiry concerning the residence of GIANCANA

in Mexico and noting that GIANCANA would; certainly be subject

to deportation.

It appears to the Chicago Office-that-it is in the

'best interests of the Bureau and the Chicago Office that -.

GIANCANA remain in Mexico, or at least away from the Chicago

area.

The reason for this is that with the continued absence

of GIANCANA

from the Chicago area the vacuum created by his

absence continues in the leadership of organized crime. It

is noted that when GIANCANA was the "boss" of organized crime

in Chicago he asserted a strong and aggressive and capable

leadership which has been missing since he left the country

in 19660

In his absence the leadership of organized crime has

fallen to several individuals with ANTHONY J. ACCARDO and

PAUL RICCA furnishing a continuity spanning the reigns of

several of these leaders.

The leaders themselves have been

incarcerated due to the intensified efforts of law enforcement

as they assume their positions and ACCARDO and RICCA, being

quite elderly, are not capable or interested in furnishing an

to day leadership. u

CONI DENTIAL

CG 92-349

For these reasons the absence of GIANCANA has

left a void in the direction of organized crime which has

had a salutary effect insofarcas the Bureau is concerned. 4

However, should GIANCANA be forced out of Mexico

and should he then decide that it would be to the best interests

of organized crime to return to Chicago and resume his

leadership position, the above salutary effect would be

dissipated.

It is therefore suggested, UACB that the Legat

Mexico City make no positive effort to encourage the Mexican

Government to deport GIANCANA and that their dealings with

the Mexican Government should be conducted in such & manner

to consider the above opinion of the Chicago office
