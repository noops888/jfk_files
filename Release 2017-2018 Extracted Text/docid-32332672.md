Insert to FD-143 entitled, "JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUATION

OF TECHNICAL, OR MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE."

Since the submission of the last FD-143 on 6/26/62, informa-

tion has come to the Pittsburgh Office concerning the

possibility of the placement of a burglar alarm system,

a high anchor fence and strands of barbed wire at the

North Star Cement: Block Company. It appears that this

relates only to the rash of burglaries and equipment

thefts being experienced by, North Star and other plants

In that Immediate vicinity.

No action has been taken in

this regard as yet.

PC 622-C* was discontinued on 6/11/62, and was re-activated

on 6/29/62, after inductance and cross-talk on the lines

were eliminated. On that date, during discussion it was

learned that the North Star Cement Block Company had under-

gone a change in officer titles, and that while SEBASTIAN

JOHN LA ROCCA was still President, ALDO. PRUNER 1s now

Vice-President, ROY L. VEY 1s Treasurer,

and JOHN CONTI

15 Assistant Treasurer. If any salary adjustments are

noted in this regard a suitable time lapse will be

observed prior to the notification of the Internal. Revenue

Service at Pittsburgh, Pa.

on 7/12/62,

it was noted that JOHN LA ROCCA, the adopted

son of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, had again commenced work

as an auditor at the North Star Cement Block Company, and

that this job was to be held by him until his college term

begạn in 9/62.

It was noted on 7/27/62, that LAeROCCA had purchased a home

for this adopted son and the names of the realtor, insurance,

and banking officials involved in the transaction were

obtained.

on 8/28/62, It was

learned that the North Star Cement

Block Company owes $40,000 to an individual and $38,000

to another company, and that the company has approximately

$125,000 in accounts receivable.

It was learned that the

company is borrowing $40,000, and that company officials

are becoming disturbed at the lack of

genuine interest

shown

in relation to their financial difficulties by LA ROCCA, who

seems to be the only one making money out of the operation.
