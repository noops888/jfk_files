SUBJECT:

JOHN ROSELLI

NTI-RACKETEERING

Our Los Angeles Office has received information that John

Los

whose true identity had never been known previously, is, in

Felipe acco, a native of Italy who was brought to Boston, Massachusetts,

fact,

as a smaTT child by his immigrant parents. Roselli is the Cosa Nostra 9-/

hoodlum who was one of the principal subjects in the old moving picture

industry extortion case in which Willie Bioff was the informant and

Government witness.

Rosélli has claimed he is a native of Chicago! but his purported

birth record filed there in 1936 has been proven to be fictitious. His

important hoodlum connections have generally been with the Chicago, group

of La Cosa Nostra, although he now resides in Los Angeles and spends time

in Las Vegas where he reputedly represents Chicago gangland' sphidden

interesta In gambling casinos.

191

*1's

* The yet unverified information concerning Roselli's backgröund

has now been Furnished by an old-time member of La Cosa Nostra who was

developed as an informant under our Top Echelon Informant Program.: In a

very surreptitious manner this informant has handled the transmission of

a sum of money once each year to Roselli's mother who still resides in

Boston This Boston family background is reportedly a tightly held,

closely guarded secret.

=

The informant explains this long-time concealment of Roselli's

background as likely being caused by the fact that Roselli may be wanted

for a very serious crime committed in the Boston area in the early 1920s

as an accomplice oi a person known to the informant as Alberto Dangredo.

This individual was said to have been arrested, prosecuted and

sentenced

to life imprisonment in Massachusetts and after serving a considerable.

number of years was deported to Italy.

The informant first became

acquainted with Roselli and Dangredo in Los Angeles in the 1920s when

they were fugitives from Boston.
