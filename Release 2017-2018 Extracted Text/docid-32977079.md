Dear Walt:

Attached are copies of Exhibits 2952 and 2955

to the Warren Commission Report.

Exhibit 2952 is a

letter from

Mr. Hoover to Mr. Rankin in which he states

he contacted a representative of CIA about a message

turned over to CIA by Dr. Portell-Vila. An interview

of Dr. Portell-Vila about the contents of that message

is Exhibit 2955. It should be noted that on May 22,

1964, the CIA representative said the message was not

thought to relate to Oswald, so CIA's files on Oswald

might not contain this message. The staff has not

been able to locate any material relating to this matter

in CIA files on Oswald on the President's assassination.

Therefore, we wish to obtain a copy of the message and

all documents relating to it.

We also wish to obtain

copies of all documents relating to the May 22, 1963

contact which presumably was with Mr. Hoover or someone

else in the FBI. We suggest that if the message is not

contained in any files on Oswald or the Kennedy assassina-

tion, the files of the other individuals named in the

two exhibits should be searched.

Sincere

Bíll Bader

1. The following CIA Staff Employees, all of whom

are now retired, participated in the preparation of DIR

86054 on 30 November 1963:

Originator: Mr. Louis Armstrong

Coordinators:

Mr.

John M. Whitten

Mr. William

01

Tyng, Ms. Sue L.

Darling

Authenticator:

Mr. William B. Tyng ("'for"

Desmond FitzGerald)

Releasor: Mr.

John M. Whitten ("for" J. C. King) Ol

We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana

flight No. 465 on 22 November 1963 from Mexico City to Havana,

Cuba, was Mario MAURI who was accompanied by his wife, Maria

Antonieta MAURI.

We have been unable to determine who trans-

mitted the information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we

have not been able to locate any documents relating to this

matter in Latin America Division files or the Oswald files.

3. We have been unable to locate any documents which

would indicate that there was a response to DIR 86054 from

Mexico City.

Assuming there was no response to DIR 86054, the

originating Headquarters component should have initiated

follow-up action if a response was not received.

5.

We have been unable to find any further information

relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.
