Your request to extect misur coverage by using BTAT

at 902 South Sth Street, Philadelphis, has been considered by

the Bureau.

The proposal to moniter such coverage by using an

establishment which could be rented by PHl 523-C presents a

definite possibility of a security problen. As you know,

Ent is a highly sousitive technique and every effort must

be ande to afford it complete security.

In view of the security aspect of your request,

authority not granted to utilize RFIT coverage at 902 South

Sth Street, Philadelphia.

NOTE:

PHO has requested use of RIMT coverage at a barbershop

Located

at 902 South 8th Street.

PH reports Angelo Bruno meets

at this location with his subordinates in La Cosa Nostra on a

regular basis.

PHO has previously endeavored to obtain misur

coverage at this location, but has been unable to gaz entry

*PHO suggests that a vacant store near the barbershop could be

rented by a regular cl and monitoring could take place at this

Zoce 1on.

This would be necessary since REMT requires an

Pinterruption of the line within 1,000 feet of the instrument.

*It Is believed that the proposal of the PHO presents a definite

security problem and it is recommended that their request be

denied.

Re Philadelphia airtel 11/24/64, and Bureau airtel

12/2/64, which requested specific information Philadelphia

Division prior to Bureau granting authority to conduct a

survey to determine the feasibility of utilizing RPMI

coverage at 902 South 8th Street, Philadelphia.

It is pointed out that ANGELO BRUNO visits 902

South 8th Street almost on a dally basis.

The Underboss,

La Cosa Nostra (LCN), Philadelphia, IGNAZIO DENARO, 1s

carrying on an illicit affair wich

the daughter of

proprietor of the barber shopat 902 South 8th Street.

has been a practice of BRUNO and DENARO to have Saturday

evening meals at 902 South 8th Street, dining in the kitchen

of this address, which location would be covered if an RPMI

unit was successfully activated.

ANGELO BRUNO has met dozens

of ICN members at this address, including on a frequent basis

and all of the Capodecine of the Philadelphia Famtly Of LON

Family of LCN.

Philadelphia, through the services of PH 614-C-TE, verified

that these meetings take place.

results of these meetings through the services of PH 672-C-TE.

This intormant, as the Bureau is aware, is employed on a daily

basis as a truck driver.

On one occasion since his release

from jail in 5/64, he has met ANGELO BRUNO in this barber shop.

Since the Bureau does not deem it advisable to

monitor such a proposed installation at a parochial institution,

Philadelphia offers the following alternative:

PH 523-C 1s the former spouse of a racket figure,

DOMINICK SPARAGNO. Through this former marraige and her

activity in playing numbers and borrowing money from loan

sharks, she has become well acquainted with ANGELO BRUNO and

with many of the above-mentioned LCN members who frequent

902 Sout 8th Street. This informant has been approached in

the past in an endeavor to open a business establishment at

property adjoining 902 South 8th Street on both the south

and north side of this address. She was unable to rent the

premises, both of which are vacant.

At the present time, on

Christian Street, an estimated 300 feet from 902 South 8th

Street, there is a vacant store. It is proposed, if the

Bureau will agree, that this informant will rent this vacant

store, which would give a location within 100 wire feet of

the target address where the technical equipment could be

secured with complete security.

The informant has expressed

an interest in opening a business in which she would sell

uniforms to students attending parochial institutions in the

area. This has been suggested only as a possibility.

expense of establishing this business is estimated at $1000.

Accordingly, it is requested that the Bureau advise at the

earliest possible date if they would authorize funds to

establish this informant in business in the target area.

It is felt that the informant in this neighborhood could be

thereafter designated a top echelon source due to her

contemplated ability to furnish information re the movements

of the numberous ICN members who frequent this area.

With respect to the technical aspects of this

proposed installation, the following comments are made:

Philadelphia, through their contacts at the telephone

company, can have multiples moved to any specific location

desired. There is a multiple of the phone service at 902

would give an opportunity to interrupt the telephone

proposed target well within the 1000 feet area from the

target instrument. Accordingly, it does not appear necessary

to obtain at the

present time cable prints or block diagrams

of telephone cables in the immediate area of the target

instrument. These will not be provided UACB.

It is requested that the Bureau advise at the

Full security could be

afforded such an installation.
