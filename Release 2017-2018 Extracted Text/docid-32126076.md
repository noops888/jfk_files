"Gentlemen:

"I take the liberty of urging you to place yourselves

in contact with the Office for the Protection of the

Constitution of the German Federal Government, Office of

the Foreign Ministry in Hannover.

"On March 17, 1964, I submitted to the above office

certain data and information which should prove very

interesting also to you.

They might have a direct bearing

on the causes of the assassination of your President Kennedy.

"The indications I furnished are of great significance

Inasmuch as I believe to have dependable information to the

effect that these 'guided actions' will become particularly

Important in the near future and will undoubtedly occur.

West German agencies for a long while.

the background of that crime.

The BfVadded that BUSKE has,

in the past, frequently furnished information to various German

agencies and officials ghich information was regarded as un-

believable and the BfVexpressed the opinion that there was a

strong probability that BUSKE was attempting

through these

current reports to the BfV and the letter to the Department of

Justice to gain

some favorable treatment for himself. The Bfvs)

said that BUSKE's information pertained to alleged operations

and plans of the East German Intelligence Service which

information was regarded as fantastic and had resulted in the

BfVslisting BUSKE's name. on a warning list of persons regarded

as unreliable information peddlets SLyRET

"I am pointing it out in this connection because I

feel sure that further such actions are going to

follow.

I remember that, for instance, Treskow told

me who, incidentally, spoke a good German, that Hitler

had been a great teacher, namely to create unrest as

in Czecho-slovakia, Austria and Poland, to bring abou

dissatisfaction.

SEGRET,

The Bivl subsequently advised that it had caused a

search to be made of the records of the West German Ministry

of Justice and could locate only two letters written by BUSKE

to that Ministry these being dated September 10, 1963, and

December 12, 1963.

Both contained general statements

to the

effect that

BUSKE had valuable information and requested an

opportunity to present it.

Neither of these letters made any

reference to the assassination of President KENNEDY in any context 3)

The Bundeskriminalamt - (BKA - West German Federal SEdRET,

Criminal Police) informed that it had arranged to have BUSKE

interviewed with regard to his alleged information possibly

bearing on the assassination of President KENNEDY.

rurnished a statement dated at Stade, Germany, July 319,1964
