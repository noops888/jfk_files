the State Department's concorn regarding a nunier of the missions

reocribed in the january 1964 schedule of tie Joint Recommaissanca

Nro Johnson enuncrated the types of missions which no regarded

particularly sensitive, such as:

(a) coordinated or dual missions

sivoiving two planes in the same area at the same tire; (b) those flown

too close to Soviet territory; (c) radical changes in aitituce of planes

vailc under surveillance of Sovict radar; and (ü) other radical variations

of route.

Mr. Johnson listed 14 DOX TC? missions on which State Department

needed further study before approval would be given. These missions are

as follows: Jane, Paula, Ruby, Cliff, Alf, Eric, irvin, Frank, Dwight,.

Karl, Lloyd, Everett, Hugh, and Calvin. The Soccial Group requested a

coordinated

position on these missions as to thei- necessity and whether

thoy can be run without a significant or provocative pattern change while

under Soviet radar surveillance.

This coordinated posicion is to be

picsented to the Speciai Group at its next meeting. All other missions

in the jac forecast were approved.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of the Special Group Meeting, 9 January 1964

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone.

The Attorney General and Me. FitzGerald were present

for Items 1 and 2.

Colonel Steakley and Mr. Kiefer were present for Item 3.

1. Cuba - Consideration of Sabotage Operations.

Mr. FitzGerald requested the Special Group to approve a sabotage

operation against the petroleum refinery and storage facilities near

Santiago. The proposal was disapproved.

Another sabotage proposal was made by Mr. FitzGerald against a:

sawmill located on the north coast of Oriente Province.

The attack

is to be conducted by a commando team which will place incendiaries

and demolitions at critical locations throughout the installation.

A second

target, which may be attacked as security factors permit, is

a large floating crane which has been anchored in the area and which

appears to be used in loading ore from a near-by mine.

This operational

proposal with its two targets was approved subject to the concurrence of

higher authority. Also, it was the

consensus of the Group that the

views of higher authority should be obtained on what is desired generally

in the field of sabotage activities in Cuba.

2. Cuba - Proposed Clandestine Intelligence Operations.

The Department of the Army requested approval for two operations:

(a) the establishment of a clandestine net using the Second National

•Front of the Escambray, and (b) the infiltration of a radio operator

agent into Cuba. CLA has agreed to provide support

for both these

proposals. The two operations were approved.

Revised January Peripheral Reconnaissance Schedule.

The JRC paper dated 8 January 1964 was approved as amended.

No change was made in the following BOX TOP missions: Jane, Paula,

Ruby, Eric, Marvin, Frank, Dwight, Lloyd, Karl, Everett, and Hugh.

Operations Cliff and Alf were amended resulting in the cancellation

of Operation Cliff. Mission Calvin's track was changed permitting

it to approach the Latvian coast no closer than 25 nautical miles

rather than 20 miles as originally proposed.

Mr. McCone raised the question of the increasing number of flights

authorized by the JRC. Colonel Steakley said that the nunber of sup-

porting flights required for every reconnaissance platform was largely

responsible for the increase. He also pointed out that there is

currently a review of COMOR requirements for Cuba being prepared

to

determine whether they can be eased in order to permit a considerably

lessened operational schedule.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of the Spccial Group Meeting, 13 February 1964

PRESENT:

Nr. Bundy, Mir. Johnson, Mr. Vance, and yr. McCone.

General Maxwell D. Taylor, Mr. Triowas A. Mann, and

Mr. Desmond FitzGerald were present for Item 1.

Lt. General Marshall A. Carter was present for

Items 1 and 2.

1.

Cuba - Covert Activities.

A lengthy discussion took place on covert action potential

to weaken

the Castro regime.

The first part of the discussion

constituted an exchange of opinion of a general nature.

The following points were emphasized: Continued covert

action received support although divergence on the level of

activity was registered. There was a consensus that the present

level of operations was no longer effective in attaining the

basic objective of toppling Castro but harassment might keep

the regime off balance. There was an area of disagreement on

proofs of effectiveness of current and past measures.

Mr. Bundy summarized the dilemma by noting that the high

risk, dangerous operations are the rewarding ones and the low

noise, innocuous operations prove to be unrewarding.

MI. Mann emphasized that considerably more hoiework had

to be completed before the next OAS meeting (presently unscheduled).

Mr. Bundy indicated that a Cabinet level meeting with higher

authority would have to

be held eventually to determine how far

the United States was willing to go. Mi. Bundy turned the discussion

to the specific Department of Defense paper.

On. Sabotage, Mr. Vance stated that he could speak for

the Secretary of Defense; his attitude had turned to a harder

line.

On Harassment of Free World Shipping to Cue?, para-

graph 2.a. was considered work in progress. Or paragraph 2.b..

the attitude was negative, particularly as to siips of other

than Cuban flag.

On Covert Economic Activities, paragraph 3.a. is

part of the present program.

Paragraphs 3.b. and

are part of an overall blacklisting problem which

to be explored.

On Encouraging Dissidence Among Factions, the

consensus was to intensify these activities.

Actions against Cuban Subversion in Latin Anerica,

paragraphs 1 and 2: A good look should be taken at this

Lype of activity and a determination should be made on a

country-by-country and case-by-case basis.

On the last paragraph of the paper, it was decided

that these efforts constitute work in progress with the

exception of shipping surveillance which is under active

study by the Department of Defense. A paper on this

problem will be ready next week.

- It was understood that

this was an expression of members' opinion on types of

action but that specific operational proposals would be

submitted to the Special Group

as heretofore.

Mr. Bundy then asked Mr. Mann to prepare papers covering

the major issues of Caribbean surveillance, the blacklisting

of firms trading with Havana, covert actions, and types of

retaliation.

2 :

Review Programs

On the review programs for Japan, France, Tibet, Taiwan,

and China, it was agreed that the papers as prepared were the

most useful way to present the material to members. Mr. Vance

indicated he had a number of questions in depth but that he would

not take the time at this meeting.

Mr. McCone then directed that.

the area specialists would be made available at Mr. Vance's con-

venience to answer any questions he might have. Mr. Bundy

concluded that since a time factor was not involved, formal approval

of these papers could be made at a future meeting.

1:

Cuba - Proposed Operations during April 1964.

In discussing the proposed Cuban operations for the month of

"April 1964 and three separate papers submitted to all members for

noting, the following conclusions were reached: The five infiltra-

tion/exfiltration operations were approved as were the five caching

operations:

However, the five sabotage proposals were tabled.

Referring to the paper entitled, "Status of Sabotage and Raiding

Capability against Cuba," Mr. FitzGerald emphasized the economic and

morale aspects of maintaining this potential and the influences of

deterioration when it remains in stand-by status.. Mr. Bundy then

stated that the time was overdue for submitting to higher authority

the entire question of covert operations against Cuba. The problem

of autonomous exile groups and their potential for conducting oper-

ations on their own and the momentum of these groups even if support

should be cut off was also discussed. It was clear that the groups

headed by Artime and Ray constitute a considerable threat.

Mr. Bundy indicated that next week he would call a meeting with

higher authority and the Secretaries of Defense and State. Mr.

FitzGerald would outline the current status of operations against

Cuba, and it was hoped that definite policy lines could be determined

future covert activity against Castro.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT:

Overflight of Cuba on 1 May

1. Although it may, in fact, have little substance, the thought occurs

that if Castro is seriously considering a "shoot-down" of a U-2, from

a propaganda standpoint he could not select a better time than l May,

the traditional Communist holiday, and more significantly the Fourth

'Anniversary of the "infamous" Francis Gary Powers incident.

2. From a psychological viewpoint, identification of a new U-2

shoot-down with that incident on May Day four years ago might have

considerable appeal to Fidel and might conceivably influence his judg-

ment in reaching a determination to take such action.

3. Recognizing that this association is rather tenuous, it might

still be worth considering a stand-down of U-2 overflights on that one

day. This would not seriously impair our intelligence effort and it

would deprive Castro of the opportunity to exploit this rather unique

circumstance should he have any inclination to do so. OK?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of the Meeting of the 303 Committee, 18 June 1964

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. McCone, Mr. Vance, Mr. Johnson.

Mr. Mann and Mr. FitzGerald were also present.

A general discussion was held on problems arising from increased

activities on the part of organized Cuban emigre groups, independent

adventurers, purported plots to assassinate Castro and the general edginess

and instability on the island.

None of those present appeared to feel that it was either realistic or

practical to sever connections with or to withdraw support from the two

principal emigre organizations, those of Artime and Ray.

The recent escapades and overall capabilities of Manolo Ray were

deplored but it was agreed first: that steps should be taken to get the Puerto

Rican authorities to release his ship; second: that he should be promptly

advised in accordance with the stated policy established by the late President

himself a new base of operations; third: no monies would be forthcoming,

specifically a requested $25, 000, until point two above has been accomplished.

No help was to be offered in finding Ray a new Caribbean base. Mr. Mann

was particularly interested that Ray not be encouraged to transfer to the

Dominican Republic because of the fragility of the regime.

The next subject discussed was the recent visit of Major Oliva to both

the Attorney General and Assistant Secretary Mann. It was pointed out that

Oliva is both a zealot and a man of integrity and that his only interest in life

is leading a return to his homeland. Any attempts to put Oliva into business

would be expensive and undesirable at this time. It was decided that

Mr. Bundy would ask the Attorney General if he would be willing to dampen

Oliva's ardor.

The activities of Artime frum Nicaragua were discussed next. Alexis

Johnson pointed out that Artime raids could conceivably provoke Castro into

utilizing Cuban SAM sites; he said this possibility should not be discounted.

But it was also pointed out that Artime's recent sugar mill raid succeeded

in leading Castro to mobilize many persons involved in important sugar

harvesting and thus constituted a successful economic warfare byproduct.

It was estimated that Artime's schedule of one operation per month was

overly optimistic; one every three months was about all Artime could

accomplish. The decision was to drive home to Artime that his greatest

value was not in hazardous hit-and-run actions but in his survival as a

continuing psychological threat in being.

Mr. FitzGerald, in discussing the current situation in Cuba, stated that

he believed the regime was in considerable difficulty. There has been a

large increase in the number of executions and mass arrests. He also cited

the fact that an entire CIA Pinar del Rio net has been rolled up by Castro's

security forces and the key man executed. The sugar and crop prospects

were not good, the world price having dropped. Some of the members were

surprised at this picture and stated it did not seem to conform to the daily

bulletins. Mr. McCone said that he would ask for a SNIE on the current

situation in Castro Cuba.

A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve the underworld

to assassinate certain Cuban leaders.

Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical

of the reported plots and stated that he would like to go into the matter further.

Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was being put on

notice and should do everything in its power to ascertain promptly the veracity

of the reports and then undertake prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy

would call the matter to the Attorney General's attention as a matter of law

enforcement
