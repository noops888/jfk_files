was traveling with an unknown male and that they were on

their way to Japan and Hong Kong, and according to ROSELLI,

TRAFFICANTE suggested that ROSELLI "take over" LCN leader-

ship for the entire state of California, as the present

families were ineffectual.

has stated that when SANTO returned to Tampa on Jan. 23-24;

he spent the next several days at the house, suffering

from the flu and did not leave the house until Tuesday,

Jan. 30; when he and Mrs. TRAFFICANTE left

indicating

would be gone for several days.

TP 120-C stated. that TRAFFICANTE's daughter,

MARY JO, and her husband, AUGIE, left Tampa, Thursday,

Jan., 11;

residence and that, apparently the original plans were for

Mrs. TRAFFICANTE to be off on a trip with SANTO, while MARY

JO and her husband were in the Miami area.

Informant

mentioned that, during the time Mrs. TRAFFICANTE was in

Tampa while the rest of the family were away, she spent

much of the time crying and seemed to be in a very depressed

state of mind. ' Informant stated that SANTO's brother, SAM's,

wife, ELSIE, came to the house on several occasions to

talk with Mrs. TRAFFICANTE over some family problem and that

on, at least one such occasion, SAM's wife had been accompanied

by JIMMY LONGO's wife.

On 2-10-68, TP 120-C advised that TRAFFICANTE

returned to Tampa on

2-5-68, in the evening and remained

in Tampa until 2-8-68.
