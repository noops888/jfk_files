FRENTE DEMOCRATICO REVOLUCIONARIO

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

DA ab-(25214

A confidential informant who visited the Frente

Democratico Revolucionario (FRD) offices in Miami to talk with

Tony Varona, Co-ordinator, FRD, stated he was advised at the

FRD that because of other business Varona was unable to talk

to him. As a result he was referred to other officials of

the FRD namely, Oscar Diaz, Tomas Cabanas,

Santiago Diaz,

(First Name Unknown) Santana, and others.

Source indicated that during his conversation with

the above individuals, he was advised generally that the FRD

was fighting to free Cuba and that there was a move on by the

FRD to join all front groups fighting. for the same cause to

form a united front under the FRD.

X(U)

No mention was made to source as to what he could do

to help the FRD or the exact nature of Varona's purpose in

requesting him to come to Miami.

Source expressed himself as

being very disallusioned over the attitude of indifference

of those he talked to at the FRD. He indicated they gave him

the impression of being satisfied with the present situation

in Cuba, not that they were in favor of Castro or his activities,

but that they were presently receiving salaries from the FRD,

their economic status was better than most Cubans in the United

states, and they desired no chande. f (2)

Source claimed he had subsequently talked to numerous

individuals in the Miami area and all generally expressed to him

their dissatisfaction with the inactivity of the FRD.

Source

stated that it was his understanding that the Central Intelligence

Agency was seeking to unite the Cuban political front in the

United States against Castro. He stated that this was apparently

the main cause of difficulty between the various Cuban anti-

Castro

groups.

Source explained this by saying that each group
