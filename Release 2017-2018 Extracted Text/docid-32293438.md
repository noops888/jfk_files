TP 92-new

San Juan requested Miami and Tampa review files and

advise if there were any present connections, legal or illegal,

between LEAL and SANTO TRAFFICANTE.

In view of the above, a review of the Tampa file was

made and the following is set forth, noting Miami is

being

considered Office of Origin, and it appears San Juan should

conduct investigation to determine LEAL's activities in San

Juan,

establishing whether he is operating legally or illegally

for himself or

fronting for someone else.

TP 8-C, who has furnished reliable information in the

past and who is presently furnishing his services to the Las

Vegas Division, advised on October 19, 1961 that through sources

familiar with Cuban activities in

Miami, OTTO SIRGO, a Cuban

actor described as a

"drug addict" and who was involved in

narcotics traffic in Cuba, as well as RENE CABELL, a Cuban singer,

were in the Miami area at such time and that their names were

linked with EUGENIO LEAL, who was described as formerly operat-

ing the Montmarte Night Club and Casino in Havana, Cuba. Source

said that if these two individuals were in Miami, LEAL in all

probability was too.

MM 492-S advised at Miami, Florida on 1/25/62 that

SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR. was in contact with EUGENIO LEAL, a

LEAL, according to source was a

close friend and associate of SANTO TRAFFICANTE in Cuba and

also the source was close to LEAL.

HERBERT WALL, Miami attorney (protect identity) on

recontact May 16, 1963 in Miami, Fla., confidentially advised

the identity of his clients who had leased the "Orange Sun"

a cruise ship then running from Miami to Bimind for gambling

purposes, were AVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL and EUGENIO LEAL.

EUGENIO LEAL POGO was interviewed in the Spanish

language inasmuch as he does

not speak English, on June 7, 1963
