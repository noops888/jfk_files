1.

that the Minister Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban Embassy in

Kingston, Jamaica addressed the regular monthly meeting of the

Communist Party of Cuba members assigned to Jamaica on 24 Sep-

tember 1977.

The MC said, among other things, that Cuban exiles

such

as FNU DIAZ LAN and

others had been involved in the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy: The MC did not

further elaborate.

2. Latin America Division believes that the basis for

the MC's statement was, probably, an article which appeared in

the New York Daily News on 20 September 1977. This article,

which is attached, quoted Maritza LORENZ as saying she, Orlando

bUsch, Frank STURGIS, Pedro DIAZ Lanz, two unnamed

2 as unani

Cuban exile

brothers and Lee Harvey OSWALD formed

an assassination squad

which went to Dallas to assassinate President Kennedy. We Know

of no information in Agency files to substantiate that state-

ment.

We have asked Station

We will prepare memoranda for the FBI, the Inspector General,

and the Office of the Legislative Counsel concerning this case

and include any additional information obtained by our Station

in Kingston.

The memorandum to the OLC will be for passage to

the House Select Committee on Assassinations.
