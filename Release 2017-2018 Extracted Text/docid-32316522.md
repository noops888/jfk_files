Re: James Riddle Hoffa

On November 8, 1961, a confidential source

who is employed by the International Brotherhood of

Teamsters (IBT) in the New York area, advised that a

"rift" has developed between James Hoffa and John

O'Rourke, International Vice-President of the Teamsters

favorable reputation with Harry‹Van Arsdale, President,

New York State American Federation of Labor-Congress of

Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and will not raid the

AFL-CIO locals in the New York area as requested by Hoffa.

This source stated that if Hoffa insists on

coolness existing between Hoffa and O'Rourke, O'Brien and

Flynn, but he advised that as he has studied

• this situation

it becomes apparent that the vice-presidents will not take

any drastic action to cause a split within the Teamsters

ranks.

He said that O'Rourke complained to him how, at

the last executive board meeting, he was seated at the

urthest end of the table and the source considers thi
