up both his business and his home after State Police rounded

up his guests and that the home was sold for $130,000 during

May, 1959, to a developer who announced plans to convert it

into a tourist attraction.

The article noted that his lingering

advised that "young JOHNNY" LA ROCCA, Younger brother of

came in from Johnstown, Pa.,

during the last

week of May, 1959, and remained for at least five or six

days.

He stated

that from his comments to him at the

apartment in which he is living on one of the nights LA ROCCA

was in Pittsburgh, he understood that one purpose of his

extended stay was

to confer with the elder LA ROCCA. He

advised that the appearance of both LA ROCCA and GABRIEL

"KELLY"

'. MANNARINO before the Senate Labor Rackets Committee

on June 11, 1959, caused quiet comment among his clientele

in the rackets, most of which concerned the status of the

GENOVESE at his lounge prior to Apalachin but that at that

time he thought that SCIANDRA was from the New York City

area.

ARTHUR "ARCHIE" NELSON during the second week in June,

1959, and that NELSON said that he would have a cocktail

lounge in his new Phoenix Motel at Monroeville, Pa.

said that unless he misunderstood NELSON, the partner of

MIKE GENOVESE told him that a small restaurant was also

in the planning stage.

The informant said he carried on

this conversation with NELSON at Conti's Restaurant in

Pittsburgh's East Liberty section where he had arrived

alone for an early breakfast at about 2:30 a.m. on a weekday

morning.

He said that NELSON also told him that he had been

in Florida but did not mention the location or purpose of

his visit.

PG T-3, who has furnished reliable informationin the past, :

advised that East Liberty and Homewood bookmakers plying

their trade in those sections of Pittsburgh are now under

constant surveillance by the younger members of the Pittsburgh

Police Department who have learned that they can collect

ve seamed that they car

$10 each for staying away from the bookies for one week.

by LA ROCCA.

The afore-mentioned informant advised that he was advised

that eight policemen demanded money at one time during the

last week of May, 1959, and that the pressure in the Homewood

area has become so increased that a small operation in which

e is interested has been lucky to net between $100 and $150°

a day. He said that it has always been his contention that

the GENOVESE-NELSON bookmaking operation will never be

disturbed by the Pittsburgh Police Department because it has
