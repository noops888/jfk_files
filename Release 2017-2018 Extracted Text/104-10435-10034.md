MEMORANDUM NO. 3

SUBJECT

: GARRISON and the Kennedy

Assassination •

REFERENCE

: CI/R&A Memorandum of 8 May 1967,

Subject as Above

1. ' :

Recently District Attorney James C. GARRISON has made

a number of spectacular charges against CIA. These charges became

more vehement after newspaper and magazine articles attacking the

GARRISON probe had been printed by The Saturday Evening Post,

Newsweek and (on 21 May 1967) the New York Times.

2.

The following are the major accusations: made by GARRISON

since 8 May 1967, the date of reference:

a.:

CIA and the FBI "cooperated in concealing facts

behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy from both

the Warren Commission and the American public. " CIA "knew

all along that the Warren Commission's report was completuly

untrue in its conclusion that Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey

Oswald acting alone." The GARRISON investigation "has turned

up mounting evidence of CIA involvement in Kennedy's death."

GARRISON asserted that CIA "duped the Commission by flooding

its members with a gush of irrelevant information to obscure the

truth." (The Washington Star, 8 May 1967.)

b.

GARRISON intended to ask "the U.S. Senate to investi-

gate" the "alleged Central Intelligence Agency 'coverup'."

GARRISON is a personal friend of Senator Russell Long of Louisiana

(Washington Post and Times Herald, 9 May 1967.)

• C.

GARRISON has told the New Orleans States-Item

that "Oswald was probably a CIA agent who worked undercover

with anti Castro Cubans while publicly demonstrating for Castro.

The . . . CIA and the FBI were aware of Oswald's connections

with anti-Castro organizations but withheld the information from

the Warren Commission. The CIA and the FBI presented the

Commission a fake picture of Oswald and withheld information

about Oswald because he and/or a Cuban companion were CIA

agents. " (UPI of 9 May 1967.)

The New Orleans Grand Jury issued a subpoena calling

on CIA to produce its photograph of Oswald and a Cuban companion

in Mexico City. (UPI, 10 May 1967.)

•e.

On 10 May Mark LANE, author of Rush to Judgment,

testified before the New Orleans Grand Jury. Upon emerging

from the jury room he identified CIA as the "powerful domestic

force" which "... participated in the original plan which, in

fact, culminated in the death"' of the President. (The New Orleans

Time-Picayune, Il May 1967. )

f.

GARRISON charged on ll May 1967 that CIA was

paying the lawyers of some persons involved in his investigation.

He named Burton KLEIN (attorney for Alvin BEAUBOEUF) and

Steven PLOTKIN (an attorney for Gordon NOVEL) as having

received CIA money. Both denied the charge. (AP, 1l May 1967.)

(Comment: No CIA record of KLEIN or PLOTKIN.)

GARRISON claimed on 12 May 1967 that Oswald's

notebook contained an entry, PO 19106, which was an encoded

version of Jack Ruby's unlisted Dallas telephone number, WH 1-5601.

On 8 May 1967 GARRISON "said that he had begun an

investigation of the activities of the CIA and the Federal Bureau

of Investigation." (The New York Times, ll May 1967. )

On 12 May GARRISON claimed that Ruby's unlisted

number also appeared in an address book belonging to Clay I.

SHAW. (AP, 12 May 1967.)

j.

On 15 May 1967 an attorney for Clay L. SHAW said

that the figure PO 19106 in Oswald's address book was a telephone

number in Russia. (The New Orleans Time-Picayune of 16 May

1967. ) (Comment: The statement is almost certainly correct,

as has been previously reported.

The prefix is believed to be in

Cyrillic, a double D, not PO. The entry is placed among others

written in Russian by Oswald in Moscow or Minsk, very

probably the former. On 23 May 1967 the FBI confirmed to

C/CI/R&A that the page had been shown to Marina Oswald, who

could throw no new light on it. An FBI expert had made a

visual re-examination of the original. On this basis he could give

only an unofficial opinion, but it was his view that all entries

on the page had been written in the same ink and at the same time.

The FBI has not given us a written report on this subject. )

k.

On 17 May 1967 GARRISON said, "We are particularly

interested in clarifying now why there is also coded in Lee

Oswald's address book the local phone number of the Central

Intelligence Agency. We have had evidence for some time that

in Dallas, Texas, Jack Ruby was working for the CIA at the same

time Lee Oswald was working for the CIA here. This means that

the ClA well knew that these two men knew each other. We also

have evidence that Lee Oswald was not the only man in Dealy

Plaza who was an employee of the CIA and now we have found the

phone number of the CIA in the front of Lee Oswald's address

book.

Since it is obvious that it is no longer possible to get truth

in any form from officials of the CIA agency (sic) in Washington,

no matter how highly placed, we are looking forward to talking to

this businessman from Irving, Texas, about some of these

coincidences.". (The New Orleans States-Item of 17 May 1963.)

On 22 May 1967 the Moscow Domestic Service and

TASS gave publicity to GARRISON's charges against CIA. The

Havana Domestic Service published on the same day a longer (two

page) account which included the following: "Five Cuban counter.

revolutionaries, acting on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency,

assassinated President John F. Kennedy on 23 November 1963,

New Orleans District Attorney James Garrison said last night. "

m.

The above itero is based upon a TV appearance on

21 May 1967 by GARRISON, who told the WWL-TV audience that

Oswald did not even touch a gun on the day of the assassination,

that the five Cuban assassins were angered by President Kennedy's

handling of the Bay of Pigs, and that CIA, which he labeled as

more powerful than the Gestapo in Nazi Germany, was withholding

its information from his office. (The Washington Post, 22 May

1967.)

n.

In the same TV speech GARRISON claimed that

CIA knew the names of the Cubans involved and that CIA had

said of Oswald, "As for the kid, well, that's just one of those

things." (Washington Daily News, 22 May 1967.)

A TASS item, in English, 29 May 1967, ran as follows:

"..: GARRISON said today over ABC that President Kennedy

- was killed not by Oswald but by a group of conspirators made up,

in particular, of former employees of the U.S. Central Intelligence

Agency. Oswald himself was not a CIA agent, but was obviously

an intelligence employee of the U.S. Government." "The CIA

concealed from the Warren Commission, 'from the American

people, and from the world the fact that its former employees were

involved in the assassination. •

•, Garrison said. The attorney

repeated his call for a congressional investigation of the CIA. "

The AC/WH/COG has replied to the CI/R&A memorandum of

26 April 1967 by providing information about a number of Cuban individuals

and groups. (The WH/COG memorandum and its attachments are included

NOVEL to get maximum publicity before picturing him on a TV

Carlos QUIROGA, (21) See Enclosure 1. There is no

Emilio SANTANA Galindo. (23) See Enclosure 1.

He was employed by CIA from December 1960 to 15 October 1963.

The recent developments concerning Alvin BEAUBOUEF merit

summarizing. Burton KLEIN, BEAUBOUEF's attorney, said on iJ

May 1967 that he had turned over to authorities in Jefferson Parish a

tape recording of an attempt by investigators working for GARRISON

to bribe BEAUBOUEF to give false testimony. BEAUBOUEF, a 21-year-

old and unemployed, was. allegedly offered a job with an airline if he

would cooperate.

The offer was reportedly made by two policemen

representing GARRISON. One of them, Lynn LOISEL, repeated and

elaborated the offer of a bribe in the presence of KLEIN, who tape

recorded the discussion without LOISEL's knowledge.

LOISEL offered

$3, 000 and an airline job. KLEIN, who no longer represents BEAU-

BOUEF, took the tape to Washington and tried to sell it to Walter SHERIDAN,

the NBC news reporter, for $5, 000.

He rejected an offer of $500, Learn-

ing of the tape, GARRISON's men called again on BEAUBOUEF, threatened

that he would be shot if he got in the way. (They had previously threatened

to make public some photographs linking BEAUBOUEF to the homosexual

David FERRIE.) They took him to the court house and frightened him

into signing a statement that he had not considered the offer of a bribe.

(also reported 7 Sept

1936 and

Matanzasy Sept 1937

1.

Subject is probably identifiable with Emilio SANTANA

Galindo,

who was recruited by JHWAVE in December 1960 as a

quide for an infiltration team.

SANTANA was paid a monthly

salary under provisions of his MOC until he vas terminated

on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the tea

became inoperable due to occupation of the target area by

Soviet technicians.

Another compelling reason for SANTANA's

ternination stemmed from his untruthful reporting concerning

certain aspects of the team operations.

2.

In an attempt to establish positive identification,

JMWAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (Miami)

Sheriff's office that an Emilio SANTANA (no matronymic)

born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a fugitive from

Louisiana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet

132287F,

based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana.

He was

arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff's

office on 2 February 1966 and was presumably sent back to

Louisiana..

At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his

address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same

address

shown on an old innigration

living in Miami.

Headquarters files indicate SANTANA is

separated from his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami address.

Since SANTANA's date of birth varies

on various documents

in his 201 file,

the variation in birth

date on his arrest sheet is not conclusive.

The fact he

did give his former address to the arresting officers

indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo.

A 1962 inmigration

form includes a photograph which could

be obtained from

JMVAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

Although JIVAVE has had no contact with SANTANA

since his termination,

in Station files

dated 23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his

employer

on an auto credit application.

Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date he first

arrived in the U.S.. However, he became the FRENTE REVOLU-

CIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (IRD) delegate in New Orleans prior

to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position

until the FRD ceased to function.

The FRD was the predecessor

of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and

supported by the Agency.

The organization was used as a

front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion.

During this period ARCACHA reported to the IRD headquarters

in Miami through a post office box in Coral Gables,

the FRD and the funds were to be channeled througl ARCACHA,

less a percentage to be retained by the FDC.

gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded

that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal gain

of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of

ARCACHA •

The investigation produced no evidence that any

individual donations were ever solicited or received and

recomended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and

books of the New Orleans Exporters Conpany be investigated

for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of

federal tas evasion, since both the president of the New

Approximately one month after the

FDC was created,

strong criticism from some prominent Cubans

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Lawrence J. LABORDE, 201-294688

On 11 May 1967 the headquarters office of the Domestic

Contacts Service telephoned the C/CI/R&A and said that Subject had

telephoned the New Orleans office of the DCS that day. Subject said that

he was an ex-CIA employee, that he feared that D.A. Jim GARRISON

would subpoena him, that he was willing to leave the U,S. to avoid a

subpoena; and that he wanted the office to tell him what to do.

2. :: A review of Subject's file has led to the hypothesis that this

visit may have been a provocation, probably engineered by GARRISON

in an atteipt to trap CIA into advising Subject to leave Louisiana.

Had such advice been given, GARRISON would have been able to buttress

his charge that CIA is attempting to obstruct the course of justice in

New Orleans.

The Miami Station requested a provisional covert security

approval for Subject.on 14 March 1961, The request was granted on

24 March 1961. (A PCSA approves contact for spotting and assessing

only.) However, a 31 March 1961 cable from Miami requested per-

mission to increase Subject's salary to $700 a month and to pay him

bonuses.

4.

A Headquarters dispatch of 23 March 1962 warned Miami

that Subject was indiscreet, drank too much, and had an unsavoury

reputation. On 20 April 1962 Miami cancelled the request for an

approval, on the grounds that Subject was a poor security risk.

Subject had no later relationship with the Agency. Subject was bitter

about his CIA contacts when terminated and made reckless threats.

5.

An FBI report of 23 May 1962 said Subject had contacted

representatives of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC, Agency-created.

and supported) in New Orleans, his home town; had offered his services;

and had said he was running a boat out of Key West, smuggling Cubans

and guns with the knowledge of CIA.

A Miami report of June 1962 said that Subject was employed

1947-1949 in Mexico by the U.S. Department of Agriculture but was

fired for excessive drinking, discharging unauthorized firearms, and

non-support of dependent children.

The New Orleans States-Item of 28 July 1962 named Subject

as the source of bitterly anti-CIA remarks in a story which praises

LABORDE as a "good family man, completely reliable", and quotes a

Cuban refugee leader as saying that CIA and FBI agents termed Subject

a man of integrity. An anti-CIA article in the Denver Post of 3 June 1962

also appears to be based on statements from LABORDE.

FBI reporting of August 1962 stated that LABORDE had duped

certain persons into buying a schooner, the Elsie Reichart, by saying

that he and a crew would operate it for Cuban operations which the

U.S. Government could not openly acknowledge but for which it would

pay handsomely.

Dr. AltOn OCHSNER, Of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard E.

ROBERTSON:

In recent years funds have been supplied by the

SCHICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY. An INCA letterhead listing all

the officers and officials has been requested from JWVAVE,

which has had some casual correspondence with the organiza.

tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO.

There is no indication of any Agency relationship

with

INCA prior to January 1965 when INCA sponsored Miss

• CASTRO's appearance in New Orleans.

At that time an Agency'

asset who functioned as Miss CASTRO's business nanager vas

involved with INCA officials in planning the New Orleans

visit where Miss CASTRO was given an avard at a dinner

sponsored by INCA.

The dinner, which was attended by civic

leaders and representatives of

all news media, took place

shortly after Miss CASTRO's defection and there was

considerable interest in her appearance.

INCA was particularly

interested since it had distributed hundreds of English

and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when

she was surfaced in Mexico.

In October 1966 INCA again

requested that Miss CASTRO

appear as a guest speaker in

major American cities in connection with

the INCA motion picture production "HITLEN IN HAVANA".

Following various reviews of the film, JMVAVE decided the

Inn would probably become controversial and it would ba

inadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the invitation.

Because of INCA's extremist political orientation, JIVAVE

has wanied to avoid any more involvement between Miss CASTRO

and INCA and the Station asset.

in his capacity is business

manager,

managed to prevent this.

There has been only

casual contacg betveen

and Edwaid BUTLER,

Executive Vice-President of INCA, since Miss CASTRO'$ 1965

New Orleans trip.

This took place recently when BUTLER was

in the area promoting the "HITLER IN HAVANA" film.

According to JMVAVE, INCA officials have never

indicated

in any way that they are aware of Agency control

and direction of Miss CASTRO or her business agent, and there

is no indication that INCA officials have had any official

contact with Agency officers...

guidance and financial support in May

The IRD was created with Agency assistansisted

1960 and

of several anti-CASTRO grOUpS.

The FRD was formed as a

political action, propaganda and military unit.

Initial

actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,

demonstrations, and trips throughout the Hemisphere to gain

support for the fight against CASTRO.

The IRD also functioned

as the front organization for recruiting the members of

the Bay of Pigs invasion force and carried out a massive

program of social assistance

to Brigade 2506 members in

training camps and their families.

Although the TRD head

quarters were based in Miami, delegates were assigned to

other areas which included New Orleans,

Louisiana, Tanpa,

Florida,

and Mexico City, to gather intelligence

and

coordinate Cuban refugee

activities.

2.

In late 1960 or early 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL (CIC)

was

formed to coordinate and direct FRD

activities and this group was headed by Agency and White

House sponsored Dr. Jose MIRO Cardona, assisted by Manuel

ARTIME and Di: Antonio VARONA.. Both the FID and the CRC:

continued to function until October 1961 when thehlD was

completely absorbed by the CRC in ordei to avoid the confusion

resulting

from duplication of personnel, activities and

funding.

The CRC also had direct access

to President

Kennedy and top White House aides.

Because of the magnitude

of the TiD and CRC operations and the Agency participation

in the activities and

funding of the groups, a large number

of JMVAVE and Headquarters were directly involved with both

FED and CRC personnel.
