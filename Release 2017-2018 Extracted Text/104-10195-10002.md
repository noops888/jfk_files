As. is normall

I subject has no supervisory duties wich

level; in point of fact, it would, in the writer's opinion, merit a solid "S",

but no tore.

Recognizing that such ratings are perforce subjective, anil

that the rating officer has a closer, almost daily experience factor,

nonecheless,

the reviewer simply does not believe that the written record of

the NOC's accomplisiments on the specific targets will support an "0"

rating at this time. Even accepting the limitations which the cover

situation imposes upon

which would correspond to theliteral definition of "o".

Ocher than this divergency, the reviever shares the laudatory comments

set forth in the narrative

He is all the things the rater has

stated and more: highly intelligent, versatile, linguistically extremely

vell qualified, and professionally experienced in his cover role.

He has

begun very well to utilize chis new cover position on the Organization's

behalf, and it is quite accurate to note that

landed this particular

plub (in terns of competition for the

cover vacancy) solely on the basis of

his own demonstrated: talents in the cover context.

In suri,

this is an crparienced, mifective

whore nui cover affordo him

an expanded natural access to a host of the Station's primary targets; he has

begun to exploit this access in a sound, logical fashion,

and the period ahead

should further document the utility of his key situation to our operational

programs.

In fairness to all concerned, it is simply too early in this new

position to attempt a definitive judgment of the depth of access which can be

derived from it.

Commenta by Chief,

Although concurring with an overall rating of "g", I consider the "g"

-ratings for specific duties nuchers one and tuo to be sonewhat high and I recommend

ig" for both.

Casasin certaialy has maintained his cover and ve anticipate

he will be able to preserve it la his new job. He has just begun to initiate

contacts with Soviet personnel of operational interest and it renains to be seen

how effectively Casagin can exploit this sicuatid

SECTION C. NARRATIVE (continued)

It has been noted in paot litess reporte that subjoct was wonk in

long-rango, operational development of a'targel. The ease and

probable guccoon of an extended development le a function of the

personalities involved. During this reporting period subject has

conducted a sustained development of an MHHARSHER despite their

ditterent ages and divergent personalities thus demonstrating

Improvement in this aros.

It some times appeara that subject'i reporting could be more

precise and more closely ttuned to BKTRUST objectives.

This le

probably the result of time limitatione, and the

officer's knowledge

of BKTRUST needs is lessened by his relative isolation.

As la normal

situation, aubject has no supervisory dutles

witn BKTRUST personnel. His cover job provided supervisory

responaibility: Subjece ne meticulous in presentation of financial

accountinge and his operational expenses are modest.

from the Organisation, his continued presence at thie Station definitely

appearo to bo warrantod for a sultelent perlod lo reach more définite

conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhal

longer perlod than shat reflested by this repore.

On balance, we are pleased that thie officer has responded so well to

greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more

iggressive elforta to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity

to the primary Stallon targete. Thie officer does bring many talente to beas

on hie operational activity: he has absolutely fluent

a solld and

expinitablo cover, and i vast rango of contacto la the local coromunity.

¡icuctiolcos, It will requiro adoltional line to explore tiese contacta in

dopth, seluct those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue

them actively either to the point al recruitmes: by another officer or elimina

ton from further development, for whatever reason:

In sum, la spite of the recognised end commendable improvement in thia

olficer's performance during the perlod under roview, the reviewer submita

that the latter grade for pectile duties& and woud more properly have

been a "P", and that the overall rating, at this polnt, would more sccurately

Do set at a level between ""' and 'S", probably closer 8o the former than
