difference with USSR fair officials, and they told him they

liked the U. S. exhibit.

They indicated that everyone in

the world knows of the achievements of the U. S. in the

mechanical field and the fact that the U. S. makes more

cars and trucks than any other country, but they know little

about U. s. cultural progress.

theless, complained about the incompleteness and the poor

maintenance of the U. S. exhibits.

He said the few mechani-

cal displays in the U. S. exhibit were not functioning, and

one display built around

a golf cart failed to have any

golf clubs in the bag on the cart.
