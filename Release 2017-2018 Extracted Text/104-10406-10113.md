MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT:

• AMMUG/1 Information on

Lee Harvey OSWALD

4 itty.

1. This memorandum ta for Information and for action.

The proposed lines of action are indicated) iz paragraph 4.

2. AMMUG/}, the Cuban Intelligence Service defector,

has produced intormation of interest to the President's

Commission on the Vissassination of President Kennedy. CI

Staff learned of AMMUG/K oa'30 April, A questionnaire was

submitted by the Staff on I May (Attachment A). Mr. Sweason,

who is handling the AMMUG/1 debriefing, provided a reply on

5 May (Attachment B).

It was clear from Mr. Swenson's

summary that AMMUG/1 had information bearing on the

OSWALD relationship with the Cuban Embassy and Cuban

intelligence personnel in Mexico City, albiet his knowledge

was not that of a direct participant in matters affecting

OSWAID. A follow up questionnaire was submitted to

AMMUG/1 on 6 May (Attachment C). Mr. Swenson's reply

was dated 8 May (Attachment D). Attention is directed

particularly to the content of paragraph two.of Attachment D.

3. We have the problem of reconciling the operational

exploitation of AMMUG/1 and satisfying the responsibilities

we have undertaken with Mt.. Rankin. AMMUG/1 is such au

operational gold mine that Mr. Swenson wants, at a maximum,

two months to work fully.. It is palpable, however, that we

must furnish to the Commission the substance of AMMUG/1's

information on OSWALD before that.

On the previous record of

our association with the Commission; particularly with Mi. Rankin,

it seems possible for the Agensy to workout an arrangement with

MI. Rankin personally, that woulditake care of their needs and ours

after a frank diacuatoo ol the equites.

4. It is recommended

Phat the DDP in person of via a

designee, preferably the former, discuss the AMMUG/1

situation on a very restricted basis with Mr. Rankin at his

earliest convenience either at the Agency or at the Commission

headquarters. Until this takes place, it is not desirable to put

anything in writing.

C. Conversations between CI Staff and

C/WH/SA/CI

When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the

specific questions prepared by CI. Stalf were posed. The answers

given by the Source were reported in Reference A.

That memorandum

which I dictated to a CI Staff stenograpber appears accurate except for

sentence #9 which should have said that the only possible "fabrication"

known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, on a

television program;. of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald.

2. On 07 and 08 May 1964 I further discussed the Oswald Case

he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I believe

that a clearer understanding of wbat he knows can be reached 11 I

record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.

Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the

Information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and

comments.

" I have no personal knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD of his

activities and I do not knoy that OSWALD was an agent of the

Direccion General de Inteligencia (DGI) or any other directorate

or department of the Cuban Government.

I first heard of OSWALD alter the assassination of President

Kennedy when news media carried the name of'OSWALD.

I can recall, one day âfter lunch when a group of officers, of

Nanuel VEGA Perez.

Manuel VEGA Perez previously had

been assigned to Mexico in the Cuban Consulate where he

was the principal intelligence afficer of the DGI.

VEGA

mentioned that OSWAjaD had gone to the Cuban Consulate

two or three ames in connection with a visa application

during the time that VEGA, w as in Mexico. I gathered,

although! do not know that VEGA made any spectic

statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen

OSWALD. I well could have reached this conclusion

because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for

the DGI, Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons

applying for a visa to go to Cuba.

This is because DGI

officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas

of agents of the DGI.

such agentston appearing at the

Consulate use a special phrase/to indicate their relationship

with the DGI.

(I do not know the párticular phrase used

in every case.

I do know that agents from El Salvador in

requesting visas always made mention of the name 'Mauricio" )

The DGI officers at a Consulate Interview visa applicants to

find out if they areagents. It the visa applicant does not use

one of the indicateg phrases; the DGI officers instead of

granting the visa immediately, tell the applicant to return in

a few days. The officer then notifies Habana and requests

authority for the visa. I cannot recall if VEGA even made the

statement that he had requested permission to issue a visa to

OSWALD,

but I feel sure that he would have done so because

VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and

this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez also would have

seen OSWALD because he worked with VEGA and also would

have screened visa applicants.

SWALD because I learned about:!/March 1964, shortly befor

because he gave me $40. 00 to, buy some shoes and

other items during my tria to Mexico.) I had

commented to HERNANDEZ that it seemed strange

that Luisa CALDERON was recetving a salary from

the DGl although she apparently did not do any work

for the Service CHARNANDEZ told me that bers was

a peculiar case and that be himself believed that she

had been recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manue PINEIRO, the Head of the DGI,

did not agree. As Nfecall, HERNANDEZ had investigated

Luisa CALDERON. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted a letter to

her by an American who signed his name as OWER (phonetic)

or something similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult a Spanish so I am not

sure of how the name mentioned by HERNANDEZ should be

spelled. It could have been "Howard" or something different.

As I understood the matter, the letter from the American

was a love letter but ifdicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relattonship between the writer and Luisa

CALDERON: a saunderstood from HaRNANDEZ that

after the interception of the letter she had been followed

and seen in the companior an American. I do not know if

this could have been OSWALD, I, myself, considered the

case of Luisa CALDERON unusual because I had known her

before she went to Mexico when she worked in the Ministry

of Exterior Commerce in the Empresa Transimport Department

where she was Secretary General of Communist Youth.

She

was transferred directly from that position to a post in Mexico

which seemed strange.

The only other person about whom you asked ine in connection

with this, whom I recall, is Sylvia DURAN and I know very

little about her.

What happened was that I was in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico on 23 Match 1964 about 1230 in the afternoon

preparing to return to Habana the sameday. I was talking to

some other Cubans including Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez and

inu BUENAVENTURA at the Cuban Embassy; a courier named

"Enio", a courier named. "Tato"; and one other Cuban whom I

cannot recall.

I recall that, after the news or the assassination of

President Kennedy reached the DI orders were issued

or all origs of there, at headquarters and in the field

to sort and package all'documents according to whethe

they were "muy gesteto"" (very secret), "secreto" (secret),

The material, once packaged,

was to be held pending further instructions. Al travel by

DGI officers and all GI pouches were suspended temporarily.

In addition,

I recall that DCI Headquarters personnel were

instructed either to remain in the DG! Headquarters offices

or to keep the DGi aware of their whereabouts so that they

could be reached immediately. I do not know the reason for

these measures but I believe it logical that they were issued

because of the possibility that the United State might take

some type of action against Cuba and the DG offices, As

nearly as I can recall. we were able to unpackage DGI files

and use them normally about the 3rd of December 1963."

3. In briel, the Source does not claim to have any significant

information concerning the assassination of President Kennedy or

about the activities of OSWALD LE the paraphrased comments of

the Source are considered to nee further clarification, I suggest that

Mr. Rocca, who is most fastliar with the details of the OSWALD

Case, talk to the Source.< whis can bevarranged at any time. Mean-

while, I shall have a questian asked in a forthcoming LCFLUTTER to

determine whether or not the Source seems to have concealed any

information on this matter.

Subject - General: Debriefing of Cuban Source

Specific:

OSWARD: Ease

The source does not have direct knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD

or his activities but was ableto provide items of interest based on

Cuban intelligence officers assigned to the Direccion General De

Inteligencia.

The information appearing below was furnished by

the source and is keyed to questions submitted.

1. Prior to October 1963, OSHAlL Viaited the Cuban Embasse

in Mexico City on two or three, occasions. Before, during and after

these visits, OSWALD was in'contact with the Direccion General De

Inteligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa CALDERON, Manuel

VEGA Perez and Rogelia RODRIGUEZ Dopez.

VECA whore Cúban intelligence pseudonym is MARCOS

is the current CubanIS chelay Mexico.

He recently has had a

tour of duty in Habana, prior to which he held the same post as

now as Cuban IS chief in Mexico.

RODRIGUEZ is a Cuban IS staff officer in Mexico.

He has

three Cuban intelligence pseudonyms, Eduardo, Casimiro and Jose

Antonio.

The precise relationship of Luisa CALDERON to the DGI is

not clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from which she

returned to Cuba early in 1964.

2. The source does not know whether or not the Cuban Services

used OSWALD in any agent capacity or other manner.

3. A. When news of the assassination of President Kennedy

reached the DGI, it caused much comment concerning the fact

OSWALD had been in the Cuban Embasy in Mexico.

In addition,

orders were issued for all headquarters and field officers of the

DGI to sort and package all documents according to whether they

were "Muy secreto" (very secret), "secreto" (secret), and

"importante" (important). The material once packaged was to be

held pending further instructions.

In addition, all travel by DGI

officers and all Dal poucas ore depended temporarily.

B. When the news that OSWÄLD was the assassin reached

the DGl, there was no immediate comment but, when Fidel CASTRO

spoke on television to deny Cuban involvement, there was considerable

comment concerning OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

At this time VEGA, who has been mentioned previously, was in Cuba

and commented to a group of DGI staff officers that OSWALD had come

to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to reguest a visa but had been refused.

VEGA did not give any details and the subject was not pursued.

4. It is not known whether information on OSWALD's visit to

the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September 1963 was relayed to any

Cuban service.

It is not known il the Cuban intelligence services had contact

with the New Orleans' Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

6. The only Molina who is recalled ig "The Hook"', the Cuban who

was convicted in New York City for the murder of a young girl during

a clash between two Cuban groups. The DGI staff officer who had been

in the United Nations in New York, SANTIESTABAN traveled to Cuba

with "The Hook" and with another Cuban named ORIHUELA and upon

arrival in Cuba tried to obtain employment for both individuals. The

names Pedro Charles and Peter have no known significance.

7. The reaction of Soviet officials in contact with the Cuban intelli-

gence services is not known.

8. Nothing is known about Soviet proposals following the news of

President Kennedy's assassination.

9. The only fabrication known is the special matter by Fidel

CASTRO previously mentioned.

10. Nothing is known about Jack RUBENSTEIN aka Jack RUBY.

11. The name Gilberto LOPEZ is not familiar but, if he visited

DGI headquarters, a photograph of him possibly could be identified.

12. OSWALD's photo was seen in the newspapers but nothing is

known about him other than what appeared in the press.

Mr. E. Hensy Knoche:

Dear Mr. Knoche:

As you know, there have been allegations that the CIA was

involved in a plan

to assassinate Fidel Castro.

For the

purposes of this letter, we will assume that these allegations

are correct, and based upon this assumption I would like to

know the answers to the following questions:

1. Did anyone with the CIA tell any member of the Warren

Conmission or any lawyer serving on the Warren Commission

staff that such plans had been underway?

If the answer is

yes, we would like to know what person or persons with the

Agency delivered said information,

to whom it was delivered,

it was delivered, what specifically was told or' said,

what documents there are to support the answers to the fore-

going questions,

and what response,'if any, was received from

he Warren Commission, If the Commission was not told about

his, why was it not told and who made the decision not t

deliver such information to the Warren Commission?

2.

There is evidence that Castro, prior to Novenber 22, 1963,

knew about the existence of such plans and the possible

in-

volvement of the U.S. Government. Did the CIA at any time prior

to the conpletion of the Warren Commission investigation have

any documents' of other information indicating that Castro may

have known about, such plans?

If the answer is yes, would you

please fashishits with copies of all such documents and details

of any such information.

he believed that although there was no doubt: that Oswald

killed Kennedy and Tippitt, nevertheless Oswald might have

been a part of a conspiracy in retaliation to possible United

States assassination attempts in Cuba.

Would you please advise

us of any information in Agency files showing whether or not

there was any communication to President Johnson of any possible

plans involving the attempted assassinations of any Cuban

leader and if the answer is yes, also give us all details

involving this matter.

Agaucy's Pesition in Dealing

ith

Commission

The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the Directos has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,

Thursday.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

The DDP wishes to have from you a short but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

= sensitive WH source.

I informed him that in your

view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the basis for detailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

review this carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing.

3. Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

anticipated, will arise, to the course of the Direstor's appear-

ance before the P

a Formal and qualitied aegado by the Doi

of any contact or association, direct or indirect,

between the Central Intelligence Agency and Lee

the tabling of an affidavit signed by the Director

and notarized. (TAB A)

b. A formal assurance by the Director that all

information in the possession of the Agency regarding

Oswald's activities and asseciations outside of the

United States has been made available to the

Commission through its staff, with which there has

been close and frequent contacts since the inception

of the Commission's activities. (TAB B)

activity, in the Soviet Union. (TAB C)

d. The DCI's suggestions for improving policy and

organization with respect to the personal security of

Agency's jurisdiction have already been suggested by

It is proposed that the Director now

make specific suggestions involving legislation which

would treat information bearing on the personal security

directly related to national security affairs in a manner

Substantive information of grave concern. to the

security of sources and methods have been developed

on both of these topics. The information and, in certain

instances, knowledge with respect to acquisition has

been made available on a highly restricted basis to

Mr. Rankin and to certain elements of his staff. It is

recommended that the DCI not respond on the record

to queries on these topics. He should suggest that all

such "technical questions" be worked out in detail through the

channels and procedures that hare functioned very well

CIA components. (TAB E)

immediately after the assassination which branded Oswald as a

the ideality themes and the timing lead

As DCI, MI. McCose welcomes this appearance before

the Commission to make a categorical and unqualified denial of

these unprincipled distortions of the historical and personal

responsibilities for what was a dastardly and heinous act.

In

witness of this, the DCI submits to the Commission an affidavit

which formalizes this statement. The affidavit is attached.

It is recommended that the DCI state concurrently with this

action that he desires to draw the Commission's attention to the

fact that the irresponsible charges that have been made, sponsored

up momentum over the past six years. We have traced the.

sponsorship of that campaign directly to individuals and com.

ponents within the Soviet police state apparatus. Their un-

scrupulous treatment of the Oswald case was neither new as a

method nor a surprise as an occurrence.

If the DCI is challenged by anyone on the Commission

about the substance or implication of his affidavit, it is recom-

mended that response be along the following lines:

incorporated in his affidavit the results of detailed

component to handle that task within the Secret Service

c. The CIA reply also noted that the Agency was

in direct touch with the Secret Service regarding the

possible utilization by that agency of our experience in

machine data processing. On the public record, it is

suggested that the DCI not repeat this detail.

In his presentation to the Commission after referring

to these earlier suggestions, the DCl should state that he desired

to take the opportunity a after a

suggestion which he has not

tabled heretofore.

The Commission's major problem has been the assessment

of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to

possible conspiratorial guidance. Because conspiracy is the

core of the problem, the DCI should point out the possibility of

legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing

recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating. There

is an analogy at close hand between the problem of developing in

advance information relating-to Presidential security and the

problem faced by the country a few years ago regarding the

clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U.S. of special

nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that

time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955

(29 Stat 365, PL.165, 84th Congress). In essence, the Act estab-

lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

the Act provided by any person, and in certain instances privileged

treatment for such persons - for example, asylum if they were

foreigners, was assured. Finally, a Reward Board was

ereated to administer the purposes of the Acte

1) The DOt should sunggenhat the Commission consider a

• recommendation for original legislative action designed to

induce individuals to furnish information bearing on Presidential

security by offering a substantial reward and preferential treatment.

The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

which would attend the implementing legislation in this matter

could represent a significant inducement even to staff officers

and personnel of secret associations and state security organs

abroad whose functions include assassination and sabotage. It

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action.

The reward would constitute additional inducement for such

individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

The suggestion does not reston the waterial elements os

rewaid and special treatment. The DCI can assure the Com-

mission that we are aware that personnel in police state apparatuses

charged with the assassination and sabotage functions have repeatedly

expressed and, in many cases, acted upon their repugnance for

There are specifiorcases in the past ten years which document

this assertione Trusted gregnnel charged with assassination

• missions have abandoned the mission even without the assurance

or the inducement which the DCI is here proposing.

In making this suggestion, the DCI may go one step further

in advising the Commission to suggest that the Commission

examine the advisability of legislation making it a Federal offense

to conspire and to kill the Chief Executive. 3) The DCI could also

indicate that the Commission might desire to suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

apiracy to kill any fedoral ofticial in the President's personal

circle of official associates directly concerned with national

security affairs. (The Agency's Legal Counsel states that

draft bills have been considered on the Hill.

Mexican and Cuban Phages of Oswald's Activity

Extensive information hasbeen made available to the

activity in Mexico City in September and October 1963. The

Commission Staff has been in detailed communication and

conversation with the Agency working levels both in head

quarters and in Mexico City. Within the past week,

significant information has been developed by CIA regarding

the relationship with Oswald of certain Cuban intelligence

personnel in Mexco City and the reaction in Havana within

the Cuban Intelligence Service to the news of the assassination

of President Kennedy. The Commission Staff is in the course

of being briefed on the Cuban aspect.

It is suggested that the DCI handle any question on the

Medcan and Cuban phases of Oswald's activity as "technical

questions" which members of the Commission can develop

from or through their owa staff with the appropriate component

BACKGROUND

I. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

Interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2.. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appéarance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER

covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular Président KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordinar

provosative fashion

(" ... KENNEDY is a cretin?"

... the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to

Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of September 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune,

on Monday: 9 September-page 7, under a three-column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.s.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba.'

be seen with new attacks.

" "But I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...'"

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

write (9 September, page A-1) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

The Evening Star of Washängton, D. C., printed the HARKER

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the

paper (9 september fast, page B-4) and reworded the content

of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-

Litical aspecto

- in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER

elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the RENNEDY

assassination.that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headquarters attention te the AP story very shortly after

the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff Itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's

request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others' - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

öf the review,

admittedly heavily using the 20-20 quality

of hindsight, may be stipulated in summary:

a.

There is no increment of credible

evidence, appiying this phrase strictly, of

soviet andVor Cuban political, intelligence

or security service involvement in the as-

sassination to what was developed and con-

sidered by the Warren Commission and its

staff. The Commission's finding that

Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of

President KENNEDY and Officer TIPPIT and đid

them in alone änd of his own determination

stands.

b. "Credible evidence" that would

upset or significantly modify this judgement

did (and does) not exist in Washington. But

such evidence could exist in Moscow and/or

Havana, whose voluntary inputs to the Warren

Commission were minimal in quantity and

quality, designed to cover up any admissions

of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD

which might be related directly or indirectly

with the assassination. Therefore, the belief

that there was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB and/or

DGI) connection with OSWALD will persist and

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected by the

language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,

the record of the beginning of OSwAlD's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a question marka

INTERCEPTED: CONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE ;

LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

18. At 1T3gwexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa"

received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest

:. news. "Luisa" jokingly replied:

"Yes, of course, I knew

it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three (she laughs], what barbarians!

...**

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination. "Iuisa" also stated that the party at

silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would

they have the party coincide with the burial. Finally she

said she tanned to move that night into the house of a

Friend.

21. Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto suggestion

of foreknowledge? This is the only item in the intercept

coverage of the Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknowledge or expectation.

22. The tenuous, enigmatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following

facts:

a. "Tuisa' was probably identical with

Luisa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban

Directorate, Cenéral of Intelligence (DGI) •

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headquarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

as the replacement of the Consul: Eusebio AZUE

(departed 19. November 1963). The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'S successor)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

c. The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

record regarding OSWALD's activity in

Mexico City.

Her testimony, however, in its

entirety was taken and presented, solely, by the

Mexican Governmental authorities. A direct

confrontation with

ber was requested by the

Warren Commission staff but rejected by the

Mexican authorities. It is from Silvia DURAN's

statements that it was learned that OSWALD

becamefengaged in a personal altercation on

27 September with Eusebio AZCUE.

d. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

alias Marcos, and his DGI assistant,

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively

identified in February

1964 by two independent

sources as engaged in the active development

and facilitation of the training of Nicaraguan

agents for the purpose of assassinating

General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, it is estab-

lished, was on post in Mexico City during

OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October

1963. He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

for Havana. It was reliably reported about

VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally

or illegally, had to pass through him first. He

took the biographical data and sent it to Cuba

for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days. 5

There-is no evidence in the OSWALD case file that

Silvia DURÁN was subjected to a systematic elicitative

interrogation that would have related her dealings with

OSWALD,

kond jor confirmed by intercept, with the data held

on the

Cab

DGI, its personalities and methods, in

Mexico City. Was it normal for a case like OSWALD's,

considering the fuss he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the

applications to be handled solely by a local employee and

a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

were not asked at the time. And there remains the more

tundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

face, could it have happened without the knowledge and

participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This

seems unlikely especially because VEGA is later fited by

a Cuban DGI defector as having stated he was aware OSWALD

made several visits to the Cuban Consulate. It is clear

CASTRO's overseas intelligence and security service could

have more in its files than was surfaced in the DURAN

relevant to reconsider

the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her

was reported by a reliable and sensitive source to have

ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the

use of the polygraph on which ALVARADO showed evidences of

deception, and by bringing ALVARADO's former Nicaraguan

security service contrât) into the case.

28.

The AIVAraDa story is a particularly acute repre-

contre of the steal the at ta vas are oe

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,

whose account did not become public until the release of

the Warren Report In October 1964, talked consistently of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate trandaction of a Negro

with red-dyed hair.

29. Elena GARRO de Paz is a mecurial,

articulate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

from

a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURANe the husband of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Comnunism,

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

31. The first reference to the GARRO story was noted in

a Mexico Station Memorandum of Record dated 12 October 1964:

"Elena GARRO [said] that she and her

daughter were invited to a party at the cuban

Embassy during the period she now finds out

that oswap was here in Mexico prior to the

assassination: She was invited by a Mexican

secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband

is a cousin of the GARRO family (Horacio DURAN].

At the party she saw three Gringos, not

drinking, not mixing and more or less just

standing around together like three bumps on a

log. They were so obviously out of pläce that

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was told that 'they were just passing

through. She claims that ón the way these

three Gringos stood out she took a good look

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was

spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos 'without a doubt' at the

party."

32. GARRO repeated her story to Mr. Charles William

THOMAS, an Embassy political officer on: 10 December 1965:

At the party

were the Cuban Consul AZCUE, General Clark FLORES,

Silvia DURAN, who she later learned was OSWALD's mistress

while he was here, Emilio CARBALLIDO and a Latin American

Negro man with red hair (emphasis added]. In November 1963

when the identity of the assassin became known, she and

her daughter went to the Cuban Embassy and

"assassins" and other insults at the staff there.? shortly

afterward, she and her daughter were visited by a friend,

in cextain particularg significantly modified her earlier

account. She also acknowledged that she and her daughter

had been anterviewed by embassy officers to whom

she claimed

they did not sive, a'very complete story because the

Embagsy

afficges did not appear to give much credence

anything they said.

34. It developed that GARRO and daughter had been

interviewed by the Legal Attache on 17 and 24 November 1964.

Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her

account to THOMAS but had not been substantiated by inquiries.

The FBI representative therefore considered the matter closed

and reaffirmed his disengagement from the matter to the CIA

Chief of Station on 27 December 1964 and to the Ambassador

on 25 February 1965.

35. The Embassy Political Officer, however, persisted in

his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of conversation,

13 July 1966, GARRO identified the place to which she had been

taken by CALVILIO as the Hotel Vermont.

(This detail checked

out affirmatively. CARRO was at the Hotel 23 - 24, 25 - 27

and 28 - 30

36. There the matter rests. CARRO's chronology of the

events she described, as having occurred in the Mexican capital

in September 1963 fever coincided with the confirmed data

of OSWALD's presence there.

Her story, however, had two

points. congrant with allegations by others regarding

OSWALD:

a.

ALVARADO's allegations regarding the

Negro with the red-dyed hair [this detail could,

however, have been gleaned from the

37. Beginning in March and amplified in

1967,

the

American Consul, Benjamin J. RUYLE, in Tampico developed a

contact with a local Mexican journalist,

Oscar CONTRERAS Lartigue, who claimed to have encountered

OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the

University of Mexico campus in September 1963.

38. In June 1969 CONTRaRAs was interviewed by a ciA

officer:

Cuba and the Cuban Embassy had densed him a

CONTRERAS and others mistrusted OSWALD because

Apart from the unsustained claims made by CONTRERAS about

his own presence at the University, there is an additional

eleuent that undermines the credibility of his account:

Rankin stated that the Commission wants to account

1n dotail;

minute by minute and hour by hour, for Oswald's

time outside the United States.

Mr. Bagloy suggested that

the narrative chronology of Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union

bey converted to chronology tabulation which would permit us

more simpleto insert added details and dates as we learned

of them a other cocumentation which we can expect to roceive

shortly.

This vas agreed.

(Note: I Instructed Mr. Higren to begin re-

casting the narrative Immediately into

this {07z.)

Mr. Rankin said that the Commission has a waist high

stack of documents and reports received fron the FBI and Secret

Service which CIA has not yet received.

These include Secret

Service Intervlews with Marina Oswald,

letters fron Lee Oswald

1n the USSE and

other material. Fe promised to send this

material to Hi. Helms shortly.

(Hoto:

We will pass appropriate parts of this

material. to DERYABIN Ios lurther analy

sis along the lines of his earlier work

Mr. Bagley agreed, pointing out that DERYABIN's comment and

speculation could be put off to the side as explanatory cou

ment on ench question,

Mr. Angleton and Mr.

Murphy thought that it would be desirable to send this paper

to the Warren Commission in advance of other CIA reports with

a menorandun informing the Commission that we would need

answers to this interin questionnaire in order to reconstruct

a detailed chronology of Oswald's time In the USSH and to

corment on his activity there.

No. Angleton reported that he had asked the Commis

sion

representatives certain questions portaining to our use

of defectors in malysing the Oswald papers:

Has the Commission formally requesting us to

have defectors analyse the material?

By wellias thought that the answer

Wto this question is yes.

However,

sr. Angleton asked for a formal

request. from

the Comission to this

effect.

The FBI. has statod that its

reports are not to be passed to

ALLADLE, which may cause sone compli

cations.

Would the Commission be prepared to assure the

radically different hypotbesis or laterpretation?

The persong present said that the

Commission would.

If a defoctos who had contributed to the analy

sis of the documents should be unwilling to appear person-

ally and formally before the Commission, would the

Comnission exercise its subpoena powers against hin?

Mr. Rankin thought that if there was

a risk involved for the defector, the

Commission would not do so.

However,

Rankin promised to get a formal answer

from the Commission on this point.

Fill the classification we put on our corres

pondence to the Commission be hozored?

The' answer was that in principle our

classification: would be honorod.
