onnection with the Agency

Memorandum of Conversation, Dan

-Rather/Les Midgley and

the DCI,

Dated 6 September 1975

ISa/5CE

LAURES

1.

The referent memorandum contains two points

which require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

of President Kennedy and that have crept up every so often

since then.

The allegations are totally

wifounded.

2. The facts

regarding

this matter are as follows:

Noyember 1963 I was instructed by

• MI. R.G. RoCOLA

my immediate superior at that time, to

make a thoroigh chec Jithin the Agency at Headquarters

to determine whether ee Harvey OSWALD had ever been

used by the Agencylor been connected with it in any

conceivable way.

He ordered me to make the checks

directly and personally to the degree possible and not

to accept statements of intermediaries.

He also ex-

plained that he was following instructions from Mr. R.

Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the warren

Commission®

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond

that which I had already obtained before (plus those

items which had been integrated into the records system

since the assassination•

There was nothing in the

records which indicated any Agency connection with

Administrative Office called the Office of Personnel

I also checked the Office of Medical

Services and found no record on OSWALD.

1. The Covert Action Staff also found no record

on him.

Finally, I also checked the records of Che

CI staff's Operational Approval Group (CI/OA) with

negative results.

My checks were completed on 4 December 1963

and I then sent a brief

of OSWALD Kad been requested by the foreign divisions

of their appropriate stations, I was told, and the

results were negative.

I recall very clearly that we were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American returning

from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by

DCD, thus having

established contact with the Agency-

The same point has now, quite understandably been made

by the two CBS newsmen.

Having some knowledge of this

subject I have personally concluded that there is valid

- reason

for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.

He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD

had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before

1957/1958.

Travel to the Soviet Union by westerners,

particularly by Americans, before that time was quite

uncommon and

we were hungry for eyewitness information in

those days.

The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end

of that decade there were so many persons travelling to

and from the SovietUnion that DCD was incapable of talk

ing to all of them

and

Therefore, a program of selectivity

specific target applicability was

instituted

light of the above

seems to me that OSWALD if he

came to DaD"@attention at all-would have easily been

bypassed because he

simply did not possess the type of

information that ped was seeking at that time.

DCD would

sure by have

used its limited manpower on travellers who

The second point in the referent memorandum

concerns the papers that were available at Headquarters

on Oswald before

day of the assassination.

there were five documents which had been

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CIA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City.

We have now found that the: photograph that was ta sen was not

that of Oswald.

We do find from our informant dom there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had.

He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wald take three

weeks.

He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there.

We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

Kartz bich

Mc. Katzenbach

who is handling it for the Departmeni-

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report

that will be released to the public, probably through the White

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be

checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned

in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of

the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc.

all of which of course we are gathering.

The aspects of the

Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned.

It is his

intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be

sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said

and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make-

Well that will be fine. Thank you

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Rocca

"Internal Memo Regarding

Agency's Position in Dealing

with Warren Commission

1. The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the Director has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM

Thur

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on tha

morning.

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a sha

but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basit issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mi. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WIl'source. I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go torthe Commission prior to the Director's appearatice unless

we have fiest had agme preliminary reaction of made sure that the

Director is fully

gware of its implications since it could well serve

ao the basin lojudetailed questioning.

The DiP stated that he would

Feview thas

carefully and made a decision

westion of timing.

Given the schedule, you wil

appren

ate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

REPRUDUGTION

PROHIBITED

The difference betyeen a Cuban and a

(of the DGI) is as frllows.

Recruitment of foreigners consists,

organizations to which they belon

the schools in Cuba where they,

pact, of agreements with the

Ats can also be recruited in

guerrilla training

Once recruited as possible ag

separated fron the others and placed

in DOI houses, there they receive

ruction as agents®

Their life is normal;

they use the cover of being scholarship students supported by the Cuban government

The Dil supplies them clothes, food, and every sort of cara, such as medical and

any other kind.

The DGI takes care of their general expanses;

Ordinarily ting an attempt is made to keep then from contact with sage anyone in

governent circles so as to avoid indiscretions.

Ary agent recruited in a foreign

courtry is brought to luba and arrangements are made so that he has no contacis

sith persons in Cuba fron his own country or any othere

Once his training is

completed, his departure fron luba is not made know to anyone attached to him

In recruitment of Cubans, an effort is nade to find those knowing the fevest

possible parsons. "II the Cuban who is recruited is employed in an office or

lactory or works

soie other place, an effort is made to have him continue his

bori so as to use his situation to provide true cover; instruction is given at

hours when he is not working.

If the agent has ary trouble after he has been

recruited, the DhI tries to help him as much as possible without breaking down

compartrentation or his covere

When he has completed his training and is sent abroad, the bll covers the ex

panses of his farily®

If a Cuban who is recruited is unemployed, it looks for

a cover adapted to his situation, and the Dhi takes care of all the expenses

the agent has, including those of his fanily if he is married. He receives bis

training in the hours adapted to his cover position.

His life, Like that of the

agent who is working, must continue normal,

just as it was before recruitment.

Cubans trained as agents,

if their depart

the country is not illegal,

leave with foreion' passports.

He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache In Mexico City dealiag with the Sylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that'

some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico.

Mr. Papich

Inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some

other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of

the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive Information which could relate to

telephone taps.

After having decided among. ourselves what further

sir. Anderson's office where we met Mir. Anderson and Rolfe

Larson. The following points were covered, with the conclus-

We asked that the exact time, rather than the

whether Oswald Immediately began

his visits to the embassies or whether he first checked in at

his hotel. The FBI agreed to do this.

could make them without actually quoting the entire trans-

or where the meaning was obscure and therefore difficult to

paraphrase, I have quoted exactly. I have noted these portions

by placing them in quotation marks.

SIlvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get

Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make

possible disposition of QJWIN:

termination of his present contract

*PROHINITED

competent,

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles

in Europe where we have very few assets.

Whether this

is of sufficient worth to continue his

services depends

on the determination of how he can be used either by

any other KUBARK in as a long term unofficia

as a long term unofficial

cover agent.

He is not being used at the present time.

He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any

operational

assignments are concerned.

c. It is recommended that the present Chief of

RABNEY

be consulted by

Headquarters for their best recommendations as to

the continued use of QWIN.

After these recommendations

are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian

stations be consulted for their possible interest in

using him.

If after these discussions a sensible

framework

for the operational use of QJWIN can be

established,

I would recommend we continue him.

I would recommend that he be terminated at the

time his present contract expires.

As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation

As soon as I had heard Oswall's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed - sonetime in

Summer 1960

with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the laydng

on of interview(s) through KUJÜMP or other suitable channels.

At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family …

were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck a

me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

the information we need, because this individual looks odd."" We were

particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on the Minsk

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers.

3. I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at

the time.

Thus,

"I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's arrival.

4. As an afterthought, I recall also that at the time I was becoming

increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered

in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "hone".

He established links between

some of these women and the KGB.

KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across..

It was partly out of curiosity to learn if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry.. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special

analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.1 Dissemination

to the Intelligence Community

E.2

Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically)

including disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file. Ad-

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's,

and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all SCI's.
