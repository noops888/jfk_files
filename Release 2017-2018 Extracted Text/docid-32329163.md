JEK Law 11(a)

T-13 stated he learned that

BAKER had purchased a

Federal gambling stamp in 1960.

Confidential Informant Dallas T-22 advised SA JOSEPH

M. MYERS on August 7, 1961 that he knew that RAYMOND Bo

BAKER

handled football cards

in 1960 and had also

handled these

same types of football cards in 1958 and 1959.

T-22 stated

that he had made telephone calls himself to JE 6-8874 and

JE 6-8183

to place bets on football games. T-22 stated that

when he made the telephone calls nearly always T. A. AVARELLO

SR. would take his bet and that if he won I. A. AVARELLO, SR.

would come to I-22's place of business to pay him off in cash

and likewise would come by I-22's place of business to pick up

the money if he lost. I-22 further stated that apparently

AVARELLO has been connected with BUSTER LOICANO for sometime

in handling the football cards.

T-22 stated another person who

was running the cards and had a number of runners working for

him was POWELL HANCOCK.

T-22 stated HANCOCK, along with HOWARD

LEE, LOICANO's brother-in-law, operated what

was known as the

central office for the football cards.

T-22 stated the operation

worked like this: The runners would put the cards into circula

tion about Monday or Tuesday before the football game was played

on the following Saturday. The runners would pick up the cards

1:*

either late Friday afternoon or early Saturday morning and would

take the football cards along with the money to the central

vuen office prior to game time. This central office, according to

T-22, was moved several times during the football season to

prevent anyone knowing where it was located. T-22 added that some

of these persons, such as HANCOCK and BAKER, had a number of

runners who operated at the large Convair Aircraft Plant which
