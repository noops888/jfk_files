SEGREE

I must tell you that I don't know anything

reliable to add. Probably there was some

approaches, some steps to study him, but it is

not known to me, but at the same time, I must

mention that we respected very highty KENNEDY

and in our mind he was the first after ROOSEVELT,

he was the first President with whom we could

deal because he was, he had a scientific

approach to any international issue and we saw

the prospects of cooperation with him and we

had very far-ranging calculations to deal with

him so we consider him that one of the most

promising man through whom we can arrange

all our relations with America.

We were very

interested in him so from judging even from.

this point of view, this is absolute nonsense

to involve such people in this affair. In our

consideration, I must tell you very, very.

frankly and it is from the highest strata of our

service that Mr. KENNEDY in our analysis, in our

conclusions, it is mentioned was killed by

representatives of a group of monopolists connected

with the south and East of the United States,

who hurted, I mean KENNEDY hurted their

interests, tried to linit their activities (a)

we don't like the statesmen

who are very often

changing their minds, their statements, and so

on and so forth. And this kind of President

was very, very important for the Soviet Union:

It was - at that time I was

in Moscow and I saw

the faces of people -I saw the people in the

streets who cried, the tears on their faces,

and the mournful music by radio. This is is

a very rare chance when such a thing are being

done, in connection with the event of some other

country. This is a unique chance, so even from

this you can see the depth of our feelings in

this respect (u)

In yourecollection; since you were in Moscow

at that time and I know what a reaction this must

have had there, was there any talk, any gossip

at all about KGB involvement with OSWALD and

particularly the 13th Department(u)

Ло, по, по:

about six or eight months or probably a year to

Let me clarify something, what we're saying

here is not necessarily that the KGB was responsible

for the assassination of President KENNEDY, but

that there was

some kind of a relationship between

the KGB and OSWALD(V)

mentioned last time - previously that I do

not exclude generally such kind of relationship

because os i illustrated, with many examples, we

are not inissing even a single chance to get - to

establish the relations with the foreigners aid

that was including visiting the soviet Union and to

try to arrange some relations with them useful for

the Sovict Union. We neves missed and we are

never missing that chances, not only in the Soviet

Union but in other countries I also mentioned je

before.

So, generally speaking, I do not exclude

that sona kind of relations took plece. i had

never an access to that files, to that correspondence

os to that documents - never. And I have never

net people to had the access to that papers as well.

So, now it is very difficult for me to

Yes, just at (the General Assembly, JI met some LS]

people, and before and after, but except the exchange

of views that she arrived New York, there was any

significant response that should be mentioned,

expecially.

Is there any concern expressed In the Mission,

In the Residentura? (S]

My feeling that there are the...neutral or

something like that, anyhow, we have no official

reaction which could be mentioned expecially here,

in this connection.

there was

nothing.

about this?

I dida't see him all these days. Because, he

prohibited to visit the Resideney during

the stay of

these two people, Mr.

MINOGRADOV and Mr

MOZSHECHKOV,

And I was

afraid to see him, because he would reprimand me

severely that I violate his order. (S

What's your personal reaction to/

SVETLANA's having

left the Soviet Union?

For me now it is very difficult to express any

special remarks about this arrival.. But, I can

understand her, because obviously she felt some

dissatisfaction after the death of her father and

she probably had some reason for this step, to leave

the Soviet Union for the United States.

Generally,

I treat her defection as a sign of her dissatisfaction

with her life in the Soviet Union.

What is your feeling about the

attitude that

the Soviet Government displayed initially when they

refused to let her marry this Indian....or when they

refused to officially sanction the marriage?

All these things is very far from my knowledge.

And, I only can give you my

" personal comments, but

as far as this question is being asked just

unexpectedly, I must think it over. So, generally

it is very difficult to say something about the

things to which you don't know, in detail. And

generally, I heard about her when she was a young

girl about 15 or 17 years old. I saw her pictures

in the newspapers and after that time I have never

seen her pictures and I have never heard anything

about her. So, I knew that there is a daughter of

STALIN living somewhere in the Soviet Union. What

was her occupation and what was her life, I didn't

know at all. And, just after her departure from India

to Rome I found out from the American press that she

was married to that Indian. I didn't know about

that before. So, that was...

Well, she considered herself married to him, but

the Soviet

authorities

never would recognize the

marriage as being a proper marriage. She was never

married...you know... under Soviet law.

So, all these things is out of my knowledge.

And, it is very difficult for me to comment...

Can you comment on why the treatment would be

different to her. Now, other people have married

Soviet citizens, have married...Soviet girls...

Officially.

Officially.

Yes.

OSWALD married

MARINA, he apparently had no

problem at all marrying MARINA. In a reasonably

short time he was able to get the permission to have

this thing registered at the Zod's (phonetic)...

everything taken care of. Why...and this has happened

in many other cases...why would they treat this

case differently. (4)

Probably that was...there was some considerations

connected with her father, probably with her previous

marriages...I don't know, because...I repeat, that

it is very difficult to comment the things that

you don't know. (2)
