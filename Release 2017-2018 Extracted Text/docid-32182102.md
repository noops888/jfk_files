Director, FBI

Legat, London (163-1033)

ANONYMOUS LETTER ADDRESSED

TO TEE PRIME MINISTER OF

GREAT BRITAIN RECHIVED IN

ENVELOP, POSTMARKED: 1/20/64,

LOS ANGELES

CALIFORNIA

2/27/64

(RUC)

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 4-19-93 8Y983 10 4T

ReBulet 2/11/64 instructing London to submit

in letterhead memorandum form the information contained

in the

anonymous letter, plus results of the FBI Laboratory

examination of same.

Also, to incorporate the information

in insert form (25 copies) for transmittal to the Dallas

Office.

Enclosed

are the letterhead memorandum and in

serts

as requested. It should be noted that Chief Inspector

BILL AILL, Special Branch, New Scotland Yard, furnishes

information to London on a strictly confidential basis

and

it is necessary to conceal his identity to preserve this

relationship; consequently, I-l in the enclosure is Chief

Inspector HILL.

London does not possess reproduction equipment

other than an Autostat machine; consequently, the inserts

are on onionskin paper made by runs of 8, 8 and 9 copies.

since Foreign Orfices do not ordinarily denote

the office file number in matters disseminated outside the

Bureau, it was believed desirable to leave the London Office

file number off of the 25 inserts for the Dallas Office.
