1. Reference forwarded a CI/R&A memorandum about NORTON

Since that date FBI reports have shown that

NCRTCN is a con man, and U.S. Air Force Medical records have re-

vealed that he was discharged lo July 1950 as a result of psychlatric

problems, having tried on two or more occasions to commit suicide.

NORTON's lies about CIA flist appeared in th Vancouver Sun

3n 5

August 1967.

2. The attached FEl report, DBB 77295, VE April 1967, concerns

SEGACT :

assassinated not by pro-Communist Lee Farvey Oswald but rather a

a result o! a right-wing conspiracy lavolving CIA.

4. The surfacing of two such allegations in or through the Vancouver

Sun seems to place a strain on colncidence. Do you kave asy information

about the use of the Sun in other surfecings of WHORDER propaganda

against CIA? Is there any Information about contacle betveen employeea of

the Sun and representatives of Soviel Intelligence? Il no such information

is at hand. it would be appreciated if these questions were forwarded to

Although Headguarters has no record of Trevor LAUTENS,

it is conceivable thal

jilles may also hold taformation about him.
