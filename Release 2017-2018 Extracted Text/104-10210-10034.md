VI. Production

A Pesitive intelligence Ipformation

NOSENKO's positive intelligence production.

has beed

meager,

and nothing he reported acrited disseminition as an

intelligonce report.

According to his biography, NOSENKO's

entire adult life until defecting had been spent

either as

& student or as an intelligence officer,

and in explanation

of bis lack of positive intelligence information, he has

stressed that since the early 1950's he had few outside

interests and "no real contacts" outside the KGB itself.*

NOSENKO's assignments to the Sovlet delegations to the

Disarmament Conference in 1962 and 1961 were, he hes said,

for cover purposes only. and he aeither had

any connections

with officials or organizations

in the USSR concerned with

arMs

control or disarmament policies

nor did he take any

part in the substantive work of the delegations.

During the period 18 to 23 February

1964, a wide range

of questions covering various aspects of nuclear

weapons,

missiles, electronics, communications, unconventional wea-

pons, military

industry, military units and equipment, and

research and development were put to MOSENKO in order to

evaluate his knowledgeability.

He had no direct knowledge

of any of these topics,

although he was able to identify in

general a few of the KGB organizations which protect sensi

tive installations such as nuclear weapons production and

storage sites.

NOSENKO was given a set of requirements

fron the Defense Intelligence Agency on 24 February 1964.

These questions were premised on his two TDY tours to the

Disarnament Conferences in Geneva; thuy dealt with such

matters as Soviet underground testing, Soviet efforts and

progress in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,

Soviet ains and purposes at the disarmament talks, and

Soviet views of the corresponding attitudes and intentions

of the United States.

NOSENKO stated he had us. information

on any

of these questions but expressed his personal opinion

on a few of them,

in general terms.

NOSENKO's answerg to

other questions of a positive intelligence nature--those

concerning the viability

of the current Soviet leadership.

plana for a new Soviet constitution, anti-Semitist as

governmental policy, personality data on Soviet lcaders,

and other political and social matters--were couched in vague

and general terms and were not based on concrete knowledge.

*At the start of his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962,

however, when explaining how he knew of the real state of

affzirs

inside the USSR

(as opposed to that presented by

Soviet propaganda), NOSENKO

said:

"I circulate among

ministers, with the friends of my father, and I bear

what they say."

C. KGB Headguarters

1. Structure and Functiong

Prior to NOSENKO's contact with CIA in June 1962, tho

most recent information on KGB structure and functiong had

been provided by GOLITSYN, whose information was current as

of December 1961 when he

defected.

GOLITSYN'g data and that

from the Polish defector GOLENIEWSKI wero the first detailed

new information on this subject available to the U.S. intel-

ligence community since 1954, when DERYABIN, RASTVOROV,

PETROV, and KHOKHLOV defected, just prior to the change-over

from the Ministry of Internal

(MVD) to the Committee

for State Security (KGB).

GOLZNIENSKI and GOLITSIN had re-

ported on the 1959 reorganization of the KGB, the first major

realignment of the KGB's functions since the

abolition of

the Committee

for Infornation in 1951.

It encompassed the

absorption into the Second Chief Directorate of the duties of

Fourth,

and Sixth Directorates. which had

been responsible for political, econonic-industrial, and

transportation security, respectively. It also included the

upgrading of the Illegals Department to the status of a

Special Directorate within the First Chief Directorate, the

consolidation

counterintelligence operations abroid into

one new department,

Fourteenth, and creation of a new

department-Department "D" (Disinformation) --to coordinate

and intensify the KGB's activities in the area of deception

and aisinformation.

The latter,

Chief Dircetorate, was established to serve the needs of the

NOSENKO's 1964 information on the organization and func-

tions of the KGB indicated refinements of responsibilities

in the Second Chief Directorate in accordance with the 1959

absorption of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Directorates.

The formation of the so-called

"Service" (Sluzhba) as a

component of tle Second

Chief Directorate centraTized those

political security functions (formerly handled by the Fourth

Directorate) which were unrelated to

foreigners in the USSR;

the creation of an element entitled "the Directorate"

accomplished the

same thing for industrial-aconomic

JunctIons formerly managed by the Fifth and Sixth Directorates.

As for the First Chief Directorate, NOSENKO reported the up-

grading of the Scientific and Technical Départment to direc

torate status, and the expansion of the Information and

Counterintelligence Departments to ¿Service: Number:]" and "Ser-

vice Number 2," respectively; according to NOSENKO,

latter organizational designation permits an increase in

personnel without a corresponding rise in the bureaucratic

level of the component.

The accompanying charts offer a comparison of the or-

ganization of the KGB in 1961,

as known from GOLITSYN (and

supported by GOLENIEWSKI),

and in 1964, as given by NOSENKO.

on particular weaknesses in NOSENKO's information .

on the KGB organization since its formation in 1954 will be

found in Part VII.B.1., Statements of DERYABIN.

2. Modus Operandi

Less measurable or precise in comparison with KG

structure and functions

are the operational nethods and

Headquarters procedures of the KCS.

SOSENKO himself has not

been

as productive in revaling Tourist Departrent sethods

as

was the document which he provided on this subject in

19640

He has not been

able to pro:ide a systematic, detailed,

or documented review of the methods of the other Second Chief

Directorate component to which ho was assigned, the u.s.

Erbassy Sectior, not of the nothods of the Surycillance

Directorate with wirich ne worked closely.

JOSESKO neverthe-

less has

furnisted insights into the L.S. Enbassy Section

and Surveillance Dirictorate nethuds in the course of dis-

cussing spicific operations.

NOSESKO brought to tni Gunera muerings

in 1964 a draft

of a report to the Colligium of th+ KGB dated March 1963 on

the work of the Tourist Department of the Second Chief Direc

torate.

written st hinself, and it bore

corrections in his handwriting.

This draft descrihed KCB

investigations of and operations against lestern tourists

suspected of being agents of forcign intelligence services,

primarily

periud of 1961-19"2.

It described the

functiors

conponent of tre lourist Department and

the number ard qualifications of the operational staff.

giving figures on length of service, educational background,

foreign travel and languages, and

training.

It went on to

cite

statistics on the number of foreign tourists visiting

the L'SSR,

the number of foreign agent susprets uncovered

among them through the

work of the KCB.

A wid. variety of

techniques used by the Tourist Departrent were mentioned,

with examples of certain successes interspersed in the

discussion.

NOSENKO has

made numerous relurences to the techniques

described in this report,

as discussed in the many

cases

reviewed in detail in tne foregoing treatment of his KGB

career.

When

interviewed for further information on the

statistics which appear throughout the 1963 draft, however,

NOSENKO was unable to identify the operations referred to in

the numerical citations, nor those included as illustrative

examples of operational techniques,

TOP SECRET

## Page 13

es airinte

The document refers also to the role of the leadership

of the Tourist Department in briefing other organs of the

KGB on work against foreign tourists.

NOSENKO was questioned

on this activity but ould

not recall

any infornation contained

in such lectures or discussions.

Although the document also

emphasized the daily need for coordination of the Tourist

Departnent activities with numerous other components of KGB

Headquarters and with local organs of the KGB throughout the

Soviet Union,

NOSE"KO was unable to explain how

such coordina

tion was effected in practice, nor could he describe require-

ments for the preparation and

approval of correspondence

pertaining to such coordination; in many instances he asserted

that telephone calls sufficed, but he said he could.not indi

cate who was authorized

to coordinate informally in this way.

this information on Tourist Department modus

operandi, NOSENKO has described the operational methods of

the V.S. Embassy Section of the Anerican Department and of

the Survcillance Directorate in connection with their coordinated

activities against Embassy targets.

Of particular note is

Part V.E.3.c., in discussions of operations against Embassy

code clerks.

3.

Staff Procedures

In recounting verious operations

in which he participated

or which he supervised, NOSENKO described operations and

events which encompassed various KGB procedures.

Some of

these were:

authorization for recruitment; file checks;

correspondence and coordination with other KGB departments,

directorates, or regional units;

technical support of opera-

tlons;

adainistration of safe houses; KGB files and reports;

and travel authorizations and accountings.

He was

from time

to time asked to describe such procedures systematically and

in detail.

From such questioning it was not possible to

derive any detailed picture of current KGB procedures.

The

little NOSFNKO was able to provide did not differ from infor-

mation dated 1954,

and was only a small fraction of the. lifor-

mation available from earlier sources.

He had no information

on changes.or developments in the interim.

Examples of the

level of NOSENKO's knowledge of certain procedures may

be

found in Part VII.B.1, DERYADIN'S Conments, as nay instances

of inaccurate reporting of procedures.

D. KGB Activities

1. Operations Against Americans

In the context of kGs recruitment operations and investigations,

NOSENKO has mentioned 11l Americans:

Forty-nine of them were said

to have been recruited,

33 were under development, and

seven re

fused to collatorate

with the KGB; investigations

remaining 22

Americans were reportedly predicated on

KGB sus.

picion or knowiedge of their affiliation with U,S. Intelligence.

Of the 49 Americans

edge of nine of them

to

recruited, #OSENKO attributed his knowl-

his

owr. direct,

personal involvement in

the approaches, usually

as recruiting officer;

these cases are

discussed at greater

length in connection with NOCENKO's KGB

career (Part.'j.

His knowledge of l! other recruitments was said

to have derived irom

either indirect involvement or contact with

the targets of these operations; NOSENKO indicated that he be-

came aware

of these l1 persons

through his duties at various times

in the America: and

Tourist Departnents of the KGB Second Chief

Directorate.

(recause of interest in Americer correspondents

during 1954

and 1955 while in the American Department, for exam-

ple, he was able to report that five of them were KGB

agents, al-

though he had taken no

part in their

recruitments, which had

been

achieved earlier; likewise,

he learned

of two recruitments when

an American Department officer twice visited the Tourist Depart-

ment with a request for operational assistance during 1962 and

1963, when NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of this department.) In

four

cases--all First Chiet Dircctorate operations--NOSENO said

he lcarned of

the recruitments unofficially

from discussions

with

friends and fron remarks by

other case officers which he

over

heard.

Two of these

four cases were considered by NOSENKO to be

the penetration of the

andy cour no crasher station or ats. Army see Robert lee JoHN-

SON and the recruitment in Moscow and later handling of code-

machine mechanic Dayle W. SMITH; detailed information on the

JOHNSON

and SWITH cases is

presented after the tabulation (below)

of NOSENKO'S American leads.

NOSENKO has provided no sources for his information on 25

of the 49 successful KGB recruitment operations against Aneri-

cans, although he has sonetimes identified the case officers in-

volved in them; most of this information was contained in handwritten

notes, which NOSENKO carried to Geneva

in 1964.

According to SOSENKO,

he learned of these cases casually while Deputy Chief of the Tour-

ist Department during 1962 and 1963; many of the recruitments were

said to have been accomplished in 1960 and 1961 at a time when

NOSENKO was serving in the American Department.

He has explained

these notes as follows:

"If I did not participate in a case. I

don't know much about it.

I first began to get ready for this act (defection), any time l

when

got a whiff of something wnich smelled like an agent,

I would put

it down.

I have a regular safe in my office and then I have a

hidden wall safe.

There I may put my personal papers, notes.

am the only one who has a key and any little notes, like those l

mentioned, I rould

put in there."

Additionally, a female KGB

The

Because JENNER refused to

do so and because he turned out to

the operation was put aside.

(1) NOSE KO's Information on the Agent

At the first meeting with ClA in 1S6 JOSESKO announced that

he could not

continue to work in place sor ClA; ne tas

going to

defect outright,

he said, ruther than so back to the Soviet

Union.

He was told that

1n

order to make the

arrangements for his

secure

removal from Switzerland

it would be necessary to expand the

limites number of people in ClA who vere arare of his case; in

this contection it was extremely important that he chink hard

about wether he krew of any indication ci penetration of clA.

His first reaction was to shrug his

had

shoulders indicating that he

his case

officer's croistence he

thought

further about the question and

finally said:

"I do not know of

any in ClA, but there 1s one in your military intellisense.

This

one worked

in Germany and then returned to America in 1955, and

then after 1955 he worked in Germany

He explained that he had

first learned of this case from M.A. SHALYAPIN,

who had been the

case officer

for tis operation in Germary.

This agent, whose

name

NOSENKO did not knoi, was still in Cermany

as of the time

SHALYAPIS lefa Berlin in about 1957.*

SHALYAPI told him that this

agent's küß cryptonym das "SASliA," and that he had recruited

"SASHA" hamself in Germany, on a purely financial basis.

Asked

if "SASHA" wore a uniform while meeting his KGB handler, NOSENKO

said he appeared in

civilian

clothes.

He knew "SASHA" was of offi-

cer status,

but whether he was in civilian or military intelligence

he could

not say; he thought,

however, the agent was

working

against military

targets

XOSENKO added that

"SASHA" returned to

the United States in

the 1960's, then specified i962, and returned

to Gernany again after that.

In February 1964, talking about another matter, NOSENKO

said he

had remembered

something that might help to identify

"SASHA." He had heard that the KGB had not had luck in getting

intelligence from high places in the U.s.

Government during the

NOSENKO:

I tell you I was not working on this case. He was

recruited in 1949-1950.

Question:

when did he leave Moscow?

NOSENKO :

He left in 1950. It seems so, yes. He said that he

would not work in the USA.

NOSENKO went on to say that "ANDREY" was the cryptonym

assigned to the agent by the Second Chief Directorate at the time

of is recruitment.

Although NOSENKO was not sure of the dates,

he was certain that this man, a U.S. Army Sergeant, had been

for the KSB by Roy RHODES, whose KGB cryptonym was

"QUEBEC".

RHODES was stili In Moscow when "ANDREY" was -e-

cruited; he had told the KGB

about many other U.S. Embassy

employees, including military personnel, and the name "ANDREY"

would mean nothing to RHODES because he

did not know that the

KGB had recruited this man.*

The mechänic worked

satisfactorily in Moscow for the KGB,

providing materials and information on ciphers.

"ANDREY" pro-

mised he would cooperate with the Soviets in future assignments

abroad, but would not work with then in

the United States as he

did not want to "sit in the electric chair."

him more but he refused to accept it because he said he couid

of a large diamord of more than a carat in the United States

could arouse the attention of the police.

left Moscow for the United States, and the KGB waited for him

to reappear in some other country, but he did not.

Finally in

1955 the KGB sent an officer, who had participated in the re-

cruitment of the agent in Moscow, to the United States for the

purpose of finding

"ANDREY" and the officer had no other

After NOSENKO's first mention of Roy RHODES' role in this

case, records were checked for the dates of RHODES' assign-

ment in Moscow, which were April 1951 to July 1953. Accord-

ing to RHODES,

the date of his own recruitment by the KGB

was January 1952.

When these dates were cited to NOSENKO

on two separate occasions during the 1962 meetings he

changed the original date for the recruitment from 1949

or 1950 to 1952 or 1953.

In 1962, as well as 1n 1964,

The association in NOSENKO's mind between "ANDREY" and

that he explained to the KGB how

Embassy worked ard on one occasion NOSETNO expressed the opinion

'ANDREY" may have given the KGB parts of

code machines such

as "discs" (sic, meaning rotorg).

In this connection, NOSENKO

recalled that one Aleksandr SELEZNSY, a deputy department chief

in the Communications Directorate of

the KGB, had been involved

in the 'ANDREY ' case:

tional meetings.

The reason for jELEZNEV's presence was that

the case officers were not technical

specialists.

and SELEZNEV

would supply them with the questions to be asked of

"ANDREY."

Since SELEZNEV came to these meetings in civilian clothes,

whereas NOSENKO normally saw him in

the First Department in 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO speculated that

SELEZEY may have gone in person to some of the mectings with

officers working with

"ANDREY" to ask him for discs from inside

NOSENKO was asked if "ANDREY" had brought military code material

operation of code machines and what daily or other periodic

settings were made...

was able to furnish good materiel, not only orally but also in

the form of documents, papers, and written material.

This was

true for the period KOVSHUK was handling him and also for the

BAGRICHEV phase of the operation.

NOSENKO was queried as to

whether during the period between June 1962 ard January 1964 he

He answered:

"No, something is going wrong there with thia

The KGB Agent in Paris (Sat. Rober: Lee JONISON)

(1) Introduction

The lead to the penetratior of a sensitive U.F. military

installation in the Paris area during 1962 and 1903 was the first

plece of irformation NOSENKO gave CiA after reestablishing con-

tact in Geneva in

January 1964.

NOSENKO characterized this lead

then and later as the most important single counterintelligence

item that he had acquired during the year and a hale ho had been

a CIA collaborator at KGa Headquarters in Noscow; the subject of

the liad had provided the KGB with significant documents, some

of which had been

shown to Premier KHRÜSHCHEV personaily.

acrive at the time NOSENKO left Moscow for Gereva,

the agent

nevertheless had lost access to the sensitive information some

norths sarlier.

NOSENKO explainec that the agent was

scheduled

to serain with

ire American Armed Forces in Paris Until May

when he would be

rotated to the United

States.

In the

interim. one of the Second Chiet Directorate's spesial techni-

clans, an expert at opering and resealing envelopes, had been

assigned on extended TDY to the KGS Legal Residency

in Paris

against the possibility that access would be regained before

this transfer.

NOSENKO waS unaware of any other services this

earlier performed for the KGS and estimated that

he had been recruited in 19620

NOSENKO 's lead eventually led to the identification of

T.9. Krmy sergeant Rubert LeE JOHNSON, JOHNSON'S WIfe Hedwig,

ard James Allen MINTKENBAUGH, a friend, as KGB agents.

three had been recruited in Berlin in 1953 and had worked

closely together since.

Although Mis. JOHNSON's direct par-

ticipation (she served

as a courier)

ended with JOHNSON's

transfer from Berlan in 1954 and despite KGB efforts to con-

partment the activities of JOHNSON

and MINTKENBAUCh after 1959,

all three were aware of the others' clandestine work.

NOSENKO 'S

lead to JOHNSON therefore compromised the other two.

While investigations of the NOSENKO lead were proceeding

in the early autumn of 196+, JOHNSON deserted his duty assign-

ment at the Washington Area Courier Station in the Pentagon

and disappeared until the end of November, when he voiuntarily

turned himself in to fir Force Police officials in Las Vegas.

Nevada. JCHNSON had arrived at his Pentagon assignment in May

1964: for the previous nine months he had been serving as non-

cormissioned officer in charge of the classified

control section of the Seine

Area Command Headquarters in

France: for two years before this, until Aug-

ust 1963,

he had been assigned to the U.S. Armed Forces Cour-

ler Transfer Station at Orly Field in Paris.

During the

latter assigment JOHNSON had regularly stood weekend security

watches in the Station's vault area,

and it was to this period

of time that NOSENKO's lead

In confessing to American authorities in January 1965,

JOHNSON admitted having penetrated the Orly vault for

Soviets about seven times during December 1962 and the first

five months of 1963.

Although there were certain differences

in timing and detail, JOHNSON's confession closely matched

the complete description of this operation earlier given by.

NOSENKO.

Except to implicate himself and other participants,

NOSENKC had most recently discussed the case with the TOY "flaps

Geneva

NOSENKO explained that, although as

a Second Chief Directorate

officer re had no rightiul access to

information on this operation, he had worked wich the special

techricians in operations against tourists and ocher foreigners

in loscow and was on good terms with them.

In such circumstences,

NOSENKO

said.

it frequently happens that KGB officers will tell

other KGB officers "some details of operatione on which they are

working."

The agent was described by NOSENKO as being a U.S. mil1-

officer, who served rightime guard

duty with

others at

Aterican military installarior in

France where an airfield was

ard where top secret

documents were held in a vault which he had helped the KGB

to penetrate.

He was scheduled to leave France in May 1964.

Through him the KGB acquired

in the USSR

and France;

"almost all" of these

were of interest to the Soviet Ministry of Defense,

NOSENKO said.

Paris "in case he will get access açair come time, even just a

quick possibility."

NOSENKO's statements concerning this lead

are given in chronological order below..

NOSE::KO said at the 23 January 1964 meeting* that. he first

learned of the successful agert penetration of tre classified

documerts sault at an

"important American military organization"

in the Paris arca shortly after returning from geneva in dune

NOSENKO did not know the designation or preciso nature of

the installation involved

in this operation; but because the

documents irclued information on strategic targets in

Franse 88.

well as in the Soviet Union, he assumed that it was a "strategic

planning irstallation."

He also knew that the installation had

its own airfieid

that there were "procedures for bringing top

secret documen's in and for taking them out."

There had been six successful entries of the vault, four

in 1962 and two in 1963.

On each occasion Special Section tech-

nicians had travelled TDY to Faris under courier cover to assist

the local KGB case officer in the technical details of the opera-

Their function was to advise the case officer. concerning

the entry and later to process the documents.

The case officer,

on this basis, would give appropriate instructions to his agent.

and it seemed probable to NOSENKO that the technicians had never

met the American.

Entry into the vault area was first achieved after the

agent had used some radioactive substance to determine the com

biration.

(NOSENKO thought that the agent had also photographed

the lock for KGB study.)

Subsequent entries were always made

berrien two and five o'clock in the morning.

The agent removed

documents fiom the vault

and delivered them to his case officer,

who in turn passed them to the Special Section techricians.

The

envelopes were then opened, photographs were made, the documents

were repackaged, and the envelopes were given back to the agent

by the case officer for return to che vaule.

Thereafter, the

Paris Legal Residency pouched the films to Moscow, and the

technicians themselves left Paris until the next opportunity

for entry.

The last time the vault lad been entered was in the fall

agent was scheduled for rotation to the United States but, with

his promotion, had obtained an extension until May 1964.

though the agent was still active in January 1954 and was still

assigned to his military post, he therefore had lost access to

the documentary information.

NOSENKO characterized this in

formation as highly

sensitive and valuable to the KGB,

that the Chief of the Paris Legal Residency as wall as several

case officers there had been rewarded for their part in the

operation.

Because of technical difficulties in recording the first

part of this meeting with NOSENKO.

it is not possible to

what NOSENKO said at this time has been pieced to-

recorded recapitulations of his statements by his case

officer later during the meeting and from notes taken at

the meeting.

Finally, at the 23 January 1964. meeting NOSaiKe reported

that three of the Special Section techniciars whe had travelled

to Paris to participate in the operation were S.A. IONOV, L.A.

LEBEDEV, and

S,D. ILYIN; he said he could probably identify more

i shown pictures

of diplomatic couriers who had -ravelled to

Paris.

NOSENKO did not know the identity of the Paris-based

case officer.

the exception of those concerring

strategic

tombing targets, NOSENiO had no information on the nature of the

documents which had seen obtained. He explained that he had

never seen ary of these documents, that the technicians who had

seen them did not read English,

and that they had learned about

the targertira data orly

casually, from asking the case officer

"„hat's this stuff?" at che time

they were taking photographs.

Asked on 1 February 1964 whether CIA could do anything with

its information

concerning the travels of LEgEDEv which might

help to identify the F'GB

agent of the Paria Legal Residency,

NOSENKO replied:

"Of course you can.

For instance, find out

• SINITSYN ard KEPETTROV, whose tirst name and patronymic have

also keen given by NOSENKO as Venedikt Vasilyevich were also

in the Special

section, according to NOSENKO.

**NOSENKO gave CIA a similar clue concerning travel by the spe-

cial rechnicians on 12 June 1962:

"The Chief of the Special

Seccion is sergey IUNOV, an excellent man.

He is on a mission

to Paris.

(Note: CIÀ has been unable to equate any Soviet in

time wich IONOV. There is no record that IONOV

has been abroad under

December 1955.

He made

several trips to Paris and

Brussels during the 1953-1955 pe-

r1oda) ...In the Second Chief Directorate there are good spe-

rath experience.

These lads sometimes go

tralia,

to France, immediately when something is

once.

This means

that there is something (going on) where

they

are seht...

In this Section there are two or three spe

cialists

who

can open any package and then seal it back up as

it was.

Birt

there are only two or three of these altogether,

Therefore, when there is something somewhere abroad, there is

an immediate request to send these guys.

One went to Australla

one or two years

ago.

This means that there was something

there.

One went to France.

Then this IONOV received the

Boyevoye Krasnoye Znamya for this.

Every time (they travel)

they use a different

last name. every time a different one...

There are three men there that can open anything and then make

it look as if nothing had been done... I know them. But they

never come out in their own last names.

Each time they have

a different one.

There were (M.I. ) PREOBRAZHENSKIY,

KAREINIKOV, and LEBEDEV."

In speaking of IONOV's assignment

to Paris and the

travel

of KGB "flaps and seals" specialists

to France, NOSENKO apparently was not referring to the JOHN-

SON case; NOSENKO said he first heard about the case after

returning from Geneva in 1962, and JOHNSON

stated firmly that

the first entries of the Orly Courier Transfer Station did

not begin until late 1962,

about six months after NOSENKO

made this

statement.

In 1964 NOSENKO named both LEBEDEV and

KARETNIKOV as having a part in the Orly penetration. Contrary

to his statement, however,

both travelled under true name

on their temporary assignments.

NOSENKO said on 6 ipril 1961 that before leaving Moscow

for Geneva in January 1904, he had been told that the Paris

Legal Residency agent hed lost his access and that POFANOV was

sent to Paris in the nope that the agent would adain be able

to get into the vaule tefore his transfer to the United States.*

When NOSEIRO arrived at the Soviet Embassy in Paris or 19 Janu-

ary 1904 while on rote to Geneva, SOFANOV "was on duty at the

entrance to the Embassy,

He was the duty man, and of course

when he saw me: he said

So I asked him how this

and he said that,

was not doing arything good but he had hopes that something

might happen.

That's all.'

Also on 6 April 1964 NOSENKO stated that the penetration

operation was "strictly a First Chief Directorate case."

then went on to describe the role of the Second Chief Direc-

torate's technical specialists in gaining entry to the vault

and in photographing the documents:

Paris to instruct the Legal Residency case officer on the technical

aspects of the entry but also was involved in photographing the

documents provided ly the agent.

NOSEiKO tOld CIA on 28 January 1954 that he had learned

of this operation, shortly afeer returning to Moscow from Geneva

in 1962.. from a friend in the KGS,

one of several technicians who

participared in the operation.

NOSENKO thought the source of this

information was either LEEEDEV Or FOFANOV.

During intensive debriefing on 6 April 1964 NOSENKO stated:

"I first heard about this from KARETHIKOV." After describing the

functions of the Special Section in Moscow, he went on to say that

KARETNIKO! came frequently to the Tourist

Department to see him.

The reason for their association was that NOSEiKO then supervised

work with the loscow hotels designated for use by foreign tourists,

Special Section set up equipment in various toums of

these hoteis.

The debriefing continued:

NOSENKO :

And he would say:

'Oh, I have just

maybe I asked KARENIKOV where LEBEDEV was because I hadn't seen

him in a long time, and he told me that LIPEDEY was away on a

trip."

When asked on 29 July 1964 which officers had ever mentioned

this case to him, in any way at any rine, NOSENKO replied "KARET

NIKOV, LEBEDEV, and IONOV in Moscow and FOFANOV in Paris in Janu

ary 1964."

He affirmed that he had never discussed the case with,

or mentioned it to, anyone else.

Having admitted his espionage activities to ACSI and the

FBI, JOHSON gave what he said was the complete history of his

relacionships with

Sovict Intelligence since

the carly 1950's.

The following account is based largely on ACSI rcports to the

U.S. Security board on 12 and 26 jaruary 1965; they provide the

details of his original confession and elaborate on his activities

during his most recent tour in France.*

In 1952, JOHNSON wes stationed in West Berlin were he was

the acting first sergeent of a Transportation.Corps company.

Despondent because he was passed over for promotion and not

the first sergeant position, and believing that his application

to marry would le disapproved, JOINSON decided to defect to the

His first attempt to defect was aborted in February

1952 when Hedwig admitted to JOHNSON

at the last minute that she

had lied to him when she had informed him earlier that she had

contasted the Soviet autnorities in East Berlin and arranged for

their defection as he had requested.

After the initial attempt

to defect: JOHNSON persuaded Hedwig to return to East Germany to

contact the soviets, which she did.

About a weex after the abort-

ed effort to defect:

Hedrig and JOHNSON met with the Soviets in

East Cerrany.

the American

way of life" and wanted to defect to the USSR. JOHN-

for the following week. During the period between the first

meeting anu his marriage to Hedwig on 25 April 1953, JOHNSON met

almost weeklv with the soviets.

JOHNSON was finally told that

he would be of more use to the

Soviets if he were to remain in

at the same time to

tasks for Soviet Intelligence.

JOHNSON has stated that

he refused the money the Soviets offered for his services at

that time, but he continued to work for Soviet Intelligence until

his transfer to Rochefore, France, in April 1954.

During his Berlir assignment JOHNSON conducted the follow.

ing activities on behaif of Soviet Intelligence:

trained in its use.

- After his marriage on 25 April 1953, JOHNSON spent a

week in Brandenberg, East Gerrany, as a quest of the Soviets,

during which time various meetings were held, ustally in

there JOHNSCH was questioned

extensiveiy about his personal life and was asked routine

questions about his organization. He was given a book on

the history of Cormunism which he read several times, and on

one occasion he was questioned to such a degree on general

subjects trat JOHNSON felt he was possibly being psycho-

analyzed.

when JOHNSON returned to rest Berlin, Hedwig

mained in East Germany to act as courier between JOHNSON

and the soviets.

JOHNSON subsequently met with Hedwig on

a weekly basis.

an assignment with CIC or the Military Intelligence Detach-

turned down.

utilizing the Berlin Post Telephone Dilectory, Which he

extremely pleased with this accomplishment.

Vienna in January 1961.

After she had been exanined, JOHN

SON was told that she would have to remain in a private hospi

tal there for an indefinite period of time for medication.

When JOHNSON later returned to vienna,

the hospital doctors

advised him to have Mrs.

JOHNSON live

for several jears in

Vienna with her fanily or, as

an alternative,

in some other

large city with a German-speaking population

in order to

provide an environment to which she nad been

accustomed.

She returned twice to Vienna for shock treatment and

examinations while JOHNSON remained in France.

When JOHN-

SON travelled to Vienna to get Mrs. JOHNSON after the second

of these visits in the fall of 1962, her doctor told him that

she had referred to him (JOINSON) as a "Russian general"

and had accused one of the nurses of

being a Soviet spy.

(Earlier,

in the presence of neighbors, JOHNSON was accused

by his

wife of being a spy.)

JOINSON learned from his

father-in-law that Nes. JOHNSON had also told him that JOHN

SON was a Russian general.

Eventually Mrs. JOHNSON was

persuaded to connit herself to a U.S. Army hospital, and at

the end of April 1964 she was evacuated from France

to Walter

Reed Hospital in Washington. (JOHNSOY and his children

returned to the Unlied States several days later.) She was

relcased shortly afterward, but her erratic behavior, JOFN..

as over-sexed.

had tripled over what they had previously been and she never

tend to confirm this evaluation.

He has described Mrs. JOHN

SON as being a nyuphomaniac who indiscriminately indulged in

any kind of sexual activity with persons of either sex.

thermore, for two years she prostituted herself regularly with

JOHNSON's knowledge while weekending in Las Vegas; he gamoled

with the proceeds.

Nevertheless, JOHNSON

(e) Soviet Concern About birs. JOHYSON's Illness

When it became apparent that his wife's treatment in

Vienna had been unsuccessful and that he would have to

leave Orleans to find a more suitable environment for her,

JOHNSON discussed the

matter. in detail with his KGB case

officer.

In the fall of 1962, after he made photographs

of the vault door for URCHUMOY, "the Minox camera was re-

turned to the Husslans.

This (according to JOHNSON)

was done

because of Soviet concern over Kedy's mental condition.

JOHNSON

was instructed to retain no incriminating naterials

in his possession."

After URZHUSOV learned of Mrs. JOHNSON'S

confinement in a U.S. military hospital, JOHNSON said he

ary 1965 that there was no particular

pressure concerning

the emergency contact and escape arrangements

"except that

there was always the question and coucern that nis wife

might talk."

Soviet fear that Mrs. JOHNSON might talk also was re-

flected in the handling of MINTKENBAUGH in Kashington.

MINT-

KENBAUGH explained to the FBI that "during the period

when

Hedy was confined to an Arny hospital in Europe [November

and December 1960 his KCB case officer arranged with him

to effect an 'eye-to-pye' meeting at Brentano's Bookstore

in downtown Washington, D.C.

MINTKENBAUGH was scheduled to

visit the bookstore three

times a week for a three-week

period.

The Soviet indicated that this procedure was to be

adopted in order that it would be assured that Hedy bad said

nothing during her hospital confinement which would expose

the operation.

MINTKENBAUGH said that he presumed that the

Soviets had efforted arrangements in Europe to becone aware

in the event liedy would reveal any facts concerning her know-

ledge of Soviet Intelligence.

In the event Hedy did talk

and a dangerous situation resulted, the Soviets were to ad

vise MINTKENBAUCH through a drop or by a meeting."

*In other tellings, JOHNSON has also said that the espionage

equipment, which included a Minox camera and tripod and a

flashlight with a

"hollow-battery" concealment device, was

returned to URZHUMOV at his (JOHNSON's) own suggestion.

4 Unsuccessful Approaches to U.S. Citizens*

&. The HAPMSTONE Case

(1) Introduction

After providing the two promised leads** at his first

meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962, NOSENKO then volunteered

that the KGB in 1958 or-1959 had made an unsuccessful re

cruitment approach to Richard C. HARUSTONE,

Secchd Secretary

at the U.S. Embassy in "loscow.

Inttially NOSENKO said that

the KGB had photographs of MARYSTONE in homosexual as well

as heterosexual

acts; but in 1964 he stated that although

the KGB knew HARMSTONE to

be a homosexual, it had no photo-

graphs of hin in such activities.

The KGB,

thanks to micro

phones in the Embassy, learned that HARISTONE did not tell

U.S.

authorities the full story of the approach, omitting

the

fact that ine approach was based partly on his homo-

sexuality.

HAFNSTONE's report of the approach was

however,

the Section.

Intervier by the Embassy Security Officer.

In keeping with his instructions from U.s. authori-

ties, HARUSTONE lunched with

"Sergey" that afterroon and

thereafter avoided holding meetings

with him.

After his

reassignnent from Moscow in October 1959, HARUSTONE admitted

to the Department of State Security Office that he had a

homosexual background and the phötographs shown to him by

KOVSHUK had been genuine, but he again claimed to have refected

the recruitment attempt.

HARUSTONE subsequently resigned from

the Department.

Among the CHEREPANOV papers passed to the Moscow Embassy

in November 1963*** was a document dated August 1958 on the

KGB plans for operational activity against HARMSTONE.

#NOSENKO has described a total of five unsuccessful attempts

by the U.S. Embassy Section, American Department. KGB Second

in Moscow.

tary code clerks KEYSERS

The KGB tried to recruit him,

but he re-

fused the approach.

Previously the KGB lad used both female

and male agents against him, and the KCB had photographs of

the homosexual side

ciprocal basis (cooperation in arrarging visits with economiets,

visits to the institute, etc.) trying, on his part, to obtain

TURPIN, HARUSTONE himself,

economists, particularly in the Institute of Economics of

Also, "Sergey" offered to assist HAR STONE In his career,

who was either the Security Officer or the counterintelli

gence representative in the embassy.

He had a dog:

in an apartment in the city or i country house outside Yoscow.

His Russian maid or cleaning woman

was his mistress.

The KGB

thought he would not be recruitable by ordinary blackmail on

the basis of his intimate relations with his naid, so the maid,

a KGB agent, was lostructed to confess to him that she had

been recruited by the KGB against her will and would be ar

He agreed to

help her, and COLITSYN believed that he did

not report this

He also recalled that the

American first supplied only disinformation to the KGB, but

when the KGB complained, he provided a mixture of truth and

disinformation.

GOLTSYN said this case study was based on

a true incident which took place between 1953 and 1957, but

he was not sure if the operation really did result in a suc

The BINDER Case

Information frOn NOSENKO

While reviewing notes he had brought to a meeting in

Geneva on 26 January 1964,

NOSEYKO first mentioned the

unsuccessiul attempt to recruit Peter BINDER.

NOSENKO said

that BINDER, the

"top Sergeant in charge of merica House,"

of the American Department, took part in the approach.

was ir 1962, NOSEiKO said,

aiter he had transferred to the

•Icurist department, ind for this reason he could provide

no further details on the case.

(11) Information fron BINDER

Master Sergeant Peter BINDER arrived in Moscow, where

he was assigned as manager of America House,

on 16 March 1961.*

He was approached by

the KGB on 15 January 1963 and reported

the KGB sitempt to lS. Embassy officials the same day.

On

22 January 1963 BINDER

was withdrawn from Moscow before the

completion of his tour.

At the airport as he was leaving,

the Soviets attempted to prevent his departure by saying

that he had rever beer properly accredited to the USSR.

The plane was delajed for about 15 minutes while a heated

exchange took place between Soviet officials and tho American

officers accompanying BINDER.

He then was allowed to leave.

The following

description of

the Soviet recruitment attempt

is drawn fron debriefings of BINDER by the U.S. Embassy

curaty officer in hoscow on the day of the incident and

debriefings by the FBI and Department of the Army after his

return to the United States..

In about December 1961, according to BINDER, he first

became intinate with MORELLI, a dishwasher at America House

whom he has described as being a pretty, intelligent, well

manicured girl of about 25.

Their relationship continued

until June or July 1962, at which time SORELLI "disappeared"

from her Job without notice while BINDER was on leave. During

*It was BINDER who summoned the Embassy Security Officer,

Hugh MONTGOMERY, to Anerica House

of the U.S. military code clerk Matthew ZuJUS.

their affair,

BINDER occasionally gave MORELLI glfts of

money and clothing but restricted his mee isga with her to

his room in the dormitorg.

In about February or Jarch 1902

MORELLI Same to BINDER and said that she thought she was

pregnant; she sade no dezands of BINDER, horever,. and sald

nothing about getting an abortion. Although at his first

Interview in Moscow DINUER said that MORELLI at no time 1n-

dicated that she was required to obtain information for the

Soviets, he told the FBI: in late February 1963 that on 030

occagion

in big rcom at Anerica House MORELLI admitted to him

that she wag sent to America House by the Soviets and that

all employces there were required to meet in two groups once

a month with their contacts (KGB officers) to discuss the

America House personnel.

While he was

enroute, a car pulled up beside him, three

"goons" strong-

arned him into the back seat, and he was driven to a nearby

Militia station.

some perfunctory questioning, one -

of the Militianen made

several phone calls, and an interro

gator arrived a few minutes later.

The interrogator had a letter which he said had been

mailed by MORELLI to the L.S. Embassy and had been inter

cepted by the KGB.

The letter contained numerous allegations

against BINDER,

which the interrogator proceeded to list.

Among them, BINDER was able to recall the following:

On 25 November 1961 there was a party at America

House for Soviet enployees,

a?ter which BINDER and

MORELLI wont to BISIER'S rOOM.

Subsequently BINDER

and MORELLI lived together as man and wife.

mAt another part,,

in December 1961, BINDER

pointed out five enlisted men living in America House

the letter named them telling MORELLI that they were

informants for John f. ABIDIAY, the Embassy Security

Officer.*

He told MORELLI that the girls working in

America House should be particularly careful of Charles

GIDARO, as he was ABIDIAN's right-hand Dan.

-In February 2962, MORELLI told BINDER that she was

pregnant, and BINDER instructed her to get an abortion.

-At the George Nashington's Birthday Party in 1962

BINDER pointed out ABIDIAN

to MORELLI and svetlana

IVANOVA, another employee of Anerica House, and told them

to be careful of bin as he was the Embassy Security Offi

cer.

—At some point BINDER gave a sewing machine to a

Soviet citizen to sell for hin

At another time BINDER

ordered from the United States' a coat for the America

House employee Luba TISHKINO, but then told her that 1t

had been lost in the nail.

The coat was not really lost,

however: BINDER gave it to one

of the old cooks at Ameri

ca House because she paid him

money for it.

"See Part V.E.J.d. concorsing NOSENKO's responsibilities for

the KGB coverage of ABIDIL.

•After asking whether BINDER was acqualnted with

M5. LOHRER of the hes! Cerman isbassy, the interrogator

asked if BINDER hid given LOHISR goods to sell on the

Soviet market.

-In April 1962, BINDER told MORELLI that Hugh

MONTGOMERY had arrived at the U.S. Embassy as Security

Oficer, that HONTCOWZRY was & food friend of his, and

that be had told SONTGOXERY about his affair with

MOREEtI but NONTCOVERY had told him not to vorry about

it.

-BINDER told JORELLI and Sietlana IVANOVA thet

Richard C. JACOB,* a U.S. Embassy employee, was a "well-

trained spy" and thai MORELLI and IVAYOVA should there-

fore be carsful of hir.

In describing his conversation at the Militia station,

BINDER said that,

after

the interrogator had asked'a number

of questions, he, BINDER, cosplaired that the Soviet was

talking too fast.

An interpreter was thereupon called in

and remained until BINDER as questioned concerning JACOB.

At this point: the interpreter left and tha interrogator

continued to question BINDER on persozal matters.

Except

for the

relatively short time the irterpreter was there,

all questioning was in Pussian, which BINDER gererally undere

stood.

After discussing BINDER's fasily, the interrogator

asked BINDER what ought to be done about

the letter and the

charges it contained.

He suggested that if the letter mere

sent or

so the imerican Ambassador, to whom it wes addressed,

U.S, officials would not believe BISDER's denials of the

charges: his career in the Army would be ruined, and BINDER

wuld no longer be able to support his two daughters.

According

to BINDER, his reply was that there was nothing

he could do

1f the Soviets

decided to forward the letter, and "that would

be that."

The interrogator then left the room.

When he returned about 15 minutes later he spoke to

BINDER in a frierdly manner, commenting

that BINDER had been

in Moscow for almost two years and that it was obviously

Important for him to finish his tour there and remain in the

BINDER agreed with this.

The interrogator then said

BINDER's actions

while in the Soviet Union had been quite

that he had always been very fair to the Soviet girls

who worked for hin, and that be, the interrogator, had decided

to help him.

The Sovist continued that he was going to forget

about the letter and ail the charges contained

in it and that

the letier would not be forwarded.

He also pointed out that

was not going anywhere, there was no need for

BINDER to mention the incident of his arrest to anyone. BIN-

DER was then driven back to the barber shop.

BINDER summed up the entire ircident, which lasted &

I1ttle over two hours,

by saying that the

approach. was very

low-key and that at no time was he specifically asked to aup

ply intomation to the Soviets, although this was implicit in the

remarke of his interviewers.

Operations Involving Other Westerners

a. Tabulation

(1) Introduction

NOSENKO has provided identifying information on 90 XGB agents,

probable agente, and operational contacts of western (but non-

American) citizenship and he has described an additional 12 de-

velopment and investigation operations

against such third-country

nationals.

As indicated in the

folloking tabulation, 55 of

NOSENKO's recruitment leads and five of

the 12 anvestigative

and developmenta: leads were contained in the notes which he

brought to the meezirgs with CIA in Geneva in 1964 and

which

en

abled him to provide

specific information on these individuals,

for exampie, their dates of birth and precise dates of recruit-

ment.

At the same time,

however, NOSENKO generally furrished

comparatively fever details concerning

the KGB

operations against

other Westerners than he did in his leads to

American cases;

often his information did not exceed that written in the notes.

He has disclaimcd personal participation in all bu. four of his

recruitment leads

and

two of his investigation/developrent cases.

For the most part NOSENKO's foreign leads are based upor informa-

tion which he said he learred casually and noted for passage to

CIA during

the time he was Deputy Chief of the Tourist Depart-

ment in 1962 and 1963.

The VASSALL Case

Information from NOSEiKO

At the 11 June 1962 meeting with CIA, NOSENKO first mention

ed the lead which was later equated with William J.C. VASSALL, the

KGB agent in the British idmiralty.

Neither then nor later in

1962 did NOSENKO identify this agent by name.

NOSENKO was asked on 11 June 1962 whether he had ever heard

af the KGS agent George BLAKE,

man who compromised the famous

tunnel operation in Berlin."*

NOSENKO replied:

I'11 tell you this, that there was a far more important Englishmi

who was our agent than BLAKE.** He is a very big man,

and fron him

We get all the details about NATO.

He is our number one agent, the best of all intelligence informa-

He had been in Moscow, and

we recruited him there.

him on a homosexiality charge, a very extreme one involving multi-

ple persons.

The case Oificers who recruited him received the

Order of Lenin...

He is not an intelligence man.

He is a high-

ranking mar.

He is working on all kinds of NiTO matters and 1s

delivering mose valuable information...

He was in Moscow some

time ago.

My friend and three others in the KGB section running

him received the Order of Lenin.

That is a very high distinction

for the KGB...

I do not know the man's name, cut I do know when

he was in Moscow, and I know that he has a very high position.

He is in London now." NOSINKO was reluctant to go into further

details at this, his second meeting with CIA, but he added:

tell you all about him tomorrow, my brothers.

I will tell you

many things tomorrow, and the day after...

This is our number

one operation. There is no sum of money we would not be willing

to pay him."

The next day NOSENKO was asked for additional information

"high level British agent," and he told his case offi-

"I don't know the exact content of the material (he was

giving) except that they were very valuable military documents.

and I know that he even brought in draft copies when he was here

in Moscow.

He went to London,

them extremely valuable material.

He is either a deputy or a

First Secretary, or a member of the secretariat; the most im-

portant thing being that all material of the greatest signifi-

cant value passes through his hands.

He was recruited in 1956

I don't know when he returned to London, but he was

working with the (KGB Legal) Pesident there, who was at that

time a man whose name is Major General (N.B.) RODIN.***

BLAKE, a British MI-6 officer, has admitted that he informed

the KGB of the Berlin tunnel operation

(which involved the

intercept of Soviet and East German telephone conversations

by CIA and MI-6)

prior to the time the operation became

active in May 1955; it was terminated in April 1956.

** In September 1964 CIA sought more details from NOSENKO about

BLAKE He responded:

"BLAKE? Who is BLAKE?" When reminded,

NOSENKO said:

Secretary.

Prior to that he was the Chief of a section ir the

about three years ago, ard at that time he personally recruited

the Englishman."

NOSENKO told :CIA on 13 June 1962 that the "high-level

British agent" had on one occasion provided a report on an Anglo-

American conference in London, which contained referençes to

American and British Intelligence operations.*

Duringfinal

meeting in 1962, a day later, NOSENKO again stated that RODIN

had received the Order of Lenin for his part in the operation.

When asked whether the name KOROVIN meant anything to him in

connection with operations against the British,

he replied: "I

heard that name.

but I cannot associate it in any way.

Possibly he is the man in London now. "**

After recontacting CIA in 1964, NOSENKO reported that he

had alreary provided almost all he knew about VASSALL, who had

been arrested in 1962.

VASSALL, NOSENKO summarized, was re-

cruited in Moscow and turned over copies of official Embassy

documents while there. After he returned to England and while

he was working in the Admiralty, he was considered to be the

KGB's best agent.

His value, NOSENKO said, was indicated by

the fact that CHURANOV had received a KGB award for his role

in the recruitment and then later,

when VASSALL was producing

in England, the Order of Lenin along with RODIN, the handling

officer in London.***

NOSENKO on 1 February 1964 said: "In general it was known

from some source important information was coming in from

the British, specifically,

information about NATO,

as the NATO Intelligence Services would hold a meeting in

London, we had the information as to what was discussed.

When the American, Canadian, and British groups met in

London. The material came in from that VASSALL, or from

someone else--I don't know." On 8 September 1964 NOSENKO

commented further that in

1960 or 1961, about the same time

he heard about these materials, he also learned that the

KGB First Chief Directorate had a good source: in British

counterintelligence.

NOSENKO said that he did not know

whether VASSALL had access to this type of information or

whether this indicated another source.:

** NOSENKO was asked on 29 January 1964 whether RODIN, VASSALL'S

handler in London, was also known as KOROVIN. He replied he

thought so.

#*#Questioned on CHURANOV's' reaction to VASSALL'S arrest, NOS-

ENKO stated on 29 January 1964 that CHURANOV had said: "Nell,

this is all.

This is the end of my career and I'll never go

abroad again. "

Shortly afterwards®

CHURANOV went to GRIBANOV

to ask to be returned to the Second Chief Directorate for this

reason.

flaps were a result of information from coLiTSy!, particularly

VASSALL.

records here that he was given VASSALL's material to read in

connection with his own work."

NOSENKO said on 8 Septemicer 1954 that his fears that tre

articles in the western press might eventually bring him under

suspicion were allayed when he learned from CHURANOV soine time

later that the First Chief Directorate had reluctantly decided

that GLITSIN must have been the

the VASSALL lead. The

leaders of the First Gief Directorate did not want to believe

at first that GOLITSYN was the source of the lead, but it was

known that although GOLITSYN did not know VASSALI's rame, he had

on one or two occasions translated materials received from

(11) Information from GOLITSYN

On 26 March 1962 GOLITSIN was being interviewed by British

authorities and provided information leading to the identifica-

cion of VASSALL as a KGB agent.

GOLITSY: said that he worked

in the International Treaty Organizations Section of the Infor-

mation (Reports) Department of

the KGB First Chief Directorate,

from September 1959 until May 1960.

During this period he re

ceived documents from the British Admiralty which were coptes

of papers from top Admiralty officials concerning the construc-

tion and financial expenditures relating to a naval base at

Clyde, dated July 1959.

On the basis of many of these docu

ments

to prepare a report for the Soviet Minister

of Defense.

He said that he was told that the British Depart-

ment of the First Chief Directorate had also disseminated

information,

ard after contacting the Rritish Department he was

given a large file of copies of original documents from British

Admiralty, including documents of the First and Second Lords of

the Admiralty.

(The documents he read were Russian translations

of copies of original British documents.)

There were other

documents covering all Admiralty activity mentioning navy bases,

fleet commands in

the Mediterranean, hden and other cities in

the Mediterranean area.

There were also docurents dealing with

bases in England ard concerning important questions and deci

sions in the Admiralty:

According to COLITSYN, these documents were received from

an agent source in London, covered the period 1958-53,

usually received at two-month intervals.

He related that he had

talked in 1955 to a KGB officer friend, Ye. G. KASHCiEYEV, * who

vas recalled to the USSR in 1954 from London.

KASHCHEYEV told

GOLITSY that at that period KGB had two other important agents.

one of whom was BLAKE.

The other important source was working

in naval intelliçerce in 1954, but GUI.ITSYN said he did not know

the identity of the KGB officer handling the ramiralty agent

He suggesied, however, it could have been A.V. ZARANCV

because that officer received the Order of Lenin for his work in

England at about that time.

During a 5 April 1961 interview GOLITSYi was shown a selec-

tion of documents concerning the British Naval Command Organiza-

tion in the Mediterranean.

He selected two cocuments he thougnt

he had seen before.

although he said he was not sure,

documents were: (a) Internal Admiralty Memorandim,

When GOLITSYN was shown additional British documents on

7 April 1962, he recalled he had seen documerts concerning "the

whole infrastructure program, the whole of NATO." as well as

documents concerning rotes of meetings held in the Admiralty.

GOLITSYN said on 25 May 1962 that the photographic repro-

ductions of the documents were of medium or better quality, in-

dicating they had been reproduced by a process better than hand-

held Minox camera production.

official hamiralty documents dated betweer. 24 July ard 3 September

1962; all were reported to be secret documents,

which would gravely damage the security of the state.") In his

confession,

VASSALL described his recruitment by CHURANOV, and

another man, known only as "Sikolay" in March 1955 or the basis

of compromising photographs taken during the course of a "homo-

sexual orgy" involving himself and a rumker of Soviets. at the

Berlin Hotel in Moscow at the end of October 1954.

September 1955 on until he returned to England, VASSALL bought

KGS silence by bringing CHURiNOV and "Nikolay" documents from

the British Embassy.

In May 1956, in anticipation of his depar-

cure for home, vassall was introduced to a third Soviet, subse

quently identified as RODIN/KOROVIN, who was to become his con

tact in Lordon.

Their first meeting

the end of August 1956.

VASSALL continued to meet RODI! once

every three weeks until the arrest of Soviet Illegal Gordon LONS-

DALE in January 1961, which resu'ed in a four morth moratorium

on personal meetings.

To these meetings VASSAL would bring docu-

ments that he obtained from his office

Division of the Admiralty; the ducuments would be photographed

and returned to VAssAlL durirg the same meeting.

Several months after RODIN had

broken off contact as a re

sult of the LONSDALl arrest.

VASSALL was contacted by N.P. KAR-

PEKOV*and there were infrequent meetings from then

until May

19620

It was not until May 1962, however, that VASSALL was told

to resume his espionage collescion; he was trained to operate an

Exakta camera and used it thereafter until his arrest.

The last

two meetings with KARPEKOV took place on 13 and 17 August 1962.

At the meeting on 13 August, KARPEKOV told VASSALL that he was

going away on holiday and the further meeting four days later

was arranged so that VASSALL could hand over anything he had

obtained before KARPEKOV left. At their final meeting, KARPEKOV

arranged for their next meeting to take place on 30 October 1962.

(KARPEKOV left London for the Soviet Union on 6 September 1962.)

from the Soviets was just before Christmas 1955, when he was

given "at least 1,000 rubles."

On his returr. to England, RODIN and later KARPEKOV paid

500 and 700

NOSENKO was asked why this Canadian was considered to be

an Illegal rather than an agent.

Reaffirming that he was an Il-

legal, NOSENKO explained that

"an agent always has legal status.

This man may run an Illegal not.

And they may give him money

to support other Illegals, and therefore that is the category

assigned to him."

The CIA case officer

summed up this

new infor-

ration by saying: "Therefore, in addition lo the classic type os

NOSENKO was asked why Guk

"GUK sorehow got

It was simply an acquain-

tance."

In later interviews NOSENKO added that the Illegal:

Rumania, and then flew to Geneva where

his genuine documents were returned to him.

NOSENKO also said that the KGB had decided to have the Illegal

remain in Canada after originally planning to assign him to

New York City, where he would be under the control of the local

KGB Legal Residency.

6. The BELITSKIY Operation

a. Introduction

Wnen NOSENKO first contacted CIA in June 1952, one of the

two pieces of information which he said he was willirg to sell

was

the fact that the

agent BELIISKIY was under KCB control.

(B.Xe. BELITSKIY, a Radio Moscow broadcaster and Soviet Govern

ment interpreter,

had been a CIA agent in place since his recruit

ment

at the brussels Exposition in Septenber 1953.)

At the time

NOSENKO made his irformation known, BELITSKIY had met CIA repre-

sentatives in the West

in debriefing sessions on three separate

occasions.

The last occurred in Geneva in May 1962 while BELIT-

• SKIY was serving as an interpreter for a nio Conference.

time NOSENKO was also in Gereva, participating in the Disarmament

Conference.

b. Information from NOSENKO

(i) Statements zn 1962

In the discussions with CIA officers on 9 and 11 June 1962,

NOSENKO revealed considerable information on BELITSKIY.

He also

until the spring of 1962.

Conference, NOSENKO said, he received a cable froin Moscow direct-

ing him to give advice to the "young" and "inexperienced" case

officer, V.L. ARTEMYEV in thé event that American Intelligence

should contact BELITSKIY in Geneva.

Actually, NOSENKO continued,

the Second Chief Directorate had

"inserted" BELITSKIY into the

WHO delegation in the hope that CIA would "find him."

There was

handling of the case insofar

had recruited in London and never met inside the Soviet Union.

never any contact with him inside."

NOSENKO said that at that time he himself was Deputy Chief of

Although BELITSKIY, ir meeting with his An-

being contacted by mexican Intelligence in Moscow, NOSENKO

claimed that this was a ruse and that the real KGB

"Don't trust him for a second dut..• give the

chosen for this task be "elderly," that they not be connected with

CIA in any way, and, most important, that they mail the letter

immediately on their arrival.

NOSINKO also advised CIA to do

something about the safe apartment in which "Bob" and "Henry"

had met BELITSKIX.

He complained that BELITSKIY had noted that

the name on the door was not that of the American Counsellor

supposed to be, and he said that BELITSKIY

When he came to the West again in 1964, NOSENKO again dis-

cussed the BELITSKIY case.*

January 1964, he was asked his

advice about CIA's handling BELITSKIY.

Again he suggested that

"continue the plan" in order to determine

"what actions they

NOSENKO said he did not know who recruited BELIT-

This operation, like

all "games" of the Second Section, was supervised by M.G. MATVEYEV,

Deputy Chief of the American Department..

In 1964 NOSENKO made a number of comments and observations

which he had not brought up in any way in 1962.

In noting,

example, that BELITSKIY had originally been a British Department

agent, he remarked: "laype they tried to serve hin up to the

On 2 February 1954, when the CIA case

officer suggested that perhaps RELIISKIY might not have reported

everything to the KGa, especially the anount of roney he had

and I told ARTEMYEV rhat I didn'e believe that the Americans

NOSENKO said that when he told PETROV that he did not believe

BELITSKIY, PETROV said he lad not quite accepted his reports

either. becauseevery time BELITSKIY came home from abroad, "he

always tries to hand me

some gift and therefore I'm inclined

to agree with you." NOSENKO said that BELITSKIY had been

thoroughly investigated but that he himself felt that "it is

possible that at any given moment a person would change his

mind and go off."

NOSENKO mentioned fur the first time,

10 June 1964, that the British Department had a file "in which

material had been placed which would indicate that there were

some suspicions" about BELITSKIY, but that "this 'suspicious'

file was not given to the Second Section, American Department.

Information from Other Sources

BELITSKI? was a chemist by training and a translator and

radio commentator by profession.

At the time of his recruit

ment, and throughout his relationship with CIA, he was employed

by Radio Moscod.

Fluent in English, he was used primarily as

a scientific commentator on programs beamed to the British Isles.

In addition to his radio work, BELITSKIY frequently served as an

interpreter for the Soviet Government, both

at home and abroad,

and achieved considerable recognition

in this capacity during

such widely publicized events as the POWERS trial

and GAGARIN'S

visit to England.

Ostersibly he was

fully trusted by the Soviet

authorities and was allowed

an unusual degree of freedom in his

association with foreigners.

FELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in Brussels in September

1958 while he was serving as an interpreter

at

the Soviet Pavil-

ion of the norld's Fair.

During the period in which he was being

assessed as a potential

agent, BELITSNIY created the impressions

that:

first,

he was not in full agreement with the current so-

iet

regime and probably even harbored some grudge against

Soviet system because his father häd been purged under STALIN:

second, he was not averse to considering defection at some future

date, provided he could do so with his wife; and third, he was

eager to pick up extra money, in return for which he was willing

to provide information

acquired in the course of his duties.

product of the operation.

In August MI-6 gave CIA its view:

BELITSKIY had come to London with a Soviet intelligence brief:

his attempts to contact Nesterners were so blatant that the KGB

must have known about them; but it was possible that not all of

the agent's activities were necessarily controlled by the KGB.

In September 1960 CIA advised MI-6 of its agreement that BELIT-

"undoubtedly had an RIS mission when he came to the uk

earlier this year," adding the opinion that he probably had

been used in the past by the KGB; also, that the only way to

resolve the unexplained points, CIA stated, was to engage in a

secure interrogation which would include a polygraph examina-

He

was questioned closely (albeit in a friendly manner) about his

relationship with the kob.

He explained that he bas frequertly

but that his only official briefing by the KGB

was in connection with the POrERS trial.

On another oscasion,

he said, he was told how to handle himself if the wrong" ques-

tions were asked

at the MARTIN/MITCHaLL press conference in

MOScOW,

but this

was not operly a KGB briefing.

BELITSKIY also

indicated that all travellers leaving the USSR were routinel?

interviewed and briefed, and were told to "sort of keep their

eves open" to locate potential targets of information.

He said

he felt

that "whatever he had been

able to do along this line"

had resulted in his being given iDY's abroad and having relative

freedom of movement.

At the end of the london debriefings it was concluded by

MI-6 and CIA that BELITSKIY "did not appear to be practicing

deception or to be

controiled by the RIS." Both did agree, how-

ever,

that he was "evasive when pressed, then glit, but without

volunteering information.

The majority view at that time was

that the agent's prime motivation. was a financial one, coupled

with an assurance of CIA assistance upon his defection.

It was

also believed that BELITSKIY had by then become so deeply in-

volved with CIA that it would be very difficult for him to break

contact and/or to report his plight to the KGB,

The third contact with BELITSKIY was made in Geneva in May

of 1962.

The CIA

case officer met the agent six times, for a

total of approximately 12 hours.

At this series of debriefings

a second

American case officer was irtroduced.

In his report on

the contact

the original case officer stated that he felt

"stronger than ever that

Subject's potential as an agent is

unlimited."

He stated that his original views on BELITSKIY'S

bona fides had not changed and that he felt the latter realized

that he had passed the point when he could afford to report his

collaboration with CIA to the KGB.

The second case officer

reported that the reservations which he had had about the agent's

bona fides before the meetings with him had been dispelled by

the latter's manner.

He also reported, however, that on two

occasions during the meetings he had had a "sinking feeling"

that "the relationship was not kosher."

He said that during

the discussion of the two factions which BELITSKIY claimed

were then vying with each other in the Soviet Union

(the

"moderates" vs. the "hard-liners"), he had the feeling "that

the tale was concocted and maybe the agent was trying to convey

to U.S. authorities something

that someone warted to have convey-

could not have done through normal charrels."

The second

case officer was also struck by a change which he perceived in

BELITSKIY's manner when they were discussing the matter of con

tact inside the Soviet Union: At first,

BELITSKIY was very con-

cerned, but toward the end of the meeting he seemed to abandon

all caution and to be quite happy about it, even suggesting that

a CIA courier could perhaps bring him some scarce goods.

Throughout the relationship, however,

BELITSKIY exhibited

great concern for his personal safety.

During the period between

the initial and the second series of meetings. CIA sent him two

open letters containing secret writing.

He responded to the first

(in time to validate the terms of the contract), but not to the

second, explaining

in a later meeting that his failure to do so

had been due to fear for his own safety,

His reasons for this

fear (including the fact that the handwriting on the open

letter

was

"typically Anerican"'), were juaged plausible and convincing,

and his desire

to discontinue this type of communicatic was

respected.

Although BELITSKIY did not wish to communicate by

secret writirg, he did later agree that

"in a matter of gravest

importance" he would permic CIA to send him a message via some-

one with whom he could be, logically, in professional or social

contact.

He stipulated, howriver, that it be someone who was

entirely "clear."

and completely unwitting of the true nature of

his

relationship with CIA.

He insisted, moreover,

on a guaran-

tee that if CIh ever did have to communicate with hin by any

means, it should never refer to the subject of a previous

conversation.

He felt that urder such circumstances he would

stand

a better chance of refuting any accusations.

since there

would be no evidence that he had responded

to the

overtures of

American Intelligence.

BELITSKIY also expressed concern on sev-

eral occasions for the case officers' welfare as it related to

his own, cautioning them, for instance, never to go to Berlin

or to Moscow.

BELITSKIY was deemed from the first to have access through

his work to infornation of unusual value to the United States

would be successful in

these areas.

On the other hand. he

did appear to have access to some nilitary information of a

He also had knowledge of

the attitudes and activities of certain

was acquainted with several Westerners who had defected to the

USSR.

Also,

BELIISKIY remarked chat he had once known someone

who had lived in the nouse of "the real Rudolf ABfL."

this

friend had told him that Rudolf Ivarovich ABEL, the KGB Illegal

not actual, source of positive intelligence information who was

basically motivated to help American Intelligence.

After the NOSENKO information was received in June 1962.

CIA continued the BELITSKIY

operation.

A fourth

series

of meet

ings was held with the agent in the United States in October of

1962. BELITSKIY was at that time accompanying a Soviet delega

tion to "The Second Informal Conference of Influential Ameri

cars

and Soviets" (at hidover, Massachusetts), a gathering of

prominent Soviet and American citizens to

discuss international

problems

in the interests of world peace.*

The Soviet deleca

tion of 16 was headed of a member of the

OPSU Central Committee,

who was listed as a representative of the Soviet Trade Union

Press.

The conference occurred during the Cuban crisis, 21 to

27 October 1962.**

During this

extremely critical period in Soviet-American

relations, BELITSKIY cormunicated the following points to his

CIA case officers:

- The members of the delegation had been briefed in

Moscow by the First Deputy Foreign Minister to be concilia-

tory, even to the degree of pointing out that the soviet

Union disagrees with China on the distribution of nuclear

weapons to other powers, and to avoid any position which

could be regarded as offensive to the American partici-

pants.

- BELITSKIY "personally" regarded President KENNEDY's

announcement of a

weaned from the Soviet Union by very careful handling

without alienating opinion in other countries, and that

the President's action tended to strengthen the position

of the "hard line.

tough talk" faction in the Soviet

Government.

Immediately following the President's an-

nouncement, the delegation was instructed to make the

Soviet position plain,

but to do so in a moderate tone.

- The leader of the

Soviet delegation had partici

the President's stand on Cuba.

According to BELITSKIY,

who had acted

as interpreter, the Soviets' reply to

COUSINS was that the USSR had

refused to give nuclear

weapons to China

ard that there would se no point in

risking

an affront to Communist. Chira by giving advanced

weapons to Cuba.

He said the Soviet Urion was willing

to enter into negotiations with the United States on the

question

of the spread of nuclear weapons co other

countries.

(COUSINS" explanation of President KENNEDY'S

stand

was

that he was pressured by the coning

election

and the need to circumvent critisis oy the Republican

Party; by Congressional leaders; and by a report that

Congress would soon learn of the irrefutable evidence

concerning the

ROSENKO fulfilled this promise.

The KG3 intercepted the

LANGELLE, about three in number.*

During an examination and discussion of that portion of the

CHEREPANOV papers bearing on the POPOV case, NOSEiKO on 3 Febru-

ary 1954 confirmed the authenticity of their contents and re

affirned that surveillance of the letter-mailina by WINTERS had

- GOLITSY named a KGS officer who had been

stationed in Vienna where he was working on lugoslay

targets; this officer was aware of POPOV's association

with

the Austrian woman (see above), suspected POPCV,

and although re reported his suspicions,

All of this occurred while POPOV was serving

In Austria (until September 1955).

Some time in 1957 or

1958, GOLITSYN, continued, the KGS was told by a sourse that

POPOV was an agent.

The KGB then assigned this KGB officer

to Germany because

he. knew POPOV and was familiar with

the background.**

- General I.A. SEROV was Chairman of tie KGB when

the first information about POPOV's agent status was

received.

In summary, what GOLITSIN has said about the compromise indicates

that a KGB agent provided the lead to POPOV and that this lead

was received in 1957 or 1958.

As stated above, POPOV's message of 18 September 1959 said

he had been arrested in the previous February: 1f this

portion of the message is correct, the orientation there-

fore

indicates that the KGB observed the first LANGELLE

POPOV brush contact, on 4 January 1959, and POPOV was

arrested some time after the second brush contact; on

** Although COLITSYN gave this officer's name as KOTOV,

GOLITSYN's Other facts about him make it clear that he

was referring to KGB Colonel M.V. ZHUKOV.

Stationed in

Vienna during the 1953-55 period and, like POPOV, working

against Yugoslav targets, ZHUKOV was

personally known to

POPOV.

On 23 November 1957 POPOV said:

"Can you imagine

whom I ran into in Karlshorst two or three times?

It was

my competitor on Yugoslav operations when I was in Vienna.

Do you remember ZHUKOV of the KGB?...

He may be assigned

here or /may be/ on TDY, but he has just come recently."

(A year later POPOV reported that ZHUKOV was still in

Berlin/ Karlghorst working, he believed,

operations.)

in Anglo-American

It would thus appear that the KGB sent

ZHUKOV to Berlin not long before 23 November 1957 and in

connection with the investigation of POPOV.

***SEROV was KGB Chairman until the latter part of 1958.

In January 1964 NOSENKO gave a detailed account o the compro

mise of GRU Colonel O.V. PENKOVSKIY, the CIÀ and British Intelli-

gence (MI-6) penetration agent whose arrest by the kos was

announced on

2 lovember 1962.

In i subsequent debriefings and in-

terrogations NOSE::KO has offered

further information on certain

aspects of the PENKOVSKIY compromise, continuing to maintain that

it was brought about by KGB surveillance in Moscow during 1962%

Also according to NOSENKO, it was not until the latter stages of

the operation that the KGB realized American Intelligence was

involved with MI-6 in this operation.

The reports by NOSENIO and other sources on the PENKOVSKIY

compromise are presented below, but to place them in context.

they are preceeded by a brief summary of the PENKOVSKIY operation

the CIA and MI-6 standpoint.

(ii) Resume of the PENKOVSKIY Operation

In August 1960 PFNKOVSKIY gave two American tourists

age of materials to deliver to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

materials included a description of a proposed dead drop site at

Number 2 Pushkin Street, which PENKOVSKJY had selected for a pos-

sible communication channel; in the letter PENKOVSKIY enclosed in

the package, he also gave his home teicphone number and instructions

for a call to be placed to him at a certain time to indicate that

the package had been received and that the Americans were interested

in further contact with him. Efforts to make this teephone con-

tact with PENKOVSKIY failed, as did several additional efforts on

his part to establish contact with the U.s. Embassy.

The Pushkin

atreet address was checkeù from the outside on two occasions there-

who walked past the building on 12 November and 4 December 1950.

On 21 January 1961l

went inside the building and checked

the precise

location of the dead drop site, behind the radiator

in the vestibule of this building. (on

December 1961, John

ABIDIAN, U.S. Embassy Security Officer

and coopted CIA

worker,

also went inside the building to check for possible loading of the

dead drop by PENKOVSKIY.) In April 1961, PENKOVSKIY succeeded in

making contact in Moscow with the British businessan, Greville

WYNNE, with whom he was already acquainted from previous trips to

MoscoW by WYNNE. Through WYNNE, PENKOYSKIY passed to MI-6 docu

ments and notice of his forthcoming trip to London in April.

MI-6

promptly notified CIA, and the two services jointly conducted the

operation. until it was terminated by the KGB on 2 November 1962.

Throughout this period PENKOVSKIY served in a GRU element

under cover of the State Committee for Science and Technology

(GKKNR) in Moscow, and it was under GKKNR cover that PENKOVSKIY.

travelled abroad three times, to England in April-May and July-

August 1961 and to France in September-October 1961.

to PENKOVSKIY's personal meetings with American and British case:

officers while on these IDY's, there were 27 exchanges of

materials in Moscow.

The CIA and MI-6 intermediaries used for

these exchanges were WYNNE, on his business trips to the USSR; Mrs.

Anne CHISHOLM, wife of an MI-6 officer stationed as the British

Embassy:*

compronised, NOSENKO answered

that he had "all the details"

and

then gave the following account:

Ever since the POPOV case (see Part VI.D.7,a.) there

surveillance

of personnel

from

the U.S.

British Embassies in Moscow.

As a result of this sur

veillance, Mrs. CHISHUL' was seen ducking into an alcove,

evidentiy

following a Soviet citizen whom the surveillance

team was unable

identify.

Surveillance coverage of

Mrs. CHISHOL! - and, indeed, on all British Embassy per-

sonnel - was immediately increased, and she was soon

observed following the same Soviet citizen on the street

in a clandestine manner.

The Soviet citizen was identi

fied as PENKOVSKIY.

The KGB immediately launched a full investigation

of PENKOVSKIY, including a complete check of his back

ground.

To avoid alerting him, knowledge of the investi

gation was kept to a minimum,

and surveillance of him was

restricted to stationary points in the neighborhood of

his residence and office.

As one part of the investiga-

tion, a man who closely resembled PENKOVSKIY and dressed

like him was made to walk in front of Mrs. CHISHOLM when

she was on a Moscow street; when she began to follow

this man, the KGB thus obtaired confirmation of its

identification of PENKOVSKIY,

Another part of the in-

vestigation entailed a search of the PENKOVSKIY apartment:

to accomplish this, he was given a drug which made him

so ill that hospitalization was necessary,

and. Mrs.

PENKOVSKIY was lured from the apartment on a ruse: nothing

was fourd during this search,

The KGB next aimed a power-

ful telescope at the window in PENKOVSKIY's apartment and

obtained an apartment directly above his; from: the over-

hanging balcony of the apartment occupied by the KGS some

flower pots were suspended, one of them able to take

pictures through the window of the apartment below; ir

this manner the KuB photographed PENKOVSKIY removing

"suspicious materials" from the back part of his desk:

in the search of the apartment which followed, these

materials were found in the desk, but the KGB left them

By the time wille visited Moscow in July 1962, both

he and PENKOVSKIY were

under surveillar.ce, and their sus-

picious behavior in front of the feking Restaurant on

5 July gave the KGB another conclusive indicator of PENKOV-

activities.

Also, the XGB was able to monitor

conversations between PENKOVSKIY and AYNNE in the latter's

hotel room, despite

the fact that PEIKOVSKIY turned on

water faucets while they were talking.

PENKOVSKIY was arrested only when the KGB knew that

WYNNE was scheduled to go to a Satellite country.

SKIY gave a complete confession, and it was only at this

point that the KGE realized Americar. Intelligence was in-

volved in the operation.

After PENKOVSKIY revealed details

about the Pushkin

Street dead drop, the KGD correlated this

information with that contained ir

was apprehended there.

The KGB felt that it had obtained all pertinent in

formation from PPNKOVSKIY and that he was "beyond redemp-

tion" even for future interrogation.

PENKOVSKIY was

executed.

In subsequent questioning soon

after his defection, NOSENKO

repeatedly claimed that the KGB had no prior knowledge of erican

Intelligence participation in the PENKOVSKIY operation until

JACOB's arrest on 2 Novemoer 1962 at the Pushkin Street dead drop,

NOSENKO was asked in July 1964 for details on the KGB

official report (obzor) about the PENKOVSKIY case.

He said that

he had rever read the report because, although printed, it had

not been circulated as

of the time of his departure for Geneva

in January 1964•

By O.M. GRIBANOV (Chief of the KGB Second Chief

Directorate) and "various other case officers," however, NOSENKO

was told of certain of the items which would appear in

official report

and most of which he had already reported.

fact that the KGB surveillance team had failed to identify

PENKOVSKIY at his first observed meeting with Mrs, CHISHOLM,

NOSENKO added at this time, would not be included in the report,

According to GRIBANOV, whereas the report would state the KGB

knew PENKOVSKIY was working for both the British and American

services, in reality the KGB did'not know of the Americans'

involvement until PENKOVSKIY was arrested.

NOSENKO said that the KGB investigation of PENKOV-

SKIY was handled by officers from the British Department racher

than the American Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

except for V.M. KOVSHUK of the latter department.:

Furthermore,

NOSENKO stated, the KGE interrogators attempted to force JACOB

to admit he was a British citizen.*

In Februery 1965 NOSENKO provided his most. complete account

of the PENKOVSKlY compromise and the KGs investigation which

ensued :

•The first that PE:XOVSKIY apreared in life of the

KGB was during one of mile's visits to Moscow.

The KGB

knew of PaNKOVSKIY's acquaintance with dYN*E and that he

was even visiting him in the hotel where WYNNE was staying.

The KGB checked with the GRU,

and the GRU answered that

PENKOVSKIY was working on WYNNE as a target,

PENKOVSKIY

was working in the GiziR as a cover, and MYNNE was one of

his acquaintances.

Later, there was massive surveillance

of the emplojees of the British Embassy - I don't know

exactly with whom - but PEKOVSKIY was noticed being in

contact with someone from the British Embassy: but sur-

veillance lost him..-

Later he was nosiced with the wife

of British Embassy officer CHISHOLM.

At this point, the

KGB didn't tell the GRU anything, because the GRU had no

right to have any contact with any loreign embassy people

without telling the KCB - except at official

receptions

and functions.

and even here they have to tell the KGB

so that

curveillance will know.

And when surveillance

noticed PENKOVSKIY with Mrs. CHISHOLM. they immediately

recognized him as the guy they had lost.

"This was the beginning of the

very active work on

PENKOVSKIY - without telling the GRU.

They (the British

Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate) were checking

his work at the CiKiR,

They managed with the help of

the KGB Third Directorase*to look at his file.

they tried to control him at home.

They were

put him under regular surveillance because he would

immediately find out - he was a capable officer - but

they put surveillance on him from time to time. However.

they set up a closed (fixed surveillance) post

building opposite his apartment, about 200 meters

They got a flat there, set up a post, and watched his

window with a telescope.

They also used the flat directly

above PENKOVSKIY's flat.

Here they even put microphones

to hear his conversations with his wife and tapped the

telephone of course,

Then they noticed that he was hiding

something in his desk, taking the drawer out and putting

something behind,

And when he was taking off his shirt

he was putting notes

(inside). They noticed him taking

pictures.

Above his flat there was a balcony with

flower boxes.

They put a camera in the flowers somehow

which could be lowered so that it could take pictures

through PENKOVSKIY's window by command (remote control)

from the closed post.

This was to get evidence, to

see the documents he was working with.

"There was another meeting with wYNNe.

PENKOVSKIY

met WYNNE in WYNNE's hotel, They spoke in the bathroom

"They decided to enter PENKOVSKIY's apartment and see

what was hidden in his desk.

In the GRU they controlled

what documents PENKOVSKIY was taking...

"They used a drug to pur him in the tospital, a pre-

paration which they put on his chair.

He inhaled it irto

his body and got sick.

His skin became reddened and he

felt pain and had to go to a dostor, a military doctor who

put him immeciately in the hospital.

He went to a military

hospital - they were ready for him there - and was hospital-

ized...

They considered

disguised as a soldier cane to PENKOVSKIY's flat and coid

his wife that the doctors wanted her to be checked because

it was possible PENKOVSKIY had a contagious disease. not

serious reys had been made before.

She went to the hospital, and the flat was en-

tered.

They took pictures of

everything.

They found many things, code pads and so on,

which showed that he was really working. Ater that they

decided to arrange his arrest.

"PENKOVSKIY was supposed to go abroad, and the KGB

did everything to prevent it, but in such a way that he

wouldn't understand.

They even cancellea a whole deleça-

tion.*

This was while they were still trying to get proof.

"Then WYNNE came to Hungary,

They arrested PENKOVSKIY

and I think one or two days later they took wYnne.

"The manner of arresting PENKOVSKIY was such that

even GRU wouldn't know about it. (D. M.) GVISHIANI (head

of the GKKNR) took part.

He told PENKOVSKIY to come with

him to the Central Cormittee, and when they were down in

his car he said: "Wait here a minute while I get a docu-

ment I forgot. "

There was an entrance on Gorky Street,

but the car was in the courtyard behind. The KGB was

waiting here.

PENKOVSKIY got in the car, and that was

it - he couldn't call out, no one saw it.

"Two days later I knod that (General S,G,) BANNIKOV

(Deputy Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate) flew

to Hungary and took WYNNE.

I don't know the details of

WYNNE's arrest, but I know that BANNIKOV returned with

WYNNE..•

"I know that during the search PENKOVSKIY's daughter

came home from school early.

I know that one of PENKOY-

SKIY's fomale relatives or one of his wife's female rela

tives was a former KGB agent, and she intercepted the

girl...

It was necessary that they see each other at a dis-

tance before making contact.

I don't remember exactly,

but there was a little park or square, and there was some-

thing connected with CHISHOLM's child, something connected

with

candy.

"And about the Pushkin Street you know - that was for

PENKOVSKIY.

"The investigation was a big secret.

I found out only

when he was arrested.

It was in 1962.

Maybe a month or

half a month before the arrest I might have heard that

there was sonething hot in the Second (British) Department...

The Secord Department officers were rurning around. (G.V.)

BONDAREV (of the British Department) was running to GRIBANOV

and didn't have

to wait.

Something was up, bur what?

May-

be (A.V.) SUNTSOV (of the British Department) told me: 'Soon

we will nave an outstarding success.'

I think that he said

that to KOVSHUK and me, because it was obvious that some-

thing was going on.

In GRIBANOV'S outer office it was

noticeable that BONDAREV was running to GRIBANOV every

day...

GRIBANOV then dismissed others, even turning away

his deputies.

BONDAREV was always there.

So I knew some-

thing big was going on, but I didn't know what - maybe it

was a

recruitment.

"Of

course, I could have heard something from surveil

lance.

I was going to the dining roon with Venyamin KOZLOV

(Chief of the American Departmerit, KGB Surveillance Direc-

torate). I was close to him in 1960-1961. I went with him

in the

general's dining room occasionally. KOZLOV would

say: 'Something is going on in the Second

ment, KGB Surveillance Directorate).:

Because he knew

the chief of surveillance for the Second Department..•

"I don't remember where I was when the arrest was

announced...

The officers in the First Department didn't

know what was going on.

BONDAREY asked JACOB to confirm

that he was an Englishman.

They were expecting an English-

man, not an American.

The First Department was stunned

when they found out that an American had come to Pushkin

Street..*

"The first time the KGB saw PENKOVSKIY and WYNNE

together they asked the GRU about it, I think even (GRU

Chief I.A.) SEROV himself, wether PENKOVSKIY was working

with wYNNE. And PENKOVSKIY had written up something about

his contact with WYNNE.

The GRU replied that the contact

was official...

was coming as a businessman.

GRU doesn't have a counterintelligence mission against

businessmen,

The Second Chief Directorate does,

Before an approach could be made under any set of circuu-

Two years later, In February 1950,

it was reported that

CHEPEPANOV maintained limited social cortacie with the U.S.

Air Attache and Coneul in Belgrade.

In April 1956, at a "farewell intizate luncheon" at-

tended by a representative of the American Embassy, CHERE

PANOV stated that he was roturniny to loscow where he hoped

to be assigned for a year or two, but he was not certain.

According to a report dated June 1956, CHEREPAYOV had

been active in courting people from the Ü.S. Embassy 1o

Belgrade,

and as of the time of the report, had gone

to the USSR "probably to work in the foreiga Office."

More exto. sive information on CHEREPANOV was provided

In 1057 by Milos GREGOVIC,

a Yugoslav who defected to the

British in Octobor 1957.

He had been a UDB agert working

in Belgrade agairst foreign diplomats.

CHEREPAYOV was one

of his operational targets.

According to this source,

CHEREPANOV was first posted to Belgrade in 1948 or 1949,*

and was one of the very few Soviet diplomats who remained in

Belgrade alter the broak with the Cominform, at which tire

he was charge d'affaires.

In 1932 or 1953 he became First

Secretary and head of the Consular Department.

The main reason for the UDB certainty about this

was the wide scope of his contacts with Yugoslav workers

*The break between Yugoslavia and the Cominform took place

in June 1948.

There was so formal break in diplomatic rê

lations between the USSR and Yugoslavia, although there was

no. Soviet Ambassador present in Belgrade fron 1950 to 1953,

and there was no Soviet military attache representation pre

sent from 1851 to 1953.

According to the Yugoslav diploratic

11gts, Aleksandr CHEREPANOV arrived in Belgrade sometime in

1952, appearing on the diplonatic list for the first time in

November 1952, as Second Secretary.

He was one of only

seven Soviete appearing on the diplonitle list at this

time.

The now Soviet Ambassador appeared for the f1rgt time

on the November 1953 list, bringing the total diplomatic

representation up to eight.

suspicion.

On several occasions the UDB had felt it had

almost enough evidence

to enable the Yugosla: Government to

expel CHERFPANOV, but the evidence was never completely

satisfactory®

Thus in 1954 GREGOVIC was assigned the task.of com

promising CHEREPANOV's wife, Irene.

Approximately three

months after he met her, CREGOVIC

persorally.succeeded in

compromising Irene.

He continued to handle her as an in

formant over a period of about a year and a half, during

which tine he also maintained their personal relatiorship

on a spasmodir basis.

Irene's information enabled the UDB

to discover that CHEREPANOV had established a network of

and its vicirity.

Subsequent information established

the

fact that he was also in close contact

with trade unton

leaders and particularly with river

port workers,

a number

of whom were subsequently found to be

anti-Yugoslar and pro-

Soviet in their outlook.

Another Soviet, an

intelligence

officer who had been

recruited by the UDB, contirmed

to

GREGOVIC that CHEREPANOV was a nember of Soviet Irtelligence.

The Soviet said also that CHEREPAYOV had been an intelligence

officer during the war and had at one stage been parachuted

behind the German lines on a special services operation

which resulted in the kidrapping of a German general.

GREGOVIC described CHEREPANOV as "always smiling but

1n

fact an extremely cold and cruel individual."

Although

he did not appear to be emotionally attsched to his wife,

he was extrenely jealous aid watchful of her.

He frequently

urged his wife to use her exceptional beauty

and seductive

charn in cultivating Yugoslav officials in order to obtain

information.

GRECOTIC also said that CHEREPANO! LaS VEry

MOSCOw.

He

explained his interest in obtalning second-hand books.

In a few minutes an Engiish-speaking Soviet was seat to

the lobby, and he idertifird himself as Alsksandr siko-

layevich CHEREPAYOV.

After discussing the librarian's needs

with him, the wan agreed to cooperate with the Arericas.

There were three more contacts with ChEREPANOr, all 10 the

lobby of the same building.

The last cortact was on 4 November, at which time

CHEFEPAYOV inforned the libzarian that the book procurement:

had been approved for

Then, speaking softly and quickly in Russiar,

KG3 found no documents

Thus there were a numver oi irdications pointing towards

CHEREPAIOV, Who had leit the section. 1.

The KGB did not

dare alert

him by putting full-time survelilarice on him, but in

stead mounted fixed

survelllance posts

at his home and office.

In order to provoKe CHEREPAYOV into some presipitous action on

the basis of these suspicious poins, a former KGB colleague was

sent to visit him and, in the cour-e of conversation, to mention

the great disturbance

in the KGB be:ause someone had passed

The area was covered with very deep woods,

"where a person could lose himself for life."

On the severth

on his way to the Iranian border.

A special plane was immediately sent to Baku, carrying

S.M: FEDOSEYEV and several other American Department officers.

They picked hin up and headed immediately back to Muscow,

interrogating CHEREPANOV on the plane.

He imnediately con

fessed to having given the documerts

to the Americans.

When asked why,

he said he was "angry at the KCB, very

angry," and besides, he thought he might ask the Americans

for

some money. In return for

the documents.

He confessed

that on 4 Novenber he had passed the documents to an Ameri

can tourist wio was a librarian Irterested in Russian books.

He said he had given the documents to this American in the

entrance hallway in the building of the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs, the building in which the Ministry of Foreigo

Trade was also housed.

Because of the fact that CHEREPANOV had eluded the KGB

between the two fixed

surveillance posts which had been

established, the Second Chief Directorate suffered consider

able criticisn for not putting CHEREPANOV under full, round-

the-clock surveillance.

CHERFPANOV himself, however, told

the KGB that had he detected surveillance on himself

he

would have written to the government and newspapers a latter

of protest against "such an indignity, such persecution,"

and then would have committed suicide, leaving the KGB

without proof.

CHEREPAYOV was in prison when NOSENKO left the USSR

(on 18 January 1964) and would be shot, but the affair would

not be publicized.

In addition to his wife, CHEREPANOV

would leave a daughter as a survivor.

the Soviet Union; in addition to sumnarizirg the infor

mation collected

Secretary from July 1957 to July 1959 (docuneat dated

October 1960) and Wallace L. LITTELl, Attacie

from June

1956 to July 1958 (document dated October 1960).

There are four opcrational plans for agra: work

against Amcrican diplomats stationed in Moscow at the

time the plans were prepared:

Richard HARNSTONE, Second

Secretary (document of

August 1958; Lewish. BOWDEN,

Second Sceretary (document of Feuruary 1960'; Cam-s

RAMSEY, Second Secretary (document of February 1960);

and George WINTERS, Attache (on date).****

*One paragrapi

of the document refers to American surveil

lance

of

Soviets in New York City, and the next paragraph

begins:

"The intensity of survelliance was uneven.

From

November. 1957 to April 1958 a decrease was noticed in the nui-

ber of

surveillance teans

assigned

to work directly against

Soviet employees.

This did not mean, however, that the Ameri

can

surveillance service reduced its surveillance of Soviet

employees as a whole."

The dates cited here approximate the

period,. from

late November 1957 to mid-Jarch 1958,

when the

FBI was conducting surveillance of two Illegals in New York

City as an outgrowth of an operational lead fron

CIA source

POPOV (see Part VI.D.7.a.).

Information from JOSEYKO rela-

ting to FBI surveillance is discussed in Part VI.F.

**PEKLISOV is the true name of the former KGB Legal Resident

who served in Washington, D.C., under the alias

"FOS:EN."

**#NOSENKO identified V.A. KUSKOV as an officer in the Second

Section, Anerican

Department, KCB Second Chief Directorate,

and

said that CHEREPANOV worked in the same roon with KUSKOV.

There is a handwritten document comprised of names

of Soviet citizens, headed

with a state

these are auttors of letters addressed to the

U.S. Embassy

Where dates of the letters are given, they are for Octo

In a few cases the contents of the letters

are characterized (e.5.,

"request for finarcial aid--

5,000 rubles," "complaints about

inability to live or

pension'').

Under two of the names a note appears,

which looks as though it had been added at a different

time or with & different pen, but in identical hand

writing;

the note says

"letter enclosed."

Althougn the sample on the docurert described

next is only a signature, it may well be the same hand.

The nane is CHEREPANOV'S.

This docurent, the only docu-

ment having for its subject a Sovict citizer, is a type-

written summary of derogatory inforcation on a Soviet

youth who began to lead a dissolute life in 1957,

beconing a black market

speculator and a homosexual.

As a consequence he was expelled

from the Konsordl and

from the Institute at which he had been studyi=g.

He

nonetheless continued his criminal activities,

iscludirg

contacts with

foreigners for purposes of fleeirg the

USSR, despite warnings by the militia and the Nit, and

he had two long meetings with Attache Richard SNYDER,

"Consul of the American Embassy," to discuss his wish to

go to America.

The document,

dated February 1960,

is

signed by Lt. Col. A.

CHEREPANOV, "Senior Case Offlear

[no

section indicatedl, First Department," of the Second

Chief Directorate.

(Presumably the document is relevant

to the Anerican Department because of the contact with

an American diplonat.)

*On 24 May 1958 LANGELLE visited the area of the dead drop

site referred to herein with his wife to case and photograph

the site area.

The site had been described to him as

certain section of a wooden staircase

in the park area.

When his report was received at ClA Headquarters it was

obvious that because of inadequate information, he had

cased the wrong staircase, so he was told to go back as

soon

as possible and repcat the casing for the other stair-

case.

He did this on 28 May 1958,

bringing his children

for cover.

He did not put a drop

down at this or any other

time.

A

legal travel agent actually put the drop down on

7 June

1958.

This drop was not intended for the agent re-

ferred to in the CHEREPANOY document, REPNIKOV, wio in fact

was not even a recruited agent at the time, although efforts

were being made--unsuccessfully-during this time to recruit

him.

At no time was any dead drop put down for REPNIKOV,

DOr

were any ever planned for him.

NOSENKO's Comments on the CILEREPAYOV Papers

On 3 February 1964 NOSENKO was shown all the CHEREPASOV

papers with the exception of the FEKLISOV report on opera-

tional conditions in

the United States.

Just b=fore

given to him to read,

they

NOSENKO was asked if he had been

He said he knew that the documents portained to

BOWDEN, RAISEY, HARUSTONE, WINTERS, and LASCELE,

but he

had not read them.

who in thin Second Chirt Cirectorate

kner exactly which docunents were involved, NOSENKO named

S. M. FEDOSEYEV, Chief of the

Ameriran Dopart-eat it the tine;

GRIBAYOY,

the Second Chief Directorate; sod G.I.

GRYAZNOV,

the U.S. Embassy Section.

Those three

officers,

had possession of the docum-its after

they were returned by iiD to the KCB.

NOSENKO then proceeded to examine and ried aloud ths

contents of the docurents, making «ccasional ixpiaratory

comments as he went along.

lie identified the randwriting

of CHEREPANOV himself, as well as that of KISkUi, KOVSHLK, and

BELOCLAZOV. Concerning the substance of the documents, i0

SENKO made

very

few comments.

in discussing the opcrational

plan for work against WINTERS, NOSENKO noted that this docu

: cat,

which was a hardsritten draft, had been sigred by

KOVSHUK, Chief of the U.S. Embassy Sectior; SUSESKO then said:

"He should not have signed this.

I do not know why he signed

1t.

He should not have

signed it." Asked why not, he said:

"Because it is

a drait.

He should have sigrd the typed

copy.

Ard why he signed the rough draft I do not krok..."

As he studied the agent report which KO SIlk receired

from source "LILIANA," concerning WINIERS, NOSENKO cormented

on KOVSHUK's failure to fill in the line

which is intended

to identify the safe apartment or operational apartment

where the report was cceived.

"It is obligatory

to india

cate the place,

in

the second line," he added.

"It is

obligatory to write in the

number of the persoral iile (this

did appear in the document] and where the cortact took place."

Reading aloud the agent plan for BOWDEN, described

therein as the FBI man in the Embassy, NOSEYKO came

to the

section which states:

"Ironically one day as though by

chance he BOWDEN! blurted out to our agent SHEDOVA'

'ARTUR's* affiliation with American Intelligence." He was

interrupted to be asked who "SHUEDOVA" was; NOSESHO said:

"Cleaning woman undoubtedly. An affiliation of 'ARTUR' with

American Intelligence."

He was

then asked:

"What connee-

tion did 'ARTUR' have with American Intelligence?"

To this

#"ARTUR" was the KGB cryptonym for NOSENKO's agent Arsene

FRIPPEL; see Part V.D.5.

TOP SENIT

## Page 223

NOSENIO replied:

"That I cannot say." The CIA case officer

remarked:

"Why, you should know, jou're his case officer..."

NOSESKO ignored this comment and continued to read the docu

ment aloud.

A little further on in the document reference

is made to use of future agents to report on BOWDEN; again

"ARTIH" is ment.oned, and NOSENKO identified nim this time

"I asked FRIPPEL, and he said

'But I know nothirg."

"How is it you do not, when ho is

the counterintelligence man

in your Embassy?

He interrogates

And he answered:

'But no, he is a good man.'"

In reading a draft report which appears to nave been

attcopt to summarize the KGB information

on WINTERS, NO-

SENKO read out the sentence:

"During his

stay in the USSR,

WINTERS sent eight

espionage letters,* and

loaded a drop

In connection with a gane the KGB played with American Intel-

ligence."

He was asked if he knew about those eight letters.

but he sald he did not.

XOSENKO retorted:

"But at that time I would not have run hin

down.

He did not know that he had letka

on hin.**

the jear 1902 did you know about writka? to, I don't believe

jou did."

At this, he was

you mean those eight

letters were detected from Metka? NOSE KO said:

"Of course."

The case officer asked:

"Not Iron surveillance?" NOSENKO

said:

1NO.

Beyond the fact that he could be

seen nailing

then, the rest Metka gives.... Well, that letter which was

mailed by WINTERS to FOPOV was without Metka.

for POPOV definitely was without setke.

But the other

letters, that was not so.

I would not blame him.

How would

he know?

He put them in

his pocket--that's all." NOSENKO

added that the letter which was sent to POPOV was one of the

eight letters to which the document refers.

NOSENKO then reviewed the document concerning Richard

HARUSTONE. * **

He repeated his earlier statement that HAR

STONE had been compromised and had been approached by the KGB,

that be turned down the recruitment offer, but that he did

not report the approach to the u.s. Embassy.

how the KGB knew that he had not reported the approach, to

which NOSENKO replied:

"He was monitored and we would have

if anything about this matter had been re-

ported.:. Undoubtedly if he reported it something would have

been heard fron the Minister Counsellor's materials as to

what this might be.

Ard they would dictate a message about

this. "**** Later NOSENKO was asked who tried to recruit HAR!STONE.

**The first source of information on KGB use of Metka, the

KGB code name for

thief powder or detecting powder, was

NOSENKO, in June 1962.

***See Section VI.D. 3.e. for & discussion of the HARISTONE case.

****HARMSTONE did report the KGB approach, and the Minister

Counsellor's office was the site of a discussion of the case.

Into the departient. This was in the year 1953 or 1959.

STONE. *

*CSENKO waS

asked:

"Is he still in the Department?"

He replied:

"I don't think he is. i don't think he is

concersed with it any more."*

NOSE KO read the document which set forth highlights

Of LANGELLE's operational activities

in Moscow, chiefly

devoted to the POPOV case, but also including information

(inaccurate in

detail) concerning a dead drop site in Lenin

Hills.=*

As be read this section he commented:

"Incidentally,

they (the KGBl found the dead drop and contents by accident.

Little children, children."

Asked if kc knew arything about

this incident of Lenin Hills, he arswered,

"Xids.

Russian

children found it by accident.

For after

LASGELLE had left

the area, surveillance checked over the area, but they found

nothing....

Reading further he come to the statement that

it was later establisied that the dead drop was interded

for the person already arrested by the KGB,

REPYJKOV.

To

this he added that REPNIKOV was known as Stanisia. "Slava"

REPNIKOV, who had been recruited by some tourist; these de

tails were not included in the CHEREPANOV documert.

He was

asked if REPNIKOV had been arrested and was chereafter

working under KGB control, but he said this was not the case.

ile explained that he had been arrested, and the YüB there-

after

"roughed him up once in a while" becaust he was of the

category of Soviets who were known to associare with foreigners.

He did not know what American tourist had recruited REPNIKOV,:

but he was aware of the fact that REPNIKOV had not beer

arrested until after the tourist had left the l'SSR.#**

When he was reviewing the sumar; of inforcation on

LITTEL, who had left the USSR before the sunmary was pre-

pared, JOSENKO was asked if he knew anything ahout one of

the Soviets named as a one-time contact of LIPIEL'S, B.P.

VORONTSOl. The document, a rough draft with corrections,

contained a statement that a moeting between LIfEL and

*KOVSHUK was identified by HARISTONE as the KGB officer who

made the approach.

**See the foregoing section on the contents of the CHERE-

PAYOV package for details on the inaccuracies included in

this document.

***REPNIKOV had been reported as a dissident Soviet youth

as early as 1955,

and in 1957 he told one of his Anerican

contacts that he

had once been arrested and served time in

a Soviet prison at some time for one of his attempts to

escape illegally

fron the USSR.

He was arrested again there-

after for a second plan for escape, and he was given psycho-

logical treatment as a result.

REDNIKOV was in contact with

& number of

Americans and other Western travellers again in

1958 and 1959.

In September 1959 another Soriet,

of his,

told an American tourist that REPNIKOY had been

arrested after receiving a letter from an American which

thanked him for his interest in being an ageat and gave him

directions for

future contacts.

VORONTSOV took place on the strect, and they went to a

restaurant together.

It further said that VORONTSOV was

continuously in contact with foreign tourists.

These tHo

lines are

crossed out in the draft, and in their place is

written:

"The Second (Counterintelligence and Security)

Department of the UKGB for the city of Moscow is fully

oriented concerning him." NOSENKO was told that VORONTSOV

most recently worked for Inturist at the Hotel Hetropol in

Moscow, and that he had had a number of meetings with

American students and with tourists.

NOSENKO commented:

"This is

agent work.

He is an agent." He was asked, "But

to you nothing is known?"

NOSENKO sald, "Absolutely nothing."*

NOSENKO went over the rest of

the CHEREPANOV documents

rapidly, for the most part simply reading them aloud, with

side remarks on topics unrelated to the dodoments or

Americans discussed therein.

*In the summer of 1963,

VORONTSOV had contacted two different

groups of joung Americans and told

them

of his

plans for e8-

cape from

the

Soviet Union.

He also told them

he had informa-

tion about KGB agents through his Inturist employeent, and

that the American authorities should be told of hin and his

plans; he passed on an elaborate code system which was to be

used to get in touch with him to assist him in his

escape

plans. He

was so open in his contacts, unrealistic in his

plans, and insecure in his conversations with the young_Ameri

cans (none of whom had any intelligence connections) that

when they reported to American embassies in the West, VORONT-.

SOV was immediately assumed by U.S. authorities to be either

a clumsy provocateur or a

fanciful, immature youth.: Nothing

further was heard from VORONTSOV.

There had been no previous

record of him in CIA files; the CHEREPAYOV document was the

only confirmation of his other contacts with foreigners.

the next day, NOSENKO tempered his earlier

He reported that

only on rare occasilis.

This information was further qualified

during the interrogations of February 1965 when HOStKO said that

State Department enciphered traffic

was broken

very sel-

dom" during the 1960-1961 period and that "we (the

"yerY.s. Embassy

Section] never saw these documents."

NOSENKO has not changed his

original

statement that the KGB has never been able to break

the

military codes.

NOSENKO has stressed that he has no aptitude for technical

matters and had no interest in or access to information on

spe

cific techniques used by KGB cryptologists to break the imerican

codes.

He suggested in general terms,

however, that KGB suc-

cesses in this field were made possible in part by information

obtained from

American cryptographic personnel who defected and

were recruited in

the late 1940's and the 1950's, in part by

information from the microphone installations in

the two mili-

tary code rooms and certain U.S. Embassy offices.

NOSENKO has

not specified how this information was used or which of these two

categories of sources was of

greater value,

although he did re-

port that the loss of KGB ability to read the State Departnent

codes coincided with and was largely a result of the installation

of an acoustically secure enclosure for cryptographic operations.

(The date was late 1961 or early 1962, according to NOSENKO, but

actually late 1962, according to U.S. authorities.) At the

same time, NOSENKO

indicated, the microphone in the military code

room

(which was probably effective until late 1960,

was of little use.

There is a degree of correlation between NOSENKO's informa-

tion on KGB cryptologic successes and that earlier, reported by

Te was for this reason that his own and the section's "number-

one mission" in 1960 and 1961 was

b. Information from SOSENKO

From his personal experience, NOSENKO said in 1962, he knew

that the KGB Eighth Directorate had broken the enciphered mes-

sages of the U.s, Embassy in bloscow but not those of the military

elements

there.

At the end of 1961 or the beginnirg of 1962,

however, the

according to NOSENKO

some details on

the types of Embassy

enciphered traffic being read in clear text and on the way in

which the clear text was treated within the KCB Second Chief

Directorate; in addition, NOSENKO has indicated that the KGB used

microphones in the Enbassy and exploited human sources to further

its cryptologic work.

These points are reviewed separately below.

(i)

Breaking U.S. Ciphers

The first reference by NOSENKO to KGB cryptologic successes

against U.S. Government enciphered traffic was

at his sec-

neeting with ClA on

At that tine he raised the

subject in connection with his personal security new that he was

in contact with CIA. He said:

During the third mecting, on 12 June 1962, NOSENZO revised

his statements sade the day before.

He now said that only cer-

tain of the State Department codes

had been broken, and that he

had only rarely seen the clear text of deciphered cables. NOSENKO

repeated that nilitary cipher systems had not been

Not we (the KGB Second Chief Directoratel but the

They are reading some things."

Asked whether the KGB was reading all the State Department's

enciphered traffic or only a small part of it, NOSENKO replied:

"Not all.

We are not reading all the State Department (traffic)."

He also said, contrary to his statement of 11 July 1902 that he

saw the deciphered traffic "every day," these documents reached

"very seidon"--at the nost "ten or twelve times" during 1900

and 1961.

Following

his defection, NOSENKO reported that he had learned

in discussions with G.I. GRYAZNOV of the American Department

KGB Second Chief Directorate, during 1962 and 1963 that the KG?

could no longer break State Department enciphered traffic by the

end of 190l or the bezinning

(Earlier, on 24 January

1964, NOSENKO said that he knew "definitely" that the

KGB Eighth

traffic of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.)

At about the same time

that State Department traffic could no longer be read, NOSENKO

reported, various U.S. Embassy officers were less often heard

ment from the U.S. Eabassy Section, American Department, about

in their offices.

This der-topment had led CRYAZSOV and S.V.

FEDOSEYEV (Chief of the American Departzent) to conclude that a

"room-within-a-room" had been installed in thie tabassy and that

security reasures had been instituted.there.e

After his

transfer fron the American Departent in carly 1962, NOSENKO con-

tinued, he also had occasion to discuss the KGB ioss of code-

breaking capability with GRIbAYOY, Chief of the Second Chief Direc-

frow him NOSENKO learned

that the Contral Committee of the

Communist Party was

exerting considerable pressure on the Chairman

of the KGB for continuation of. the material formerly obtained in

this manner; consequently, the KCB Chairman as demanding maximum

effort from all officers

in the recruitment of code clorks.

In the second series of hostile iiterrogations, on 20 February

1965, NOStSKO made the following staterent concerning KoB crypto

logic success during 1960-1961:

"Occasionally the Eignth Directo-

rate would break messages, but very, vory

seldon, and we never saw

the documerts."

(11) Handling of Deciphered Cablis

In mid-1964 NOSENKO was debricied or the procedures used by

the American Deparumeal, during nis reportrd tenuri

1961, in handling ine clear ixt of

decipheard cabies of the u.s.

Embassy.

The report of NOSENKO's staterents on this subject is as

follons: "The Russian text of those Siate Firpartment coded mes-

sages which had been broken was sent to SEllaHASINy, the Chairman

of the KGB, who sometimes forwarded it to Oleg Mikhaylovich GRI-

tions and were of no significarce to nim.

I-frequently there was

mention of the expected arrival of Americans who tre not per-

one such item concerned the arrival of one or two men, a 'commis-

sion,! to check the work of the Political Section.

times expressed on certain unremembered topics, but NOSENKO took

soSEKO noted, however,

that the material con-

All of this material was highly sensitive,

were pernitted to

(iii) Methods of Cryptologic Attack

NOSENKO has twice referred to the Eighth Directorate's

tions picked up by the microphones

in the State Department and

military code rooms.

He said on 21 January 1964:

NOSENKO was more specific with regard to another source of

analytic infornation.

Questioned on 24 January 1964 concerning

recruitment and use of code clerks by the American Departaent,

NOSENKO enumerated the recruitments known to him and then said:

"As I recall, way back in 1948 or 1949,

there was a man of yours

who defected.

He stayed behind.

I believe his name was MeMILLAN.*

The debriefing continued:

Question: But did not 'ANDREY' bring out military code material?

No, I believe it was only State Department material.

code machines and what daily or other periodic settings

(1i) USIB Security Committee Report

"The security practices and procedures. [at the American

Embassyl appear io have followed a pattern

from

April 1953 to

May 1960, at which time the first plastic lacoustical room

was installed.

A change occurred in the work habits lin May

1960) in that the more

senior State Department officers utilized

the plastic roon for

sensitive discussions and dictation.

The

room could acconmodate only a limited portion of the Embassy

classified discussions and,

accordingly, a number of classified

discussions were held outside of this secure

area.

In the April

1953-May 1960 period it was an accepted practice of the Ambassa-

dor and the Deputy Chief of Mission

to discuss openly in their

offices routine classified operations of the Enbassy and to dic-

tate classified documents and telegrams.

Extrenely sensitive

matters such as high-level political decisions, matters perti-

nent to the most sensitive U.s.- Soviet relatzonships and positive

intelligence operations were not dictated and if discussed,

were mentioned in a cryptic manner...

"In the External Political Section during the 1953-1960

period there were daily staff meetings...

Work assignments

were given at these meetings to individual officers who,

in turn,

prepared classified dispatches or telegrams to the (Statel De-

partmerit.. It was reported that the officers of the External

Political Section frequently dictated classitied material, includ-

ing telegrans.

Officers of the Internal

Political

Section generated few classified telegrams...

were, however, typed in the offices.

Fron May 1960 to date [1964)

the Ambassador-DCM operation conducted their most sensitive clas-

sified discussions and actions in the acoustic room; however

routine classified day-to-day operations were discussed and dic-

tated in the offices.

Ambassador KOHLER reported that since

August 1962 he and members of his staff working on substantive

or sensitive matters utilized the secure room and that all ma-

terial to be encrypted was drafted in long-hand or dictated in

the acoustic room.

"The pattern for the External Political Section and the

Internal Political Section remained basically the

same during

the period of May I960 to the present time; however, the most

sensitive matters were discussed or dictated in the acoustic

room. or drafted in longhand...

In September 1962 the second

acoustic room was erected for the typing section for the handi.

ing of sensitive classified material.

From December 1963 to

date it was indicated that no classified telegrams have been

dictated outside of the acoustic rooms. It was

stated, however,

that the day-to-day operations including analysis of develop-

ments within

the Soviet Union were openly discussed in various

offices and the conclusions reached later became the basis of

classified documents or telegrams...

"The military attaches reported that most cables were

drafted

in longhand or typed by the

originator and then turned

over to the code clerks for transmission.

In certain

instances

cables were dictated in the offices..."

Introduction

NOSENKO, as previously indicated, came to Geneva with the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference in mid-March

1962 and established contact with CIA in June of that year.

His arrival in. Geneva and his first meeting with CIA thus

occurred three months and six months, respectively, after

Anatoliy Mikhailovich GOLITSYN defected to CIA from the KGB

Legal Residency in lielsinki, on 15 Lecember 1961,*

and was ex-

filtrated to the United States.

A discussion of what GOLITSYN said about NOSENKO appears in

Part V.I.7.

Presented below are, first, a summary on GOLITSYN,

a survey comparing GOLITSYN's and NOSENKO's leads, and

finally,

a protocol on GOLITSYN which NOSENKC signed.

2 .

Background Information on GOLITSYN

GOLITSYN, a KGB counterintelligence. officer,

the soviet

Embassy in Helsinki in July 1960 under the alias

of Anatoliy KLIMOV.

In defecting to CIa, he provided more than

20 docurents taken from the lielsinki KGB Legal Residency files

as well as extensive information about KCB officers

tions acquired during his 16-jear carear in the KGB.

GOLITSYN had had a variety of job and training assignments

in the First Chief Directorate in Moscow and training assignments

in the Second Chief Directorate.**

The bulk of his career was

spent in work against the American target for the First Chief

Directorate; this was his responsibility in llelsinki and had

also been his principal area of responsibility during his pre-

vious tour abroad, in Vienna from 1953 to 1955.

(In the lat-

ter assignment he had been known

to PetI DERYABIN, who defected

to CIA in 1954, and this was

the reason for GOLITSYN being

assigned to Helsinki under alias.)

Among the GOLITSYN documents was a study of American In-

telligence operations exploiting tourists visiting the USSR,

the so-called "Legal travel program."*** This study, which

rung to sixteen pages in translation, was prepared

lieadquarters and was

sent to the Helsinki Legal Residency under

a cover letter, dated 7 April 1961, which suggested a number

: of steps to be

taken in order to counter such operations.

The study was based on two principal sources:

* According to NOSENKO, GOLITSYN defected on or about 15 janu

ary 1962, after NOSENKO had been reassigned to the Tourist

Department.

** As a result of this service, GOLITSYN was the original

source of numerous leads to

identifiable penetrations

of kestern Governments, including agents with access

to classified information such as William VASSALL (see

Part VI.D.5.b.) anā the French officer in NATO, George

GOLETSYN arguired furcher information

about such operations on at least two occasions, when Second

Chief Directorate officers visited Meisinki

on TDY and either

called on him for support or chatted with him about officers and

operatiors.

a.: Microphones in the U.S. Enbassy

In his visits to the Americar. Departmert GOLITSYN learned

by accident of KGB technical operations against the U.S. Embassy

# NOSENKO denied that GOLITSYN visited the American Department

at any time in 1960.

**Although knowing that GOLITSYN went to the American Depart-

ment in 1961, NOSENKO said that the month was not January

but July, for it was in July that he 'NOSENKO)

was on leave.

GOLITSYN's passport, however, verifies he was in the Soviet

Union in January 1961 and

shows no entries for July of that

in Moscow.

When

asked in April 1962 about the product fron such

operation, GOLIISIN said he had heard about

results rony times,

but the only concrete example he was in a position to give was

the following:

During one of his visits to the American Depart-

ment in 1960" he heard and saw that a report or reports of the

results of audiosurveillance in the U.S.

Enbassy had been lost.

While he was present, the Department Chief ordered all the per-

sonnel to search once nore for

these papers, and ar COLITSYN

stood there they went through ail their files.

GOLITSYN said

he could see that there were many

such reports, each having a red

line on it, which signified that these reyorts wore the property

of that department of the KGB Operational Technical Directorate

(OTU)

which was responsible for making

the installations.

explained that this meant that

Me

the American Department had to re-

turr the reports to that directorate, and this was the reason for

& scarch

being made.

The only office

in the U.S. Enbassy which

was specifically menticned in connection with this search was

that of the Minister Counselor.**

NOSENKO have given mutually confirming information, although

their respective reports do rot alrays cover the same data.

states that he visited tie depart-

ment in December 1960 this passport and CIA

have been referring to this inter visit.

in the offices of the Minister Counsellor at the U.S. Emb-

assy, and he said at that time that he had seen intercept

reports of conversations or dictations by successive Mini-

In 1965 NOSENKO volunteered a story about

che loss of one of

the intercept repcrts which the American

Department had received in 1950 or 1961; he identified it

ag one which recorded the Minister Counsello: giving dicta-

tion.

According to NOSENKO, the American Department was

turned upside down for a month, December, in the search

for

the missing report.

Although the document was never

found, neither the Chief of the American Department nor

O.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, was

subjected to any punishment because the draft from

which

the missing report had

been typed was found to be in the

possession of the second

Department of OrU.

From this the

investigators concluded that the document itself had pro

bably been returned to the OTU and burned, and that in-

advertently no paper had been executed to record its des-

truction.

Leads to Operations Against U.S. Embassy Not Covered by

ROSEMKO

GOLITSYN Icported on six operations against personnel of

the v.3. Embassy

in Moscow which have

not appeared in the re-

porting by NOSENKO. **

These operations are summarized below.

GOLITSYN heard in about 1957 of the recruitment of a female

'employee--"like a secretary"--of the U.S. Embassy:

American girl, she had travelled to Georgia in 1957. There the

KGB placed in her path a KGB agent, a Georgian male.

They be-

gan living together, and this relationship continued ir Moscow

where she was recruited.

GOLITSYN's lead to the American recruited with PREISPREUND! 9

help is equated to STORSBERG on the basis of NOSE:RO's and

PREISFREUND's statements that FREISFREUND participated in no

other operation.

GOLITSYN reported that the target of this

operation was Iccruited: NOSENKO reported that STORSBERG. I€-

jected the KGB appreach.

** By virtue of his position as Deputy Chief of the V.S. Emb-

assy Section in 1960

and 1961, NOSENKU said, he was directly

responsible for knowing of all KGB operations agains: person-

nel at the Embassy ir that period and definitely would have

known of any successes since his earlier tour;

he knew that

"ANDREY" was the last successful one (1953-54).

coming assigment to llelsinki, and SOLITSYN was told that if the

agent was transferred to Helsinki, GRYAZNOV might let GOLITSYN

have him as his agent. GRYAZHOY gave GOLITSYN ro details about

the operation other than the fact that the agent had provided the

KGB with some information and the KGB considered him "a real agent."

Also in the spring of 1960, GOLITSYN learned from GRYAZSOV

that he, GRYAZNOV, had developed an operation against a military

code clerk at the

U.S. Embassy to the point that the KGB was *99

per cent sure" that the target would be recruited.

'From the

accounts given by NOSENKO

and STORSBERG, this does not appear to

concern the STORSPEPG operation, which was just beginnirg at this

NOSENKO has mentioned no other operation against a nilitary

code clerk.

I.Y. KURILENKO told GOLITSYN that while serving in the U.s.

embassy Section he had followed an American diplomat returning

the United States in 1959, and there he had completed the recruit-

ment which had begun while the diplomat was assigned to the u.g.

Embassy in Moscow.*

According to KURILENKO, he had travelled to

the United States under cover of the Soviet Exhibit Committee.

GRYAZNOV informed GOLITSYN in April

or May 1960 that an

sexual acts.

However, SHELEPIN, who had just become Chairman of

the KGB, was stressing ideological rather than blacknail recruit-

ments at this time; SHILEPIN said that this method of approach was

"too dirty" and the KGB should find another way.

SHELEPIN did

not exclude the future use of the photographs, which the KGB would

Another case mentioned by GRYAZNOV to GOLITSYN was that of

the attempted recruitment of an American female secretary on the

basis of her relationship with a KGB agent, either a lover or a

close friend.

The agent, with the help of a KGB officer, tried

to influence her, but failed.

She left the USSR prior to July

1960, but the KGB pianned to work on her again, as she was to

return to Moscow.

On a TDY trip to Helsinki in November 1960, V.V. KOSOLAPOV

of the U.S. Embassy Section told GOLITSYN that he had come there

in order to ride basi. to Moscow on the train with a U.S. Embassy

code clerk with whom he planned to strike up an acquaintance to

be continued in Moscow.**

In about September 1961 a friend of':

KOSOLAPOV's came to Helsinki on TDY, and GOLITSYN tried to get

him to talk about KOSOLAPOV's train operation, but he would not

From this GOLITSYN was certain that the re

cruitment had been successful.

GOLITSYN learned from V.M. KOVSHUK, apparently in January 1961,

that the Finnish agent. Johan PREISFREUND had recently been used in

the successful recruitment of an American at the U.S. Embassy•

NOSENKO has described no

successful operations in which PREISFREUND

took part (see preceding section).

NOSENKO said that there was no operational reason for KURILENKO's

travel to the United States at the time of the Soviet Exhibition

in New York City, and that KURILENKO's duties related only to

security; the KGB Resident in New York City, NOSENKO added, could

have given KURILENKO some special task if he wished.

NOSENKO's Information on GOLITSYN

In February 1965, after he had been questioned by

CIA about GOLITSYN,

NOSENKO signed the

following state-

ment concerning his knowledge of GOLITSYN:

"I have never met or seen Anatoliy Mikhailovich

sations took place at that time.

Since I directly super-

F. Surveillance of Soviets in the United States

1. Information from NOSENKO

At the second meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962, NOSENKO

related that V.A. KOZLOV,

Chief of the American Department

of the KGB seventh (Surveillance) Directorate, had gone to

the United States the year before to investigate the suspected

cessation of surveillance of Soviets stationed in New York City

NOSENKO said at that time:

•e have sensed that something has happened in Anericathere

"We do not feel

surveillance.

The KGB Legal Resident in New York City,

B.S. IVANOV, had reported the situation. to the KGB First Chief

Directorate which,

in turn,' had seught the Second Chief Direc-

torate's opinion as to why

no surveillance was being noted.

Unable to suggest a reason, the Second, Chief Directorate asked

whether the surveillance of Soviets could have been called off

temporarily.

The First Chief Directorate doubted that this

could be the case but did state that radio traffic nornally

used in U.S. surveillance "was not on the air."

KOZLOv con-

sequently was sent to the United States to assess the situ-

ation, and in the course of a month, NOSENKO said, he visited

both New York City and Washington.

KOZLOV discovered not only

that there was no surveillance of

Sovicts but also that "they

dropped our democracies

- Bulgaria,

Rumania, Hungary. They

temporarily took them (surveillance) off."

Also at this meeting NOSENKO conmented that:

- "If your surveillance comes up on the radio, they

(KGB monitors] pick then up everywhere."

The practice of KGB case officers has not to

proceed directly

from a Soviet installation to a meeting

with an agent,

but rather to use other Soviets as decoys

"so that you will think we are working on somebody, where-

as in fact we are not working on them.

was made

on 29 January 1964 during a discussion

of she "ANDREY" case.**

While V.X.KOVSHUK was in the United

States trying to reestablish contact with "ANDREY", NOSENKO

said, he was usually accompanied by two other KGB officers.

KGB monitoring of FBI surveillance communications revealed

that KOVSHUK

and the others*** were referred to by the FBI as

"the Three Musketeers."

through special ap-

While at

COLITSYS said, he
