During the week of 2 July 1978, various files concerning

the above-named individuals were made available for review to

Charles Berk of this committee.

Mr.

Berk has now reviewed

Office of Personnel file, and Volumes One

and Two of AmmuG/l's

recorded interviews conducted by CIA represchtatives with

AMMUC/1 are absent from the files provided thus far to the

Committee.

These twenty-two reels of tape recordings were

listed as attachments to the above-referenced CIA dispatch.

The actual interviews from which the tape

recordings were

generated were conducted shortly after AMMUG/l's defection

from the Cuban Intelligence Service.

Furthermore, three trans-

scripts of tape recorded CIA interviews with AMMUG/1 are absent

from the files thus far provided to the Committee.

transcripts were listed as attachments to a CIA-originated re-

port of 30 April 1964.

The actual interviews upon which the

transcripts are based were also

shortly after AMMUG/l's

defection from the Cuban Intelligence Service.

In the case of Luisa Caldoron's CIA files, CIA informa-

tional reports,

cables, and dispatches referenced to in her

file have been

found to be absent from that file. In addition,

a CIA transcript of a telephone conversation in which she par-

on the day of President Kennedy's assassination is

absent from her 201 file.

The absence of these reports, notes, memoranda, and other

material from the AMMUG/l files and the Luisa Calderon files

reviewed to date may be an indication that other related

materials have not yet been made available to the Committee for

The Committee therefore reiterates its request that all

iles and index references on Luisa Calderon and AMMUG/Je

cluding but not limited to production files,

operational files

tee as soon as possible.

The Committee further requests that AMMUG/1 CIA case

views with Committee staff members.

As some of the matters discussed herein may be of a

sensitive or classified nature, this communication may require

appropriate classification.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

Sincerely,
