The answers to the ARRB questions will be shared with the ARRB staff on Background Use Only basis. An unclassified

memorandum for the record will be prepared by the ARRB for public. A classified version may be prepared and place in secure storage at

National Archives. Information and any documents will not be attributed, to

one proposal is to attribute the

material to the station's files with no date. The Agency will have the opportunity to review the drafts of the memos. To date the ARR

staff have been very responsive to our concerns when preparing these type memos.

Please note that the
