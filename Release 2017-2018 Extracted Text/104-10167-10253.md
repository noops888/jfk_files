It was not set clear whet the Clh role would.

Within a der -nutes ca that con-

comprised of DIN; his vIPe Tania,, Sergio DIZ Bruel, and Carlos ECHECOVEN

his disposition toward cocgeration with US officiais and inteiligence people parti-

warly and to deterine bether or not he was in possession of azy docurents nich

or riews on tine Castro goverment. With the exception of a cozy of the staterent

which he had released to the press prio- to leavirg Cuba, he vas carrying no documents.

I then talked to him about his irmediate plans and he said that se was placing himself

cospletely at the disparal of US Officiais but that de was concerzed about his

crother Marcos and wes höpeful that be sould conceai his whereasots until informa-

tion was avaliable of lances" situation.

I also discussed with sin the erfect trat

the measures being taxen it thet moment to find hin night have a the general

poruiation.

He said tinat ne felt that the impact of these messies would de very

great since it would make te people realize how serious the gore nment there viewed

the resignatica of a senior official oased on charges of Communist tendencies in

the government. In defesence to these feelings on the part of tse subjest and being

at the moment still unsure as to the ultivate hordling of him, is seesed desirable

tuat his prese-@in the l'S not becone public inforcation for the thne velng.

5. I discussed this with AiRES and asted what his Intentions were with

rejard to retetning or releasing the ra-ty. He said that under sormal eicumstances

Bruzie, who 1s an American eitizen, vould be released forthwith ind that the others

would be paroled as soon as the paper sork vas compieted. I poisted out so hin
