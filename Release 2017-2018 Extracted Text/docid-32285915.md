JOSEPH MASSEI (Miami file 92-122) has been at the

Arlington Hotel, Hot Springs, Arkansas, since 10/1/62.

His office at Miami Beach is closed in

his absence.

MM 609-C on 10/11/62, advised as a result of an

FBI inquiry at a printer in Miami, relative to football

parlay cards, HARRY YATES (Miami file 165-26) at present has

no cards. On 10/18/62, this source advised the bookmakers are

puzzled as to why the FBI is interested in the football

parlay cards, since they are printed locally. He stated as

a result of the FBI inquiry the runners who distribute these

cards find the cards harder to secure, even though there are

still readily available cards in this area.

MM 509-C on 10/10/62, advised that on 10/6/62 and

10/9/62, HYMAN MARTIN was driven to and from the Patio

the funds for SOL EDER.

In addition, this sarce related he was told that
