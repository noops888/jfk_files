"DATE:' •11-14-2017

Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to Mrs. Morris, dated 11/21/95

Re: JEK TASK FORCE

DETAILS: On of about 11/28/95, the ARRB will formally advise by

letter to the Director the determinations noted by them on FBI

documents at meetings 11/13 - 14/95.

The ARRB made determinations

on 25 FBI documents.

The JFKTE and the ARRB are in agreement with

he disposition of 18 of the documents, with one document pending

further review.

However, the ARRB will order release of

information in six documents (copies attached with pertinent

information marked) identifying five individuals, described below,

wo who were "Confidential Sources" of the FBI,

one PCI, one PSI,

and one symbol number informant with singular information. The

information to be released is summarized as follows, by document

number:

1.

HQ 62-109060-2981 (page 2), NAR 124-10058-10009,

identifies LA 3436 S as "the

daughter of

McElfresh"

The JEKTE was willing to release the prefix and

suffix of the symbol number and the name of McElfresh to be in

compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act (the

Act) .

The

ARRB determined that the numeric portion of the symbol

number would be upheld, but that the singular identifying

information be released.

In the Letterhead Memorandum, which has

been released in its entirety, McElfresh is interviewed and

identifies

her daughter as Patricia Jane Welch.

JFKTF research

indicates that the daughter is currently living in the same area

with the same identity.

2.

HQ 62-109060-3771, NAR 124-10026-10413, identifies

Brant Coopersmith as a confidential racial source.

The ARRB

determined

this document should be open in full.

A review of his

HO 137-8385 file indicated he was closed in 1965. JFKTF research

through the Butte Information Technology Center (BITC) did not

find any current records on this individual.

3. HQ 62-109060-4526, NAR 124-10058-10086, identifies

PCI George Clark Johnston, who provided information on David

Lewis, a prior roommate.

Mr. Lewis was making claims that he had

names of individuals involved in the Kennedy assassination.

The

ARRB determined this document should be open in full.

A review of

the Headquarters and New Orleans indices and the BITC data bases

did not indicate any records associated with PCI Johnston.

4.

HQ 62-109060-4527, NAR 124-10058-10085, identifies

PCI George Clark Johnston who reported the same information set

out in number 3 above. The ARRB determined this document should

be open in full.

5.

HQ 62-109060-4535, NAR 124-10058-1084, identifies

William S. Morris, described as a confidential source, as
