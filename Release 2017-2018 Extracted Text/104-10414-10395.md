REQUEST FOR RENEMAL

PROJECT ILEMPTY

I.

CURRENT OBJECHN

Ao

AND, RELATED PROJECE ACCOMPLISEMENTS.

The overall objective of the LIEMPTY project activity 1s to collect

operational Information on the LINRICK Installation and personnel, as well

Corollary objectives which ar

to be fulfilled through the use of the LIEMPTY Installations and personnel

are as follows:

1) To provide operational information pertaining to the dally activities

and movements of LIMPRICK personnel, particularly those individuals of

Intelligence interest, as well as Information on the LIMERICK physical

facilities and visitors to the premises.

2) To collect operational Information pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, other official installations, and persons of Intelligence

Interost operating in Mexico.

3) To provide operational support and other protective services to Station

personnel and operations as may be deemed necessary.

Bo The abore objectives are to be fulfilled through the use of the lurtadiue

ITTYRIC, and LICATTA fired Installations, the LIEVIRAP mobile walt, and

services of contract agents Raymond I. GERENDE and Oliver Q. SCANITING. These

objectives are in consonance with and represent partial fulfillment of the

following sections of the current Related Mission Directive as approved for

Nexico City Station:

Prlority A, Section 1, Subsection e

Priority A, Section 2,

, Subsection c

requests and reguirements for coverage of varlous targets falling within the

framework of the above eited objectives and the Related Nission Directive.

Specifle exemples of LIMPlY progress; accomplishments and contributions by

1. IMM

Throughout the reporting period, until operational actlyity was terminated

and the photographic equipment evacuated from the LIMITED basehouse on

26 September 196 (because of security Implications stemming from the

release of the Warren Comission report, see Section II, CHANGES),

the

LINITED Installation provided dally photographic coverage and physical

surveillance of the main gate of LIMERICK Installation during the afternoor

and early evening hours. The Station considers the LIMMED photographic

coverage an essential and reliable tool for following the dally activities

of the target personnel and the arrival and departure of visitors, sone of

whom have been PiRINErs. In adaition,

the LINNeD Installation provided

a fixed: radio dispatch base for the ITEMBRACE team.

Because of the

extremely tight security neasures instituted by the locel securlty forces

in the lmediate veinity of the LINKRICK Installation, stakeouts by the

untlateral survelllance team are precluded. However, with LINTIED

personnel dispatching the tean from positiona removed fron the protective

securttying, onto targeta departing the installation, surveillance

coverage 1s made posal ble.

2) LILYRIC

The IMTyIC installation alsd provided photograpaic and fixad visual sur

veillance of the front of the LINricK installation throughout the period

nder soviet, during the morning and early afternoon hours.

This photo

raphic coverage and the written logs of the movement of LIMERIC

ersamel prepared by LILVRIC personnel, complements the LINUED coverag

sed by the Station in Ita KUDESI operations against the LIMERICK targe

and has. been judged to be of equal quality and value to the LINTED

coverage.

3) LICATTA

The LICATTA Installation continued to provide coverage of the back of

the LIMarIck installation, the garden, and patio ares where many of the

personnel and their families congregate.

This coverage gives the Station

its roal insight into the INRICK target and provides a large part of the

Information on which the Station bases 1ts Identification of LINERICK

staffers, their rank and positions, the staffing estimates, and the

Intelligence cornections of the various officers.

In adaition some

Information of LAURICLE interest 1s provided by LICALLA (ses paragraph 2,

section I of HNMA-24235 dated 2 September 1964 for further details).

4) LIONERAP

A greatly increased use of the IlENIRAP undt was evidenced throughout

the period under revlew. This asset was employed extensively for photo

grephic coverage of PCH Headquarters, the PCH Women's Congress; the homes

of PCM members and the residences of

foreign Communist extles in Mexico.

Nuch of thia coverage was in support of past or planned recruitment

(COxIDE-], prior to the Station's successful recruitment of this kigh-

level PCM member.: The section primarily responsible for the Station's

antI-PCM activity has classified the LIBNIRAP coverage as a most

"valuable" part of their effort.

PEOLO COVERAGE - GENERAL,

196?

During the 9 month period from I November, to 1 August 1964, the LIEMPTY

project produced approximately T70 rolls of operational st1ll photographs,

of which 595 rolls were directly concerned with the LIMERICK target.

This

coverage, linked with the dally logs kept by the basehouse keepers of the

activities of the LIMERICK personnel, while contimally contributing to

the Station's regular CE effort, has been particularly effective during

crisis times such as the GPFLOOR investigations. While the photographic

coverage is used almost exclusively for Station operations in the LIMERICK

aros, ITINPTY has also provided direct support to other operations such as

providing verification of a double agent's visits to the LIMERICK

installation

6) OLiver So, SCANTLING

uring the period 1, December 1963 through 30 August 1964, long-term Station

asset, Oliver &. SCANTING (ps) continued as the cutout to the LINTIED

basehouse, and made his regular contribution as the alternate contact of

IICASA-1 In this sensitive LAURICLE operation.

SCANITING also performed

mmerous pretext investigations, serviced accommodation addresses, and

prepared formal casing reports.

Of particular significance were

SCATTING's regular checks of the accommodation address used in the

sensitive AEINPULSE operation, the thorough Investigation of a former

(SOTH agent of Interest to KUBARK, and detailed casings of the Chinese

Communist Falr.

(See also Section VI, PLANS, for SCANTLING'& future

operational assignment).

7) Raymond E. GERENDE

During the period under review, GERENDE contimed in his assigment as

the Station cutout to the LIIYRIC and LICALIA basehouses, the LIENIRAP

unit and as the processor of the raw photographic take, and with the

assistance of LIEMPIY-10, contized to provide and service the majority

of the accommodation addresses used by the Station.. The contributions

made principally by GERINDE (and to a limited extert by SCANILING) to the

sensitive ARol operation can accurately be described as unique and

essential to the success of that operation. Although this activity is

necessarily & Headquarters directed effort, the local contributions of

GERENDE and SCANILINg are Integral ingredients of thet operation.

Do It will be noted from the above samples of LIEMPTY contributions to the

Station's progress towards fulflllment of the pertinent sections of the

Related Mission Directive,

that notwithstanding their demonstrable value

nd importance, these contributions actually represent only a portion of

the activity directed towards the fulfillment of each objective.

Therefore,

any precise measurement of project progress is precluded.

However, based

on the performance and overall contributions of the LIEMPTY projout during

the past project year, the Station concludes that this project is essential

to the fulfillment of the Related Mission Directive and must be contimed

during the forthcoming project year.

CHANGES

A)

On 24 September 1964, the Station was Informed by Headquarters that a

LiFTy project photograph which was one of several supplied to the Warren

Caniasion In November 1963, would be published in that Commission's formal.

overt report.

Since LINERICK officials would undoubtedly be able to

recognize the indivldual in the photographs as a visitor to their

Installation and with a view towards the attendant possible security problema,

the INTTED, LILYRIC, and LICALIA operations were suspended on 26 and 27

September and all photographic and other compromising equipment was evacuated

from these basehouses. All baschouse personnel were briefed in general on the

situation and speoifically on how to cope with any possible inquirles from

Goversment officiala or LIMERICK Inspired or prompted newamen. Complete

emerzeroy commications systems were arranged for all basehouse persomel,

Raymond H. GRaDE and Oliver G. SCANI.INJ. Upon receipt by the Station of a

copy of the photograph, it was determined that the LINTED basehouse had

provided the photograph in question. This consideration, linked with further

analysts of the linitations upon any counteractions avallable to LIMRICK

officials, alloved the station to re activate the ltyre and MICAnA bases

on a phased basin In early October 1964. However, because LIMMED was the

originitor of the to be publiahed photograph and due to the age and deterio

rated condition of the LINMED property (owned by KUBARK), Station Mexieo

CIty ald not reactivate LIMurD and presented to Headquarters & plan for the

demolition of the present LINID structure with recommendations for the

construction of & new building complex.. (See MEXI 1307 dated 20 October 1964

for additional detalls).

B) In accordance with paragraph 2 of HMMY-12297 dated 28 January 1964, the

value and productlvity of all assets under Project LTEMPIY was closely

revieved against the necessary securty and efficiency reguirements.

It was

deternined that LIKMPIY-12 and LIEMPIY-8 could be terminated ulthout causing

Intolerable gaps in operational coverage or an unacceptable decrease in

efficiency.

Both LIFMPTY-12 and LIEMPIY-8 were terminated on 30 June 1964;

at the same time, In keeping with the ODYOKE economy program, & further effort

was made to reduce the costs of this project by placing LIEMPIY19 on an

hourly rate for work perforned for the Station.

C)

On 30 September 1964, the field Case Officer responsibility for Project

LIEMPTY was transferred from Jeremy I. NIARCOS to Cornellus I. PEUVION;

however, the analysis of the finished take from the photographic basehouses

continues to be performed by Robert B.. RIGGS.

EFFECINENESS

The effectiveness of the LIMPTY project must be judged on the basis of the

rollable dally coverage

provided rapidly and securely for the station and

Interested Headquarters' components on the LIMERICK Inetallation; the rapid

mobile coverage provided regularly by LIENIRAP; and the support to these and

other operations provided by Raymond H. GERENDE and OlIver G. SCANTLING.

(See Section I, Subsection C for specific examples of this effectiveness).

In the opinion of Station officers who use the LIENPIY photographic product or

receive LIMPIY operational support, this project has responded most satisfactorily

to the needs and requirements.

IV. PROBLEMS

A) The only major operational/security problemwhich confronted project LIENPTY

during the perlod under revlew were the security implications steming from the

rolonse of the overt Warren Connission report. (See paragraph II, Section A).

the precise damage occasioned locally by the reporty cannot be measured until

the mid-November release of the report annex containing the actual LIMMED

During the interim period, the emergency contact systems are

have been reviewed and strengthened, and no undue concern has been displayed

by any of the project persamal. Potential Station countermeasures to the

possible LIVERICK resction to the publication of the subject photograph were

outlined In NEXT 1013 dated 25 September 1964.

No umsual personnel problems have arlien and the overall performance of all

agents cornected with this project has been satisfactory.

Va. LIAISON AND INTERAGENOY COORDINATION

Not applicable.

VI. PLANS

A) The future of the LINTED basehouse, property and personnel will be determined

within the near future.

(See Section 2, subsection a). Station has acquired

another apartment on a temporary basis in the IlYRiC complex to replace the

loss of LINED coverage and It will be activated after the acquisition and

clearance of basehouse keepers.

B) No basic changes are contemplated in elther the admiriistration or operation

of the LICALLA or LYRIC bases.

coverage of selected LIMKRICK personnel engaged in conversation in the

garden area in an attempt to obtain f1lm which will lend itsele to lipreading

by Headquarters' speclalists.

C) The Station plans to maintain the increased level of LIDYIRAP operational

activity, with this asset being targetted in the near future against the

Pertido Popular Socialista (PPS) In support of the Station's new PPS

penetration progran.

D)

Effective on 1 September 1964, Raymond H. GERENDE assumed the cutout role

and responsibility for the LINITED basehouse in addition to his other

operatioal duties outlined in Section I.

No other basic operational or

administrative changes are planned for GERaNDE for the ensuing perlod.

E)

The renoval of Oliver G, SCANILING as the cutout to the LINIED basehouse

was a result of the recent death of his wife, his pending trip tol

7 and the Station's desire to give

more operational responsibility to Raymond F. GERENDE. After SCANTING's

return from Japan, he will assume operational duties and responsibilities in

an activity not connected with Project LIEMPTY.

Therefore, salary and

operational expenses for SCANTLING are programmed for six montha only.

F) Other than presented above, Mexico City Station plans no other significart

project changes since it 1s felt that this project is now operating at its

optim size. Justification for the retention of three basehouses was

presented 1n deta11 In EMA-23343: (which 1s avallable at Headquarters).
