File

DATE: 14 January 1950

FROM

Chief, Alien Affairs Staff

SUBJECT:

Timigration and laturalization Service, Relations with

(siami, Florida)

1.

it 2:00 pom. this date, Mr. Richard Haberstroh, Intelligence

Officer, IiiS, telephonically contacted the writer. He stated that

se in tur nad received a telephone call from Ed Ahrens, the Inmigra-

tion District Director in Miari, which referred to arrangements which

had been laid on during 1959, whereby Cubans of interest to this

Agency would be smuggled out of Cuba aboard a boat destined for

Tampa, Florida.

Nir. Ahrens indicated to Mr. Haberstroh that apparently

the Cubars have becone suspicious of the vessel, and the boat owner 1s

in "hot water" in this regard. According to Mr. Haberstroh, the CIA

representative in Miami was contacted by the boat oner's attorney

with the suggestion that a letter be obtained from the INS indicating

that they inspected the vessel on its several arrivals at Tarpa and

that it carried no passengers.

2.

Mr. Haberstroh stated that his quick reaction is that the

Service cannot comply with such a request. I informed MI. Maberstroh

that ir. Ahrens should be informed that he should take no action in

regard to this matter and inform the CIA representative in Miami that

his superiors in Washington would be in contact with hin in regard to

this matter.

Croan Desk,

not avare of this most recent development, however, he dia mention

that the boat in question has, in fact, beer inpoundeù in Cuba

since Decenver 1959. He went on to point out that we want to io

everything we ca. to help out the owner of the vessel since the

cause of her trouble vas in acceding to our requests io extiltrate

inûivicuals.

4. II.

I readily airitted that the limigration service

should aou have been requested to provide such a lettei, and be

doubted that Zemie Reichardt would have made such a request. Mr.

stated that he sill telephonically contact Reichardi

and get the complete story. He will keep the writer advised.

Innigration Service for the paroling into the United States of
