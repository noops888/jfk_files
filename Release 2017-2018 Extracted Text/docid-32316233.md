Subsequently, an unidentified man was observed

with the subject

and PETER A. MAGADDINO and in whispered

conversation was heard to ask PETER A. MAGADDINO for $1,000.

The subject and this man then engaged in a whispered, con-

versation which was not audible to the informant.

Later

when news of the assassination of President

agreed that the routine of the employees at the funeral

parlor is known.
