In his letter to the HSCA and in his oral testimony, Bagley

mentioned CIA's possession of ta Secret KGB document concerning

disinformation.

"This document was received many years ago from

an East European intelligence officer defector.

Therefore, we

cannot make a strong case for deleting reference to it, although

we wish that Bagley had not mentioned it.

I understand from your conversation with Rodger that you would

welcome a letter from the Agency, on this section of the report,

for inclusion with it in the final report. Could we have more

details?

Very truly yours,

S. D. Breckinridge

Principal Coordinator, HSCA

Dear Bob:

Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains

under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover,

which he has not moved to have modified.

To expose his true

matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status. It remains

classified.

We therefore request that the example set in the

Hart testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy

Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft.

Following are detailed comments:

NOSENKO

:.

Testimony of Nosenko

Page 1, lines 15 and 18. KGB agents should read KGB officers.

Page 2, lines 3 through 20. Deryabin and Golitsyn are identified

here for all intents and purposes (except by name.). Suggest the following

rewrite:

• 6. "

There were factors, however, that limited,the valué

of the information

i supplied to the Committee by these:

ex-KGB officers: 1) neither had been assigned to the

Same KGB Directorate as Nosenko, and 2) one of them had

information about the KGB that was outdated.

" "Introduction, Page 3." dr

Change the first sentence"of the last para-

graph to read "The first individuals interviewed by the Committee

were two former KGB officers."

Page 3, line 13. Change "agents" to "officers."

MARTHA!
