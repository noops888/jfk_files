SUBJECT: DAVID LEE HORN

845 West 30th Street

Independence, Missouri

INFORMATION CONCERNING

On 5-19-71 a letter was received from captioned individual in which he

advised the Director that he wished to file a formal complaint against Special

Agents James P. Hosty and Kenneth Brookhout (SA William G. 'Brookhart) of the

Kansas City Office for behavior unbecoming agents of the FBI. He states the com-

plaint is based on their actions, statements, offers of money, threats, and

coercive actions.

SAC, Kansas City, has advised that above allegations against Bureau

personnel are completely without basis. Horn is a white male, born 8-30-44 at

Independence, Missouri, is a student at the University of Missouri, and resides at

845 West 30th Street, Independence.

He was a Panel Source of the Kansas City

Office 8/69 to 12/69 when closed for lack of production and upon determination that

he could not furnish sufficient information to justify retention. In 7/70 Horn was

suspected of having made threatening telephone calls to a Kansas City area resi-

dent. This matter was handled under the Extortion classification and prosecution

was declined by the United States Attorney since the origin of the calls could not

be determined.

SAC advises it has been ascertained through reliable sources that Horn

was involved in an automobile accident in the summer of 1970 wherein he sustain-

ed severe brain damage. Since this accident, he has been acting strangely and

according to his father, John M. Horn, he has periodically lapsed into periods of

extreme mental deficiency. SAC notes that Horn has not been interviewed by

agents of the Kansas City Office in over a year, and was never paid or offered pay

for services during the time he was a Panel Source. In view of Horn's mental con-

dition and the fact that his allegations are obviously without foundation, SAC rec-

ommends no further action.

RECOMMENDATION: That Horn's letter not be acknowledged and no furthe

action be taken. Appropriate Divisions are beino furnished copies of this hemo-

randum for information in the event Horn should again contact the Bureau 080
