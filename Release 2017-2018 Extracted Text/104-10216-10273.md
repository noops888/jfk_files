Action Required: FYI.

1. OPFRATIONAL ACTIVITY

A. Preparations were underway in carly November to

dispatch ANTRUNK 13 to Madrid in mid-November to cement

the recruitment of AKTEUNK-19.

These plans fell

through when the ladrid Station notifled Headquarters

and WAVE thet their workload would not allow sufficlent

case officer time to handle AXTEUNK-13 In Hadrid at this

WAVE agreed to postpone ATUNk-13's trip to

Madrid evernl weeks until

Station's workload

abated sonewhat.

B. The prospects of Iinalizing the recruitment of

ALTRUXX-19 increased however with the receipt at WAVE

of another open letter from AMTRUNE-19, this one

mailed fron Mexico City in mid-November. In ASTRUNK-19'g

first letter, nailed from lontreal in nid Octobor, he

surrested usin a friend in lexico City as a cut-out to

Initlate a channel of communications between hinself and

ANTRUNE 13.

In his second lotter, ANTRUN.19 stated

that be had made the necessary arrangements with his

friend in Mexico.

Although WAVE,

Headquarterg and MEXI

traces on AXTRUNK-19's friend, IDEN A, were fragmentary,

Mexico Station stated that IDEN A was well-known to one

of Its PBRUMEN asgets who vouched for IDEN A's loyalties.

WAVE intends to send an innocuous letter to AUTRUXX-19 1n

ANTRUNK-13's handwriting to keep the channel with A-19

alive. ATRUNK-19 appears eager to see ANTRUNK 13 agaln

and has stated in both letters that he has considerable

Information to discuss in detail. It is well realized

that this open letter channel is far fron ideal but it

I8 hoped that in early January 1965 ATRUNK-13 can re

contact ATRUNK-19 and provide him with a systen of S/?

water and which could be more easily canouflaged.

bagc reason for this decision was the fact that

ber through February are the low water months in tho

BCagOD, the heavier, wider V-20 can only be used in the

deoper and sore heavily-guarded infiltration canals.

Through the combined efforts of NICE 14, the ANTrUNK

It is hoped that by March 1965

one or more of these candidates will be trained and pre
