admitted

to him implication in the transportation of

guns stolen at Canton,

Oh10. MEROLA told KAY that he has

an alibi which consists of a telegram. KAY said that

MEROLA indicated that the plane had made one stop en route

to Pittsburgh.

On March 21, 1959, MEROLA told SA LEMAN L.

STAFFORD on a confidential basis that "CAPPY" is the

nickname for one of ROTHMAN's sons.

It is to be noted

that the name "CAPPY" figures in some of the telephone

calls placed from ROTHMAN's and MEROLA's telephone.

On March 12, 1959, PCI ARTHUR W. MILLER,.

formerly was manager of the

new Garden of Allah Motel,

Miami Beach, Florida, advised SA C. GRAHAM HURST that

prior to November, 1958, when the present owner of the new

Garden of Allah Motel took over that motel, the person

claimed to be the owner was MAURICE "RED" POLLOCK who

resided in Rooms 108 and 109 in the motel. MILLER sald

story told is that POLLOCK's aunt, IRENE RUDINGER, who

also resided at the motel, invested her life savings,

maybe $50,000.00 or more, in the motel, but POLLOCK, to

all appearances, was the

owner.

MEROLA, who, with his family, resided in rooms 313 and

314 in the new Garden of Allah Motel when he lived there,

also indicated around that he owned a share in the new

Garden of Allah Motel, and MILLER said he never heard

POLLOCK deny this.

PCI MILLER said that during the later

days of his stay at the new Garden of Allah Motel, CHESTER

GRAY and his

wife resided in room 317.

PCI MILLER stated that "RED" POLLOCK and his

aunt are presently residing on Alton Road, Miami Beach,

he believes number 1s 6356, but not sure, but 1s sure

2-8645; CHESTER GRAY has moved

to his house at 5386 Alton Road; and JOSEPH MEROLA 1S

presently residing with his family in rooms 61 and 62

at-

the old Garden of Allah Motel (just south of the new

motel), although MEROLA told PCI on March 12, 1959, that

his, MEROLA's, house at 2018 North Bay Road 1s almost ready

for occupancy.

PCI-said he takes this with a grain

of salt, as MEROLA has told him in the past he was

ready to move in his house and did not do 1t.

PCI stated that JOSEPH MEROLA did pay rent for

his rooms in the new Garden of Allah Motel.

However,

his payments were spasmotic.

said the payments

made by MEROLA were recorded in the follo for room 313,

and also on the cash sheet in the A and D Book:

PCI MILLER said he himself would probably be the one

to testify in a court of law regarding entries in the

new Garden of Allah Motel books, under the ownership of

MAURICE POLLOCK, which entries would reflect room rent

that he does not know where the records are at present for

the new Garden of Allah Motel, under the ownership of

POLLOCK, unless they are in the custody of JOHN NICHOLAS,

Miami telephone FR3-8125, as NICHOLAS represented the

U. S. Government while the new Garden of Allah MotelÂ®

was in the hands of the receivers during the latter days

of ownership by POLLOCK.

Examination of records of the Southern Bell

Telephone and Telegraph Company on December 17, 1957,

in connection with investigation of thecase entitled,

"CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, ET AL.; EMP - CUBA; NM; RA"

reflected that the subscriber to JE1-1352 1s MORRIS FISHER,

owner Vendome Hotel, which is non-published telephone

located at the penthouse apartment of the Vendome.

Examination of long distance telephone toll slips at

that time reflected that CARLOS PRIO and members of his

family utilized this telephone exclusively.

On March 3, 1959, records of the Southern Bell

Telephone

and Telegraph Company, Miami Beach Branch,

made available by Mrs. JANET SUMMERS, were also examined

with

reference to UNion 6-8545, this

being the non-published

telephone listed to Mrs. JEAN MANNARINO, 8919 Dickens

Avenue, Surfside, which 1s billed to GABRIEL MANNARINO, 540

Charles Avenue, New Kensington, Pennsylvania.

There were

no calls

from October 1, 1958, through January 11, 1959,

charged to this telephone.
