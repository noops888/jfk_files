Note for: John Pereira

Subject:

Meeting with Marwell 4/2/97

Topics discussed:

1. Extension

Marwell says the extension request is going well. The

Board is fully funded in the President amended budget

does not see the need for a letter from CIA at this time;

may need one later for Congress.

2. Name issue

Marwell did not discuss the name issue with the Board;

their time was dominated by the Zapruder Film issue (the

open hearing was on CSPAN). He plans to include our

р. до рата

proposal as part of his "new approach" package.

His pitch

to the board

wilt be that the only way to complete the

review of the sequestered collection is to change the

current system.

He will propose a comprehensive plan that

includes not only procedural changes (how we handle the

documents) but how substantive issues are addressed.

The "new approach" will be addressed at the April 23-24

We should have a final memo to him prior to that

Marwell is re-reading the draft (copy attached)

today and may provide additional comments.

We have agree on the specific of the new procedures

including using number codes for substitute language.

ARRB

staff will prepare a "test package" for next Board meeting.

4. Completion of Sequestered and Core collections

Marwell is telling the Board that with the new approach

they will be able to complete the review.

He sees his staff

greatly increasing the amount of time they will be spending

on reviewing documents plus he plans hire additional people.

He asked if it would be possible to have a statement/letter

(MOA?) of commitment to completing the project by end of FY

1998.

He was a little vague on what he had in mind,

however, it is clear he is concerned

about completing the

review of the sequestered collection.

I told him that I believed the review of the

sequestered

collection could be completed by October

1998 if

most of the "non-relevant"

microfilm material is designated

NBR (not believed relevant)

and we do not have to index each

document. However, I said we

could not make the same

commitment to completing the

"additional information /

records" requests and that these requests could slow down

the review of the sequestered collection.
