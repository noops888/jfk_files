3) For the Bureau's information, CG 6457-PC has

established contact Chicago Division professing extreme disgust

with

GIANCANA plus a willingness to accept many instructions given to

her by the Bureau that will ultamately cause GIANCANA's incarceration.

CG 6457-PC is a former paramour of GIANCANA who advised she has

recently come to the conclusion that GIANCANA ordered the

execution of her former boy friend, one ANGELO FASEL. Informant

advised GIANCANA of opinion he is father of her fourth child

chitmant

while in reality, this child was fathered by FASEL. Informant

contemplates re-establishing contact with GIANCANA using fourth

child's current illness as lever, to obtain finances and other

type help from GIANCANA. Claims prime objective is to learn

if GIANCANA actually executioner of FASEL and while doing so,

Will make available to Chicago livision all intomation relative

to activities, contacts and associates of GIANCANA.

Investigation being conducted to determine

possibiletLMRA violation on Chicago top hoodlum EDDIE VOGEL in

reference to several vending operations under his control.

Every opportunity will be explored through review of books and

records relating to this vending operation to connect VOGEL and

GIANCANA.

VOGEL's enterprises consist of Apex Amusement

Service Corporation, Deluxe Cigarette and Vending Service

Corporation and Ajax Juke Box Corporation. These company

records recently reviewed by Internal Revenue Service in effort

to build case against GUS ALEX, Chicago top hoodlum who is

listed as an employee of two of these companies.. VOGEL has

commonly been referred to as the "Slot Machine King" of Cook

County and his

tax teturns reflect source of income from above

three companies and other income from an individual proprietorship

only described as Coin Operated Machines.

Internal Revenue

Service has requested records concerning this proprietorship

to verify various reductions.

VOGEL has refused access to

these records and Internal Revenue Service intends to make

several adjustments.

It is believed that this individual

proprietorship is probably source of money split with GIANCANA

probably from slot machines and pin ball machines in State

of Illinois. VOGEL has indicated tot CG 6486-C, presence of
