DATE: -11-14-2017

On March 18, 1964,

the matter of obtain-

ing a copy of the document which re NY airtel indi-

cates as pertaining to a confession made to the Italian

Police in 1937 by a certain Dr. MELCHIORRE ALLEGRA of

Castelvetrano, Sicily, was discussed with Dr. MICHELE

GAMBINO, Vice Questore, Palermo Police Department,

Palermo, Italy. Dr. GAMBINO stated that he would make

every effort to attempt to locate a copy of this docu-

ment.

Dr. GAMBINO was also asked to make available

any other material which he might have which would be

of assistance to the Bureau in its understanding of

the make-up and development of the captioned matter.

Dr. GAMBINO promised that he would search his files

for any such information which might be pertinent and

of value.

Dr. GAMBINO was also informed of the

intestions of this office in attempting to locate

NICOLO GENTILE".

Dr. GAMBINO promised to promptly

furnish any pertinent information which may come to

his attention concerning GENTILE.

As the Bureau is aware,

this office main-

tains frequent contact with Dr. ARISTIDE MANOPULO,

Central Bureau, Criminal Division, Italian National

Police, Rome, and has repeatedly restated our interest

in locating GENTILE for interview.

To date, however

the Italian Police have been unable to locate GENTILE.

Dr. MANOPULO is being urged again to make

all possible efforts to locate GENTILE, including

possible contact with the publishers of GENTILE's

book, "Vita di Capomafia", who may be aware of his

present whereabouts.

This office also maintains frequent con-

tact with representatives of the Bureau of Narcotics

who are attached to the American Embassy in Rome and

who also have alerted all of their sources concerning

NICOLO GENTILE.

The Bureau of Narcotics representatives

have advised that

they will promptly notify this office

should they receive any information concerning the

whereabouts of GENTILE.
