MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: "American Defectors to the USSR®*

Lo The attached material was part of a soft file entitled

"American Defectors to the USSR", which was set up by SR/6

(Support) around 1960 and maintained by varlous SR components

until ca. 1963.

The compilations were derived from a variety

of sources, and contain both classified and overt data.

2. In the fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CI

In most instances, basic information was then abstracted

for the US Defector Machine Program.

In all instances in which

the material was unigue, or represented a valuable collation effort,

It has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with

& copy of this memorandum.

It le suggested that any dissemination of this data should

be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), In

view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that

disseminations have already been made through the US Defector

Machine Program.
