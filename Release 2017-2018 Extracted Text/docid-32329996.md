accompanied by Paul(HUGHES (see. Appendix A) left Biscayne Bay near Miami

to keep a rendezvous with a fast P.T. boat, the ALADINO, at Mira por vos

Cays about fifteen miles southwest of Castle Island lighthouse.

Island is immediately south of Acklins Island in the Bahamas).

The ALADINO is believed to belong to Rolando MASFERRER a

supporter of the ex-Batista government in Cuba.

This vessel, with

twenty-seven anti-Castrolrevolutionaries on board, had left Miami at

the same time as the SUNSPORT.

The Captain was a Cuban called

GONZATEZ-PADRON and the engineer another Cuban MARRERO-ORIEGA (See

Appendix A).

The original intention was that the ALADINO should go

straight to Cuba and then return to the Castle Island rendezvous where

she would be refuelled from the SUNSPORT.

Owing to incompetent navigation

she ran aground several times on her outward journey through Bahamas waters

and ran out of fuel.

By the time ATADINO reached Castle Island lighthouse

on about 1st October her engines were in poor condition and it was not safe

for her to, proceed any further.

The invasion party of twenty-seven men

transferred to the SUNSPORT and on about 4th October were landed at a

point one and a half miles southeast of Baracoa light in Oriente Province,

Cuba where according to WILLIAMS they were given a hearty welcome by the

The SUNSPORT then returned to Castle Island and found that the

ALADINO had gone aground hear the lighthouse,

the anchor having broken..

She is likely to become a total wreck.

After a day's delay GONZATEZ and

MARRERO were taken aboard the SUNSPORT with five carbines, one rifle and

twenty-two rounds of assorted 30, •38 and •45 ammunition

which did not fit

According. to HUGHES these weapons were withdrawn from the invasig

party (who were armed with carbines, rifles and revolvers) because of their

doubtful serviceability.

The SUNSPORT then set course for Nassau but as she was running

out of fuel put in to Georgetown, Great Exuma where she arrived on 7

By this time the Bahamas police had got wind that something was

going on and the four men were taken into custody.

Hivered to the twenty-seven men in Cuba.

He said he had the promise of

800 sten guns from some sympathisets in South America to help further

invasions of Cuba and that he intended to operate off the Cuban coast with

a boat about the size of the ATADINO but which was more economical in fuel.

HUGHES alleged that the U.S, authorities boarded the ALADINO after she left

Miami but asked no questions about the large number of men on board, declined

to search for arms, and wished them good luck and allowed them to proceed.
