Source interviewed this date and advised DAVE.

WENGER tad him he is flying to Chicago this date and may

personally

see the judge who is handling the Teamsters Grand Jury investigation

in Chicago.

WENGER said "it looks like we have a chance to settle

thing."

WENGER did not tell

the source what plane he was

leaving on or where he would be staying in Chicago; however, source

advised that WENGER usually stays at the Edgewater Hotel or

Palmer

House in Chicago. This information was telephonically furnished to

the SAC, Chicago, this date.

It was pointed out to Chicago that it appears that

the contact with the judge "belongs" to ALAN ORFMAN as set out

previously by this office in NY airtel to the Bureau 4/19/63.

Information concerning DORFMAN's relationship with the judge

made known to the Chicago Office.

Since there is no indication that

WENGER has a contact with this judge and because of the questionable

reliability of contacts at the Edgewater Hotel and surveillance

problem at the Palmer House, it was agreed that the most logical

approach in this matter is a loose surveillance with proper precau-

tions taken on ALAN DORFMAN.

Chicago advised that a loose surveillance

Of DORFMAN is being instituted.

Chicago was also advised that

through the source they will be notified upon the return of

WENGER to New York.
