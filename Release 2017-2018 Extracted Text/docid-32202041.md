Mr. Parrott outlined broadly three (or as Mr. Dulles later

Tie emphasized tat ine

latter had just come up and that we are now in the process of assessing

the bona fides and capabilities of the individual.

The Group agreed that the action contemplated is very much

in order. MI. Gray commented, however, that his associates had

expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessity for very

straightforward action in this situation, and he wondered whether

the plans as outlined were sufficient to accomplish this. Mr. Dulles

replied that he had taken the comments referred to seriously and had

or requires, but added that he must necessarily put himself in a

Mr. Merchant commented that the Catholic Church in Black

Africa is not a very substantial force. Mi. Dulles concurred in this,

but added that this would be something to keep in mind as appropriate.
