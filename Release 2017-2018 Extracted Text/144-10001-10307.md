In view,' of this and

Minister or Speaker of the National Assembly or Minister:

Chiéf of Protocol, to give prestige and political

importance to your representation.

sure a ministerial representation at his burial would be greatly

appreciated by Mrs. KENNEDY and the administration and further

strengthen good relátions between

I should be most relieved if you would graciously and

favorably consider my suggestion.
