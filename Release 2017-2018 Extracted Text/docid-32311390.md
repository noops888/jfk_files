subject could not have undertaken the assassination of

President Kennedy alone.

As was noted in paragraph 3, page 2, of Mexico City

letterhead memorandum dated 3/16/64, MORA did not divulge her

source of her information regarding the impression of OsWALL

EX-19 hAuericans in the Soviet Union.

Since MEX-18 and

heard MORA make the statement previously tha

she has corresponded with MARY LOUISE PATTERSON, who has been

residing in the Soviet Union, it is these informants' belief

that PATTERSON is the source

there.

EEX-I8 and NEX-I have advised that they hope to

determine from MORA further details regarding her previous

statements about OSWALD.

From information whichkvEX-18 and MEX-19khave

learned

about MORA becoming a Mexican citizen, it is considered

that if MORA were interviewed, she would be antagonistic

if any

Mexican police attempt to at any time interview her,

they are going to run into

If she were to be

interviewed by the Mexican police or by any representative

of the United States Government, there are no grounds to

believe that she would be cooperative in any manner and the

that she has told only MEX-18 and

this would expose these informants.

It is noted that*MEX-18 and MEX-1Khave advised

that they are unable to ascertain information from MORA

through direct questions.

Whenever a question is made

to

MORA, she ceases talking, and the only manner. in which these

informants are able to ascertain data from MORA is to needle

her, then sit back and with

a sympathetic ear listen to what

she

has to say.

MEX-18 and MEX-19 intend to learn from MORA addi-

tional details in order to answer the pertinent questions

which have arisen, and they intend to pursue vigorously the

objective set forth for them concerning any information MORA

has in her possession concerning OSWALD. To date these

informants have not been able to meet with MORA for a two

or three day period because of her illness and her other

preoccupations. Present plans are for them to take MORA

lAn a two or three day "vacation" in the first half of April."

As soon as these informants have met with MORA, this will

be reported immediately, and recommendations will be made

as to any additional investigative steps to be taken.# *(U)

The reason for Mexico City letterhead memorandum

dated 3/16/64, being classified "SECRET" is being detailed

fully as follows:

he letterhead memorandum was classified "SECRET

who are informants in MexiCo

furnishing highly sensitive information involving espionage

and information vital to the internal security of the United

States.

It is essential that the identities of these informants

be fully protected, especially since they are the only source

which received the information and MORA is not known to have

discussed the information in the letterhead memorandum with

anyone else. Under the circumstances,

the protection of these

informants is of paramount interest to the continued operations

of the Bureau in Mexico, and for thir

memorandum was

classified "SECRET."

This office will continue to directfvEX-18 and

MEX-19Kto vigorously pursue their proposed contact with MORA

and the results will be promptly reported to the Bureau.
