Re:

John Cesar GROSSI

On October 14, 1964 CecilCHERNICK, 32 Wasdale

Crescent

Toronto,/ was interviewed at his place of employment,

Abe's Meat market,

3195 Bathurst Street, Toronto.

CHERNICK

is our FPS No. 561937, born March 10g dilLi

He advised that

he met GROSSI in prison and has seen him on about two occasions

since his release in 1957. He admits receiving a cheque from

GROSSI's wife and stated that he forwarded it to GROSSI at

General Delivery, Daytona Beach, Florida. CHeRnior Claims

GROSSI was in Toronto approximately two months ago, which

would be the latter part of July or early August 1964.

that time, according to CHERNICK, GROSSI was driving a 1903

maroon Grand Prix Pontiac bearing unknown Texas licence

plates.

When leaving he told CHERNICK he was going to visit

his wife in Ottawa, Ontario. CHERNICK said he has not seen

GROSSI since that time and when asked if he would advise us.

if he learned of GROSSI's whereabouts, CHERNICK declined,

stating he would not inform on anyone

but assured us that

he did not know his present location.

2.

A check of the usual sources in Toronto and area

were negative. The Ontario Provincial Police have circularized

the description of the Cadillac and the Pontiac Grand Prix

automobile.

To assist us in conducting additional inquiries,

it 1s requested that you supply one additional copy of your

original request which was received here with your referral
