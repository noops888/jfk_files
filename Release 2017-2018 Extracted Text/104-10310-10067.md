grapholos.

uncle

Hayes Gorey of Time is writing a piece on Oswald.

He finds in the Warren Commission report a letter

from Helms to Rep. Rankin. . It is exhibit 2774, The letter

but that the Agency will dig still further to clarify this

This has to do with the passage of Oswald from London

to the Soviet Union, I gather.

Mr. Gorey's query is:

Was the digging done? What did it show?

Is there anything we can do to help Mr. Gorey.

Oswald Flight Inquery by Time Magazine

Pursuant to Mr. Thuermer's request to provide

Mr. Gorey of Time magazine information on Agency efforts

a message was received

1964, which reflected

on 10 October 1959.

It was FINNAIR Flight 852 which

arrived Helsinki at 2333 hours.

passed on July 1, 1964 to Representative Rankin. Efforts

to ascertain if there were other more circuitous flights

that date were explored without apparent
