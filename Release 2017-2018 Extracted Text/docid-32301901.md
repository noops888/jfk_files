on the extortion matter in Hallandale, informat met with .

FRED FELICE and JIMMY DEE at the latter's réstaurant on

mouthing off to the FBI." FELICE referred in particular

to Agents FARRELL and HILL and reminded DEE that he had

been told that DEE had attempted to heap abuse on the

Agents.

to it that you are going to jail."
