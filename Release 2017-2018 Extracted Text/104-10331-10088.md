Dear Me. Lake:

No other ethic is as well-established and as

essential to the success of the intelligence community

as

the prosection of intelligence sources and methods and

thc

safeguarding of confidences.

The effectiveness of the U.S.

Coverament's intolligence and counterintelligence programs

is signiticantly accributable co che historical commitment

by the agencies which coduct these activities to those

principles.

Disclocure of chu identities of sources has

had and may be expected to have a profound effect upon the

ability of the intelligence agencies to obtain the

zonfidential assistance of persons whose cooperacion is

dependent upch assurance o continuing confidentializy.

Similaxly.

the disclosure of information about intelligence

sources and methods has caused and will prediccably resuls

in Che development of countermeasures which will arfect the

ability of the United Scates to provide the President wich

timoly and high-qualicy intclligence and detect and address

hostile incelligence activitles directed against the

United Scaces.

The agencies represented by the National Counter-

intelligence Policy Board unanimously chare, and hereby

express, their concera that these tundamental principles could

be compromised by an inappropriate commitment to disclosure

by the Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) in

ics administzation of the John E. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act.of 1992 (the Act).

DRAFT UTTER I0 ANTHONY LAKE.

NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCTI

Honorable Anthony Lake

To date, the response by the intelligence agencies

to Board roguests for the release of documents has been

unprecedented.

The Federal Burcau of Investigacion (FBI), for

examole, has released over 613,000 documents to the National

Archives and Records Adainistration and has requested that

disclosure be postponed with respect to portions of only 4.37

percent of chose documents.

The FBI has sought postponement

with respect to limited portions of that modent number of

records based upon expressed concern by foreign governments

which contributed or originated the information and reluctance

to reveal the identities of intelligence assets or intelligence

sources and mechods.

ine!!

The Act permits the postponement of disclocure upon

prosentation of clear and convincing evidence that the theat

to the military defense,

intelligence operations, Of foreign

relations of the United

States posed by public disclosure

outweighs the public interose in disclosure and that such

disclosure would reveal:

(A)

an intelligence agent whose identity currently

requires protection: or

(3) an intolligence source or method which is

curzontly utilized, or reasonably expected to be

ucilised, by the United States Goverhment and which

has not been officially disclosed, the disclosure of

which would interiere with the conduce of intelligence

activities.

(Sea Acs, Sections 6(1) (A, 3) )

The Act further permits the postponement of

disclosure upon a showing, by clear and convincing evidence,

that public disclosure would compromise

the existence of an

understanding of confidentiality currently regulzing protecziod

between a goveinment agent and a

coopcrating ind.vidual ora

foreign goverment, and public disclosure would be

so banniul

that it outweighs the public interest.

AcE, Section 6(4))

DRAET LETTER TO ANTRONX LAKR

Honorable Anthony Lake

NATIONAL, SECURTTY COUNCIL

The Board's rejection of postponements proposed

under thece Sections of the Act dismisses che fact that the

incelligence agencies are uniguely qualified to assess che hamm

to intelligence operations which would result from disclosure

ot the identities of intelligence assets of revelations about

intelligence sourcos and methods. It remains essential that

the U.S. govezanent stand by assurarces to persons and foreign

goveroments that information they provide on the basis of those

assurances will remain confidential for as long as is necessary

to protect those persons or govemments.

It is similariy

essential that sources, methods, and technigues which have

bad value in the past and could

be expected to have value in

the future not be compromised. To require disclosure of the

identities of intelligence assets or revelation of souices

and methods, including the confidential cooperation of

forcign goverrments, would enervate u.S. intelligence and

counterintelligence programs and discourage che confidential

coopezation on which the successful conduct of effective

intelligence is dependent.

The intelligence community believes

that the harm which would result from such disclosures would

demonstrably impair the national security of the United States

and that the clear and convincing evidence standard does acc

require that it divine, with absolute precision, the specific

manner in which that harm will arice.

The National Counterintelligence Policy Bcard

Iospectfully requests, thercfore, that these concerns be

bought to the attencion of the Board and chat the position

of the intelligence conmunity with respect to the disclosure

of intelligence asset identitied and intelligence sources and

methods be considered in any subscquent review or final

determinations by the Board.

Respectfully yours,

Nora Slackin, Chairperson

National Counterincelligence

Policy Board
