SCIARRA has a friend who has been making

• telephone calls from his home telephone number 401-274-

1870.

Informant believes that the individual calling from

the SCIARRA telephone is some hoodlum from Boston or some-

one who is connected with the Boston LCN faction.

section of the ACI as CALLEI and for this reason no at-

tempts to murder CALLEI are to be made on SCIARRA's

authority.

SCIARRA indicated to T-l that CALLEI Wi11

eventually be murdered.

I-I learned through sources at

the ACI that SCIARRA is attempting to remove himself from

the minimum section into the maximum security section

where PRO VERNER is located.

SCIARRA commented one time

that everyone has deserted LERNER and he wants to continue

maximum security section

T-1 advised

that JERRIXOUIMETTE is spending a considerable amount of

time with CALLEI in the minimum security section of the

ACI. T-I was of the opinion that OUIMETTE might be the

individual being used by SCIARRA to set up CALLEI in a

prison killing.. T-l pointed out the well-known fact

that SCIARRA and CALLEI are at odds and that the prison

officials are cognizant of the threats made by SCIARRA

to remove CALLEI.

T-l further advised that apparently DANTE

SCIARRA made the comment that the SCIARRAS have Silver

Lake, NICK BIANCO has Federal Hill and EDDIE ROMANO has

Charles Street, with regards to the control of gambling

and illegal activity: DANTE SCIARRA, brother of RUDY,

commented that the SCIARRAS, while they have Silver Lake,

would rather have Thornton, which is the district function-

ing under the control of the CALLEI faction, with BABE

PEZZO watching over CALLEI's interest in that location.

T-1 advised that FRANK AMBROGLIA from Boston

and FREDDIE BISHOP are in the SCARRA camp and are ir

contact with DANIE SCIARRA and also LUCY SCIARRA.

T-I advised that LUCY SCIARRA has telephone

number 274-1870, and uses it in contacting individuals

from Boston for her husband.

FREDDIE BISHOP is living with

a girl by the name of JENNIFER.
