considered for any initial aotion®

chen questlonod about the identitlos of follower

of Major UNWEILAS, A/l atated

that it would be botter to

refer to AMLASE, as he (A/1) could only give infomation that

was three years old and henoe not very accurate.

We did not

presa the question, nor suggost names, as it was evident

that he felt that his answers would simply not give a true,

current ploture.

and in particular quostioned A/1 about AMASH'y frame o

mind and future plans which he may have revealed to A/1

aftor Ontrich departed the acene.

A/l made aeveral pointo,

which basically boiled down to the fact that AMASIl wag

still not pleased with the support he was getting from the

USa side.

The vialt with DAINOLD, who aoted in the capaolty

of a representative of high levels of the Govt concerned

with the Cuban problem, satialled AMASH as far as polloyy

was concerned, but he was not at all happy with the faot

that he still was not given the tochnical asstatance for

the operational plan as he saw it. A/I said that AMLASH

dwelt constantly on this point.

He could not understand

why he was denied certain small pleces of equipment which

promised a final solution to the problem, while, on the

other hand, the USO gave mich equipment and money to exile

grOupE for

their inoffective excursione against 'Cuban

coastal targets.

According to A/1, AMLASH

on this polut,

and we will lone whatever progress we have made to date.

A/l stated that AMAST now has hia feet wet vie-a-via

cooperating with USf and has accepted the Inct that he will

work profitably and securely with it.

It 1e thie that we

stand to lose with our procrastination.

AMLASH also

talked about going to the french terroriet group, the OAS,

In order to got the cateriale and guidance he needs.

Is bolleved. that he was talked out of this idea, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASH!.

T. With rogard to the radio gear, AMLASH stated

Lbat he did not feel

that he wanted to take

one in with

him, particularly in vier of the recent arrests in Cuba

of agenta carrying concealed radios.

He was not opposed,

however, at this timo to ha:ung:a radlo cached for hiw,

to be recovered by him later.

According to AMMlIP, 1f there lo ony interest

Cuba, these names would have to be given to him belore he

returned: otheruise he would not trust any other means

A/l stated that AMLAST talked about getting

aid from, or at least discussing his position, with

ManOlo RAI.

However, he stated that he questioned whether

this was the beat idea, since 1I RAY came to Paris mile

he (LASH) was there, people would conclude that there was-

10. At the time of A/l's departure, AMASH

Be possible.)

12.

AMAS! talked about the two posalbilitios

of re-taking

Cuba - elthor thru invasion by IS troops, or

his way.

Ne also realizod, however, that invaston was

not to bo considered seriously at thie tine.

ALSO, AILASHI

talked about his ability to take some men into the hilla

of Las Villas Provinoo and taking

the suall towns of

Trinidad and Topes de Collantes.

Ile said that he and bid

men oould last no more than 15 days in the hills as the

anti-guerrilla fightors now employed by the Regime were

eX-guerillas

thenselves and knew the way to fight and

wistin the kills.

Also the Soviet equipment made the govt

forces much more

formidable than in Batiata's time. AMLASH

apparently was discussing those idoas with the impression

that this was the way to not up a provisional rebel govt

toked, at 16 Yatry dortain that Arisis realized that

By the way All

this was not the kind of a plan whioh could even remotely

be expected to receive USO ald. It la hoped that he

does realize that lovana must firat be taken... or falling

that, a truoly sizablo piece re Jand (say, almost an •

entire provinco) which could be a crue rallying point and

staging ground inder complere Rebel control, from which

the rest of the laland could be wrosted from the Fideliotas

In summary, the talks with A/l led the

undermigned to bellove that AMASil is again entering

one of his skeptical moods, one which our actione have

done little to dispel.

Too little and too late......•
