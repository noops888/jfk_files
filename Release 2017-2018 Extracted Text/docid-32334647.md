Memorandum to The Director

Re: TEN MOST WANTED BUREAU FUGITIVES

In checking out this information, the Albuquerque Office further deter-

mined that this same individual believed to be Williams had reported he

was

going to Gallup, New Mexico, to seek employment in that locality

and

to stay in Gallup for the Indian "Pow Wow" which

was

to be held in that city during the past weekend. The Albuquerque

Office is affording this phase of the investigation careful attention

and

every effort is being made to determine the identity of the

individual in Gallup who might possibly be Williams.

A Norfolk confidential informant, on August 14, 1959, reported

having received a call from a friend requesting assistance in obtaining

a house in the norfolk area for the family of Caleb Diggs, subject's

brother.

Caleb Diggs has been in the Veterans Hospital at Fayetteville,

North Carolina, recuperating from injuries received

• in an automobile

At the time of the accident, Caleb Diggs

nad drought his tamiy to his parents' ome at hamiet, worth carolina,

from their former residence at Nyack, New York. Caleb Diggs resided

subject's home during the same period when the murder of subject's

family, for which subject is wanted, took place.

The Norfolk informant

FREDERICK GRAND DUNN

Reports have been received from informants who are in contact

with associates of Dunn that Dunn is hiding out on a farm or fishing

camp operated by an Indian possibly in minnesota or Wisconsin. Steps

being

taken to circularize game wardens and licensed

guides to determine the identity of Indians who may be operating farms

or fishing camps.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police contacted the Legal Attache

at Ottawa on August 14, 195?, and reported that one Anthony Farrelie,

an ian don ed polio

who has furnished reliable information to them in the past and who is

confined in the

Saskatchewan Penitentiary, reported to them that a fellow

prisoner, Don O'malley, requested that when he,

Farrelie, is released

from prison, he contact an individual in Detroit, Michigan, for the

purpose of passing a message to Dunn.

Farrelie was scheduled to be

released from the

Saskatchewan Penitentiary on July 29, 1959.

O'Malley,

who was a fellow inmate with Dunn when both were confined at the Ohic

State Penitentiary, desired that a contact in Detroit warn Dunn that

authorities believe he is in Canada:

O'Malley admitted to the Royal

Canadian Mounted Police source that he knows where Dunn is, but never

would divulge the information. Efforts are being made to arrange for a

meeting between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police source and the Detroit

contact for Dunn.
