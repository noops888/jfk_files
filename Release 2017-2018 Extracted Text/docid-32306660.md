2/21/67 and early morning of 2/22/67, drinking with other

Dallas associates and missed 10 AM contact with WAGGONER and

BROWN on 2/22/67. Subject, according to informant, made

number of calls to Hot Springs, in efiort to reach

BROWN

WAGGONER at Hot Springs but was not successful. Subject has

now apparently given up going to Hot Springs.
