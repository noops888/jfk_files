D. ICN INFLUENCE IN CANADA

It has been previously reported that in January of

1965, STEVE MAGADDINO mentioned that he had "been in

Canada for 45 years" and specifically named Montreal as a

location, where he had considerable influence.

Investigation has developed that the COTRONI

Brothers have controlled or played a major role in

directing all major criminal activities in the Montreal

area. Previous reports have identified the members of the

COTRONI organization.

In March of 1966, PETER A. MAGADDINO and DOMINIC

ROMEO were

reportedly in touch with VINCENT COTRONI and

PAUL VIOLT in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

И)

On November 28, 1966, the Montreal Police

Department, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, arrested WILLIAM

BONANNO, also known as SALVATORE VINCENT BONANNO, the son of

JOE BONANNO, PATRICK and VITO DE FILIPPO, LOUIS GRECO,

PETER NOTARO, CARL SIMARI and PETER JOSEPH MAGADDINO,

cousin of STEVE MAGADDINO who had been missing from his

The informant

was of the opinion that this indicated some

meeting in the United States in the near future, which meeting

would probably be attended by COTRONI, who had left Monüreal

for an unlinon destination. &

PAUL VIOLI was suggested as a possible intermidiary.

to the United

were apparently not forthcoming. &
