(JAK)

WILLIAM JAMES LOVERY, JR., On 11/19/64, advised SAs

KUYKENDALL and MYRC T. SCHOLBERG in addition to data contained

in Dallas airtel to Bureau, 11/19/64, that two or three days

previously he was contacted by Detective STRINGFELLOW and

another officer, both of the Special Service Bureau, Dallas

Police Department.

They had in their possession a list of names dealing

with former menbers of the American GI Forun, Dallas.

They

were interested in developing information from him concerning

persons who had been in the GI Forum.

LOWERY stated he wanted to be cooperative with them,

and as they called certais names, be told them as best he

could that they had been in the GI Forum but had no affiliations

with any subversive organizations which included J. MOLINA.

He made it clear to them that MOLINA was not a member of the

Communist Party (CP) and so far as he knew had no knowledge

that the CI Forum had in the past been dominated or infil-

trated by the CP.

They inquired also about several other individuals,

rELI& BOLALO. LockY stated as the officers came to the

names of those four individuals who had in the past been

affiliated with the CP, he declined to discuss his knowledge

concerning those persons.

LOWERY realized after he had con-

pleted his discussion with then that the Dallas Police Department

officers may assume fron his failure to discuss those four persons

that they may have had some subversive background.
