the British and the French on one

side and (the U.S.) on

establish the (International Control) Commission and also:

on the fact that the French and

the British up to now have

taken

the view

that a neutralist government is the only

thing

to do whereas

the Americans have taken the view that

a pro-Western neutral (Government) is the base (upon which

to build).

the one to give a line on this sout he thinks the truth is

half-way between--that is, there is agreement on principle,.

and perhaps there is not yet agreement on how to do it..:

MORGAN asks' what the french answerf has been to the American

argument that to have a coalition government would be too

dangerous,

that it would bleed the regime to weakness--

MORGAN explains that he is referring to a seemingly

illuminating dispatch which the Washington Post reprinted

from the London Observer last Thursday in which it was said

that many British feel that the Americans threw away a

golden opportunity of restoring peace and political equilib-

rium to Laos when they failed to support SOUVANNA PHOUMA.

LEBEL emphasizes that every

ground (and not quotation)

MORGAN accepts it as such...e

also, MORGAN continues, a report in the Washington

Post by this rather good reporter, WARREN UNNA, in which he

said that there had been a hassle between (the

U.S.)

Ambassador and CIA field people on the one hand and

Washington

CIA and the State Department on the other, that the field

people were

but that they were

overruled. Useless to say, LabeL replies if he were
