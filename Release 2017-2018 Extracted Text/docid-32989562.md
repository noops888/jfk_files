RE: INTERVIEW OF FORFER SAC ROY K. MOORE OF THE FBI BY SSC

involving him in a violation of the law. He was intervlewed

by Supervisor Bill Anderson of the Philadelphia nffice whe

happened to be in the Resident Agency at that time.

'Ultimately, Mr. Anderson convinced Vir. Hardy

that he should assist his Goveriment and report on the

activities of those individuals who were planning the break-in

of the Federal Building.

"over a period of time, Hardy assisted those whn

had already been working on the survelllance of the building

and planning the break-in and was able to furnish Agents the

names of those involved, their plans, and was successful in

helping effect their arrest when the break-in occurred.

"The interviews with li. Hardy were recorded on

tape. They were played back to the Agents on the Speclal,

and In many instances it 1s a matter of record that fit. liardy

was cautloned by the Agents handling him not to become a

'provncateur.' Upon the arrest of the 28 individuals uho

binke into the federal Building, Mr. Hardy was a willing

Government witness.

However, subsequent thereto one of

his children fell from a tree and was impaled on an iron post

and later died as a result. It is our understanding that his

religious advisors convinced him that this was retzibution

for turning against his fellow conspliators and assisting.

the Goverrment. He ultimately testified for the defendants

rather than the Government.

"In my affidavit, I explained that the Camden 28

case was one of 58 break-ins Involving Selective Service

Boards and Federal Buildings and that, as a result of latent

prints developed in the various break-ins and the printing (finger)

of the defendants in the Camden 28 case, we were able to

make comparisons and solve 16 of the unsolved break-ins,

thus showing that the Canden 28 case was part of a larger

conspiracy than that one incident.

"Additionally, the question was asked why we

didn't make the arrest upon the breaking of the window of

the Federal Building In Ganden or even before on the basis

of conspiracy rather than letting them consummate the crime

of breaking, entering and carrying away the files. It pas

explained that this matter was closely followed with

Departmental attorneys and the Assistant U. S, Attorney,

New Jersey, to insure that they were satisfied that the

elements of the Crime on Goverment Reservation Statutes

had been satisfied. The lepartmental attorneys were

Mr. Goodwin and lit. dubbage. It ses further explained that

the Berrigan case had just occurred and that their defense

was that, while they had talked about kidnapping fir. Kissinger,

they never really intended to do it and obviously the

Departmental attorneys and Assistant U. S. Attorney wanted

to insure that there was no question as to the intention of

these individuals. However, the best information could be

obtained from these attorneys as to the reasons for their

decisions.

"The latter part of the deposition dealt with my

personal opinion of the use of informants in intelligence

investigations. Obviously, I endeavored to justify the

use of informants as being far superior to investigative

operations for the true intent of the persons comprising

any group who have as a purpose destruction of the establishment

or overthrow of the Goverument."

NOTE:

Mr. Moore telephonically dictated the results of

the interview to a Bureau stenographer on 11/18/75.

RE:

REQUEST PERTAINING TO AUTHORILATION

AND PURPOSE OF BLBCTROHIC SURVEILLANCES

CONDUCTED BY THE FBI

With respoct to Item 6, our records indicate a

aicrophone surveillance was authorized on two roons at

the Sheraton Park Hotel, New York City, where

Martin I. King, Jx., and Bemard Lee,

an associate,

were to reside during the period larch 29 to March

31, 1965.

Neither king nor lee occupied those rooms during this

period, having registered at a different location in

Bew York. City.

Although the surveillanee was authorised on

a room which lee was to occupy, it was not directed at

Ine personally, but instituted to provide full coverage

of King's activities while at the Sheraton Park Hotel.:

In that rogard, ve have included naterial showing

surveillance coverago of king on an earlier date

January 1965.

ie belleve this surveillance activity

shows the intent of the surveillance authorized in

March, 1965, nanely, to provide full coverage to areas

likely to be used by king and his associates for meetings.

New York called today and advised that King,l

Office had for monitoring purposes the availability of Rooms 2439

scheduled to vie in the not til he nee to eatel.)

It was felt the results of the discussion would contain considerable

intelligence information.

New York said that through other informa-

tion which they hare developed, it appears the meeting will actually

be held in Hauntel'sjoffice, but New York still strongly recommended

use of microphone coverage in the rooms occupied by King's party

as the results of the meeting in /Machtel's Joffice would later be

(discussed in the hotel rooms.

In view of King's continued contact with Claraive Jones

who is King's conduit for contact with communist Stanley Levison?

and: in view of other activities of King, it is considered highly

desirable that New York place microphone coverage on these rooms

security would be availablejand that the individuals involved will be

under physical surveillance so the microphone installation could be

made during the conference in Wachtel's office. New York contemplated

use of two Wasp instruments, which would not involve running wires out

of the rooms and which instruments can be installed with

full security.

ACTION:

Under the circumstances, I authorized New York to go ahead

with the installation provided it

could be done with full security.

ADDENDUM

LEGAL COUNSEL DIVISION PVD:lad

72/30/75

While on a informal basis the Senate Select Committee

has been notifying the bureau prior to release of Bureau documents

outside the Connittee, there is no written agreement that they

will do so. In this instance, Legal Counsel Division understands

that the Bureau in responding

to a motion for discovery in the

Fonda law suit stated that Jane Fonda was not the target of a

COINTELPRO activity.

This statement was based on a review of the

main file pertaining to Fonda and Bureau indices. The Senate

Select Committee subsequently determined, in fact, she was the

target of COINTELPRO and furnished copies of those documents to

Fonda's attorney.

We recommend that no protest be made to the

Committee. Departmental Attorney Seibert is aware that we

failed

to locate

and furnish two documents germaine to the motion for

discovery and corrective action concerning this matter is being

taken.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TESTIMONY

DECEMBER 11, 1975

Training

elephone Rm. -

iroctor Sec'y -

Attached is a draft of the Attorney General's testimony to be

given before the Church Committee on December 11, 1975. The draft

was forwarded to me by Jack Fuller of the Attorney General's office today

with a request for comments. I furnished a copy of the draft to Mr. Adams

and to Mr. Wannall and I reviewed a copy. After consulting with Mr. Adams

and Mr. Wannall, I called Jack Fuller and advised him that we would

recommend the following changes:

On page 8, first full paragraph following line 7, we recommend

the addition of "The Director promptly responded to my request."

On page 12, first full paragraph, we recommend the addition

of the following sentence after the first sentence of the paragraph:

"However, today the FBI continues its long-established practice of

submitting investigative results in such matters to the Criminal

Division. "

On page 12, first full paragraph, the last sentence states the

standard to be followed in domestic security investigations. I recommended

to Fuller that the standard seeking to require a "conclusion that the

individual is engaged in certain activities" be modified to require only

that there be a "reasonable suspicion that the individual is engaged in

such activities. " Fuller told me that the Attorney General had changed

the language from "conclusion" so that the sentence would read: "The

standard would be that there must be specific and articulable facts giving

reason to believe that the individual or group under investigation is

engaged in the activities I have just listed. " I pointed out to Fuller that

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee

the standard expressed in that sentence is equivalent to the probable

cause requirement for an arrest and that if we had that information the

FBI would be authorized to proceed to make an immediate arrest instead

of merely to conduct an investigation. Mr. Fuller said he understood

that problem, but that the Attorney General had directed the standard

to be "'reason, se to believe."

I then asked Mr. Fuller if he would be willing to modify the

sentence so that the standard would include information that the

individual is engaged "or may be engaged" in the activities. He said that

possibility had been discussed specifically with the Attorney General

and the Attorney General declined to modify the standard in that way.

Therefore, the Attorney General will state tomorrow that the standard

will be "reason to believe."

TION

RATA

The Committee has

asked me to talk with you

today about the future of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

I thought it might be helpful if I outline quite briefly

some of the points I would like to make, some of the

problems I think ought to be considered, and some of the

steps we have taken.

The first point is that the statutory base

for the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully

satisfactory. The basic statutory provision is 28 USCA

533 which provides that the Attorney General may appoint

officials "(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against the

United States; (2) to assist in the protection of the

President; and (3) to conduct such investigations regarding

official

matters under the control of the Department. of

Justice and the Department of State as may be directed by

the Attorney General.". There are other statutes, such

as the Congressional Assassination, Kidnapping and Assault

Act, which vest in the Bureau special responsibilities to

investigate criminal violations. In addition, there are

Executive orders and Presidential statements or directives

which place investigatory responsibilities upon the Bureau.

A number of questions are often asked about this

statutory base. It has the virtue of simplicity, but the

Executive orders which deal with government employee

investigations are complicated and confusing, and Presidential

NH 55114 DocId: 32989562 Page 47

ENGrOSs 02-116 395-1253

## Page 48

- 2 -

memoranda, or, perhaps, oral instructions from a President,

may be difficult to collate. I think it is important,

in any case, to separate out the kinds of questions which

are asked

about the Bureau's authority base. Some questions

are constitutional in nature, relating to the inherent power

of the president; others go to the interpretation of the

statutes and the relationship between the statutes and

Presidential directives; others go to the failure of the

statutes to define sufficiently the areas of the Bureau's

jurisdiction or to spell out sufficiently--and this is

partly constitutional--the means and methods which the Bureau

is permitted to use in carrying out its assigned tasks.

The second point, related to the first, is a

continuing discussion of the role of the Bureau in intelligence

investigations or domestic security investigations. The

argument is sometimes made that the Bureau's proper role,

at least in purely domestic matters, should be limited to

investigations of committed crimes. The basic statute for

the Bureau is broader than this, as have been Executive

orders and Presidential mandates. to the Bureau. The basic

statute is broader, since it refers to investigations

regarding official matters under the control of the Department

of Justice and the Department of State as may be directed

by the Attorney General. A disparity is sometimes seen

among

the different roles of the Bureau in crime detection,

in on-going domestic security matters, and in foreign

intelligence or foreign counterintelligence matters. In

55114

DooId: 32989562

## Page 49

- 3 -

recent days a statement by the then Attorney General Harlan

Fiske Stone, who

established the Bureau and chose J. Edgai

Hoover as its director, has been quoted as

a relevant

warning.

Stone warned "There is always the possibility

that a secret police may become a menace to free government

and free institutions, because it carries with it the

possibility of abuses of power which are not always quickly

apprehended or understood .... It is important that its

activities be strictly limited to the performance of those

functions for which it was created and that its agents

themselves be not above the law or beyond its reach ....

The Bureau of Investigation is not concerned with

political

or other opinions of individuals. It is concerned only

with their conduct and then only with such conduct as is

forbidden by the laws of the United States. When a police

system passes beyond these limits, it is dangerous to the

proper administration of justice and to human liberty, which

it should be our first concern to cherish."

I should like to suggest that Stone's warning always

must be considered relevant to the proper conduct of the

Bureau's duties, but it does not necessarily follow that

domestic security investigations are, therefore, outside

the Bureau's proper functions. The detection of crime in

some

areas requires preparation and

at least some knowledge

of

what is likely to be going on. What is at issue, I think,

HH 55114

DocId: 32989562 Page 49

---

## Page 50

- 4 -

is the proper scope, the

means and methods used, the attention

paid to conduct and not views, and the closeness of the

relationship of the conduct and that which is forbidden by

the laws of the United States:

Third, I realize that some proposals, since I

was asked about this when I last appeared before this

Committee, might separate out in some fashion domestic and

foreign intelligence functions from the FEI or from one

another within the FBI. This is, of course, an issue to

be looked at. I assume it is recognized that there may

be some relationship between that intelligence which is

domestic and that intelligence which is involved in foreign ￾

counterintelligence work. One may lead to the other..

And there may be a relationship between foreign counter-

intelligence and foreign intelligence. If the work were

separated out into different agencies, I do not know if

the decision about when an investigation should pass

from one agency to another always could be made easily.

Moreover, even so, information presumably would pass from:

one

agency to the other. I know that one consideration

has been that it might be decided that information collected

by some permitted means in intelligence investigations

under some circumstances should not be used in criminal

prosecutions.

But if there is an exchange of information,

this must

always be a consideration, whether there are

separate agencies or not, and the basic question then is one

NW 55114

of use and not organization. The more active concern,

I believe, is that there is a risk that conduct proper for

one area may be improper for another, and that the combination

can work a contamination. My view on this is that in any

case we must decide what conduct is appropriate and is

inappropriate for each of the areas, and we must take

steps to make sure that conduct is lived up to. My hope

is that the fact that the FBI has criminal investigative

responsibilities,which must be conducted within the confines

of constitutional protections strictly enforced by the courts,

gives the organization an awareness of the interests of

individual liberties that might be missing in an agency

devoted solely to intelligence work. I know the argument

can be run the other way. I believe the dangers are greater

if there is separation.

NW 55114 DocId: 32989562 Page 51

Fourth, there is a question as to the proper role of

the FBI in crime prevention and whether or not it should be

considered authorized to take steps under some circumstances

to reduce the likelihood that crimes will be committed

or that serious injury to persons

or property will occur.

• Preventive action has raised serious questions and these

must be dealt with. But I suppose an initial question is

whether it should be allowed at all. Yet I believe under

special circumstances and with proper controls most would

believé this to be a proper function.

Fifth, the problem of proper controls, supervision and

accountability is all-embracing. By statute the Federal

Bureau of Investigation is in the Department of Justice,

and also by statute the Attorney General is the head of the

Department of Justice. The history is mixed, of course, and

we all have a tendency to over simplify, but it is à fair

statement that there have been times in the past when the

supervision by Attorneys General, granted that the Bureau must

have considerable autonomy, has been sporadic, practically

nonexistent, or ineffective. I hope that is not the case now.

The responsibility is a heavy one. But in any event the prob.

lem of proper controls, supervision and accountability goes

beyond the Director of the Bureau and the Attorney General.

I have already mentioned that in my view the statutory base for

• the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully satis-

factory. I think that better controls and performance can

be achieved through statutory neans, executive orders, guide-

linas, and reporting to appropriate congressional committees.

: • Sixth, before

come to a resume of some

the steps •

which have been

taken, let me say I know we all realize that

in the past there have been grave abuses. I am uncomfortable

with a kind of writing of history, however, which sees it only

in terms of the abuses and not in terms of past and present

strength. It is very difficult to be fair to the past in which

many institutions of government carried a share of responsibility.

But more than unfairness is involved, If we are not careful,.

we will turn to solutions of the moment which a better reading

of history might indicate are not the best solutions.. I know

we must seize the moment if I may use such a phrase in this

setting. I know also that this Committee realizes that a very

important agency with dedicated, highly professional, greatly

• disciplined government servants is involved. The importance

is to the security and domestic tranquility of the United States.

Stone's warning was given in an act of creation. He was proud

• of his creation. In spite of the abuses, there is a proper

place for pride. I take it our mutual work should be to nurture

that pride and the conditions which justify it.

I turn now to a review of some of the steps which have been

taken or are in progress. We have tried most diligently, under

safeguards to protect the privacy of individuals and with an

awareness

of the unfairness of instant history to give.a

• great deal of information to Congressional committees. Attorney

General Saxbe, Deputy Attorney General Silberman, and Director •

Kolley testified about the so-called COINTELPRO. When the FBI

discovered evidence of several more COINTELPRO projects after I•

became Attorney General, these weie revealed.

One of my first

acts as Attorney General, my third week in office, was to testify

before a Congressional committee about possible incidents of

political misuse of the FBI by the White House in the past

and about the nature of FBI file-keeping systems, particularly

•the files kept by Director Hoover in his office suite. Director

Kelley has spoken publicly and before congressional committees

•about incidents in the past in which FBI agents engages in

break-ins to gather or photograph pyhsical evidence in intelli-

gence investigations. On a number of occasions, most recently in

testimony before this Committee, I have described the history

of the use of electronic surveillance by the FBI. We have

welcomed such opportunities.

On February 26, 1975, I directed Director Kelley to

report to me any requests made of the Bureau or practices within

the Bureau which he deems improper or which present the appear-

ance of impropriety. On February 28, 1975, Director Kelley

ordered FBI personnel to report such requests or practices to

him. In July 1975 I reaffirmed my February directive and also

asked for a report of all

Directory

has regularly provided information on conduct

by Bureau agents and programs underway within the Bureau that

could raise questions. These matters have been reviewed and •

discussed within the Department so that a consistent and approp-

riate policy can be achieved.. This is a continuing process.

I do not assert that we are aware of everything about the Bureau.

Nor do I suggest that we ought to know everything. Appropriate

this level

have to be selective. I make this point, which I think may

sound disconcerting, not in any way to minimize the respon-

sibility of the Bureau to keep the Department informed. nor

minimize the Department's duty to find out. Rather

I want to be realistic about a learning and organization

problem which requires realism if it is to be understood

and perfected.

With respect to possible legislation, the Department

has in preparation various drafts of possible bills which may

•be of assistance in the area of what is now warrentless

electronic surveillance. Although ebtaining a judicial warrant

does not automatically eradicate the possibility of abuse;

it is

perceived to be an important safeguard of individual

privacy interests, and we are exploring, as we said we would

do, various possibilities and alternatives.

Finally, a committee within the Department of Justice--

chaired by Mary Lawton; Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the

Office of Legal Counsel and composed of representatives of my

office (Jack Fuller), the Criminal and Civil Rights Division

(Phil White, Walter Barnett), the Office of Policy and Planning

(Alan Kornblum) and the FBI (John Hotis) --has been working for

eight months reviewing FBI procedures in many areas and drafting

guidelines to govern those procedures in the future. The Committee

has produced draft guidelines covering White House inquiries,

Congressional and Judicial staff appointment investigations, un-

solicited mail, and domestic security investigations. It is

currently at work on guidelines covering counterespionage. in-

vestigations and will later: consider the use of informants, the

employee loyalty program, organized crime intelligence investiga-

tions, criminal investigations, and other aspects of FBI practice.

The Committee's work has been extensive and time-consuming. "It

has involved not only questions of proper safeguards but also of

efficiency in the proper functioning of the Bureau. It has

been an effort to translate into words the complicated and

important mechanisms for controlling the FBI. I hope the

Comnittee's efforts at articulation will be of use to this Con-

mittee and others as it considers drafting legislation.

You have received copies of the

latest drafts of the

guidelines that have been substantially completed by the Committee.

These guidelines do not yet represent Department policy. There.

is disagreement within the Department on some aspects of these

guidelines. I have disagread with the Committee recommendations

HW 55114

from

time to time, and the FBI has raised substantial questions

rabout-other-recommendations-particularly with respect to the

treatment of unsolicited mail. Some of the proposals in the

guidelines could be promulgated as departmental regulation.

Congress may feel some ought to be enacted into statutory law.

Other provisions would require implementation by executive order.

I would be glad to discuss these draft guidelines with

you in detail in response to your questions, but a brief discussion

of the guidelines on domestic security may be useful at the outset.

The guidelines begin by attempting to impose some order

and definiteness

to the domestic security field. To begin

with, these guidelines do not deal with FBI efforts to counter-

act the work of foreign intelligence services operating within

the United States. Standards for determining when there is

foreign involvement sufficient to place a subject in the category.

of foreign counterintelligence investigation are now being debated

within the guidelines committee.

The domestic security guidelines

also are not meant to cover security or background investigations

of federal appointees or investigations of ordinary crimes. Under

the draft guidelines domestic security investigations are only •

to be authorized when there is a likelihood that the activities

of individuals or groups involve or will involve the use of force

or violence in violation of federal law. Domestic security inves-

tigations are to be limited to activities of individuals or groups

intended to accomplish one of five purposes: overthrowing the

government of the United States or of a State; interfering with

tt..:

activitias within the United States of foreign governments

or their representatives; influencing government policies by

interfering by force or violence with government functions or

interstate commerce; depriving individuals of their civil rights;

• and creating domestic violence or rioting when such violence

or rioting would necessitate as a countermeasure the use of

federal armed forces. There is also a provision for limited

investigation when there is a clear and immediate threat of domestic

mp455998 peered

violence which is likely to result in a request by a state for.fed-

eral armed assistance.

Currently there is no procedure requiring the review out-

such indiers

side the FBI of allion trifintelligence investigations con-

ducted by the FBI. Under the draft guidelines there would be

a comprehensive program of reporting to the Attorney General of

his designee of

all preliminary and full domestic intelligence

investigations. The Attorney General would be required under

the draft guidelines to put a stop to any full investigation whose

justification did not meet an established standard. The standard

would be that there must be specific and articulable facts justing

personable

mispron reason to beline.

tifying the conclusion that the individual or group under inves-

tigation is

.. or may be

engaged in the activities I have just listed.

Anther feature of the draft guidelines is to place

strict controls upon the use of any technique by the FBI which

goes beyond the gathering of information. COINTELPRO was the

name given the use of some such techniques. As I have said

• before, some of the activities in COINTELPRO were outrageous

and the others were foolish. Nonetheless, there may be circum-

HH 55114 DocId:32989562 Page 58

## Page 59

- 13 -

stances involving an immediate risk to human life or to extraordin-

arily important government functions that could only be

countered by some sort of preventive action. The guidelines

require that any such preventive action proposal be submitted

to the Attorney General. He could authorize the preventive

action only when there is probable cause to believe that the

violence is imminent and when such measures are necessary to

minimize the danger to life or property. The preventive action

would in all cases have to be nonviolent. The Attorney General

would be rquired to report to Congress periodically and no less

often than once a year on the use of preventive action by the

FBI.

I make no claim that during this rather difficult but

interesting and--I must trust--promising period, that we have

achieved all that might have been possible. In many ways the

work has been disappointingly slow. But I do think we have

made advances in nurturing and helping to improve a structure

which will be supportive of the best efforts of the men and

women in the Department of Justice and in the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. No procedures are fail-safe against abuse.

The best protection remains the quality and professionalism of

the member of the Bureau and of the Department.

the Honorable Walter W. Jenkins

Special Assistant to the

responsive to the SSC's request, noting that the July 15,

Furnishing of information obtained through electronic surveil-

It would appear the notation

in seference to a July 16, 1964, nemorandum appearing on the

July 15, 1964, memorandum is erroneous. A copy of the mem-

orandum enclosed with the letter to Mr. Jenkins ia not boing

is the product of electronic surveillance of King.

With respect to Item 9, a scarch of logical Bureau

records failed to locate any newspaper clippings or magazine

articles

pertinent to the memorandum mentioned above.

Item 6c as set forth in referenced SSC letter is

not being responded to in this memorandum. This request,

per conversation between Special Agent Seynor F. Phillips

and Michael Shaheen, JI., Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination of the Department of Justice on December 3, 1975,

has been restated in a separate SSC letcer dated December 4g

1975, and will be responded to separately.

With regard to excisions in materials being delivered

herewith, where no notation appears as to reason for excision,

the excision was made for the reason that the inforation

actually summarizes or quotes from conversations monitored

during electronic surveillances of King.

In some cases, it

can be ascertained precisely what information in FBI files

came from electronic surveillances of DI. King; however,

there exist areas where documentation of the information is

not precise and no accurate determination can be made.

There-

fore, no assurances can be given that portions of the material

being furnished do not contain information developed as a

result of electionic surveillances of King.

NOTE:

taining to 30 telephone and 9 microphone surveillances with

respect to authorizations and purpose of the coverage.

extent of research and preparation necessary to comply

this request rule out our meeting this deadline.

Mr. Steven

Blackhurst of the Department was consulted on this problem

on November 20. On Decemoer L, Mr. John ELlitI, DIrector,

Domestic Intelligence Task Force,

SSC, advised

Elmer W. Larson, Jr., that, for the present, the requests

made on the November 21 letter would be confined to Items 1

Re: FRANK CAPELL

ESPIONAGE - X

The subject is the editor of the newsletter,

"The Herald

of Freedom." He is an extremist in his attitude toward communisn

and uses his newsletter to expose people and organizations he

considers communist and subversive.

Capell is known to be in possession of information

classified up to and including "Secret," some of which originated

with this Bureau and some with thel

ORK Act 6 11110)

He has refused to furnish his source for this information.

Capell

has published some of this classified information in copies of

his newsletter and he has advised this Bureau that he plans to

publish a book which will contain additional classified information.

It appears that the subject's source is a United States Government

employee having access to the classified information and his action

in furnishing Capell this classified information, plus Capell's.

publishing it, constitutesa danger to the internal security of

the :

United States. In at least one instance there is a danger of a

most sensitive source of this Bureau being compromised.

If the

identity of Capell's source can be learned, we may eliminate

this security threat.

In view of the above, it is requested that you authorize

technical coverage on the subject's residence located at

MELIORANDUN FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

RE: JACK LEVINE

Jack Levine resides at 203 West 90th Street,

New York 24, New York. He is a former Special Agent oi

the FBI, serving from September 12, 1960, to Augusi 4,

1961.

Since he left the FBI, he has engaged in a

vindictive and irrational attack upon this agency and

its operations.

In the October 20, 1962, issue of "The Nation"

magazine, Levine wroüe an

article entitled 'Hoover and

the

Red Scare," in which he has disclosed highly classified

information relaving to the operations of this Bureau.

there

•is every indication

that he intends to continue disclosing

sensitive incormation.

For example, Levine appeared on

New Yorks Radio Station WBAI on the evening of October 13,

1962, at which time he

disclosed information of a confi

dential nature concerning investigations conducted by this

Burcau.

The Communist Party is already aware of Levine's

actions and it is velieved that nembers of this Party will

be in contact with him, if they have not alzeady done so. ::

Further, it is likely

that representatives of

cornunist

nations will be in contact with him seeking information.

Levine has knowledge of some of this agency's most valuable

informants. If he disclosed them, he could do this country's

national defense irreparable hari.

In order to adequately protect the security of

this country, it is requested that authority be granted to

place a technical surveillance at his current residence or

at any future address to wich he may move.

RE: JACK LEVINE

Jack Levine resides at 203 West 90th Street,

New York 24, New Yori.

lle is a former Special Agent of

the FBI, serving from Septenber 12, 1960, to Augusi 4,

1961.

Since he left the FBI, he has engaged in a

vindictive and irrational attack upon this agency and

its operations:

In the October 20, 1962, issue Of "The Nation"

magazine, Levine wrote an article entitled "Hoover and the

Red Scare," in which he has disclosed highly classified

information relating to the operations of this Bureau.

There

•is every indication that he intends to continue disclosing

sensitive information.

for example, Levine appeared on

New Yorl Radio Station WBAI on the evening of October 18,

1962, at which time he disclosed information of a conti-'

dential nature concerning investigations conductea by this

Bureau. The Communist Party is already aware of Levine's

actions and it is believed that members

of this Party vill

be in contact with him, if they have not already done so.

Further, it is likely that representatives of the Soviet

bloc nations will be in contact with him seeking information.

Levine has knowledge of some of this agency's most valuable

informants.

If he disclosed them, he could do this country's

national defense irreparable harm.

In order to adequatoly protect the security of

this country, it is requested that authority be granted to

place a technical surveillance at his current residence or

at any future address to which he may move.

Enclosed is the original of a memorandum, with

FBI Section Chief Fred J. Baungardner by sse scatt MemberS.

Also enclosed is a copy of the memorandum; with attachment, for

forwarding to Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to

the President.

As you know, we have been forwarding to you numerous

memoranda reporting the results of sse Staft interviews of

present and former FBI personnel. From time to time, we have

noted in these reports to us what might be considered

improprieties on the part of the interviewers.

We have

subnitted these reports to you without comment, Choosing to

-i-

let the facts speak for themselves insofar as the reports are

made to us by the personnel interviewed.

We are taking the

occasion of the report of the interview of Baumgardner to

call to your attention by this cormnication certain aspects

of the Baumgarcher interview suggestive of impropriety on the

part of the interviewers.

On page two of the Baumgardner memorandum, he pointed

out that he had been asked at the outset of the interview to

read and sign a form entitled "Advice of Rights." After reading +

it, Baumgardner declined to sign it and explained his reason

as

being that the form would indicate agreement by Baumgardnar

that he had appeared voluntarily for interview whereas he did

not consider that his appearance was voluntary.

of significance

is the statement made by one of the interviewers, SSC Staff

Member Michael Epstein, that unless the form was signed by

Assoc. Dir.

Baumgardner, no interview would be conducted.

Baumgardner

The Attorney General

us wherein an intervievee was told after appearing for interview

that if he did not sign the "Advice of Rights" statement the

interview would not proceed. Former FBI Special Agent George A.

Berley related a similar instance to us as reported in an FBI

memorandum dated October 23, 1975, which has been furnished .

to you.

Pages five and six of the Baumgardiner memorandum

reported the questioning of him about Martin Luther King, JI.

and the March on Washington.

Baungardner told the interviewers

that there had been a great deal of Communist Party activity

throughout the country in urging people to participate in the

March and that Communist Party leaders and members came to

Washington, D. G. and participated in the March.

At this point

in the interview, SSC Staff Member liark Citenstein asked

Baumgardner why the FBI felt that 200 communists could come

to Washington,

D. G. and take over the Government,

Baungardner

replied that no one in the FBI thought that the Communist Party-

would take over the U. S. Government during the March on

Washington.

Baungarcner further told the interviewers that he,

Baumgardner, thought that Gitenstein know that no one in the

FBI had any such idea and Baungardner wanted to know why

Gitenstein had asked him such a question.

At that point,

Gitenstein recognized that Daungardner was quite annoyed

at the

question and Citenstein Lumbled some half apologetic answer.

On page

reported the questioning of him concerning one Stanley David

Levison. According to Baungaroner, Epslein desired to get into

a detailed discussion concerning Levison and his connection

with the Conmnist Party.

Baungaroner replied that he declinec

to be crawn into any such discussion on the basis that it might

compromise TBI sources. Again, according to Baungardner, Epstein

persisted in discussing the Levison matter.

As you are aware,

there has been a longstanding agreement between

the SSG and this

Bureau in respect to interviews of this nature that interviewees

would not be required to answer questions when in their mind the

answers might be revealing of the identities of FBI confidential

SOUTCOS.

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

The following concerns an interview by SSC Staff

Members of former FBI Section Chief Fred J. Baumgardner,

On Apzil 23,

1975, the Louisville Field Office of the

FBI advised that it had been informed by Baungardner that he

had been contacted by SSC Staff lember Michael Epstein who had

sought to arrange an interview of Baumgarêner.

Baungardner

requested of the FBI that a Bureau representative be present

during interview.

On April 24, 1975, Baumgardner telephonically contacted

the Legal Counsel Division of this Bureau and related he had

been requested to come to washington, D. C., to be interviewed by

Epstein.

Baungarcher told spstein thai he wou d make hinselt

available for interview at his own office in louisville, kentuely.

Baungardner expressed concern regarding the interview, pointing

out that he had been a Section Chief in the Intelligence

Division for some 18 years and had continually dealt with very

sensitive matters which he felt were not the proper subject

matter of discussion with people outside the FBI.

Additionally,

Baungaroner pointed out that he had been out of the bureau for

some eight years and since he was not aware of current Bureau

operations,

he requested the Bureau have a representative present

during the

interview and that that individual be thoroughly

were resumed leading up to the interview which took place on

October 8, 1975.

employment agreement as to contidentlality.for the purpose of

the interview which was to concer the FBI's investigations

of Martin Luther King,

JI., Communist Influence in Racial

Movement, and his Inowledge of the Security Index and related

indices.

Attached is a memorandum prepared by Baumgardner

which reports the interview.

BACKGROUND

I was first contacted by Mike Epstein, SSC Staff

Member, in April, 1975.

Tentative arrangements were made for

Epstein to come to Louisville,

Kentucky, to conduct the

interview. I contacted the Bureau and was advised that a

current Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

(FBI) would be made available to sit in on the interview if

I requested it.

a request was made and the Bureau so

advised Epstein. Subsequently, Epstein called me and asked

whether I had

requested someone from the Bureau to sit in

on the interview.

I replied that I had, and Epstein

hung up

the phone. No further contact was made

with me until late

in September, 1975. At that time, Martha Talley, SSC Staff

Member, called me requesting that

I testify in Washington,

D. C.

After I discussed this matter with the Bureau, I made

arrangements with Martha Talley to appear before Staff Members

of the Committee in

Washington, D. C., on October.&, 1975.

The next day, alter these arrangements were completed,

Martha Talley called and advised me that I would be testifying

under oath and that I could request to be represented by an

attorney. No such request was made.

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

At approximately 10:00 a.m., October 8, 1975, I

was interviewed by the fnllowing named SSC Staif

Members:

Mike Epstein, Mark Gitenstein, Mary De Oreo, Martha Talley,

and one other Staff Member whose name I cannot recall. Epstein

began the interview by handing me a typed sheet captioned

"Advice of Rights".

He asked me to read and sign that sheet.

a type sheet captione stein

After reading it, I declined to sign it. Epstein stated he

didn't understand my reluctance to sign the "Advice of Rights"

form inasmuch as the FBI always did this when they conducted

the rel dance.

interviews.

Epstein was corrected on this statement and war

told that

the FBI did not require every interviewee to sign

an "Advice of Rights" statement unless the interview involved

a possible violation of the law on the part of the person

being interviewed.

Thousands of interviews are conducted

the FBI where it would be completely out of place to advise

people that statements they might make could be used against

them in a court of law. Epstein then indicated that unless

• "Advice of Rights"

form was signed, no interview would be

conducted. I replied that I had come to Washington at the

insistence of the Committee,

I was present,

was available and

willing to go through

with the interview but I would not sign

the "Advice of Rights" form. One point in the form stated

that the interviewee had appeared voluntarily for interview.

I made the point the I had not come voluntarily but had come

only at the insistence of the Committee.

At the beginning of the interview, Epstein handed

me two or three memoranda.

During the course of the interview,

he let me read several other memoranca.

In all, he made

available to me a total of 12 memorandums, the captions and

dates of which are set out as follows:

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J, BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q. Why did the FBI open a case on Martin Luther King and

the SCLC?

A. To the best of my recollection, some Communists were in

the headquarters of the SCLC.

In addition, a secret

Communist Party member was exerting influence on King.

Since King made policy decisions for the SCLC, the FBI

had the responsibility to determine whether this important

organization was being used by the Communist Party for

its own

purposes.

Q.

A.

When and why did the Bureau change from a Communist

infiltration investigation to an effort to expose King?

We had developed information concerning King's moral conduct

which indicated a vulnerability on his part and since the

Communists were exerting influence on him, it appeared to

be in the best interest of the country from a security

Q. Did you know a tape of activity concerning King and others,

which took place at the Washington Hotel, was sent to

Mrs. King?

A.

I don't recall any such incident and the first I can recall

about it was a news item which appeared a few weeks ago

in a Louisville newspaper.

That item indicated that a

Special Agent of the Atlanta Office of the fBI was quoted

as saying he had made available,such a tape to Mrs. King.

Epstein said that story was wrong; the tape was sent from

Washington, D. C., by someone else. I asked him if he knew

the tape and he said he did.

I asked him

for the name of the person but he refused to give it to

me. In answer to a question, I told Epstein I was aware

of the existence of the tape.

The only discussion I could

recall concerning the use of the tape to expose King's

immoral activity was one I had with W. C. Sullivan when he

raised the question of whether it could somehow be made

public through the news media. 1 objected to this approach

and the matter was dropped.

Q.

Epstein asked me about a conference at the Seat of

Government with two Special Agents from the FBI Office

in Atlanta for the purpose of discussing ways to expose

King•

A. I dián't recall any such conference. However, Epstein

then showed me a memorandum which set out the details of

such a conference, together with a list of possible ways

in which King could be exposed.

Q.

Epstein then showed me anundated, uncaptioned page of

typing on plain bond paper.

He asked me to read it.

It was a diatribe against King and was full of dirty words

and bad language. Epstein asked me if I was familiar with

A. I told him I did not recall having seen it before. I

asked him where he got it.

he said it came Irom Bureau

fiLes.

I asked him if he

knew who wrote it. He smilingly

indicated that he did but he refused to tell me the name

of the person.

Q. Epstein asked the procedure we used in opening a Communist

infiltration case.

A. I coul't recall the exact criteria used to open such cases

but told him it would be necessary for us to have information

that the Communist Party had infiltrated an organization

before we would open such a case.

Epstein asked why was the FBI interested in the March on

Washington.

A.

I replied that the FBI had information that Stanley

Levison", a Communist, had consulted with king about the

march and had advised him.

Further, that there was a great

deal of communist Party activity throughout the country

in organtzing and urging people to participate in the march.

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

addition, Communist Party leaders and members planned

and did participate in the .arch and actually came to

Washington, D. C.

Q. At that point, Mark Gitenstein asked why did the FBI feel

that 200 Communists could come to Washington, D. C., and

take over the Government.

A. I replied that no one in the FBI thought the Communist

Party would take over the United States Government during

the March on Washington.

_ I taid him I thought he knew

that no one in the FBI had any such idea and I wanted

to know why he had

asked me such a question.

Mr. Gitenstein

knew that I was quite annoyed and he mumbled some half

apologetic answer.

Q. Epstein showed me a copy of a note from Director Hoover

on a memorandum, in which the Domestic Intelligence

Division was recommending the sending of instructions to

the field to make careful checks and open Communist

infiltration cases where warranted.

Director's note said since the Domestic Intelligence

Division had informed him there was no material Communist

Party activity in the March on Washington, he was not

going to expend time and money on such matters.

A. I told Epstein it appeared that the Director was upset

about something but that I had no independent recollection

of what it was.

Q. Epstein asked whether there was at that time a deep

division of opinion in the Bureau with the Domestic

Intelligence Division taking the position there was no

significant Communist activity in connection with the

March on Washington and the Director taking the position

there was.

A. I replied that there was no deep division of opinion in the

Bureau on this subject to my knowledge. I made the point

that the Domestic Intelligence Division had not been

ordered to change its mind by the Director and that in this

instance, as always, we reported factually on information.

Epst-in continued to refer to the Bureau's efforts to

expose King and indicated

he thought we had gone rather

far when we had furnished information about King

to the

Pope.

A. I replied I never thought we had furnished any information

to the Pope. Epstein then showed me a memorandum which

instructed SAC Malone of the New York Office to contact

Cardinal Cushing or Cardinal Spellman and brief them on

Ring in order that they could in turn

get the information

to the Pope. This action

grew out of

a trip King was

making to Europe and it was thought that he would see the

Pope at that time.

I pointed out to Epstein that although

the memorandum in

question had been sent up over my name,

I had in

fact not seen the memorandum inasmuch as someone

had initialled it for me.

He looked at the memorandum and

agreed and then asked who had initialled it.

I replied

it appeared to be either James Bland or Charles Brennan.

Epstein asked how the FBI knew Levison: was a Communist.

A. The FBI had reliable information that Levison. was

secret member of the Communist Party and was advising

King on important matters involving the activities of the

SCLC.

Q.

Epstein wanted to get into a detailed discussion concerning

Levison and his connection with the Communist Party.

A. I declined to be drawn into any such discussion on the basis

it might compromise Bureau sources.

Q. Epstein persisted in discussing the Levison. matter.

A. I asked him if he was going to show me a memorandum or a

case file on Levison: as he had on other matters he had

asked me about.

INTERVIEW RE THE SECURITY INDEX

At 1:30 p.m. on October 8, 1975, Staff Members

John I. Elliff, Mark Gitenstein,

Martha Talley, a recording

secretary whose name I didn't get, and I went to the office

of Senator Robert Morgan (NC), where I was sworn by the

Senator.

The Senatos appeared to be

somewhat ill at ease

and commented to me that "Times change." He explained that

if he or some other Senator was not present, I would not be

required to testify under oath unless I wished to.

He then

explained that he had to get back to the Capitol and he left.

The Staff Members, the recorder and I thon went to

the interviev

room.

Epstein asked me to read a lengthy memorandum which

compared the Department's criteria for Security Index subjects

with the FBI's criteria for Security Index subjects.

During

the course of the questioning, Epstein made available to me

five or six memoranda which ranged in time from 1949 to 1956

or 1957. All of these memoranda had to do with Security Index

matters.

Martha Talley opened the session by reading into the

record the "Advice of Rights". She did not ask me to sign the

"Advice of Rights".

When she

had finished reading, I

put into

the record an objection concerning the statement that

I was

voluntarily before

the Committee. I wanted the record to

clearly show that I was appearing at the insistence of the

Committee.

Elliff commented he couldn't see what difference

it made.

I told him it made a difference to me.

U. S. SENATE SELLCT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEY OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUNGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

A..

I replied that I entered the service in 1939, was transferred

into the seat of Government in 1942 or 1913, that I

supervised War Labor Disputes Act cases; that at or near

the end of World War II, I was transferred to the Internal

Security Section.

In 1946 or 1947, I was promoted to the

position of Number I Man in that section. In 1948 or 1949,

I. was made Chief of the Internal Security Section and remaine

in that position until I retired in 1966. I called attention

to the fact that the dates were to the best of my recollection

but that my service record would speak for itself concerning

the accurate dates.

Q. Talley asked me to explain the origin of the Security Index.

A. I told her it was in operation when I first came to the

Seat of Government and I could not furnish any information

an operation

concerning the history of the Security index.

Q. Elliff asked whether I approved the inclusion of names

in the Security Index.

A. I replied I thought I had done so. Gitenstein then remarked

something

to the effect, "I think we had better show him

this memo." He was referring to a memorandum he was holding

in his hands.

He then showed me the memorandum which

revealed that individual supervisors initialled forms

for including subjects' names in the Security Index.

The

case Agent's initials were countersigned by an experienced

Supervisor. I then stated

that apparently I had been wrong

when I recalled that I had approved the inclusion of

subjects'

names in the Security Index.

They then showed

me another memorandum to the effect that I should personally

approve certain Security Index subjects before their names

could be included in the Security Index. I

pointed out that

this was what I must have had in mind when I thought I

had approved

cases for the inclusion of the subject's name

in the Security Index.

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q.

With respect to the memorandum which compared Department

criteria for inclusion of subjects'

names

in

the Security

Index with Bureau criteria in that regard, Elliff asked

me if there was a dispute between the Department and the

Bureau concerning the criteria.

A. I told Elliff I had no independent recollection of such

a dispute although there could have been one.

Q. Talley asked why the FBI

had made a list of names of United

States citirins.

A. The purpose of the Security Index, to the best of my memory,

was so there would be available the names and addresses of

Communist Party members who were considered dangerous to

the internal security of the country in order that they

could be apprehended if such action became necessary during

a national emergency.

Q. How did the FBI decide what names to put in the Security

Index?

A. Members of the Communist Party were included in the Security

Index but I couldn't recall other breakdowns in the Index.

Q. How did you open Communist infiltration cases?

• A. I couidn't recall the criteria but if the Communist Party

had infiltrated an organization änd were influencing the

activities of the organization, we would open a Communist

infiltration case.

Q. Did the FBI use the Security Index to open cases? If a

Security Index subject attend the meeting of an organization,

would a Communist infiltration case be opened?

A. As far as I know, the iBl did not set up the security Index

in order to use it to open other cases. The mere attendance

of a Security Index subject at a meeting would not be

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE:

FRED J. BAUNGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

sufficient to cause the FBI to open a Communist infi?tration

case.

As I recall it, there would have to be information

that

the Communist Party had infiltrated the organization.

In addition,

the aims and purposes of the organization

itself might reflect Communist influences.

Q. If one Security Index subject attended a meeting, would

a Communist infiltration case be opened?

A. It wasn't a question of one or six Security Index subjects

attending a meeting. The FBI utilized its experience in

applying

the criteria we had for opening such cases.

From time to time, Gitenstein and Elliff would go off

the record for a discussion of matters of which I had no

independent recollection.

I tried to make it clear that the

main

thrust of the Security Index was to have available the

internal security of the country in order that they could be

detained in the event of a national emergency.

Q. Talley asked if the apprehension program would be initiated

on the basis of a memorandum prepared by a Special Agent

of the FBI.

A. I told her that the program of apprehension would not be

initiated in that way.

I explained that the FBI would

receive orders from the Attorney General in this regard.

I told her that there was a prepared set of rules called

a Portfolio which outlined the

steps to be taken in order

to put the program into operation.

Q. Elliff asked if consideration had ever been given to

putting the Security Index into operation.

A. I replied that on one occasion, Carl Hennrich, Assistant

to A. H. Belmont, had asked me to come to his office to

discuss

putting

the program into operation.

Q. When did this occur?

A. I don't remember the year.

V. INTELLIGINCE ACTIVITIES (S8C)

RE: INTERVIEN OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS .

Q. Talley asked if any review was ever made of the Security

Index.

A. Yes. The cases were under constant review and great care

was exercised to make certain that names were deleted from

the Security index wh 1 such action was warranted.

Near the end of the questioning, ellifi showed me

a memorandum dated in 1955 which Nr. Tolson had sent to the

Director.

In this memorandum, Mir. Tolson commented that the

FBI had tried to get the Departmeni to review all Security

Index cases without success.

He pointed out that we were

including names of people who would be apprehended in the event

the program was ever made operational. He was concerned about

this because in every other type of case, Departmental Attorneys

or United States Attorneys in the field made the determination

concerning apprehension.

He felt it was a heavy burden for the

Bureau to carry this responsibility with respect to the security

Index. Mr. Tolson recommended that the cases, or at least

certain of ther:, be approved by several people including me

and Belmont (A. H. Belmont, Assistant Director).

I told Elliff

• I had no independent recollection of

this memorandum and could not add anything to what Mr. Tolson

had

written.

BACKGROUND

I was first contacted by Mike Epstein, SSC Staff

Member, in April/ 1975.

Tentative arrangements

were made for

Epstein to come to Louisville, Kentucky, to conduct the

interview. I contacted the Bureau and

I was advised that a

current Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

(FBI) would be made available to sit in on the interview if

I requested it. Such a request was made and the Bureau so

advised Epstein. Subsequently, Epstein called me and asked

whether I had requested someone from the Bureau to sit in

on the interview.

I replied that I had, and Epstein hung up

the phone.

No further contact was made

with me until late

in September, 1975. At that time, Martha Talley, SSC Staff

Member, called me requesting that

I testify in Washington,

D. C.

After I discussed this matter with the Bureau,

I made

arrangements with Martha Talley to appear before Staff Members

of the Committee in Washington, D. C., on October 8, 1975.

The next day, after these arrangements were completed,

Martha Talley called and advised me that I would be testifying

under oath and that I could request to be represented by an

attorney.

No such request was made.

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

At approximately 10:00 a.m., October 8, 1975, 1

was interviewed by the following named SSC Staff

Members:

Mike Epstein, Mark Gitenstein, Mary De Oreo, Martha Talley,

and one other Staff Member whose name I cannot recall.

Epstein

began the interview by handing me a typed sheet captioned

"Advice of Rights".

He asked me to read and sign that sheet.

After reading it, I declined to sign it. Epstein stated he

didn't understand my reluctance to sign the "Advice of Rights"

form inasmuch as the FBI always did this when they conducted

interviews.

Epstein was corrected on this statement and was

told that the FBI did not require every interviewee to sign

an "Advice of Rights" statement unless the interview involved

a possible violation of the law on the part of the person

being interviewed. Thousands of interviews are conducted by

the FBl where it would be completely out of place to advise

people that statements they might make could be used against

them

Epstein then indicated that unless

the "Advice of Rights" form was signed, no interview would be

conducted.

I replied that I had come to Washington at the

insistence of the Committee, I was present, was available and

willing to go through

with the interview but I would not sign

the "Advice of Rights" form. One point in the form stated

that the interviewee had appeared voluntarily for interview.

I made the point the I had not come voluntarily but had come

only at the insistence of the Committee.

At the beginning of the interview, Epstein handed

me two or three memoranda.

During the course of the interview,

he let me read several other memoranda. In all, he made

available to me a total of 12 memorandums, the captions and

dates of which are set out as follows:

1) F. J. Baumgardner to W. C. Sullivan, dated

August 22, 1963, "March on Washington".

2) F. J. Baumgardner to W. C. Sullivan, dated

August 29, 1963, "March on Washington"

The questions posed to me by the Staff Members

revolved around the information which appeared in the above

listed memoranda. I took no notes of the questioning and

cannot set forth

the questions and answers in the order in

which they were asked. However, I will set out as many of

the questions, together with my

answers, as I can recall.

Practically all of the questions were asked by Mike Epstein.

I am unable to quote the exact questions and my exact answers;

however, I will set out the gist of the questions and my

answers

as best I can recall them.

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

•Q. Why did the FBI open a case on Martin Luther King and

the SCLC?

A. To the best of my recollection, some Communists were in

the headquarters of the SCLC.

communist Party member was exerting influence on king.

Since King made policy decisions for the SCLC, the FBI

had the responsibility to determine whether this important

organization was being used by the Communist Party for

its own purposes.

Q. When and why did the Bureau change from a Communist

infiltration investigation to an effort to expose King?

A. We had developed information concerning King's moral conduct

which indicated a vulnerability on his part and since the

Communists were exerting influence on him, it appeared to

be in the best interest of the country from a security

standpoint.

Q. Did you know a tape of activity concerning King and others,

which took place at the Washington Hotel, was sent to

Mrs. King?

A. I don't recall any such incident and the first I can recall

about it was a news item which appeared a few weeks ago

in a Louisville newspaper.

That item indicated that a

Special Agent of the Atlanta Office of the FBI was quoted

as saying he had made available such a tape to Mrs. King.

Epstein said that story was wrong; the tape was sent from

Washington, D. C., by someone else. I asked him if he knew

who had taken the tape and he said he did. I asked him

for the name of the person but he refused to give it to

me. In answer to a question, I told Epstein I was

aware

of the existence of the tape.

The only discussion I could

recall concerning the use of the tape to expose King's

immoral activity was one I had with W. C. Sullivan when he

raised the question of whether it could somehow be made

public through the news media. I objected to this approach

and the matter

was

dropped.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q. Epstein asked me about a conference at the Seat of

Government with two Special Agents from the FBI Office

in Atlanta for the purpose of discussing ways to expose

King.

A. I didn't recall

any such conferences. However, Epstein

then showed me a memorandum which set out the details of

such a conference, together with a list of possible ways

in which King could be exposed.

Q.

Epstein then showed me an undated, uncaptioned page of

typing on plain bond paper.

He asked me to read it.

It was a diatribe against King and was full of dirty words

and

bad language. Epstein asked me if I was familiar with

it.

A. I told him I did not recall having seen it before.

asked him where he got it. He said it came from Bureau

files.

I asked him if he knew who wrote it. He smilingly

indicated that he did but he refused to tell me the name

of the person.

Q. Epstein asked the procedure we used in opening a Communist

infiltration case.

A. I couln't recall the exact criteria used to open such cases

but told him it would be necessary for us to have information

that the Communist Party had infiltrated an organization

before we would open such a case.

Q.

Epstein asked why was the FBI interested in the March on

Washington.

A.

I replied that the FBI had information that Stanley

Levanson, a Communist, had consulted with King about the

march and had advised him. Further, that there was a great

deal of Communist Party activity throughout the country

in organizing and urging people to participate in the march.

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

@.

In addition, Communist Party leaders and members planned

and did participate in the march and actually came to

Washington, D. C.

At that point, Mark Gitenstein asked why did the FBI feel

that 200 Communists could come to Washington, D. C., and

take over the Government.

I replied that no one in the FBI thought the Communist

Party would take over the United States Government during

the March on Washington.

I told him I thought he knew

that no one in the FBI had any such idea and I wanted

to know why he had asked me such a question. Mr. APStEHENSTEIN

knew that I was quite annoyed and he mumbled some half

apologetic answer.

Q.

Epstein showed me a copy of a note from Director Hoover

on a memorandum, in which the Domestic Intelligence

Division was recommending the sending of instructions to

the field to make careful checks and open Communist

infiltration cases where warranted. In effect, the

Director's note said since the Domestic Intelligence

Division had informed him there was no material Communist

Party activity in the March on Washington, he was not

going to expend time and money on such matters.

A.

I told Epstein it appeared that the Director was upset

about something but that I had no independent recollection

of what it was.

Q.

Epstein asked whether there was at that time a deep

division of opinion in the Bureau with the Domestic

Intelligence Division taking the position there was no

significant Communist activity in connection with the

March on Washington and the Director taking the position

there was.

A. I replied that there was no deep division of opinion in the

Bureau on this subject to my knowledge. I made the point

that the Domestic Intelligence Division had not been

ordered to change its mind by the Director and that in this

instance, as always, we reported factually on information

developed.

Q. Epstein continued to refer to the Bureau's efforts to

expose King and indicated he thought we had gone rather

far when we had furnished information about King to the

Pope.

A. I replied I never thought we had furnished any information

to the Pope. Epstein then showed me a memorandum which

instructed SAC Malone of the New York Office to contact

Cardinal Cushing or Cardinal Spellman and brief them on

King in order that they could in turn get the information

to the Pope. This action grew out of a trip King was

making to Europe and it was thought that he would see the

Pope at that time.

the memorandum in question had been sent up over my name,

I had in fact not seen the memorandum inasmuch as someone

had initialled it for me. He looked at the memorandum and

agreed and then asked who had initialled it. I replied

it appeared to be either James Bland or Charles Brennan.

Q.

Epstein asked how the FBI knew Levitson was a Communist.

A.

The FBl had reliable information that Levinson was

secret member of the Communist Party and was advising

King on important matters involving the activities of the

SCLC.

Q.

Epstein wanted to get into a detailed discussion concerning

Levinson and his connection with the Communist Party.

A.

I declined to be drawn into any such discussion on the basis

it might compromise Bureau sources.

Q.

A.

Epstein persisted in discussing the Levinson

matter.

he was going to show me

a memorandum or a

case file on Levinson as he had on other matters he had

asked me about.

INTERVIEW RE THE SECURITY INDEX

At 1:30 p.m. on October 8, 1975, Staff Members

John I. Elliff, Mark

Gitenstein, Martha Talley, a recording

secretary whose name I didn't get, and I went to the office

of Senator Robert Morgan (NC),

where I was sworn by the

Senator.

The Senator appeared to be

somewhat ill at ease

and commented to me that "Times change." He explained that

ifhhe or some other Senator was not present, I would not be

required to testify under oath unless I wished to.

explained that he had to get back to the Capitol and he left.

The Staff Members, the recorder and I then went to the interview

/ room.

Epstein asked me to read a lengthy memorandum which

compared the Department's criteria for Security Index subjects

with the FBI's criteria for Security Index subjects.

During

the course of the questioning, Epstein made available to me

five or six memoranda which ranged in time from 1949 to 1956

or 1957. All of these memoranda had to do with security Index

matters.

Martha Talley opened the session by reading into the

record the "Advice of Rights".

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

A.

I replied that I entered the service in 1939, was transferred

into the Seat of Government in 1942 or 1943, that I

supervised War Labor Disputes Act cases; that at or near

the end of World War II, I was transferred to the Internal

Security Section. In 1946 or 1947, I was promoted to the

position of Number 1 Man in that section.

In 1948 or 1949.

I was made Chief of the Internal Security Section and remained

in that position until I retired in 1966. I called attention

to the fact that the dates were to the best of my recollection

but that my service record would speak for itself concerning

the

accurate dates.

Q. Talley asked me to explain the origin of the Security Index.

A. I told her it was in operation when I first came to the

Seat of Government and I could not furnish any information

concerning the history of the Security Index.

Q. Elliff asked whether I approved the inclusion of names

in the Security Index.

A.

I replied I thought I had

Supervisor.

I then stated that apparently I had been wrong

when I recalled that I had approved the inclusion of

subjects' names in the Security Index.

They then showed

me another memorandum to the effect that I should personally

approve certain Security Index subjects before their names

could be included in the Security Index. I pointed out that

this was what I must have had in mind when I thought I

had approved cases for the inclusion of the subject's name

in the Security Index.

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q. With respect to the memorandum which compared Department

criteria for inclusion of subjects' names in the Security

Index with Bureau criteria in that regard, Elliff asked

me if there was a dispute between the Department and the

Bureau concerning the criteria.

A. I told Elliff I had no independent recollection of such

a dispute although there could have been one.

Q. Talley asked why the FBI had made a list of names of United

States citizens.

A. The purpose of the Security Index, to the best of my memory,

was so there would be available the names and addresses of

Communist Party members who were considered dangerous to

the internal security of the country in order that they

could be apprehended if such action became necessary during

a national emergency.

Q. How did the FBI decide what names to put in the Security

Index?

A. Members of the Communist Party were included in the Security

Index but I couldn't recall other breakdowns in the Index.

Q. How did you open Communist infiltration cases?

A. I couldn't recall the criteria but if the Communist Party

had infiltrated an organization and were influencing the

activities of the organization, we would open a Communist

infiltration case.

Q. Did the FBI use the Security Index to open cases? If a:

Security Index subject attend the meeting of an organization,

would a Communist infiltration case be opened?

A.

As far as I know, the FBl did not set up the security Index

in order to use it to open other cases. The mere attendance

of a Security Index subject at a meeting would not be

In addition, the aims and purposes of the organization

itself might reflect Communist influences.

Q. If one Security Index subject attended a meeting, would

a Communist infiltration case be opened?

A. It wasn't a question of one or six Security Index subjects

attending a meeting.

The FBI utilized its experience in

applying the criteria we had for opening such cases.

From time to time, Gitenstein and Elliff would go off

the record for a discussion of matters of which I had no

I tried to make it clear that the

main thrust of the Security Index was to have available the

names and addresses of people who would be dangerous to the

internal security of the country in order that they could be

detained in the event of a national emergency.

Q. Talley asked if the apprehension program would be initiated

on the basis of a memorandum prepared by a Special Agent

of the FBI.

A. I told her that the program of apprehension would not be

initiated in that way.

I explained that the fBl would

receive orders from the Attorney General in this regard.

I told her that there was a prepared set of rules called

a Portfolio which outlined the steps to be taken in order

to put the program into operation.

Q.

Elliff asked if consideration had ever been given to

putting the Security Index into operation.

A. I replied that on one occasion, Carl HInnrich, Assistant

to A. H. Belmont, had asked me

to comelto his

office to

discuss putting the program into operation.

Q. When did this occur?

A. I don't remember the year.

Q. Talley asked if any review was ever made of the Security

A. Yes. The cases were under constant review and great care

was exercised to make certain that names were deleted fron

the Security Index when such action was warranted.

Near the end of the questioning, Elliff showed me

a memorandum dated in 1955 which Mr. Tolson had sent to the

Director.

In this memorandum, Mr. Tolson commented that the

FBI had tried to get the Department to review all Security

Index cases without success.

He pointed out that we were

including names of people who would be apprehended in the event

the program was ever made operational. He was concerned about

this because in every other type of case, Departmental Attorneys

or United States Attorneys in the

field made the determination

concerning apprehension. He felt it was a heavy burden for the

Bureau to carry this responsibility with respect to the Security

Index. Mr. Tolson recommended that the cases, or at least

certain of them, be approved by several people including me

and Belmont (A. H. Belmont, Assistant Director).

I told Elliff I had no independent recollection of

this memorandum and could not add anything to what Mr. Tolson

had written.
