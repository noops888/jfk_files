Interview

tie FBI Case Agent For John Roselli

October 20, 1977

On Thursday, October 9, 1977, I interviewed retired

FBI agent, Wayne Hill, who shared the responsibility of

covering John Roselli with a fellow agent, Harold Dodge.

The results of the interview are summarized

in the following

categories:

A. Electronic Surveillance

• Roselli was the subject of two electronic surveillances

placed at his apartment in cresent Heights he intercepts were

Angeles, Calif.

and the Diplomat in Las Vegas, Nevada.

done in the early 1960's but

were of a poor quality. due to an

inferior microphone location.

Also, Roselli was extremely

cautious in discussing his business activities and preferred

discussions outside of his home.

Transcripts exist of the

"overhears" and should be available at the Bureau.

and

surveillance begun, a "special employee"

once permission for the interception Walerkytanscribe

the tapes which were supposed to be reviewed by the case agent

for errors.. The "fruitful" information was sent to the

Washington headquarters and

a periodic summary was prepared as

to the progress of the

"tap" and the need to continue the

project.

These records should also be available along with

the

Bureau's commentary.

•B. Physical Surveillance

Roselli's activities were monitored rather successfully

due to the combination of the electronic "plant", and a high-

level mob informant (deceased) •

For example following a trip from the latter source

the FBI covered a meeting in the early 1960's in Richmond, Va.,

between Roselli and an individual whom the FBI later identifiec

as a CIA official. The Los Angeles FBI office was subsequently

informed by Washington that. Roselli was being utilized as a

"go-between" with Giancana for Cuban intelligence gathering

purposes only.

The close contact of Roselli and the CIA surfaced again

in the late 1960's when the FBI attempted to recruit Roselli

as an informant after they had obtained evidence that Roselli

had forged his birth certificate to disguise his true identity

as Filippe Sacco.

Roselli's response was to contact his

attorney, James P. Cantillon, and then William Harvey of the

CIA. Harvey approached Sam Papich, the FBI liaison, to discover

what information the Bureau possessed and their prosecutorial

intentions.

C. Roselli's Death

In 1971 Roselli was subpoened before a Federal Grand

Jury in Los Angeles and

testified concerning certain Mafia

activities in Los Vegas. Word of his testimony filtered back

to Chicago and Frank LaPorte,: Roselli's capa, came to Los

Angeles to discuss the situation.

with LaPorte but left a letter for him at Cantillan's office

indicating that he was not really co-operating. LaPorte was

furious with Roselli and the subsequent subpoena of Paul Ricca

and Tony Accardo did not help Roselli's situation.

When Anthony Giancana of St. Louis was indicted in the

Frontier Hotel case, he blamed Roselli for the Government's

knowledge of his "hidden interest" in the Frontier Hotel.

Informant information obtained by the FBI in 1977 indicated

that Giancana had stated that "Roselli's Detroits problem, but

he is going to get it"

• A subsequent statement was that the

Chicago organization would take care of Roselli and use someone

like Santo Trafficante to set it up."

Apparently Roselli was to meet with Trafficante the

day that he disappeared although the details of the telephone

call to Roselli on that day were not known to S/A Hill.

Details of Roselli's criminal involvements and CIA

connections were detailed in a comprehensive intelligence

memorandum prepared by S/A Hill in 1976.

His recommendation

was that the Committee obtain that memo with the administrative

pages intact which would enable us to zero in on the relevant

documents and witnesses.

D. Investigative Leads

According to S/A Hill, two individuals with relevant

information might be the attorney, Jim Cantillion who is

presently awaiting sentencing in Orange County, California on

an aggravated assault-attempted murder connection.

Also, Tonỳ Spilotio of Chicago who would have

knowledge of

the Giancana and Roselli "hits."

Another good source of information would be the case

agents assigned to the major hoodlums service, their careers

were dedicated to surveilling these individuals.
