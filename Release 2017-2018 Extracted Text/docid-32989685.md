administration the net salary plus federal and state payroll

taxes from various OlD programo were deposited into a special

ost payroll account at the stockman National Bank. the

money in this account was used to pay salaries of persons

working for the varlous 0EO programs and was supposed to be

used to pay federal and state payroll taxes.

For many months

prior to the WILSON administration, the federal and state

payroll tax reports were not filed by the OST treasurer under

the ONc FLatHer administration.

As & result of this, the

monies in the special OST payroll account gradually built up

to a balance of approximately $230, 000. About this time the

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came in and audited the payroll

of the various DEO programs which were being paid by che cst.

As a result of this IRs audit, the IRs assessed the

CST at an

amount exceeding the $230,000

balance which had built up in

the special OST payroll account.

The OST used the entire

balance of the $230,000 in the special payroll account and

also had to borrow money from the Stockman National Bank

and the OEO in order to pay the IRs the back payroll tax

assessment.

Since the WILSON administration took over, the

special OST payroll account has been operating very smoothly,

and all federal and state payroll taxes have been filed

timely by EulA NELSON.

The IRS in Rapid City, South Dakota is the office

that conducted the audit of the OST payroll. They can

furnish more detailed information concerning this matter.

In the past WILSON has been involved in what some

people might call "shady deals" but since he became president

of the OST, JOHNSON believes that WILSON is conducting the

altairs of OST honest and completely above board.

WILSON

is no more honest or dishonest than was GERALD ONE FEATHER

or any of the other Tribal presidents over the past many years.

me First National Bank of Gordon, Nebraska

maintains various checking accounts of the

OST involving

their programs with the oro.

The tribe is supposed to file the appropriate Federal and

state withholding

tax reports

and

state unemploymen

tax reports and pay the taxes which were withheld from

the employee's salary from the monies,

which is given

to them by OEO from

the specified

special project fund.

The Sioux Tribal Headquarters has not been filing these

tax reports.

About one year ago, the Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) came to Pine Ridge and audited the various

small projects on which the tribe was supposed to file

payroll tax reports.

The IRS audit resulted in the tir

Jund having to pay several thousand dollars in back x:.r011

taxes for these various special projects which the trive

had

failed to file payroll tax reports for.

The trzie

received the money from the CAP Lund to pay

these taxes

but did not do so.

The special projects heretofore referred

to

wherein OEO submitted monies to the tribe for salaries

plus withholding tax are the "Community Action Program",

"Parent-Child Center"

, and "Headstart."

charge tickets are to be paid out of the OEO "Emergeic?

Food and Medidal Services Fund" (EFMSF). The persons who

have signed for groceries and charged them to the ErNSE

but who are not authorized by OED to do so are:

I) ANTHONY BRAVE; 2) DELORES APPLE; 3) TIM SEANGREAU.

These three persons should not be spending money out d

the FEisI account.

The total amount expended for grocezies

on March 27, 28 and 29, 1973, by the above-mentioned persons

is $127.19. None of these people work for oro.

BRYAN BREWER, Teachers Corp. Intern, telephone

number 867-5191, was interviewed at the Oglala Cormunity

school, at which time he provided the following information:

He resides in a white trailer home on the left

hand side of route 18 approximately four miles east of Pine

Ridge, South Dakota. His date of birth is February 4, 1947.

He held the position of Program Director, Indian

Action Team (IAT) from August 1, 1973, until he resigned

on July 12, 1974.

Last year he realized approximately $110,000.00

of IAT funds was budgeted but probably would not be used. "

In January, 1974, he conferred with the Bureau of Indian

Affairs (BIA) Technical Assistance Center in Denver,

Colorado, regarding his desire to establish a Cement Batch

Plant run by the tribe. BIA approved the project based upon

a subsequent approval by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.

In the same month the Tribal Council approved the project

and passed a resolution to that

effect.

In approximately February, 1974, he mentioned

to DICK WILSON, Oglala Sioux Tribal President, he had sent

JOE BLUE HORSE tO Denver, Colorado, to purchase a truck

for the Cement Batch Plant. WILSON "ordered " him to

recall BLUE. HORSE and not to purchase a truck as he

(WILSON) was buying a truck and the Cement Batch Plant

was to buy all gravel from him (WILSCN). The gravel, he

noted, was a crushed limestone.

He hired IKE BETTELYCUN to operate the Batch

Plant. WIISON's men, under the name Lakota Sand and Gevel

Company (Lakota), owned by RICHARD (MANNIE) WILSON, JR..

DICK WILSON's son, began to haul the gravel. He noted

WILSON, previous to this, had the Oglala Sioux Tribal

Council pass a resolution stating all tribal businesses

must purchase materials from other tribal businesses, if

available.

However, he personally observed on many occasions

Lakota using a Government trailer and a Government truck

to haul the gravel.

He knew they were Government vehicles

as the vehicles had Government license plates. He also

knew the delivery was to the Batch Plant, not a BIA project

inasmuch as the vehicles were observed by him delivering

_gravel

to the Batch Plant gravel pit. STANLEY

WALKER,

Superintendent, BIA Roads Department, authorized IAT to

utilized Government vehicles not in use; he was not sure

if Lakota was authorized to use the vehicles.

He kept copies of 69 delivery tickets which

were submittea to him by DICK WILSON, JR., OF DICK WILSON,

SR., while he was with IAT. The delivery tickets represent

gravel obtained from Hills Material Company, Hot Springs,

south Dakota, by Lakota and all were dated june, 1974.

IAT paid these and subsequent bills. The total

amount. for

the 69 deliveries was approximately $3,450.00. The invoice

numbers of the 69 delivery tickets were as follows:

The payment to Hills Material Company was for the

cost of gravel. Lakota also charged IAT for the gravel,

$2.00 a ton, and for delivery, $5.00 a ton, on the insiructions

Of DICK WILSON, SR.

These bills vere presented to FLOYD (BILL)PULLIUM

who paid them with an IAT check." The checks were payable

to Hills Material Company and Lakota.

In early july, 1974, he was talking to LEWIS PRYOR,

Plant Manager, BIA, Pine Riâge, South Dakota, who told him

BIA was also paying Lakota for gravel. He surmised the

payment by BIA was for the same graval. IAT paid for as there

were no other projects he knew of at that time requiring

gravel.

He heard in July, 1974, source not recalled,

BILL CUNY paid DICK WILSON or Lakota $10,000.00 for leveling tvc

industrial lots for the Cement Batch Plant when neither

WILSONnor Lakota actually did the work. The leveling was

completed in May, 1974, by IAT.

FLOYD E. TAYLOR, Representative, Economic Development

Administration (ELA), Department of Commerce, Pierre,

South Dakota,

was telephonically contacted at (605) 224-1238, at which time he

provided the following information:

The EDA recently approved a grant of $610,000 to the

Oglala Sioux Indian Tribe for street improvements at Pine Ridge;

South Dakota. The improvements consist of curb and gutter

construction as well as the paving of streets.

however,

to date

no disbursements have been made by EDA. Disbursements will be made

upon the receiving of final specifications and plans.

The firm which was awarded the contract as prime

contractor was Dakota Contracting, Incorporated, Sioux Falls,

South Dakota. Dakota Contracting,

Inc., submitted the lowest bid

and was approved based upon experience, capability and know how:

a performance bond was also required.

Eda is not aware of the sub-contractors employed by

Contracting,

Inc., is a private concern with a profit motive in mind.

Dakota

Contracting Inc., must absorb any excessive costs including those

from sub-contractors.

The Tribe was the applicant for the paving project.

When the project is completed the Tribe will be the sole owner,

operator and maintainer of the completed construction.

The funds

when disbursed will not be made directly to the Tribe

but will be

submitted to a bank in increments based upon the submission of

vouchers and receipts of work. The monies when disbursed will be

deposited into a

"special account"

the title of which will

spell out the road construction project in Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

No disbursements will bemade to an account in the name of the Tribe

or in the name of

an individual. Disbursements are purposely made to

"special accounts"

as it is EDA policy not to mix those funds with

their Tribal funds.

Date of transcriplion_.

BRYAN BREWER, Teachers Corp. Intern, telephone

number 867-5191, was interviewed at the Oglala Community

school, at which time he provided the following information:

He resides in a white trailer home on the left

hand side of route 18 approximately four miles east of Pine

Ridge, South Dakota. His date of birth is February 4, 1947.

He held the position of Program Director, Indian

Action Team (IAT) from August 1, 1973, until he resigned

on July 12, 1974.

Last year he realized approximately $110,000.00

Of IAT funds was budgeted but probably would not be used.

In January, 1974, he conferred with the Bureau of Indian

Affairs (BIA) Technical Assistance Center in Denver,

Colorado, regarding his desire to establish a Cement Batch

Plant run by the tribe. BIA approved the project basea upon

a subsequent approval by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.

In the same month the Tribal Council approved the project

and passed a resolution to that

effect.

In approximately February, 1974, he mentioned

to DICK WILSON, Oglala Sioux Tribal President, he had sent

JOE BLUE HORSE tO Denver, Colorado, to purchase a truck

for the Cement Batch Plant. WILSON "ordered " him to

recall BLUE. HORSE and not to purchase a truck as he

(WILSON) was buying a truck and the Cement Batch Plant

was to buy all gravel from him (WILSCN). The gravel, he

noted, was a crushed limestone.

He hired IKE BETTELYCUN to operate the Batch

Plant. WIISON's men, under the name Lakota Sand and Gravel

Company (Lakota), owned by RICHARD (MANNIE) WILSON, JR.,

DICK WILSON's son, began to haul the gravel. He noted

WILSON, previous to this, had the Oglala Sioux Tribal

Council pass a resolution stating all tribal businesses

must purchase materials from other tribal businesses, if

available.

However, he personally observed on many occasions

Lakota using a Government trailer and a Government truck

to haul the gravel.

He knew they were Government vehicles

as the vehicles had Government license plates. He also

knew the delivery was to the Batch Plant, not a BIA project

inasmuch as the vehicles were observed by him delivering

-.gravel

to the Batch Plant gravel pit. STANLEY

WALKER,

Superintendent, BIA Roads Department, authorized IAT to

utilized Government vehicles not in use; he was not sure

if lakota was authorized to use the vehicles.

He kept copies of 69 delivery tickets which

were submittea to him by DICK WILSON, JR., Or DICK WILSON,

SR., while he was with IAT. The delivery tickets represent

gravel obtained from Hills Material Company, Hot Springs,

south Dakota, by lakota and all were dated June, 1974.

IAT' paid these and subsequent bills. The total

amount for

the 69 deliveries was approximately $3,450.00. The invoice

The payment to Hills Material Company was for the

cost of gravel. Lakota also charged IAT for the gravel,

$2.00 a ton, and for delivery, $5.00 a ton, on the instructions

Of DICK WILSON, SR.

These bills were presented to FLOYD (BILL)PULLIUM

who paid them with an IAT check." The checks were payable

to Fills Material Company and Lakota.

In early july, 1974, he was talking to LEWIS PRYOR,

Plant Manager, BIA, Pine Riage, South Dakota, who told hai

BIA was also paying Lakota for gravel. He surmised the

payment by BIA was for the same gravel. IAT paid for as there

were no other projects he knew of at that time requiring

gravel.

He heard in July, 1974, source not recalled,

BILL CUNY paid DICK WILSON

or Lakota $10,000.00 for Leveling

industrial lots for the Cement Batch Plant when neither

WILSONnOT Lakota actually did the work. The leveling was

completed in May, 1974, by IAT.

FLOYD E. TAYLOR, Representative, Economic Development

Administration (EDA), Department of Commerce, Pierre, South Dakota,

was telephonically contacted at (605) 224-1238, at which time he

The EDA recently approved a grant of $610,000 to the

glala Sioux Indian Tribe for street improvements at Pine Ridge,

South Dakota. The improvements consist of curb and gutter

construction

as well as the paving of streets. However,

to date

no disbursements have been made by EDA. Disbursements will be made

• upon the receiving of final specifications and plans.

The firm which was awarded the contract as prime

South Dakota.

a performance bond was also required.

EDA is not aware of the sub-contractors employed by

Dakota Contracting, Inc., but Dakota Contracting, Inc., would award

sub-contracts to the lowest bidders inasmuch as Dakota Contracting,

Inc., is a private concern with a profit motive in mind.

Dakota

Contracting Inc., must absorb any excessive costs including those

from sub-contractors.

The Tribe was the applicant for the paving project.

When the project is completed the Tribe will be the sole owner,

operator and maintainer of the completed construction.

The funds

when disbursed will not be made directly to the Tribe

but will be

submitted to a bank in increments based upon the submission of

vouchers and receipts of work.

The monies when disbursed will be

deposited into a

special account"

the title of which will

spell out the road construction project in Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

No disbursements will bemade to an account in the name of the Tribe

or in the name of

an individual. Disbursements are purposely made to

"special accounts" as it is EDA policy not to mix those funds with

their Tribal funds.

The Tribe initiated the soliciting of bids through

the professional engineers

Dana, Larson and Roubal and Associates,

Fierre, South Dakota.

Although no EDA äisbursements have been made to date

he believed interim financing was obtained by the Tribe through a

bank.

Interim financing is normally obtained

seant.

The interin financing account, if it does exist, would

, and would not exceed 1% of the grant.

These monies would be disbursed by the bank on the basis of receipts

and vouchars and would be audited by iDA at the end of the

project.

Interest expensa charged by the bank would be paid by EDA.

GERALD ONE FEATHER, Oglala Sioux Tribal Chief

Since RICHARD WILSON became president of the

Oglala sious Tribe in January, 1972, ONE FEATHER has beer

working with both the American Indian kovement (alM and the

Oglala Sioux Tribal Council In an effort to improve the crimiaal

justice system and the financial status of the Oglala Slour

Tribe on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

ONE FLATHER suspects Chairman WILSON Of maDy

wrongdoings since becoming chief of the Oglala Stow Tribe,

but he has no direct proof or evidence which could be used

against WILSON in a court of law.

Sinca WILSON became

president, he has suspended and fired many competent

people who vere associated with the Tribal Council because

these paople would not cooperate with WILSON in carrying

out various "deal" which WILSON was trying to do.

Interviewed on

WILSON suspended the Office of Economic Opportunity

(OEO) Headstart Director HATTIE THISS, because she would not

cooperate with

WILSON concerning the payment of approximately

ten to fifteen thousand dollars to WILSON's brother, JAMES

5. WILSON, 10r some type of consulting lees be received

through the Headstart program.

TWISS can be located at the

hospital in Gordon, Nebraska.

Since WILSON took office in January, 1972, the

books and

records for the Oglala Sloux Tribe have not been

audited and according to soveral members of the Tribal

Council, the records which are currently being kept are

very inadequato.

During the ONE FEATHER administration, the

accounting firm of Thorstanson and Sayler In Rapid City

was responsible for auditing the books and records of the

Oglaja Stoux Trive. AlSO, an accountant nazod FBANCIS

KILLER, who llves in Vermillion, South Dakota, and whose tele-

phone number is 642-4963, was under a contract with the Tribe

to do monthly accounting work for the Tribe. Illin's contraet

with the Tribo expired in October, 1972, and WILSON would not

renew his contract.

HATTIE TWISS, Rocky Fort Route, Porcupine, South

vakota, was interviewed at the Gordon memorial hospital,

Gordon, Nebraska and provided the following Information:

She was Director for the Office of Economic

Opportunity (OED) Headstart Program until October, 1972,

at which time she resigned because oi wrongdoings on the

part Of RICHARD WILSON, President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe

(OST) .

WILSON was trying to get access to the Headstart

funds

which she controlled but she would not allow him

access to the funds.

During the first part of October, 1972, she

became ill and had to go into the hospital

for a week. When

She returned to work she discovered that WILSON had drawn

$14,000 Irom the Headstart account. There was no allowance

IOT

this withdrawal at the Headstart project and WILSON

would not account for what the $14,000 was spent for.

The

check that was written for the $14,000 bore HATTIE THISS'

signature,

but she did not sign the check.

At this point,

she was led up with the way WILSON was operating and

barrassing her, so she turned in her resignation.

She could furnish no details concerning the payment

os $10,000 to $15,000 to WILSON's brother, JAMES WILSON;

however, FRANCIS KILLER Of Vermillion, South Dakota has

the dtails surrounding this payment.

KILLER was the

accountant for the Ost at the time this disbursement was

supposedly made to WILSON's brother.

There has been much wrongdoing on the part of

DICK WILSON since he took office in April, 1972. He has

continuously attempted to gain control of the various Oro

funds, and used these funds for purposes which would not

benefit the sioux people.

DAVE LONG, vice president of the OST, can furnish

additional Information concerning wrongdoing on the part of

RICHARD WILSON.

and LEROY B. CATEL, CPA, partners in the firm of Sayler,

Thorstenson and Company, Certified Public Accountants,

810 Quincy Street, Rapid City (telephone 342-5630),

provided the following intormation:

The accounting services which sayler, thorstenson

and Company provide for the Oglala Sioux Iribe

(OST)

are yearly audits of the following OST special programs:

Revolving Crodit Fund - this fund borzows

money from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and re-loans

this money to various tribal enterprises and indivduals;

2. Short Term Loan Program - this fund makes

small loans, usually less than $250, to individuals of

the OST;

3. Land Acquisition Interprise - this fund

purchases land within the boundaries of the Pine Ridge

Reservation.

The last audit conducted on the aforementioned-

thros funds was in June, 1972. The findings of all prior

audits of these funds has always resulted in either a

qualified or a disclaimer of opinion for the audit.

The

primary reason that all the audits have been qualifled

and/or disclaimer

opinions is because of the

tardiness

of the recordkeeping of the above-three funds. However,

a iust-scale audit has always been conducted and in this

capacity, the auditing standards

been utiiizod would have uncovared any misappropriation,

fraud or embezzlement which night have been taking place

in those funds.

OST Chairman DICK WILSON has no control or for

that matter any influence over the above funds and because

of the nature of those lunds and the checks and balances

which are placed upon these funds, it is not Ilkely that

any ixregularities might occur in

these funds.

Synopsis:

EMBEZZLEMENT OF INDIAN PROPERTY

On 10/3/69 telephonic complaint was received from

Agency Special Officer, Pine Ridge, S.D., in which

allegations were made that MOUSSEAU had embezzled and

misapplied tribal funds.

An accounting exam was made

of the paid checks, bank statements, checkbook stubs,

and other available records.

It was determined MOUSSEAU

as Director of Sun Dance, had received $8000 from the

tribe. After the event there was a balance remaining in

the account of $19.62. There were $689.14 in outstanding

checks and $1,035.23 in unpaid bills.

MOUSSEAU had

received $742 as reimbursement for his expenses, which

cannot be supported by documentary evidence.

MOUSS EAU

also purchased with Sun Dance funds tires for his personal

auto for $101.12 and linoleum for the floor in the house

he rents from

the tribe for $47.42. Tribal authority

was granted to JACK STEELE to run

I a rodeo in connection

with the Sun Dance. MOUSSEAU and RICHARD A. WILSON formed

a committee to run the rodeo, refused to allow STEELE to

participate, and used the rodeo stock of a second indivi-

dual, paying $1,114.74 to him, all without tribal authority.

MOUSSEAU

transferred $1600 of Sun Dance money to the

rodeo account without tribal authorization. The balance

in the rodeo account at date of examination was zero, with

12 checks unaccounted for. MOUSSEAU received $127 from

this account as reimbursement for expenses which cannot

be supported by documentary evidence.

Date.

LAWRENCE J. GLOVER (NA), Special Officer, Pine Ridge

Reservation, advised he had received a complaint from

THEODORE "RED" TIBBITTS, 5th member of the Executive Committee

of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, on October 2, 1969, in which TIBBITTS

stated his suspicions that there has been an embezzlement of

tribal funds.

The complaint states that subject ROBERT MOUSSEAU,

Indian male, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, appropriated tribal funds

Illegally to his own use, such funds having been entrusted to

him as director of the Sun Dance. GLOVER provided xerox copies

of the following documents:

An undated petition wherein certain members of the

Treaty Council requesting the Pine Ridge Superintendent to produce

minutes and records of expenditures of tribal funds for the

Sun Dance;

The letter dated September 30, 1969, from BRICE LAY,

Superintendent, to the Tribal Court, presenting the petition to

said Court;

A copy of the Tribal Court Order, ordering the books

and records of the Sun Dance to be produced.

In addition, GLOVER provided paid checks and bank

statements of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Sun Dance for the period

September 5, 1968, through September 5, 1969, and paid checks and

bank statements for the Oglala Sioux Stampede for the period

July 21, 1969, through September 1l, 1969.

These bank statements

and checks on

the above accounts were obtained by GLOVER from

THEODORE "RED" TIBBITTS

and WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, TIBBETTS and

LITTLE FINGER having stated they obtained same from Stockman's

National Bank, Rushville, Nebraska, where the accounts are

maintained.

GLOVER further stated both he and Superintendent BRICE

LAY are very desirous of obtaining a federal prosecution in this

matter should a case be developed because ROBERT MOUSSEAU is a

well-known troublemaker and thief and has caused many problems to

law enforcement on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

THEODORE "RED" TIBBITTS, Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

provided the following information:

He is the 5th member of the Executive Committee of the

Oglala Sioux Tribe, Pine Ridge Reservation.

ROBERT MOUSSEAU was

appointed Director

of the Sun

• Dance by the Tribal Council. The

Tribal Council had provided $5,000 operating expenses in its annual

budget to be used for the Sun Dance.

Approximately two - three

days prior to the staging of the Sun Dance, MOUSSEAU requested

an additional $3,000 from the Executive Board in order to pay

numerous outstanding bills.

This request was denied.

Several days later he requested an amount believed to

be $400 from WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Tribal Treasurer, so that the

gate men could make change. LITTLE FINGER gave this money to

MOUSSEAU.

A special meeting was held after the Sun Dance was

and the Tribal Committee approved the payment of an additional

05,000 FO MOUSSEAU for Sun Dance expenses.:

Because of the request

for additional money, the Executive Board became suspicious of

the handling of the funds. In addition, other members of the

Tribe were also suspicious and petitioned the Reservation

Superintendent for an audit.

A Tribal Court Order was then served upon the Executive

Board to produce the records.

MOUSSEAU agreed to provide the

records? but subsequently called the Tribal counsel (attorney)

in Washington, D. C., and was advised to plead immunity.

TIBBIIT'S stated he and WALLACE LITTLE FINGER then went

to the Stockman's National Bank in Rushville, Nebraska, and

obtained the checks and bank statements for the Sun Dance and

the Stampede and gave these to Special Officer LARRY GLOVER.

TIBBITTS stated ENOS POOR BEAR, Chairman of the Tribal

Council, will have the minutes of the meetings outlining their

authorizations. LITTLE FINGER will have records of expenditures.

TIBBITTS further related that this is the first

year the stampede or rodeo was to be held.

The Tribal Council

authorized JACK STEELE to run the rodeo and pay a percentage

of his profit to the tribe.

StEELE 1s a part-time rodeo

promoter with no connection to ROBERT MOUSSEAU.

Certain of the

rodeo equipment was obtained with a lease-purchase agreement

through

Dakota Leasing Equipment in Rapid City.

TIBBITTS further stated MOUSSEAU had obtained money

from Velma's Cafe, which was rented for August and september at

$75 per month, totaling $150. A receipt was issued.

This money

has never been received by the tribe.

MOUSSEAU stated he

placed the money in the Tribal Treasurer's Office at a time

when the safe was locked and there was no one present there.

ENOS POOR BEAR, President of the Tribal Council,

Oglala Sioux Tribe, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised that

the Council had appointed ROBERT J• MOUSSEAU Sun Dance

Director and PAUL, APPLE Assistant Direcior. These two

individuals are responsible to the Council for the operation

of the Sun Dance.

At the time the Sun Dance was run, "RED" TIBBITTS,

5th member of Council, WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Treasurer, and

LLOYD EAGLE BULL, all served on the Executive Committee. The

Council had appropriated the sum of $5,000 to run the Sun

Dance.

Prior to the operation of the event, MOUSSEAU requested

$300

in order to make change at the gate. He was given the

amount by WALLACE LITTLE FINGER.

There was a Special Session of Council called by

LLOYD EAGLE BULL, which later appropriated an additional $3,000

in Sun Dance funds. JACK STEELE was authorized to run the

Sious Stampede (rodeo). STEELE apparently had a falling-out

with RICHARD WILSON, who was apparently ramrodding the stampede.

When this occurred, JACK POURIER was brought in to provide the

rodeo stock.

There was no money appropriated by the Tribe to be

used for the stampede. Neither was there any authorization to

use Sun Dance money for the stampede.

POOR BEAR provided copies of the following documents:

Minutes of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Council, Regular

Session, April 8 - 29, and May 1 - 8, 1969;

WALLACE LITTLE FINGER,

Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

advised be is the treasurer of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

A subpoena duces tecum may be addressed to Mr. LITTLE FINGER

to obtain financial records of the tribe.

ROBERT MOUSSEAU and PAUL APPLE were appointed as

directors of the Oglala Sioux Sun Dance by the tribal

council and a budget of $5000 was allotted for operating

expenses. LITTLE FINGER stated that because of past

problems involved with the sun Dance, he did not wish

to participate in its operation and therefore he took

annual leave at that time.

He had written a check

drawn on the regular tribal funds in the amount of $5000

to enable the Sun Dance to start up.

Two days before

the Sun Dance was to have occurred,

MOUSSEAU appeared

before the tribal council and stated he was broke and

asked for an additional allocation of $3000. As this

amount was not in the budget, MOUSSEAU did not obtain the

money

at this time.

The tribal council at a later meeting

voted to revise the budget and granted MOUSSEAU the

additional $3000.

Also, just prior to the staging of

the Sun Dance, MOUSSEAU requested he be given $300 in

following the Sun Dance, this amount was deducted from

the $3000 later given to MOUSSEAU for the Sun Dance.

This $300 represents the only money the tribe had

received as

proceeds from the Sun Dance.

LITTLE FINGER further related according to the

administrative policy of the tribe, approval by the

council or the executive board must be obtained in order

for per diem to be received for travel off the reservation.

The per diem rate is usually $20 per day for long trips and

$7 to $12 for short trips, including Rapid City.

LITTLE FINGER

stated he does not know anything about the operation or

financing of the Oglala Sioux Stampede.

LITTLE FINGER provided copies of the following

obtained as of that date were

discussed at his request with

BRICE LAY, Superintendent, Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

Also present at this conference was Agency Special Officer

LAWRENCE GLOVER (NA) •

Both LAY and GLOVER expressed a strong desire for

federal prosecution in this case as ROBERT MOUSSEAU, RICHARD

Sioux Tribe of which MOUSSEAU, WILSON, and APPLE are officers

and/or council members.

It was felt by LAY and GLOVER that a conviction,

even of a misdemeanor with a suspended sentence, would go a

long way toward halting the thievery and stealing which runs

rampant on the reservation.

Finance Officer a certified statement of travel performed

by voucher form. This statement will be attached to the

This statement will be required even

though a cash advance

will be sufficient cause for appropriate action against

the traveler as deemed by the Executive Committee. The

Date

11/5/69

ROBERT J. MOUSSEAU, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, was

interviewed in the

in the presence of Police Lieutenant FRED TWO BULLS.

He was advised of the official identity of the interviewing

agent and was advised that the nature of the interview was

concerning the embezzlement of tribal funds. MOUSSEAU

was advised of his constitutional rights by presentation

of an Advice of Rights Form.

After reading this form,

he agreed to waive his rights and signed a Haiver of

Rights form. MOUSSEAU provided the following information:

He is secretary of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and

was Sun Dance director for the year 1969. The tribal

council had given JACK STEELE a contract to put on a

rodeo in conjunction with the annual Sun Dance.

The

agreement was the tribe was to get twenty-five percent

of the profit and

STEELE, seventy-five percent.

DICK WILSON and MOUSSEAU took it upon themselves

to handle the rodeo, as no committee had been appointed

by the tribe.

Several attempts have been made to contabt

STEELE to help plan the rodeo but he could not be reached.

A meeting was called for rodeo planning by WILSON which

MOUSSEAU could not attend. Afterwards,

WILSON told MOUSSEAU

that STEELE had backed out of the rodeo because he was not

getting enough money.

WILSON said JACK POURIER would take

the rodeo, so the committee gave it to him, feeling that

they could not get anyone else from the outside.

The arrangement with JACK POURIER waS a 50 - 50

split with the tribe.

There was no tribal approval for the

change in contract. MOUSSEAU continued stating the tribe

authorized the rodeo with no money. He told the tribal

council in special session he was going to use Sun Dance

money for the rodeo.

At this point MOUSSEAU was provided

with a copy of the minutes of the tribal council for the

pertinent periods, and he was unable to find any reference

to his having so notified the tribal council.

MOUSSEAU said he told the council he did not

want to run the Sun Dance and felt a committee should do so.

The council decided that the executive committee of the

tribe would be the Sun Dance committee.

The rodeo has lost money because entry fees

amounting to $60 to $80 were paid by checks which were not

good. MOUSSEAU expects the All American Indian Activities

Association to make good on these checks.

In regard to

the receipts by the Sun Dance and the Stampede, MOUSSEAU

stated tickets were sold at the rodeo but were not accounted

Admission was gained to the Sun Dance by stamping

hands of people as they paid. He could not see anything

wrong with this system, as it has always been like this.

In regard to the transfer of funds from the Sun Dance to

the rodeo, MOUSSEAU stated he assumed that since both

activities were tribal sponsored, the money could be

interchanged.

WALLACE LITTLE FINGER, Tribal Treasurer, gave

him, MOUSSEAU, the checkbook for the Sun Dance and

stated he did not want anything to do with it.

As to the booster trip made to Rapid City,

MOUSSEAU said he took eight to ten people from Pine

Ridge

and got several more Indians who lived in Rapid City to

participate.

JACK FASH (phonetic) promoted and suggested

the idea.

Transportation to Rapid City was provided by

tribal station wagon and two Government cars (General Services

Administration).

NILES BOLLINGER, Superintendent of

schools, approved the use of these vehicles.

The group

traveled to Rapid City. Upon arrival there,

MOUSSEA U

paid for the lunch in the amount of approximately $30.00

Following the meal, these people went to the Greyhound

Race Track where they put on several dances in the middle

of the field.

MOUSSEAU stated the sun Dance lost money

because of the rodeo. He stated the filming of the Sun

Dance and the rodeo by CASEY TIBBS and JOEL MC RAY was set

up by LLOYD EAGLE BULL and himself.

The only payment they

got was one buffalo:

MOUSSEAU feels the tribe should have

been paid much more than this.

'MOUSSEAU is not aware of any policy on per diem

or tribal authorization needed to obtain per diem payments

while on a trip.

MOUSSEAU was shown a copy of the administrative

procedure of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and it was pointed out

where such policy exists, authorization is required.

MOUSSEAU then stated the

policy was not followed by

anyone.

When inquiries were made as to the work provided for the

Sun Dance by PAUL APPLE, MOUSSEAU stated APPLE was a

foremen and worked on just about everything in regard to

the Sun Dance, even appearing on television.

He was also

in charge of prisoner labor.

When questioned about the

payments to himself of per diem, MOUSSEAU stated these

were for trips which he had made all through the Black

Hills and to the Rosebud Reservation where he was advertising

the Sun Dance, putting up posters, looking for ideas, etc.

to provide any information or documentation

as to the dates of these trips, the times involved, or

exactly what each trip was for. He was unable to relate

checks to specific dates.

When questioned as to the

$250 check received by him for "operating expenses and

advertising", MOUSSEAU was unable to provide any concrete

information

in support of this item.

He stated that he

paid people to advertise the Sun Dance and to talk it up

at Pow Hows; these were Toka Indians who were paid amounts

of $5, $10,

or $15 depending on how big the pow How was.

MOUSSEAU gave these people cash and did not obtain receipts.

He was unable to name any of the people who obtained this

money. He further stated this check was to cover use of

his car for advertising, which was not included in the

per diem payments.

When questioned about the amount of

$85 noted as being for "technical assistance", MOUSSEAU

his pay for running the sun Dance. At this point MOUSSEAU

stated it is his belief the Executive Committee of the tribe

took action two or three weels before the Sun Dance in

which the Sun Dance Committee would "pay for everything".

In regard to the four tires purchased from

Pine Ridge Husky Service Station, MOUSSEAU admitted these

tires were placed on his car.

He said it was his understanding

that they would be on his regular bill.

_ However, MOUSSEAU

did admit that he reviewed the charge slips submitted by

Husky Service Station to the Sun Donce and had seen the

charges for the tires. However, he paid the bill from the

Sun Dance fund anyway.

NEMITZ stated ROBERT MOSSEAU had come into his

station and stated he needed tires on his personal car and

since he was chairman

of the Sun Dance, it was all right

to put these tires on his personal car and charge them to

the Sun Dance.

This total bill was paid by check number 861,

payable to Husky Service Station. This check was cashed

by NEMITz at the sioux Nation Shopping Center where it

RICHARD A. VILSON, Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

was interviewed in the Pine Ridge Reservation Police

Station in the presence oi POliCe Lieutenant FRED TWO BULLS.

He was advised of the official identity of the interviewing

agent and was advised that the nature of the interview was

concerning the embezzlement of tribal funds. WILSON

was advised oi his constitutional rights by presentation

of an Advice of Rights form.

Aiter reading this form

le agreed to waive his rights and signed a Waiver of

Rights form. WILSON provided the following information:

•A man

The tribal council took action to permit JACK STEELE

to put on a rodeo in conjunction with the annual fun Dance.

He was to provide and install equipment etc. The tribe

was to get twenty-five percent of the profits and STEELE,

seventy-five percent.

After this had been agreed to,

the tribe included advertisements for the rodeo or' stampede

on the posters and advertisements for the sun Dance.

STEELE had located the needed equipment in

Sioux Falls.

The tribe bought this equipment on a lease

arrangement

as StEELE was not able to come up with the

money to purchase it on his own.

The equipment came

from Dakota Leasing, who also gave the Oglala sioux Tribe

$600 which was added to the amount of lease to bring the

entire agreement up to $2500.

The committee needed the

additional $600 for fences and other expenses.

Since the tribe bought the equipment, the

committee

felt the deal should be the tribe receiving

seventy-five percent and STEELE twenty-five percent.

STEELE had apparently made an additional deal for use

of very expensive bulls at the rodeo and wanted more

money to handle this increased cost.

About thirteen days before the show was to be

put on a meeting was held. STEELE could not be pinned

down by the members of the committee regarding the contract.

The committee then agreed with JACK POURIER that he would

provide the stock for the rodeo and split 50 - 50 with the

tribe for expenses. At this meeting the committee elected afficers.

information:

As a sideline he is in the business of promoting

rodeos and providing stock for use in rodeos. He had obtained

approval from the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council to run a rodeo

in connection with the annual Sun Dance to be held in 1969.

STEELE stated he has a partner who usually works with him ir

these events who is CHARLIE KRAMER of Chadron, Nebraska.

Approximately a week or a little longer before the

Sun Dance, STEELE

and KRAMER attended a meeting for the purpose

of getting the rodeo organized. This meeting may have occurred

approximately at the end of July. Present at this meeting were

DICK WILSON, JACK POURIER, DAVE POURIER, LLOYD TWISS, and

"JUNIOR" TWISS. BOB MOUSSEAU was not present.

STEELE and KRAMER did not like the deal which was

offered to them by the committee. They wanted 75 per cent of

the proceeds with 25 per cent going to the Tribe. For the 75

per cent, stunts was to provide the stock, get cowboys, handle

his usual fee.

In this case, however, the tribe was going to provide

the advertising and prisoner labor. A deal was offered to

STEELE and KRAMER for 50 per cent.

They did not like this cut

and left the meeting to talk the matter over.

They went to a

bar in White Clay, Nebraska, in order to discuss the matter and to

have lunch.

While they were in the bar, DICK WILSON arrived and

told STEELE it was all over and they were out - that someone

else would handle the rodeo.

STEELE understands the matter was settled for a

50-50 split with JACK POURIER.

him was dismissed

Dear Mi. Clayion:

I have every season to believe that the handling of majos crimes on

the Pine Ridge Reservation by your office inciuding the proper investig-

ative, case building procedure, and prosecution has bean far irom adequate.

I am particulariy concerned because of my personal experience with the

hit and run death of my father and your failure to get a conviction oi the

man responsible and now the theii of his cattie. You may recall in a

special session of the United Siour Tribes at Pine Ridge, Souün Darova inst

spring at which you were present

I specifically cailed on you to accept and

prosecute complaints of Indian catüiemen.

Let me describe to you facts regarding the handling of

theft of calves

from my father's estate, which in my estimation is a disgrace to the noie

Federal

systen of law.

Three calves were stolen from my father's estate on or about

other calves were slici, i.a. no brands.

The brand inspecior neid up the check of the branded caii. Ine

others were solà and checx received.

Three weeks after the theit, I finally receivea a call iron

my wife (from Mandeison; South Dakota - I was in Denver,

Colorado) - her message - the F.B.I. investigator is here and

The investigatos asteà ii I molid

testify in the event of a trial. (I paid jor the phone call;

These are the facts. Now I would like to submit to you my opinion.

A.

Investigative procedure:

1.

Because the theit of Indian cattle by white-men on the

reservation is a common occurance, and because prosecutior

has such a poor record of convictions - I susgest a

special program to train leueral law enforcement. Officers

or that matier, I suggesü training in every area o:

investigation.

2. I further suggest that BIA law Inforeement officers be

removed from line authority of Agency, and Aras Offices an:

that they function only ouù of a central office independent

of polivical control.

3.

I further suggest that the BiA and F.3.I. establish some

kind of cooperative procedure to deal wiüh major crimes

against Indians.

. B.

Prosecution:

1. I suggest the U. S. Attorney's offica request irom the

Federal. Governmeni an adequate buâgei to effect a reasorable

approach to prosecution.

2.

I sussest that jurors in federal court be Indians iron tra

reservations vere the crimo is commitiea.

c.

Finally and above all

I would suggest scraping tre whole sysüe...

with action by congress to set up a vajor Indian Crimes Jusüice

system using Tribei

judges and courts incilding the prosecution of

wnite-men on Indian reservations by Indian courts.

Wiün govers

by trioal courts do convict non-indians to federal prisors.

In summary, I do hope you fuifill your connission as ü. S. Attorney in tois

matter of prosecuting the theives who are a menace o Indian socieus.

Dear Sir:

Regarding the theit of your cattle by a white

man on a "closed'

portion of the Pine riage Reservation,

It is clear that

the

U.S. Attorney has jurisdiction to

prosecute the thier.

Section 1152 of Title 18 of the

U.S. Code provides

that the general laws of the United

States as

. to the punishment of offenses committed within

the exclusive jurisdiction of the united States shall

extend to Indian country.

provides that the laus of the suates are incorporated into

federal law

for areas wiinin federa jurisdiction.

fore, the Souin Dakota laus with respect to larceny anc

burglary are applicable to Indian country and are to be

federal prosecutor. There is no doiot

that section 1152 applies to crimes committea by non-

Indians against indians in Indian country.

See, e.g.,

Acunia v. Unitea States, 404 f. Là 140, 141 (9tn Cir. 1968).

It is aiso clear that the State prosecutor has

no jurisdiciion over

crimes ecanitted by non-Indians

against Indians on the

"ciosed" portion of the Pine Ridge

Reservation.

Souin Dakota Supreme Court has held hat

such areas are

wiühin the exclusive jurisdiction and autho-

rity

of the United States. In se fligh Pine, 78 S.D. 121,

99 N.W. 2à 38 (1959):

Thus, in the U.S. Attorney racis to pacsecute the

thiei, it amounis to no less than a shirking of his cuty.

Keep an eye on his conduct during üne case, and iet us know

if you are dissatisfied with

his prosacution of the matter.

William Clayton

and SWIFT BIRD then went home.

YOUNG continued that he, JONES and JACK then arove the police

car to

his iouse and started to go in for a cup of coffee when he

saw a car turning at the stop sign on Main Street going east.

He saw someone in the car throw a beer can in the street as they

turned the corner so he, JONES and JACK got back in the police

car and started after them.

He saw the car parked in front of

the Lone Dog Cafe in Pine Riage; however, when they got up with

them, the WILSON car took off on United States Highway 18 going

east. They chased the

subjects car; however, the police car was

not functioning properly so they gave up the

chase, turned around

and started back to Pine Ridge to get DENNIS LE COMPTE and his

automobile.

The WILSON car also turned around and followed to

the parking area in the rear of LE CoMPty's house.

When the

WILSON car came up behind them, he and JONES walked back to the

WILSON car and he asked DICK WILSON, who was driving, what he was

pulling off as

he was putting himself and YOUNG on the spot. DICK

WILSON ala not answer and YOUNG started back to the police car.

He then heard DICK WILSON tell JONES to get the light out of his

Lace but could not hear any more of the conversation. JONES

came back to the police ca and YOUNG told JONES and JACk to go

get LE COMPTE and SWIFT BIRD.

The WILSoN car then backed up

and someone said, "Go get DENNIS LE COMPTE and the rest of your

cops".

The WILSON car then left. .

YOUNG continued that JONES and JACK returned to the car with JOE

SWIFT BIRD and the four of them then drove to the police station

and parked the car. JACK then lifted the hood and started

messing with the motor and SWIFT BIRD went inside to make a phone

call. The WILSON car stopped on the highway in front of the

police station and were cursing JONES in loud voices.

He and

JONES started to get out of the car and the WILSON automobile then

left again.

A few minutes later, DENNIS LE COMPTE drove up in his

Government

automobile and

a few seconds later the WILSON car again passed

the station going north. DENNIS, SWIFT BIRD and JONES chased

them in LE COMPTE's car and he drove the police car around town.

south toward White Clay, Nebraska. Inasmuch as the police

WILSON car and saw two or three beer cans being thrown from the

WILSON car.

They caught up with the WILSoN car just prior to

reaching the Nebraska State Line; however, DICK WILSON weaved his

car back and forth preventing the police car from coming abreast

with

them.

LE COKPTE turned on the siren and the WILSON car then

stopped and all of the occupants of the WILSON car got out, as

aid the police officers. LEROY JANIS started after DENNIS

L.d

COMPTE and DONALD JANIS and ROBERT WHALEN came after him. They

were backing him up so he pulled his revolver and held them off.

DICK WILSON's wife came up and said it was going to cause a lot

of trouble, so JONES put his revolver away. When his revolver

was in the

holster, either WhALEN of DONALD JANIS hit him in the

jaw almost knocking him to the ground. He again pulled his

revolver and by then DICK WILSON

joined DONALD JANIS and WHALEN.

LICK WILSON grabbed the cross strap of his sambrowne belt and

told him to unload his revolver.

He said that he would not un-

load it so DICK WILSON drew back to hit him

and he then pushed

DICK WILSON away and shot him twice with .38 caliber tear gas

DICK WILSON went down and LEROY JANIS rushed up and hit

YOUNG with his fist.

YOUNG then was surrounded by LEROY JANIS,

DONALD JANIS and ROBERT WHALEN and he was trying to hold them off

with his revolver and asked LE COMPTE if he should shoot one of

He told them that there were no more gas shells in his

gun and that the rest were lead bullets so they then backed down.

YOUNG continued that things then quieted down and the subjects

got back in their car and he, SWIFT BIRD and JONES got in

police car, drove about a block down the highway, turned around

and then parked directly across the road from the WiLSON car.

He stated that just about then GEORGE WILSON drove up, walked to

the JIM WILSON car and the next thing that he saw, GEORGE WILSON

was at the window of the police car.

GEORGE WILSON then s truck

at JONEs through the window, breaking the window of the Goverment

automobile. JINES then said something to the effect of let's get

them, so JONES opened the door and got out.

As YOUNG opened the

other front door, DONALD and LEROY JANIS grabbed him and ROBERT

WHALEN got him from the driver's side. LEROY grabbed YoUNG's

revolver from his hand and ROBERT and

DONALD JANIS held him and

hit him several times. He stated that he must have passed out

as the next thing he knew, he was across the ditch and lying next

to the fence row; everyone was gone, so he walked back to Pine

YoUng stated that he definitely was not drinking any alcoholic

beverage nor were any of the other police officers.

He stated

he does not know whether the subjects were intoxicated nor does

he have any proof they were drinking. The only thing in this

regard was

the fact that he saw the empty beer cans being thrown

from the WILSON car when they were chasing it from Pine Ridge to

white Clay, Nebraska.

Interview with Eye Witness

Mr. GORDON JAMES JONES, a volunteer Deputy Tribal Policeman, was

interviewed by the writer in the presence of Special Officer

DENNIS LE COMPTE on October 21, 1954, and fumished the following

information concerning his

recollection of the events happening

on October 16, 1954:

JONES stated thet he came on duty at approximately 6:00 pom. on

October 15, 1954, and was cruising in the police car with SIDNEY

YOUNG and LEONARD JACK.

At approximately 8:00 p.m., he saw JIM

WILSON's car parked near the One Dog Cafe on Main Stret of Pine

Ridge, wouth Dakota.

JONES stated that he did not notice anyone

in the car at that time. At 8:45 p.m., Mrs. MOLLIE SITTING HOLY

came to tne police station and

that she had been knifed by

her husband. He, YOUNG and JACK took Mrs. SITTING HOLY to the

Pine Ridge Indian Hospital and YOUNG then called JOSEPH SWIFT

BIRD to come to the hospital to investigate the matter.

A short

while later, SWIFT BIRD came to the hospital and talked to Mrs.

SITTING HOLY, the nurse on duty on Ir. RUBY. He and SWIFT BIRD

then drove back to Pine Ridge in SWIFT BIRD's car and YOUNG and

JACK came to Pine Ridge in the police car. Mrs. TYON then came

to the station and said that she had seen GEORGE SITTING HOLY

going toward White Clay, Nebraska. The four got in the police

car and drove to white Clay looking for SITTING HOLY; however,

they did not find him so they drove

to the White Clay rodeo

grounds and saw a car parked there. He thought, at that time,

it was JI! WILSON's car but was not sure.

They

then went through

Pine Ride and back to where GEORGS SITTING HOLY was living, which

was about six miles northwest of Pine Ridge. They arrested

• GEORGE

SITTING HOLY and brought him to the police station and then booked

him. SWIIT BIRD went home shortly thereafter and he, YOUNG and

JACK started patroling the town again. They stopped at YOUNG's

house and were almost in the house when he heard a car speeding

so they then got back in the car.

They caught up with this car

in front of the Lone Dog Cale where it had stopped; however, it

-13-

pulled out when they got there and headed east on Highway 18.

They got up even with the car but could not pass it so YUNG

turned the police car around and they started back for Pine Ridge.

The other car went about 100 yards,

stopped and also turned around.

They then arove to DENNIS Li, COMPTr's house to get another car

to help them and the subjects followed and pulled up behind

Li COMPTE'S house also. He and YOING walked back to the subjects'

car and he shined a light in the car and YOUNG said something to

the subjects to the effect that they ought to know better than

that and they replied with a question as to why the cops were

following them.

He and YOUNG then walked back to the police car

and the subjects cursed them and were using loud and obscene

language. YOUNG told him to get DENNIS LI COMPTE and SWIFT BIRD

to help them. He and JACK started after DENNIS and SWIFT BIRD and

subjects were honking the horn and racing their motor.

JONEs continued that they got SWIFT BIRD and when they returned

to the car, the subjects were gone.

SWIFT BIRD got in the car

with them

and drove back to the police station and tried to fina

out what was wrong with the police car, which was not operating

correctly. SWIFT BIRD went inside the

police station to make

telephone

call and he and YOUNG stayed in the car.

The subjects

drove by, stopped in the middle of the road and again cursed he

and YOUNG and as he and YOUNG got out of the car, the subjects

drove south on highway 18.

SWIFT BIRD then came out of the

police station and DENNIS LE COMPTE drove up.

They saw

come north through

the stop sign with no lights and recognized

it as the subjects' car.

When it passed the station, he, LE

COMPTE and SWIFT BIRD got in the police car and tried to catch

them.

They followed for about five miles and when they could not

catch them, turned around and started toward fine Ridge.

JONES then saw a car following so LE COMPTE pulled off the road

and waited until the car passed to be sure it was the subjects.

When it was determined that it was the WILSON car, they started

after them again and when they arrived at the stop sign, YOUNG

was there, so he got in the car with them.

They drove for

approximately one-quarter of a mile and saw the subjects parked

with their lights off; however, they started up again when they

saw the police car coming. He

continued that they caught up

with the subjects just at the State line and turned the siren on

so the subjects stopped. All the parties got out of both cars

and ROBERT WHALEN and Mrs. DICK WILSON came Up to JONES, who had

a blackjack in his hand.

Both said something to the effect that

- 14-

## Page 221

MP 89-38

he was not to do anything and there would not be any trouble. At

that time, DENNIS LE COMPTs was talking to LEROY JANIS. There

was talking for a short tine and then he heard two shots, turned

and ran in that direction and saw DICK WILSON fall in a ditch

about 15 yards in front of LE COMPlE's car. He then saw DONALD

JANIS and ROBERT WHALEN remove their shirts and they were trying

to get at Officer YOUNG. JONES and SWIFT BIRD tried to get between

them and WHALEN finally said that they would quit if YCUNG would

out away his gun, which YOUNG did. JONES stated that he is not

positive but believes that one of them then hit YOUNG as YOUNG

pulled his gun again and asked LE COMPTE if he should shoot.

YOUNG finally put his revolver away and came to the car along with

SWIFT BIRD and they locked the doors and rolled up the windows.

JONES continued that at this point everything was calm and no

one was fighting so JONES drove LE COMPTE's car down the road,

turned it arouna and

parked it directly across the highway from

the subjects' car. He, SWIFT BIRD and YOUNG were sitting there

when GEORGE WILSON drove up.

DENNIS had all of the subjects in

their car, except Mrs. WILSON, when GEORGI WILSON drove up.

GEORGE

WILSON then went to the subjects' car and shortly thereafter,

CEORGE WILSON and the other subjects started for LE COMPIE'S

car.

GEORGE WILSON came to the driver's side of the police car and

swung his fist, breaking the window on the driver's side, his

entire arm going through the window. JONES stated that he then

opened the door, jumped out and started wrestling with GEORGE

WILSON. When WILSON started using his fists, he then hit WILSON

and knocked him down.

He also fell down and one of the subjects

then jumped on him and started hitting him with his fists.

DENNIS LE COMPTE then pulled this man off of him and started for

LE COMPTE's car, where he could see fists flying at YOUNG. As he

reached the rear of the car, LEROY JANIS came for him and

next thing he knew, he was

on the ground

and LEROY JANIS had his

knee in his stomache and JANIS swung again with a revolver, which

he had in his hand, hitting JONES again in the head. LEROY JANIS

had the gun pointed out at his head and he started

rolling to get

away from him. Someone then pulled JANIS off of him and JONES

then started north down the highway

toward White Clay, Nebraska,

for hlep. He met SWIFT BIRD later at Kelly Coon's house, where

they tried to get help; however, no one would answer their door.

He and SWIFT BIRD started walking to Pine Ridge and he, JONES,

passed out in a field.

When he came to,

no one was around so

he walked to Pine Riage and to LE COMPTE's house. LE COYFTE wes

home and SWIFT BIRD and YOUNG came in a little later and all four

went to the Hospitsl, where YOUNG and he received treatment.

JONES stated that he definitely had no alcoholic beverage that

intire day and to his knowledge, neither did SIDNEY YOUNG or

JOSEPH SWIFT BIRD OF DENNIS LE COMPTE.

Interviews with Subjects

It is noted that prior to interviewing the subjects, each was

advised of the seriousness of the allegation made against him and

the fact that any information furnished by him would be used in

court against him. Each was advised that he was under no complusion

to answer questions and that if he did, it was to be on a volun-

tary basis.

Mr. LEROY JOSEPH JANIS was interviewed by the writer on October

20, 1954, at the residence of DENNIS LE COMPTE and in his presence.

that on Saturday, October 16, 1954, he was in Martin, South

Dakota, and was drinking whiskey at the M and M Bar.

Late in

the afternoon, he drove his car to Pine Ridge and fixed two flats

at Al's Texaco Service in Pine Ridge. He parked his car at his

sister's house and woke up his brother, DONALD JANIS.

DONALD then got in a car with ORLIN W. WILSON, his wife and

MERLE ROBERT WHALEN.

They drove out into the

country and one of

the boys played a guitar and the rest sang songs.

cannot recall whether he was drinking anything at that time. He

believes that they went to someone's house to get dressed for a

dance. It was his opinion that they went to the home of JIM

WILSON SO ORLIN's wife could change her clothes.

He does not

recall stopping and talking to any police officers on their way

through town. On the way back through Pine Ridge, he does recall

stopping at the stop sign and then proceeding south on the highway

toward White Clay, Nebraska, where the dance was to be held.

He believes they

stopped the

car before reaching the State line

and the four men relieved themselves along the highway. Just

as they crossed the state line into Nebraska, he heard a siren

and someone said, "It's the cops, stop the carl

, so they stopped.

LEROY JANIS stated he does not remember what started the fight

but he does recall participating in it. He stated that he also

remembers getting SIDNEY YOUNG's revolver out of the police car;

however, he does not recall hitting anyone with it. LEROY JANIS

stated he cannot recall the details of the fight inasmuch as he

was intoxicated at that time.

directly across the road was my fathers car pointing

south.

I walked on the road between the two cars and

heard my brother Dick yell that he had been shot. 1

the window was down but knew it wasn't when the win-

Vro DICK WHALEN, father of subject WHALEN, contacted the writer

to the caotioned matter.

He stated

that he had no first-hand knowledge what transpired on the evening

of October 16, 1954; however, he had heard that the officers

involved had been drinking.

When requested to be specific in

his allegations, he stated

that the waitress who works in his

cafe, Mrs. LOUISE SKINNER, had told him that she had passed by

scene of the alleged assault and JOSEPH SWIFT BIRD and appeared

intoxicated when he talked with her: Mr. WHALEN

Mrs. SKINNER was the only person he had heard make such a remark.

Mrs. LOUISE SKINNER was interviewed by the writer on the evening

whose name she

would prefer not

to divulge, were driving north

on Nebraska State Mighway 87 at approximately midnight on October

16, 1954, and had been stopped at the scene of the alleged

assault by Officer JOSEPH SWIFI BIRD. He asked Mrs. SKINNER

and her companion to telephone

the Sheriff at Rushville, Nebraska,

and ask him to come to the scene of the fight. When

asked what

the

trouble was, SWIFT BIRD and

said something about DICK WILSON

having run into

some officers.

According to Mrs. SKINNER, the

statement made no senge

and she had assumed that SWIFT BIRD was

intoricated. She stated she had smelled no alcohol on SWIFT

BIRD's breath and was completely unfamiliar with SWIFT BIRD's

manner of

speech when sober, intoxicated or excited.

and beaded toward the car.

"About that time GARY THOMAS backed out and

Te were going to report the incident to the police

but THOMAS suggested to get someone to accompany

we to avoid any mistreatment by the BIA.

"I KNOW RICHARD WILSON bad a "goon squad."

He hired approximately 50 people, through funds

received from the area office of Aberdoen, for

security of BIA and Tribal buildings. Approxi-

mately $60,000 was secured for this purpose.

These

people were issued "Billy" clubs, guns, mace, given

18 hours of riot training and turned loose on the

people of Pine Ridge. I am positive that the "goor

squad" members were seen drinking on the job in

BIA and Tribal offices. After the FELLOW THUNDER

conplaints.

For awhile I set up an ex offius office

at the legal Aid Services office. I not only re-

colved complaints in Pine Ridge

but also fron area

of Scente, landerson, founded knee, and Porcupine.

The complaints dealt with terrorism, harassment,

particularly fron the young and even some old

people were treated disrespectfully. The complaints

vere numerous and I tired all avenues even to talk

ing to WILSON and the Ass't. U. B. Attorney in Rapid

city to resolve them but all doors ware closed.

"I also received threats personally against

my life and my braids.

once threatened me with police action just after I

received a restraining order forbidding me to at-

tempt any meetings. He said he would lock me up

and make sure I stayed locked up. He said he was

not going to tolerate disobedience of his or tribal

laws and mould stop any trouble before it started.

ment as it is now constituted is true.

During the reading of the statement when MEANS

reached the part concerning threats against himself on page

three, he laughed out loud and stated, "I regret I have only

one set of braids to give to my country."

It is noted that only one witness was present due

to the unavailability of other Special Agent personnel.

Dato

JOSEPH FRANCIS MERRIVAL was contacted at his residence,

993 Douglas Drive,

and advised of the identity of the inter-

viewing agents and that investigation was being conducted

regarding an attack on RUSSELL MEANS and GARY THOMAS in the

Sioux Nation Shopping Center on February 27, 1973.

He was

advised of his rights by Special Agent CARPER as set forth on

a form captioned "Interrogation; Advice of Rights", which ha

read, stated he understood, and signed.

He advised that on the day in question, he and his wife,

GERTRUDE, were visiting at EARL DEON's house, and also present

were GLEN THREE STARS, ELMER WINTERS, PETE MERRIVAL, and DEON.

He and his wife advised they were leaving the rasidence to go

to the Sioux Nation Shopping Center, at which time the other

four individuals stated they were going there as they had just

received word that some "outsiders" were at the Center.

MERRIVAL stated "outsiders" is the term used by Indians

residing in the Pine Ridge, South Dakota, area for other

Indians and non-Indians who have been coming into the area of

the reservation and causing problems such as occuried at Custer

the first of the year.

He and his wife drove in their automobile to the sioux

Nation store and went inside for approximately five to ten

minutes, and when they came out they observed DEON, WINTERS,

THREE STARS, and PETE MERRIVAL talking to two individuals in

car in the shopping center.

The car backed up from the parking

place, at which time DEON was yelling something to the occupants

of the car to the effect that "If you want to start trouble,

why don't you start with me." The dar then drove from the

shopping center,

and he and his wife left, and he believed the

other four individuals got into a car and also left.

He was later charged with assaulting MEANS, as was THREE

STARS, and they appeared in court where the charges were dis-

missed due to lack of evidence.

After their court appearance, he heard WINTERS and DEON

laughing about the fact he and THREE STARS had been charged

with hitting MEANS when they had nothing to do with the fact

MEANS was apparently hit once or twice.

He has talked to

WINTERS and WINTERS has in a bragging way informed him that

was the one who hit MEANS.

During this period of time in late february, 1973, most

of the Indians living in the Pine Ridge area were extremely

coming into

their area and causing trouble.

STARS, WINTERS, DEON, and PETE

MERRIVAL had approached these

two individuals, and he feels the whole nature of their contact

was strictly to tell the outsiders to. leave town.

MERRIVAL stated he did not desire: to furnish a signed

statement regarding the above as he is presently free on bail

in connection with an assault on a police officer in Pine Ridge.

He stated the reason he. left Pine Ridge was because he felt if

he remained he would have to

take sides either with the out-

siders on with the local Indians,

and he simply did not want

to make this decision.

He stated if necessary he would testify

to the above information in Federal court..

of the car and slowly walk over to our place where we were

standing. I greeted WILSON and so dia GARY THOMAS.

As WILSON approached us, he slowly took off his

sunglasses and said to THOMAS, 'Do you want a piece of

me, you son-of-a-bitch.' THOMAS said that he did not

want any trouble with WILSON. WILSON then came forward,

again repeated his phrase and started raising his voice.

There were several newspaper and media people in the

vicinity and they gathered around. RICHARD MULLER Of

KELO TV, Sioux Falls was there as was some man from

the Associated Press outside South Dakota_ as well as one

of the Denver, COlorado television station news bureaus.

WILSON told THOMAS that he, THOMAS, had until 8:30 A.M.

the following morning to get off the Pine Ridge

Reservation or he would turn his goons loose on THOMAS.

I interrupted WILSON and tried to make small talk,

because all of the media people were starting to let

the cameras roll, etc.

WILSON said to THOMAS, 'You

son-of-a-bitch, you swore at me yesterday, and now

I am promising you that if you are not off of this

reservation by 8:00 A.M. tomorrow my goons will

kill you. This is not a threat, it is a promise.'

"WII.SON further remarked that THOMAS and the

other attorney, the 'Mexican, chile bean bastard,

Mario Gonzelas - had caused enough trouble on the

Pine Ridge.

"About this point in time, Mrs. WILSON came forward

and started to push THOMAS around telling him that he

had threatened her husband, and that she would take care

. of THOMAS if her husband didn't. By this time a large

crowd had gathered and was watching the incident. A

couple of cars stopped, and WILSON said that these were

a couple of his 'boys'. One of them came forward and

started to push THOMAS around. I interceded and told

him to get back and stay out of it. I then grabbed

WILSON by the arm and pulled him to the back of the

car to talk to him, and I send THOMAS back across the street

to THOMAS's car.

THOMAS went across the street and got

into his car, and I proceeded to stand with WILSON for

approximately 15 minutes and visit with him.

"The above statement is true and correct to the best

of my knowledge, and it is given to Mr. MOGEN of theFBI

GROSSENBURG said the term "

was mentioned several times but he does not recalf the

context and does not recall that WILsoN said that nis

"goons" would kill anyone.

GROSSENBURG believes that

the subject of goons was brought up either by JANKLOW or

or possibly by hinself, inasmuch as ail were

engaged In a heated argument and that Mrs. WILSON also

joined in the discussion, using profanity and making

wild statements, the exact nature of which GROSSENBURG

cannot recall.

GROSSENBURG further stated that he did not

feel any danger himself from WILSON or feel that THOMAS

seriously considered himselt in any danger, but it was

a heated argument and yelling contest with high tempers

on both sides, and as a result, he does not remember any

exact statements made by anyone in the argument.

He recalled that JANKLOW quieted WILSON down

and eventually he,

THOMAS, and JaNKloW drove away, without

any further altercation with the WILSONs.

My home is in Rushville. I sas going to

my office in Pine Ridge and consented to give them

a ride. At approximately 2:30 Polle we stopped at

the Sioux Nation store in Pine Ridge.

RUSSELI. MEANS

entered the store to buy a paper. He returned

approximately five minutes later. A woman named

ROSE BULL BEAR from Kyle came up to the car and

conversed with MEANS. During the conversation an

Indian male came up to the car wearing a cowboy hat.

He approached the driver's side and looked in. I

asked if I could help him. The man shook his head

and went back into the store. ROSE continued talking

tO MEANS. Within a couple of minutes approximately

five males came out of the store. The man in the

cowboy hat came with them. One or two men came up

to the driver's side, the others to MEANS' side. I

locked the door, rolled up the window, and started

the engine in order to back away. Simultaneously,

the men on MEANS* side shoved ROSE away and directed

a couple of blows at MEANS. Some of the men asked,

"MEANS, are you causing trouble in the Sioux Nation Store?"

MEANS sustained a lip injury which was bleeding. I

aid not observe any other injuries.

"I do not know if MEANS had trouble in the store.

He said he had a conversation with an elderly person

but seemed surprised when the men attacked.

"Afterward, we proceeded to Calico Village. I

Let MEANS and the CONROY girl out of my vehicle at

approximately 3 poll. MEANS did not indicate his

destination. He had not mentioned Wounded Knee at

all prior to this time. I was not aware of any planned

trouble there and did not learn of the take over until

7=30 or 8 p.ml. that same day.

"After letting MEANS and COUROY out of the

car I went to Pine ridge to the BIA building to

seek a U. S. Marshal or an FBI agent to raport the

incident.

My purpose was to advise them because I

thought MEANS might get angry and return with a mob.

MEANS did not indicate he was angry but rather said

he would sign a complaint. He told me of the

identities of two men involved in the attack. I

did not know any of them. The two he hamed were

JOE MERRIVAT and GLENN THREE STARS. MEANS said they

were friends of DICK WILSON's. At the BIA building

I spoke to an unknown person on the U. S. Marshal's

staff. He suggested I sign a complaint against the

men.

I discussed the matter with "SKI" JACOBS,

Captain of police and afterward did sign a complaint

against MERRIVAL and THREE STARS. I do not know if

MEANS ever did.

"For several months I had heard rumors at Fine

Ridge concerning a "goon squad" supposedly hired by

DICK WILSON. The rumors also stated that these

people were paid with approximataly $65,000 obtained

through the area office.

"In February, 1973, during the attempted impeach-

ment of WILSON there were several U. S. Marshal's at

Pine Ridge. I spoke to REIS R. KASH Of the Marshal's

service who stated in effect that he was surprised and

displeased to learn that there was a "goon squad" on

the reservation. He ordered thai no. more federal

monies be paid to these men and dismantled the group

because their existence contributed to the anxiety oi

the situation. This is the first word from an official

tise

source I geceived concerning the existence of a

"goon squad." I had heard runors but do not know

of specific instances where people were intimidated.

Everything was hearsay. I never checked out the

stories personally. For example, rumor had it that

ELLEN MOOSE CAMP, Trailer Court, Pine Ridge, had her

trailer entered and ransacked by the "goon squad."

LILLIAN RICHARDS, Secretary, Tribal Office, allegedly

was beaten by "goon squad"

and required hospitilization.

A house belonging to YELLOW BOY was supposedly burned

in North Ridge by the "goon squad!" because he housed

out of state people in his home. FRANK FOOLS CROW's

house was allegedly entered and he and his family

threatened by the "goon squad." I heard also that

some of the men were funded by Manpower.

"I have no other information except on February

28, 1973, I picked up an attorney, BILL JANKLOW from

Pierre at the airport. We were accompanied by another

attorney, MICK GROSENBERG, States Attorney, Winner.

BILL was looking for his client's mother, Mrs. BLACK

FEATHER. I drove them around town. While standing

in front of the Pine Ridge courthouse, DICK WILSON

approached me.

He said "If you're here past 8:30

in the morning I'll have you killed." The other

attorneys heard the threate. I spoke to WILSON many

times while working at Legal Aid Services. Our office

had some conflict with WILSON. We tried to tell him

we were not involved in partisan politics.

However,

once he said we were either for him or against him.

Since so many AIM members came to our office he

apparently felt we were on their side. I felt he

might also have learned of MEANS visit to my home

and this might have brought on the threat.

Every consideration shall be given to selecting individuals for the

program who are the best

qualified and can provide the highest quality

of service. The attainment of high level of education may be important

to performance in certain positions.

However, formal educational quali-.

fications, unless required by State

lack of fitness for the job. In the case of other positions, including

clerical and non-professional jobs, criminal records by themselves

shall not constitute a basis for disqualification for employment.

Before any person convicted of a felony can be employed, the CHR govern-

ing body shall conduct an investigation in accordance with fair stand-

ards and procedures and, it finds that the prior conviction does not

disqualify the person for the proposed position, the indifidual may be

OSCAR HOTLOW HORN, a resident of Hounded Knee, South Dalnta,

anvised that he had been emnloyed by the Office of Economic Opportunity, and

had been in charge of cocminting nmerous community programs, and that he

had a nersonal staff, and dimotly sunervised the staffs of each of these

coordinated pro-rams. Other than this information, HOLLOW HORN was unable

to provide a very complete descrintion of his activities or the nature of

his official duties.

The main reason for this inability was his very apparent

lack of recollection.

HOLLOW HORN stated that he had never signed any petition calling

for the ouster of Tribal Officers, and the only list he can recall having

signed at any time was a list of names passed around at his aunt's wake.

The take was in January, 1973. HOLLOW HORN was asked when his employment

was terminated, and ho was unable to recall. Furthermore, he was unable

to recall whether his employment, was terminated before of after his aunt's

wake.

BEE

HOLLOW HORN was unable to provide any deteils regarding the reason

for his termination, excent to state that he was having some trouble attending

staff mentires during the Wounded. Knee occuration, although he was free to

come and go as he pleage, HOLLOW HORN then stated that he had been placed

a two weet suspension after having raceived an oral warning, and he believed that

this suspension mas hared on his failure to atterd staff meetings boca se

there has been some roference to his annarent lock of interest in his job.

He did rot recall. if this reference was made during the pral warning by his

superiors or apneared in print.

He could not recall when this suspension

occurred, and eventually stated that he felt it may have securred before the

Wounded Knee occupation. He has never appealed this sation, because the idea

never occurred to him to do so.

He does not anticipate making an anneal in the

future. He does not feel that there was discrimination directed at him, bat

at the same time, felt that his termination was unfair. His reason for feeling

it was unfair was that it was based upon circumstances beyord his control,

namely, the inability to mintain a permanent residence neer his work, particularly

during the Wounded Knee oscupation.

No more detailed information other than that set forth could be

obtained from HOLLOW HORN, because all of his recollections of pertinent

details

ware varue and disoriented. HOLLOW HORN was not requested to

provide

a sirned staterent to any of the information he provided. He stated

that he knew nothing of the case involving CHRAIDINE JANIS, and, therefore,

would have no testimony of value to offer in that matter.

ALVIN ZEPHIER, Employment Supervisor, Oglala Sioux Tribal Council,

Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised that he had been a member of the Oglala

Sioux Tribe Personnel Policies Board, which is better known as the Evaluation

Committee, since June, 1972. His term of office lasted until April, 1973.

ZEPHIER advised that he was requesied to volunteer his services with no

remmeration as a member of the Rvaluation Committee, ard this rajest care

fron the Executive Board of the Oglaie Sioux Tribe,

The sole purpose of the

Executive Committee is to insure that when job vacanuies occur, ail applicants

for the vacancies are fairly and equitably considered, and that no favoritism

or discrimination is shown in filling available jobs.

ZEPHIER stated that the

committee was originally formed as a reaction to wide-spread complaints by

members of the tribe to the effect that discrimination, favoritism, and

nepotism

were being practiced with regard to hiring of new personnel.

The committee has no authority to make recommendations or take any type of

action in promotions, demotions, or terminations. The committee has no real

appellate authority with regard to employee grievances or terminations.

ZEPHIER resigned Irom the committee after serving only ten months,

mainly because of threatening phone calls he had received from the irate father

of an applicant who did not get a job. When the committee was originally

formed, it set up cettain grading standards whereby each prospective applicant

could

be numerically rated on the basis of the screening of his application

by members of the Executive Cormittee, The rating standarls established by the

conmittee are the only formal guidelines or regulations governing the activities

of the committee. ZEPHIER advised that although the original request for his

services had been made by the Executive Board of the tribe, he believes the

establishment of the committee was approved by resolution' of the Tribal

Council.

In April, 1973, GERALDINE JANIS, a former employee of the Community

Health Representative Services of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, was fixed by action

of the Executive Road. The reason for this termination was JANIS' vocal

advocation of the overthrow of the tribal government.

This situation was

compounded by JANIS' activities, which included marching in demonstrations

and meeting with dissidents during working, hours, havine submitted no annual

leave slips in connection with these activities. JANIS requested that the

Evaluation Committee heax an appeal regarding her termination and althouch the

committee made it clear that it did not have appellate authority in this matters

It finally agreed to hear the case presented by JANIS and her attorney, whose

name is unrecalled. At the time, JANIS appeared to be mainly concerned with

being paid for the annual leave that she had accrued up to the time of her

termination. However, the Executive Board was in the process of determining

the amount of time that JANIS had spent in non-employment related activities

during working hours, so that her annual. leave balance could be appropriately

adjusted prior to comouting termination cay.

The decision of the Evalvaiion Committee was to disquality itself

from rendering, a decision, and also to stand by the action of the Executive

Board in this matter.

ZEPHIER was personally present only for the first half of this

hearine, having nressing business in Rushville, Nebraska, and he set out to

attend to this business at the lunch-time adjournment of the hearing. He

consequently was not present for the final decision, but is in favor of

the action, and would have voted with the committee in their decision.

ZEPHIER feels that the termination of JANIS was necessary, and

that at no time did he ever suspect any unfair or purely discriminatory

attitudes or practices on the part of the Executive Boem or the Evaluation

Committee in their decisions involving TANIS.

Recause of pressins business, and the inconvenience of the circum

stances in atterdine this interview, ZEPHIER was unable to provide a signed

statement, but stated that he would be very willing to testify at a hearing

it necessary.

JOSEPH POURRIER, SR., Pine Ridge, South Dakota, advised that

he is one of five members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe Personnel Policies

Board, which is more commonly known as the Evaluation Conmittee,

POURRIER haS

been with the Evaluation Connittee since February, 1972,

and he was selected for service on this committee by the Executive Board

of the Delala Sioux Tribe:

POUPRIOR and the other four nerkers were all asked if thay

Hould volunteer for service with this connittee. In each instance, the

approach was made by a member of the Executive Board, and POURRIER

believes that the Evaluation Conmittee was approved by the Tribal

Council by means of a resolution,

The Evaluation Connittee was established because of a series

of complaints by members of the tribe to the effect that discrimination,

favoritism, and nepotism were being practiced to a great extent in the

for screening applications for available jobs and scoring all applicants

• for a job in an equitable manner so that the person most qualified to fit

the position opened is selected. The committee sets out a list of qualified

applicants for each job opening, listing the applicants by their rank and

the application evaluation. A number one person is therefore selected for

the job, but is subject to a 90 day probationary period during which time

the applicant can be fired as unsatisfactory in shich case the number two

applicant on the list fox that position would be hired. The comnittee

makes no recommendations and takes no actions direct or indirect regarding

pronotions, demotions or terminations,

Their activities are confined

strictly to insuring that fair and equitable hiring proceedures are followed

within the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

POURRIER advised that he recalled the termination of GERALDINE:

JANIS from her job as Community Health Services Representative and his

recollection was that she had been fired by the Executive Board of the

Oglala Sioux Iribe because of her open defiance of the Executive Board, her

stated desires to overthrow the current Tribal Council and the faot that

she participated in many demonstrations, meetings, and conferences with

militant American Indian Movement (AIM) personnel during working hours, and

did not subnit Annual Leave slips for these periods of time. POURRIER

recalled that in April, 1973, JANIS appeared at the Evaluation Committee

hearing with a Public Defender, name unrecalled, for the purpose of repealing

her casee The committee had advised JANIS that the Executive Board was

responsible for her termination and inasmuch as te Executive Board was a

higher authority than the Evaluation Committee, the actions of the Board

could not be appealed to this lower authority.

However, JANIS was

insistent so her appeal was heard by JOSEPH POURRIER, REVERAND GUY RONDELL.

and ALVIN ZIPHIER, noting that these three menbers of the committee

constituted a quorum. Also present was CALVIN SHANGREAUX, tha Personnel

Director of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. At the conclusion of the hearing, the

committee voted unanimously to advise JANIS that the committee would dis

qualify Itself from making any recommendations on this case for reasons

previously stated.

POURRIER recalls that the main thrust of the JANIS appeal was

payment for accrued Annual Leave. However, at the time, EMMA WILSON, a

member of the Executive Board, was in the process of determining how

much on the job time was spent by JANIS in non-employment related activities

so that this time could be deducted on her balance of accrued Annual Leave

for the purpose of determining how much termination pay JANIS was entitled

to receive.

"On July 24, 1973, I received permission

from Tony Fresquez to take the morning off to go

get a different car.

"My sister Lillian took me to the bank on

•July 24, 1973 and after waiting for me at the bank

she took me to Rushville, Nebraska to see if I

could purchase a car there. After tinding out 1

would be able to get the car, she returned to work.

I got the car and returned to work at the College

Center, I called my sister Lillian at her office

and she told me what Dick Wilson was saying about

him pulling a good one on me. Meaning that he had

gotten rid of me.

Dick Wilson also said that he

was getting ready for re-election and was getting

rid of all the people who weren't for him.

After

I finished talking to her on the phone I waited

for Tony Fresquez to come back into the office.

When he came back into the office I asked him what

was going on.

He said "Dick is the one that is

raising hell!! I went back to work then and worked

for the rest of the day.

"On July 25, 1973, I called Tony Fresquez and

told him that

was not going to work because the

Board of Directors did not approve of me working

there at the College Center so 1 was

just going to

quit. Tony Fresquez told me that the Board of

Directors were having a meeting on August 9, 1973

to confirm the job as a bookkeeper for the College

Center. I did not go to this meeting on August 9,

1973 because I felt it wouldn't do any good to try

to get the job when Dick Wilson was on the board and

we were told several times that Dick Wilson was

going to get rid of us, (Lillian and I).

"I believe I was enticed to resign my job at

the office of Economic Opportunity so the job of

Fiscal Manager at the office of Economic Opportunity

could be given to one of Wilsons'

supporters.

The

position I held at the Office of Economic Opportunity

was given to Helen Polmier.

As far as I know no one

has replaced me at the College Center as the bookkeeper.

ANTHONY JOSEPH FRESQUEZ was contacted at his

place of employment and after being advised of the

official identities of interviewing Agents, furnished

the following information:

FRESQUEZ advised that he preferred not to

furnish any signed statement at this time but would

discuss the matter in detail with the interviewing

Agents.

FRESQUEZ advised he is Executive Coordinator

of the Lakota Higher Education Center, better known as

the College Center located at the Pine Ridge Indian

Reservation, Pine Ridge, South Dakota. FRESQUEZ advised

he has been

so employed

since July, 1971, and his local

address was Post Office Box 332, Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

FRESQUEZ advised with regard to the hiring and

firing of CARMEL MEANS as bookkeeper for the College

center, he believed that MEANS was initially contacted

regarding the position of bookkeeper by FRANCIS KILLER,

who was a private accountant who the College Center con-

tracted to conduct an audit of their fiscal records during

the Summer of 1973.

FRESQUEZ advised that KILLER stated

that CARMEL MEANS was a bookkeeper and that the College

Center needed a permanent bookkeeper.

FRESQUEZ advised his initial contact with CARMEL

MEANS was when

she telephonically contacted him regarding

the position of bookkeeper and he told her if she would

apply then she would have just as good a chance as anyone

who applied for a position.

FRESQUEZ stated MEANS subse-

quently submitted an application and approximately one

week later he telephoned her and advised her to come to

work.

FRESQUEZ advised MEANS reported to work the following

Monday, July 23, 1973, and was employed until the morning

of July 26, 1973, when she telephoned him and advised that

she was resigning her position because she understood there

was some opposition to her working at the College Center.

FRESQUEZ advised the normal procedure for

hiring and tIring ci Colege Center employees is jor

a Board of Directors consisting of eight members to

review each application and recommend who should be

hired. FRESQUEZ continued by advising when a vacancy

needs to be filled, it is announced and the staff at

the College Center

• does the initial screening of all

the applicants and then this recommendation is relayed

to the Board of Directors. He advised approximately

80 per cent of the staff's recommendations are approved

by the Board of Directors.

With regard to CARMEL MEANS' employment,

FRESQUEL adVISed Mr. JAMES HAMM, Acting Director for the

college Center, had

authorized him to offer MEANS employ-

ment.

FRESQUEZ advised MEANS was the best qualified

applicant for the position and due to the urgency of the

job, she was hired

before the Board of Directors officially

met

and voiced their approval.

FRESQUEZ advised MEANS'

application would have been officially presented before

the Board of Directors at their next official meeting,

but that MEANS resigned prior to this happening. FRESQUEZ

advised although MEANS' application was not officially

BA MANGA

presented before the Board of Directors for approval prior

to her obtaining employment, this was not unusual as

several other employees had

been so hired by the College

Center.

FRESQUEZ advised he did not specifically state

for MEANS to terminate her employment with the Office of

Economic Opportunity (OEO) and apply for the bookkeeping

job at the College Center, but he probably implied that

in order for her to obtain the bookkeeping position she

would have to terminate her employment with OEO.

FRESQUEZ advised the position of bookkeeper at

the College Center is a merit job inasmuch as the Oglala

Sioux Tribe has a merit system.

FRESQUEZ stated no one instructed them (himself

and HAMM) to offer MEANS employment at the College Center.

ELMER LA POINIE, Acting Area Community Health

Representative and Program Coordinator for the Indian Health

Service, United States Public Health Service, Aberdeen, South

Dakota,

furnished the following information:

He is not employed by she Burcau of Indian Afairs

and has had his present position with the United States

Public

Health Service since Januazy, 1973.

He has never met GERALDINE JANIS, however, he knows

her through telephonic contact.

He recalls having telephonic conversation with

JANIS in which he discussed with her the matter of demonstrating.

He is certain that this call had as its purpose not the matter

of demonstrating, but some other reason, and he believes it was

concerning a contract amendment to enable the hiring of another

Community Health Representative.

The matter of demonstrating

was discussed as JANIS made inquiry about it. He advised her

that her activity while working within the contract under which

she was employed was of concern to the Government in that dur-

ing that time she should be working within the terms of the

contract at that time.

It is his understanding that JANIS and others had

been demonstrating in opposition to the general conditions on

the Reservation and not for the American Indian Movement or

against any particular Tribal Government.

The hiring, promotion, demotion and termination of

Community Health Representatives is a matter which is the

perogative of the Iribal Government. The Community Health

trogram is a contract program and is put into operation

following a representation made by a Tribal Government show-

ing need or justification.

When this justification is

mitted it is accomplished by a proposed budget.

Community Health Representatives grade level is in this pro-

posal.

If there are shortcomings' on the part of

Community Health Representatives at a particular Reservation,

the matter is taken up by Mr. LA POINTE with the Tribal

Government, generally through the Public Health Service

Unit Director of the Indian Health Service who is located

at the Reservation.

The tribe is then given options of

suggestions as to what may be done to improve a certain

situation or shortcoming. The action taken is the respon-

sibility of the Tribal Government.

Contracts with the Tribal Government on the many

Reservations in this regard are the same and there are

amendments to the contracts which deal with local geographic

Reverend GUY F. RONDELL,

Pine Ridge, South

Dakota, advised that he is an ordained minister with

the United Presbyterian Churches of the United States

of America.

He does not belong to the Oglala Sioux

Tribe but is a member of the Sisseton Wapeton Sioux

Tribe in South Dakota.

He has been a nomber of the

Evaluation Conmittee of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in Fine

MIagE, NONtO UAKOLA, SIDCE JaGUArY 1uIS.

He was

originally asked by RICHARD WILSON, President of the

Oglala Sioux Tribe, to volunteerhis services for

the Evaluation Comnittee in November 1972, but he did

not accept this request at that time. However, he

eventually began to feel that it was his duty to help

the people of the tribe, so he accepted a voluntary

appointment in January 1973. He advised that the sole

purpose of the Evaluation Committee is to insure that

job vacancies under the Office of Economic Opportunity

(OFO) are filled equitably with a complete lack of

discrimination, favoratism and nepotisn.

Before the formation of the Evaluation Committee,

many unfair practices were followed in the hiring of

persons for available jobs. Under the current procedures,

when a vacany is advertised, all of the persons interested

applications are revieved by

and are scored on the

basis of a nunerical system devised by the Commitice in

order to assure that everyone gets an equal chance to be

considered best qualified for the job. The result is that

the person having the

highest score is given first chance

at the available job.

It sometimes occurs that the person

selected by this method does not work out satisfactorily

and is subsequently torminated by his employer. This action

does not cone from the Committee. When this occurs, the

person who scored next highest is offered the job.

RONDELL

feels that since the Committee was established, there has

been a complete absence of discrininatory practices in

hiring, promoting and terminating of persons in the 0FO

programs.

her termination of employment as such was ever at issue.

She was further advised that if she wanted to be rehired

she would have to go to the Executive Board of the Oglala

Sioux Tribe because that is the authority which effected

her termination and inasmuch as it was a

higher authority

At no time prior to, during, or subsequent

to the appeal hearing, did JANIS male

any statements

indicating that she felt she had been unjustly discrim-

inated against in the loss of her job. The reasons for

her termination were that she had consorted with militant

AmerIcan IndIan roverent (Ath) troublemakers, had parti-

cipated in demonstrations and had openly advocated the

overthrow of the Tribal Government.

These actions were

compounded by the fact that she engaged in these activities

duxing working hours, but had not submitted annual leave

requests for time off to engage in these activities

RONDELL stated "II she had just kept her nose

out of these activities and kept her mind on her work

Iike everybody else, she wouldn't have had any problems".

employed in this capacity because HOLIOW HORN was here

whenshe came on the

job in November 1972.

She advised

that LELAND BEAR HUELS is no longer the Director of

Programs, but that she had an excellent recollection of

the circumstances surrounding admonishing of HOLLOW HORN

as well as his final termination.

Furthermore, she was

able to review records which are

described as time sheets

inasmuch as she is the official custodian of these records.

She recalled

that on February 15 and 16, 1973,

HOLLOW HORN was docked 12 hours pay for absence from an

in service training program.

This

is about the time he

was given an oral admonition by BEAR HEELS for his failure

to show up.

Later, because of continued absence from

meetings and training sessions, HOLLOW HORN was suspended

for two weeks and was charged leave without pay for the

period of March 12-23, 1973. TRUEBLOOD asked BEAR HEELS

at the time to put this suspension in writing, but he

never got around to doing it.

that if he would speak to the Director, he

would probably be given another chance. However, he never

He stated that GERALDINE JANIS has called him

approximately three times in reterence to this matter and

during one of these calls she stated that she preferred

to be fired instead of suspended from her position.

He

stated that no threats of any kind were made to her by him.

He stated that he was of the opinion that JANIS

wanted only pay for the accrued leave she had on the books.

He stated that this has been accomplished and that as far

as he is concerned the situation is settled.

He stated that the reason GERALDINE JANIS and

the other three individuals were fired was because they

demonstrated during working hours while they should have

been working at their respective jobs.

He stated that certain pieces of equipment were

missing from the office where GERALDINE JANIS worked and

he does not know whether or not this equipment was found.

He stated that these four individuals have filed

Janis stated that she and the other terminated persons

them, but to date the Executive Board has refused.

Janis further stated that she has corresponded with

the Executive Board, but the Board refuses to reply.

In addition, Janis called "Toby" Eaglebull, the

was terminated as Clerk of Courts because "she partici-

pated in a public demonstration advocating the overthrow

of the elected government of the Oglala Sioux Iribe."

On August 13, 1973, Means telephonically

(605/867-5356) advised Departmental attorney R. Dennis

Ickes that she broke her left arm in tour places on

January 16, 1973 and on DI. Guenther's advice (Rushville,

Nebraska) took sick leave from February 7, 1973 to

June 1, 1973. On March 8, 1973, Means participated

in a public demonstration on the lawn of the Bureau

of Indian Affairs Building in Pine Ridge. On March 6,

1973, Means assisted in drafting a petition against the

tribal government and helped obtain signatures as well

as signing it herself. On March 29, 1973, Sidney Witt,

tribal prosecutor, told Means that she had been suspended

HH 55293 DocId:32989685 Page 454

## Page 455

from her job and gave her a memorandum to that effect.

According to Means, suspension is temporary until a

hearing

is held at which time a decision is made con-

cerning her employment. However, Means stated that

she received no hearing and learned through friends

on approximately April 21, 1973 that she had been

fired by the Oglala Sioux Tribe Executive Committee

on April 4, 1973. No written notice of her firing

was received by Means.

telephone conversation. Also, obtain copies of the

concerning his recommendation for

Means.

saying she was suspended.

(c)

upon Means' employment and termi-

nation as Clerk of Courts.

Also in the Departmental attorney's telephone

conversation with Janis on August 9, 1973 referred to

above, Janis alleged that other tribal employees had

been fired because of their participation in public

demonstrations or in signing circulated petitions.

Janis noted that Carmel Means

was enticed into resigning

a merit-protected job as fiscal manager for the local

Office of Economic Opportunity with the promise that

she would be given a job at the Pine Ridge College Center

with a higher salary; but that she was fired two days

later by Dick Wilson who was on the College's Board of

Directors which had to approve all hirings.

5787). She stated that she had been fiscal manager

for Office of Economic Opportunity for a year at a

salary of $9,780 per year and had been an employee of

Office of Economic Opportunity since 1968. Jim Hand

and Tony Erescas (phonetic), both in administration

at the College Center, promised Means that it she

resigned from the Office of Economic Opportunity she

could get a job as bookkeeper at the College Center

for §10,000 per year.

They promised that the Board

of Directors of the Center had indicated that they

wanted only Means to work there.

According to Means, she

resigned from the

Office of Economic Opportunity on July 20, 1973

and started work at the Center on July 23, 1973

and worked until July 24, 1973 when Frescas told

her that Dick Wilson was

"raising hell" about the

Center hiring her; therefore, Means was fired. She

was told by Frescas that she

could appear before the

Center's Board of Directors meeting on August 9, 1973

and apply for the job. Means said she did not attend

the August 9, 1973 meeting because she knew she would

not get the job based on her July 24, 1913 experience

with Frescas and Wilson's opposition. Means believes

that she was enticed into resigning her job at the

Office of Economic Opportunity so that the Office of

Economic Opportunity position could be used to reward

a supporter of Wilson. Means stated that Helen Palmier

replaced her at the Office of Economic Opportunity, but

DE We DEMe

does not know who replaced her at the Center.

Means stated that she signed a petition to

replace the tribal constitution and has associated

with Janis. According to Janis, Wilson has made the

statement in the presence of Lillian Cooney (sister.

to Carmel Means) and Karen Trueblood (an Office of

Economic Opportunity employee) that he was starting

his campaign for re-election as tribal chairman

already and that he would fire all of those who

worked against him and would hire his friends.

Means believes that Cooney will share her infor-

mation with investigating agents, but that Trueblood

may be afraid to cooperate. Means noted that similar

tactics have been attempted on Cooney who also works

at the Office of Economic Opportunity.

Janis further alleged in her telephone con-

versation that Oscar Hollow Horn, a former Office

of Economic Opportunity coordinator at Manderson,

South Dakota, and a current resident of wounded

Knee was fired because he "was not interested in

his job."

Hollow Horn had signed the above described

petition.

with Dick Wilson, Tribal Chief of the Oglala Sioux Indians. Mr. Cotter

advised CHlet WiIson thät he was there as a representative from FBI

Headquarters to assure the Chief that the FBI would-do everything we

could to assist in training members of his Iribal Police Force.

POlice Training Coordinator of the Minneapolis FBI Office and two

especially selected police instructors conferred with the Chief on the

nature of the training needed. Chief Wilson wanted to give the new

officers eight hours of training and put them out on patrol with an

experienced officer.

PiNe Ridge, S. D.

Inspector Cotter and the Police Training Coordinator put.

together a preliminary program of 18 hours which they felt was a

minimum requirement. Chief Wilson said that they had been able to hire

41 individuals, some of whom had college degrees, and he was pleased

that the caliber of the people they were employing was above average.

The program put together included firearms training in shoulder weapons,

techniques and mechanics of arrest, basic and investigative techniques

covering the protection of crime scenes and interviewing, law as it

applies to Indian versus Indian on the reservation, patrol procedures,

identification of explosives and anti-sniper and survival tactics.

The program was set up to be held six hours a day for three days after

which time the trainees would be put with an experienced Indian officer.

The Chief was most appreciative that the FBI had taken such

special interest in providing training töchis people.

He said the FBI

was the only agency that had kept its promises to him'änd, speaking

very frankly, he said that the FBI was

trusted by his people.

ALBERT DALE;

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Vincent Brewer, former Executive Director, and

Hobart Keith, Board member, both of the Oglala Sioux Housing

Authority, line Ridge, south Dakota, Indian Reservation, have

advised the Oglala Sioux Tribe has borrowed approximately two

million dollars with which to construct homes on the Pine

Ridge indian Reservation.

They advised the money was borrowed

from the Public Housing Administration, an agency of the U.s.

Government, with the money to be repaid by the tribe.

Part of

the agreement the tribe entered into with the Public Housing

Administration was that the latter would furnish a man to supervise

construction of the buildings. Heintzelman has been given this

job.

Brewer alleges a Board of Commissioners, consisting of

the Reservation superintendent, several local persons,

and

Albert Dale as treasurer, has been set up to oversee the project.

He described Dale as the owner of a bank in Rushville, Nebraska,

and also a stockholder in the Rushville Lumber Company.

It is alleged that Heintzelman has failed to open and

accept bids for materials as specified at the time the bids are

let.

He has accepted bids on his own, without the Commissioners

approval, from companies which he contacted after opening original

bids received.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

building materials used, and that in almost every instance,

Brewer claims wholesale

lumbermen have advised him a retail lumber business, such

as the kushville Lumber company, could not submit such low bids

profitably.

It is also alleged that Richard Wilson, who is in charge

of the plumbing work on the project, has used materials irom

the housing project to construct a home, a basement, and a

partially finished plumbing shop, with the knowledge of

Heintzelman. None oi this material has apparently been paid ior.

Brewer advised there are several other instances

where materials from the project have been used to put additions

onto homes

on the reservation, apparently with Heintzelman's

knowledge.

Keith advised he purchased a furnace from Wilson,

which came from a home that was removed from the project.

furnace, together with other appliances in the home, were to be

sold to

the highest bidder. Instead, Heintzelman gave them to

Wilson, who in turn sold at least part of them.

Efforts on the part of keith to examine project records

have been thwarted, although he claims he is entitled to

examine such records as a Board member.

Special Officer James I. Fail, Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

has advised the funds involved are actually property of the U.s.

Government.

Investigation is being conducted regarding the

allegations.

HEINTZELMAN denies

any improper activities, claims property being disposed of in a

"ALBERT DALE is a banker at Rushville,

Nebraska. It is my understanding he also owns a

thirty one-per cent interest in the Rushville Lumber

Co. I do not know for sure, but it appears to me

that half or more of the building materials in the

housing project have been purchased from the Rushville

Lumber Co. I have no information as to the bids sub

mitted by this company.

"I have never been really sure just what

HEINTZELMANs authority is, however, I know that as

a matter of practice he has been letting bids for

materials entirely on his own.

He has not consulted

the Board about any bids he has accepted or declined.

"In about April, 1963 I hired DICK WILSON to

put in some soil pipe at my home. WILSON furnished the

materials, and I do not know where they came from.

I gave him forty five or fifty dollars for this.

"About this time WILSON told me he had a

furnace for sale so I bought it, paying wILson

seventy five dollars for it. The furnace is in my

home now.

"Later I became suspicious for some reason or

other, so I asked WILSON where he had obtained the

furnace.

As nearly as I can recall WILSON said,

it's all right, I've got a deal with either the boss

or HEINTZELMAN.

I don't remember just how he did

refer to HEINTZELMAN. I believe the furnace I bought

is a Bryant, and I'm quite sure, although I can't

prove it, that this furnace

came from the DEWEY

• house.

"The CLIFFORD house had to be moved from its

foundation, and moved to another location in the

housing project.

The Housing Authority bought the

house, but I'm not sure what was to be done with the

appliances and furnishings in the house.

"I

also agreed to paint a picture for WILSON.

In payment WILSON gave me a pressure tank which I

I actually

picked the tank up from where it was lying on

the

ground near where the lumber storage yard is at

the Housing project.

• "I know a basement was built at the BILL

SALWAY home in Pine Ridge early in the fall of 1963.

I know the materials were from the Housing project,

and the basement was built by worknen on the

project payroll. This was a deal HEINTZELMAN arranged

for, and I do not know who is to be paid for it.

"I have no other personal knowledge of this

matter, except that to my knowledge the Board of

Commissioners never authorized HEINTZELMAN to sell

or dispose of any of the project materials.

"I also entered into a verbal agreement with

HEINTZELMAN, before I went on the Board of

Commissioners, to paint a large emblem for two

hundred and seventy tive dollars, and to paini

desigus on shutters of the houses in Project SD 1-1

for six hundred dollars. I did noc submit a

written bid on this, and to my knowledge no one else

did either.

I received all this money.

S.D. 1-3. It is my belief DANA gets along with

HEINTZELMAN because he has followed HEINTZELMAN'S

recommendations.

I told him when he started that he

would have to feel

HEINTZELMAN out to see what he

wanted, and DAnA indicated to me he was going to do

this.

DANA is the son in law of BILL HEWITT of

Rushville, Nebraska.

"I believe $787,000 was actually spent on

S. D. 1-1.

"Bids for materials were to be obtained by

advertising for them.

The advertisements specified

the bids were to be opened at a specified date and

It was my understanding they were to be opened

in the presence of the Board of Commissioners, and

accepted or rejected by the Board.

"As a matter of practice when the bids came in

they would be held by the secretary, and given to

HEINTZELMAN when he came in. He would then open

the bids himself, wherever he felt like it. He

would accept or reject bids as he chose, without con-

sulting the Board. I know personally of a few bids

he accepted which were the lowest bids submitted.

I

also know of a few instances where he accepted bids

higher than the lowest bids, claiming the materials

in the lower bids were not what he wanted.

"The only instance I know of where he consulted

the Board on a bid was on bricks for S.D. 1-2. In

this instance the Board accepted a certain type of

brick, but HEINTZELMAN later changed this on his own,

and put up a different brick.

"Once advertisements were put out for fifty

When

he took the bias and went to Minneapolis

When he

came back he said he had bought the stoves aud

refrigerators from some compary out of Chicago.

This

company had not submitted a bid originally.

He did

get these cheaper than the lowest bid originally sub-

mitted.

"It seemed to me the vast majority of the

building materials for the projects were supplied

by the Rushville Lumber Co, although i couldut

tell what percentage of the total materials the

company did supply.

I recall seeing sone of

the bids,

and it seemed to me the rushrille Lunber Co.

bids were

always just a little bit lower than the rext lowest

bidder.

I do

not know in what

manner HEINTZELMAN

obtained these bids.

two different occasions, salesuen for two

different wholesale lumber companies toid me they

could not understand how a retail luber company aber

as Rushville Lumber, could underbid & wholesale

company.

"HEINTZELMAN tOld me once

the houses were running

between ten and eleven thousand dollars apiece.

This

did not include streets, curbs, landscaping, ete.

"I know regulations required any surplus materials

were to be put out on bids, and sold to the highest

bidder. I am quite sure no one had any authority to

sell materials, except for surplus materials to the

highest bidder.

"HEINTZELMAN told me he gave the old blocks from

the CLIFFORD house to DICK WILSON.

We had to get them

out so we could put a street through there.

WILSON

was going to use the blocks

to build a basement for

himself.

"I then saw WILSON take one hundred and ten

brand new blocks that belonged to the Housing

Authority. As I recall he hauled them away in the

Housing Authority truck. I asked him about this,

and he told me HEINTZELMAN had told him it was O.K.

for him to move them, and he could take what he

wanted.

"I then called HEINTZELMAN iN WILSON's presence.

CHARLEY HEINTZELMAN said to let it go, as DICK was

going to pay for them.

WILSON then took four hundred

more blocks. WILSON aso took thirty sacks of cement,

three or four sacks of lime, and sore sand.

"The blocks were worth twenty six cents apiece,

the lime and cement were worth about ninety six cents

a sack, and the sand worth approximately fifteen to

twenty dollars. I made WILSON sign a receipt for

these materials. WILSON then used the materials to

build a block basement in Pine Ridge.

"This happened in July, 1962. Just a few days

ago WILSON told me he had

I his bills, but had never

paid for the materials.

"The DEWEY CLIFFORD house had to be moved from

the project area.

The Housing Authority bought the

house.

CHARLEY told WILSON tO disconnect the furnace,

jet pump, hot water heater, plumbing fixtures etc.

WILSON did disconnect the fixtures, but took them to

his home. I later saw the articles at WILSON's home

and told him to take them to the project yard. He

said he would return them, but he never did.

"I know the furnace by sight, and I know this

is the same furnace WILSON sold to HOBART KEITH.

"I believe FRANK E, COFFEY, SR. bought the rest

of the stuff from WILSON. Actually all of this should

have been sold on bid to

the highest bidder.

To my

knowledge WILSON never turned this money in.

"In the fall of 1963, in about September, WILSON

built a complete new home

for his mother in Pine Ridge.

I saw JIM BIG CROW, who WILSON had hired, hauling

materials from the project to the site of the house

in a Housing Authority truck.

This movement of

materials took place on weekends.

WILSON once told

me he had about eight hundred dollars worth of

materials in this house.

"In the fall of 1963, in about October, WILSON

and JAMES RED WING started building a cement block

building in Pine Ridge.

WILSON told me he was going

to use one part of it for a plumbing shop. I don't

recall what he said RED WING was going to use the

other

part for.

"I saw BIG CROW hauling new blocks from the

housing project area in a Housing Authority truck

to the site of this building. I believe the sand, lime,

and cement for the building came from the project

also.

I would estimate there are about eighteen hundred blocks,

worth four hundred and sixty eight dollais in the building.

There is approximately ninety six dollars worth of lime

and cement, and about sixty dollars worth of sand in the

building.

"JESSIE EAGLE REART told me She had made an

arrangement with CHARLEY to have at addition put

on her house. I KNOW MYLES TYLER supervised the

job, and project workmen did the works and were paid

from Housing Authority funds. I do not know what

financial arrangements were made on this.

"Said on ore occasion CORDON REICHENBURG, Who

lives

in Rushville, Nebraska, told me HEINIZELMAN

was getting

all the windows

for his new house for

him. I dod't know if the windows were to come

from the housing project or not. This occurred in

the summer of 1963.

"During the

summer of 1963 HUGH JOHN BLACKSMITH,

who was timekeeper on the housing project, built

an addition on to his house. I know part of the

materials were ordered from

the Rushville lumber

yard, but part of the materials he trucked from the

project to his home at night in a housing project

The only answer he

ever gave me was, 'He's going to pay for it.

"I made all the bank deposits of all receipts

dida't physically make all the deposits, but I did

check and.lst all deposits and once in awhile

BLACKSMITH would physically deposit it.

"Northwest Pipe Fitting Co. of Rapid City,

South Dakota had all the plumbing costracts with

the Housing Authority.

I know HEINTZELMAN and a

former assistant manager of this company were very

close to each other.

"DICK WILSON had a free hand in ordering from

this company.

to me he was constantly

ordering sonething from this company. I believe he

ordered much more plumbing materials than were

No

hired.

•"I do not know how the letting of bids was

done, and I had nothing to do with this. I know

nothing about the organizational set up of the

Housing Authority on the administrative procedures

that were followed.

"The DENEY CLIFFORD home had to be moved in

project S.D. 1-1 as it was in the middle of where

a street was to go.

The house itself was reused,

but the basement had to be torn out.

"Mr. HEINTZELMAN gave me the cement blocks from

this home just to get them out of there.

I salvaged

fOUr

or five hundred blocks from the CLIFFORD

house, and used them in the construction of a base-

ment 1a Pine Ridge. I planned to build a house

on the basement.

"There were not enough of the CLIFFORD house

to finish the basement, so I got four or five

hundred new cement blocks from the project to

finish my basement.

I hauled these blocks from the

project site to my basement in a Housing Authority

truck on Sundays and in the everings. I had

authority to use this truck for my personal use if

I furnished the gas for it, which I did.

"Before taking any of the new blocks I asked

he told me to go ahead and take them.

"While taking them VINCENT BREWER asked me if

I had made arrangements to get the blocks. I told

him I had.

I dida't specify what materials

I wanted, and the only arrangements I made to pay for

them was

that I told him I would pay whatever the

Housing Authority paid for the materials.

There was

no mention made of who I was to pay or when I was to

In my own mind I felt I was to pay the housing

"I obtained these materials in about July or

august, 1962. Up to the present time I have not

been billed for them, and I have not yet paid for them.

"I know that a house I helped physically build for

my mother, JULIA WILSON, was built entirely with

materials fron the housing project. My mother made

all the arrangements for this through Mr. BERGEN, and

I had nothing to do with arranging for or paying for

these materials.

"Mr. HEINTZELMAN told me to renove everythiug

from the CLIFFORD house so it could be moved. He

told me to store the stuff I took out. I took a

furnace, a pump, a tub, a stool, a lavatory, a kitchen

sink and stove from the house.

I also took a pressure

tank, which was part of the pump.

"At that time the Housing Authority had no storage

area, so I stored the articles in a shed owned by my

mother. This was in about August, 1962. I remember

VINCENT BREWER asking me later if I had these

articles, and I told him I did. I do not recall him

telling me to return them to the project.

twenty five feet of soil pipe and six fittings at

KEITH'S,, and about fifteen feet of soil pipe and

I have held these positions since

September, 1963.

"In 1961 a contract was entered into between the

Housing Authority and the Public Housing Administra

The agreement was the P.H.A. would loan the

money to the Authority.

The Authority then sold

bonds and repaid the goverment. P.H.A. then pays

the interest on the bonds and guarantees their payment.

"CHARLES HEINTZELMAN was assigned by P.H.A. as

its representative on the local projects.

I am not

sure what is the authority of HEINTZELMAN or the

Executive Director. The Housing Authority is actually

responsible for the entire project. I do not know

how far HEINTZELMAN's authority extends insofar as the

handling of bids and contracts are concerned. It is

my understanding HEINTZELMAN has, as a matter of

practice, handled the awarding of bids and contracts

with the assistance of his office staff.

"It appears HEINTZELMAN has been acting both

as P.H.A. representative and supervisor for the

Housing

Authority. I believe he is paid only by

"There

is a

stipulation, either in the contract

stating the Housing Authority

can buy or sell the

same as any other corporation.

There is also a

letter in file from the Tribal Attorney stating

it is within the authority of the Housing Authority

to sell materials to the Indian people to use in

fixing up sanitation in their homes.

In my opinion

there are no limitations on the sale of materials, but

I feel it is the responsibility of the housing authority

to make sure this doesn't get out of hand.

"At the end of forty years when the bonds are

paid off, the entire project is turned over to the

Tribe by

the government.

Until that time, the

government has the right to inspect the property,

terminate the contract, and actually is totally in

Should the Public Housing

Administration feel anything is wrong, it can take the

whole project away from the Housing Authority.

"Insofar as to the actual letting of bids and

accepting of cortracts, I have no knowledge of the

mechanics involved.

I have never had any reason to

question the correctness of the procedures being

used.

To my knowledge HEINTZELMAN has never dis-

cussed any bids or contracts with the Housing Authority.

"I do not know what procedure was supposed to

be followed in the disposal of such items as thosein

the CLIFFORD house.

"I do not know why the first architectural firm

left the project. Craig and Brooks was fired by the

Housing Authority on HEINTZELMAN's recommendation.

The architects claimed inferior or cheaper materials

were being used in the buildings than their speci

fications called for. It is true less expensive

materials were being used, on HEINTZELMAN's recommen-

dation, as we had to stay

within the limits of the

funds we had available.

"I do not feel that any changes made in the

specifications materially altered the quality or

usefulness of the buildings to any significant

degree.

All the changes had to be approved by

the Board, and were minor changes.

"I have never to date had any reason to

suspect or believe there has been anything wrong in

the housing project in Pine Ridge.

"I want to state I am not sure if the

original contract between P.H.A.

and the Housing

Authority was entered into in

1961 or 1962.

"Actually Craig and Brooks objected to all

of the proposed changes and modifications wanted

by the Housing Authority.

Also the Authority felt

the firm was not fulfilling all of the terns of

their contract.

This is why the firm was dis-

charged.

Actually HEINTZELNAN did not recommend

dismissing the firm, but he is the one that recom

mended the proposed modifications.

was

interviewed in the presence of Special ificer JAMEs f. fAIL.

STANDS advised he is the Chairman of the Oglala Sioux Housing

Authority. He also stated he has a lourth grade education,

and cannot read or write very well.

STANDS furnished the following information.

He is not very familiar with the financial or

organizational structure of the Oglala Sioux Housing

Authority,

and does not know if the Housing Authority has

paid back to the Public Housing Administration, the money

originally borrowed from it.

All bids and contracts were handled by Mr.

HEINTZELNAN Or MYLES TYLER, the Construction Superintendent,

and no one ever discussed

any bids with him.

The Housing Authority members, and not HEINZELiAN,

wanted changes made in the plans submitted by architects.

When the architects refused to go along with the requested

changes, the Authority, acting on its own initiative, fired

the

architects.

The Housing Authority orally agreed that local

Indians could buy materials from the housing project for use

in their

own construction jobs on the reservation. The

purchasers were to repay the Authority for any naterials they

bought.

He believes only materials to, be used in adding

bathrooms to homes were to be sold.

He does not know for sure

if the authority was extended to sell materials for other

uses or not.

Sometimes bids would be opened by the Authority,

and sometimes by HEINTZELMAN. The Authority as a whole would

decide which bid to accept.

He does not know if HEINTZELMAN

ever accepted may bids on his own or not. to his knowledge

HEINTZELMAN always let contracts on the bids accepted by

the authority, and did not make any unvarranted changes.

The Authority members did look at various materia. samples

submitted with bids, and would then decide which bid it

wanted to accept.

the Executive Director and the Superintendent of

The minutes of June 18, 1962, corrected and adopted

the previous minutes to read that the Housing Authority

delegates to

the brecutive Director and the superintendent

oi construction the authority to incur obligations for labor

and materials subject to approval of the Public Housing

Administration representative, and that all purchase orders

after clearance may be signed

The minutes of January 19, 1962, contain remarks

by Superintendent TOWLE stating the Tribe is to sell bonds

to the Federal Reserve Bank, to obtain money to start the

housing project.

Each year

the amount of the bonds becoming

due are redeened by appropriations from the United States

Government to the Public Housing Administration.

This money

would not have to be repaid by the Housing Authority or the

Date February 18, 1964

ALBERT DALE, President, Stockmen's National Bank,

was interviewed at the Stockmen's National Bank, at which time

was advised the purpose of the interview was

to secure

information relative to some complaints of possible wrong-

doing in connection with the construction of some 127 private

homes and a 23-unlt old folks home at the Pine Ridge Indian

Reservation, Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

DALE was advised he didmt have to submit to an

interview, that he need not provide any information, that any.

Information he might provide could be used against him, and

that he was

entitled to discuss this matter with an attorney, if

he so desired.

DALE waS

further informed that in a matter such as

this that might involve possible fraud against the government

the interviewing agent had authority to conduct such an inter-

view under oath.

DALE stated he had expected an interest in the matter

on the part of the FBs que to the fact he knows a number of

rumors have been going about the reservation involving CHARLES

EDWARD HEINIZELMAN, Inspector for the Public Housing Administration.

DALE stated it was his sincere wish to cooperate in

every way possible in an effort to refute once and for all these

very vicious rumors which according to him threaten the entire

effort, to improve the living conditions of the sioux Indian

nation.

DALE further stated he had absolutely nothing to

hide, did not desire to consult with an attorney, and would

consent to be interviewed under oath.

DALE was placed under oath by SA ROBERT D. KINSEY.

Nebraska, to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. DALE noted he accepted

this duty, feeling it was a publio service due to the fact he

felt the purpose of the project which was to improve the slum

Ilving conditions of the Sioux Indians was a most worthy under-

taking.

DALE stated the project has been going on for about

three years and original

funds to start the project were advanced

by an agency of the U. S. Government, as he recalls the Public

He stated the advance money was not

received nearly fast enough to pay off the varlous contractors

and laborers on the job and much of the sum of $1,500,000.00 was

secured through temporary notes to the National City Bank of

New York, New York;City, New York. He stated bonds to cover the

total cost, approximately $2,500,000.00 for the whole project, already

have been advertised and will be issued and placed on sale by the

Hartford National Bank and Trust Company, Hartford, Connecticut,

at 2:30 p.M., March 2, 1964.

opinion some U. S. Government funds will be involved as the

Government is subsidizing the sum olearance program on the Pine

Ridge Indian Reservation.

DALE stated the aim of the project, in addition to

providing

a total of some 127 new private homes and a 23-unit

old folks home, also has provisions to repay Indians whose

homes are destroyed or moved to make room for the new units

as well as providing assistance to Indians who desire to

modernize and repair existing residences.

DALE advised a body known as the Oglala Sioux

Housing Authority was set up and this group consists of the

following persons:

SAMUEL STANDS, Chairman;

Secretary;

LEWELLEN KINGSLEY, EX-Officio Member;

C. HOBARD KEITH, Member of the Board;

ALBERI DALE, Treasurer,

DALE noted that neither himself nor any other member

of the Authorlty is a builder and the entire project is being

overseen by a Mr. CHARLES EDWARD HEINIZELMAN, Inspector,

Public Housing Administration (PHA) • He said HEINIZELMAN

resides in Miñneapolis, Minnesota, but works out of the FRe

Headquarters at chicago, Lilinois, and usually spends about

every. other week at the site of the Pine Ridge project.

DALE noted

• a CHARLES A. REED is projeCt manager,

a MILES TAYLOR 1s construction superintendent for the bullding

of the individual residences, and a Mr. ARNOLD WALTERS 18

construction foreman for the old. folks home.

DALE related he has complete confidence in the

ability and integrity of HEINIZELMAN and he has been given

complete authority to act for the OSHA. He said HEINIZELMAN

handles the advertising and publication of the bids, accepts

or rejects these bids subject to review by his superiors,

PiA at Chicago, and generally is responsible for the entire

project.

DALE stated the programing of the slum clearance on

the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, in addition to providing

Ior the new private homes and for the construction of a 23-unit

old folks home, also provided for the remodeling of existing

homes and under this authority it was

permissible for the OSHA

to sell to Individual Indians materials from OSHA building stock-

piles for these repairs and renovations.

In this connection, DALE stated he recalled several

Indians had purchased siools and lavatories from OSHA to ada

bathrooms to their residences and he also recalled a WILLIAM

GOINGS secured sufficient materials to add a room to his

residence.

DALE stated a close accounting 1s maintained for

all such transactions, which he described as quite numerous.

out he did not feel the entire amount expended would be much

In this connection he noted PHA in Chicago sends

out an auditor who regularly audits the entire operation at

the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation for all phases of the

construction.

DALE stated very good progress 1s being made on all

components of the construction, noting the old folks home 1

scheduled to

construction 1s between 40% and 50% complete.

In further reference to bids solicited for

construction, DALE noted regulations provide the calling for

bids be advertised, specifications are described, a letting

date is set, and it is required that three bids be secured.

He said he has never had any suspicions that the entire handling

of the bids was not completely fair, honest and above board.

DALE advised he was well aware of the fact that a

local lumber yard at Rushville, Nebraska, the Rushville

Lumber and Coal Company, has provided a considerable amount,

probably at least 50-60% of the total lumber used on the

project.

He said this appeared very logical to him as this yard

i8 much

closer to the project than yards at Rapid City, South

Dakota, and other sizeable South Daota cities.

As a result

of their proximity to the project the Rushville Lumber and

Coal Company has definite shipping advantages which in his

opinion would allow this concern to underbid more remotely

Located competitors.

DALE stated he has absolutely no financial interest

In the Rushville Lumber and Coal Company and after checking

bank records to be certain advised the bank has absolutely

no loans to this concern.

DALE related he has no information to indicate bids

for lumber that may have been made by the Rushville Lumber

and Coal Company are handled in any fashion or in any way

different from the handling of the many types bids accepted

for the multitude of different items used on the project.

CURTISS was Informed certain allegations had been

made relative to the volume of material his company had provided

for the construction of a number of private homes and an old

folks unit under the Publio Housing Authority (PHA) at Pine

He was further advised that allegations

had been made indicating his company mighi possibly have been

provided preferential treatment in bidding and might have been

given advance information relative to the bids submitted by

competing bidders.

CURTISS was further informed he did not have to make

any

statement; that any statement he might make could be used

against him in court,and that he was entitled to the services

of an attorney if he

so desired.

CURTISS was also advised that since this investigation

involved possible fraud against the U.S. Government, interviewing

agent had the authority to question him under oath if he was

agreeable. CURTISS advised he could not understand how such

allegations could be made, that he and his firm were entirely

innocent of any wrongdoing and he stated he desired to cooperate

fully.

CURTESS was placed under oath by SA ROBERT D. KINSEY.

CURTISS advised he personally had handled virtually

all business associated with the public housing being

constructed at the fine hiage inolan Reservation, Pine Riage,

South Dakota.

In particular, CURIISS advised he had handled all

the bids submitted for materials furnished by his company for

this job.

CURIISS said he would then figure out his bid and

submit it through normal channels.

CURTISS emphatically stated neither CHARLES

HeINIGELMAN, Who he Knows as the Inspect Ior the Public

Housing Administration, nor anyone else has ever given him

any information as to the amounts of the bids submitted by

any other firm and neither has he or his company ever been

made an offer by anyone to help his company get any contracts

on the Pine Ridge project in any way other than through normal

and legitimate business procedures.

CURTISS volunteered that his company has served the

Pine Ridge Reservation, which is only a little over twenty miles

from Rushville, Nebraska, for years and has a truck which makes

daily deliveries to the area. He noted he was in a much better

position to serve the project on the basis of a favorable

position as far as shipping charges were concerned and he could

normally be expected to be able to underbid suppliers from a

greater distance from the project.

He also advised that in 1962 before the aaministrative

controls were completely set up on the project he was able to

supply a considerable amount of material which was needed

immediately and could be purchased locally without the letting

of bids.

He said his company would realize its normal margin

of profit on such sales,

but since 1963 almost all items have

been supplled to the project under sealed bids and to supply

such material it is necessary for him to bid on a very small

profit margin.

CURIISS further advised he considers CHARLES

HEINIZELMAN as doing an excellent job on the project and in

protecting the interests of the Sioux Indians and the U. s.

Government.

CURTISS stated ALBERT DALE, President of the

Stockmen's National Bank, Rushville, Nebraska, owns no stock

Ih his company and his company has no loans with the Stockmen's

National Bank.

When the project is substantially completed,

permanent tinancing is arranged, which consists of bonds

Issued by the local housing authority. These bonds are

serial bonds, which mature over a period of 40 years and

PHA guarantees the principal and interest to the extent

provided

for in the Annual Contributions Contract. These

bonds are sold to private investors. The bond indenture

provides for a fixed annual payment which will liquidate

the total obligation over a period of 40 years. Under

which the local housing authority does not have funds to

meet from its operations. This payment is limited under

the contract to a certain amount, however, in practice it

Is usuaLly suIticient to liquidate 100 per cent of the cost

ot the project it required.

With regard to the Pine Ridge, South Dakota,

Indian reservation housing project, PHA

was approached by

a Washington, D. C. law firm representing the Indian tribe

to determine

whether it could qualify for low rent housing.

It was informed that it could by meeting the requirements of

the Housing Act which meant organizing a legally constituted

housing authority.

This was done and the Oglala Sioux Housing

Authority ,(OSHA) became such authority. The preliminary

planning conract was entered into by PHA with OSHA in

september, 1961, and eventually the project was approvea and

an Annual Contributions Contract was entered into in June,

Ins project actually included three projects, two

si which were covered in the initial contract, and the thiro

added as an amendment to the contract. Advances to finance

initial construction were made by PHA to OSHA beginning in

June, 1962, and the initial series of temporary notes to

finance contruction were issued by OSHA in about November,

1962. The third and last series of temporary notes matured

January 10, 1964.

Permanent financing, consisting of bonds,

has been arranged and the bonds sold and to be delivered

March 3, 1964.

As there was a short interval between maturity

of the

temporary notes and delivery of the bonds representing

permanent financing, PHA advanced sufficient funds to pay off

the principal and interest of the temporary notes which matured

on January 10, 1964. This amounted to $1,576,613.71.

Accordingly, OSHA is indebted to PHA at the present time in that

amount plus interest on the said amount from January 10, 1964,

at 3 7/8 per cent.

This indebtedness will be liquidated upon

Jelivery of the bonas constituting the permanent Iinancing or

Harch 3, 1964. These bonds will total s1, 690,000 and the 1ixec

annual paynent will amount to $79,230.

This method was explained as one

whereby Tribal Authority will utilize the available labor force and

direct the construction work thenselves.

As indicated, the above described documents were

the file of requests

for advances submitted by OSHA and copies

of some approvals by the Fiscal Branch of PHA, however, these

advance by PHA to OSHA on the project was made on or about June

14, 1962. The latest and last requisition for funds. by OSHA

was dated October 22, 1963, and related to the advance to be

made by PHA to pay oif the

temporary notes which matured on

January 10, 1964, and provided for advance totalling $1, 576, 613.71,

covering all three projects.

It was noted that the toal estimated development cost

for the three projects per the contract was $2,279,708, whereas

IE. ARNOLDS advised the permanent financing consisting of the

bonds of ostA totalled $1,690,000. ARNOLDS stated that the

total bond issue represents the total cost for construction

of the three projects and explained that when the permanent

bonds are to be issued a minimum development cost determination

is made and this is used as the total of the bond issue by the

local housing authority.

Re added that it it develops an

additional amount is needed, which would usually be a small

percentage, PHA can make a direct loan to the local housing

authority.

ARNOLDS advised that the project in every case,

ARNOLDS also advised that if irregularities occurred

on the Pine Ridge or any project resulting in an increase in

the total cost of the project, there would be a correspording

increase in the U. S. Government's annual contribution and,

therefore, the Government would suffer a loss.

HAROLD BROW, Chief of the Construction Section,

Chícago Regional Office, Public Housing Administration (PIA),

185 Worth Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, furnished tha

following information:

The Pine Ridge, South Dakota, Indian Reservation

low rent housing project is unique and some background is

necessary to an understanding of 1t. The project originated

with an inquiry èo PRA by a Hashington, D.f., law firm

representing the indian tribe, in effect as to whether the

tribe could quallly for low rent housing financing under the

Housing Act.

They could qualify through organization of a

legally constituted housing authority and did so by forming

the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority (OSHA).

Development plans vere submitted to PHA which were

based on sone dwelling units constructed on the Reservation

about a year before on contracts let by the Bureau of Indian

Affairs.

These dvellings were similar to the type of

dwellings which are constzuctedrormally as low rent housing

under PHA financing.. However, the cost of these units were,

as BROWN recalled, about $24,000 each whereas the Pla coula

not finance units costing more than about $12,000 or $13,000

under the statutory limitations. The PhA could not approve

the development at the cost proposed, but decided to look

into the matter to determine why the costs were so high.

This

was done and it was found that the general contractors'

bids were high primarily because of high labor costs occasioned

by bringing in labor from considerable distances.. They had

employed little, if any, Indian labor.

A plan was developed whereby the OSHA would direct

the construction Ltsell, that 1s, itselt periorm the

¿unction of general contractor.

Under the plan, the labor

force was to consist of Indians working as apprentices

under either Indian or non-indian journeymen, whichever

were available.

This plan had the dual benefit of providing

employment to the Indians, who were 65 per cent unemployed,

and developing them into skilled workmen. Project plans

were developed envisioning the aforementioned method oi

of operation, estimated costs were within statutory limits

and the development plans vere approved by pha.

The type of operation decided upon is termed force

account operation.

The Pine Ridge project is unique because

it is the first and only project constructed on a force account

basis.

All other projects have been, and are constructed

by general contractors on contracts let by the local

nousing authority. Therefore, this vas an entirely different

procedure for which PHA had only very broad guide lines.

CHARLES HEINZILIAN, a traveling construction repre-

sentative working under BROWN's supervision, and who resides

In Minneapolis, minnesota, was assigned to the Pine Ridge

project.

Under normal circumstances, a traveling construction

representative visits each project assigned to him once

each month for about two days jor the purpose of determining

that the local housing authority is doing what it should

be doing, that is conducting adequate and proper inspections,

ete.

However,

because of the unusual circumstances involved

in the Pine Fidge project, namely, the force account operation

and

the almost total unfamiliarity or the OSHA members with

construction, procedures, etc., it was necessary for HEINTZELMAN

to devote almost full time to the project initially. He

spent two to three weeks per month at Pine Ridge

"until he

got the ball rolling." The time required dropped gradually

so that at present FEINTZELVAN spends about one week per

month at this project.

When Project Number 2 is completed,

it is anticipated that it will only be necessary to visit

this project on the same basis other projects are visited.

HEINTZELMAN's function and duties throughout the

Pine Ridge project have been to act as a guide, counselor,

and advisor on construction. He has no authority to

award contracts, etc. all operating and cunstruction autho-

rity is within the jurisdiction of the OSHA Board.

HOwEver,

the OSHA Board has undoubtedly followed HEINTZELMAN's recommen-

dations, and he has for all practical purposes supervised

the construction.

There is no review of bids, etc. other than by

OSHA personnel and/or HEINTZELMAN. OSHA is the legal owner

of the materials, etc, and would have authority to dispose

of materials not needed.

PHA would not have any record

of such transactions.

HH 55293 DocId:32989685 Page 566

CG . 46-3873

BROWN commented that he is certain that the OSHA

has complete records because he cautioned FEINTZELMAN from

the start that he should insure that there is widely circulated

and competitive bidding on everything, and that complete

records are

maintained "down to every

nail used" on the project.

BROWN mentioned personnel problems encountered by

OSHA on the project

OsHa initially employed & construction

superintendent at $10,000 per year who was dismissed at

about the 75 per cent completion state of Project Nunber 1

for failure to periorn his job. The architect on Project

Number 1 lailed to do his job during construction and was

di snissed

by OSHA when this project was about 25 per cent

completed.

The architect who had designed Project Number 2

quit when

that project was at about the 25 per cent completion

stage because of disagreement regarding design changes.

EVAN LUCAS, the architect on Project Number 3, was engaged

Dy Dus to

take over on Project Number 2 in addition to his

employment on Project Number 3. BROWS said thai as a result

of these personnel problems, the OSHA Board undoubtedly

depended more on FEINTZELNAN than they might have otherwise.

He also pointed out that the architect is charged with the

responsibility of compliance inspection.

There were no detailed inspections of the Pine

Ridge project buildings by PHA personnel other than HEINZELMAN.

There were visits to the project by PhA officials who

observed the work and made, in effect, a general inspection.

These officials included PHA Commissioner MARIE MC GUIRE,

Chicago Regional Director WILLIAN E. BERGORON, BROWN and

BROWN reiterated that the Pine Ridge project is one

in which there is unusual and special interest because it

is the first on an Indian reservation and the first on

which the force account operation has

been used.

Further,

when the project vas being originated, the White House

expressed an interest in it.

BROWN commented that HEINTZELNAN attributes the

allegations of irregularities to two disgruntled individuals

on the reservation, namely, BREWER, who was Executive Director

of the OsHA initially, and

a friend of BREWER named HOBART

KEITH. BREWER was dismissed

as Exocutive Director by the

HH 55293 DocId:32989685 Page 567

---

## Page 568

CG 46-3873

OSLA Board on HEINTZELMAN'S recommendation as he failed to

perforn his duties properly, if at all. KEITH was described

as a disgruntled office seeker who ran for some office in

a tribal election, was defeated, and blames FEINTZELNAN fOr

his defeat despite the fact that HEINTZELNAN had nothing to

do with the election.

The financial records of OSHA were set up by

LOUIS ELLISON, an auditor of the Chicago Regional Office,

who has maintained almost continuous contact with the

project record keeping, again an abnormal situation because

of the unusual nature of this project. aLLISON has never

become aware of any irregularities.

BROWN said he has no knowledge of any irregularities

by REINTZELMAN or anyone else, and considers any allegations

of irregularities by HEINTZELMAN completely unfounded.

He described HEINIZELMAN as an extremely conscientious and

dedicated employee of the highest integrity.

He said

HEINTZELMAN has done an outstanding job on the Pine Ridge

project and received a Superior Achievement Award in connection

therewith which was presented to him by PrA commissioner sarle

MC GUIRE in Washington, D.l., at a ceremony attendea by che

press. Furthermore, BROWN said PHA is proud of the Pine

Ridge

project, the dwellings have been constructed at a cost

lower than usual, for example, the cost of Project Number 2

will run twenty per cent under the architect's estimate and

far below bids by geueral contractors on this project; employ-

ment has been, and is being afforded Indians; many have

learned a trade, and there is now an experienced construction

force on

the reservation.

BROWN further commented that general contractors

in the area, at the encouragement and solicitation of the

Builders' Exchange in Rapid City, South Dakota, raised a large

hew and cry when they learned the Pine Ridge project was to

be constructed on a force account basis. These contractors

complained to Congressmen and Senators that this was un-American,

socialistic, etc. As a result, PHA has had to answer

numerous inquiries from Congressmen and Senators. However,

all of the accusations made related to the fact the construction

was done by the Indians rather than on contract, and there

have been no allegations of irregularities.

He remarked

that because of the protest, PHA had OSHA solicited bids

for construction of Project Number 2 and the result was

that the bids received were

much too high so it was

decided to continue with the force account operation

both on Projects Number 2 and Number 3.

it did have the right to dispose of the property, with

no restrictions. murIzEL exhibited housing Authority

ALAN L. WURTZEL contacted Special Agent JOIN E. MC CARTY

and advised he is with the law firm of strasser, Spiegelberg,

Fried, Frank, and Kampelman of Washington, D. C. which firm

represents the Oglala Sioux Tribe,

and the various agencies of

that tribe, including the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority.

Mr. WURTZEL advised he had helped to draw up the contracts

involved in setting up the Housing Authority, and in obtaining

Public Housing Administration assistance in building homes on

the Pine Ridge Reservation.

He stated the Housing Authority had on one occasion

requested his legal opinion as to whether it could sell materials

from the project to local Indians at cost,

to aid them in repairing,

improving, or adding to their homes. He stated it is his opinion

that under the Annual Contributions Contract, Section 308, the

Housing Authority does have this right, and

he so informed the

Authority.

It was his understanding at that time that the

Eousing Authority had been selling such materials, and that it

was just checking with him for a legal opinion.

He pointed

out

there were no cestrictions on the sales, and while there may

have been poor administrative practices

followed in selling and

collecting for the materials, he is quite sure there is nothing

more serious than this involved.

Mr. HURTZEL said the architectural firms of Evans

Lucas and Craig and Brooks were dismissed by the Housing Authority,

after the firms had failed to meet the requirements of their

contracts, such as regular inspection of the project. Also the

firms recommended costly materials which were completely out

of line with the type of project planned and the lunds available.

He stated the Public Housing Administration stated

it would not put anything further into the project unless a change

was made in the Executive Director, then VINCENT BREWER. This

was because BREWER was very weak in office procedures.

As a

result an effort was made to have someone work with BREWER.

BREFER became quite upset and quit his job.

He said he knows

BREWER has been quite bitter towards the Public Housing Adminis-

tration, the local Housing Authority, and he himself because

of this.

WURTZEL said Public Housing Acministration auditors

regularly inspect and review the contracts let on the er dectived.

and to date have had no indication of any irregularities

He advised he knows the local Authority did delegate

Mr. HEINTZELMAN the authority to let bids and in general to

build the project. He said he also knows HCINTZELMAN frequently

did discuss proposed changes of any significance with the Authority

members.

He pointed out there has been some dissension about

the project from labor unions and contractors as it is a "Force

Account" project.

However, he said, the project is being completed

with substantially less money than originally planned on.

Mr. WURTZEL stated that from his own knowledge, and

information he has received, he knoWs HEINTZELMAN has used

materials in the project which are equal to or better than those

called for in the specifications.

He said it appears to him that HEINTZELMAN has done

a very good job under very trying circumstances, and that while

there may be cause for complaint as to office or administrative

procedures and laxity he can not see where there is anything more

serious involved.

He pointed out his interest is in protecting

the tribal interests, and in his opinion the tribe, and the

government, have not suffered any loss in any way.

ALAN L. WURTZEL requested Special Agant JOHN I. MC CARTY

Mr. WURTZEL advised records of the office reflect the

bids submitted by the Rushville Lumber Company were submitted

within the specified time.

There is nothing in the bids requiring

they be opened'at a specified time or date.

He pointed out that

on dimension lumber on SD 1-3, the Rushville Lumber Company

received the bid, being $200 under the next bidder.

On nails

the Company was

in about the midale of bids submitted, and

did not get the bid.

On concrete blocks it was the lowest of

four bidders,

On roofing materials the

However, the lowest bidder would only deliver in carload

1015,

and would not guarantee the price over six months.

Because

Rushville Lumber guaranteed the price,

and would deliver in quan-

tities desired, the contract was awarded to it. On window wells

it was the second highest out of four bidders, and did not get

the contract.

On chimney flues it was the only bidder of four

companies contacted, and hence got the bid.

On flooring it was

in the middle of three

bidders, and did not get the contract.

HT: HURTZEL exhibited a list of changes, and advised

this list to November 15, 1963 lists each change made in SD 1-2.

These

changes were discussed by CHARLES HEINTZELMAN with his

superior in the Public Housing Administration Office in Chicago,

with the architect, and, it major changes, were discussed with

the Local Authority members, before the changes were made.

said he has personally heard HCINIZELMAN discuss many changes

and proposed

or the Authority as a whole at its meetings.

In connection with his job he is required to try to

get rid of slum areas in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. The only

way he can do this is to have local

people remodel and renovate

their homes, or build new ones. He felt they could do this

themselves, if they could obtain materials at cost.

He then went to the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority

to tho

early in the spring of 1963. At that time he made the suggestion

to the Housing Authority that it sell materials at cost to

local people to use in fixing up or building their homes.

As he recalls no action was taken on his request in

his presence, and he does not know if any action was ever taken

or not on it.

He is on the Board of the Old Age Home, SD I-2, and has

obtained about fifty used and discarded blocks from the Housing

"previous to my termination, Mr. Keith, one of the

Housing Board members, asked me if I had first knowledge of

Mr. Richard Wilson, plumbing supervisor and husband of the

current executive Director, being drunk on the job for several

days, and leaving the job for considerable lengths of time,

making trips to neighboring towns to obtain more booze. I

said I had observed this and he asked me to give him a

Stockman's National Bank of Rushville, Nebraska through Mr.

Albert Dale, President of the bank and a member of the Oglala

Sioux Housing Authority Board. On pay day, my Housing Authority

check was retained by Mr. Dale, I did not sign it, or even see

It, but would received a check from the bank for my wages fron

which had been deducted the payment on my loan,

and the Housing

Authority check stub.

It is my observation that all or practically

all of the workmen borrowed money from the bank through Mr. Dale

at various times.

It is my opinion that the status of these

loans influenced the retention on the job.

"The afor mentioned Mr. Richard Wilson, who was

plumbing supervisor for the Housing Authority and whose wife:

is Executive Director, gave myself and karl leon Jr. a saturday

and sunday job to build a plunbing shop for him, which te

"proceeded to do.

Mr. Nilson instructed us that we should

take the material from the elderly housing job and this had

been cleared with Mr. Heintzelman. He, therefore, took the

building blocks, etcetra from the elderly job, and used them

on Mr. Wilson's plumbing shop. We naturally thought this

was all right,

in as much

Hr. Wilson's wife is Executive

Director.

Mr. Wilson agreed to pay us 15¢ a block. He had

a very difficult time getting our money from Mr. Wilson, and

of course he is the same party that me signed the statement

about,

that made Mr. Heintzelman mad at me and refuse to to

re-employ me.

"On the elderly home,

when the block work was com-

pleted, I was switched to metal lathing, and put in all the

lath in 22 bathrooms.

When this was completed, I applied

for the plastering and tile setting work, but was told that

this work was contracted.

I went to the office and asked if

It was contracted, was told that it was, but they would not

let me see the contract without a court order.

The Housing

Authority requested two tile setters from the

Employment

Oilice, and

the employment Office gave me a card for one of

these jobs, but when I took it to the man in charge of the

tile setting, he refused to accept me, saying it would cut him

out of work.

"There are a great many rumors about Oglala Sioux

Housing material being

used on private work by those who

are "on the in" with r. Heintzelman.

The electrician,

for example, concurrently with his work on the elderly housing,

wired the hormon Church and a private home near White Clay,

Nebraska.

It is commonly understood that the material for

contract for $1, 500.00 which he had for plumbing on a private

State of South Dakota being first duly sworn upon oath de-

poses and says that:

"I, Bernard LeBeau was employed as Carpenter Fore-

man for the Oglala Sioux Housing Construction from June 1963

to November 1963 at which time I was injured and spent a

month in the hospital.

I returned to work as a carpenter

February 1964 and have been laid off several times from that

date until now.

During my employment on several occasions, I

obtained a loan from Stockman's National Bank, Rushville,

Nebraska thru Mr. Albert Dale who is Bank President and also

Treasurer of the Oglala Sioux Housing Authority. During the

period when I owed the bank, I would not receive my pay check

from the Housing Authority, would not see it and of course

not sign it.

It would be cashed by Mr. Ble and I would re-

ceive a check stub from the bank and the banks check for the

balance.

When the final payment was made,

Twould receive

the check stub,

the banks check for the balance of my wages

and the note which I had signed.

It is my observation that

all or practically all workmen on the housing project at

times,

had loans from Mr. Dale's bank. It is my opinion

that the status of your employment and retention of employ-

ment was influenced by the status of these loans.

At the time

I was injured and entered the hospital November 1963, I owed

approximately $400.00 t the bank on a note. After my return

to work in February of 1964, there were pay periods in which

Mr. Dale took the entire amount and I never saw my pay check

from the Housing Authority or any othor check.

When in the

hospital my wife was given $120.00 by the Housing Authority

and it was labeled "advanced payment". Mr. Hentzman at one

time stated that it came out of his own pocket,

however, it.

Dale took this payment out of my check in addition to his

bank payment and as soon as I finished paying both of these

debts, I was immediately terminated.

It is yell known I am

a qualified skilled carpenter, capable of doing finish and trim

work in addition to all other

phases of the trade.

"all, and I was told the time was not turned in. One week

it involved one day's pay and the other week it involved a

day and a half.

"There are many things I do not understand about

the practices of the Housing Authority. For example, about

July 1963, I, with three other workmen, was sent to build

an addition on a privately built home.

The material used

was from the Housing Authority stock pile and I was paid

along with the others by the Housing Authority. I was in-

structed to do this by ar. Tyler,

Superintendent and in

another instance, an adaltion was built by housing authority

personnel and material on orders of Mr. Tyler, and I under-

stand fir. Tyler instructed the man it would cost $1,000.00.

I worked on this job and was paid for my labor with a Housing
