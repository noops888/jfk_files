surveillances are expensive in that they cause the tying up of manpower and

should not be resorted to unless results can reasonably be expected.

In surveillances in cases of major importance SACs should assume personal,

on-the-scene supervision and not delegate such command to subordinates.

Il a sufficient reason exists to prevent the SAC iron being personally

SAC must assure himself that all physical surveillances comply with

Bureau instructions, and are being given adequate supervison.

FBI employees other

vithout specifio Bureau authority.

Provide Agents with explicit instructions on each physical surveillance

in which they engage.

Agent personnel participating on physical surveillances

should be orally advised concerning the duties to be performed in

connection with such surveillances and should not be permitted to carry

with them any writton surveillance schedules.

If it is necossary to utilize

code words for commun: cations over Bureau radios, the approved list of

code words if too long to be remembered may be furnished to the Agent

driving the car but should not be removed from the car during the course

of the surveillance.

When the surveillance has been concluded,

the list

words should be returned to the supervisor in charge of

surveillance.

All written data of any kind relating to physical surveillances must be

turned in by the Agents preparing or

at the conclusion of each day's tour at duty.

In some instances

Agents will complete their tour of duty on physical surveillances outside

their headquarters city, and in those cases it will not be possible for

However, in such situations,

the Agents will be hold personally

•C. REASONS FOR CONDUCTING SURVEILLANCES

The purpose of the surveillance is an important factor to keep in mind

at all

times, and the Agents assigned to surveillances must know

the purpose

in order to function efficiently.

The Bureau surveillances usually have

for their purpose one or more of

the following:

1.

The location of fugitives through the

surveillance of relatives or

known contacts

2. Surveillances conducted to cover pay-offs in extortion cases

3.

Surveillance of subjects or suspects

in espionage,

sabotage,

or other

national defense

cases to observe their activities and ascertain the

identity of their accomplices

4. Surveillances conducted

at the request of other governmental departments

D.

TYPES OF SURVEILLANCES

1.

Fixed surveillances

These

are surveillances often referred to as plants, where

the Agents

are stationed in one location and usually involve the surveillance of

a place to determine the activities and

the identity of persons going

in and oui of the premises under surveillance.

2:

Mobile surveillances

This is a moving surveillance where

the Agents are moving about on foot,

by automobile or on trains, airplanes,

or other means of

surveilling subjects or suspects

E. SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT

The equipment used on surveillances will depend upon the type and purpose of'.

The following examples illustrate some of the uses of

technical and other equipment on Bureau surveillances:

1.

Firearms, restraining devices,

and lighting equipment on fugitive

2. Surveillances in extortion cases often require a great variety of equip

ment, including radio,

decoy packages,

signaling devices, binoculars,

lighting equipment,

as well as firearms and restraining devices.

3. Automobiles are essential in practically all types of surveillances and

care should be taken to insure that the cars used are not conspicuous

and are speedy enough to follow the rehicles

Consideration must be given to changing automobiles

and/or. license plates.

Photographic equipment

can be used in practically all types of surveil

Although cash is not ordinarily considered as equipment, it is very

essential that the Agents on surveillances protide themselves with

URVEILLANCES AND RAIDS

ACTIVITIES OF AGENTS ON SURVEILLANCES

L.

It is of paramount importance that Agents on surveillances aot perfectly

natural at all times.

Any indications of self-consciousness or unusual

aotions or appearance of the Agents will, of course, assist the subject in

verifying any suspicions he may have that he is under surveillance.

20

Agents on surveillances must be constantly on the alert for countersurveillances

on the part of accomplices of the subject.

For example, when a surveillance

is being conducted on foot, it is desirable to have one

of the Agents walk on

the opposite

side of the street from the subject in order that he might be in

a position to observe any countersurveillance activities on the other side of

the street.

Agents on fixed surveillances must, of course, always be on the

alert for microphone plants and taps on the telephones being used by the

3 .

The use of contacts, sources of information and confidential informants

should not be overlooked by the agents on surveillances.

For example, in

the event a subject registers in a hotel, considerable information can be

obtained

among the employees and management of the hotel if informants have

been developed among them.

4.

Agents on surveillances should constantly keep in touch with thelsupervisor

(SAC in cases of major importance) lin order that he might be continually

informed of the developments in the case.

It is extremely important that

Agents immediately communicate with thel supervisor (or SAC) ]when the surveil-

lance is lost by one particular Agent in order that this Agent might be able

to catch up with the surveillance again the next time the Agents who

following the subject call in.

The importance of the coordination of the

Agents working on the surveillance with the [supervisorlby means of telephone

and in some instances radio,

cannot be over-emphasized, and in order that

this might be

effective, it is necessary for the Agents working on the surveil

lance to be in communication with the[ supervisorlas frequently as this can be

done without

attracting attention.

RENTING OF PREMISES FOR USE IN FIXED SURVEILLANCES

1.

Fixed surveillances from automobiles parked on the street are usually good

for only a few hours due to the laot that the cars become conspicuous

2. Prior to renting quarters, care must be taken to first ascertain the

reliability of the owner of the property by a discreet inquiry.

situation which might be even more embarrassing than the truth.

such use

of pretext requires careful

thought and planning.

In many instances the

Agent must disclose his official identity

in order to obtain suitable

quarters for the surveillance; however,

such instances, the intimate

details of the surveillance and the

case under investigation should never

be disclosed to the person contacted no matter how reliable he may appear

4o

When quarters are rented for a fixed surveillance, telephones should be

installed in order to enable the Agents on

surveillance to communicate with

the office and with the Agents on the outside.

The Agents on a fixed surveillance should use extreme

caution to prevent

fire hazards.

Their personal habits and conduct should be such that there:

will be no rause for complaint from neighbors or those from whom the

property is rented.

The arrival

and departure of Agents assigned to the surveillance should be

arranged at a time when there will be the least possibility of arousing

suspicion on the part of subject or other persons in the building.

countersurveillances on the part of subject or his accomplices.

All Bureau property taken to the place of a fixed surveillance must be

completely inventoried.

This action should be done before the property is

moved into the quarters to be occupied.

or

when the surveillance

is

abandoned, the property removed must be checked

off the inventory.

With the abandonment of such a surveillance, a thorough

and detailed search of the premises must be made to prevent the

the tracing of such property.

and the details of the location and the surrounding terrain explained to

the Agents by blaciboard diagrams

or other illustrative methods.

2.

In other types of surveillances, certain problems arise again and again

which can and should be planned in advance.

For example, the problem of

taking over a surveillance at a railroad station comes up very frequently

offices, and care is no reason why detailed plans cannot be

worked out in advaice

and discussed at Agent conterences so that all the

Agents in the office will know the details of such plans.

the reasons for the inability of the above-naned oîficial's participation.

Ivery raid should be carefully planned in advance to insure the greatest

prevent the escape of the persons sought.

One individual designated as a raid commander should be responsible for

planning and conducting of the raid, and it is his responsibility to see

that all members of the raiding party are aware of the parts they are to

take in the raid and he alone should be charged with the duty of changing

plans and issuing orders as the situation may demand.

e.

The equipment to be used will be determined by the raid commander and

will depend upon the circumstances of

each particular case.

Obviously

higb-powered rifles cannot be used in congested areas and

firearms used will conform with the location of the plaoe to be raided

and the proximity of neighboring houses and buildings.

All the equip

ment, including firearms, handouffs, leg irons, electrical and technical

equipment, should be inspected by the raid commander or an

designated Special Agent prior to the raid.

experienced

Agents shoulá be partic-

ularly alert to display suitably their identification, either by means

of arm bands or badges, especially at all times when

they are moving

about in the possession of exposed firearms.

Consideration should be

given to using arm bands and pass words to identify Agents on the raids

and. Agents should display badges prominently on the outside of their

coats.

Of course, all automobiles used in the raid must be filled

with gasoline and oil and be in perfect running condition.

[Each office is to maintain a supply of arm bands

to provide 50% of the Agent personnel with them a surricient quantity

An assembly point should be designated near the place which is to be

raided where all Agents can assemble just before the raid for final

instructions prior to proceeding to their positions.. In the event the

place to be raided is near the field office, it would not be necessary,

but where the objective to be raided is some distance away,

an assembly

Of course, the assembly point must be sufficiently

far from the scene of the raid to preclude the possibility of the sub

jects' being warned of the proposed raid by this assembling of Agents.

be selected which will prevent concentrating the personnel in

and public places.

The Agents should not arrive in a group but

singly or in pairs and avoid attracting attention to their movements.

When carrying firearms,

such as machine guns or shotguns, the departure

from the Burcan headquarters or wherever

a temporary headquarters may

be located should be by rear or side entrance and such movement should

• not be a group departure which will give the appearance a mass raid

is about to take place.

IPPROACH TO THE PLACE TO BE RAIDED

The exact manner in which raiding Agents and cover Agents should approach

the place to be raided depends upon the type of place raided and the

surrounding territory,

In any event the approach should be made in such

a manner as not to warn the occupants of the raid objective before all

of the Agents are in their proper positions. This may involve in some

cases leaving automobiles at a distance and approaching the place to be

raided on foot.

When automobiles are so left,

they should be securely

locked and in many instances it may well be part of the raid plan

these cars used for the purpose of blocking roads and other exits from the

place to be raided. When it is necessary to use a large number of auto-

mobiles to conduci a raid, these cars

should not proceed from the Bureau

office or garage in a caravan and should not collect at any given point

near the place to be raided at any appreciable length of time prior to

the time the raid is to be conducted.

Large numbers of similar cars

closely following each other during unusual hours

will attract attention,

resulting in reports to the local police.

Rather than, this,

the Agents

should be required to set their watches before leaving the

office and

be instructed to proceed over different routes,

meeting at a given point

at a given time immediately prior to the time the raid is to be conducted.

Care should be taken to make as little noise as possible.

The slamming

of automobile doors should be particularly guarded against.

Prior to giving the signal for the beginning of the raid,

the raid commander

should know definitely that all of the men are in position and have had

an opportunity to make use of whatever natural cover is available.

P.

ENTERING THE PLACK TO BE RAIDED

1.

Raids may begin by a signal from the raid commander to the occupants of

the place being raided, advising

them of the official identity of the

raiding party and requesting their surrender.

Sometimes this can be

accomplished by a telephone call and in other instances it will be necessary

- to shout to the occupants of the house from the outside, attract attention.

by blowing a whistle

or some similar method.

Many raids of premises,

however, are begun by the

raid commander, after providing for appropriate

outside protection of the premises, approaching the front entrance and

demanding entry after making his presence and official capacity known.

2.

Both

the raiding Agents and the covering Agents must utilize all natural

covering available during the approach to the place to be raided and during

the raid.

Cover not only protects the Agents from hostile gunfire but also

conceals

their movements and whereabouts so that they cannot be observed by

the occupants of the house or placo being raided.

3.

It the subjects in the house being raided do not

surrender and are known

to be dangerous and desperate characters, tear gas should be utilized to

force them out of the premises.

When this is done,

the raiding Agents

will have to wear a gas mask when entering the building after the raid is

over. Iven though subjects emerge from the house after the gas is used,

Agonts entering the house thereafter

should use extreme caution to guard

against surprise attack by others hiding in the house whose presence was

not contemplated.

-.4.

In any raid the participants should clearly identify themselves as Special

Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to all persons in the place

being raided and those nearby so that no claim can be made by subjects thai

When persons are seen emerging from the house, they should be advised of the

If, however, they come out

3. It is the duty of covering Agents to guard against possible attack by con-

roderates of

the occupants of the raided house who may come up from the rear

oither to assist the subjects in the house or possibly due to the fact that

they are unaware that the raid is in progress.

The covering Agents must also

guard against the possibilities of accomplices residing in adjacent houses

It should be realized that raid commanders assign sufficient personnel

ACTION TO BE TAKEN AFTER THE RAID

2.

All persons apprehended during a raid should be taken under proper guard

to the place where they are to be detained.

3:

Where the possibility exists of other members of the subject's gang coming

to the

house that has been raided, a sufficient number of Agents properly

armed should be left in the house

or apartment.

These Agents must conduct

themselves in such a manner as to not arouse

suspicion and warn confederates

of the apprehended persons that the former occupants are no longer there.

4.

111 raids should be conducted

as secretly as possible and without resulting

in undue publicity.

The names of participants in a raid should not be

disclosed without prior Bureau authority.

Should anyone be killed during

a raid and inquest by local authorities is necessary, arrangements can

usually be made for one or two Agents to testify for

the entire raiding party.

5. ' Agents on a raid should never indulge in promiscuous shooting and should

constantly bear in mind the Bureau's rule that Agents should shoot only in

self-defense.

The point selected should be located where natural cover is

afforded for the Agents engaged in this work, such as where a roadbed

Consideration should be given to locating the point of

To block a road and stop a specific automobile can be done by selecting

a point in

the road which is relatively narrow and extending a rope or

cable across the road with a stop sign attached to the center.

One end:

of the rope or cable can be fastened

to a tree or some other similar

object on one side of the road and the rope then laid flat across the

road

and

the other end wrapped around à tree or pole in such a manner

as

will

permit the rope. to

be pulled taut across the road and

securely

fastened.

Agents can be stationed under cover to pull up the rope or

cable when the wanted car approaches. Other cars will not be stopped

and can easily drive across the rope

or cable as it lies on the road.

This cable or rope should be placed across the road diagonally so

if the wanted car is driven into the obstruction it will be deflected

sideways to the side of the road into a ditch or an embankment.

Agents should be stationed at a considerable point up the road in the

direction from which the car is expected to appear, and these Agents

have the duty of watching for the wanted car and notifying the Agents

at the barricade of its approach and also of blocking the escape of

the car if it turns around

and tries to go back.

If the wanted car

approaches the barricade and stops, Agents, properly armed, located

under cover on one side of the road

should train their guns on the car

and commmand the occupants to alight.

Roads can be blocked with automobiles

in those cases where a car is

expected to proceed along a certain road on which there is considerable

traffic and where it is not feasible to use either of the above methods.

This roadblock can be established by baving Agents in one car stationed

beside the highway at an intersection or in a filling station,

• be on the lookout for the wanted automobile.

Agents should be stationed

at a point at a considerable distance down

the road but within view of the first car so that signals may be ex-

changed.

When the wanted car approaches,

the first car will signal

to the Agents in the other cars who will drive their cars across the

road in such à manner as to completely block the road and force the

oncoming car to stop or

No Agents, of course, should re-

main inside the car which is used as a barricade:

around and attempts to turn back, the Agents in the first car can use

their car to block the road.

In general, the type of barricade used will depend upon the type of

highway, the amount of traffic on it, the surrounding terrain,

character of the

persons sought, and the time available.

Blockades

should be established at a point where the road is narrow if this is

at all possible.

The point selected should be between deep ditches,

high embankments, or heavy woods to prevent the wanted persons irom

driving around the barricade through open fields.

Agents covering this

point should all be placed on the same side of the road so that they

will not injure one another by cross fire.

If it becomes necessary to approach a car

which has been stopped at a

barricade, you should take advantage of the cover provided by the car

itself in approaching it.

This should be done, of course, in such a

manner as to place the occupant of the car at a disadvantage in your

approach to him to effect an apprehension or require him to get out

of the car in question.

Whenever a roadblock is established in which any Bureau personnel is

physically present and participates, it is

fundamental that

be in charge of such operation and they must make sure that the police

or any others participating furnish full cooperation.

Each SAC will be

held personally responsible to see that any such roadblock is complete

and no excuse will be accepted for any such operation which proves to

•be ineffective.

In planning a roadblock, definite consideration must

be given to providing for

the safety of the officers participating and

• innocent citizens who can logically be expected

to run into such a

roadblock on the public highway.

BACKGROUND

The protection

highest

importance to our system

of free enterprise

and democratic government.

During the yast docade there have been a constant:

increasing awareness and

interest in this problem by individual citizens,

various organized groups, and by branches of the Federal, state, and local

governments.

The highly controversial subjects of race relations and of

"States Rights" versus Federal action f'equently complicate civil rights

matters.

together with

the public interest in these, cases,

frequently places the Bureau's investigations in the spotlight andon occasic

is responsible for uninformed comment on these investigations by interasted

In view of the above, it is particularly important that the Bureau's usual

thorough, expeditious,

and strictly impartial methods be carefully followed

investigations and that the Bureau policy hereinafter set

strictly observed.

Section 242 punishes any person acting willlully and under color of law

to deprive any inhabitant of lederally secured rights.

The gist of this

is the intentional misuse of the power of public office. The

rights subject to deprivation by persons invested with such power run

the

gamut of all rights guaranteed by the Constitution, such as the right to

due process and equal protection, the right to be iroe irom unlawíul

soarch, arrest, and detention, and the right to be free from summary

punishment.

Also included are those rights protected by the laws of the

U.S.

as interpreted by the courts and

specifically those rights sot

forth in

Title 18,

88 241, 242, and 245; Title 42, § 1973; and the Civil

E. INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDU

A prelininary investigation normally covers all of the below-listed procedures.

A limited investigation normally covers all of the below listed procedures

with the exception the subjects are not interviewed unless they voluntarily

desire to furnish information.

1.

Thoroughly interview complainant and/or victim obtaining complete data,

including names and addresses of subjects, additional victims, and poten-

tial witnesses.

2.

Ascertain reliability and background of the complainant, victim, and/or

subject.

30

Identify subjects and, if possible, suspects and interview them. If any

reason exists for not

interviewing

subject, set forth reason in report.

If the subject, be he a police officer or otherwise, requests the inter-

view be conducted in the presence of his superior or any other single rep-

resentative of his choosing, the interview may be conducted provided

approval of the SAC has been obtained.

The interviewing Agents should

insure they do not volunteer the information they will conduct the inter-

view of the subject under such conditions prior to making efforts to conduct

an unrestricted interview. Any difficulty experienced in connection with

interview of a subject law enforcement officer must be brought to the atten-

tion of the Bureau immediately. If a Chief of Police or acting head of

such department declines or indicates a reluctance to make a police officer

available for interview, you should nevertheless advise such official that

it will be necessary to personally contact each police officer involved for

a personal expression of his desires.

Your office must then contact each

officer personally and ascertain whether or not he desires to be interviewed.

4.

Interview not only

available pertinent witnesses but all known eyewitnesses

to the incident.

50

Check jail and

court records when victim has been arrested. If the com-

plaint relates to a federally protected activity, determine what complaints

have been made to local authorities regarding the act of interference and

what, if any, action is contemplated or has been taken.

6.

Check hospital records and interview doctors if victim

hospital attention and also identify and interview all persons present when

victim received medical attention as well as the persons who transported

or accompanied victim to the hospital or doctor. LIf victim required

medical treatnent and if warranted, have victim execute FD-465 (Authority

to Release Medical Information), if he appears legally competent.

7.

under age, FD-465 should be executed by parent or legal guardian.]

Take appropriate color and black and white photographs of complained-of

injuries or damage to property if possible and locate and preserve any

physical evidence.

8. After completion of investigation, unless Bureau instructs otherwise, USA

should be contacted for his views

as to merits of particular case and

whether of not further investigation is desired. If he suggests further

investigation, a report should be submitted showing information developed

and views of USA.

Advise Bureau by wire or airtel, depending on urgency.

of specific investigation requested, and

conduct investigation unless infor-

mation known to your office indicates request should be referred to Depart-

ment before proceeding. USA is not to be advised of your action in this

regard.

If USA is unable or unwilling to furnish his views at time of initial con-

tact, he should be followed on a day-to-day basis until such is obtained.

If USA indicates he desires to furnish his views directly to Department or

views will

not be forthcoming promptly, set forth this in report with state-

ment to effect that in light of comments of USA; this matter will no longer

be followed with USA for his determination unless specifically requested

by Department.

Report should not be delayed to report additional inves

tigation but a supplemental report submitted. USA cannot decline prosecu

tion inasmuch as final determination of prosecution rests with Civil Rights

Division of Department.

Consequently, no arrests are to be made or com-

plaints filed without Bureau authority.

exist why they cannot be interviewed.

The same requirements hold true for

complainants, known eyewitnesses, doctors who have

nt is believed to have been

summated.

Procure all evidence possible fron which a jury roud forn

the natural

conclusion that the subjects mutually agreed, planned, acquiesced in,

or intended to carry out the object of their

agreement.

Be on the alert for direct evidence of the agreement,

such as letters

documenis, formal coutracts, memoranda, or other rapers.

Ascertain what

vechal siatements, admissions, or confessions sach or any of the sub-

jects may have made from which the agreements or conspiracy may be

indicated.

Obtain evidence o1 the acis or transactions, statements,

or communications of subjects that mould indicate the existence of a

mutual plan and purpose.

Bear in mind that while

it is not necessary to prove the existence of

agreement in the nature of a contract it still is necessary

to prove thai two or more persons had a meeting

of the minds in the per

fection of a plan haring as its object the violation of any lair of ine

U.S. or committing any fraud against the U.S. in order to fulfill

requirements of element l; that is,

the existence of an agreement.

It will be belpful in the investigation of this type of case it the

Agent considers the completed crime of conspiracy to consist os, first,

the agreement, and then the commission of one or more actual orert zois

in the furtherance of the original plan.

With regard to proving overt

acts, the Agent should obtain evidence as to each aot or transaction

engaged in by one or more of the subjects for the

purpose of carrying

out the original agreement.

This necessitates not only establishing

the dates and places but also circumstantial evidence that the act in

question furthers the conspiracy.

Any physical act on the part of

one or more of the

conspirators consti-

tutes an overt act in the fulfillment of element 22.

If two individnals

conspired to rob a national bank and one of them purchased an automobile

as a getariay car, the purchase of

the automobile would be an overt act

which, added to a previously proved agreement to sob the bank, would

complete the crime of conspiracy.

Bear in mind that where evidence

of the agreement is vague intensive

investigation of all overt acts frequently leads

to evidence proving

the agreement.

Therefore, in the case of the autonobile, if it was devel

oped one of the subjects-mentioned to the automobile salesman thai le

and a friend planned to use the automobile as a getaway car,

evidence would tend to prove both the overt act of purchasing the auto

mobile and the agreement.

Seizure powers

8. Department has

sed that the dominant purpos

seizure powers under

section 401 is

to

accomplish forfeiture of arms

and munitions of war

which have been the subject of attemoted exportation in violation of

1aH.

Bureau may make seizures under section 401 only in those instances

during Investigations of violations of neutrality statutes in which

It develogs that arms will be illegally exported,

the seizures must

be made to prevent the illegal exportation,

and arrests are not to be

made.

It is mandatory, of

course,

that probable cause exists to

believe that the material is about to

be illegally exported. If

arrests are to be made, seizures must be made incidental to lawful

arrest or on basis

of

a search warrant and not under section 401.

b.

Prior

to making any seizure under

section 401, Bureau authority must

be obtained whereter possible, using whatever

means of communication

warranted under the circumstances.

SAC may authorize seizure under

section 401 only in those instances in which time is of essence and

does not permit prior communication with Bureau.

Material seized under section 401 is to be disposed of under provisions

of Title 19, USC, $ 1602.

The material should be delivered to the

local collector of Customs and

he should be furnished the information

as required by Title 19, USC, & 1603.

Briefly, FBI is to furnish

collector of Customs a detailed account of the

seizure including a

statement of all the facts

and circumstances

of the case

within the

citation of

Bureau's knowledde, with the names of ve been seated, and on whion

I COUNSELING EVASION OF ACT OR REGULATIONS; HINDERING OR INTERFERING

Organized opposition to act

A number of organizations and persons are actively engaged in formulating,

promoting, and organizing opposition to act.

Such opposition may assume

various forms, such as efforts directed toward repeal of

act, encouraging

registrants to avail themselves of grounds for deferment or exemption pro-

vided by or under act, and counseling noncompliance with act through

refusal or evasion of registration,

service, or other duties imposed by

act or regulations.

Activities of these organizations may come in conilict

with either or both of two penal provisions of section 12(a of Title I

of act, which prohibits counseling

evasion or refusal of any of

provisions of Title I, as well as hindering or interfering with administra-

tion of this title,

and may also constitute violations of

peacetime

sedition statutes.

•Violations of the two mentioned provisions of section 12(a) may occur

either because of results

sought by organization or individual opposed

to act or because of manner in which organization or individual attempts

to achieve desired ends.

Any activities which constitute counseling,

ing, or abetting of refusal or evasion of any of provisions of title I

illegal and punishable under act, regardless of the manner in which

carried on.

On the other hand, activities directed toward repeal of act

encouragement of registrants to assert rights granted to them by act

are not in violation of Iitle I unless carried on in such manner as to

constitute hindrance

or interference with administration of act.

example, it is possible persons advocating repeal and attempting to

influence others to join

them in that purpose may pickei registration

centers, local boards, eta., in such a manner as to hinder or interiere

with administration of act.

No active investigation should be conducted until authorized by Bureau.

Observation of these activities should be continued and Bureau offices

should arrange to receive information from police agencies, informants,

and similar sources.

Copies of handbills and literature should be

obtained and appropriately 'identified and preserved for possible future

Photographs of picket-line activities should be obtained, unless

failed to meet minimum mental and literacy tests, or a physical disability,

preliminary investigation should be conducted to

original

complainant should be thoroughly

interviewed and registrant's status at

and good judgment must be

N. PRESENTING CASES TO

All pertinent facts relating to reported violations of act should be

thoroughly discussed

ordinarily be sought from USA until evidence has been obtained indicating

violation is wilful, or delinquent has been located and interviewed.

Large number of registrants are found by investigation to be veterans

exempt from induction, currently serving in armed forces, or obviously

disqualified physically or mentally. Complaints filod with U.S.

Magistrates by Agents in these cases are regarded by public as formal

accusations by Bureau of serious violations of law punishable by severe

penalties.

Good judgment and common sense should be used so that reported

delinquents are not lightige moriessly thus stigmatized.

When a USA

indicates in advance.he. will decline prosecution in favor of compliance

by subject if the violation is nòt wilful and subject is willing to comply,

as to whether

violation was wilful must be made by USA and not by

Accordingly, after location and interview of a delinquent, all

pertinent facts developed must be presented to USA for a prosecutive opin-

ion before any arrangements are made to enable delinquent to bring himself

into compliance with act.

When information is obtained a subject is or may be armed and dangerous,

procoss should be obtained, if

possible, for protection of Agents in

approaching him ior questioning. Any evidence indicating wilfulness should

be furnished USA.

Possibility

such delinguents may be morally unacceptable

to armed forces because of arrest records or pending criminal proceedings

against them should also be borne in mind with view to furnishing available

information to local board, if USA has no objection, for consideration in

T. HANDLING DELINQUINIS OUTSIDE UNITED STATES

1. Registrants who left or have remained outside U. S. to evade service

There are no extradition

treaties covering selective service cases.

On 9-27-44, the President signed Public Law 431, 78th Congress,

more commonly known as "Expatriation Bill," which amended section 401

of Nationality Act of 1940 Title 8, USC,

8801) and which (1) pro-.

vides for automatic expatriation of a citizen of U.S. who departs

or remains outside of,

the country during time of war or national

emergency for purpose of avoiding or evading military service and

for same purpose (88 136(a) (1) and 801(j), Iitle 8, USC). These

sections were repealed by Public Law 414,

82nd Congress,

commonly known

as McCarran-Walter Act, and reenacted as

sections 1182(a 22) and

second to citizens.

In reenactment of this legislation, important

changes were made.

With respect to aliens, statute excepts

provisions those

nonimmigrant aliens at time of departure

to avoid service and who seek to reenter as nonimmigrants.

On 2-18-63 the U.

S. 144 (1963) held as unconstitutional

sections 801(j) and 1481(a) (10), Title 8, USC, pertaining to citizens;

thereby barring the U.S. from expatriating citizens who depart or

remain outside the

country during time of war or national emergency

for purpose of avoiding or evading military service.

It is important to note that nonimmigrant aliens

who leave to avoid

or evade training and service are thereaiter ineligible to reenter

as immigrants.

DEPARTMENTAL INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES

1.

§ 1116

Following the precedent of USC § 1114 (Protection of Officers and

Employees of the United States), the Act adds to T18 a new 8 1116

relying on the definitions and penalties in T18, USC §§ 1111 and 1112,

except that punishment of first degree is mandatory life in prison.

The term "foreign official' includes two distinct categories.

regard to the first group, such as Chiefs of State, the purpose of the

foreign official's presence in the U.S. is immaterial.

regard to the second group, that is "officials or employees of a

foreign government or international organization duly notified to the

United States," their coverage under the Act requires they be foreign

nationals and

in the U. S. on official business.

Such persons inclue

officials and employees of foreign governments at embassies, consulates,

missions and those employed at trade or commercial offices of foreign

governments.

The family of a foreign official in this second category is included, but

unlike the first category, a family member's presence in the U.S.

must be in connection with the presence in the U.S. of the related

foreign official.

Coverage does not extend to the families of official guests unless the

family members are so designated in their own right by the Secretary of

State.

20

§ 1201

•The act of kidnaping a foreign official or official guest is punishable

vithout regard to interstate transportation of the victim.

punishment was reduced to imprisonment for any term of years or permissible

life, but no statutory proof

of harm to the victim is required to suddort

any sentence which may be adjudged.

3.

$ 112.

As amended by the Act, & 112 now includes assaulting, striking, wounding,

imprisoning or offering violence to, foreign officials or official guests.

In addition to broadening the classes of persons covered, § 112 (b)

makes it a misdemeanor to willfully intimidate, coerce, threaten or

harass a foreign official or official guest or willfully obstruct a

foreign official in the performance of his duties. Protection against

the performance of their duties at the time of the violation.

Although not all-inclusive, examples of violations would be:

Following the foreign official or official guest about in a public

place alter being requested not to do so;

Engaging in a course of conduct, including the use of abusive language,

or repeatedly committing acts which alarm intimidate, or persecute the

foreign official or official guest and serve no legitimate purpose;

OI

c.

Communicating with the foreign official or official guest by anonymous

telephone calls, or otherwise, in a manner likely

to cause annoyance

or alarm with no purpose of legitimate communication.

and offices,

Note that premises of official guests are not covered

by § 112 (c).

§ 112 (c) does not apply at all to the District of Columbia wherein the

a person who parades, pickets, displays any flag, banner, sign, placard,

or harass a Toreign

official or to obstruct him in the performance of his duties.

The terms used in § 112 (c) "purpose" and "intent" require proof that

the person or persons allegedly violating this section were knowledgeable

that the person or premises against which

the alleged violation occurred

were covered under the Act.

Requirement for proof of knowledge ordinarily

would be by putting violators on notice of the provisions of the Act.

FBI INDEXING PROCEDURES

The FBE utilizes a system of maintaining its over 6, 500, 000 investigative,

personnel, and administrative files by which all information on a given subject is

channeled into one file. In order to facilitate control of the file and accommodate

multiple subject(s)'matters, a numbering system is used to'indicate: (1) general

classification and nature.of the violation; (2) the individual case file in this category;

and (3) serialization of each piece of mail in the file. For instance, the number

7-100-10 on a piece of mail indicates it is the 10th piece of mail in the 100th file

assigned in the Kidnaping (7) classification. Our files are maintained in 185 classi-

fications. A list of these classifications is attached.

The key to these numerically maintained files is the general index presently

consisting of over 58, 000, 000 index cards on all manner of subject matters but

primarily a name index of individuals. This master index must be searched to

determine what information, if any, the FBI may have in its files. In view of this

system, each communication must have a subject.

The classifier in the Classifying Unit of the Mail Processing Unit of the

Recoras Section in the Files and Communications Division designates the "subject"

of the particular communication on which a "main" index card is prepared; assigns

the classification showing the violation or nature of the matter involved; and designate

names in the body of the communication on which "see" (contraction for see reference

or cross-reference) index cards are to be prepared.

The "main" index card denotes that the name on index card is the subject of

the file and the name on "see" index card indicates the name is not the main subject

of the file but that the name only appears in a specific communication filed in the file

of a different subject matter.

The subject of the file may be on a variety of topics such as an individual,

organization, company, publication, foreign intelligence activities, or such adminis

trative items as space, equipment, or automobile accidents involving FBI automobiles

After the classifier has designated the "subject"' and assigned the classificati

for the communication, the classifier designates the names in the body of the com-

munication on which "see" index cards are to be prepared. The nature and extent of

## Page 125

detail in the communication require the classifier to utilize judgment as to whether

information should be designated for index cards. The classifier has general guide-

lines for each of the 185 classifications. Generally, in a criminal-type matter, the

following will be cross-indexed: suspects; uncooperative individuals; anyone giving:

assistance to the subject such as a person who allowed a bank robber to use his car

while committing a bank robbery; person passing, possessing and disposing of

ransom money; fences of stolen property; titles of song sheets or films being dis-

tributed in violation of copyright laws; madames and procurers; a person suspected

of harboring a fugitive; and the original complainant in the case.. Complainant is

indexed so that the investigation can be identified should the complainant make inquiry

- regarding his allegation at a later date.

- ..

---=

In security-type investigations, the classifier is governed by the type of

investigation and the nature and extent of the information in the communication.

The classifier will generally index associates and relatives of the subject; members

of organizations under investigation or determined to be possible subversive; indi-

viduals contributing funds to subversive-type activity; subversive or seditious

publications; writers of articles in subversive or seditious publications; bookstores

specializing in subversive-type publications and related types of information.

As an example of such indexing, the following indexing would occur in con-

nection with a case involving the investigation of an extortion threat against Congress-

man X in which the individual making the threat is unknown. The vast majority of

extortion cases we receive involve threats against individuals by unknown individuals.

As previously stated, each file must have a subject to insure all mail on a maiter is

filed in one place. Accordingly, in order to insure that all mail on an investigation

is placed in the same file, the victim's name is used as the subject of the file when

the individual who made the threat is unknown. Accordingly, Congressman X, as

the victim, would be subject of the file for mail filing purposes. The "main" index

card prepared would show that he is the victim and not the extortionist.

"See" index

cards will be prepared on any individuals suspected of writing the threatening letter.

Il a suspect is later identified as the extortionist, a "main" index card is prepared

• on his name to indicate we now have a file on this individual as the subject of a

specific criminal investigation.

As previously stated, access to the numerically maintained files is through

the index cards maintained in the general index. The index cards are, accordingly,

retained as long as the file is in existence.

Age of information in FBI files covers a relatively short span of years.

FBI had a relatively small number of files until the President, in 1939, directed the

FBI to be responsible for the internal security of the United States. In view of this

and, as the number of violations of law over which the FBI has jurisdiction has

increased greatly since 1939, the vast majority of FBI files has been created since

HH 54978 DocId: 32989724 Page 125

2.

---

## Page 126

1939. We do, however, have a program for destroying files which no longer have

a contemporary value.

Regulations of the National Archives and Records Service,

General Services Administration, issued under authority of Chapters 29, 31, and

33, Title 11, U.S. Code, govern our file retention and destruction procedures.

When the files are destroyed, the "main" and "see" cards for all matters in the

files are pulled from the general index and destroyed.
