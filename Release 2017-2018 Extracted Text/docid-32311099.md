Progress Report on

Project Star," which is the code name for

this research effort This report reflects that research is

under way to modify an existing Presidential limousine so that

its armor will stop 30-caliber ball ammunition. e Defense hopes

be able to produce a design for a

car by September 1, 1964,

which will be so well armored that it will

• stop-30-caliber

armor-piercing ammunition.

Additional research is being carried on to develop

a bullet-proof, grenade-proof, and explosive-proof speakers

platform for Presidential use.

In connection with this,

research is, being done on means

o'odistracting or aisruptin

an attack on the President and on acoustic and electronic

devices which will detect the approach of any projectile*

toward the President. 01-FYDCSV.0Hs

The helicopters sed by the President are to be

armored, and research is being conducted to make them safer.

PROJECT STAR

SECURITY THREAT ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH

Progres's Report

12 December 1963 - 20 January 1964

* In early December 1963, elements of the Department of Defense

initiated a research and development program in support of efforts

to reduce the vulnerability of important political persons to assas-

sination. This action was the result of arrangements made by the

U.S. Secret Service (USSS), the Director of the Office of Science.

and Technology (OST), the Director of Defense Research and Engineer-

ing (ODDR&E), and the Director of the Advanced Research Projects

Agency (ARPA).

The principal tasks are: (1) the modification of an existing limousine

to defeat 30 calibre ball ammunition, and delivery of the modified

vehicle in early March 1964; (2) the design of second-gereration im-

ousines to defeat .3O calibre armor-riercing ammunition, with ve-

and practicable countermeasures, to be completed by 15 January 1964;

(* detailed analysis of likely modes of attack and development anc

evaluation of appropriate countermeasures, with a phase report by

1 May 1964, and completion by 30 June 1965. The first task is re-

ferred to as the "quick-fix automobile," while the remaining tasks

are identified as Project STAR.

Quick-Fix Automobile:

Under the direction of representatives of Dr. E. G. Fubini, ODDR&E,

a group of people was assembled from ballistics and materials organ-

izations in ODDR&E, ARPA, Army, Navy and Air Forcè, to design

and specify modifications for the "quick-fix automobile."

A mock-up

of the modified auto was prepared by Hess and Eisenhardt of Cincinnati

and was approved by the USSS and ODDR&E representatives on 30

December 1963.

Armor materials are being tested by the U.S. Army Development and

Proof Services (DPS) at Aberdeen Proving Ground in accordance with

a test plan developed by the U.S. Army Tank and Automotive Center

(ATAC) and the U.S. Army Materials Research Agency (AMRA). This

work has been funded by the U.S. Army and ARPA.. Iransparent armor

materials are being provided by PittsburghPlate Glass.

The Ford Motor Company and Hess and Eisenhardt are incorporating

the approved modifications in the existing limousine. At this time

(20 January 1964) work on the quick-fix auto is on schedule. A more

difficult phase of this task - namely, the molding of curved transparent

armor sections - has been reached and some difficulties are expected

although no serious delays are anticipated. Detailed specifications for

the quick-fix auto are in the hands of the USSS.

Project STAR:

Project STAR - the remaining three tasks listed earlier - is under the

direction of representatives of Dr. R. L. Sproull, Director of ARPA.

Members of ODDR&E, USATAC, USAMRA, USADPS, USARO, the

Bureau of Naval Weapons, U.S. Air Force, USSS, CIA, State Department

Security. Office, and the FBI have participated with ARPA in STAR.

However, responsibility for any shortcomings in the work thus far rests

solely with the undersigned.

Security classification instructions under which Project STAR is operating

at the request of the Secret Service are contained in Enclosure 1.

Preliminary design specifications for the second-generation auto have

been developed by the Research Analysis Corporation (RAC) and were

given to the USSS on 15 January 1964. Preliminary analyses of securi-

ty threat characteristics and possible countermeasures have been com-

pleted by RAC, Rand and IDA, and were sent to the USSS on 20 January

1964. Details are contained in reports designated RAC-622. 1, Rand

L-820, and IDA Hq 64-2254. (Copies are attached as Enclosures 3, 4&5).

These deal, respectively, with scheduled transportation situations,

scheduled public appearances, and nonscheduled public appearances.

These reports contain preliminary assessments of threat character-

istics and tentative suggestions for countermeasures. They identify

some countermeasures which could be implemented immediately.

But they principally serve to identify areas which warrant detailed

study and investigation. Among these are some which should be com-

pleted insofar as possible by about I May 1964 in an effort to establish

detailed quantitative specifications for materials, techniques,

and

devices to be incorporated in vehicles and speakers' stands prior to

1 September. 1964.

These protective measures are to be the best that

can be developed and evaluated in this time-frame, büt it is recognized

that optimum measures will require more lengthy investigations and

experimentation.

The plan of work under Project STAR subsequent to 20 January 1964

includes the following tasks:

a.

Second and Subsequent Generation Automobiles: In coordina-

tion with manufacturers to be designated by the USSS and USATAC,

complete the detailed design of protective measures

Stor we automobiles

to be delivered to the USSS by 1 September 1964 and provide technical

advice on their fabrication.

One auto is to be closed, but with maxi-

mum visibility of the passengers; the other is to be open above the body

line, but also have optional means of enclosing the passenger com-

partment.

Within these limits, the dictates of conventional styling,

and the time available, protective measures listed in Enclosure 2

should be incorporated to the extent feasible. • (Initial report on 1 March

1964 on the second generation automobiles to be as complete as possible

at that time; modify and update the initial report as the results of the

other tasks under Project STAR become available. RAC.)

b. Speakers' Platforms: Design and evaluate means for defeat-

ing. 30 calibre AP projectiles, grenades, and explosives at indoor

and outdoor speakers! platforms.

These means should be inconspicu-

ous and transportable, and should permit rapid placement. No com-

ponent or section should weigh more than t0 pounds. Nonlethal

means for distracting or disrupting an incipient attack, and acoustic

sensing devices to detect the approach, impact, or passage of a

projectile should be included with platform protection kits. Results

of the other Project STAR tasks listed herein should be applied to

these requirements as those results become available. (An initial

design and report of its evaluation should be submitted by 1 May 1964.

Continuing work should be carried out beyond that date to incorporate

significant improvements in the initial design specifications as progress

on other tasks permits.)

c.

Helicopters:

(1) Analyze the design of the helicopters utilized by the

President to identify criticalareas for attack by 30 calibre AF

ammunition, and to assess personnel survivability in a crash.

prepare specifications for means such as light weight armor to

reduce the vulnerability of critical areas. Prepare specifications

for modifications needed to enhance the possibility of survival of

persons aboard in a crash. Include

an acoustic sensor to detect the

impact or passage of a projectile. (Report by 1 May 1964 to be as

complete as possible at that time; continue studies and experiments

to seek significant improvements through 30 June 1965. USATRECOM.)

(2) Evaluate the expected performance of the protective

measures and of the aircraft, and perform a comparative analysis of the

vulnerability, survivability, and aircraft performance with and without

the proposed protective measures. (Complete these tasks on the l May

1964 specifications prior. to 1. July 1964, and on additional improved

specifications proposed by USATRECOM as soon as possible. ' RAC)

d. Weapons: Identify likely classes of weapons employable by

an individual and their performance characteristics in termselkin

probability against an unprotected human target as a function of range,

angle of attack, CEP, and relative speed of the target..

Also, identify

the penetrating force of likely projectiles as a function of their velocity,

weight, shape, angle of incidence, and structure, and specify in useful

terms the forces to be defeated. (Progress report by 1 May 1964; to

be completed as soon thereafter as possible. RAC, in coordination

with the USA Ballistics Research Lab. )

e.

Situations: Develop and evaluate a methodology for quickly

identifying and assessing the relative significance, in terms of kill

probability, of vantage points available for the launching of an attack

in typical travel and public appearance situations. (Report on 1 May

1964 to be as complete as possible at that time; task to be completed

as soon thereafter as possible. RAC in coordination with the USSS.)

Persons and Data Processing: Identify an evaluate criteria

au technical means for extremely rapid processing it data on dange

numbers of suspected persons in order to identify those for whom some

specified degree of surveillance is warranted, and to facilitate estab-

lishment and maintenance of the required degree of surveillance by the

appropriate authorities.

(Report on 1 May 1964 to be as complete as

• possible at that time; task to be completed as soon thereafter as pos-

sible. Rand in coordination with the USSS.)

go Procedures:

(1) Evaluate procedures for marshalling the security capa-

bilities of the U.S. in support of the USSS and the Department of State

ities. Make recommendations for improvements. (To be completed

by 1 May 1964. Rand in coordination with the USSS.)

(2) Erom historical data,

develop methods and techniques

for evaluating the effectiveness of security operations for use by

USSS and the Department of State Security Division in the training of

their security agents. (Rand in coordination with the USSS, Depart-

ment of State Security Division, and others who may be designated by

ARPA.)

h. Detection Devices:;

(1) Develop and evaluate acousticat sensot systems to de-

tect the approach, mpact or passa

to 5000 ips in the vicinity. of the target.

passage of projectiles traveling at 700

Separate systems should be

designed to be carried inconspicuously by an agent, to be installed on

an automobile, and to be installed on rotary and fixed-wing subsonic

aircraft. Priority should be placed on detection of supersonic pro-

jectiles.

In the case of subsonic projectiles, detection of the muzzle

blast is acceptable. In both cases evaluation and design should elimi-

nate false alarms to the extent practicable. (Aircraft units to be the

responsibility of the U.S. Army Limited War Lab, using Thiokol or

Bissett-Berman as the contractor, as an extension of an esisting

joint Army-ARPA project; the man-carried and automobile units to

be the responsibility of the U.S. Army ERDI, using Melpar as a con-

tractor.

Work on all of these units should be completed prior to

1 July 1964.)

(2) Deyelon and evaluate systems to detect the presence

of concealed rearms and grenades

Both man-portable and fixed

systems, to be utilized inconspicuously at locations which give ac-

cess to the target are desired. It is essential that the false alarm

rate be extremely low. Furnish quantitative data on results. Pre-

pare specifications for any needed additional research and develop-

ment. (To be completed as soon as possible through parallel efforts

by Rand and by the Southwest Research Institute or Melpar under

USAERDI contract.)

(3) Evaluate systems

or techniques for detecting intrusion

of a fixed security area, such as the White House grounds.

Furnish

quantitative data on results. Prepare specifications for any needed

additional research and development. (To be completed as

possible.. IDA, in coordination with the USSS and the USAERDL.)

Armor Materials: Conduct an accelerated program to test

the effectiveness of transparent and opaque materials now available

in defeating • 30 cal. AP projectiles, grenades, and explosives.

Various combinations and configurations of materials should be

tested at various appropriate degrees of impact obliquity, and results

reported. Rigid and flexible materials in shapes and forms suitable

for use on automobiles, helicopters, speakers' platforms, and on

persons should receive priority. Furnish quantitative data on results.

Prepare specifications for any needed additional research and develop-

ment. (Tests to be carried out by Development and Proof Services,

Aberdeen Proving Ground in accordance with test plans to be developed

by. RAC, in coordination with U.S.A. Ballistics Research Lab, U.S. A.

Materials Research Agency, Bureau of Weapons, AFMT-RTD, and

Bureau of Standards. Initial report of results of testing of materials

for models of speakers' platforms and second generation automobiles

by 1 May 1964. Comparative evaluation of results and development

of specifications for needed additional research and development by

RAC. )

j. Distraction Devices: Develop and evaluate means for dis -

tracting or disrupting an incipient attack by, nonlethal means, such

as light, smoke, and means for rendering normally transparent areas

opaque. Both manually-operated and automatic means are to be con-

sidered. Man-portable means which are normally inconspicuous,

and means attached to autos or speakers' platforms are desired.

Furnish quantitative data on results.

Prepare specifications for any

needed additional research and development. (Report by 1 May. 1964

to be as complete as possible at that time; completion as soon there-

after as possible. Design of the means, development and technical

guidance of the implementation of a test program, and evaluation of

results, to be accomplished by IDA, in coordination with Bureau of

Weapons and AFMT-RTD. Hardware development and implementa-

tion of the test program by USAERDL, with assistance of appropriate

contractors.)

It will be noted from the foregoing that the remainder of the program

subsequent to 20 January 1964 consists of two categories of tasks.

First, for the transportation and public appearance situations, evalu-

ate such practicable materials, techniques and devices as can be de-

livered to the USSS by 1 September 1964, and prepare specifications

for any needed additional research and development. Second, carry

out lönger-term analyses, experiments and developmental work to.

be completed as soon as possible. It is expected that useful results

will be furnished the USSS as rapidly as they can be obtained rather

than awaiting some fixed date for report submission.

A monthly progress report, due by the first of each month, with the

first report to be submitted by 1 March 1964, should be submitted

to ARPA by each agency or contractor having tasks assigned to it.

ARPA will submit a monthly consolidated progress report by the

tenth of each month to DDR&E, OST, and USSS.

Detailed proposals and firm cost estimates for the above tasks will

be sought, with submissions to ARPA by 15 February 1964, or as

soon thereafter as possible. Implementation of each task will be

proposed to the Director of ARPA by the Project Manager of STAR

in accordance with estäblished ARPA procedures.

PROJECT STAR

Security Classifications

At the request of the U.S. Secret Service the following security

guidance has been adopted for Project STAR:

The acronym Project STAR is, itself, unclassified, unless the name

is associated with other material which is of a classified nature in

accordance with following guidance. In this latter case, the higher

classification involved will apply.

Written materials should be Confidential or Secret, according to

their content.. Any written material containing substantive analyses,

data, or recommendations should normally be Secret. Other written

materials should be Confidential. Nothing in writing which identifies

the subject matter of the writing with the substance of Project STAR

should be classified below Confidential.

Physical items - mock-ups, etc. - other than in written form, which

are not identifiable as being related uniquely to SIAR, are to be

classified according to their own nature. However, if they are,

identifiable by an observer with Project STAR and its purposes, they

will normally be Secret.

It is emphasized that all materials which could identify the purposes

of Project STAR, and tactics, techniques and devices as well as per-

formance data on materials which might be adopted as a consequence of

the Project are to be classified no lower than Secret and protected on a

strict need-to-know basis. Furthermore, STAR materials are not re-

leaseable to any agency other than ARPA without the explicit prior ap-

proval of ARPA.

In addition to the foregoing guidance, it is strongly emphasized that

in contacts with people or organizations other than within the Depart-

ment of Defense and the U.S. Secret Service, there must be no at-

tributable identification of Project STAR with the question of Presidential

security. Project STAR is, as you know, the short title for Security

Threat Analysis and Research. As such, it is concerned with threats

to political figures in general and any mention of its relation to

Presidential security in contacts with people other than from ARPA

and the United States Secret Service is both needless and prohibited.

STAR materials transmitted to ARPA will be coordinated with the U.S.

Secret Service by ARPA and concurrence of the Secret Service will be

abtained by ARPA before such materials are released to any other agency.

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

Second Generation Vehicles

rivi

Two vehicles, one open and one closed, are to be designed.

a. Protective Measures Desired:

(1) Protection to defeat. 30 cal. AP rounds at most likely

angles of attack.

(2) Protection to defeat thrown fragmentation grenades,

explosive charges, and Molotov cocktails.

(3) Techniques and devices for disrupting or degrading,

by nonlethal means, an incipient attack.

(4) Techniques and devices for detecting the approach,.

impact, or passage of projectiles traveling at 700 to 5000 fps, and

providing optional visual and audible alarm.

b. These autos also should possess the following characteristics:

(1) The two autos together should be transportable in a C-130

aircraft at a range of 2000 nm, and should be capable of being loaded

aboard this aircraft over

the ramp under their own power.

(2) Accommodate four people in the passenger compartment

with equal protection for all.

(3) In the case of the closed model, provide for ready opening

of a roof section to permit two people to stand erect. (A sliding section

is preferred.)

(4): In the case of the open model, provide optional trans-

parent armor protection above the body line.

(5) Turning radius and maneuverability should be improved

in comparison with the present Presidential limousine.

(6) The fuel tank should provide a range of at least 200

miles and should be self-sealing and be protected against blast effects.

Also, if feasible, it should be moved away from the passenger com-

partment.
