SUBJECT'S ASSOCIATION WITH MAX GARCIA

on september 10, 1961, MM I-l, who is personally

acquainted with subject, furnished the following information:

On September 9, 1960, subject indicated he had to go

to Cleveland-Hopkins Airport to meet MAX GARCIA of Tampa;

Florida, one of his associates. He was very secretive, however,

as to the nature of his association with GARCIA who, he said,

would stay at the Sheraton Cleveland Hotel during his visit.

On Noverber 4, 1960, EDWARD THOMAS PIATKOWSKI, 214E.

Milton Street,.

ed in Miami with Latin-American revolutionary activities, advised

SA GEORGE E, DAVIS, IR. he had recently met with a man known to

him as MAX REINARTS who was staying in Room 904, Cortez Hotel,

Miant, and who is acquainted with ELADIO DEL VALLE, a Cuban @M BALs

and leader of the anti-FIDEL CASTRO organization

Fuerzas Armadas y Civiles Anti-Comnista (FAYCA) PIATKOWSKI

said RETNARTS 13 also acquainted with ANSELMO ALIEGRO, a 7L CUBA

wealthy anti-CASTRO Cuban exile in Miami who las a reputation

for financing anti-CASTRO activities: PIATKOWSKI said REINARTS

had

represented himself to these Cubans as being in a position

to obtain and sell them guns

and claims to be an exporter from

Tampa, Florida

On November 3, 1960, REINARTS contacted PLATKOWSKI,

who had a reputation of being a soldier of fortune, and told

PIATOWSKI that a group of Dominican exiles had departed New

York City at 3:00 A.M. that day, en route to the Dominican

Republic (DR) on a "sell-out deal," in that they were to be

captured on their arrival in the DR by Dominican forces.

PIATKOWSKI said this group were reportedly members of an

organization led by (FNU) D'ALESSANDRO, a Dominican exile from

the New York City area who is opposed to the government of

GENERALISSIMO RAFAEL I. TRUJILLO, DR. According to

PIATKOWSKI, REINARTS also indicated

another group of Domini

can exiles from New York City would

soon be leaving on

another "sell-out deal" to the dr.

It is noted inguiry has failed to indicate that

any group has departed the United States to invade the DR.

It is further noted/that (FNU) D'ALESSANDRO iS

anti-TRUJILLO organization.

PIATKOWSKI said REINARTS asked if he was interest-

ed in a job, and informed him the DR was offering $50,000.

for D'ALESSANDRO alive in the DR. REINARTS claimed he had

been to the DR about a month prior thereto, and had personal-

ly talked with GERERALISSIMO TRUJILLO. REINARTS indicated

to PIATKOWSKI that PLATKOWSKI could have the job of going

to New York City and kidnaping D'ALESSANDRO, for which

REINARTS would pay him $25,000. REINARTS also indicated

to PIATKOWSKI he would have to talk to someone about

getting expense money for PIATKOWSKI's trip to New York

city.

On November 14, 1960, PIATKOWSKI identified a photo-

graph of MAX GARCIA as being identical with MAX REINARTS.

On November 7, 1960, U.S. Customs

Agent JOHN VAN

DIVER advised he had obtained the following information from

a source who has previously furnished reliable information:

On October 20, 1960, MAX REINARTS, who was on

November, 1960, residing in Room 904, Cortez Hotel, Miami,A

and one MIGUEL FONDEL.

CONZALEZ, a former Cuban

sea captain now residing in Miami, Florida, went to the

DR, apparently through arrangements of HUMBERTO TRUEBA.

It is noted that informant later identified, through

photographs, REINARTS to be identical with

this trip to the DR by these persons through records' of

Pan American World Airways and U. S. Customs records. These

records indicated that group went to the DR via Puerto

Rico on PAA Flight Number 451 on October

20, 1960, and

returned via PAA on October 22, 1960

On their arrival in the DR, GARCIA was reportedly

approached by a man, who was not known to the source, who

made some sort of a proposition to GARCIA, whereby GARCIA

would cause an invasion of the DR by anti-TRUJILLO Domini-

cans living in exile. The gist of

the proposition was

GARCIA would arrange

for the use of three boats for the

invasion force and arrange for obtaining arms for the

force, and also organize or cause the organization of the

force. It appeared to the source that the invasion force

VAN DIVER said from past experience he surmised

that the boats CARCIA was supposed to be able to furnish

were boats owned by EDWARD BROWDER, and the arms might

come

from BROwDER or DoMInIck Bartone, both of whom had

dealt in such things in the past. He said, in fact,

the above informanthad advised that following his return

to the United States, GARCIA was in contact with BROWDER,

who was to furnish two 110-foot boats for the invasion

force, along with arms, and subject was also in contact

with BARTONE, who was furnishing funds to GARCIA.

again met GARCIA who informed

him at that time that his

real name was MAX GARY REINERTS, but he goes by the

names

MAX GARCIA and MAXIMILLIANO GARCIA. PIATKOWSKI

said GARCIA advised he had heard nothing more about the

D'ALESSANDRO matter, but would telephone the DR about

it•

He also advised at that time, without being more

specific, that he had $600,000. worth of guns and

recoilless rifles.

On November 10, 1960, PIATKOWSKI said he had again

seen GARCIA that day, and GARCIA said he had contacted

someone from the DR concerning the D'ALESSANDRO matter and

told them he wanted $5,000. expense money before starting

anything. He said GARCIA furnished his telephone number

in Tampa, Florida, as 82-8661.

PIATKOWSKI said GARCIA lalso

advised at this time that an American who went with the

Dominicans,who previously had departed to invade the DR, was

on his way back to the U.S., and the rest of the group had

"been taken care of."

reliable, that he had been offered $50,000. to deliver

D'ALESSANDRO to the DR. GARCIA reportedly said this offer

was made to him by"JOHNNY,""

Dominican Intelligence:

SVAN DIVER said he had heard from

other sources that GARCIA

had mentioned a $100,000. deal

and a $50,000. deal, and had notes in his room pertaining

to such deals, but VAN DIVER could not be certain that this

information pertained to the above matter. He said his in-

vestigation indicated the DR had lost confidence in GARCIA

and was attentping to get him out of the proposed invasion

proposition

On December 5, 1960, PIATKOWSKI said he had seen

GARCIA that afternoon and GARCIA said he was leaving within

an hour for Tampa, Florida, to pick up some "stuff" and

then proceed to New York City.

PIATKOWSKI said GARCIA stated,

"It's all set. I am kidnaping D'ALESSANDRO." PIATKOWSKI

said he mentioned to GARCIA he had not seen FONDEUR fecently,

and GARCIA answered, "To hell with FONDEURS I have made

different arrangements." PIATKOWSKI said GARCIA then asked

him for the "contact number" in New York City, stating he

had lost his, and apparently believing PIATKOWSKI had know-

ledge of such a number, but he did not. PIATKOWSKI told

GARCIA he would attempt to get that number from MALDONADO.

Later that same evening, PIATKOWSKI advised he had

again seen GARCIA in Miami, and GARCIA indicated he was leaving

for New York City that night.

On December 6, 1960, PIATKOWSKI said he asked

MALDONADO about a "contact number' in New York City, and

MALDONADO said he did not know the name or number of the

contact in New York City, but he believed the contact was

at the Hotel Rossof. PIATKOWSKI said he saw GARCIA in

Miami late that morning, and GARCIA was still saying he was

departing for New York City. He said GARCIA also indicated

"these people" were trying to "cross" him, but he did not

need them and would go to New York and see some people.

PIATKOWSKI said GARCIA was not more specific in that matter.

It will be recalled that on December 7, 1960,

had been in Miami for about six years, and gave his occupa-

of his and he gave him a place to stay, as he was financially

embarrassed and he claimed he knew nothing of GARCIA's activi-

ties.

On December 6, 1960, FICKIE advised that an informant,

believed to be reliable, said he obtained the following informa-

tion from CARCIA:

GARCIA said he originally came to Miami at the expense

of, and on orders from, DOMINICK BARTONE to locate a buyer

for arms. His job was to check on the proposed transactions

and buyers to be sure that a legitimate proposition was available,

and if it was, he was to turn the whole matter over to BARTONE.

GARCIA claimed he did not know where BARTONE intended to get

the ams he desired to sell, but GARCIA surmised they would

come from Europe.

GARCIA told the informant he had been to

made to him that the

the DR alive. Also discussed at that time was the idea

that an invasion of the DR could be arranged for by CARCIA

and D'ALESSANDRO could be convinced to lead that expedition.

The expedition would then be entrapped in the DR and

D'ALESSANDRO captured, and it was suggested that perhaps

GARCIA would receive as much as $150,000. if he could

arrange it that way. According to the informant, GARCIA

indicated he did not like the idea of causing the deaths

of all those people, and he had no intention of going ahead

with the plan.

The following investigation was conducted by

SA H. K. RUTHERFORD in Tampa, Florida, relative to an allega-

tion that a Tampa City bus driver had

CARL HUGHES, Superintendent of Transportation,

Tampa Transit Company, Platt and Packwood Streets, advised on
