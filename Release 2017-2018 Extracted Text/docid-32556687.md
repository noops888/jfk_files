Dear Sir:

As you know, since the letter of your Office of February

1959, the

person was held under control each year when he came.

to Switzerland for his winter-holidays. In this letter he was

described as a well-known gangster in the United-States and as a

member of the Chicago crime syndicate. For this reason, your

services asked for a discreet check of his activities and contacts

while in Switzerland. with letter of April 22, 1959, your office

sent us a photograph of this man in order to facilitate searches.

With letter of May 12, 1959,

we received from your Office subject's

fingerprints, taken in USA under

Ir. 4244200 and under the name of

Alex Gus.

With letter of January 7,

1963

sent to your office copy of a:

letter handwritten by ALEX and adaressed to Baur-au-Lac Hotel in

Zurich.

With letter. of January 6,

1964,

we forwarded to your office a

hotel control note signed by AleX and a copy of his passport,

number D074551, issued in Chicago on 3/21/63 (date of birth

April 1, 1916).

With letter of January 17, 1964

we informed you that ATEX had:

telephon contacts with nr. 312 GA 38675 in Evergreen Park/Ill.

(this number appears again in subsequent letters of our office).

We sent you also 2 photographs taken at the Schlosshotel in

Pontresina, showing AuiX and FUGUR Dietgard, as well as a copy

o1 the note of arrival at the said hotel filled in by ALeX.

1 weth letter of January 24. 1061V 1

forwarded to your office a

L: photograph showing ALEX and FUEGER when arriving at zurich-Airport

With letter of January 14,

1965,

we sent to you another copy of

hotel control note

filled in by ALEX at the Schlosshotel in

Pontresina.

Due to your various requeste of searches and control of AlEX's

stays and contacts in Switzerland, the Zurich Police proposed

an interdiotion of entry in Switzerland against AliX who, on the

"base of the informations received from USA, must be constered

an undesirable foreigner. Therefore, a respective interdieuion

Federal Office dealing with Foreigners. This measure was notifiea

to Alix on his return to chicago (letter of Chicago Police dated.

March 16, 1965). Subsequently, AlEX appealed against this order o

interdiction of entry, pretending that the banished person was nou

identical with him.

On the base of the examination of hotel note copies,

cop

and the photographe mentioned above, the Swiss Federal Ofrice

dealing with Foreigners comes to the assumption that

Gae gerson

who was the subject of your requests and the interdiction of

entry

Into Switzerland may be two different persons. Due to these facts,

ALEX will be allowed to enter Switzerland on a further visit at

the end of this year.

Therefore, we ask you

to kindly let have made a new check in your

country, on the base and by comparison the documents sent by you

(photograph and fingerprints) and the pieces sent by us (copies of

hotel notes, copy of passport with photograph and photographs

taken in Zurich and Pontresina) in order to establish whether we

are in front of two different persons named ALEX Gus, forwarding

us the results of this enquiry at your earliest convenience.

Very truly yours,
