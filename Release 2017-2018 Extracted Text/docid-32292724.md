DAILY SUMMARY

CG 6576-C* advised that PAT MARCY's first order of

basiness on 1/16/63 was to telephonically contact TONY

ill

thay newas sending "this guy right over to see you now."

MARCY then informed an unknown individual in his presence

to "go see GIROLANI on the sixth floor across the street."

It is noted that GIROLAMI besides being Democratic Ward

Committeeman for the 29th Ward in Chicago is also Clerk of

the Probate Court at Chicago with offices on the sixth

floor of the County Building which is located across the

street from the First Ward regular Democratic organization.

For approximately an hour thereafter MARCY,

Alderman JOHN D'ARCO, and BUDDY JACOBSON then discussed the

usual affairs of the first Ward.

Following this, an unknown individual who was

called "BILL" by MARCY arrived and carried on the following

conversation. It is possible that this individual is identical

with BILL WITSMAN who is presently

working very closely with

Chief Investigator RICHARDICAIN as a Deputy Sheriff of Cook

County. It is believed that WITSMAN and CAIN were formerly

partners in a private detective agency in Chicago which

corroborates the tentative identification of WITSMAN.

UNKNOWN 1:

Incidently I told you that I caught some

fellow trying to get in here one day.

MARCY:

BILL:

Who's the ex-copper you got in your office?

Oh he's OK. I got 49% of that detective agency.

No I got this thing.

I told that lawyer that

I know that his man

knows the other guy and I

told him that I want him. I'll level with.

MITCH EDELSON is working apparently with the

bar association.

Doing special work. And 1

think that maybe one of the ambulance chasers

wanted to get into my office to find out what

MITCH might have had on him. But anyway we

don't want nobody here on Saturdays.

Here, do you want some more JOHN, after all this

and eat your heart out. This is only cash.

in out you hear

I don't want you to sit there

(counts out money)

Following the above, D'ARCO and MARCY discussed

,plans for a retirement dinner

for Chicago Police Captain RALPH

A SATANESE. They noted that GIROLAMI had taken two tables Tor

this dinner, State Senator BERNARD NEISTEIN one, Judge PASQUALE

"BUCK" SORRENTINO one table, and an unknown individual one

table. It is noted that CG

6498-PC has advised that he is

assisting in the organization of this dinner for CATANESE

who is retiring this month and that the dinner is to be held

later this month at the Chateau Royale in Chicago.

MARCY and D'ARCO then had the following conversation:

MARCY:

JOHN you got to get over this.

D'ARCO:

I'm over it PAT. But I was bad there for awhile.

Then when I saw what this little (obs) did,

I wanted to knock his head in. But BUDDY's

(JACOBSON) a goner.

MARCY:

But JOHN, you got to start getting around again.

Listen when you get down in Florida you had

better see LOU KOREN. Bum around with him a

little bit. He's a good guy.

D' ARCO:

Does he know what happened?

MARCY:

I think he knows something happened but doesn't

know just what.

He asked me if we were all all

right

and I told him that we were.
