copy of the SMABOVE interview of John A.

ROGALSKY, together with reproductions of documents and

correspondence

obtained from ROE, and photographs of the ROE

family.

"AEVALIANT/1" should be understood wherever "FUZZY"

occurs in the text.

2.. The ROEs were interviewed simultaneously but separately

in Toronto. Their recent application for Canadian citizenship

provided a

pretext for the interview.

3. ROE has explained his deposits to AEVALIANT/1's Peace

River bank account in terms of a series of three-cornered

transfers of funds for the support of ROE's mother-in-law, who

was still in China at that time. The documents which ROE has

supplied seem to substantiate his explanation of these transfers.

As noted in para 30 of the interview, SMABOVE is

apparently convinced of the plausibility of ROE's story, but

he and his wife have been asked to obtain more factual evidence

from his bank and from his mother-in-law. .

5. SMABOVE states that from the time ROE was contacted

by phone to arrange for the interview, he was under surveillance,

which continued for an unspecified period alter the interview.

SMABOVE states that his actions at that time appeared normal.

ROF's encounter with his friend, Paul POLOTSKY (para 29) was

observed, and his later admission of it is considered by SMABOVE

as a sign of sincerity on his part.

Jack Arthur ROGALSKY, now known as John ROl, born

on April 27, 1905 at Melitopol, Crimea, then Russia, is the

son of Abraham and Katherine ROGALSKY. ROGALSKY 1s of the

Hebrew race, but does not practice his religion.

ROGALSKY

had four sisters and two brothers, most of whom

are now

residing in North America.

Abraham ROGALSKy, his father,

was a grain trader In Melitopol, U.S.S.R. and in 1907 or 1908

moved to Harbin in Manchuria, where business opportunitles

were better as a result of the Russo-Japanese War.

Harbin

bad a large Russian population and the file subject was

educated In Russian schools in the area.

In 1920, the file

subject moved to shanghai, where he resided with two of his

sisters

and received further education at the Thomas

Hambury School which specialized in English.

1923, he was apprenticed in the import department of the

"Swiss firm of E. Huber & Company S... and the following Jeer

was promoted as Manager of the Import Department as a result

of the then incumbent maneger resigning over difficulties

with the management.

The firm specialized in the import

of sundries and textiles. In 1933, the Swiss principals

witharew their interests and the control of the company

was taken over by the Shanghai representatives. The f1rm

continued in operation for approximately a year and then

In 1935, RE, in company with his

went Into bankrupte paul koloR, took over operation of the

company under the name of two firms, the China Import Co.

and the China Export Co., with ROE handling the import and

KUMOR handling the export.

KOMOR had been the employee of

the Huber Company and was an expert in the leather trade.

One other additional trading company was formed under the

name of Paul KOMOR Co. Ltd.

KOMOR and ROE operated their companies all through

the war and the Japanese occupation, and ROE did not liquid-

ate his interests until it was quite apparent that

Communist Chinese would soon be taking over the area.

stated that trading opportunities were very slim during the

war but he also stated that he could have made a consider-

able fortune if he had been willing to trade with Germany

and he had had plenty of opportunities to do so through

Chinese fronts, but had refrained from doing so on patriotic

grounds. He further stated that he had reported through

KOMOR to the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai of any Shanghai

traders who were dealing with the German government.

ROE readily admitted that both he and his wife

had been registered with the Shanghai-Russian Citizens'

Association, but further stated that he had never been

active in the organization, nor had he ever had any dealings

with the official Russian representatives in that city:

Prior to the Japanese occupation of Shanghal, ROE had been

a corporal In the Shanghai Self-Defence Corps under Colonel

Moore COSGRAVE, whose civilian occupation was Commercial

Counsellor for Canada In China.

6.

ROl advised that the only travels he had made

whilst living in China were as follows. In 1935 he visited

Hong Kong on business for the Huber Company. Some time

prior to the war, he visited the city of Tientsin for one

week's holiday, and in 1937 or 1938 he spent two weeks!

vacation in the northern part of Korea at a well-known

vacation resort called Yankovsky's.

7.

On direct questioning, ROE denied any connection

with

the Soviet Citizens' Association in Shanghal, other

than being registered with this group.

The allegation that

he was a Brigadier of the Seventh Brigade was met with

incredulity.

He reiterated that the only organization with

which he had been connected was the Shanghal Self-Defence

Corps and this was disbanded on the occupation by the

Japanese of the city in 1942.

ROE denied any connection

with the Paragon Book Store but indicated that he was aware

of the purpose this organization served..

By way of explan-

ation, he stated that he had been connected as a partner

with a firm called Paragon Men's Wear, which was

located on

the Avenue Joffre, Shanghai.

8.

ROE explained that his brother-in-law,

Paul KOMOR,

had been an executive of an organization which was assisting

12222

refugees fron Europe during the early years of the war.

One

of the persons he had assisted was Liza ALTURA from Austria.

In 1942 at KOMOR's recommendation, ALTURA approached ROE to

secure financing for a men's wear shop she was to set up.

ROE loaned her the equivalent of a thousand dollars and was

a non-active partner in the shop until 1t was liquidated in

1947.

ALTURA is now married under the name of BEER and lives

in Caracas, Venezuela.

After the war, the subject and his brother-in-law

continued trading and among some of the firms dealt with

were Davis Leather Co. Lta. in Huntsville, head office

37 Front Street East, Toronto.

When it was evident to him

that the Chinese Communists would soon be taking over the

country, he decided to leave.

10.

He claims he made application to the U.S. Consulate

in Shanghai for a visa for permanent residence in the U.S.A.

Before the Chinese Communists entered Shanghal, the subject

had disposed of his business interests and cleared all his

debts.

He and his family therefore had little difficulty In

leaving Shanghai.

11.

With the help of UNRRA, he was able to obtair

passage on the u.s.s.

"General Gordon" which was evacuating

U.S. diplomatic personnel.

In order to obtain a U.S. transit

visa, he renounced his application for permanent residence in

the U.S.A.

ROE and his family arrived in San Francisco on

October 13, 1949, destined for Brazil. ROE had plans to

begin his import-export business again in Brazil.

• He spent

some three weeks with his brother-in-law, Paul KOMOR, who

managed to convince him that the government of Brazil was

quite corrupt and he would be better to attempt to remain

in the U.S.A.

ROE decided to visit Canada to re-establish

connections with the Davis Leather Co. and also Anglo-

Canadian Leather Co. Ltd. in the event he did go to Brazil.

They entered Canada on November 7, 1949 with a six months

visitors' visa.

ROE stated that they were so pleased with

Canada they decided to stay and, in February, made appli-

cation for permanent residence.

Their application was turned

down but later they were

granted an extension, and, finally,

landed status on March 26, 1959.

In addition, ROE was considering starting his own Import-

after writing for a number of samples of various lines, he

felt it was too precarious a venture and decided on a

position offering more security, and thus, the Travers job.

He presently operates a

ROE

also mentioned that he had met Eugene ELENSKY of

Weston,

an electrical engineer, who was a former

resident of Harbin.

16.

ROE then advised that he had the following

relatives:

Miss Dorothy ROE,

sister, Canadian citizen, employed

1914. Brother.

17.

At this point ROE was given time to think over his

answers and to consider carefully if he had been truthful and

complete in his story..

He indicated that he had. He was

then questioned as to his feelings about the Soviet Union.

ROE stated that he had spent most of his adult life in China

In the company of Russian emigres who no longer wished to

return to the U.S.S.R. and, in addition, he indicated that

Paul KOMUR, who is anti-communist, had a strong influence on

his l1fe and, therefore, had no pan-Slavic feelings about

In an effort to prove his point, Rot stated

that after the war the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai was

issuing passports to all Russian citizens. However, the

required a visa to enter the U.S.S.R. ROE and his wife did

not obtain passports which would obligate them to the

U.S.j.R., preferring to remain stateless.

ROE's brother

and sister, Michael and Dorothy, registered for soviet pass-

ports and with the Shanghai Soviet Citizens! Association.

18.

ROE was asked point-blank how long he had been

assisting the Russian Intelligence Service.

He was aston-

ished by this accusation and deniea any connection in this

respect. - He was then asked about his knowledge of Fuzzy

and he emphatically denied knowing such a person.

Ho was

prompted that this person may have resided in Alberta at

one time.

His recollection of the person indicated was

quite spontaneous then and he stated that he once sent

money to a man in Peace River, Alberta, but could not recall

He explained that his wife's mother, Mrs. Maria

SKOURIHINA, and her daughter were llving in Harbin,

Manchuria during the time the ROEs were in Shanghal. Jack

ROE and his brother-in-law, Herman MUENSTER and his wife

(Mrs. Ros's sister, Lucy) had been supporting Mrs. SKOURIHIKA

by sending parcels and money. After the Rots left Shanghai

for North America, Mrs. SKOURIHINA's support was carried on

А обир Во 02 1572 3 ОРНЕКА

by MUENSTER and in part by Dorothy ROE, subject's sister.

When MUENSTER and his family left for Germany in 1954,

Mrs. SKOUKIHINA had to locate additional avenues of support.

19.

At this time thère were a

good number of people

who were planning to leave or had left China and, due to

strict currency controls, were using various nethods to get

their funds out of the country.

a number of people who were willing to use their funds to

U.S.A., or other countries. ROE stated that he forwerded

funds to some five or six people in Canada and the U.S.A. in

this respect, but could not recall the names:

FUZZY and SIDOROFF did not mean anything to him, but the

mention of Peace River brought to mind the transier of lunas.

He believed that, in all, he forwarded some w200.o to the

party in Peace River in 1955 or 1956. ROE stated that he .

never knew the name of the party who supplied the funds in

China. Although ke cannot recall the exact amounts, ROE

stated that his mother-in-law was receiving between

$20.00

and $25.00 per month from 1955 until leaving China in 1958.

ROE assured the writer he would attempt to locate his old

bank books and any other documentation which might corrob-

orate and further clarify his submissions.

20.

Mrs.

ROE's story agreed with that of her husband

with a few natural differences. She was later allowed to

answer questions in the presence of her husband in

connection with the money transfer. Her narration in this

regard tallied with that of her husband, but she could not

shed any additional light on the names of the persons

connected with the money transfers.

21.

Mrs. ROE supplied the following background infor-

mation on herself:

Nadejda (Nadine) ROE, nee BEKETOFF, born July 1,

1914, Handoletze,

She moved to

Harbin with her family when several years oi

1944 and has one child, Catherine, born in

Shanghal, November 13,

her husband since marriage and has never been

employed other than as a housewife.

22.

In addition, Mrs. ROE related the names of the

which

outlines the methods used to transfer money, also the

adaress of the recipient, Mrs. SKOURIHINA.

The letter Is

addition,

Michael, had been a

member of the Shanghai Soviet Citizens' Association and was

active In social, sports, and dramatic activities with the

ROE contended that he was probably being

confused with his brother.

25.

With regard to identity documents used during his

11te, ROE explained up until the Japanese occupation he had

used a certificate of identity obtained through registration

with the Russian Emigrant Society and Issued by the Shanghai

City Government. ROE's certificate, No. 2376, 1s attached.

During the war he and his wife used certificates of identity

stated that in 1948 (using a city directory) the Emigrant

Society maintained offices at Lane 118, House 1, Mowming Rd.,

Shanghai.

ROE states he has always been shown as a former

Russian or stateless in all documentation.

26.

After the war he allowed his membership in the

Russian Emigrant Society to lapse, however, ha turned to them

Ior aid when it was apparent that

the Chinese Communists

would soon be taking over the country.

The Russian Emigrant

Society were planning to evacuate Russian emigrants to the

Island of Samar in the Philippines.

ROE decided against this

because of the unhealthy conditions for his daughter, but was

required to pay all his back dues in the organization. He

then requested them to attempt to obtain U.S. visas for him

and his family. At this time he and his wife had obtained

hurricane lamps and ski poles from the firm of Universal,

Foreign Trade Enterprise, Warsaw. ROE spoke to their repres-

entatives, Barbara KWIEK

and Wanda BOROWSKA, in August,

1962

at their booth at the Canadian National Exhibition In Toronto

regarding the import of camping and sporting goods. ROE

subsequently corresponded with the firm and produced the

invoices for the goods imported. The business cards of the

above-mentioned persons are attached.

ROE and his wife are not members of any

ROE has instituted an enquiry with his band in

effort to unearth further corroborating evidence of

dealings with FUZZY and others.

He also met with his

friend

Paul POLOTSKY, after our initial interview and

casually asked him about the Paragon Book Store and Ebel

ROMAN of Roman's Book Store.

Neither POLOTSKY nor the bank

is aware of the reasons for his enquiry, other than general

curiosity.

Mrs. Roe will be corresponding with her mother

shortly and will ask for a general rundown on the persons

and also her knowledge

who supplied money to her in China Mrs. ROE will not indicate

of their agents outside of China. Mrs. SKOURIHINA is now

the real reason for the enquiry.

residing at Sommerweg 42, Hamburg, Larup, Germany.

Comments on the Interview

30.

In reviewing the results of the ROE interview,

we

find he has related a rather convincing personal account

of his life which tends to indicate that his dealings with

FUZZY were not of an R.I.S. nature.

ROE's recollection that

he forwarded a total of approximately $200 for deposit in

a bank account at reace River,

Alberta in 1955 or 1956

compares favourably with our information which indicates

total deposits of $228.50 for the period October 5, 1955 to

May 1,

1956.

The results of the bank inquiry instituted by

ROE will be

as will the outcome

of Nirs. ROE's inquiry to her mother in Germany.
