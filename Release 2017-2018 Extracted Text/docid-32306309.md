his letteryto Mr. DI FEDERICO to the Bureau,

The would not (s

wish for it to receive any type of dissemination outside

the bureay, for obvious reasons

As a matter of information

PSI [SCHARA stated that in fact Firestone has 7.5 to 8 mil-C

lion dollars in property values' in Cuba and that this has

been acknowledged by the Cuban Claims Commission.

As the Bureau is aware, MARIO GARCIA KOHLY has

been the subject of past Bureau investigation (see Bufile

105-88521) and the proposition, as offered by FORSYTH, is

somewhat typical of other schemes in which KOHLY has at-

tempted to obtain money under an anti-CASTRO guise.

The resume, pertaining to PAUL SAVAGE FORSYTH lists

employments between 1946 to 1962 with the Reconstruction

Finance Corp., the (U,.S.) Department of State, CIA and the

Office of the Secretary of State. In this regard, it is

, noted that FORSYTH was, the subject of an AFA-A investigation

in 1953, and an ER investigation in 1950 (see Bufile

124-4733, WFO file 124-4201). FORSYTH is also mentioned in

WFO letter and LHM enclosed therewith, dated 7/28/55, and

captioned "UNKNOWN SUBJECT; Alleged Soviet RepresentativeLS

Who Contacted PAUL S. FORSYTH, June 9, 1955, IS - R."748

The foregoing is being provided to the Bureau in

the event it is desired to disseminate same.

provided source with copies of the aforementioned attach-

ments and thereafter indicated that ostensibly he is repre-

senting the exiled President of Ghana, Kwame

is extremely interested in investing approximately

$70,000,000 in seven per cent or better mortgages or other

suitable investment in the United States.. In that regard,

Forsyth is contacting large American corporations to deter-

mine if they desire to borrow any funds for capital invest-

ment or the like. In doing so, Forsyth is also affording

such contacted organizations the opportunity to invest,

under agreements such

as attachment four, funds with the

Cuban Military Junta for the reason indicated therein, this

through the FDC Resources and Management Corporation.

Forsyth also told source that Nkrumah may have close

to $100,000,000 available to him (from which the aforementioned

570,000,000 would be taken in Swiss banks and that it is

Nkrumah's intention to use these funds to invade Ghana and

regain

control of that country.

Forsyth told source that

Nkrumah believes he, Forsyth, and others are working toward

that end in Nkrumah's behalf.

Forsyth said that in fact it

is their intention to assemble an invasion force, which would

be based in Haiti, to train them and then ultimately divert

them to an invasion of Cuba, all of this at Nkrumah's expenses.

Forsyth told source he was contacting source's com-

pany since it was his understanding it had valuable assets in

Cuba which had been seized by Fidel Castro. Forsyth indicated

he previously approached the B. F. Goodrich Company with this

proposal and had been turned down.

Forsyth further told source that funds loaned or

invested in the United States through Forsyth and/or his

associates would have a .005 servicing fee.

Forsyth also

indicated that the .005 servicing fee would be distributed,

on a declining balance basis, in the following manner:

40 per cent to owners, 40 per cent to the Swiss

group' (presumably this would be Nkrumah and Swiss banks,

respectively; Forsyth did not specify), 25 per cent the

French group (1.e., FDC Resources and Management) and 33

per cent to the promotional group (i.e., Forsyth and

associates, although again he did not specify).

Source advised he had indicated to Forsyth that

he did not believe his company would care to participate in

such a

program.
