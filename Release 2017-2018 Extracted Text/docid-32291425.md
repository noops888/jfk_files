stated he had been in Miami during this time but refused to

furnish any information concerning his activities there. He

was questioned concerning telephone calls received at his

telephone number. from a

known South Carolina gambler, PAUL

THOMAS. (DL 165-68), and he admitted that such a call had

been received but the call had been placed by THOMAS to a

friend of OWENS from Miami who was in Dallas at

the time.

DAVIS denied any interstate communications for gambling

purposes or any interstate

travel for same. He refused

to discuss his wagering activity. He was

questioned con-

cerning his gambling debt of an alleged amount of $18,000

owed by him to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, gambler FRANK VUCI

(DL 165-118) DAVIS would only comment that he had taken

care of the matter and that he had lost the money in a poker

game in which VUCI was supposed to have: been his partner.

He stated that although the stories around town'had stated

the amount was $18,000, it was actually $5,000. OWENS made

a comment to the Bureau Agents which possibly reflects the

attitude of numerous Dallas gamblers, to wit, "Are you guys

bothering the other gamblers as much

as you are bothering

me?",

He then went on to explain that anyone connected

gambling in Dallas is quite upset over the intensified

efforts of the FBI and IRS in checking all gambling activities

company in Chicago and

had used them to "cheat suckers" in

He

claimed that after he had made some money through these

efforts he suddenly decided to quit because he was afraid

if he continued he might get into trouble with some other

gambler who would discover his activities.

to be cordial and cooperative and further contacts with him

him as an informant or source of information. He is an

operator of a private drinking club in Dallas and therefore,

in a position to be of possible assistance to the Bureau.

A review of the Dallas interview Program to date

reflects that in many instances pertinent information has

been obtained and several potentially good sources have

been developed.

It has also been noted that the Program

has created an uneasy atmosphere among the gambling element

in the Dallas area.

This discreet pressure along with

intensified investigation will be maintained by the Dallas

Division.
