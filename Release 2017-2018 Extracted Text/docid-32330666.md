4.

Follow separate Federal prosecution of MATTHEWS

per charges filed by IRS on 7/27/66.

ADMINISTRATIVE

Evidence developed by the Dallas Office in this case

was turned over to the Garland Police Department, after first

securing FBI interest with regard to Federal violation.

the basis of our investigation, the Garland Police Department

obtained warrants and

conducted the raid on their own.

Garland

Police Department has been cooperating fully in this matter.

Copies of the gambling paraphernalia have been obtained from

the Police Department

and are being sent to the FBI Laboratory

for analysis.

Bureau will note that previously Dallas had a

separate case on GEBRON which was closed after it appeared

he no longer was involved in bookmaking with MATTHEWS or by

himself; however, contact with DL 275-C-TE disclosed that

GEBRON was still

working with MATTHEWS and surveillance of

the location proved this to be true, when it was observed

that GEBRON was replacing MATTHEWS later in the day, and our

surveillances had not at that time extended that far.
