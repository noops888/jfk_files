ReMIairtel 8/12/64.

SA KENNETH J. HASER determined on 8/18/64, that

a special search by name of records of FBI Identification

Division

re JASPER GALLO produced negative results.

On 8/18/64, SA HASER determined through the Office

of Security, Department of State, that there is no record

of GALLO in the current visa files of State (1955 to date).

Noted that Visa Office has records on fewer than 1% of all U.S.

visas issued throughout world by reason of operation of

immigration laws which vest responsibility for issuance of

such visas in U. S. Consular Officess abroad.

In this

connection, if GALLO were issued U. S. non-imnigrant

visa in Italy at Embassy or Consulate there, record main-

tained there for four years.

If he were issued immigrant

visa at embassy or one of Consulates, record will be

maintained there 16 months and then destroyed. If other

investigation re GALLO's entry to U. S. negative, suggest

have Legat, Rome, check for post visa file.

Mrs. VERDE CRENSHAW, Passport Office, Department

o1 state, advised SA HASER 8/21/64,
