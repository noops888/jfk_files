Dear Jeremy:

(U) This is in response to Mr. David Marwell's letter

d. Which entity or entities are responsible for

operating the register?

e. Which entity or entities in the intelligence

community have made use of it?

f. To the extent it fell into disuse during the

period 1958-1965, what, if any, system replaced

(C) Please find enclosed for your review DO Instruction

some extent.

With respect to band f, we will continue to

search for data which will provide answers. We request that

the enclosure be returned when the Staff completes its

deliberations on this issue.

Dear Ms. Denk:

Reference: (C) ARRB Request No. CIA-10, for information

on the Interagency Source Register

(U) The following is responsive to referent request.

which recruit or deal with sources of foreign positive

intelligence outside the United States try to keep from

bumping into each other in the pursuit of such information.

It is for the further purpose of ensuring a source cannot

gain an unwarranted advantage by dealing with more than one

agency.

Each agency is responsible for registering an

individual as a source with the ISR before using

the

individual.

(C) The ISR was established in 1957 by the Intelligence

Advisory Committee, predecessor to the U.S. Intelligence

Board.

The ISR was not used extensively during the years

1958-1965 and we know of no system or procedure which took

its place.

(C) The first ISR regulations were in the form of

basic procedures each agency was to follow, procedures which

have gone through a number of reiterations.

ARRB staff

members have reviewed the classified, current written

instruction governing the existence and use of the ISR.
