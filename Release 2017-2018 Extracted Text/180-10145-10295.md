T. Meno dated 31 May 1967 by Ramond G. Rocca

Subject: Garrison and the Kennedy Assassination - Gordon Diane Novel

Summary - Novel has both claimed and denied CIA affiliation --

a thorough check of CTA records shows no affiliation. It is possible that

NBC is supporting Novel to get a large audience for expose of Garrison.

Novel may have exaggerated his presumed relationship with Sergio Arcacha

Novel is mysterious - little information - 29 year old former

owner of bar in French Quarter and an electronics expert.

C. In Columbus, Ohio, Novel is free on $10, 000 bond - living in a

rent-free apartment and drives a car with dealer tags. Rocca questions where

money is coming from.

D. Novel in Melena, Virginia 25-25 March 1967. Given a polygrap

by lloyd Furr.

Furr and Richard L. Bast operate firm Redex - sell audio

and counter audio devices.

CIA finds no evidence of ever having an Evergreen Advertising

Agency which Novel claims he worked for and was CIA front.

F. Records show CIA never recruited or paid Arcacha directly but

since he was associated with FRD in New Orleans, which was created with CIA

assistance, guidance anf financial support may have been given him through

the Miami FRD circa May 1960.

Dispatch from Chief of Base, JMWAVE

Date: August 4, 1961

Subject: Debriefing of Father Bastarrica

Father Bastarrica recently arrived from Cuba as a political exile. At a

luncheon meeting, he reported as follows:

MRP formed in Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amalio Fiallo

Gonzalez, DI. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera.

All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica. The name of MRP

was suggested by Raul Chibas and in itself it does not constitute a party

or group but rather a coalition of several suall groups, which were the

following:

a. The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray

b. Accion Democratica, led by Dr. Fiallo

c. Accion Verde Olivo, led by DI. Ruo Lopez Fresquet

à. 30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)

e. Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos

I. DI. Valdez Pino, in asylum in Embassy of Peru and belonged

to Accion Democratica.

Father Bastarrica's opinion of Ray is that he had no way of judging whether

Ray is Communist or Marxist.

Lacks quality of leadership because he

does not publically hold to

a definite political, social and economic ideology.

He appears to agree with every person he talks to, never arguing with them

or opposing them, all of which shows he has no ideology and makes him a

very dangerous man. Is extremely ambitous for himself, with great desire

for power.

Ray's Plans

Submitted by Henry D. Hecksher, WH/SA/SO/HH

Ray's plans to infiltrate Cuba by 20 May were discussed at meeting. Questions

about Ray's financing of Puerto Rican conference and ability to store arms

and engage in training activities on U.S. soil were raised by ANYUM/ I9(MRR)

Hecksher "quickly dissuaded him from divulging further details" at which

point AMIUM 19 commented that GUERTLER had reacted in a similar way when

offered facts and figures about Ray's activities. Artime stated he would

not put it past Ray to go into hiding in a secure place while pretending

to be in Cuba.

2. Cable to JMVAVE from DIR, 7 May 1964 - After looking at AMTAUP material,

it is obvious much of conspiratorial talk in JURE is for internal consumption

only, the purpose being to protect myth that JURE is independent as basically

hostile to CIA. In a desire to obtain proof of any anti-CIA or U.S. govt.

activity by Ray, urge every effort to check accuracy of AMTAUP/ANOT reporting

and follow through for any overt manifestations of many allegations made.

Origin of Autonomous Operations

Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by Higher Authority

in June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups

to supplement and assist in the execution" of other courses of action.

Concept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 in Walter Rostow's proposal for a

"Track Two" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-

controlled Cuban teams, CIA wolld extend

financial aid and some advice and

guidance to independent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement incorporated into June 1903 program.

"It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be

executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the

overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,

both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance.

2. The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost

in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations

can be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted,

they cannot be resumed.

3. All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory

of the United States.

4. The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly

any participation in these acts

no matter how loud or even how accurate may

be the reports of U.S. complicity.

5.

The United States presence and direct participation in the

operation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into an

operational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make it

clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except

to counter intervention by the soviets.

assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide

general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support.

He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations.

6.

These operations would not be undertaken within a fixed time

schedule."

4. Article from New York Times, Wednesday, July 15, 1964, bylined Tad Szulc

"Ray Said To Leave For Cuba Landing - Castro Foe, Balked in May, Reported

on way Again."

Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not

prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray had

believed he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba.

"Ray is politically

uvinformed -- politically that which he last read". Cisneros further stated

Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. According to

Manuel Ray for purpose of infiltrating JURE members into various organizations

which operated in Miami area, as well as into agencies of U.S. govt.

Further,

that in April 1963, Ray had issued orders to infiltrate a JURE member into CIA

drop leaflets into Cuba of a derogatory nature regarding U.S. govt.

cluded in these leaflets was Subject's manifesto against the U.S. govt and

Ray said relatives

of Gustavo Arcos in P.R. had telephone contact with Arcos family in Cuba,

about 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him

were thin. "( This means there was at least one more telephone call than

we knew of previously, and this has probably served to increase the pressure

on Arcos)." Anderson

tells of his concern and strong interest in Arcos on

the chance that Ray night assume Arcos had been CIA agent. Doesn't know

is Ray will construe remark this way but it seened like an opening "to use

an important exile channel as a possible deception nechanism."

"I believe that later in the sumer it might be a good idea to have

another talk with AlBANG to keep up with exile thinking, and feeding more

A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.

Stated the MRP in Havana is far less radical than

under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent

months.

Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro

regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations

in lavana.

Strength of HRP in havana estimated to exceed 1,000 -- success

measured more in terms of fund raising ability and blowing up of buildings.

buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials - they were tainted by

corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is

Most support is out of fear because the

people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of

I. Cable suggests that an offer of financial assistance to Ray's wife

and children from CIA rather than through the FRD may pay large future

dividends. Family to arrive circa September 1960.

2. Cable to Director

From: MASH

19 September 1960

Increasing suspicion RAUL CHIBAS a Castro plant. Since exfiltration by

KAPPES, CHIBAS has laid low but back in picture as representative of RAY.

Common knowledge that CHIBAS brought KAPPES out of cuba, but should be

noted that KAPPES has since been in and out of Cuba three times with

no apparent difficulties.

CHIBAS sources of information:

Mason in U. S. government

Maruel de Jesus and Bender as FRD representatives

Nino Diaz as Alianza representative

Don Hogan Kappes as Alberto Fernandex representative.

This should get a good picture of the U.S. anti-Castro activities.

3. Summer 1960. Ray very actively recruited to become FRD member.

* CIA considered him an important political asset. RAUL CHIBAS, Ray's

assistant, spoke for him with U.S. authorities. Urged strong organization

inside Cuba before outside help could be effective. CHIBAS meets with

Bender 9/7/60, says he is in favor of FRD but completely committed to

Ray and would

check with him.

At a 20 September 1960 meeting, Ray's name was suggested for inclusion

in FRD and State desired to look further into his background. Ray was

discussed again on 9/27/60 with Mr. Divine who further conferred with

Ambassador Mallory same day and Mallory approved Ray's inclusion.

September 29, 1960 cable from MASH to WH9 indicates MASH somewhat

doubtful about Ray's feelings toward U.S. and continued dealings with

this group needs further policy consideration.

Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is

concerned.

Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles

unified in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1940

constitution. Provisional goverment of 30 honorable Cubans would be

established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed

at beginning of his regime to be promilgated. State would regulate

private investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" - each member to have specific

responsibilities and feel important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also

asked for $10, 000 by next Wednesday - Bender made commitment.

Subject: Manolo Ray Rivero

12 July 1962

"Ray has indicated to WAVE sources that whereas he is not persona grata

with the Agency, he has important political connections in Washington and

is thus kept informed of much of the Agency's activities. Ray's new

organization is not to be military or engage in military thrusts against

Cuba because military activity is presently controlled by the Agency and

cannot be wrested from it at this time. Ray's new organization will

cooperate with the Consejo and attempt to move in on it with the ultimate

aim of taking over and dominating it."

in Cuba. Ray's political views ase assessed as democratically oriented, and

if he became ruler of Cuba, his greatest preoccupation would be with economic

progress.

from persons close to Ray and their views are complete reliable. Ray did

not leave Castro's cabinet because of ideological or policy discrepancies

with Castro but because of a heated discussion with the Minister of Labor.

Martinez Sanchez, who almost shot Ray after a Cabinet meeting. The sources

of information agree that Ray is not any different than Castro. Some of

them believe he may not have completely severed his relations with Castro

and think he may still be in contact ith him. Diplomatic relations were

suspended but recognition was not withdrawn.

1. Memo from Jack Malone, dated July 15, 1962 Cover letter addressed
