always thought the name was MACCALUCCI, but he assumes

the slight difference in pronunciation was his own

error.

At any rate, it was from conversation with

TONY MACK and JOE ZITTO at Rockford on 8/8/64 that

informant learned of GALLO's visit to the United

States.

Informant said on 8/26/64 that he had heard

no more about GALLO, but undoubtedly will the next

time he can get to Rockford.

If any of this

information on GALLO's visit is set out in details of

a report, the fact informant is from Milwaukee, that

he learned of the above in Rockford or that he

learned same through TONY MACK and JOE ZITTO, should

be ommitted and confined to the administrative pages

for the informant's security.

On 8/26/64 MI 623-C-TE advised that on the night of

8/23/64 GUS GIAVINGO. of Chicago was in Milwaukee and

was in contact with FRANK BALISTRIERI, boss of the

Milwaukee outfit.

They were seen together at Fazio's

on 5th Street and were with JOHN AIELLO, JERRY

DI MAGGIO and several other Milwaukeeans.. Informant

said he did not know GIAVINGO's purpose but would try

to find out. He said that GIAVINGO was very close

to TONY MACK, previously mentioned, and was a member

of La Cosa Nostra in Chicago. He said he was about

1,nd PACK, strey

FRANK BALISTRIERI and was trusted by BALISTRIERI.
