manages a restaurant allegedly owned by another unidentified Chinese

Azores. Ling is one of several Chinese subjects who are suspected of

using their business ventures as a cover for espionage or other illegal

activities. The CIA report also reflects that one Theodor Heinz Wiener

who had represented the clothing firm in the Azores, was reportedly

arrested there in December 1958 on suspicion of espionage,

and was, as

of September 1960, reportedly in Bermuda, where Ling was planning to go

to determine the feasibility of establishing another restaurant.

Jot 3. It is requested that Subject be questioned concerning the nature and

extent of his association with Ling and other Chinese, and that this

office be advised of any information which may reflect espionage or

other illegal activities affecting USAF interests.

His possible associ

ation with Wiener also should be explored.
