NUMBERS OPERATION, DETROIT

Source advised that the numbers operation in Detroit

has been in

existence for many years and he has been

closely

associated with it for the past 25 years.

Source advised that

when he entered the operation, the man who completely controlled

the operation was PETER CORRADO and when he died in 1957, he

had headed this operation for 28 years. During this time, PETER

CORRADO developed the organization, made all decisions, and

was in complete control of the numbers operation together with

all other forms of gambling in Detroit.

The basic rule of

PETER CORRADO in

the numbers business

during all of this time

was that the business is to be run as if it were a

a legitimate

business.

The source furnished the following

Illustration:

In 1952, the number 101 came up as the winning number.

This is known as a lancy and it is always played very heavily.

On this particular day when the tapes were totaled the amount

of money to be paid out amounted to one and three-quarter

million dollars.

There was utter confugion and chaos and

FRANK DI MAGGIO Came Up tO PITER CORRADO and said "Boss, we

are wiped out.". You can't pay.

You will have to drop the odds

to 300 to 1 from 500 to 1."

PETER CORRADO said "When the bets

were called in what odds did you take them at." DI MAGGIO

said 500 to 1.

PETER. CORRADO them said then we pay off at

500 to I:

CORRADO called each person who had a percentage

of any one of each of

the four houses and told how much money

he had to come up with that night.

Many stated that they did

not have this amount of money and PETER CORRADO loaned each

one their necessary amount of money. By 6:00 &.m., $1,750,000.00

was raised and distributed. Source advised he delivered

$90,000.00 in $100.00. bills, wrapped in newspaper which was yellow

with age.

Within

six months this loss had been absorbed and the

numbers operation was

again making very heavy profits.

Source stated there vere four houses which were

owned and controlled by the family.

Each of these houses

operated until October 25, 1963, when they went out of business

upon orders of JOSEPH ZERILLI.

Fifty percent of each house was

owned by the members of the three families, ZERILLI, TOCCO and

CORRADO.

The ownership of the remainder was divided among

operators of the various houses.

These houses are as follows:
