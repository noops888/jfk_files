of a second, also al interest, which be mill proceed to discuss to the

confusion of the first. This problem was perhapa compounded by tbe

fact that Subject was uncertain as to the type of information of Interest

He grasped quicily, however,: he type of information

which would be of most Interest to us and it rapidly became less difticult

to get to the meat al the subject ve were discussing. Further contact

and debriefing of him will become progressively lesa difficule.

1. We are consolidating the informaur? obtained from Subject

8o subject in set forth below:

# Erublo AZCUE, born about 1012, ls precently

employed as a consul at the Cuban Embanay in Marleo

City. AZCUE in a long time friend of Subject. They met

during the mid-1950's when both were involved lu revolu

tonary acivities attempting to bring about a democratie

socimllet regime in Cuba. AZCUE le married to & Spanish

woman and was lavolved in the Spanish revolution. He

was a very close irtend of Manolo CASTRO who was

reportedly murdered by a group of Communist left wing

reckomares which included Fidal CAsTRO.

About

105% AZCUE was living in France and la belleved to have

been arrested by French nuthorities on charges resulting

from his involvement in smuggling rentuttlir and other

antibloties into France.

Subject believes that AZCUE ham

about live children. During early 1901 whilo in Marico

City, AZCUE was contacted by Subjeci in order so obtaln

advice re the advisability of hin detecting from the Cantro

rogime and requesting sollticad asylum in Mexic% As a

result of this contact Subject obtained tbe impresaion that

AZCUE la suffering from a lack of funds. Since ALCUE

In somewhat ol i anoD and a fascy dresser, be linda this

situation unpleasant.

ALCUE Alao habitually has a min-

tress which in turn is a drain on hia pocketbook

(1) According to Subject, AZCUE is an

excellent draftsman who studied architecture

nt the University of Habana, although he pever

obtailuad a dogree. Subject assesses him as a

did man, very happy-go-lucky, but impetuou

and one who "blows with the wind". He doosn't

seem to have the powers of conceniralion or of

single purpose which would ailow him to be suc-

commial.

Subject feela that ALCUE has appended

himself to the Castro regime since lt ollera him

« purpose in dire and a feeling of belonging to

nomething.

(3) Subject described AZCUE as being i

very brave man. He felt that should AZCUE be

approached by hUBARk and requested to coop-

erate, the physical danger inherent to in-place

agent work would not alfect hia deciaion. In

Bummily there would be a reachable chance of

porsunding AZCUE to cooperate with KUBARK 11

their 1061 conversations in Mexico City, that

favor of it during the ensuing portod

(8) Subjec, ippended that it would be halpful

According to subject, GUTIERREZ was formerly & Cuban

As an aside,

Bubject stated that GUTIERREZ had supplied weapona to Fidel CASTRO

during the 1058-58 period through an individual who ta knew enly an

from a (Inu) SAGARO who was a resident of Sartiago de Cuba. Of even

15. UFGA 7428, 31 January 1963, contains Information obtained

by JMWAVE regarding Subject and indicated hira to be emotionally un-

#tablo, eccentric, and generally reputed to be something of a rut. We

are Inclined to agree with this information in so far ae Subject's eco-

nomical theory is concerned. During his stay of almost one year as

an asylee in the aigentine Embassy in Habana, Subject spent the coplous

spare time available to him writing an economic treatise. On our meet-

Ing with Subject on May 4th, Subject provided un with a handwritten

short summary of this docament. According to thie summary, Subject

ham been attempting to correlate economic cycles with peaks of sunspot

activity. He backs up his "economic argument" with reference to the

Old Testament and the Artec Calendar.

If Subject has been expounding

this thory in public we are not surprised that he la considered some-

what of a nut. It should be noted, however, that many otberwise sane

and unetul people belleve in horoscopes and other similar superstitione.

We do not feel that this quirk in his personality must necessarily be con-

aldered derogatory in terma of his possibie operational exploitation by

KUBARK. Although we have spent leas than ten hours with Subject, our

Impresalon lu that be la a rational individual in terme of his attitude

towards and relationwhipe with other individuals and permonalities around

him. As a matter of fact, we obtained the impression that Subject pos-

sonnes more than his fair share of what la sometimes termed "common

sonne". The handwritten summary of Subject's economic theory an per-

taining to cunspots le apperied to this memorandum as attachment.
