MEMORANDUM FOR:

Mr. John M. Reeves

Chief, External Affairs Branch

Office of Security

FROM

SUBJECT

:

Richard S. Sampson

Chief, Latin America Division

: Mr. David Phillips' Manuscript

1. Following are comments on chapters 2, 5 and 11 of

this manuscript which have been reviewed in LA Division:

2. Chapter N

The portion

on the terrorist kidnapping in the

Dominican Republic in 1974 (pages

38-41) should be

deleted for the following reasons:

(1) This incident is still fresh in the minds

of most Dominicans, and it is unrealistic to assume

that it will not be picked up and published in the

local press.

sarbara Hutchison, USIA, one ot the

people kidnapped, is still in the Dominican Republic

and according to

two fairly recent reports, is again

being considered as a target for kidnapping.

The

potential for terrorist acts against US citizens

continues, three top leaders of terrorist-oriented

groups are currently in prison, and publication of

this item could propel the terrorists into action.

(2) The close link between the Ambassador and

the CIA which the author portrays could be prejudicial

to his public image and might even provoke the

terrorists to

target against him.

The Station has renewed

Change in command

and much effort is being directed toward developing

a relationship of mutual confidence. The revelation

of this information on an obvious

by the then Chief, LA, might lead our t

contacts to wonder whether we

might be able to maintain confidence on future

operations, and possibly jeopardize this relation-

ship.

(4) Although the bugging of the thermos was

discovered and appeared in the press, the use of

the Coca Cola case did not receive such exposure

and therefore continues to be an option for the

-tuture, at least as far as the

is concerned.

Perhaps

the author should be reminded

of a cable that was written during his tenure as

Chief,

LA with regard to this particular audio 24

operation:

"BOTH EMBASSY ANDI

SHOULD

BE CAUTIONED TO HOLD EXISTENCE THIS OP TIGHTLY AS

POSSIBLE TO LEAVE OPEN CHANCE USE THIS PLOY IN FUTURE

CASES AS WELL AS PREVENT ADVERSE ACTION BY PRESENT

Reference the author's footnote (page 39)

that "Philip Agee long ago revealed..." this technique,

Agee's revelation is certainly no criteria for further

disclosure.

b.

The passage regarding CIA's role in countering

terrorist activity abroad

should be deleted.

The author

singles out the Agency as "Only CIA, of American agencies

abroad, is uniquely charged with countering these activi-

ties".

This could only increase the targetting of our

personnel by terrorists, and possibly lead

Welsh-type incident.

to another

c.

The author's confirmation of Agee's identification

of CIA personnel should be deleted as well as the author's

information on the disruption of Agency operations which

resulted from Agee's

exposes

(pages 5-6, 41-43). Undoubtedly

gee and his ilk would be delighted with this gratis exposure

and derive satisfaction in having it made known

public, by one with first-hand knowledge, what impact

exposes have on CIA operations, morale, etc.

Y and leaves the reader pretty well

convinced that there

was involvement in the latter (pages 5, 16, 30).

e. The following passages should be cleared with

the appropriate Agency components:

P36 T KGB (page 36). This operation took place int

(1) SE Division: The operation against the

(2) NE Division: The Arab terrorist activity

in "Costa Brava" - which is Venezuela - and follow-up

information involving the Middle East,

and apparently

a telephone-tap operation (pages 36-38).

f. The author notes (page 4) that more is being

written on Chile operations.

It is requested that this

item'be submitted for review by this Division prior to

publication.

3. Chapter 54

a.

There are

no passages which we can require be

deleted.

b. The following passages should be cleared with

the appropriate Agency components:

(1) Reference to the Gulf Steamship Company

being used as a cover for the broadcast aspects of

the Bay of Pigs operation (pages 12 and 22). When

checking this copy are teen mus cript be sent to so

component for review.

(2)

Use of a New York public relations firm (not

identified by name) which was "responsive to CIA

control" (page 32).

Other books and publications have

identified the Lem Jones Associates as having handled

the public relations aspects, but nowhere have we

found 1t alleged to have been CIA-controlled.

Some

articles indicate that there is actually a Mr. Lem

Jones, who was president of the firm.

Perhaps the

author's allegation that it was CIA-controlled should

be deleted.

a solid basis

Again, no passages were found for which there is

on which we can require deletion.

b.

The following passages should be cleared with

the appropriate Agency components:

(1) CIA-FBI cooperation:

FBI assistance in arranging the author's release

from jail (page 7).

-The Agency's capability to alter FBI criminal

records (page 8).

(2) The Agency's preparation/use of false identity

papers, including in the US (pages 1, 2, 3, 14, I6).

(3) CIA's payment for the

Ivessel that was

sunk during the Guatemala 1954 operation (page 35).

We have turned up notations that indicate no payment

had been made as of August 1960.

(5) Use of Agency funds for what could be con-

4 sidered rather frivolous purposes (pages 18-19 and 21).
