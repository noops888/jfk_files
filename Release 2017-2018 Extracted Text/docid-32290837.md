CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

DALLAS DIVISION

From information developed from confidential

sources and from information in Fort Worth newspapers, the

Ft. Worth PD will be investigated by Chief of Police CATO

HIGHTOWER and City Manager L. P. COOKINGHAM since the Ft.

Worth City Council failed to back the last Tarrant County

Grand Jurors' report that there were irregularities in the

Ft. Worth PD.

Ft. Worth papers that he was ordering a full investigation of

the City PD.and promised to get to the bottom of what the GJ

called irregularities in the Department.

COOKINGHAM ordered

the 53 supervisory officers of the PD to weed out all the

men who were not performing their duties.

Sheriff LON EVANS and PCIL

Tof the

Office both feel that nothing will come

of the investigation and the PD will get a clean bill of

health.

OTHER 4

Bureau will be kept advised.
