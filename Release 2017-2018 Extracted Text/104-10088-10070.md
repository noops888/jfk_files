the Counter Intelligence Staff will inform the Office of Security of this

fact. In this event, the Counter Intelligence Stalf and the Securlty Support

RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE OF CERTAIN

CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS

Rescission: CSI 50-10, 13 July 1970

1. GENERAL

a Elemental in the conduct of clandestine operations is the use of human

agents to accomplish the missions of the Operations Directorate. In gen-

era, it is DDO policy to select agent assets with primary regard to the

agents®

abilities, target access; and security, and with few restrictions as

to their origins, professions or status as members of particular groups. The

basic rule is that any

consenting adult may be used by the Operations

Directorate. There are, however, certain sensitive categories of individuals

or groups whose operational use by the Operations Directorate is prohibited

or in some way restricted for reasons not necessarily related to security

considerations.

b. These prohibitions or restrictions stem from one of the following:

(1) The Agency has

been directed by . U.S. Governmental authority to

restrict or avoid the operational use of a particular category of in-

dividuals.

(2) The Agency has entered into a special restrictive agreement with an

organization, government, corporation, or official responsible for a

category of individuals a

(3) The Director or the Deputy Director for Operations has imposed

restrictions on the operational use of a certain category of individuals

due to the extreme risk or sensitivity of such exploitation.

2. PURPOSE

The purpose of this instruction is to set forth the prohibitions and policy

restrictions (as distinguished from security restrictions) which currently var-

tain to toe operational ise of various categories of individuals, together with

the special approval procedures to be followed in cortain cases. Where ap-

propriate, reference has been made to mother publication which provides

more detailed guidance than has been attempted in this instruction. The

special approval procedures set forth in this instruction do not supersede or

alter in any way the requirements for covert approval contained in DOI

and DOI-F 10-5.

3. DEFINITIONS

Within the context of this instruction, the definitions listed below will apply

Special note must be taken of the fact that the ley term- "operationa? use".

employed throughout this instruction has been defined in the most succinct

manner consistent with clarity. It has not been feasible, however, to cover in

a definition the entire scope of possible variations in operational circumstances

which may be encountered in DDO activities. The definition of "operational

use" is intended to provide guidance for the majority of cases, and must be

employed with responsible operational judgment. Issues involving a deter-

mination of "operational use" which cannot be resolved with reasonable as-

surance by the responsible operating components will be referred to the

Deputy Director for Operations for decision.

a. Operational Use

Operational use is interpreted to mean the recruitment, utilization, or train-

ing of any individual or group for DDO purposes on either a witting of

unwitting basis by or on the behalf of an element of the Operations Direc-

torate. Utilization is made of an individual or group whenever that in-

dividual or group, responding to the direction or solicitation of a DDO

element, provides information, performs services, provides cover, or supplies

financial, material, or other support necessary for, the accomplishment of

DDO operational objectives either directly or indirectly, to or for an ele-

ment of the Operations Directorate.

b. DDO Element

Any person or group who or which is responsible to, owned or controlled

either directly or indirectly by the Operations Directorate. Included under

this definition are employees or members of Agency proprietary mech-

anisins.

c. Operational Contact

Any association having as its purpose the initiation or furtherance of DDO

operations.

4. RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE

a. Restrictions on the operational use of individuals or groups are of four types

and cover twenty five separate categories as outlined below and as described

in greater detail in paragraphs 5 through 8 of this instruction:

(1) Operational Use is Prohibiteil (see paragraph 5) :

privileges specified, in their contracts. They work under supervised con-

ditions and are compansated on & salary. bass. Contract employees are

grouped into three categories:

operational value to the Agency for not less than three years, in the

case of U.S. citizens, or not less than five y

s, in the case of foreign

natlonals, to quality for career, asspciatel

for a career associate to have the'stall-type access to an Agency instal-

for a specific perlod of time, who normally work inside Agency Instal-

atlons. They are required to meet the same security approval criteria

as stall employees, but are permitted only such access to classified

ployees. They are permitted only such access to classifled information

formance of their dutles.

to the direction, utilization, spotting, or support of agents. They normally

do nöt carry out espionage or covert action tasks. (Care must be taken
