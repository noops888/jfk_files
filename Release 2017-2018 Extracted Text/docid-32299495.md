"Police Passport Control Officers recognized Bruno and recog-

/nized passport as being false.

will probably place him aboard plane to take him back to Canada from

where he came.

Theory of Italian Police is that Bruno may have used

false passport on all of his travels from the U.s. to Italy. "(G-1)(u)

Legal Attache Joe Michela related that Legat, Bonn has

been advised fand will contact Dutch authorities (3›
