SUBJECT.

REMARKS I have discussed with Paul Burke, DC/CI/ICG, Mexico's request for mendent. of OA

to use LICOOKY-1 against the Soviet official. We both are of the opinion that she

can be used for development of the target to detemine his susceptibility to recruit

ment, but' that she should not be used to make the actual recruitment:should the matter

developmost to that point, due to these considerations: I) She is not a recruiter,

iever has made a recruitment. (2) Odds are she would be blown to the soviets, since

we must consider that the odds for successful recruitment of a Soviet official are not

favorable.

(3) Her relationship with LINLUCK: in Mexico is fairly well known, so that

there could be an unfavorable blow back on INLUCK!'

In authorizing her use in the developmental role, Burke would like for Station to

be inforned that it shogld tell LINLUCK that Station's continuing investigation of

LICOOKY-1 discloses her association with Soviets; therefore, he should be: tery

careful in his relationship with her.
