SUBJECT:

LEE HARVEY OSWALD

on 1/13/64 Ex-18 and Mex-19braily advised the

writer that on that date ELIZABETH MORA had told them of a

conversation which she had held with TERES

PROENZA,

the

Cultural Attache of the Cuban Embassy

OSWALD walked 1n

the first

person he talked to wa's TERESA. She does

not speak English,

however, and therefore she turned him over to the nearest

person (not identifled by MORA) wh was higher in rank and who

• spoke English.

TERESA PROENZA claimed that the purpose of

OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy was to obtain a visa to

go to Russia.

The informants could obtain no information from

MORA why OSWALD would have gone to the Cuban Embassy which is

to the Soviet

Embassy which is much easier to locate.
