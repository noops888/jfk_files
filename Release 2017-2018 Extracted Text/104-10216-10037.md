Suave: (a nickname for UNS:AFU/9)

Today I spoke to a friend in the iinistry of Forsign Relations, He explained

• your situation woll enough (or, it zay be, correctly enough): ho told me that

to anyone

they had sent your Cuban passports back, gonething that has never been dore/before.

(He also said that you both can come back when ever you want to, to your country.

This made me very happy because your situation has been completely claritied.

I should se happy to hear fron jou as soon as you receive this letter.

"El loco" Alberto arrived tho days ago, to everyone's surprise, but goodness,

that's the way he is. It seems that he was nostalgic for his country.

This letter was delayed a long time in readzen to because a herayed

(his return) a long time here - because the CHEKA/scares him.

Best, Rolando
