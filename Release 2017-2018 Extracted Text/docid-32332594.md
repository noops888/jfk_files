On August 8, 1974, SJ 1438-PSI advised that he had

not closely followed the activities of individuals who abandoned

the Partido Revolucionario del Pueblo (Peoples Revolutionary

capacity of Cuban exiles in San Juan, Puerto Rico, who favor

a more active fight against the CASTRO regime through any

means to bring about the downfall of CASTRO.

Puerto Rico, telephone number 783-9054.

He advised that

LOPEZ LAY was a close friend of ENRIQUE NUNEZ and was an

associate of NUNEZ with the newspaper "Replica" published

at San Juan, Puerto Rico. Source doubted that LOPEZ LAY

would discuss NUNEZ' activities with the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) •

on 8/8/74, SJ 1377-PCI, who resides on Calle

Hipodromo, Stop 19,

area of santurce,

Puerto Rico, advised

that by chance she was sitting on her balcony, which faces

calle Hipodromo, at 3:00 AM, 8/6/74. At that

time, she

heard a single loud explosion from which direction she

could not at that time discern. Thereafter, about fifteen

minutes later, an automobile came down Calle Hipodromo and

stopped at a building on the same side of the street as her

residence and to the south of it.. She advised this was

remembered in that there was no traffic on the streets at

this time. The car pulled up in front of the building,

which she advised has a dress shop on the ground floor, and

which is located between Avenida Fernandez Juncos and La

palma, and that the car remained parked for a period of

about

thirty minutes, after which two individuals, who

appeared to be male, emerged and went inside the building.

She pointed out that she subsequently associated the two

events since almost all the inhabitants in that building

are Cubans, and she has heard rumors that they are "trouble-

makers". She felt that perhaps some relationship existed

between the explosion and the arrival of the car shortly

thereafter,

and felt that perhaps inquiry at that address

might be productive.

on 8/13/74, CARLOS GARCIA-PEREZ, 753 Hipodromo,

santurce, Puerto Rico (above-described address), owner, The

Dress Shop (a factory and retail outlet) advised that he

rents the first floor of this building and part of the

second floor for his business, however, does not reside in

same.

He employs a tenant in his business, AMELA LEAL

when elected went against campaign promises and established promis
