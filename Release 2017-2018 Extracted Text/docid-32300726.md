AR

ROSSELLI still residing at his Los Angeles

apartment.

GEORGE SEEDMAN, Rowe Vending Company representative,

interviewed 2/21/63 and

though he was cooperative concerning

vending machine matters he claimed he was not acquainted with

ROSSELLI and had never heard of him.

It is recalled that

in latter part of 1962, LA 4268-C told ROSSELLI that he,

informant, might go to work for SEEDMAN and ROSSELLI wanted

informant to find out all about SEEDMAN's operations in the

vending machine line.

Both ROSSELLI and FRIEDMAN are Friar's

Club members but it is not known if SEEDMAN does, in fact,

know ROSSELLI.

on 1/22/63 toll call was made from room occupied by

MAHRICE H. FRIEDMAN and MICHAEL C. HELLERMAN at Beverly

Hilton Hotel, Beverly Hills, to telephone number 382-5222 in

Las Vegas, Nevada.

Las Vegas advised this number listed

to WILLIAM G. COULTHARD, an attorney who is former FBI agent

and who has been very friendly and cooperative with Las Vegas

Office in past. Las Vegas being requested interview COULTHARD.

Investigation conducted 2/21/63 revealed that the

present owners of the 1962 Chevrolet,

which ROSSELLI owned and

reportedly gave to a girl friend, purchased this car in the

latter part of 1962 from Lee White Rambler Dealers in Downey,

California, and that Lee

White Company purchased it in April,

1962, from

Brand Motors in Los Angeles.

It is noted that

ROSSELLI purchased his present car, a 1963 Ford I-Bird, from

Brand Motors in December, 1962.
