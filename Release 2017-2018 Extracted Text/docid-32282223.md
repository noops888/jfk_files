This meeting is complicated by a 14 May 1972 memorandum (which

is in your folder). It describeds the 7 May meeting in terms of

obfuscation, avoiding any discussion of "assassination." I view

this as clearly a cover memorandum -- Senator Church will probably

view it as an indication that Kennedy did not approve or know about

the assassination program.

Interesting Note: Helms recalls that the State Department had

a man engaged in a full-time effort to try and arrange a group to

take over the government of Cuba upon the assassination of Castro.

Post-1961 Specific Phase II Operations.

(1) On 18 April 1962 poison pills were delivered by CIA Dr

to Harvey to be sent into Cuba. Later memoranda indicate

that these pills were actually sent to Cuba. Additionally, memo-

randa indicate that the pills were "in place" ready for the attempt.

(2) Guns and explosives were given by Harvey and JMWAVE Chief

Shackley to Cuban asset Verona at a cost of $5,000.

(3) In June of 1962 and later in September documents indicate

that three-man teams were sent into Cuba by Harvey's operatives for

assassination

attempts. Indeed, in December 1962/ January 1963 a

$2700 payment was made by Harvey to Verona for expenses" of the

three-man teams.

(4) April/May 1963. Helms approves Harvey's meeting with

Roselli

as a kind of "close-out" of the Roselli relationship.

FBI has Roselli under surveillance -- calls Harvey and says they

must tell Hoover -- Harvey calls Helms -- Helms says no need to

brief McCone. Note: Senator Church may view this as another indi-

cation of Helms acting on his own.

(5)

In 1963 CIA'S TSD implements a

skin-diving suit with

poison and proposes a scheme regarding an exploding seashell.

Helms will say they were only wacky proposals by underlings which

never got anywhere. While this may be true as to the latter, the

skindiving suit/TSD must have had his approval -- TSD reports

directly to DDP.

(6) October 1963. Des Fitzgerald (now deceased) goes to

Paris to meet Cuban asset Cubella. Cubella wants to assassinate

Castro. Documents indicate that Helms tells Fitzgerald he may

use the Attorney General's name without seeking approval from

Kennedy.

(7) Circa November 22, 1963. Dr

Gunn of CIA prepares poison

pen which is delivered to Cubella in Paris. Documents unclear as

to whether Cubella accepts it or not.

(8) 7 March 1966. Helms sends memorandum to Secretary Rusk

denying Agency use of Cubella in assassination scheme... While Helms

may have a technical interpretation which makes the memorandum cor-

rect it doesn't disclose any of the CIA's contacts with Cubella.

Note: This again be used to argue no executive approval.

Prior to Helms formally becoming DDP on February 9 is the "first

recorded 'authorization' of ZRRIFLE Project; Helms gives written

on Harvey's general sign-off.

Both Edwards and Harvey stated in 1967 that they each independ-

Helms on the status of the castro operation. (He prated liar to be

The 1967 report states that Edwards' statement he "verified

Helms' approval to go ahead with Roselli and Harvey" is the earliest

indication that Helms had been made witting of the syndicate opera-
