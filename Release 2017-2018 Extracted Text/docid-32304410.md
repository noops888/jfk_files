Re: Ilando CAPOLINO - Brooklyn, N.Y.;

Guido CAPOLINO - Brooklyn, N.Yo;

Samuel (Sam) MANNARINO -

New Kensington, Pa.

In October 1965 our Prince George Detachment

in British Columbia received information from a confi-

dential source that the three captionally noted persons

met in the interior of British Columbia during September

23 to 25, 1965, using a hunting trip as a "cover".

According to information received, the two

CAPOLINO brothers arrived in Prince George, B.C. in

the pom. of September 16, 1905, via Canadian Pacific

Airlines from Edmonton.

They stayed in the frince

George Hotel during the night of September loth and

on either September 17th or l8th were flown by private

hunting lodge on Warwa Lake in

CAPOLINOs and

в.C.

Investigation has indicated that the hunter waiting

at Belcourt Lake may have been Samuel (Sam) MANNARINO of

New Kensington,

When the CAPOLINOs arrived, they

were varmly greeted by the nunter believed to be MANNAPINO.

These three persons then proceeded to remain in close

company for one and a half days and were observed to

engage in secret conversations, separate from other

persons in the hunting party.

The feeling was that the

CAPOLINOs and MANNARINO had pre-arranged this meeting.

The CAPOLINO brothers and MANNARINO departed company

on the morning of September 25th when they continued

on their separate ways to hunt big game.

Investigation in B.U

revealed that Sam MANNARINO

Pa., Albert HANNA of New Kensington, Pa.

hunting in the interior of B.C. during the

the CAPOLINOs were overheard to mention that the man they

net at Belcourt Lake was caught in the Apalachin Mountains

during a Mafia meeting.

This, therefore, led our investi-

gators to believe that the hunter met by

the CAPOLINOs was

Samuel MANNARINO.

Our records indicate that Samuel MANNARINO is

subject of your FBI #115840, born 1-Jan-06, Pittsburgh,

MANNARINO's last known address was 201 Highland

Apalachin

delegate.

Gabriel MANNARINO is

subject of your

FBI #854-850, our FPS #889382. Samuel MANNARINO, you will

recall, was

arrested by your Department in connection with

the Brockville Bank and Trust Company robbery in 1959-60.

During the present hunting trip in the interior
