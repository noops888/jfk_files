The Subject mentioned in paragraph 1 of Reference A, who was

reportedly arrested in late dune or early July 1965, is known to WAVE

as AMTURVY-13. The Subject mentioned in paragraph 2 of Reference A,.

who allegedly drew up the plans and reportedly received money and

special arms from PBPRIME is a former WAVE asset,

AMCROAK-1, who was

apparently arrested sometime in late April or early May 1965.

At the time of AMCROAK-1's recruitment in Madrid, Spain, in

December 1963, AMCROAK-I discussed a plan concerning the physical

elimination of GOC officials with the WAVE Recruiting Officer, see

Reference C.

During the course of this discussion the WAVE Recruiting

Officer learned that AMTURVY-13 was one of the principal conspirators

involved in the plot and that the plotters claimed to possess the

weapons and ammunition to perpetrate the dend.

All they required was

35,000 pesos in order to obtain a truck, two automobiles and places to

hide after the attempt was made. The WAVE Recruiting Officer told

AMCROAK-1 that ODYOKE did not condone such attempts and no commitments

were made to AMCROAK-1 insofar as ODYORE supporting the plot was

concerned. No weapons of any kind were ever sent to AMCROAK-1.

Upon returning to Cuba, following his recruitment, AMCROAK-1

submitted several persistent requests for funds to purchase two

automobiles.

Since AMCROAK-1 said in Madrid that two automobiles were

required

to carry out the plan mentioned in paragraph 2 above, it was

suspected that AMCROAK-1 was still involved in this matter.

Therefore,

he was told that WAVE would be willing to provide the funds for one

car for his operational use but not for two.

He was also told to

remember the discussions in Madrid, that we did not condone AMTURVY-13'ยง

proposed plans and he was instructed not to use AMTURVY-13 in any of

his operations in our behalf.

In an SW message dated 11 March 1964,

AMCROAK-1 responded that he had "forgotten about the AMTURVY-13 matter",

leading WAVE to believe that he had disassociated himself from

AMTURVY-13 and his proposed plot.

AMTURVY-13 was never mentioned

again in any correspondence received from AMCROAK-1.

Since that time

all of AMCROAK-l's messages contained positive intelligence and

operational matters only.

No further mention of AMTURVY-13 was ever

made in his messages.

However, in view of the information contained

in paragraph 2 of Reference A,

WAVE believes that this could be the

reason for AMCROAK-l's compromise. It is believed that AMCROAK-1 was

arrested because of his own indiscretion and because he did not heed

our instructions to keep away from AMTURVY-13.
