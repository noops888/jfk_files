BRIGADIER GENERAL FABIAN ( (ESCALANTE) ) FONT, PCC-CC, WHO

INITIALLY WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE VICE MINISTER OF THE MINISTRY OF

INTERIOR BUT LATER AS THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL

AFFAIRS, WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE MEETING. ESCALANTE SPEARS NETTHER

RUSSIAN NOR ENGLISH, THEREFORE REQUIRING A TRANSLATOR, ESCALANTE

SAID THAT HE IS THE NEPHEW OF ANIBEL ((ESCALANTE)), WHO WAS PURGED IN

1962, WENT TO MOSCOW, WAS REHABILITATED,

RETURNED TO CUBA, AND

FINALLY PURGED AGAIN IN 1968. ESCALANTE'S FATHER WAS A LEADER OF THE

INTEGRATED REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION (ORI).

(HEADQUARTERS COMMENT:

THE ORI WAS THE PRECURSOR OF THE PRESENT-DAY PCC.)

THESE POLITICAL

PROBLEMS WITH HIS RELATIVES DID NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR ESCALANTE, HE

SAID PROUDLY, BECAUSE CUBANS ARE ABOVE MAKING PEOPLE SUFFER FOR THE

FLAWS OF THEIR FAMILY.

AT THE TIME OF THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, ESCALANTE SAID THAT HE WAS

"HEAD OF COUNTERESPIONAGE OF A SECTOR" AND THEN EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS

CHIEF OF COUNTERESPIONAGE FOR THE U.S.

( SOURCE COMMENT: ESCALANTE

LOOKS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE HELD THAT POSITION IN 1961 OR, ALTERNATELY,

HE HAS BEEN VERY WELL PRESERVED.) ESCALANTE INDICATED THAT HE MADE A

PERSONAL RECONNAISSANCE MISSION OF CUBAN EMIGRE CAMPS IN CENTRAL

AMERICA IN OCTOBER 1960 AND DESCRIBED THE TRIP IN SOME DETAIL.

HE

ADMITTED THAT CUBA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A NUMBER OF UPRISINGS IN LATIN

AMERICA DURING THE 1960S AND THAT IT DID IN FACT INSTIGATE SOME

REVOLUTIONS WHICH NEVER QUITE GOT OFF THE GROUND, INCLUDING ONE IN

VENEZUELA. CUBA WAS NOT, HOWEVER, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAMOUS 1962

ARMS CACHE. CUBA DID SUPPLY THE SANDANISTAS, ESCALANTE STATED.

5 .

"INTERROGATING" ALL SUSPECT "CIA AGENTS" DURING THE 1960S.

ALONG

THESE LINES, ESCALANTE SAID THAT THERE WAS EXTENSIVE CUBAN

INFILTRATION OF U.S. ACTIVITIES IN MIAMI DURING THE 1960S, INCLUDING

THE MONGOOSE PROGRAM. WHEN ASKED HOW MANY CUBAN AGENTS WERE IN MIAMI

AT THE TIME, ESCALANTE SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW SPECIFICS.

IN FACT,

HE SAID, NO

ONE DOES BECAUSE CUBAN RECORDS FROM THE PERIOD WERE SO

HAPHAZARD. HOWEVER, HE STATED ASSURINGLY THERE WAS NO HIGH-LEVEL

CUBAN ASSET IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN 1962, ALTHOUGH HE QUALIFIED

THIS BY ADDING THAT HE HAS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF "POSITIVE

INTELLIGENCE" ACTIVITIES ABROAD.

ESCALANTE ADDED THAT HE BELIEVES

"SOME ELEMENTS OF THE CIA OPERATIONAL ARM" IN COMBINATION WITH THE

MAFIA WERE

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF U.S. PRESIDENT JOHN

F. KENNEDY.
