In the. Us as it has been pointed out that it may be the

reason for the cooling of the relationship between JAMES

and ANN LEE and the subject.

It has been reported in the past that non-Chinese

and particularly Americans, even though they are Communists,

are being avoided by Chinese Communists in order to

conform with the program to remove foreign influence from.

their movement.

This may alter completely the subject's position

in the US vis-a-vis the CP of China.

It is believed that the subject's trip in

December, 1966, may have been to determine what her posi-

tion and

course of action should be in

the US concerning

the cultural revolution.

Because of the limited number of the subject's

contacts and because they are almost exclusively pro-

hinese Communists and in the absence of sophisticate

overage of her activities, it is hoped that Ny 5225-

gain the subject's complete confidence and furnish
