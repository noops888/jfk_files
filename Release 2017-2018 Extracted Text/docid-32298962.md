A review of the investigation in this matter

discloses that on 11/5/67 confidential informant NO 1488-S

Mreported that well placed personnel with the United Fruit

Company, New Orleans, Louisiana, regard the subject as an

opportunist who probably cannot

be trusted. It was stated

that while subject has written articles lavorable to the

personnel of that concern with adverse publicity unless

the concern furnished him certain information he desired.

It was the consensus of opinion within the United Fruit

Company the subject cannot be trusted and he will use any

set of circumstances to gain information for his publication.

A Bureau SIS representative in the American Embassy,

San Salvador, El Salvador, on 5/1/43 reported to the Bureau

that Gaudet and one Richard Briggs, who were then with the

Office of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in San Jose,

Costa Rica, had acted in an indiscreet manner in discussing

in public places business natters which conversations vere

overheard.

Furthermore,

they disclosed to persons regarded

as almost strangers that a Bureau Agent was connectéd in an

undercover capacity with the American Embassy in Costa Rica.

It is further noted that subject has been involved

in two divorce proceedings; was sued on several occasions for

back alimony payments; was regarded in the past as a poor

credit risk; and in the late 1950's was a near alcoholic.

Accordingly, your request to designate Gaudet as

information.
