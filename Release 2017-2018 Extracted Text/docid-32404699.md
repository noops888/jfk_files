Following is the complete translation of the verbatim transcript.

TRANSLATION

A. I think we will speak in Russian.

You do not object?

B. No.

On the contrary, better in Russian, because in English I ((am))

no so ((sure of)) myself....

A. Over

the last three years, together with my colleagues whom you

already know and who have worked with you here -- ((those who))

questioned (doprashivali) ((you)), ((and those with whom)) you met

and became friendly, I also have taken an active part in your case.

B.

Yes.

A.

From the very beginning, as soon as your case had begun.

B. Unhunh ((affirmation of understanding)).

A.. And,

as you already have been told during the discussions and

the

investigation,

large part of what you have said cannot be accepted

as true (za chistuyu monetu) .

And one cannot accept that which you said in your statements

(pokazaniya), etc, in just the way that (tak kak) you said or

testified (rasskazyvali ili pokazyvali).

I think, therefore, that you understand this perfectly.

But, as far as the people who worked with you, questioned you, and

met with you ((are concerned)), all of them to some degree speak

Russian - some well, some not so well - ((but)) some do not know

the Russian language at all; it is the same in your case (tozhe

samoye s Vashey storony): although your English language is good,

still - quite understandably - there are some expressions and

words which are difficult to understand.

And, as for as all of the persons who worked with you before this

((are concerned)), perhaps they do not know or understand Soviet

reality very well....

B. That is correct.

A. ... And therefore, perhaps, for them

in some ((cases

it was))....

B. ((Interrupts)) Not understood what I am explaining.

A. Not wholly understood; perhaps it was understandable to them, but....

B. ((interrupts)) But not in detail.

A. Not in detail.

I am here only for that reason - in order to clear up all of

these misunderstandings which have arisen and existed.

I can tell you beforehand that at one time I worked in the KGB, in

Moscow, and lived there.

And I think that we, as former colleagues and former Soviets, will

try to find a common language in our discussion and to clear up

everything that was not understandable to us and everything that

was not understandable to you.

If you have sufficient courage and understanding of what I will say,

I think that we will find a common language and

finally we will

arrive at some common denominator; we will not leave a

single

puzzling question which would not have been answered or incorrectly

interpreted.

B. I agree with you absolutely.

I am wholly at your disposal.

A. Could you be precise?

B. I am ready to answer all questions.

It is another affair that everything I say, everything, is understood

((is viewed or treated)) from the position that it

is incorrect and

that I... so to speak, ((am)) false (fal'shiv.) and came with

definite assignment (opredelennoye zadaniye).

A. But how do you think - since, so to speak, you yourself have

already raised this question:

"They think that ((I am)) false, that

((I was)) sent with a definite assignment", etc. - how can you

yourself

answer:

Why

are you in such a position?

HOW

can you explain this yourself?

B. Absolute distrust... absolute distrust, and then I already have

been thinking to myself very much; it already ((has been)) a long

time (bol'shoy srok): 479 days today.

179 days - this is neither ((479)) hours nor minutes....

Here ((there is)) quite simply the deliberate - so, perhaps, to

speak - desire... the deliberate desire of the people (u lyudey):

to make a case that...

"Well, here a double agent (dvoynik) sits'

before us".

As if this were ((their)) aim, ((their)) task.

((It is)) not ((their)) aim-task (tsel' -zadacha) actually to know

the truth; but ((instead, it is)) their aim-task to make such a case.

A. Well, speaking in a friendly way, how do you consider ((this)) as a

counterintelligence (kontrrazvedka) officer?

Do you think

that

all of the people who worked with you have mis-

understood

you, etc., so much that - without reason and without

any basis (osnovaniye) -- they have held (("are holding" - derzhat))

you for more than 400 days?

As a counterintelligence officer, tell ((me)).

B. I can say only one thing: that I have said, I say, and I will say

until the end that I have conferred with absolutely no one; I have

not heard a single word from anyone regarding ((my)) travel (poyezdka;

here, ((and)) I shared with no one ((the thought)) that I want to

stay abroad and not return to the Soviet Union.

No one knew about this.

A.

Well, anyway, I think you still have not completely understood what

I said....

B. ((Interrupts)) About what?

A.

... About what I asked you.

What ("how" - kak) do you think?

There was and is some basis - do you consider

- for ((the fact))

that you were in such a position as you are now?

B. ... As I understood - the confusion of my explanations and....

Here, these moments, perhaps....

Then...

I do not know, I do not know.

I have, strictly speaking - I cannot say why, why, what is the

reason (("main point"

- sut')) .

I only know one thing - that they do not believe me.

A. You yourself mentioned the word:

"confusion of explanations"

(zaputannost' ob"yasneniy).

How do you explain this "confusion of explanations",

if you see such

a "confusion of explanations"?

B. I do not see special....

((you)) see - when I... and your colleagues who preceded you (s

predydyshchimi Vashimi kollegami) were talking together,

even they

said to me:

"This here is a lie (vot zdes' nepravdu); this here is

a lie".

But the point is not in how I said ((it)) (A, ne v etom delo, kak ya

skazal).

I said that "I took part"... "I did not participate".

The point is in that this fact took place or did not take place.

HH 53216 DocId: 32404699 Page 8

In this; I absolutely nowere, nowhere, made any mistake or lie.

A. As accounterintelligence officer, I think, you understand perfectly

that, having given (("said" - skazavshi)) one fact, a person must

say whence he knows this ((fact)), how this occurred....

B. Correct, correct.

Well, so you understand what (("thus, as" -- tak kak)) I say ((to you)

but how does it turn

out

(a chto poluchayetsya)?

For example, this Paris case; I tell them what (("as" - kak)) I know.

"From where do I know ((this", they ask me))?

"Nonsense, nonsense" ((they say)).

( (Laughs) )

How do I know?

"But these fellows... from IONOV's section (otdeleniye) told me

((I say)) .

"No. Not so" ((they reply)).

Well, I cannot say anything more.

I heard ((about this case)) only from them.

Or they supposed (predpolozhili) such a fact: From whom did I first

find out about DE JEAN?

So, believe me, believe me; I do not remember who ((was)) first,.

from where ((I)) first ((found out about this)).

First of all, working in the KGB - here, if you please, is the

problem: they do not believe me ((when I say)) that rumors, gossip,

etc., pass (khodyat) among the workers there.

You have worked ((there)); you know, if you worked ((there)), how

it is:

the First Department (otdel) has (('makes" - delayet)) a

case, but 10 departments (otdel) know that the First department is

doing something, something, ((although)) they do not know exactly

((what it is)).

But friends, those who have friends in the First Department, they

know a little more: that, ahah! ((there is)) a case against an

American, but they do not know the name ((of the American)).

A. I think that in this respect they understood you perfectly, and I do

not think....

B. ((Interrupts)) "No," they tell me, "This cannot be.

What you are telling us is nonsense."

A. Not in all cases was ((this)) so stated - that....

B. ((Interrupts)) And... believe me . well, how?

What kind of trust or distrust can ((there)) be, if they say to my

face: "You did not work in the First Section (otdel) of the First

Otdel ((during)) these years"?

I cannot say anything.

True (pravil'no), in the ABIDIAN Case, I did not look very good,

but I said so ((myself)), that I did not work on

it, did not conduct

his development (razrabotka); the file was charged

to me (delo za

mnoy chislilos').s

But how

was

it run?

So they surveilled ((him)), waited for ABIDIAN to show his tail

(khvost) .

They

do not believe me.

A. Well, about this....

We still will return to the case of ABIDIAN.

I know everything that you have said about ABIDIAN and so forth;

and, of course, as a former employee of the KGB, I never

in any way

can believe that you were the case officer for ABIDIAN.

B. I was not the case officer, I was deputy chief of the section....

A. The more so....

B.

((Interrupts)) And they thrust the case upon me, but this was

terrible mistake (("gross error" -- grubaya oshibka)), a terrible

mistake of the department, because it ((is)) necessary to sit and

work on ((a)) case.

A .

B. Yes.

A.

And possibly to clear up everything that...

B.

Everything which has not been understood there....

A :

Everything which has not been understood and so forth.

Let us suppose ((that there)) were very many questions ((about)) how

you began to work in the KGB, under what circumstances, etc.

I wish that we begin with (("from" --s etogo voprosa)) this question,

starting - for example - from the end of 1952 or the beginning

of

1953.

B. Good.

A. Thus we slowly will move further.

I have only one thing to discuss here; I hope that you will tell .

the truth: you will explain, corroborate everything that you say,

and so forth.

B. ((Interrupts)) I ask that you put the questions to me.

I will try to answer for you everything that you will ask.

A.

Also, ((be))

sufficiently accurate in your questions, etc., so that

there will be no misunderstandings of any kind....

B. ((Interrupts, repeating)) Misunderstandings.

A. To me, for example, ((this is)) not wholly understandable -- you

yourself know that in the course of

the long time you have been here

you

have said

several times that you went to work in the KGB - or,

as

it

was

called then, the MGB; one time you said ((this took place))

in 1952, sometime in the autumn or winter; then you said ((this took

place)) in the beginning of 1953; then you said ((it was)) after the

death of STALIN; and so forth.

B. (1G)

A.

Let us begin, even from the end of 1952;

we will not go into details

((about)) what was before 1952.

Let us begin from 1952.

Whence

and how did you show up (poyavilis') in the city of Moscow?

B. At the end of 1952 I arrived in Moscow from the city of Sovetsk,

Primorskiy Kray; this ((city)) is 10-15 kilometers from the city of

Baltiysk, formerly ((known as)) Pillau, ((a)) German ((city)) -= the

base of the Fourth Naval Fleet on the Baltic.

10-15 kilometers from this Baltiysk ((is)) the city of Sovetsk, where

my MRP - the Navy Intelligence Point (Morskoy Razvedyvatel'nyy

Punkt), at which I worked for several months in 1952 -- was located.

A. Good.

You arrived in Moscow from there.

When was this, and under what circumstances?

For what was it necessary for you to go to Moscow at this time?

B.

I had a purpose (tsel').

A purpose stood before me: having come to Moscow, having come to

Moscow, to try - either through the Ministry of the Navy, because

there still were twoministries at that time, ((the Ministry)) of

the Navy and the Military ((Army - Voyennoye - Ministry)), separately,

not together.

A. So.

B. To try to get out of (uvil'nut') the work at this MRP and to think

of something new to transfer (pereyti) ((to)) from ((this)) work.

Because this work absolutely did not suit me; I did not like it, I

did not receive any moral or other kind of satisfaction from this

work.

Here, at this point, I worked only several months in all.

A.

So.

B. I absolutely did not like this work.

And

I went to Moscow, went to Moscow;

I took leave (("got leave" --

dobilsya otpuska)) and went to Moscow.

I just took leave, so:

the MRP commander did not permit me ((leave)).

A. Well, in what, when was this, in what month did you arrive ((in

Moscow))?

B. In December, I arrived at the end of December 1952.

A. At the end of December?

B. Yes.

A. At the end of December 1952 you came to Moscow from

Sovetsk?

B. ((In a low voice, not confidently)) From Sovetsk, yes.

A. In plain language (prostym yazykov), explain to me what you did

(chem Vy zanimalis') ((during)) the first 3-4 days, when you had

arrived.

B. Well, I just cannot tell you this.

I have forgotten now.

I rested; I did not do anything.

A. I have in mind ((what you did)) as any officer ((does)); you were an

officer - I made ((this)) conclusion on the basis of your statements

(pokazaniya).

You came to Moscow, and so forth; well, alright (nu khorosho) -

you did not do anything, but the officer's duty demands ((that you))

come to someone and report that you have arrived in Moscow.

B. ((Interrupts)) Well, I did not come on ((an assigned)) business

trip (komandirovka) .

A. Upon instruction of some (V ch'ye-to rasporyazheniye)...?

B. ((Interrupts)) No.

A. ...On some kind of problems, etc.

You cannot just come, spit on everything and simply sit at home for

several months.

B. It is when you, ((when)) a person goes to Moscow on an ((assigned))

business trip (komandirovka), it is one case, but when a person goes

on leave (s otpusknym svidetel'stvom), on leave I can -- not having

reported to anyone - spend ((my)) leave, return on time and report

to the unit (chast') commander, to whom I reported ((when)) leaving,

report that I have arrived ((i.e., returned)).

A. Let us assume you went to Moscow; how much time was given ((for)).

your leave, a month or how much?

B. A month.

A. You went to Moscow; you do not report to anyone; you can live at

home, ((or)) wherever you wish, and so forth.

Good.

After three days, they announced a universal mobilization; what must

you do?

B. I must.

Here, in this case, I must quickly, quickly - well, here, taking

into account the work at the MRP, ((the fact)) that I am in Moscow

and ((that)) the Ministry of the Navy is located in Moscow -- I

quickly must telephone and say that

I am on leave: I am to go back

to the unit or there will be some kind of instructions from you.

A .

But, upon arrival in Moscow,

do you not have to register someplace?

And, if you wished to be a deserter and did not want - there is a

war, and you do not want to go to war, then how must they find you?

Here is the most simple routine question.

B. Well, in these events, you see, all military units immediately, you

know very well, in the

presence (v nalichii) (1G).

Say (('Give" - Davay)), he says, who of us is present, who is not....

Such and such officers

are not present.

Where

are they?

(CB; i.e.,

Subject's family name)) is in Moscow.

A. Please, we will not go into such details.

B.

You ((yourself)) asked for such details (("so" - tak)).

A. I think the question was completely clear: you have come to Moscow

on a month's leave; what must you do, who must know that you are on

leave?

The affair is not set up so that you,you understand, have come, and

you hang around for a month, and if there had been war, ((you would

have said)) I will go to report.

If it were so, there would have been a million deserters.

Because people are on the register somewhere, and they know them

and that he is here on leave, ((that)) this officer is here, and

so forth, and if he is needed, one can call him.

B. So, according to the regulations (po ustavu), any officer - in the

event of a declaration of war, in the event

of some kind

of critical

situation - quickly interrupts his leave and returns to ((his)) unit.

A. According to the regulations, it is that which is said in the

regulations which also will be written up in the plan for mobilizatior

and so forth....

He quickly interrupts his leave ?)

A.

...But apart from this, something else exists: some kind of rules,

which require that an officer do something upon arrival on leave in

any city of the Soviet Union, ((whether)) he goes home or he goes to

the Caucasus.

B. About this, where I will be on leave is known to the commander of

the unit, the military unit from which I departed,

and....

A. This is understood....

B.

Leave (otpusk), leave, and one goes

where?

Such

((and

such)) a city.

The Travel

documents (proyezdnyye dokumenty) are written out in

the railway ((travel)) order (trebovaniye na zheleznuyu dorogu),

again to that city where you are going.

A. Let us stop here on this, the most simple question.

Even here,

this little question: how did you go on leave (priyekhali

v otpusk)?

And what did you do ((during)) the first days?

With your documents, etc., where did you go, to whom did you report..?

B. ((Interrupts)) I did not report to anyone.

A. You have not explained articulately even to me.

B.

am explaining to you that I reported to no one.

A. The very same ((thing)) happened with all of the officers with whom

you have spoken previously (ran'she).

Sometimes

they

did not stop you, they gave you an opportunity, you

talked and

talked

and

talked.

But, believe

((me)), no one can buy ((it)) the way you say, that now

this

is how it

is.

Soviet reality does not work that way, and the registration (uchet)

is not carried

on (ne vedetsya) in this way, and people do

not travel

this way.

It is for this reason (Vot poetomu) that I am here....

B. ((Interrupts)) But I am

from there.

And I went.

I was there, then I came, and I was located there.

You understand me; you say that it is

not this way (tak i ne byvayet),

but I went through (perezhil) this, had ((this experience)).

A. For me, what you are saying is only conversation.

You can say as much as you wish....

B. I understand you, I understand.

A. But for me it is important and wholly necessary that you tell me

how this was.

You went to Moscow, and you say that you lived at home a month and

did not report anywhere to anyone....

B. ((With sarcasm)) You asked me what I did ((during)) the first days,

the first days.

A. You do not remember?

B. I told you, well, where - at home; I spent ((the time)) at home.

A.

Well, to whom ((did)) you - as soon as you had arrived from Sovetsk,

where did you go, to whom did you report?

B. I absolutely did not report to anyone.

B. We will stop on this ((point))....

How much time did you spend on leave, if you arrived ((in Moscow))

at the end of December?

How much time were you on leave, approximately, until what time?

B. I here... just.... it is hard to say.

Whether

my leave was finished, or maybe it was interrupted....

On leave in Moscow....

The business arose that I would be taken to work in the MGB.

Through KOBULOV, Bogdan... Zakharovich, and I in turn announced in

the Ministry of the Navy, in Personnel, to Colonel KALOSHIN, Chief

of Personnel of Navy

GRU, that I was processing (("am processing" -

oformlyayus')) and I would be (("will be" - budu)) processed (XG)

into the MGB:

"I am

announcing this to you."

A. Alright (khorosho).

Let us begin from here, since - I make my own conclusion - you were

not of a mind (ne v sostoyanii) or did not wish or do not wish to

explain

truly and correctly how you came to Moscow, to whom you

reported, etc.

Because there is no way to worm out of this (ni kak eto ni v kakiye

vorota), there is no way to get around it ((same expression)); do

not think, you, that you are the only person who has come here.

Many Soviet defectors come, many officers, and the rules which a .

person - a Soviet officer - must observe on leave are written in

his officer's identification (ofitserskaya knizhka).

Rule (("point" - punkt)) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

I even can imagine ((that it is)) not compulsory - and no one

insists - that one would come to Moscow and right away on the

second day must run ((to report)).

It happens (Byvayet) a person sits for three days, and....

B. Yes.

But (XG) ((A and B talk at the same time))

Or the military commissariat (voyenkomat), or the military commissaria

if this is a simple officer....

A. I do not want to put (postavit') "someone" ('kto-libo"), who did

you put when....

B. I did not put anyone.

When I had arrived, just after New Year's, after several days, I

went to (poyavilsya) the Ministry of the Navy.

Maybe after about ten days, seven, eight, and announced that I was

processing (("'am processing" - oformlyayus')); the problem of my

transfer from the system of the Navy to the system of the Ministry

for State Security was resolved (("'is resolved" - reshayetsya)).

A. Good.

Let us leave this question....

We still can return to this ((later)).

B. As you wish (pozhaluysta).

A. How, under what circumstances, and where did the conversation first

come up that you expressed the desire - or that someone proposed --

that you transfer to work in the organs....

B. Of the MGB.

A. Of the MGB.

B. It was at KOBULOV's dacha ((country house)) .

Prior to this, father knew - I had spoken with father previously

that I did not like this work.

More than that, when I left Baltiysk - I told you -- the unit

commander, the commander of our Navy Point, he of course did not

want to let me

go on leave, and I turned (obratilsya) - at a

reception to Commander of the Fleet Arseniy Grigor'yevich GOLOVKO,

father's pal (priyatel'), and said.....

A. We will return to this.

And we will come back to GOLOVKO and to the Chief of your Intelligence

Point, and

so forth...

B. No, as I....

A. We have begun now to talk ((of)) how and under what circumstances --

so, not upset, calmly, simply - they found you, you found a person

with whom

to

talk of

going to work in the MGB.

B. While a guest, with my father and mother, at KOBULOV's - it was on

the first or second of January at his dacha.

The conversation was brought up: "And what are you doing?"

I said what I was doing (("am doing" - delayu)), where I was working

(("am working" - rabotayu)).

A. One minute.

"The conversation was brought up: 'What are you doing?!"

I have one question here.

Why did you and your family happen to be at KOBULOV's dacha?

B. ((Smiling)) There was a phone call.

At this time, KOBULOV was working in the GUSIMZ, GUSIMZ system.

But maybe it was as cover ((that)) he was registered with (chislilsya)

GUSIMZ, as Deputy Chairman.

GUSIMZ -- that is, the Chief Directorate of Soviet Property Abroad

(Glavnoye Upravleniye Sovetskim Imushchestvom Zagranitsey).

But he had been in Berlin, as chief of "BISMUTH" ((Soviet mining and

development concession, "Wismut"; in Russian, Sovetskoye aktsionernoye

obshchestvo 'Vismut')) -- all uranium extraction (("development" -

razrabotka; mining and

processing)).

And he was in Moscow.

He knew father.

Well, they, many knew.

He rang up father; for what, why, I do not know; in any event, he.

invited ((us)); or maybe father invited him to ((visit)) us at our

dacha, but he ((KOBULOV)) said: "I cannot; no, better, perhaps,

((if you come)) to me".

Well, all in all, we went as guests,

for a few hours (1G), to

KOBULOV's dacha.

A .

((In English)) Well.

I think you must say a little more:

SESHET

what - had ((your)) father

and KOBULOV known each other long, or had you and KOBULOV known each

other long?

It does

not happen

so simply; if I, for example, do not know KOBULOv,

I cannot ring him up:

"Please come to ((visit)) me!"

B. (?One minute; I will explain to you now?)

Father had

worked, so to say, in such posts since 1938.

He knew the Minister or Deputy ((Minister)) from any Ministry.

KOBULOV also had worked for many years as a Deputy Minister and

also was among the "higher-ups" all the time.

But they know each other ((2G - A and B speak at the same time.))

A. You understand that it is not important that your father had worked

in the Ministry of Ship-building or some other Industry; specifically,

this - I would say - had no relation of any kind to the NKVD, where

KOBULOV at one time was Deputy Minister.

Here there must be something linking their friendship, something

further on which it was built, either a simple acquaintance or as...

B. ((Interrupts)) I understand.

A. It could not have heppened just so, that he phoned and (i vot)....

B. ((Interrupts)) They meet at receptions, they meet at conferences, thes

know each other, then perhaps they run into each other on problems;

so to say; there were some kinds of common problems.

Let us assume, for very many years the MVD carried on construction;

the most secretsand most complex ((construction work)) they carried

out with the MVD troops (silami voysk MVD›: SPETSSTROY .

Perhaps on this ground; I do not know on what ground they are

acquainted, but they are acquainted, and they have known each other

for a long time.

And not only ((that)); father knew many, many, just as

those who

were working "at the top (naverkhu)" knew him.

A. Let us begin from this.

They knew many, etc. -- this is another question.

I wish to establish here only what mutual relations there were between

your family and the KOBULOVs and why it happened....

B. ((Interrupts)) Before this....

A.

...that you happened to be at KOBULOV's dacha, at a party and at

dinner or who-knows -what.

B.

Before this ((period)), I do not remember that our families were

associated,

so to say.

KOBULOV's family or our family - I do not remember

such a question.

They knew each other:

KOBULOV and father.

Well, they addressed each other by first name: ((father addressed

KOBULOV as)) Bogdan, ((and)) he addressed father -- Ivan.

Such ((was their form of)) address.

But by families I do not remember; there was no such event before

this.

Maybe, maybe, before New Year's they saw each other somewhere: in

the Kremlin, at a meeting, somewhere; and maybe therefore Bogdan

KOBULOV telephoned to congratulate ((father on New Year's)).

It is customary, you see: ((for)) New Year's, some congratulate on

the thirty-first, ((those who)) who are not visiting (kto ne v

gostyakh), who are at home; some send telegrams, but this is to

((those in)) other cities; but some call even on the first, phone

around to

their acquaintances.

Well (Vot), perhaps KOBULOV phoned, because I remember that there was

a call, namely, from KOBULOV.

KOBULOV himself phoned and congratulated father: "((I congratulate))

you on the New Year, Ivan; well, what are you doing?"

"Nothing much; the family is ((just)) sitting here; maybe we can get

together and have a drink."

A. But are you saying exactly how it was, or are you imagining and

presenting....

Despite the fact that mother also knew KOBULOV's wife, exchanged

greetings with her - "Good day (Zdravstvuyte)".

She saw ((her)) at a parade or reception or in a shop of the Council

Then, you see, the fact is that my acquaintance, VAKHRUSHEV, was

married to KOBULOV's daughter, and ((Pauses)) ....

A. We will return to VAKHRUSHEV, also.

Today, I want only one thing - ( (that it be made)) clear and

understood what kind of mutual relations there were at that time

((between)) KOBULOV's family and your family and ((between)) you

There was no one time, either at his apartment or at his dacha.

Well, you do something.

I was - I do not remember - I had come in either civilian clothes

or

uniform; I do not even remember.

The conversation about

me simply arose (zashel):

What was 'I doing?

Where

was

I working?

Perhaps

Vasiliy raised the question, because Vasiliy had studied at

the same institute as I, only he - VAKHRUSHEV - had graduated two

years

earlier.

I said

that I was working in the GRU system of the Ministry of the

Navy.

In the beginning, my work (pervonachal'naya moya rabota) - work in

the Far East - satisfied me.

The work here - several months on the Baltic - absolutely did not

satisfy (("'does not satisfy")) me, and I have, I came here not so

much for the sake of leave, but took leave in order to think of

something, to find something, a place for work to which to go.

Well, Bogdan Zakharovich was interested.

There father and I were sitting (("sit")); there sat Vasiliy and

Amayak; I do not remember whether or not mother was listening.

I said this and that, this and that (to, to, to, to).

"But what are you doing?"

I told what kind of work, the preparation of so-called ANPS --

Agent-Surveillance Posts (Agenturno-Nablyudatel'nyye Posty) -

against the event

of war in the future.

"Well, that's

all.

Well, I even do not know exactly how he said ((it)).

I cannot tell you word for word.

I cannot tell you word for word.

He suggested to me: "How do you view work in the organs ((with

uncertainty)) of Security?"

((I replied,)) "Excuse me, I do not know this work, and ((Pauses))

I have not worked ((there))."

A. Do you remember exactly how and what he said or not?

B. No, I do not remember word for word; no, no, no.

The conversation came up; he said to me: "How do you view work here?"

I said to him that "I do not know; if it is interesting work, then

((I will accept it)) with pleasure."

A. He said the word, "here", or....

There was no talk of intelligence or counterintelligence, absolutely

none (absolyutno ne bylo), and I -- until the beginning, until I

began work in March - I did not even know where I would (("will"

I did not know.

A .

I, of course, would not have wanted to remind you that, for example,

earlier you said, for example, that when they questioned you in 1964

you

explained about KOBULOV a couple or three times before this, etc.;

at two points (("'in two places" -- v dvukh mestakh)) you emphasized

straight out that KOBULOV had said to you:

"And how about work in

counterintelligence,

in the organs of counterintelligence?"

B. I do not remember the word, "counterintelligence"; I do not remember

the word, "counterintelligence".

He could have said only one ((thing)):

work on foreigners,

Or

against foreigners, or on foreigners.

He could have said that.

But the word, "counterintelligence", I do not remember.

But, you understand, working in counterintelligence, I of course

could have said this.

A. You must understand that this is a very important moment.

B. I absolutely do not understand this.

It means I am so

stupid that I consider this absolutely not the

important moment you say it to be (kak bylo skazano) .

It is absolutely not important ((whether)) it was

said "in the

Ministry of State Security (V Ministerstve Gosbezopasnosti)",

because ((B's family name)) wished to work, or "you will work in

the organs

of State Security (v organakh gosbezopasnosti)," or "you

will work in State Security (v gosbezopasnosti)".

It is, you know, one ((and the same)) Ministry.

work, in intelligence or in counterintelligence.

What else (("'further" - dal'she))?

B. Well, I understood him, that he has broad connections at his disposal

"Do not worry about this.

They will do it; this will be the work of Personnel ((Department)),

I asked: "But will you set it for me

or

not?"

I do not

remember what he answered, but

to my mind he said,

"It is not your affair; they will handle this without you."

For all that, I soon, soon - well, maybe after several days

-- in

the Ministry of the Navy, I told about this (ob etom fakte).

A. This conversation, then, took place on the first or second of

January 1953, with KOBULOV at his dacha?

to the courtyard (a vkhodik vo-dvor), a grille (reshetka), an iron

grille; you enter the courtyard, here ((is)) the fifth ((entrance)) --

I never (("not once" - ni razu)) entered the fifth; the sixth

entrance - I went in the sixth, it ((is)) FINO, there, concerning

money and travel documents; the seventh entrance - whether I was

there or not I do not even remember; the eighth entrance - this

here is the last.

Well, then, here ((are)) the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth - the

last - ((that is)) all.

There are no more.

This is in one small courtyard (dvorik).

That ((is)) all of the entrances of Builging 12.

A. Well, where is the ninth?

B. There is no ninth.

I simply said (("say" - govoryu)) the eighth or the ninth.

This entrance is the eighth.

Because here from this

side the fourth ((is the)) last, opposite

Building 2, but here i around the corner -- there is the entrance

to the courtyard and these entrances: fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth.

I cannot in any way imagine that a person who has worked for 10 years

in counterintelligence can say, could try to state to a person who

worked at the ninth entrance that there is no ninth entrance.

I cannot in any way understand this.

B. I do not know, I do not know, I do not know, I do not know.

I am telling (Ya govoryu) ((you)) what I know....

A. Listen, a person who has worked so many years probably knows how

many entrances ((there are)) in Building 2 and in Building 12.

B. I say that ((there)) is not.

There cannot be a ninth entrance there, because further on behind

this building is (('goes" - idet}) the Moscow Oblast and Moscow City

Directorate (Upravleniye Moskovskoy Oblasti i Goroda Moskvy) ((of

State Security)).

((That is)) all, and there is nothing more.

A. Correct, but where is the ninth entrance.

B. I do not know where the ninth ((is)).

There is no ninth.

I do not know the ninth entrance, because, right away, you see,

this small courtyard, so, the iron grille, the end, this little

courtyard ends here, here a part - the restaurant comes out here

onto Lubyanka

and just (srazu zhe) after the restaurant, it comes

up nearby, here it is as Building 12, a continuation of Building 12,

Let us begin a little further back (nemnozhko nazad), with the

B. There is (Vot) a little window (okoshechko).

I gave ((them my)) officer's identification (("officer's booklet" -

I said that there is a pass (propusk) for me.

They

But, as usual, they take your document, close the little window, and

you wait.

The little window opens, the officer's identification is returned

with the pass, the pass.

In the pass it is indicated, then, Building 12, the entrance, such-

TO ROZHENKO:

B. No, no.

The pass was made out, room such-and-such six hundred... there, to

do not remember exactly.

Whether there was shown (ukazano) a name (familiya) - ((it)) must

be shown, but I do not remember - I do not remember, I do not

I came to this - I remember, then, that when I came to this room,

I went up; I went in the eighth entrance, went up... wait, where did

I remove ((my coat))?

I took off ((my coat)) here, downstairs (vnizu); correct.

Below (Vnizu), at the eighth ((entrance)), I removed ((my coat)),

went up, knocked at ((the door to)) this room, and there sat several

people: three or four, all in civilian clothes.

They said, "Wait."

Alright (khorosho), I wait.

((There are)) two places . two cloak-rooms.

And when you go to eat at the dietetic restaurant (dietstolovaya),

you wear your coat to the second floor, where you remove ((it)).

If you go up

"(above the

then

you remove ((your coat)) here, below.

I removed ((my coat)) below, on the first floor, as I entered.

A. What ((was)) there, cloak-room attendants, man and woman (garderob-

B. Yes, there was

a woman, a cloak-room attendant.

A. You went up.

Then (Dal' she)?

B. I went up to the floor indicated in the pass,

knocked, opened ((the door to)) the room; there, I, well -- as far

B. ((Interrupts)) But I will explain to you.

I will tell you - why?

Because I do not remember, I do not remember.

But usually it is shown

who orders the pass.

An ordinary case officer or a senior case officer cannot order a

pass; that is, he can write out the pass, but someone among

his

superiors (iz rukovodstva) signs ((it)).

Now, you have issued it, but still you must confirm if the deputy

chief

of Department (otdel), the chief of Department, signs it by

hand (v pis mennon vide) - that is how it is (vot tak).

Now, orally (v ustnom vide), the officer, now, here now....

A. We will come back to this: the pass procedure (Is poryakok propuskov),

etc.; we will talk more of this.

B. That is why I am here (Dak i ya).

You ask me; I explain to you.

A.

I am talking to you about this case.

I cannot believe that a person has worked for so many years and

does not know exactly whether the name of

the employee whom

he was

visiting

(k kotoromi on idet) was shown on the pass

He goes up to the sixth

floor and says:

Or

not.

"Who needs ((B's surname? ))'

B. No, not to the sixth floor, but to room six hundred... such-and-such

and there

some room six hundred (XG) ... I ((am)) ((B's surname)) and..

I have appeared (yavilsya), I do not know to whom to speak (obratit'sy

who was sitting there, I do not know who, to whom must I turn

(obratit' sya) .

To my thinking, tomy thinking, to my thinking, a name was shown

there in the pass... I do not remember; let us suppose ((that the

name)) there ( (was)) PUSTYSHKIN, PODUSHKIN.

I could have opened ((the door to)) the room and said: "My name is

((B's surname)); who here is Comrade PODUSHKIN or PUSTYSHKIN?"

He ((would have)) said: "I ((am he)); you wait for me; I will call

you."

immediately can say that a name is shown there or is not shown.

He will not hesitate, think up ((something)), and say: to my thinking,

it was, or it was not; because the regulations (pravila)....

With this, everything

the last phone call I received from

I was, I was, this period of time, you understand, all January -- I

still ((had)) leave, February and this part of March before working,

time, I was

but how it was here, no one explained to me.

I know only one ((thing)) - that Personnel of GRU, GRU of the

Ministry of the Navy, knew that it will be handled (provoditsya)

that... the problem of my enrollment in the MGB is resolved; they

knew

that this question

is decided and therefore put me

at the

disposal of Personnel; that is, this so useless (boltayushcheyesya)

position which is before the moment

of

assignment (naznacheniye).

It can be two and three

months or a month

or a half-month or four

months.

A. How did the Personnel Department of Navy GRU find out that you were

processing (("'are processing" • Oformlyayetes')) for work in the MGB?

In January.

I told ((him)) in January.

Maybe on the 10th, maybe on the 8th;

I do not remember when

I was

there first.

I told them that I was processing... the question of my, of my

enrollment, of taking me to work in the Ministry for State

Security

is decided..

Because that work to which you sent me last time in Sovetsk, at the

Fourth... at the MRP of the Fourth Naval Fleet, does not suit me at

all, because this work (eto rabota) (1G) .

A. And what did you do for KALOSHIN at that time, when you stated

that....

B. I did not do anything.

I said that, in all probability, as far as I understood, they will

put you in the know officially somehow.

This they themselves already ((had done)) .

And, really, no one had told me, and, really, they already had put --

I have in mind the MGB Personnel (kadry MGB) - they officially had

put the GRU Personnel of the Ministry of the Navy in the know, but

they quickly asked about this, "give ((us)) the personal file

(lichnoye delo)", that no one had explained to ((or)) showed ((or))

told me, but GRU Personnel (kadry GRU), KALOSHIN, knew officially,

KALOSHIN

already knew, not from me, but GRU Personnel knew officially

that the question

about me is resolved in MGB Personnel (v kadrakh

MGB), and

they put me officially at the disp((osal))..., I became,

then, not as an officer of the MRP of the Fourth Naval

Fleet in

Baltiysk, in Sovetsk, but ((an officer)) at the disposal of

Personnel (v rasporyazheniyem kadrov), at the disposal of Personnel..

A. But you remember that... I again return to the old problem that

obscurities arise, of course more, not from ((our)) understanding

each other, but you said earlier what you are saying now,

it is

true that

earlier - one or two times - you said that you had

filled out the questionnaire (anketa) at ROZHENKO's, etc.,

but

there was a time (moment) when you said that they told you

in the

Personnel Department (otdel) of the MGB that "it ((is)) not necessary

fill out any kind of questionnaire (anketa), we have requested

your personal file (lichnoye delo)."

B. And wholly understandably; it may be that I ((did)) precisely ((that))

the second time, because - I am sitting and thinking, but why ((did))

I ((do so)) the second time - perhaps they gave me a questionnaire

the second time....

I do not remember, do not remember.

A.

Understand me; Counterintelligence (Kontrrazvedka) does not work

that way.

When a person has worked in Counterintelligence and tries to explain

and state that white is black and black, white, of course it is

difficult for the people who have been talking with you -- including

me - to believe that you are telling how in fact it was.

When a person once has said that "it ((is)) not necessary to fill

out anything, we have requested your personal file", and that is all

(i konets); now, in order to find an answer, you are trying somehow

to explain: "Maybe it was so the first time, but perhaps, the

second time."

I want to know the truth, in order that it be clear and definite

that you went to ROZHENKO, that you filled out a questionnaire, what

you did, etc., or it was that they requested your file from the GRU

and you did absolutely nothing there.

Because you told ((it)) one time thus, and then two times in another

way.

The truth must be somewhere, because it cannot be this way.

B. I am telling you the truth as it is; I was ((there)), I talked in

Personnel two or three times, I filled out a questionnaire, I filled

out a questionnaire; when did I fill out the questionnaire?

Whether they gave it to me right away or gave it to me later,

gave it to me - I do not remember, I do not remember, I do not

Absolutely.

I know

I filled out two

submitted

A. But why (("for

two questionnaires?

B. Uh, two copies.

A. Why?

B. I do not know.

A. Here, of course, in this event....

B. ((Interrupts)) Well, then, where;

it is in the personal file

him, but what is there; a personal file, but there is also an

insert

(vlozheniye) in the personal file, the special check (spetsproverka)

file,

which also is kept (khranit'sya) here

in the personal file, but

it ((can

be)) taken out.

It is, there is such

a folder (korochka), the special check file is

sewn into the folder.

Probably here (Navernoye syuda) .

A. To you, of course, every mortal man knows that there is a special

check file in the personal file, because without a special check they

do not take you into

the MGB, but it also is true that even when new

employees are taken on (dazhe pri postuplenii vnov' prinimayemykh)

they do not fill out two copies of the questionnaire.

B.

..And later I filled out two more copies.

It may be that you could have filled out one copy later, one more

after a year, perhaps another after five years, and so forth, but

the Personnel Department needs only one good copy and absolutely

nothing more is needed.

B. Two copies.

I married, my wife, they gave two copies again

for completion on

my wife (dlya zapolneniya zheny).

A. We will be talking about this when we come to this marriage, and

we will return to this questionnaire.

I want you to understand what I am saying.

The next question - of which I had not wanted to remind you -

((concerns the fact)) that the questionnaire both for new employees

(vnov' prinimayemyye) and for KGB employees (sotrudniki KGB) is not

given to ((be taken)) home.

The biography, yes; you can write as much as you wish, even ten. "

The questionnaire is not given . and not because of distrust of a

Communist or of an employee - but only because it may be lost.

This is the only reason.

B. It may be.

It all may be.

But I took ((it)) home, and not ((just)) one time -- ((my)) wife

also filled ((it)) out at home.

A. When

you had begun work, later, this also must not be, but the

possibility is not excluded, that ((then)) you took ((it home)) -

I do not object to this so much; but when you had come for the first

time only and that they would have given ((it)) to you ((to take))

home - this question is completely ruled out.

Here is what I want to understand - you have told me that you took

((it)) or you did not take ((it))?

I do not remember, and I do not know.

B. But I know that I filled out a questionnaire... and wrote an auto-

biography... to my thinking, I wrote this

at home, because I had,

B. I cannot help you - forgive me, please, forgive me - I cannot

help you, because I answer thus as I know, what I know, but you

A. ... I do not at all need anyone's help....

B. I understand.

You know your business.

A. I need only the truth.

The fact was and is that the questionnaire is not given ((to be

taken)) home.

You told me that you took it home.

I can in no way understand this.

I simply want to hear only one ((thing)) from you -- that you tell

me that "I filled ((it)) out" either here or not here; if "I took

((it)) home" - ((then you)) took ((it)) home; but they do not give

((it to be taken)) home; then you wrote it somewhere else?

B. In that or another event, I filled it out immediately, or, after I

was accepted, I filled it out at home.

In that or another event.

Only at home; the first questionnaire which was completed by me for

the MGB ((wife filled out)) only at home.

B. Well, it ((matters)) little that it could not.

I waited a little and then I decided simply to say that it does not

happen so (ne byvayet tak).

You could have answered

me: "Perhaps at home, perhaps in the office,'

etc., but you are trying to state that ((it was)) definitely at

home.

Then I, knowing that this is not done at home, you must give me some

kind of foundation ((for)) why, why

this was so.

B. Why at home?

I can give the grounds

- because I even do not remember, mother,

this about relatives, and my mother, she was studying in the courses,

in the courses, in the period when she met father, in the courses,

but for the life of me; and then I do not remember what years she

was studying, where, what.

As concerns father, I know where he worked, there in Leningrad, the

street, the plant, such and such years, but I do not remember the

details about mother; therefore, I, I remember well that I filled

out the questionnaire at home.

I asked mother, "But how ((shall I)) put ((about)) you here?"

... "

A. I agree with this completely.

More, I can tell you - if you do not know or, perhaps, do not wish

to say; there is no secret about this, the whole world knows about

it - for the person

who fills out a questionnaire for the first

time for the KGB, it is rather difficult:

there is quite a number

of questions about both mother and father, etc., ((the answers to))

which the son perhaps does not know at all....

B. And absolutely does not know.

And therefore I say....

A. This is done in the majority of ((such)) cases - the person sits,

reads the questionnaire, ((sees)) approximately what kind of questions

((there are)), and then collects the information from his father,

mother, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, or ((about)) who ((ever))

else there was or was not, and then he comes the next time and

A .

What then..?

B. ((Interrupts)) One minute; I do not remember, but I do not remember

exactly whether this Personnel man (kadrovik) gave me the questionnair

to fill

out.

((But)) then what did I hand over to him?

I remember I went over, rang him up, I gave him some documents.

And at that time, you understand, I have recalled another detail,

when I already had begun work in March, on the first day I came

SHUBNYAKOV talked with me; SHUBNYAKOV rang up GORBATENKO; GORBATENKO -

acting chief of the department (otdel) - took me tó his office, and

that day or the next the Personnel man (kadrovik) who previously was

in the Second Chief Directorate (vo Vtorom Glavke) - the one, the

Personnel man, who previously had been assigned (chislilsya) as an

officer of the Second Directorate (Vtoroye Upravleniye) - phoned me.

He called me ((to come)) to his office (("to himself" - k sebe)),

here on the sixth floor in Building 2, the corridor, and gave me

the questionnaires and ((Without certainty)) the biographies to fill

out.

It may be that I am confused here; maybe I did not fill out anything

for Personnel there, but what I filled out - what I am remembering -

is that which I received from SAKHAROV .

Well, I cannot say.

I am afraid of tangling myself up, etc.

A. Of course, it is possible to believe what you have said -- that it

happened the second time, etc. - but, you see, I do not want to

make any assumptions; you are a smart enough fellow and, having

thought for some time and with some leading questions, I think ((you

A. Well, let us begin before the beginning (pred nachalom), when you

say that your father was a Minister and, of course, was in the

Kremlin many times, etc., and probably was at conferences (soveshchani

STALIN's death, as they say, ((was)) a very great moment in the life

of the whole Russian or Soviet people.

They remember all of this well, how it happened, etc.

Let us

take

starting point before the death and at the time of

the death ((of STALIN)).

When

did

you first hear that STALIN ((was)) ill or that he ((was))

dead?

B. No.

((In an agitated voice)) It was announced that he ((was)) seriously

ill, that, it was announced even in the press and by radio that he

((was) ) ill....

your father or from someone in higher circles that he ((was)) ill.

or something in this regard?

B. You understand how it ((was)) (Vy ponimayete v chem delo), literally

It happened at night.

heard ((of it)) from father, well, then from father's circle

(okruzheniye) there and...:

A.

I am asking only that question; we will not talk ((of)) then ((when)),

of course, there were many conversations afterward: of when he

became ill, of when his stroke (udar) seized him, and so forth.

This was after everything already had become known; I am speaking

now of

before STALIN's illness; let us take ((for example)) the end

of February or the beginning

of March.

What

did you as a member of the family of a highly-placed person,

B. Well, could we not have heard ((of this)) from anyone.

It happened with him at night.

In the morning it already had been announced by radio that he had

a stroke (udar).

A.

Then I must make the conclusion that, before it was announced by

radio or in the newspapers, you had not heard from anyone of his

illness?

B.

No.

No, but I heard of his illness of some kind (o yego kakoy bolezni),

of this illness -- no.

I had heard that he ((had been)) rather (kakoy-to) strange of late,

((that)) he did not receive anyone; I had heard this.

A. Alright.

Let us come back to this: he was rather strange, he did not receive

anyone.

Approximately when did this happen?

No, no.

You see how it was, from where I had heard?

Well, I had heard such things from father, from father and from

father's group (okruzheniye otsa) -- MALYSHEV, VANNIKOV, KHRUNICHEv,

OKOPOV - "Of late, 'The Boss (Khozyain)' is not receiving anyone;

he is a little strange, he has changed, he has changed extremely

in recent years".

Well, here was in mind, I have in mind 1952, 1953, because in 1950 -

1951 I was not ((there)), I do not know, I was gone (ya byl v

(1G) I have heard of strangeness (strannosti) of such a type, that

he was working (perenes rabotu) all night and in the morning, but

during the day, generally, they rarely see him, and he does not

permit ((anyone)) to approach him, and it is rare that one sees him.

At that, from my pal - Leonid PETROV, that is - I heard

a little,

other details of ((STALIN's)) personal life, how he acts.

A. But who is this PETROV?

took in this Doctors' Plot and ((the case of)) the

I do not know ((whether)) it is interesting or not interesting.

When I came, when I had

arrived - here is what is interesting -

SHUBNYAKOV phonedne, he talked with me, he phoned GORBATENKO,

GORBATENKO talked with me, and

this very day I saw the Chief of the

First Department - that is, you understand, he still was assigned

((chislilsya), but was not working, then was not working, as Chief

of the First Department - Colonel KOZLOV, Anatoliy Sergeyevich.

A. Everyone in the world knows him (Yego vse znayut, vo vsem mire);

we do not need to talk about him (ne sleduyet o nem razgovarivat').

B. No, here, he took part on the Doctors' Plot (v dele vrachey) ; he

took part; they sent (brosili) him to the Special Investigative,

Investigative Unit (chast') for Especially Important Cases; they

sent (brosili) him for (na) the Doctor's Plot, and he took what

part?

They called up all these doctors who had been arrested and persuaded

them to give testimony (pokazaniya) that everything that they had

said before this was untrue, that this was taken only by beating "

(tol'ko bitvem), that they had told

lies (nepravda).

And the poor doctors did not know whether to tell lies now or to

tell the truth.

A. But finally they agreed to tell the truth.

B. In general, they convinced the doctors to admit that the previous

testimony had been incorrect.

It was in

this that KOZLOV took part.

And therefore I

said, when GORBATENKO, his Chief of Department

(yego nachal'nik otdela), because KOZLOV continued to be assigned

(chislit'sya) as Chief of the Department....

But, TIMASHUK, then, I heard that they took back the Order of Lenin,

that it ((the case)) was "manufactured (dutoye)".

TIMASHUK was an agent.

A.

But not only heard.

had been taken away from her.

A.

But that... you mentioned SAVCHENKO; what was

During

B. They were, in order, in IGNAT'YEV's time, they were, in order,

SAVCHENKO, RYASNOY, Chiefs of the First Directorate, the Intelligence

Directorate (Upravleniye Razvedki).

SAVCHENKO was ((Chief)) at one time; before this, SAVCHENKO had

worked in the Ukraine, but here, in Moscow, in Moscow, he was Chief

of the first Directorate (Upravleniye Pervoye).

He was ((Chief)) at one time; then, one time, RYASNOY.

Then RYASNOY was Deputy, then RYASNOY was Chief of the Moscow

Directorate (Moskovskoye Upravleniye).

That is what I heard (Vot takoye, takoye, slyshal).

A.

What happened to RYASNOY later?

B. He was retired (V otstavke on).

He was retired, on pension, and did not work anywhere.

Why do I know?

Because I was living at the dacha of one of the colleagues with

whom KOVSHUK worked; the dacha was

near RYASNOY's (dacha byla ryadom

S RYASNYM) .

A. But what of SAVCHENKO?

B. SAVCHENKO (A SAVCHENKO) ....
