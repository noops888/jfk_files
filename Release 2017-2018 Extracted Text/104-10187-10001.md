Delor (INSCRIVENESS) •

BIGES

Perational - As noted in the previous leguest for Project Roneval,

tie fomor LINITED property was sold to Lucushs, who as per foral auree-

west with the Station, denolished the oid atructure and constructed a new

edifice.

While it wis initially conte plated to piece the LIVED

(rapiys band 7) personnel In the new building and to retaln the sane,

eusl division of wortload between LILYRIC anu LEATED, it wus later

deviued to move the present LILYiLIC basenouse personnel (LICETIC-13, -14,

26 and -27) Into the new bago intead, along with the followins ancillary

naticationai

An Increase in the hours of both the pliotographic ad physical aurvelliance

coverage provided mon the new baco by the LILYRIC oporatora (0000-1600

hourg) during the weekdays and to have the LiNITED base provide

photoraphic and pusical curveillance coverase fros 1600-1930 hours'

on weekdays and fion 0900 1300 hourg on weokerls. These changes were

dictated by the followini considerations:

1.

The now LNICUSIT building offers a uuch better vantage point

for both photosraphic and physical curveillanco than does the

present complex which houses the LILINIC Mia LINIIDD hases.

Therofore, the Station ielt that the persomel occupying thia

new base should be thodo possessing the highest techrical skilla

and also those able to provide the cost thorough and complete

covorage.

Since the LITTED base now has only one treined

operator while the LInIC bacchouse has three, the LIlyuc croup

and a revision of horking houro was Indicates.

2. Jecause it was apparent that the coveraso of the LIfTiCK

Installation would be a long rance and continuing reguiresent,

tio Station desired to steff the new base with personnel 0f long

range potential. LIMPTY-S, now alrost 60 jears old, does sot

possess this potenticl; horever, the LILYnIC ajent complex

happily cosbines experienced personel vith youthrul agents.

3o. Finally, the social and financial status or the LILic

personnel is rich sore compatible and consistent with the en-

vironient of the new building than is that of the LITTED family.

The above-cited revised vork scheaule was Initiated In July 1966 and

the actual covesent of the LItics into the new bace bein in late

Septeaber 1965.

1.

On 24 January 1956, the LICOCL run reported that LIPSTICK/LILlIC vae avallnhle,

LINCHPIN was Imodintely contacted with instrictiona to inventigate this

possibility.

Prelininary Invostigation through the janitor rovealed that there

was a front apartient available which was ideally suited for our purposes.

LINCHPIN contacted to orner who atated that the apartmont was not for rent sinco

his daughter was goin, to movo into it. The omer did offer LINCHPIN his

daughter's old apartmont which was in the back of the building.

LINCHPIN

contacted the daughter and found that hor agartment une not suited for our

and mentioned to her casually that should she not take the front

apartment, he would be interested. The told LINCHPIN that she didn't really

want it and would toll her father to rent it to LINCHPIN.

Subsoquently

LINCHPIN again contacted the oiner and was told that he cold have the front

apartment.

2.

LINCHPIN has executed the contract for one joar for LILYPIC at $u0,00 US per

nonth..

He plane to move from the present RA'PSE baso by 5 Yebruary 1956 and

place his furniture in storage for approsinataly one week.

The furniture wlll

be moved to the

storage warehouse by one moving company and taken out of the

storage vareliouse by another noving company. Although 1t is realised that thie

series of moves would not cover the trail of the furnituro to an experienced

Inventigator, 1t will prevent questlons by nei,hbors who seo the furniture boing

noved just one-tali block and also prevent cosients from the moving men them

selvos who would move the furniture thie one half block.

Since

the RAPPER base conalated of one bedroos and the LILYRIC base contains

three bedrooms, and is sonerally largor in all respects, it will be necessary to

purchase additional furniture to nake LINCHPI!"s occupancy normal in all

appearances. It is estinated that the requisite arount of furniture needed for

this purpose: will not acaregate in excess of $500 US.

Further,

since this

apartinent is rather large for ono single ran, LINCHPIN's brother le baing cleared,

and, after cloarance, will nove in the apartent with uNCirl! to sarvo a

relief operator and lend covor to the baso.

It to planned that Linic will bo kopt complotal courtronted from LIlaTio

and other LiP TICK operations. LIPTICY 30 will act as eul out betwen the

Station and Ll CHIPTi, and has boon inatructed that he la not to mention thia

duty to anyone. Since LiSTICK 20 does not know of the extstence of LIM:ED,

the tiric oporation le 0o plotely compartmented.

The LILYRIC base will be prinolpally used for photographie curvetllance of the

LI'CRICK target, workins alteinataly but without any patters, with the LiareD

base. This working schedule will be worked out by the Case Officer In advance

and Civen to both besos. Since eo plote co partentation la destrod, the flas

does the processing for LITTED. Later, the processing my be done by LiNCHPIN

In his ononical laboratory In order to take thie load ors the Statiou personnel.

Involved.

LINCIPIN has a faurly woll equippod chenical Inboratory that, with a

for nodifications, could be uned for the prucessing of the filma and printo.

At prosent WINCHPIN has a partner in this laboratory and it 1a planned that the

partner ulll bo clored.

Thia Statlun aincoroly feele that by the alterative use of this bage with LilaTED

that many öf the outward olgns of photographic surveillance (possibly only

apparent to the Case Officer knowing they iore there and locking for thom w1ll

be reduced, The acquisition of this base, in a senso, provides the best possible

sover for the LIMITTD baso by decroasing the use of that base.
