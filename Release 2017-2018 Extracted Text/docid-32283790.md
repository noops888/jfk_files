DAY again spoke of his travels to Mexico and Cuba,

boasting that he had been in Cuba during the United States Naval

blockade. He remarked of going to Cuba under an assumed name,

utilizing a false passport and simulated identification documents.

His purpose in going to Cuba was "to visit bars and secure a

female companion." He bragged of being able to obtain a false

passport and other simulated identification documents such as

birth and marriage certificates. He specifically asserted,

"Anyone can get false passports or documents within 40 miles

of Chicago for $125." He refused to supply the location of this

place or furnish

any other details.

DAY told of being in Mexico in November, 1963. He stated

that on November 22, 1963--the date of the assassination of

President JOHN F. KENNEDY- he was in Dallas, Texas, en route through

that city with three Mexicans he had picked

l. up in South Texas.

He became aware of the assassination while in Dallas, Texas. He

claimed he did not have any information concerning the assassination

OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD. However, reflecting on the assassination,

he recalled being in Juarez, Mexico, on

_or about November 7-8,

1963, and heard some Mexicans say that an American boy had been

attempting to go to Cuba and on two occasions had gone to the

Cuban Embassy in Mexico. He presumed this Ameriçan boy might

have been OSWALD.

DAY, in remarking of the assassination of President

KENNEDY; asserted, "Kennedy should have been shot even before he

was inaugurated." DAY commenced to vilify President KENNEDY for

his policies concerning Cuba, the institution of the Naval blockade

of Cuba, and for "his bayonet-point integration measures in the

than in the United States."
