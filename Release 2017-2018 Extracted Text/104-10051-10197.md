On 26 June Costille Invited Golub to have lunch with him at the Savoy

Restaurant in Helsinkl, as it was Costille"s turn to pay the blll..

Golub®s

first remarks concerned the anount of work he had to do in the Consulate,

as ho was alone there now since Mikhael LYUBIMOV#t had deranted.

stated that lyubinov had now obteined the diplomatic title of Third

tary and was currently in Moseow for some training prior to a POS

assignment

somewhere besides Helsinki, probably either london or stookholm.

stated that he missed lyubimor tremendoualy both office wise and personally.

He was very fond of Lyubinov and often remarked what an intelligent young

men he was.

20. The coxversation then turned to Costille's recent vacation in lapland.

Golub again told Costille that he was not going to be able to take a

vacation this jear as the new imbassador wanted him to remain In Helsinki.

Golub then stated to Costille, "I have heard that you speak fluent Russian."

Costille stated that that was very complimentary but that he spoke about

as good Russian as Golub spoke English.

Costille told him that he had

studied Russian at the University of California and on his own but that

about all he could do now was understand and read some and that what 11ttle

spenicing ability he had was practically gone.

Golub commented It was

good that Costille know some Russian and said that more Americans should

study it. Golub then asked way Costille was not trying to improve his

Russian.

Costille answered that he was trying to learn to speak Finish

and that it was too much of a chore to study two languages at the same time.

Golub said that what Costille neejod was more practice In Russian and pro-

ceeded, to speak in Russian.

considerably and he was able to easily convince Golub that his Russian was

far from fluent. As was mentioned in previous dispatches, Costille had

never attempted to conceal from Golub the fact that he knew Russian.

Lasue just never came up.

Since Golub is fluent in Finniah, the common

language automatically became Finnish.

Il we had realized this Golub

contact was going to be so frequent, we would have made it a point at the

first to be the one to tell Golub that Costille knows some Russian.

might have made Golub & little suspicious.

At the last meeting Costille

had mentioned to Golub that he had been studying Russian some.

did not respond, so evidently he either did not hear or understand Costille.

Golub asked Costille what other languages he had studied. Costille toid

him he had studied Spanish in high sohool. Colub said that this was an

casy language and not studied too much in the Soviet Union. After making

this remark, he quiokly corrected himself and stated that a large percentage

of the world spoke Spanish and that it was becoming & much more popular

language in the Soviet Union.

Costille mentioned that Russian had become

a very popular language in the States and that within the last two years

his high school In California, which was quite small, even was offering the

Russian language. This seemed to impress Golub.

While speaking Russian to Costille, Golub began using the familiar form of

the language rather than the polite form which the two had always used. Ha

looked at Costille and asked if it would be alright to use first names.

when Costille agreed, he reached across the table and shook Costille's

hand.

le then told Costille that thare was a new Cultural Officer in th

Soviet Embassy by the name of Tenul ZIGALit who wanted to meet some youn

Nestern Embassy offloers, especially Americans. Colub statnd that he had

given him Costille's name and that Costille would be receiving a written

The above portions of this dispatch were written on 1 July.

It is now 7 Julys

and the reception mentioned in para four above never came off. When first

Inviting Costille to this reception, Golub made it quite certain that Costille

was free for the lth and made him promise to come.

On Thursday, 2 July,

Golub called Costille again to make sure he had not forgotten the date.

Costille told him that as jet he had not received the official invitation

from Zegal. Golub stated that he would receive it shortly.

By Monday, the

day of the reception, still no invitation had been received. At 1600 Costille

decided to phone Golub to find out what had happened.

Golub Informed him

then that the roception had been postponed until the soviet Ambassador, who

is presently touring Finland, returned to Helsinki. Golub apologized for

not telling Costille earlier and invited Costille for lunch the next days

9.

Lunch with Golub has just been completed. He was more Jovial than we have

over seen him.

He admitted that he had been up all evening drinking with a

good friend and hadn"t fully sobered up yet. His first move at lunch was

to order vodka and beer.

He again apologized for the nix-up on the reception

Invitations but said that his Ambassador didn't arrive back in Helsinki in

time. Ho promised to send Costille an invitation as soon as the date had

been confirmed.

The lunch was spent mostly in polite, friendly conversation.

Golub remarked that now Moscow had given him the authority to give Americans

visas without prior approval from Moseow. He stated that this would make

his job mch easter, and as long as he was convinced the American was "al)

right he could give him his visa In a matter of minutos..

When Costille

mentioned that he had a personal friend coming to Helsinki for a visit in

. October, Golub stated that Costille should insist she see Leningrad and that

if Costille would bring her to the Soviet Embassy, he would give her a visa

at once.

Golub then asked Costillo to explain the "James Dean" problem and the negro

problem In America to him. Golub stated that he personally did not like

negroes and admitted that the Soviet Union also had a juvenile delinguency

problem ("stilyagi"). Golub mentioned that Khrushchev was coming to Finland

soon which always meant a lot of work for the Embassy. He then proceeded

to talk about what a great, intelligent, but practical man Khrushchev was.

Golub also made some derogatory remarks about his wife, and how glad he was

*that she had gone to Moscow.

Returning from lunch, Golub insisted that

Costillo stop by his apartment to hear some of his Russian records and have

a glass of cognac. As they walked through the door, Golub, at the top of

his voice, In Russian yelled, "Is there any one home?

It is so nice not to

have anyone answer." Golub is extremely proud of his record collection

which is small but includes some Challapin, Ichaikovsky and Prokoviet records.
