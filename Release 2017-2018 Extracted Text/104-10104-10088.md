MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Orlando Avla y Bosch

Jaf the WH Haitt Desk called en

25 May 1967 and slated that they had been advised by an asset

In New York that Rene Joares Luor had bee arrested by ta

FBI in New York City on that date. A bunch warrant fer the

arrest d Loan had been laned by the Diatriet Court for the

Southern Dietrict of Florida alnco he falled to appear for le

arralgnment in March 196%. He was Indieted along with

Rolando Masterrer for plotting an Involon of Haiti. Mr.

maid that they had no operational interest in Leon, but thelr sources

had indicated Leon might be, conaldered a political asset in the post

Duvallier ers la Halt. Mr.

Jamlised my opinion as to

whether or not this possible lumm use of Leca might have an

ellect on the, charges being dropped agalnet him. I told

that it seemed highly umlikely that the Judge or

the United Statea Attorney would consider dropping the charges

since boon had filled to appear before the court when no ordered.

?. I called Mr. Morris, Internal Security Divolon,

Departnent of Justice, the attorney handling both the Masferrer

and Bosch prosscutions, and told him that Leen had been arrested.

It was in s previous conversation with Mr. Morris that he told

me that the United States Attorney expected to obtnin the Indietment

aginat Bouch on 31 May 1967. Mr. Morris said that both the

United States Attorney and the Department of Justles were

considoring postponing the date of bringing the indietent agalant

Bosch because of the problems which had developed in Mini after

& Cuban refugee named Rivere had been arrested. The information

avnilable indleates that Orlando Bosch has been the leader of the

proteat demonotrations against Rivero's arrest. It would sherafore

seem prudent to delay the indictment rather than precipitate

greater demonstrations ln the Cuban community of Miant.
