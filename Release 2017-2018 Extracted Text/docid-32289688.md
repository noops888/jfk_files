CONTEMPT OF COURT

ReBuairtel, 4/18/67.

It is the considered opinion at the Los Angeles

Division that dissemination of information to the Department

concerning AUSA STEPHEN D. MILLER

as set out in Los Angeles

airtel to the Bureau, 4/14/67, could definitely compromise

LA 4476-C-TE.

this source is now extremely close to

LCN BOSs FRANK DESIMONE, it is not believed worth the risk

involved.

AUSA MILLER has openly announced his resignation

effective May 1, 1967.

Los Angeles will follow his activities in regard

to VICTORIA LOCKWOOD, through LA 4476-C-TE, and will keep

Bureau advised of pertinent developments.
