Details:

Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered to be assassination

records must be made available to the National Archives and

Records Administration (NARA) in their original form.

The

JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain information,

but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be maintained

until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in full.

Therefore, the serial will not be returned to Philadelphia.

Since the original will be sent to the NARA, copies of

the serials should be made for record purposes prior to shipment

to FBIHQ:

The serials should be received at FBIHQ no later than

c.0.B. 9/21/98.

Please ship the following serial to FBIHQ, JFK Task

Force, Attention Catherine L. Lamey, Room 11144.

PH file no. 92-1027, airtel dated 5/24/63 and

surveillance log (undated, although according to the airtel the

report was made 5/20/63).

New York's copy of the airtel and the

first two pages of the surveillance log are attached for

identification purposes. Philadelphia should provide all original

pages of the surveillance log.
