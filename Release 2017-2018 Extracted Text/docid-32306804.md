as regularly as usual.

meeting of the

DL. 92-36

On September 27, 1968, DL T-l advised that while it

mightappear that JOSEPH CIVELLO

has no connection with the

Airway Liquor Store on West Mockingbird Lane, near Love

Field, she was present when CHARLES CIVELLO,.

brother of

JOSEPH, called the owner of the real estate where the store is

now located, in 1959, to arrange for the lease of the

property. The source related that at that time JOSEPH

CIVELLO was present with CHARLES CIVELLO and JOSEPH CIVELLO

was the one who gave CHARLES CIVELLO instructions on what

to say when he talked to the owner about the lease.

The

source advised that after CHARLES CIVELLO talked to the

owner on the telephone, CHARLES and JOSEPH CIVELLO left

reportedly for downtown Dallas to the Republic National

Bank to obtain the necessary money required by the lease.

The files of the Dallas Office show that on

November 18, 1959, Detective H. M. HART, Intelligence

advised that CHARLIS

brother-in-law, have

applied for a

Airway Liquor Store, 3122 West Mockingbird Lane.

The files further show that on September 24, 1959,

DL T-2, advised SA ROBERT P. GEMBERLING that JOSEPH CIVELLO,

either directly or through his brother, CHARLES EDWARD

CIVELLO, had leased a piece of property on Mockingbird

Lane, Dallas, Texas, near Love Field Airport, on which he plans

to construct

a liquor store.

Source stated he believed an

individual by the name of MUSSO would also be connected

in this enterprise.

Further that the property leased to

CIVELLO was done through the owner of the property, CARL

C. WEICHSEL, President, Great National Life Insurance

Company, Dallas, Texas.

The files of the Dallas Office further showthat

on May 15, 1961, ED BUTLER, Operator of the Humble Service

station,

located at the corner of Cedar Springs and

Mockingbird Lane, located close to the Airway Liquors,

furnished the following information to SA ROBERT M.

BARRETT.

BUTLER advised that CHARLES CIVELLO and ROSS MUSSO

had been very steady customers up until May 1, 1961.

JOE CIVELLO would occasionally come by for gas but

nothing else.

They charged all their purchases on a

personal charge account under the name "Airway Liquor

Store" and the bills were paid by check drawn on an

account at the Exchange National Bank.

BUTLER stated

however, that since May 1, 1961, none of the above had

been in

for any business.
