On December 14, 1962, NY I-I advised that a

meeting of the Executive Committee of the New York Chapter

of the FPCC was held on December 7, 1962, at the office

of the FPCC in New York City. NY

T-l advised that the

purpose of the meeting was to set up a program for the

membership meeting on December 11, 1962. NY I-I advised

that after the program was set up, LEE requested that the

Executive Committee include in the program a request for

the membership to buy tickets to a banquet and dance to

be held aù the Casa Cuba Club on December 15, 1962. LEE V

stated that the banquet and dance 1s being held to raise

funds for the defense of three Cubans who have been arrested

for sabotage.

IFE stated that the request should be toned

down so that

it would not seem that the FPCC was undertaking

the defense of the three Cubans.

Lee said that the attorney

for the Cubans had asked him not to get too involved in

the defense as it would not help his case by having the

FPCC involved.

On December 18, 1962, NY I-4 advised that a

meeting of the Executive Committee of the New York Chapter

of the FPCC was held on December 17, 1902, at the office

members were present. NY I-4 advised that those present

agreed to hold a forum at Adelphi Hall, New York City,

on the first and third Mondays of each month and MILES

BIDWELL was assigned the task of contacting several individuals

to be used as speakers at the forums.(o

On December 18, 1962, NY I-2 advised that a

meeting of the Executive Committee of the New York Chapter

of the FPCC was held on December 17, 1962, at the office

of the FPCC in New York City. NY I-2 advised that at the

meeting a discussion was held concerning a series of forums

to be held by the New York Chapter and it was mentioned

that the chapter should obtain a group of forceful speakers

as some of the speakers that have appeared at fummun

in the past have been very disappointing?
