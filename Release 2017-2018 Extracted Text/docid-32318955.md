ASSASSINATION MATERIALS DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1992

@ ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F.&KENNEDY

UTTED STATES (U.S.) SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 282 (S. J. RES. 282)

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES JOINT RESOLUTION 454(H.J. RES. 454)

BUDED: /20/92

Re Dallas airtel to Director dated 6/2/92.

The Dallas request to microfilm its John F. Kennedy

(JFK) Assassination files has been carefully reviewed by the

Information Management Division (IMD) and the Criminal

Investigative Division and it has been determined that FBIHQ is

unable to support the Dallas request for funds.

Accordingly,

Dallas should forward its original files to FBIHQ.

Since Dallas will be relinguishing its only copy of the

assassination files, IMD will provide timely response (including

facsimile transmissions) to any Dallas request for a file review

or for specific documents in connection with any ongoing

investigative activities.

Time is of the essence since the JFK task force is

utilizing 30 summer employees to prepare the inventory of our

files.

FBIHQ therefore needs to inventory and process the

original Dallas files identified in Dallas teletype dated

1/28/92.

In addition to that material, files 134-307, 134-308,

and 105-1435 concerning Marina Oswald,

and the 3 x 5

and 5 x 8

Special Indices also need to be sent to FBIHQ.
