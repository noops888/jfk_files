(Crockard) Kuhn. This was a Commnist Party Meeting.

The persons who were in attendance who were recognized

U.S.W.A. C.I.0.

A.E.t.

4 • Arnold Johnson: A former state chairman of the

something Constructive. This Gill recently, a few years

or less ago Made a trip to the Soviet Union

ete on the

Youth Conference Know as the 'World Youth Conference.'

He wind probably emerge from the New York thing as a

full time organiser in some special field such as youth.

At the start of the Meeting Genne brought out

her brief case full of clippings (Newspaper) ete

she

also had a lot of penciled notes which she was

undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing

and to give others hell for not co operating with her.

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around

the late Pres. Kennedy.

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a

Comnist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

agalnst the C. party of America but by the time the

reactionaries were getting started it was announced

that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the

extrene

right had been active.

This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

c. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the working class but the work of the extreme

right or almost

a fascist act.

This seemed to sober

the masses that it was the same caliber of people who

had insulted Stevenson only weeks before in Dallas,

Texas.

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this

Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he

told them he gets lots of letters of enquiry about the

C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds

of others and even sent him Iiterature If he requested

it.

They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with a

want him:

statement but he

stated to them he would have to dig the

letter out and be sure before he Made any statement.

Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when he got back to

New York to look in the files it he had a letter from d

Wn Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also an

Immate of Cambridge Asylum for a period of time, Gorby

asked Johnson to compare the letter of Pokey's with

Oswald's to see if they didn't have a lot in Common.

Palmer stated that he thought

the statement by the

Methodist Minister Covered the situation very good

when me stated that the fact that the Murder of B1l1

Moore, M Edgar Evers and others in the south going

by without punishment had set the stage for the

Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone readily

agreed.

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marist

Could do such a thing. There is not Much doubt that

since the soviet union had expelled him by not

giving him a Citizenship in the Soviet Union because

they thought him to be an Agent of Fascism. Genne

Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her

story told about the N.A.A.C.P. and CORE.

she finally got her Chance

to unload.

She stated that about the time of the Civil Rights

March on Washington a

few days before she had been

working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the

Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted

to talk about her.

She gave him answers on the

phone and finally hung up on him.

fron the time

this phone conversation was completed she had been

quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a Communist

party Member, which brought about her expolsion from

the N.A.A.C.P., but since has been restored to

Membership.

Then lately a Man (Negro) by name of Johnson

head of the local Core group was indicted for robbing a

bus

driver in Steubenville,

Ohio.

Gemne had got in

touch with R. Gorby as she

thought: Johnson was being

framed.

Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting

that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed.

The best thing to de stated Gorby was to give him

help but do not put core and the

NAACP out on a limb

by doing it..
