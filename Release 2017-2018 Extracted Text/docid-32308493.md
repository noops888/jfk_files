The files of the Miami Office contain the follow-

ing information concerning GERALD PATRICK SENNING, which

information has been furnished byxMi 639-S.*C)(U)

U.S.A

In April, 1961, GEORGE/RANNER, [Former Army

Major, established an anti-CASTRO. organization known

as the Anti-Communist Legionnaires. This organization

consisted of about twenty American adventurers and

soldiers of fortune.

In May, 1961, HEMMING took over the organization

and established a military training camp in the Florida

Everglades, about 40 miles west of Miami.

He recruited

about 17 Americans from Houston, Denver and Chicago, with

reckless promises of high pay and adventure.

In June, 1961, HEMMING held a parachute demon-

stration at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and received con-

siderable press publicity.

As a result a large number

of adventurers came to Miami to join him and his group,

many of these persons were later arrested for vagrancy,

bad checks, breakinghand entering, and thefts. Most of

them have since left Man 112

On December 4, 1963, HEMMING and twelve of his men

were arrested by United States Customs, for attempting to

illegally export arms, and going on a military expedition.

Later the U.So District Court Judge, Miami, Florida,

dismissed the case because the U.Ss, Department of

Justice failed to go ahead with the prosecution.

In February, 1963, HEMMING collaborated with

Miami Attorney CHARLES ASHMANN, and furnished false in-

formation to the press and the

British government con-

cerning the capture of eight Cubans on February 20, 1963

by the Cuban government.

HEMMING, a 6'6", 26 year old adventurer and

mercenary, is frequently seen wearing a U.S. Marine Corps

Combat suit in downtown Miami; frequently wears a Van

Dyke type of goatee, and is called one of the 'Three

Musketeers" by the press, because of his handsome appear

ance, and his flair for wearing an Australian type bush

hat.

HEMMING is not cooperative with the United

States government, is a self-styled expert on Latin

affairs, U.S. policy, federal law and guerrilla war-

fare. HEMMING interprets the failure of the United

States government to prosecute him for his violations of

federal law as meaning U.S. government approval of his

activity.

AMM 639-stadvised that LORENZO MALL is loosely

associated with HEMMING, has been in Miami for about

three months, is disagreeable, not liked, has bad

personality and is of low moral standards. HALL speaks

some Spanish, is unemployed and from his demeanor and
