of HELEN WEYGANDT CARTER (known close friend of MEADOWS) that she

was presently living in Apartment 208, 1836 Stevens Forest Drive.

She had given the school a telephone number of WH 6-4458, but

this was later determined to be

a nonexistent number.

On 9/7/62, the manager of the apartment house advised

that a Mr. and Mrs.

JOHN L. CARTER resided in the apartment, that

the rent was paid every month in cash by Mr. CARTER.

The manager

furnished a description of Mr. CARTER which matched that of BILLY

RAY GRIMES. She also identified a photograph of MEADOWS as a

person she

has seen at the apartment house.

The manager has

stated she would furnish any information she could develop con-

cerning MEADOWS, GRIMES and HELEN CARTER, especially telephone

umbers and license numbers observed at the apartment house

told her that one of their

neighbors was telling the FBI about

visitors they were having. FUQUA had told his wife that he had

learned this from a Dallas police officer who had told a friend

of FUQUA's that undoubtedly the FBI had somebody in the neighbor-

hood watching their residence.

Mrs. C

FUQUA advised he had heard that JOHN ELI STONE

(D1 162-37) got his line for athletic events from an unknown

source in Shreveport, Louisiana,

and also that he would lay off

bets with a contact in Las Vegas.

FUQUA had no other details

concerning this, but did state that practically all bets placed

in Dallas with bookies filter back to STONE by layoff.

FUQUA advised that Dallas bookmakers CHARLES CLARENCE

HILL (DL 162-New) and NORVILLE YOUNG STANFIELD (DL 162-186) are

on a par in size of operation with SHERMAN FRANKLIN LITTLE and

AL MEADOWS.

He stated these two operate closely together with

HIlL, operating out of a drugstore at 2700 Ross Avenue, and that

STANFIELD has a place in Dallas, whereabouts unknown to FUQUA.

for large amounts where there was a risk of losing heavily,

but would lay off such bets with JOHN ELI STONE.

PCI advised that a Jackson, Mississippi, gambler,

T. J. TILLMAN (DL 162-1), was in Dallas attempting to set up

either a contact for accepting lay-off bets for connections in

Las Vegas or to operate as a bookmaker financed by an unknown

Las Vegas group.

PCI stated TILLMAN formerly worked for this

same unknown group in Las Vegas and would attempt to obtain

further details which, if obtained, will predicate the initiation

of a new investigation by Dallas.

EDWARD BARNES (DL 166-66) had been in Dallas for about ten days

in close contact with Dallas hoodlum RUSSELL DOUGLAS MATTHEWS

(DL 92-213). PCI stated BARNES was attempting to evade service

of a subpoena by a local Oklahoma City Grand Jury which was

presently in session. FUQUA stated that BARNES and MATTHEWS
