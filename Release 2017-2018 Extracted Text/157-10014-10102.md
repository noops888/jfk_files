MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: John Rosselli

1. In early April Mr. William Harvey asked me to arrange

a contact with Subject. The meeting in New York City was arranged

for 9 April.

I explained to Mr. Harvey that the undersigned would

take no part in future operations proposed for Subject.

2. In the interim I have kept Mr. Harvey fully informed

reference to my briefing of The Attorney General on the former

project and cautioned him that I felt that any future projects of

this nature should have the tacit approval of the Director of Central

Intelligence.

3 On this date Mr. Harvey called me and indicated that

he was dropping any plans for the use of Subject for the future.

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Fritz:

In response to your telephone call of 27 June 1975,

I offer you the following based on my memory of certain

events and the atmosphere of the times:

(Please note

that my records on this era are not all that precise.

My memory is vivid and may be biased. However, as a

close observer, here is what I recall, for what it is

worth.)

You should be aware that this Agency felt itself

to be under very strong pressure in the early 1960s to

bring about change in the Cuban regime.

This pressure

was strongest after the Bay of Pigs incident in April

1961 and although it dissipated somewhat after the Cuban

Missile Crisis in October 1962, it has never really

completely disappeared. In any event, when Mr. Robert F.

Kennedy accepted

the proposals by General Lansdale which

led to the formation of the MONGOOSE Project, it was

clear to the DCI, Mr. John A. McCone, that the major tasks

in. this broad covert

action program would fall on CIA.

McCone in turn made it clear to Agency officials that

this task was very much a direct charge on the Agency.

It should also be noted that from the beginning, there

was little hope that the program as conceived would

actually achieve its purpose which was to bring about

the removal of the Castro government and to replace it

with one whose interests would be more compatible with

American interests and the interests of other governments

in the Western Hemisphere.

William K. Harvey, who was placed in charge of the

Agency's Cuban Task Force, has, as you know, a very

special type of personality. Both his manner and his

method, in my opinion, tend to be thorough, comprehensive,

and time-consuming.

Because of the nature

of his assign-

ment and because of his personality traits, his personal

relations, particularly with General Lansdale and with

the Attorney General, were never very pleasant to begin

with, and tended to deteriorate steadily.

A climax of sorts occurred at a meeting of the

Special Group Augmented during which the Chairman asked

a specific question, noting that he had ten minutes in

which to hear the reply and wanted a crisp answer within

that period.

Mr.

Harvey was not forthcoming, and the

Chairman left the meeting after ten minutes expressing

strong dissatisfaction with things in general and Harvey

in particular.

After this meeting it was clear to McCone that

Harvey had broken his lance and would have to be replaced.

In due course, he was replaced.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, when it was

virtually impossible to get access to top officials in the

government and get their guidance on day-to-day affairs;

Harvey, who did indeed try to get such guidance, on his

own concluded that United States policy was headed toward

a full-scale invasion of Cuba.

He ordered a number of

agent teams to be dispatched to the island for intelligence

collection and to be in place as assets to support a con-

ventional military operation.

General Lansdale claimed

this was done without his knowledge and authorization and

there was a confrontation in McCone's office. McCone

concluded that unless these teams were being

sent to

satisfy specific requirements by the Secretary of State

and the Secretary of Defense that they should be recalled.

Since there was no such requirement, they were recalled.

In a separate meeting, McCone reassured Lansdale that

he was in fact Chief of Operations.

As a result of this,

Harvey earned another black mark as not being fully under

control.

I trust the foregoing will be of some value to you.

Sincerely,

Wast
