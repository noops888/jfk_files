was overthrown, Castro made Ray his Minister of

Publie Works.

Ray did a very creditable job "re-

building" Cuba and acquired a substantial popular

following.

As Minister of Public Works, he showed a

great understanding of the needa of the people of Cuba

and a real concern for their velfare.

Although liberal and pro-revolutionary, Ray resented

the Coumunist doniration of the Castro regine and in

November 1959 he was replaced by a Communist. He

lived for several months under surveillarce that

amounted to house arrest and was unable to acquire

another post.

However, he remained in Cuba and

organized the MRP as an anti-Castro movement. Me

escaped to the US in October 1960. Hls lesdership,

ability, and integrity are unmistakable.

SUBJECT

:Donn MtV ON, luthor or 21GA liticle, and

Juan ERUIAGA, Subject of Article.

1. Donn Hale MUNSON, born 1005, reiident of Los

Angeles, approached LICONET/1 in 1964 claiming he

represented a large group.of Cuban exiles in the Los

Angeles area. MUNSON asked LICCRT/1 about the location

of training camps, etc. LICONET/1 reported the discussion

to Station Mexico City and was instructed to avoid MUNSON.

Donn Hale MUNSON is probably identical with the Donn MUNSON

who authored the saga article. There are no additional

identifiable traces on MUNSON.

2. There are nunerous traces on Juan ERQUINGA sircorbe,

the orner of che weapons plant named in the iasa article.

The r3l also reported ERCIAGA was involved in the sale of

arme to Cuban revolutionaries in 1055. 4lthouch RI was un

able to locate the roport, it was classified co Manolo lY's

201 file. This nould tend

to support the .02a clain that

any weapons suoplied bu ERCUlAGA's firn went to the JUlE

crowd, not to any Agency supported group.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meetings with Manolo Ray, San Juan, Puerto Rico

and 15 October 1966

MIG-21--Defecting Pllot--ot al.

In lengthy discussions on this point it developed

hat Ray has been unable to obtain nny more pertinent infor

nation sinco he first called the matter to AMBADGER's

attention almost two months ago.

Tho basis of the "Mig

Plot" la a tip ho roceived from an inside contact which was

brought to him

by someone exiting Cuba.

Ray considers the

inside contact rellable but prefers not to identify him.

Ray has not been able to determine it the inside contact

or can arrango contact,

Mig Pilot who reportedly

is fed up with the situation In

Cuba and plans to defect with his airplane whenever he has

The "tip" Ray received was to this effect

1.C., that there is a Mig Pllot who is disenchanted and

plans to defect with his plane. One point Ray was spocific

on was that the plane was described as "one of the smaller

Migs" and according to Ray it 1s not a 11g-21.

20 .

After Ray's original contacts with AMBADGER on this

subject (wherein the plane was apparently erroneously

identified as a MIG-21) Ray claims ho sent a message to the

inside contact requesting the complete detatls-we had asked

for.

He has received no reply.

In response to my request

at

the mooting on 13 October

1966 he told me at our subsequent

meeting on

15 October that he attempted to reach his inside

contact by phone but was unsuccessful.

He was urged to

continue until he reached the

party and to obtain as much

detail on this

matter as possible so we could hopefally

clarify the situation.

He assurred me he would follow through

on this and report to AMBADGER.

(It seemed pretty obvious to

me after two discussions with Ray on this subject that he has

no direct means of reaching the original reporting source on

the "Mig

plot"

and consequently may never be able to verify

the original

"tip" and obtain further details.

In any cour loutlaned für him in general the

U.S. Government interest in obtaining a modern version of

the MIG-21 and the financial and other rewards available

to a pilot who would bring one out.

I emphasized that any

activity along this line would have to be strictly Ray's

and the JURE's operation and done through his contacts

sources reiterating agnin that therefore it was essential

that he confire the plane,

modol, pilot, ete. reported to

him to determine if the operation was feasible.

1.

We spent sonetime discussing his "image" both

• inside Cuba and with the exiles.

He agreed that at the

present time it could hardly be lower and something rather

dramatic was needed to improve it.

We both agreed that 11

he could pull off a successful operation to defect a MIG-21

pilot with his plane it would do much to restore his and

the JURE's name and prestige.

NEVORANDU FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

Personal Situation:

in san Juan his he shines ing ad Pla dung sece

a personal friend and JURE colleague who is in the

publicity business.

RAY said he Just signed a

contract for the planning of a commercial develop

ment site in San Juan,

from which he will realize

several thousand dollars profit.

His principal

(and pet) project is the promotion and attempt to

raise through private funds the financing of a

plant to mass produce low-cost prefabricated housing

designed by him. He claims with an investment of

$200,000 he can

sell

mass produce prefabricated homes to

for $3,000 which would be ideal for Puerto

Rico's needs.

Recent Trip to Santo Domingo:

RAY said his recent trip to Santo Domingo

was strictly for business purposes.

He hopes to

start a

small project in Santo Domingo to produce

prefabricated housing.

The small project he has

in mind can get underway with an expenditure of

$80,000, which he feels confident can be raised

in Santo Domingo.

He said he naturally talked with

some people in the government about Cuba and the

JURe, but that the government must become stronger

and more confident before there would be any possi

bility of obtaining their assistance-or blessing-

in conducting any activities against Cuba.

Internal Contacts.

d.

One gets the impression that RAY lives

somewhat removed from the actual realitiesd the

•Cuban

internal situation.

He has & tendency to

compare

the

internal situation today with that

which existed in Batista's time when he (RAY) was

one of the leaders of the 26th of July underground

resistance

movement in Habana. RAY maintains

direct personal contact with many new arrivals

seeking asylum both in Puerto Rico and the U.S.

and also undoubtedly receives a certain amount of

general information and gossip from other JURE

contacts and supporters.

He claims to have many

friends and former associates illside, which is

probably true, but does not have any regular or

secure means to communicate with them.

It appears

obvious that these friends and contacts are not

working together, if at. all, and that he has no

cohesive resistance group or force as such inside.

I questioned him about several personalities

such as Carlos Franqui, Pedro Miret, Emilio Aragones,

and others.

He had no specific information

at all

on their activities in recent months but said he

"could get

In summary on this

point, it would appear that RAY and the JURE main-

tain

no regular contact with any internal "supporters":

that he undoubtedly still has many former friends

and supporters inside but just what they would do-

or how

far they would go--to support him is a moot

question.

JURE Propaganda Activities.

The JURE, Manolo RAY, Emilio Guede, and

others, have a half-hour weekly program which is

carried on 4 different Puerto Rican radio stations

between 6:30=7:30 PM each Sunday.

which is taped in advance,

features commentaries on

news and events in Cuba,

interviews with recently

arrived refugees, and other items of current interest.

The program is composed without cost

and all radio time on the 4 stations is donated free

of charge.

Future Plans.

RAY 18 a man who is

relaxed,

is now engaged

in making a

legitimate Ilvelthood for hanself, his

wife and three childron but still seriously dedi

cated and motivated towards secking the overthrow

of the Castro government.

He has a realistic outlook

to a considerable degree, although as mentioned in

paragraph d., above, his viewpoints on the reality

of the internal situation in present day Cuba aro

somewhat naive. As an experienced resistance organizer

and fighter in the 26th of July novement against

Batista, he knows the value of propaganda in preparing

the veneral populace for resistance.

He also knows

that propaganda is uscless and counterproductive

without follow-up positive results.

He speaks of

continuing his local radio broadcasts (which he

readily admits are useful only to maintain some

spirit amongst the oxiles for possible future use),

and

at some later dato--he has no timetable--hopes

to obtain facilities in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, or

some other site where he can bean broadcasts into Cuba.

His intention

being to follow-up the broadcasts with

action.

He speaks again of clandestine entry into

Cuba himself to

people

contact sources within, prove to

that there is a resistance movement, and te

form a nucleus for later action.

He openly admits

the blunder of his last "publicized" return

if it is done again it must be completely clandestine

and unannounced.

He seems to have no fear of returning

and claims he still has plenty of frierds who would

hide and help him.

He made an off-hand reference to

the Agency

furnishing him assistance to enter clan-

destinely at some future date.

He was told that his

sources

in Miami

surely knew of soveral"faily run"

operations which

successfully to Cuba

if and when he was ready to return.

Financial Situation.

•RAY made no request for financial assistance

and from all indications is doing fairly well in his

local business.

RAY plans to travel to the U.S. inerly November for

about two weeks and said he would visit JURE representatives

in several large cities, including D.C. He will be in touch

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY / FiLe

1. During a brief IDY stopover al Headquarters on 23 August 1966.

QUSPORT -1 said he had talked with Manolo RAY in San Juan, Puerto Rico

on 22 August.

According to QUSPORT-I, RAY had no additional pertinent

formation concerning his alleged inside contacts or his recent meetin

ith Garria Bango in Madrid, Spain. ' RAY continues to insist that he hi

nside support in Cuba and contacts who are anti-regime and prepare

o assist him when needed. He did not reveal to QUSPORT-l, however

who the people were of where they are located.

2. RAY told QUSPORT-I that he wanted very much to see the writer

concerning a delicate operational matter. When pressed by QUSPORT -1

RAY said he had access to a MIG pilot in Cuba who was ready and anxious

to leave Cuba and was willing to fly out a MIG aircraft. RAY did not

mention the name or location of the pilot or the model MIG aircraft he was

Neither did he discuss his ways and means of communication with

the pilot and how he had determined the pilot's intentions to defect with

his airplane.

RAY told QUSPORT he wanted to discuss the matter with the

He admitted that a MIG aircraft might not now have as much value

to the U.S. because of the recent access to a MIC-21 in Isreal but that it

would have tremendous propaganda value if a Cuban pilot defected and

brought out a MIC. He said he particularly wanted to discuss the matter

with the writer because if the operation were successful he did not want

and the MRR or any other exile group taking credit. He

wanied to make sure that he and his group received all the propaganda

advantage which he would in turn expluit internally as further evidence to

his supporters inside that the JURE was active on the island. RAY in the

latter part o the conversation on this subject when he learned QUSPORT -I

was coming to Washington the following day, asked him to check with the

writer to determine if it was OK for him (RAY) to discuss this subject with

AMBADGER. (AMBADGER is the man who was recently introduced to RAY

In San Juan by Harry Mahoney as the man who would insure that any

information RAY wanted passed to the Agency would reach them. ) QUSPORT

told RAY that if he did not receive a phone call from him before the evening

of 20 August he should give AMBADGER all the details.

him to grass all the details lo AMBADGER even though according lo

QUSPORT-l's arrangement this was aut necessary.

OUSPORT-I was

unable, however, lo reach RAt by phone during the afternoon of

nO August.

About 8 p.m. on 20 lugust I received a collect phone call

from AMBADGER from San Juan.

AMBADGER was very excited and

said he had to see me right away. liter he settled down a bit he told

me he had just left RAY and his tro local lieutenants Emilio GUEDE

and Arturo VILLAR (the so-called triumvirate of the JURE). He said

RAY had contacted him and the four of them discussed the possibility

of defecting a Cuban MIG pilot and having him bring out his plane. In

essence and from what I could discuss over the phone the details were

substantially the same as those given to me by QUSPORT -I earlier in

the day. AMBADGER said he needed my guidance right away and

further urged me to come to San Juan to discuss the matter with RAY

who was pressing AMBADGER to see me.

He said he had agreed to see

RAY latter that night, I told AMBADGER I could not make the trip in

the next few days and that further there were a few basic facts I needed

to convince me that RAY really had the potential to pull off the operation.

I told AMBADGER to see RAY later that evening and to try and determine

the following:

a. Name of the MIG pilot.

b. Military field where he is stationed.

c. Type MIG he flys.

do RAY's commo it any with the pilot.

e. Estimated timing for the defection, i. e.. has the pilot

indicated he was ready to defect and awaiting instructions,

I asked AMBADGER to phone me if he could develop any further

information. AMBADGER phoned Mr. Mahoney on the afternoon of

24 August to report he had attempted to obtain further details from RAY

following his conversations with the writer but that RAY had replied he

did not know the name of the pilot or other details of the operation. (See

Mr. Mahoney's meino attached)

obvious questions concerning his Madrid/Cuban internal contacts and

the MIG pilot.

JIENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meeting with ANBANG-1, 28 April 1966

Andrews as 38 April 1966 the undersigned, usins the name

contacted ANBANG-1

the Hotel Sheraton in San Juan,

Puerto Rico. The following

points were discussed,

in addition to matters pertaining to

& projected

meeting of Cuban exiles, covered in a separate

AMBANG seemed much less aggressive than

when I used to talk to him a year and a half ago.

He seemed dispirited about the exiles and their

chances of ever doing anything to settle affairs

in Cuba.

The exiles do not seem to have any plans

for doing much of anything.

AMBANG-1 agreed that

the overthrow of Castro will probably come from the

inside, and that the exiles will have little

influence on the move that accomplishes it.

feels this is not all to the bad since, as le says,

there are a number of good men in Cuba in Important

posts who have

gotten sucked bit by bit into support

of communism but

are really not connunists.

him I believed the US would probably be willing to

such persons if they achieved the overthrow

of the regime and that the US would probably oppose

a wave of vengeance against "decent revolutionaries".

I told him this because I thought there was some

chance he might spread it about and the word might

"decent revolutionaries" in CubA,

In general, AHBANG-1 had less information

He told me that

SiONaI

Cuba about 25 April, that Arcos was as of that

date still

in prison but the charges against him

were thin and it was hoged he would be out in a

few days.

This means there was at least one

more telephone call than we knew of previously,

and this has probably served to increase the

pressure on Arcos).

I asked ANBANG-1 if his

contact with Arcos

in late 196% might not

been responsible for the arrest.

have

AMBANG-1 said

he did not think so.

We talked some about the

symbolic value of the Arcos family and I expressed

a strong interest in Arcos's selfare and in getting

the latest news about him.

I did this on the

chance that AMRANG-1 might assume Arcos had been

cur agent and we were concerned about him. I do

not know if he will actually construe my remark in

this way, however, but it seemed like an

opening

to use an important exile channel as a possible

deception mechanism.

AMBANG said he does not

believe there is any truth to the charge of financial

dishonesty levelled against Arcos.

Rene RODRIGUEZ Cruz (201-224329): AMBANG-1

as a compulsive, capable of doing harm

to anyone,

including Fidel Castro.

AMBANG1 knows

well but does not know his associate,

Carlos Laplace, who shows up in Mexico from time to

time.

I raised the matter of Rene RODRIGUEZ merely to

sound AMBANG out, but it may be he thinks we have

some special interest in him.

e.

About Osmani CIENFUEGOS (20T-270T64), AMBANC

stated

he was a member of the PSP

in the middle 1950'g.

He is a competent architect but otherwise a person of

limited capacity.

He is not a member of the inner

circle of the Old Guard PSP and never was.

He got

involved with the PSP out of opportunism,

he is a

schemer, self seeker and very unreliable.

f. I told AMBANG I had heard Emilio Aragones had

been arrested.

AMBANG was surprised and said he would

a great deal of interest in Miret, asking especially

why he should have been selected to make two recent

AMBANG did not have any idea.

the exile rumor mill as a person of special interest

to the Us, and thus to flesh out some of the other

parts of

h. Armando Hart (201-222675), according to

AMBANG, does not have the qualities of an adminis-

trator but he is very good at situating himself

politically,

and dealing.

as many say.

AMBANG regards Hart as a much

more decent

person than Aragones and to be well placed

in Aragone's old job because he does not have

notoriously close

connections with any of the

personalities or factions within the 26th of July

but gets along with them all.

i.

Concerning the differences between the city

and

sierra fighters in the 26th

they are real and that the city group fought and

suffered much

more.

AMBANG believes this is not the time for the

US or exiles to make menacing gestiues against Cuba,

for this would merely provide Castro with distractions

from internal problems

and perhaps enable him

to rally

popular support.

2.

I believe that later in the summer it might be a good

dea to have another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exil

hinking, and feeding more deception thought:

5. RAY stronily eupported the staled alma of CASTRO'

resolution, but he reportedly became incienaingly diaturbed about

Communlet infiltration of the government.

After the arrest and

Imprisonment of Huber MATOS In Ocroser 1999. RAY made bla

concern koown to CASTRO and was aubeequently dismiesed and

replaced by a Communlal. Between the time of his diamlosal and

October 1960, when he extilirated to the United States, RAY devoted

bie time to the organization of the Movimiento Revoluclonario de

proposed that a military junta be lormed in which each of the different

exile groupe would be represented and have a vote on the junts's

activities.

and insure against blatant failures. He was highly critical of bob

the invasion attempt of 1961 and with himeoll for giving his approval

to the operation. RAY fell that his new organization would be able

to avoid similar failuses. The new group was tormed at that time

and sas called the Juata Revolucionaria Cubana (JURE, Cliban

Revolutionary Junta).

Since the founding of the JURE, RAY has kept bio antie

un unnaned source of TBI-LA advised that office tha

called on hin in April and inguired as to the latter's ability to tura

and asked 1f (this FBI) source could

about 1,000 silencers, for use on 9 ma machine pistols, and

mant (very confidentially) for a customer in northern California.

Bubject implied for himelf ar earlier ascociation with Consolidated

Electrodynaice Corp., a ilghly reputable scientific instrumot mnuo

facturer, and with Aerojet General Corp., which we knuw to be dabbling

1n ordnanco specialtles. Subject also made reforence to some vague

Balos or business relatsonship with "the City of Commerce concern that

sus raided recently", undoubtedly Erquiage Arma Co.

2. YBI-lA feels it aust alert Custone on the off-chance that

subject may be exporting unis Item, and also that it cannot afford

not to advise the State of California Departnent of Juetice, since

mere possession of a allancer 1a a felony, and prior knowledge, ta

the event there was a major incident of uny kind, would be difficult

to explain.

Aly) wantod to know

whether we had any further information on the status of the

legal case ariains

from-the seizure of the armg being

manufactured for him by the Erquiaga Manufacturing Company.

He was told that we had receivod further information lud catin

that the case was undertaken by the state authoritles and

that there wore son irregularitlos Involved In the search

warrant.

Under the circumstances, we plan to take no action

to interfere with the legal process since it would appear that

the manufacturer has a very good case, and since federal

a Brat Chat

involvement with publicity hungry state authorities could lead

to totally counterproductive publicity and complications.

Al sald he understood and agreed.

He asked how long the

matter might be delajed.

He'

was advised that this would have

to be checked with the

manufacturer's attorney, but since the

seizure took place, it would appear that the court would have

to take prompt action to rule on ita legality. He was told

that a hearing was scheduled for 6 or 7 April

on the matter.

2.

He sald that he had chocked with his man in Costa

Rico

who had spoken with Prosident Orlich and with Daniel

unable to locate in his files the original purchase order for

the arms which was aigned by Oduber.

A/1 said that ho has a

signed copy in his possession.

Ho was advised not to nec thig

without checking with Oduber since its use might hurt Oduber'a

chances of winning the presidential elections.

would not use this paper since he agreed that the friondship

of the PLN 18 more important, even than the arms, which are the

key to his current plans.

I told him as far as we were able to determine

on the basis of incomplote information that the arms had

ernseized by the State of California and that their lega

right to effect the seizure is open to question. I. said I

could not give him more definite information because we

are awaiting word on the specifie statutory authority for

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Communication from AYBANG, 29 March 1965

AMBING (A) phoned (collect) from Puerto Rico

on 29 Narch 1965.

that the seizure

of arms being

manufactured for his organization by the ERQUIAGA Nanu-

facturing Company in the los Angeles area of California

was very damaging to his plans.

He said there sere some

493 submachine guns being manufactured by this company.

20

of these are for replacements for possibly defective guns.

He said each weapon is marked with a special mark and a

serial number which will make them attributable to his

organization.

He further said that the kuns were paid for

except for $9000. Erquinga left California about a month

ago with the job unfinished, and A sald that they had been

negotiating with Erquiaga's partner.

He did not give the

name of this individual.

He said that there was some ques

tion as to how much was

owed on the arms, but that the partner

had agreed

on the

$9000 figure.

2. A asked if we could arrange to have the arms released.

3.

that I would have to look into the legal

aspects of the

problem since the question of the title and

the charges under which they were confiscated would have to

be clarified.

I pointed out to A that if the title had not

yet passed to him despite his pasments, and if the charges

under which the arms were seized are valid, he might have no

other recourse

to recover the money paid.

4. A was very insistent that he must have those specific

because of

the markings and the importance of the

psychological effect that these would create.

I asked how long he would be in Puerto Rico and he

said he would remin a week or ten days.

I told him that I

could not give him an answer at this time,

and it was agreed

he would phone

me again on Thursday, I April.

6.

Immediately after this conversation, I contacted

Mr. Mayo Stunz.

in 00, who agreed to query his Los Angeles

office immediately to find out the legal status of the

seizure.
