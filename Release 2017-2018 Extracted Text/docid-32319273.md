DETAILS: By way of background, in October, 1993, the Information

Resources Division (IRD), which is tasked with meeting the FBI's

obligations under the Act, identified the need to have one of the

ICD CDRU teams assist the JFK Task Force since FOIPA Analysts,

beyond those already on the Task Force, were unavailable due to

responding to a voluminous number of court-ordered deadlines over

the next two years.

At the time, the Task Force was attempting

to begin and sustain the timely transfer to NARA of the one

million plus pages of FBI documents subject to transfer under the

Act.

The CDRU team was needed not only to help fill the need for

additional skilled document processing reviewers but, more

importantly, to provide the benefit of its very extensive

DETAILS: By memorandum dated 10/25/93, copy attached, you

requested that a Supervisory PLS Specialist from the Civil

Discovery Review Unit, and that supervisor's team be detailed to

the JFK Task Force for six months to assist in the review and

production of documents relating to the Kennedy assassination.

By addendum dated 11/1/93, LCD agreed to detail one team of PLSS

until 2/11/94.

on 1/28/94, we met to discuss the volume of work

remaining to be addressed by the JFK Task Force.

You requested

that the temporary detail of CDRU personnel be extended through

June, 1994.

Although I was unable to accommodate your request,

we have continued to discuss potential compromise positions with

your Deputy, Gary L. Stoops.

Recently, we agreed to the following compromise.

First, the entire

team

will be left in place through March, 1994,

to permit completion of the processing and production of the Lee

Harvey Oswald files. The team will be returned to CDRU on or

before 4/4/94.

Second, we have agreed to extend the detail of

PLSs Kevin VanHutton until 7/5/94, to permit him to train a

supervisor from among the IRD personnel assigned to the project.

Third, we have agreed to extend the detail of PLS Gary E. Emrick

and to detail PLS Joyce Hollman Taylor, an experienced senior

document reviewer, to the JFK Task Force, to assist PLS

VanHutton.

We have not yet agreed on a reporting date for PLS

Taylor, but we did agree

that she will be returned to LCD on

7/5/94, With PLSs VanHutton and Gary Emrick.

I trust this accurately reflects our agreement and is

satisfactory to you.
