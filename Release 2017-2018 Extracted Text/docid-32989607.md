ROBERT CARDIAN

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL

CINTERNAL SECURITY DIVISION

MEETING WITH THE DIRECTOR

11-25-70

In accordance with arrangements approved by the Director,

Mx. Mardian conferred with Ni. Hoover in Mr. Hoover's Office this morning..

At the outset of their meeting Mr. Hoover advised Mr. Mardian that the failure of

the Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice to take action on

numerous occasions where action was clearly indicated, based on the results of

FBI reports, has been of deep concern to the Bureau. The Director noted that

while prosecution is not the business of the FBI. that we are an investigative

agency, nevertheless there have been instances where reports contained results

of investigations thai clearly called for prosecutive action, and none was had.

Mr. Hoover observed that the Internal Security Division of the

Department of Justice.was one sector of the Department that was in bad need of

revitalizing. Mr. Mardian said that he was in total agreement with Mir. Hoover,

and that he, Mardian, intended to take appropriate action in this regard.

The Director noted that he hoped that matters concerning the.Black

Panthers, Students for a Democratic Society and the Weathermen would eventually

'be the responsibility of Mir. Mardian's Internal Security Division. Mardian indicated

that plans were going forward to do precisely this at the present time. •

Mr. Mardian observed that he intended to resolve all doubts

regarding prosecution of persons who have violated lawshaving a bearing on this

country's internal security in favor of prosecution wherever and whenever possible?

.....?.

In this regard Mr. Nardian advised that he intended to put together

a Task Force to develop new strategy and ideas for prosecuting people who represent

à threat to this country's internal security. He noted that he anticipated as the result

of this Task Force new legislation would be recommended where present legislation

is now inadequate, that efforts would be made to have prosecution where state laws.

M. A. Jones to Mr. Bishop Memo

RE: ROBERT C. MARDIAN... MEETING WITH THE DIRECTOR

that it has come to his attention that an indivaual designated by/Soviets to open

a consular office in San Francisco was ejected from Greece because of his espionage

activities.

The Director advised Mr. Mardian how he had-been misquoted with respect

to his views concerning the passage of the Consular Treaty noting that he never made

a statement opposing it, but merely cited the investigative problems that would be

encountered by the Bureau if the Russians were permitted to open consulates in

various parts of the United States.

The Director advised Mardian that he is firmly of the opinion that

toreign espionage agents, when found out, should be prosecuted and appropriately

punished for their activities. Mr. Mardian said he heartily agreed.

Mr. Hoover noted that in the past. the Department of Justice has

always yielded and deferred to State with espect to such matters. Mardian advised

that he hoped that this would change with his administration of the Internal Security

Division. The Director at this point noted the problems the Bureat has had in the

past even with the Internal Security Division in our efforts to get prompt replies

where inquiries have been made by the Bureau. Mardian stated it is his earnest

hope that he could effect_changes in the Internal Security Division which would preclude

problems of this sort in the future...

At this point in their conversation, Mr. Mardian stated he had two

matters that he wanted to mention to the Director concerning which he wished to

solicit the Director's cooperation and guidance.

He advised that he has been commissioned by the President to put

together an nerdepartmental Intelligence Unit for the purpose of pooling intormation

received from the various intelligence agencies and based on the evaluation of such

information, it is hoped that this Unit might eventually be able to predict with some

degree of accuracy, demonstrations, criminal acts which might be committed by

dissidents and others whose goals are inimical to our Government.

• For the purpose of establishing this Interdepartmental Intelligence Unit,

Mr: Mardian said he hoped that each intelligence organization to be included would

designate a "top man" who will work with the Unit. He indicated that the Unit will worn

out of the White House, that special space is being obtained in Federal office building

number seven adjacent to the White House and that Mr. John Ehrlichmann has

advised Mardian that an individual named Morell Sharp, a former Supreme Court

Justice from the State of Washington is being designated to work with the Unit for

the next six months pending his reappointment to the Supreme Bench in Washington,

it being noted that he lost his place on the Bench in the recent elections.

M. A. Jones to Mr. Bishop Memo

RE: ROBERT C. MARDIAN... MEETING WITH THE DIRECTOR

Mardian advised Mr. Hoover that Sharp is an excellent man with

outstanding credentials. Bufiles reflect no information on Sharp. He is currently

under investigation by the Bureau in connection with his appomtment as Consultant

to the Attorney General.

The Director assured Mr. Mardian of the Bureau's full cooperation

and indicated that a Bureau representative would be designated to work with the

Unit.

Mr.

Mardian Stated the second matter which he wished to mention

to the Director was the fact that he has also been commissioned by the White House

to form a Task Force tở decide what our Government's response will be should

there ever be a kidnaping of a Government official such as there was in Canada

recently. Mardian stated that it is his earnest hope that the Task Force, when it

is formed and confers, will recommend no response he made to the demands of would

be abductors and that this policy, if established, be given full disclosure in the press,

in the hope that it will serve as a deterrent..

In response to a request by Mardian for the Director's opinion

concerning this matter, the Director "noted that he shared Mardian's views and

felt that plans must be formulated in anticipation of possible kidnapings since it

is not realistic to take the position they will not occur in this country.

Just prior to the conclusion of their talk, Mr. Mardian expressed

concern over Frank Sinatra's recent association with Governor Ronald Reagan of

California and advised Mir. Hoover that efforts on his, Mardian's, part and those of

Lyn Nofziger, of the White House, to convince Reagan of Sinatra's unsavory

background have been met by disbelief.

Mr. Hoover noted that he is well acquainted with Governor Reagan

and that the next time he is in touch with him, he will brief him concerning Sinatra..

Mardian stated that he appreciates Mr. Hoover's offer to do this since, while

Reagan is not inclined to believe Mardian or Nofziger, even though they are close

friends, he most certainly will believe Mr. Hoover.

Mardian said that he is of the opinion that Reagan has sought a

relationship with Sinatra to dim his own image of being a right wing conservative.

Mardian noted that one of Reagan's biggest financial supporters, Taft Schreiber,

President of the Music Corporation of America, served as actor's agent to both

Reagan and Sinatra several years back.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

I sincerely enjoyed my conversation with you on

Wednesday and wish to thank you for so generously

giving me your time.

I have not contacted any of the departments and

agencies whose cooperation we hope to enlist in

connection with the government-wide intelligence

unit other than your Bureau and the Central Intelli

gence Agency. I think it would be helpful to have

your designee or designees named before making any

further contacts in order to have available your

advice with respect to which departments and agencies

should be included as well as those you deem unneces-

sary to include at this time.

In view of the fact that preliminarily, at least,

all we wish to do is discuss the subject very generally

jfor the purpose of assessing realistically the nature

and structure of the intelligence unit which we hope

to achieve, I am of the present opinion that the size

lof the initial group should be somewhat limited. I

would be grateful for your thoughts on this aspect of

It is noted that in incoming letter from Mr. Mardian

the identity of his reprecontative to the cantinned unit and

was also requested to furnish his advice concerning other

departments and agencies which should be included in such

the present opinion that the size should be somewhat limited.

In our reply to Mr. Mardian we are pointing out that we are also

in agreement that the size should be limited but will abide by

his decision regarding other agencies invited to participate.

Mr. Mardian also asked for the Director's thoughts

as to substantive matters to be resolved at such meetings. It

appears that it is certainly premature at this point to make

Re:

Intelligence Evaluation Committee

Internal Security - Miscellaneous

It was indicated that they had been given the

assignment to expeditiously form a committee to have

access to all intelligence in the Government concerning

political terrorists in the United scates in order to

I render evaluations to Messrs. Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and

Haldeman who in turn would advise the

President.

These

evaluations would be for the purpose of determining, but

necessarily limited to, such things as the severity of

the problem under study regarding various terroristic

groups and to make recommendations as to various options

which the President might take as to Federal response

concerning such problems.

The responses which were

mentioned as examples were legislation, prosecution,

and other measures designed to alert and prevent acts

of terrorism.

It was apparent that both Dean and Mardian

had not given any real thought to mechanics of the

operation of this proposed committee as evidenced by

the fact that during the meeting Mardian called the

Attorney General direct in order to ascertain who would

pay Judge Sharp's salary and what office space he would

temporarily occupy. During the discussion with Attorney

General Mitchell, Mardian was told by the Attorney General

that Sharp would be funded by the Justice Department and

that the committee which was being formed was to be

considered as operating under the

Justice Departnent's

auspices; however, arrangements were being made for space

in Federal: Office Building Number Seven which is near the

/White House.

After talking with the Attorney General, Mardian

further advised those present that it had originally been

indicated that the committee would be called "The White

House Intelligence Evaluation Committee" but because of

of possible publicity concerning this it was decided

by Attorney General Mitchell not to have White House

in the title and that it should operate under some

insignificant name as "Intelligence Evaluation

Committee" and in the event the press picked up any-

thing about its operation the response from Justice

would be that Justice Sharp was working with the

Department's Inter-Division Information Unit.

Mr. Mardian further informed that he had

purposely kept the initial meeting of the committee

small but felt that it should be enlarged to include

other Government agencies which cuuld make a con-

tribution and would have a definite interest in such

intelligence evaluations. In this regard, he stated

that the Attorney General was calling Secretary of

Defense Laird, Secretary of the Treasury Kennedy, and Vice

Admiral Noel A. M. Gayler of the National Security Agency

in order for them to have representatives at the next

meeting.

Mardian stressed that the President wanted

this committee set up as soon as possible in order

to become functional and for that reason he intended

to call a meeting early next week, at which time other

matters such as staffing and procedural plans would be

formulated.

It was observed that Mr. Mardian as well as

others present vill rely largely on the Bureau for the

intelligence product which will be furnished to this

committee for evaluation. In this regard, Doherty of the

Justice Department commented that the FBI has fumished

a tremendous amount of material regarding extremist

groups engaged in terroristic activities which is available

to the committee for analysis. Although no definite request

In the future as well as other Government agencies

depending upon the nature of the problem which will

be under study.

No mention was made either as to the staffing

of this committee but both Mardian and Dean indicated

that they contemplated a small nucleus of personnel

working directly with Justice Sharp from the member

agencies at least on a semipermanent basis. In this

connection, the Justice Department has assigned Doherty

the Committee. In this regard, Mr. Mardian stated that

following the initial meeting of the Committee on 12/3/70 he

reported back to Attomey General Mitchell at which time

Nix. Mitchell impressed upon Mardian the keen personal interest

of the President on a top prioxity basis in having the cap-

tioned Committee established and functioning in very short

order to an extent whereby the President can be assured of

getting..the very best intelligence available from all sources

within the Government in order to be in the best possible

position to decide action to be initiated and responses to

be made based upon such intelligence.

Mardian stated that

either he (Mardian) or Attorney General Mitchell had spoken

personally with heads of the agencies represented on captioned

Committee and had been assured their full cooperation.

Mr. Agil Krugh brought up the security factor involved

and cautioned everyone present that the White House wanted to make

certain that everything is done to prevent any leakage to the

press that this particular Committee is in existence. It was

reiterated that if any such inquiry is made by the press, Justice

Sharp or Mr. Mardian would handle such by stating the Committee

was operating under the Justice Department in connection with the

operations of the Inter-Divisional Information Unit (IDIU).

Mardian stated in fact this Committee has nothing whatever to

do with the IDIU but this response is for security cover purposes

only.

As the first step in carrying out the mission of the

Committee, each agency present was requested to submit a blind

memorandum (classified "For Eyes Only"') to Mir. Mardian by the

close barness centre containing a listing of

political terrorist groups vithin the United States, together

with a suggested list. Intelligence queries to be utilized

by the Committee in evaluating intelligence coverage of these

groups such as, the extent of foreign influence in each of the

terrorist groups and other similar inquiries.

to carry out his job. In this regard, he stated he desired

to know more about the intelligence operations of each agency

and would spend the next several weeks preparing himself in

A brief discussion was had concerning material sub

mitted by all agencies regarding (1) a list of political

terrorist groups in the United States (2) a list of proposed

intolligence meries to be utilized in evaluating intelligence

coverage of the groups and (3) a calendar of proposed extremist

events for the next six months. Mr. Doherty of Justice Sharp's

staff was instructed to prepare an engrossment of all agency

contributions so that the Committee at its next meeting could

establish priorities and undertake necessary intelligence

evaluations needed by the White House.

Mr. Dean of the White House commented specifically

concerning the calendar of extremist events (which was almost

totally composed of FBI submissions) and the Committee

recommended that any additions or deletions to this calendar

be brought to the Committee's attention on a continuing

basis.

As a matter of intèrest, Mr. Mardian was called from

Jewish Defense League were causing a great deal of concern

and the State Department was pressuring the Justice Department

to secure an injunction against the Defense League in order to

to a desk officer at the State Department, he feels that he is

talking "to the enemy."

This afternoon Judge Morell Sharp, Chairman of

captioned Committee on which I serve as the Director's

representative, called and stated that he would like to

advise me of a rather small problem which he realizes is

not within the FBI's jurisdiction but wanted to make it a

matter of record in our files.

The Judge stated that his Committee has just moved

into space in Federal Office Building #7 on Jackson Place and

this afternoon, around 1 p.M., a stranger very aggressively

came to the door and forced lis way in insisting upon using

the telephone. He indicated his name was Dr. Sandler (phonetic)

who is interested in nuclear studies and he proceeded to make

about four telephone calls looking for a Colonel John Sheffie

(phonetic) who was preparing some sort of study in which Sandler

was very much interested.

Judge Sharp's secretary, Mrs. Dohaney, was the only

person in the room when this stranger came in and she stated

that she was very much concerned about the security aspects

of the Committee in view of the fact that this individual

seemed very inquisitive and nosey in trying to find out the

identity of the group

currently occupying the space in that

particular room. It is noted that this space was previously

occupied by an executive study group which went by the name

o2 Atlantic-Pacific Interocean Study Group which is no longer

in existence. Mrs. Dohaney described Dr. Sandler as approxir

mately 6'1" tall,

age-middle 40's, dark brown, long, curly

hair, slender build, long fingers, aquiline nose, white race,

and well dressed.

Judge Sharp stated that he realizes that there is

nothing the FBI can do about this and, in fact, the stranger

was probably just seeking the free use of a Government tele-

the Judge is very security conscious and did not want something

like this to pass without the Bureau's knowing about it.

It was pointed out to Mr. Mardian that I could

not understand why he had not received the letter since

our records indicate it was sent on 1/27/71 and the letter

itself was dated 1/27/71. Upon being asked if I recalled

the letter's contents, I informed him that the Director

had pointed out therein that, because of our own manpower

11005%

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise of

the receipt of a draft copy of "proposed charter" of

captioned committee and to recommend that we respond by

restating Bureau's position that we cannot assist in its

staffing.

In my memorandum of 2/2/71 you were advised

that a "proposed charter" was being prepared which would

ultimately be submitted to heads of all participating

agencies for approval. We are now in receipt of a "draft:

of this paper which is attached. Each agency has been

furnished a copy for review and

suggested changes desired

at this point before the final paper is submitted.

An analysis of the draft shows that the "authority"

of the captioned committee is attributed to the Interdepart-

mental Action Plan for Civil Disturbance which was a plan

adopted by Departments of Defense and Justice in April, 1969,

for purpose of coordinating preparationsfor and responses to

serious civil disturbances which right thereafter occur within

the United States.

will be supported by a permanent intelligence estimation

staff consisting of representatives from member departments

and agencies. This is contrary to position which we have

taken in our letter dated 1/27/71 in which we stated that

we could not provide assistance in staffing a working group

because of manpower and budgetary problems.

Accordingly, it is felt that we should once again

point out our position in this regard and request that

appropriate wording be set forth in the paragraph entitled

"Staff" to clearly show that the proposed permanent

intelligence estimation staff will not be composed of

employees from the FBI.

The stated functions of the permanent staff

consisting of intelligence dissemination, estimate

preparation, information gap identification and preparation

of other relevant studies as directed by the committee

appear to be in line with the committee's overall mission

and contain nothing which we should take issue with.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached letter be sent to Assistant

Attorney General Robert C. Mardian requesting that the

wording of the "proposed charter" be changed to clearly

show the FBI will not provide personnel for the proposed

permanent intelligence estimation start.

The letter

reiterates our full support in providing intelligence to

assist the committee in fulfilling its responsibilities.

the Bureau would desire to make a security "sweep" of the space

occupied by the Committee in the Internal Security Division of

This morning Mr. John F. Doherty, Executive Director

of the captioned Committee, contacted me and advised that the

is located on the 4th floor of the same building in which the

stated that since much of the information which will come into

to give the space a thorough security "sweep" both physically

Jr. C. D. Brenna

DATE: 2/22/71"

FROM : R, D. Cotter

SUBJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Mr. G. C. Moore's memorandum, 2/19/71, reported !

that the Executive Director of captioned Committee hao

furnished three intelligence estimates, prepared by the

Committee for Bureau comments®

Mr. Moore is to discuss the

documents at the next meeting of the Committee.

"May 1971 Demonstrations." The first estimate

is entitled "May 1971 Demonstrations" and concludes thatlit is

too early to predict the size of the demonstratiors scheduled

for Washington, D. C., the first week in May. As previously

reported, these demonstrations are being sponsored by the

Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice. Some officials

oi the coalition, particularly Rennie Davis, have veei

calling for a shutdown of Washington, D. C., on one day oi

the demonstrations,

probably May 5.

The Committee's conclusions

state that the Coalition has publicly announced the intent to

block the flow of traffic into Washington, D. C., the Pentagon,

and the Central Intelligence Agency.

Observations

•We agree that it is too early to predict the size

of the demonstrations scheduled for May 1971. We also agree

that vandalism may take place during the demonstrations.

It

should be noted, however, that during a meeting of the Coalition's

Continuation Committee last January, members of the Committee

voted against disrupting

; the flow of traffic into Washington, D. C..

However,

extremists among the demonstrators could still attempt

to

do this inasmuch as Davis has given considerable publicity

to this plan.

""?"

"Estimate of. Likelihood of New Momentum on the

Antiwar Activities and forces in View of the Laos and Cambodiän

Situation."

This estimate, captioned as above, concludes that

military action in Laos or Cambodia will give new impetus,

purpose and unity to the antiwar movement and the protest

(activities will be stimulated.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

Observations

We concur with this conclusion. It should be noted

that antivar demonstrations have increased measurably since

the military action began in Laos.

For example, on 2/10

demonstrations were held in over 60 cities

throughout the

¡United States. It should be noted that in its background

information on this conclusion, the Committee mentions the

"National Student Movement' in connection with the recent

Student Mobilization Committee antivar conference at Catholic

University.

The way this is written leaves the impression

that there is an organized group called the National Student

Movement which is, of course, inaccurate.

3. "Likelihood of Kidnaping of Any High U.S. Govern-

ment Official in the Immediate Future by Political Terrorists."

This estimate, cantioned as ahove, concludes that kidnaping of

a high government official must be considered a definite proba

¡bility by extremist elements.

Observations

We concur with this conclusion. It should be noted

that the background material submitted by the Committee

supporting this conclusion states that violence-prone groups

such as the Black Panther Party and the Weatherman have endorsed

political kidnaping.

We do not have information that the

Weatherman has endorsed kidnapings although it has called for

assassinations for political purposes.

ACTION:

If you approve, Inspector G. C. Moore, who represents

the Bureau on the Intelligence Evaluation Committee,

will make

the above observations when these

estimates are considered by

-

the Committee.

RE:

62-113887

The Committee staff is preparing guidelines which will be

issued to each of the agencies making up the Committee in

order to have individual draft estimates prepared. (Upon

receipt, the request will be analyzed and submitted for

approval prior to our undertaking preparation of estimate).

Mr. Mardian expressed his concern over the fact that

the staff of the Committee is not large enough to prepare the

intelligence estimates needed to carry out the mission of the

Committee. In this regard he stated he is in receipt of a

letter from the Department of Defense indicating that since the

FBI is not furnishing personnel to the Committee's working

group, Department of Defense also will be unable to furnish

personnel in the future.

Mr. Mardian stated that this leaves

the working staff composed merely of representatives from

the Internal Serrity Division of the Department, Secret

Service, National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence

Agency.

He expressed the hope that something could be done

in the near future to fully staff this group in view of the

obvious increased activity on the part of militant groups and

individuals in the country.

also pointed out that the IPAC had absolutely refused to

change the date as it was under orders from the Socialist

Workers Party (SWP) to hold the denonstration on April 24

to demonstrate its control of a large segment of the peace

At first, delegates to the neeting decided to only

- from

leaders of Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam

(ChCV) and

the ArSC, agreed to cosponsor the April 24 demon

Rennie Davin and his followers fought against

cooperating with the NPAC.

Davis ielt that the April 24

demonstration will lossen the effect of the lay demon

Etrations as people will not remain in Washingion after the

Apxil 24 demonatration.

Delegates to the meeting confronted Davis on the

fact ho has urged militant tactios, such as blocking access

roads to Washington and the Pentagon. Davis contended hat

his group has no intention of "breaking with nonviolent

traditions" but that "nore croative actions" will be necessary

The Committee docided that

Davis' plan

to block accoss to lashingion and the Pentagon

would defeat the PCPJ's attempt to win vidospread support

from the public.

It was docided, however, that acceptable

tactics can include mass arrests, mass assemblies, intonsive

picketing, and boycotting.

The Committee also decided that

provocative actions, such as harassing police and "trashing,"

wild not be allowed.

At a press conference on March 2, David Dellinger,.

an official of the POPJ, announced the Peps is supporting

On Hay 5, a nationwide moratorium on "business

United States. Dollinger stressod these are general plans

and

that specitios remain to be developed.

The Continuations Committee willmake further

-plans at its next meeting on March 13.

CONCLUSION/ CONkENT

The NPAC, by refusing to consider changing the

date of the April 24 demonstration, has forced the PePS to

cosponsor its demonstration.

A largo turnout of demon-

strators on April 24 may naterially reduce the number of

denonstrators participating in the PCPJ activities following

that denonetration. It is unltkely that a large number of

demonstrators will remain in lashington for two weeks

following the activity on April 24.

nonviolent demonstrations, it should be noted that extremisi

elemenis have, in the pasi, paid little attention to such

pleas. Davis

has given wide publicity to his plans to

paralyze the lashington, D. C., area.

These plans are

attractive to his followers and may well be executed y

then. It should also be noted that Dellinger pointed out

that spocitics remain to be developed.

The next meeting of

the PCPJ should result in more concrete plans.

as planning for these demonstrations is still taking place.)

It also concludes that the demonstration on 4/24/71 will

probably reduce participation in subsequent demonstrations

It is also concluded that

these demonstrations will be similar to past major demon-

a small number of participants have engaged in vandalism and

other destructive acts.

The Director asked for our views on attached memorandum öf

that the Bureau should have no objection to "Estimate E-1, Revision 2,

April - May Demonstrations, April 5, 1971, " also attached, prepared by

the Intelligence Evaluation Committee.

I have read the entire estimate and find it a concise and

informative statement of what may be expected both at home and abroad

in connection with the forthcoming April and May demonstrations. The

information appears to be correct insofar as can be judged by that which

has previously come to my attention. It is true, as the Domestic

Intelligence Division observes, that the number of participants and the

extent of civil disobedience are still tentative, but that seems unavoidaole

at this time because the organizing groups are still in the planning stage.

COMMITTEE (IEC)

D. C.,

beginning 4/24/71.

The estimate states that it will

be distributed by the Committee unless members of the IDC,

of which the Bureau is one, object.

The estimate concludes

that it is extremely difficult

to adequately predict the size of the April 24, 1971 demon-

strations, but indications are that attendance

will be over

It also concludes that strong efforts

are being made

by groups tenoring disruption to rally support for the evenis

scheduled April 25 - May; extensive aisruption has been

planned by some factions which are likely to be beyona the

control of the organizers' leadership.

It announces that

disruptions will include blocking of key bridges and major

traffic arteries; sit-ins and interference with the work of

Government employees, as well as the possibility of "knocking

out" the telephone system, having Radio Hanoi announce a

state of insurrection and martial law in Washington, D.C.,

and

the cutting of all power sources in the Capital.

The estimate

notes that

a spokesman for People's Coalition for Peace and

Justice (PCPJ) has indicated it will take Federal troops to

prevent use of Rock Creek Park as a campsite.

A major

conclusion in the estimate is that the key to the extent and

tone of the April - May demonstration lies in the response

of students to the proposal that they be prepared to stay

in Washington for at deast a week.

Inspector George C. Moore discussed with the Executive

Director of the Committee today methods and standards of the

operation of the Committee staff.

The staff reviews a voluminous

amount of intelligence data received from the intelligence

community, does research, and prepares estimates for dissemina-

tion to the White House and other high officials within the

| Executive Branch. What the Committee needs are Bureau personnel

who are well intormed

_regarding exiremist activities across-the-

board in the domestic field, Bureau coverage and resources

regarding violent demonstrations and agitation in antiwar and

racial fields, and especially personnel who have expertise in

analysis and research.

It is felt that the following Agents would be ideally

suited to handle this assignment and would be well qualified not

only for Committee purposes but to protect the Bureau's best

interests: 1) Section Chief Richard D. Cotter of Research Section,

Domestic Intelligence Division; and 2) Supervisor Garnett I. Tunstall,

a wealth of experience in research matters and his Section has

been coordinating the intelligence gathering functions with

respect to extremist groups.

It is noted that staff members

from other agencies represented on the Committee are in grades

GS-15 to GS-17 and it is believed an individual of similar

stature should represent the Bureau. It is noted that Cotter

suffered a heart attack in September, 1970, and is currently

on limited duty. However, he has made a good recovery from

this coronary, is now working on a full-time basis, and there

lis no reason why he cannot handle this Committee.

Also, if the Director so desires, Cotter will be in a

position to assume the increasing administrative liaison functions

between the Committee staff and the Bureau, which would relieve

Inspector George C. Moore of these duties currently being

handled by him. Inspector More, of course, would still be the

Director's representative on the IC itself (distinguished from

(the working staff).

The IEC staff is located in the same building as

Domestic Intelligence Division and accordingly Section Chief

Cotter will be

able to stay in close touch with the operations

jof his Section.

With regard to Supervisor Tunstall, he has been an

Agent for some 24 years, including the last three years at the

Seat of Government in Racial Intelligence Section where he is

presently serving as GS-14

SUBJECT: INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

DATE: 711y 15-1971

To recommend that the attached letter and enclosures

be furnished to Mr. John F. Doherty, Executive Director of the EC.

As you have been previously advised by memorandum of

R. D. Cotter to C. D. Brennan, 6/24/71, same title, Mr. Doherty

requested information we have on the subject of "The

Interrelationship of Arab Terrorist Groups and U.S. Black

Militants." The IEC with the concurrence of the White House is

scheduling an intelligence estimate on that subject.

American black extremists have established a close

relationship with Arab terrorist groups; much anti-Semitic and

anti-Zionist propaganda has appeared in the black extremist press

and. complete support of the Palestinian "liberation struggle" has

been expressed by black extremists in this country.

Two groups containing black extremists and/or subversives

have traveled to the Middle East in the past year. The groups

ostensibly were to observe the situation and return to the U.s.

to propagandize on behalf of the Arabs but both reportedly visited

Arab guerrilla camps and one group was trained in the use of

handguns, rifles, and explosives. One member of this latter group

claimed members of that group were expected to commit acts of

terrorism when they returned to this country. Others of the

group have denied receiving such instruction but members of this

group have engaged in firearms training upon their return to this

country. Both groups have engaged in propaganda efforts. on behalf:

Loof the Arabs."

No information has been received to date to indicate

that any members of the two groups who visited the Middle East

have engaged in terrorist

activities in the U.s.

Mr. Mardian stated that he had just returned from

seeing the President in San clemente and that, as a result

of his visit with Mr. Nixon, he was charging the I

new project; namely? a comprehensive report on the United

States Government's treatment of classified and sensitive

information along with such corollary problems as how "Tof

secret clearances are granted, whether we need to tighter

up our security procedures, and whether there is too much

classification of documents under our current system. Mardian

noted that this study was triggered by the Ellsberg case but

he was not asking the Committee to review the Ellsberg investi-

gation. as such. He said that President Nixon was most concerned

regarding the Pentagon. Papers incident and the serious situation

created by Supreme Court decisions relating to the Ellsberg

case. Mardian

said that the'President wanted the Committee

to conduct an overall, comprehensive review of all the factors

relating to classification and protection of national defense

Re:

Mardian reviewed briefly the various ongoing studies

which are already underway by other agencies relating to this

general matter.

These include a study being made by Assistant

Attorney General Rehnquist regarding classification

and de-

classification procedures (pursuant to National Security Council

Directive 117 of January, 1971); a Department of Defense damage

estimate dealing with the Ellsberg and related disclosures; a

Defense Department study on security management and clearances

at the Rand Corporation; and a Defense Department review of

the origin and development of the entire "McNamara Study" on

which the so-called Pentagon Papers were based. Mardian said

that the result of all these studies would be funneled to the

IEC on a continuing basis and that the committee woulù lave

access to any other information it might need from any component

of the Executive Branch.

Marian also pointed out that several Congressional

investigations will be conducted concerning the Pentagon Papers

and related developments. He said that one in particular, by

the House Armed Services Committee, will be a penetrative study

and will have the full cooperation of the Executive Branch.

He asked that this information be closely held. Mardian said

that an exact definition of the objectives of the IEC in

connection with this study should be worked out by the Committee

Staff in the near future in line with the capabilities of the

white House; intercession, and that the IEC study will-be

As an example of this, Mardian noted that the

Committee should look into the question of former Presidents

In answer to a question, Mardian said that no

noted that it would depend in large measure on the

Committee's

receipt of input from current reviews being made by Defense

Department and Justice.

Mardian said that he was well aware

this job is a complex and difficult one but stressed that he

felt that it could be of great value to the White House and

the Executive Branch generally and that this study alone

clearances and procedures as typified by disclosures made

in the Ellsberg case.

On 7/22/71 the working staff of the IEC met to con-

Re:

It was agreed that special attention should be

devoted to the possibilities of unauthorized disclosure

of classified information being made through the dissem-

ination and handling of such data by non-Government

agencies especially private contractors or subcontractors

who are granted access to sensitive data in connection

with Government projects. The IEC will focus particularly

on such contractors who deal in study projects and policy

matters such as the Rand Corporation and similar "think

tanks." As a matter of fact the starting point for the

IEC will be an examination of the Government's relation-

ship to Rand and a review of policies and practices of

Rand in handling classified information and granting

access to it. (In this connection IEC will obtain copies

of ongoing studies currently being conducted by Defense

Department.) From there the IEC study will branch out

to cover similar private organizations with access to

glassitied information, with the objective of reconnend.

ing specific measures to tighten security gaps and fore-

stall a recurrence of the Ellsberg fiasco.

Reference my memorandum earlier today reporting

that former Bureau Agent Gordon Liddy would be serving in

a liaison capacity between the White House and the IC.

Bureau files show that George Gordon Liddy served

as a Special Agent in the FBI from 9/30/57 until he resigned

9/4/62. Liddy served in two field offices and in August,

1961, was transferred to the Seat of Government and was

l assigned to the Crime Records Division.

He had a fine

record in the Bureau and he resigned in 1962 to enies iaw

practice with his father in New York. In 1968 Liddy ran

forthe Republican ticket for Congressman of the 28th District

of New York but lost in a close primary race to Congressman

Hamilton Fish, Jr. Liddy has made it clear he is a con-

servative Republican and a staunch supporter of the Bureau

and the Nixon Administration.

In early 1969 Liddy was

appointed Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury

to work in the field of organized crime. Liddy is on the

Special Correspondents' List and we have had cordial

correspondence with him since his resignation.

Reference my memorandum reporting that the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee (IEC) was suspending its other assignments to

concentrate its attention on the problem of gaps in U. S. security

procedures as shown by the recent Pentagon Papers disclosures.

At a meeting of the IEC this morning Mr. John F. Doherty,

Executive Director, advised that he had just attended a meeting in the

office of Assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian, Internal Security

Division.

Mr. Mardian advised that President Nixon was keenly concerned

with regard to the whole question of leaks of security information, not only

as shown by the Ellsberg matter but also several other recent leaks.

'Mardian said that the President is appointing a representative from the

White House Staff to work directly with the IEC in conducting its inquiries.

This representative will be Gordon Liddy, a former FBI Agent who is

currently employed by the White House Staff. In fact, hereatter the lEC

will no longer report directly to Mardian but will report to the White House

through Mr. Liddy. Files have been called regarding Liddy and a memorandum

will be prepared setting forth a brief resume of his background.:

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

DATE: 7/29/71

This memorandum recommends that Section Chief)

Richard D. Cotter who has been serving on the working

staff of captioned Committee since 6/1/71 be designated

to replace Inspector George C. Moore as the Bureau's

representative on the Committee itself.

When this Committee was first set up in late

1970, the Director designated Inspector Moore as the

Bureau's representative.

Subsequently, in response to

a specific request by the Attorney General, the Director

approved assigment to the Committee's workiuy sidif of

two Bureau representatives including Section Chief Cotter.

Since his assignment to the IEC staff; Cotter

has devoted a great majority of his time to this assign-

ment. As reported in previous memoranda, the IEC has

been requested by the White House to consider various

aspects of security leaks typified by the Ellsberg case.

The IC will play a major role in drawing together and

correlating the various studies which have been under-

taken by different agencies as an outgrowth of the

"Pentagon Papers" disclosures. Moreover, the Committee

will now be reporting directly to a White House repre

sentative, Mr. Gordon Liddy.

Accordingly, it is believed

Cotter will be occupied on a full time basis, for the,

foreseeable

future.

Recently,

in Inspector "Moore's absence for a

West Coast speech, Cotter represented the Bureau at a

meeting of the IC.

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

Reference prior memoranda advising that the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee (IEC) has been asked to prepare for the White House

a summary regarding the problem of unauthorized disclosures of classified

information together with appropriate recommendations.

For your information, a meeting of the working staff of the

IEC was held on the afternoon of 8/12/71 at which time a tentative outline

was drawn up to define the specific areas into which the IEC will inquire.

It mas decided that the principal aim di te IEC repuri wili ve io deveiop

recommendations as to (l) whether dissemination of classified information

should be more restrictive than under current practices and (2) whether

additional steps are needed to insure the reliability and trustworthiness of

individuals who hold access.

The IEC study will concentrate on questions involving personnel

security and access rather than with matters relating to physical security

or administrative handling of files, mail_ etc. It will show the great

complexity and magnitude of the problem of properly controling classified

information without resorting to undemocratic methods. The study will

focus on the problems arising from the disclosure of classified data to

individuals and firms outside the Executive Branch under various industrial

and scientific contracts.

We will particularly take a close look at the

Rand Corporation and other "think!' type groups.

The TEC lso plans to cover in general terms problems arising

from leaks to the press.

The report will emphasize the difficulties encountered

in identifying persons responsible for such leaks and in prosecuting them

it will stress the fact that the only real answer to such leaks lies in tight

..

administrative controls and discipline within each Federal agency, a position

which has lone been advocated by the Bureau and the Director.

25 2l 9r The report will conclude with specific recommendations,as.to

practical actions which can be taken either by the White House or by individual

agencietito improve the situation.

the Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice, the National Peace

Attached is a draft of the proposed report on

and policies which relate to this

matter; summarizes the

pertinent executive orders and directives relating to this

issue and comments on their effectiveness; sets forth the

major lessons learned from the "Pentagon Papers" fiasco;

and lists specific recommendations to tighten Government

security and better protect classified data.

Recommendations include a conclusion that all

involving classified data and that such releases should

first be cleared by appropriate intelligence or security

personnel' to assure that it is sanitized. Recommendation

was also made that contacts with news media should be

tightly controlled with clearly defined procedures and a

central office to handle press contacts.

In addition, a

recommendation was made that all contacts with news media,

should be undertaken by the agency involved. It has always

been the Bureau's position that the ultimate answer to

leaks lies in tight administrative control and internal

discipline within the various agencies.

The report also calls for improved security

training and orientation programs both within the Government

and private industries handling classified material and

for tougher security inspections. This report specifically

deplores the practices of some Government officials retaining

classified documents as "private papers" and urges that an

executive directive be issued prohibiting this practice.

From the above, it can be seen that in large

measure this report reflects views long held by the

Director and recommends practices which already are Fo1-

lowed by the FBI. It is believed this report is an excellent

• statement of the problem of unauthorized disclosures and

that it contains a number of hard-hitting and effective

recommendations to improve the situation. The IEC staff

is to take up this report at a meeting on 10/26/71. At

7. That the practice of some Government

threat to security and should be prohibited.

8. That clearances to employees of

9. That appropriate Federal statutes be

It is felt this report represents an excellent

summary of the overall problem and that the above-cited

recommendations would, if carried out, drastically improve

-roverall Government security.: To be effective, of course,

a continuing interest of this problem by top-level officials

is essential, including. a willingness to allocate funds and

other resources where needed. No action on the part of the

Bureau is needed at this time. As a matter of fact, the

DATE: 11/18/21

(IEC

Mx. John W. Dean III, Counsel to the President,

has requested that IEC conduct an in-depth study of the

plans and strategies of the "militant left vis a vis the

labor movement." This request was prompted by a news-

letter emphasizing the need for worker-student alliances

which was prepared by the Revolutionary Marxist Caucus,

an adjunct of the Spartacist League. To a great extent,

of course, this study will depend upon information fur-

nished by the Bureau.

In line with the above, Bureau will furnish

background data regarding attempts of the militant left,

both black and white, to exert influence and draw strength

from the American Labor Movement.

This data, available

in Bureau files, will include a brief history of the

communist movement, both Chinese and Soviet oriented, as

related to the role of labor in the movement with special

emphasis placed upon plans and strategies of New Left and

black extremist groups.

A brief summary will be included regarding the

various splinter groups and their plans to infiltrate and

use the labor movement in furthering their various causes.

The study will be maints concerned with current activities.

When cumpised, the above Intormation will be

prepared by the Bureau's representatives on IEC and sub-

mitted for your approval. The data will then be incor-

House.

In addition to such obvious categories falling

example would be the organization and composition of the

Soviet intelligence services together with information

regarding Soviet intelligence capabilities, overall objectives,

specific targets, modus operandi, communications, security

practices, and similar information which is of value in our

counterintelligence operations.

We should also include any

items which, although not relating to a hostile or communist

country, could have a bearing on our activities. An example

might be information regarding the reliability or capabilities

of friendly foreign intelligence services with which the

Bureau deals.

All sections of the. Domestic Intelligence Division

are being canvassed and an overall list of this Division's

In addition to the needs of the Bureau in the security field,

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (TEC)

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

By memorandum, R. D. Cotter to Mr. E. S. Miller, dated 11/5/71, the

• Laboratory was requested to submit observations on any national security hazards

posed by/'phone phreaking, " the use of telephone lines by private individuals who

are familiar with various signalling systems employed by the telephone company.

Reference memorandum was precipitated by an article in the October, 1971, issue

of Esquire magazine by Ron Rosenbaum, captioned "Secrets of the Little Blue Box."

The term/"blue box" is applied to a tone signalling device which

generates tones normally used by toll operators and telephone switching equipment to

initiate and dial long distance calls within the telephone direct distance dialing network

(DDD). The Laboratory has been familiar with "blue boxes" for many years.

A

number of 'blue boxes" submitted by thu fiold have been examined in the Laboratory.

"Phone phreaks" are individuals who are either technically competent to build a

"blue box" or have obtained one from some source and who amuse themselves by

using the 'blue box'' to make toll-free calls within the DDD network. Some 'blue

boxes" are known to have been used by gamblers to make toll-free calls that

normally produce no record of the call to telephone company billing equipment. In

a recent Title III court-authorized wiretap in Las Vegas, interceptions were made of

a "blue box" so used.

The Laboratory is of the opinion that "blue boxes" do not pose any

substantial national security threat to telephone communications. A "blue box"' could

be used to initiate a single long distance call thereby tying up a single calling path,

but it is not felt likely that a sufficient number of "blue boxes" could be operated

independently to tie up enough single channels to materially effect the toll network.

Memorandum to Mr. Conrad

RE: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

The Bell System and most independent telephone companies do not provide

dial accessible busy verification codes to allow dialing into a call in progress, which

could be a simple method of wiretapping.

Various defense telephone networks which are accessible by DDD have

an operator intercept such calls and handle dialing within the network.

While the Laboratory does not have information on many computer

systems accessible by telephone dialing, such systems as NCIC, which is the center

of a dedicated network, appear to have adequate safe guards to prevent unauthorized

use or manipulation of data stored in; the computer.

While it is felt that the "blue box" and "phone phreaking" do not at this

time pose any national securiiy threat pased on availabie iniormation, it would behoove

the major telephone companies to continually review their vast switching systems as to

susceptibility to unauthorized access to insure that new features do not inadvertently

open a door which could effect essential telephone communications. ..

None. For information

Mr. Bernard A. Wells, Executive Director of

levied on the IEC on 1/19/72 by the Honorable John Dean,

Counsel to the President.

Mr. Dean said that the White House desires that the

IEC prepare regular reports regarding potential disruptions

fat both torthcoming national political conventions based on

information supplied by member agencies.

Mr. Dean toid wells that beginning immediately they

would like to get monthly reports on the Republican Convention

in San Diego, 8/21-24/72, and the Democratic Convention in

Miami Beach, 7/10-13/72. Beginning about May, the White House

desires biweekly reports and reports on a weekly basis beginning

about 7/1/72. Mr. Dean told Wells that the White House would

expect the IEC to serve as a focal point for pertinent infor-

mation as to possible disturbances at the

two political conventions

The IEC has for some time been collecting information

concerning the two major conventions, both of a public source

develop into violence despite announced peaceful intentions.

San Diego has been relatively free of demonstrations in the

past, but the Republican Convention will serve as a magnet,

drawing large nunbers of youth to the city for the Convention

including "street people" and others experienced in militant

disruptions.

All Bureau information incorporated in the attached

report has been previously disseminated in letterhead memorandum

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1) That attached draft be approved.

2) That appropriate sections of Domestic Intelligence

Reference prior memoranda advising or request

levied on IEC by the White House for regular reports regard-

ing potential disruptions at both forthcoming national

political conventions.

Attached is a copy of the latest IEC report dated

3-13-72, concerning possible disruptions at the Democratic

1972. In summary, this report shows interest in the

National Convention to be held in Miami, Florida, in July,

Convention by national dissident groups appears to have

increased during the past month. The Youth International

Party is planning various types of demonsciatiuns and activ

ities to be held prior to the Convention but leading up to

a culmination in Miami during the Democratic Convention.

The Congress of African Peoples had a meeting in February,

1972, and discussed plans for disruption on the Convention,

National leaders of this organization and those of other

dissident groups have expressed an interest in disrupting

the Convention. Very little planning for such disruptions

by these dissident groups is being done on a local level.

The last paragraphs of this report under the

caption of "Law Enforcement Planning" show that the Bureau

and the United States Secret Service are participating

with state and local agencies in preparations for possible

disruptions at the Democratic National Convention.

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

Reference prior memoranda advising of request

political conventions.

Attached is a copy of the latest IEC report dated

3-27-72, regarding potential disruptions at the Republican

National Convention (RNC) to be held in San Diego, California,

8/21-24/72. This report shows that on a national scale such . -

organizations as the Youth International Party (YIPPIES) , "

Vietnam Veterans Against the war, and the Red Balloon

Collective plan to participate in demonstrations at San Diego, /

but definite plans are slow in being formulated. Election

Year Strategy Information Center, formed by nationally known

dissidents such as Rennie Davis, Jerry Rubin, Stu Albert, and

John Lennon is no longer a functioning group; however, a new

group has been formed by these individuals which is known as

Youth Election Strategy. The apparent purpose of group is

to raise funds for demonstrations at the RNC.

According to report, on the local scene two major

groups have apparently decided to work together to coordinate

demonstrations. Leader of United Farm Workers Union has

promised 25,000 farm workers for a demonstration, and other

Local groups

are joining in plans for demonstrations against

the RNC.

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

Observations set out in attached report state

that while it is claimed demonstrations will be nonviolent,

plans are being made to obtain bail bond funds, indicating

civil disobedience and/or violent confrontations are

expected. Prospectsof massive demonstrations have been

enhanced by farm workers' promise to furnish 25,000 for

demonstration. This action will probably draw support from

the large Mexican-American population in southern California.

Report concludes law enforcement task force

established to coordinate local, state, and Federal law

enforcement agencies, continues to hold regular meetings

and formulate plans to deal with major contingency situa-

tions which may arise during RNC.

in our counterintelligence operations.

We should also

include any items which, although not relating to a hostile

Reference prior memorandum of 3-31-72 by which all

sections of the Domestic Intelligence Division and the

Organized Crime Section of the Special Investigative Division

were requested to furnish intelligence requirements needed

by the Bureau in order to fulfill its duties. As stated in

referenced memorandum, the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board (FIAB) in furtherance of the President's

extremists and revolutionary domestic groups and to the

local activities of groups attempting to disrupt and/or

harass legitimate Government activities, as well as organized

crime, bombings and Antiriot Law violations. The great

majority of these requirements are satisfied by the Bureau

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

On the local scene, the San Diego Convention

Coalition is beset with serious internal problems, and

-the Community Congress of San Diego has announced estab-

lishment of a group to provide for medical, legal, housing

and other aid for the demonstrators. Unsubstantiated

information indicates dissident elements have formed

battle plans for rioting and accelerated violence,

including bombing; however, these reports appear to be

only grandiose schemes of individuals who do not have

sufficient backing to accomplish substantial disturbances.

On the international scene, the San Diego

Convention Coalition has received a letter of support from

the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the American

People, a quasi-official organization of the North

Vietnamese Government.

General law enforcement task force continues to

hold meetings, but in view of possible change of location,

San Diego Police Department is holding further plans for

, the Convention in abeyance.

Mr. Bernard A. Wells, Executive Director, IEC, has

advised that the White House has expressed an interest in

being advised of the plans and the disturbance potential of

demonstrations scheduled for May 27 for Washington, D. C.

support of European colonialist rule in Southern Africa,

including present situation in Rhodesia. They are sponsored

by the African Liberation Day Coordinating Committee, a group

composed of pan-African organizations and the congrace of

African Peoples. Individuals involved in these demonstrations

are expected to range from the most militant to high-level

civil rights leaders. They are expected to draw support from

all levels of the black community and could easily involve

violence.

In view of the violence potential of the above

demonstrations, the IC, in accordance with the White House

request, is obtaining all available information concerning

the plans for these demonstrations from the member agencies

Of IEC. Information developed by the Bureau will be furnished

to IC by the Bureau's representatives and will be included in

the overall reports submitted to the white House.

5-22-72

The White House has requested an evaluation be

prepared by IC setting out the plans and disturbance poten-

tial of the May 27, 1972, African Liberation Day demonstra-

tion in Washington, D. C. By memorandum dated 5-8-72, approval

was received for Bureau representatives on the IC to furnish

the Committee information concerning this demonstration.

Attached is the initial IEC report in which the

disturbance poleniial of the demonstration is rated as high

in view of the extremist individuals and organizations involved

in its planning. The Committee feels that although the

demonstration may not reach the attendance figure of 10,000

as predicted by its leaders, there will be sufficient numbers

to present a potential for violence.

Led by such individuals as Leroi Jones; Howard Fullei,

and extremist leaders of the Black Panther Party and the

Republic of New Africa, and focused against such targets as

the South African, Rhodesian and Portuguese Embassies, the

individual participants could easily be incited to commit acts

of destruction, as well

as confrontation with law enforcement

officers.

An additional evaluation will be submitted prior

to the demonstration when a check of transportation sources

will give a more realistic indicationas to the number of

52016

participants coming from outside the City.

August, 1972. This report points out that organizations are

beginning to form which are focusing their attention on the

Miami Beach site for the Republican Convention. Leaders of

groups formerly planning demonstrations at the San Diego

site are now joining with East Coast groups and are in the:'

process of forming the Miami Conventions Coalition (MCC) to

prepare for protest at both national political conventions.

Attached report observes that a recent meeting in

Washington, D. C., of leaders has indicated the formation

of the MCC and the apparent opposition of Rennie Davis and

his militant Anti-war Union to peaceful demonstrations.

Auyust, 1972. This report concludes that curcently the

potential for disruptions at the Republican National Convention

is substantial in view of recent information indicating that

most protest groups will place the greatest emphasis on this

Convention. The report points out that leaders of various

protest groups who recently met in Washington, D. C., have

begun preparations for protests at both conventions and that

• the Vietnam Veterans Against the War will attempt to bring

about confrontations with the police in Miami

Beach.

The Youth International Party has secured housing

and office space in Miami Beach in preparation for both

conventions. The report also points out the emergence of

opposition to protest demonstrations by Cuban exile groups,

i many of whose members are armed. This fact alone increases

greatly the potential for violence.

The attached report also

indicates that dissension and factionalism; which exists

among protest groups, have hampered the planning of these intra

groups for the political conventions; however, whether this

will seriously hamper the activities cannot yet be determined.

Attached is a copy of the latest IEC report dated

6-9-72, regarding potential disruptions at the Democratic

National Convention scheduled for July 10-13, 1972, in

Miami Beach, Florida.

This report states that the Miami

Conventions coalition has been formea to organize protest

activities for both national conventions in Miami Beach this

summer. Although this group's plans call for low key demon-

strations, several groups, including the Youth International

Party, Anti-War Union and Vietnam Veterans Against the War,

intend to protest more militantly at the Democratic National

Convention. All groups will apparently focus their protest

activities on the Republican National Convention later in

August.

The report points out that protest organizations,

as well as local officials, have expressed concern regarding

opposition to protest demonstrations by various Cuban exile

groups in the Miami, area. An antiprotest movement, known as

planning is continuing, and command centers have been estab-

lished in the Miami Beach area. Law enforcement assignments

have been made, and training programs are underway in prepa-

ration for any emergency during the conventions.

The report

concludes that the number of participants currently expected

in protest activities at the Democratic National Convention

is small, and the potential for disruption is considered low

even though volatile Cuban refugees present a definite

potential for violence.

The IEC report contains information compiled from

contributions from the various Government agencies, including

STAFF SUPPORT -- INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

During May, 1971, former Attorney General Mitchell requested

that Bureau assign two qualified Agents and one secretary to permanent

working staff of Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC). This

Committee is composed of representatives of Justice, Bureau, Central

Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Secret Service, Defense '

Department and Treasury Department and it prepares reports and

estimates, primarily regarding possible civil disorders for the

White House and the Attorney General.

In response to Attornev General Mitchell's request, two Agents

were assigned full time to IEC in May, 1971 (Section Chief R. D. Cotter

and Supervisor G. T. Tunstall). Cotter has recently been appointed to

the newly created post of Bureau's Document Classification Officer to

carry out implementation of the new classification and declassification

procedures. It is believed SA Tunstall can at this time handle the Bureau's

representation to IEC alone; however, we should advise the Attorney

• General of our recall of one representative from IEC.

ACTION:

Attached for approval is appropriate letter to Attorney General

in this connection.

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

The report concludes that the number of protesters

will fall far short of the number predicted earlier by

protest leaders.

Massive civil disobedience and disruptions

are not expected at the Democratic National Convention.

Some potential for violence does exist in view of the presence

of violence-prone protesters and local antagonism against the

protesters by both senior citizens and Cuban exile groups.

Attached is a copy of the latest IEC report

dated 6/30/72 regarding potential disruptions at the

Republican National Convention scheduled for 8/21-24/72 in

The attached report concludes that while protest

leaders have predicted vast numbers of protesters, it is

hard to conceive that more than 10,000 could be assembled

for the Republican National Convention. Without support of

civil rights groups, protesters will have extreme difficulty

obtaining sufficient persons to cause serious disruptions.

Rumors of counterdemonstrations by groups opposing protesters

and the presence of violence-prone leaders, however, precludes

a prediction of little potential for violence

at the

National Convention scheduled for August 21-24, 1972, in y

Miami Beach, Florida. This report predicts that the lack of

success of protest activities during the Democratic National

Convention will affect such activities during the Republicar

National Convention. The number of participants are expected

to be greater and the violence potential higher due to oppo-

sition to current vietnam policies and to the general anti-

establishment sentiment among the protesters.

The two coalitions in operation just prior to the

Democratic National Convention, the Joint People's Action

Coalition and the Miami Conventions Coalition, are expected

to continue coordination of protest activities for the

Republican National Convention. The Vietnam Veterans Against

the War, Youth International Party, and Students for a

Democratic Society will apparently form the bulk of protesters

prone to disruptions and civil disobedience.

The Peoples Coalition for

President Nixon. The report indicates that the Youth

program includes disruptive actions. The Vietnam Veterans

Against the war is organizing caravans to travel to the

Republican National Convention to participate in protest

activities.

The report concludes that while protest yo

leaders predict up to 100,000 protesters, it is highly unlikely

that as many as 10,000 individuals can be assembled for pro-

test activities.

The potential for violence; however, is

rated higher than during the Democratic National Convention

due mainly to the inherent antagonism between the protesters

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

IFC, formed in late 1970 at the specific instructions

of President Nixon, is composed of representatives of the

various U. S. intelligence agencies.

The Committee, although

housed in the Department of Justice space under the direction

of an executive director who is a special assistant to the

Attorney General, is directly responsible to The White House.

Its purpose is to review and evaluate all data collected by

the U. S. intelligence community and to submit_results of such

evaluations to The White House.

Participating

agencies,

including the Bureau, are represented on the

working staff.

On March 21, 1972, the President's Foreign Intelligence

AdvisOrY Board (FIAB), in furtherance of the President's

announced reorganization of U. S. intelligence efforts requested

IEC to obtain from the various agencies and furnish to FIAB an

overall list of the intelligence requirements of the U. S.

intelligence community which could be collected domestically.

FIAB requested such list in connection with their study of

ways

and means to improve the quality of intelligence within

the limitations of recent budgetary and other resource con-

straints imposed upon the overallu. 'S. intelligence effort.

Wist of intellen ones made, concenensave

by the IEC_staff

they activities. dapabilities/m fetary prowese an ourenghtst whe

such a definition: in today's environment is much

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

(IEC)

This report, which will be disseminated only to The

White House with copies to the IEC member agencies, contains

observations which coincide with the already formulated

attitude of the FIAB which is interested in and nurturing

broader across-the-board intelligence collection efforts.

The

thrust being put forth is human

collection versus mechanical

collection.

In other words it is being realized that the

U. S. has been putting too many eggs in one basket at the

expense of what is thought to be by many in the intelligence

community a better and more economical means of intelligence

collection. The President in his plans for reorganization of

intelligence efforts does not desire a cut in intelligence

gathering but rather the replacement of costly collection

methods with more economical and thorough means.

If this theory is sustained and the President

endorses it, the FBI will be the logical agency to handle the

job because of our present responsibility of intelligence

collecting within the United States.

If this occurs ana

since our duties would be substantially broadened, additional

manpower and resources will be needed.

ACTION:

If approved, the bureau's representative on the IFC

staff will concur with these requirements for submission to

the FIAB.

Attached memorandum from Mr. B.A. Wells, Executive

Director of captioned Committee, indicates that The White House

through Mr. Ehrlichman's office has requested IEC prepare a

paper concerning the potential for violence in major U.S. cities

this summer.

Mr. Wells further states that this paper will

include a list of cities where such potential is greatest and

will contain an assessment of the influence of welfare cutbacks

on the potential for violence.

It will be recalled that in 6/71 THr. at the specific

request of the White House prepared a comprehensive report on

the potential for racial violence in the major U.S. cities

during the Summer of 1971. As a result of this report and an

update in 8/71, IEC was advised by The White House of the useful-

ness of these reports which were the basis for Presidential action

lessening

the possibility of violence in the concerned areas.

Although information was received from the Departments of

Housing and Urban Development, Health, Education and Welfare,

Treasury, and the Community Relations Division of the Department

of Justice, the majority of the data used was furnished by the

FBI.

In connectionwith the current request, it is pointed

out that Mr. Wells was informed by Mr. A. William Olson, Assistant

Attorney General, Internal Security Division, that the Attorney

Generat had

requested his Division along with others to furnish

by Monday March 19 all

available data regarding potential or

''''

violence this summer:

Mr. Olson inquired as to whether IEC had

been asked to submit such data.

INTERNAT SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS:

The White House requested IEC prepare an evaluation

of the potential of foreign students (Arab, Israeli and Irish)

in the U.S. for conducting or aiding terrorist activities in

this country. Prior memorandum of 11/10/72 attached a copy

of a summary of information compiled by the Bureau for use

in the above evaluation. This data was approved by the Actina

Director on 12/5/72.

Attached is the Bureau's COpy Of IEC Estimate Number 30

entitled "Foreign Students Darrorists" date #'2/73. Ihis ••

estimate concludes that the large number of Arab students in

this country present a definite potential for either aiding

Fedayeen terrorist groups in local operations or actually

participating in terrorist activities. Control of Organization

of Arab Students by militant Arabs increases the potential

for the use of this organization by terrorists. It is felt

that diplomatic missions, which have been a channel for arms

and financial support for terrorists in other countries,

could provide the means for such activities in this country.

This estimate further comments that as tensions

increase between Arabs and the Israelis and as Arab terrorist

activities increase worldwide, it becomes more possible that

Arab

students in this

country will engage or assist inauck:"

activities.

Although

Reference prior memorandum of 3/19/73 which indicated

that The White House had requested IEC prepare an estimate of

the potential for violence in major U.S. cities during the

coming summer.

Attached is the Bureau's copy of E-7 Number 2 dated'

4/6/73 captioned "Potential For Violence In The Major Cities

During Summer 1973."

This estimate combines significant data

rereived by the Committes from the bureau and the community

Relations Services of the Department of Justice.

The report indicates that the highest potential

for racial or other violence during the coming summer exists

in Washington, D. C., Newark, New Jersey, and New York City in

the East; Jackson, Mississippi, and Lumberton, North Carolina,

in the South; Chicago, Illinois, Gary, Indiana, Detroit,

Michigan, and the Indian reservations and nearby cities in

Colorado, in the West.

The report states that the chief causes l asiat

tension in the above areas are the recurring.problems.of.high

"unemployment, particularly among minority groups: inadequate

"housing, shortage of recreational facities and friction caused

by school integration policies. The phaseout and/or cutbacks

in Federal funding of antipoverty and other programs will

aggravate the underlying racial unrest. The report goes on to

state that the racial situation in ghetto areas is such that

widespread violence may erupt without prior warning.

SUBJECT:

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

"New York Times""' today carries lead story captioned

White House Ring Reportedly Spied on Radicals in 170."

This article, written by Seymour Hersh, deals chiefly with

history and activities of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee

(IEC), an interagency group which was formed at the direction

of the White House in late 1970 and which has been furnishing

general intelligence reports to the White House since that date.

The Committee is made up of representatives of the FBI, Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Department

of Defense, Secret Service, Treasury Department and Justice Department.

While the "Times" article contains elements of fact, it presents

a badly distorted version of the objectives and operations of the IEC.

This memorandum summarizes the "Times" allegations and sets

out the actual facts for the information of the Acting Director.

"New York Times" Charges

According to Hersh article, unidentified sources have reported

that the IEC was established by the White House in 1970 to collect

and evaluate information about radical and antiwar groups. The

article claims that the IEC is operated "clandestinely" out of the

Justice Department and has reported directly to John Dean, former

White House Counsel, and John Caulfield, the former White House

staff member who allegedly was involved in White House efforts to cover

up the Watergate affair. Reportedly, the IEC was created on orders

sof John Ehrlichman and Egil-Krogk; Jra an aide to Ehrlichman, has 02 4d

been connected with IEC at various times,

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

intelligence operation was needed during the national political

conventions last summer. Supposedly, government investigators

are now seeking to determine whether some of IEC's classified

reports may have been used by Justice Department agencies and

the White House to justify "undercover and double-agent activities"

against groups opposed to the Nixon Administration, including the

Democrats.

The "Times" article referred to testimony by James McCord

• to the effect that officials of the Internal Security Division of Justice

Department had supplied the Committee for the Reelection of

the President with intelligence reports on radical activities for

possible political use. McCord claimed to have visited the "analysis

and evaluation section"' of Internal Security Division to receive

some material. In reply to a question, McCord expressed the

beliet that he had obtained this information from the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee.

The "Times" has identified Bernard Wells, a former FBI Agent,

as head of IEC and claims that IEC members include officials of

FBI, CIA, NSA and "various other police and official units. " IEC

was reportedly set up to meet the grave threat posed by radical and

antiwar groups. The article notes that in response to this threat

the FBI and Justice Department had developed an'elaborate system

of undercover agents, " although it did not specifically charge that

IEC had engaged in this activity.

Facts Concerning IEC

Our files disclose the following information concerning

formation and activities of IEC, On U/25/70, Assistant Attorney.

General Robert Mardian of the Internal Security Division, personally

visited the Director. Mardian advised that he had been commissiöned

by President Nixon to establish an inter-departmental intelligence

unit for the purpose of pooling intelligence information from various

agencies concerning violent demonstrations or other efforts to overthrow

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Presidential Assistant Ehrlichman and that it would operate

from the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House.

He said the Committee would be headed by Morell Sharp, former

judge from the State of Washington, and he expressed the hope

that all member agencies, including the FBI, would appoint top.

men to represent them in the group. Mr. Hoover assured

Mardian of the FBI's co-operation in this endeavor. On 12/1/70,

Section Chief G. C. Moore of the Domestic Intelligence Division,

was named as the FBI's representative. In December, 1970, and

during the early months of 1971, several meetings of the group

were held in the office of John Dean. They were attended by

representatives of Justice, CIA, FBI, NSA, Secret Service,

Defense Department, Treasury Department, Mr. Dean, Mr. Krogh,

,Mr. Mardian and Judge Sharp. At the initial meeting, the group

adopted the name inteligence Evaluation Committee and Mardian

explained that the group had been assigned the mission of pooling

information regarding political terrorism in the U.S. According

to Mardian, the Committee would report to Ehrlichman and H. R.

Haldeman at the White House as well as Attorney General Mitchell

and they, in turn, would advise the President so that he could weigh

what federal action was necessary. During one meeting Krogh

cautioned those present that the White House wanted to make

certain there were no leaks to the press regarding the IEC.

As a matter of fact, during late January, 1971, it was announced

that Judge Sharp was dropping out as head of IEC in view of the fact

that his presence in the Executive Office Building had caused several

inquiries by newspaper men. At the same time it was decided to

move: the.headquarters.of.IEC from the. Executive Office Building

....

to space in the internal Security Division of the Department and to

place the Committee under the direction of a departmental official 199

John Doherty.

One of the early problems facing the IEC was the question

of staffing. Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mardian

to provide staff support but on 5/17/71, Attorney General Mitchell

personally requested that the FBI provide two Agents and one secretary

3

H# 55021 DocId:32989607 Page 261

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

for the permanent working staff of IEC. Mr. Hoover acceded

to this request and two Domestic Intelligence Division Supervisors

(R. D. Cotter and G. T. Tunstall) were designated along with

a secretary. FBI staff support for the IEC has continued to the

present time except beginning in July, 1972, only one Agent Supervisor

has been assigned to the Committee.

Other agencies have also supplied staff support for IEC. For

example, for the first year and a half Department of Defense

furnished a professional analyst and during the summer of 1971,

NSA provided a security specialist on a full-time basis. All member

agencies have designated representatives who attend the regular

weekly staff meetings of IEC and who furnish assistance on a part-time

basis.

Organization and Activities of IEC

IEC is headed by an Executive Director, former FBI Agent Wells, and

a Deputy, another former FBI Agent (James McGrath). The IEC has two

full-time secretaries including one from the FBI. During roughly the

first six months of IEC's existence, its efforts were devoted primarily

to preparing periodic intelligence estimates with reference to antiwar

activities, especially the May, 1971, activities at Washington, D.C.

Thereafter, the IEC has given its attention to and prepared reports

concerning a variety of domestic intelligence matters of likely interest

to the President, most of them revolving around possible civil disorders.

For instance, the IEC has prepared several reports dealing with the

potential of racial violence, another dealing with prison riots and

throughout the spring and summer of 1972, the Committee prepared

a series of intelligence summaries dealing with the potential for

..:violence at the two major political conventions held in Miami Beach: ..

SeS

Normally, requests for such estimates have originated with

Dean although there have been a few exceptions to this, such as regard

to reports dealing with terrorist activities recently prepared by IEC

at the request of the President's Cabinet Committee on Terrorism.

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

To our knowledge, James McCord has never had any

connection with the IEC. It appears that McCord's reference

to the "analysis and evaluation section" may have denoted a

unit which did exist in the Internal Security Division of the

Department, namely the Analysis and Evaluation Unit, which was

under Mardian's direction.

At no time has the IC engaged in any activities of an

operational nature or made any recommendations for operational

activities. It has concerned itself entirely with preparing summary-

type estimates based on the information contributed by member

agencies. While its reports have been classified, they have generally

speaking not involved particularly sensitive information and they

have all related to subversive or criminal activities of one type

or another of likely interest to the White House. It is hard to visualize

how any political use could have been made of any IEC's reports.

In any case, FBI representatives on the IEC have no knowledge

whatever of any political ramifications in the activities of this group.

One particular project undertaken by the IEC should be mentioned.

During July, 1971, Assistant Attorney General Mardian called a

meeting of the IEC and explained that he had just returned from

seeing the President in San Clemente, and that as a result of his

visit with Mr. Nixon, he was charging the IEC with the preparation

of a comprehensive report regarding the handling of classified and

sensitive information. Mardian noted this study had been prompted

by the Ellsberg case but said that the IEC would in no way concern itself

with the Ellsberg matter from an investigative or prosecutive stand-

106001941

point. Mardian said the President wanted the "IEC' tö condüct an ".

N9h943.242

overal review of all factors relating to classification and protection.s.&.ve

i"..

of national defense information and to make appropriate recommendations

for Mr. Nixon's consideration.

Shortly thereafter, during the last week of July, 1971, IEC's

Executive Director Doherty reported to the IC staff that a White

we House staff member had been appointed to.work:with IC in conducting...h

its inquiries with regard to the handling of classified information..

The latter was identified as Gordon Liddy, who has recently received

¿considerable notoriety in connection with the Ellsberg case.

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Liddy did meet on one occasion with the IEC staff in

August, 1971, at which time he discussed the project in very

general terms. This was the only contact Liddy had with the

IEC, either personally or in writing, to the knowledge of the

FBI representatives. The IEC published a special report in

November, 1971, entitled "The Unauthorized Disclosure of

Classified Information" which completed this particular

assignment. This study alluded to the Ellsberg situation, but

only as a case in point. It dealt primarily with existing federal

procedures for the handling of classified data and set out nine

specified recommendations to tighten these procedures.

intolligence operation was needed during the national political

conventions last summer. Supposedly, government investigators

are now seeking to determine whether some of IEC's classified

reports may have been used by Justice Department agencies and

the White House to justily "undercover and double-ageut activities"

against groups opposed to the Nixon Administration, including the

Democrats.

The "Times" article referred to testimony by James McCord

to the effect that officials of the internal Security Division of Justice

Department had supplied the Committee for the Reelection of

the President with intelligence reports on radical activities for

possible political use. McCord claimed to have visited the "analysis

and evaluation section" of Internal Security Division to receive

some material.

In reply in a question, McCord expressed the

belief that he had obtained this information from the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee.

The "Times" has identified Bernard Wells, a former FBI Agent,

as head of IEC and claims that InC members include citicials ot

FBI, CIA, NSA and "various other police and aficial units." IC

was roportedly set up to meet the grave threat posed by radical and

antiwar groups. The article notes that in response to this threat

the FBI and Justice Department had developed an'elaborate system

of undercover agents," although it did not specifically charge that

INC had engaged in this activity.

He said the Committee would be headed by Morell Sharp, former

judge from the State of Washington, and he expressed the hope

that all member agencies, including the fat, would appoint top

men to represent them in the gresp. Mr. Hoover assured

Mardian of the FBI'& co-operation in this endeavor. On 12/1/10,

Section Chief G. C. Moore of the Domestic Intelligence Division,

was named as the T'BI's representative. In December, 1970, und

during the early months of 1971, several meetings of the group

were held in the office o. John Dean. They were attended by

representatives of Justice, Cing FBi, NSA, Secret service,

Defense Department, Treasury Department, Mr. Deas, Mr. Krogh,

Mr. Mardian and Judgo Shuap. At the initial mecting, the group

arlopted the name Intelligence [valuation Commitos and Marciau

explained that the group had been assigned the miscion of pooling

information regarding political terrorism in the U. 6. According

to Mardian, the Commitee would report to Shrlichman and H. R.

Haldeman at the White House as well as Attorney General Mitchell

and they, in turn, would advise the President so that he could weigh

what federal action was necessary.

During one meeting Isrogh

cautioned those present that the White House wanted to make

certain there were no leaks to the press regarding the IBC.

As a mattor of fact, during late Jaruary, 19%1, it was announced

that Judge Sharp was dropping out as head of IEC is view of the fact

thạt his presence in the Exocutive Office Building had caused several

inquiries by newspaper men. At the same time it was decided to

place toe Committee under the direction of a departmental official,

John Doherty.

One of the early problems facing the IEC was the question

at staffing.

Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mardian

to provide staff support but on 5/17/71, Attorney General Mitchell:

personally requested that the FBI provide two Agents and one secretary

to this request and two Domestic Intelligence Division Supervisors

(R. D. Cotter and G, T. Tunstall) were designated along with

a secretary. FBI stait support for the IC has continod to the

present time except beginning in July, 19%2, only one Agent Supervisor

Other agencies have also supplied stail support for IBC.

FOr

Organization and Activities o ISC

IEC la headed by ay Executive Director, former FBI Agent Welle, and

a Deputy, another former F'BI Agent (James McGrathy, The IC has two

full time secretaries including one from the FBI. During roughly the

firat six nonths o IC's existence, its eiforte were devoted primarily

to preparing periodic intelligence estimates with reierence to antiwar

activities, especially the May, 1971, activities at Washington, D.C.

Thereafter, the IDC has given its attention to and prepared reports

concerning a variety of domestic intelligence matters of libely interest

to the President, most of them revolving around possible civil disorders.

for instance, the IEC has propared several reports dealing with the

politial of racial violence, another dealing with prison riots and

throughout the spring and summer of 1072, the Committee prepared:

a sertes of intelligence summaries dealing with the potential for

violence at the two major political conventions held in Miami Beach

Dean although there have been a few exceptions to this, such as regard

to reports dealing with terrorist activities recently prepared by IEC

at the request of the President's Cabinet Committee on Terrorism.

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

To our knowledge, James McCord has never had any

connection with the INC. It appoars that McCord's reference

to the "analysis and evaluation section" may have denoted a

unit which did exist in the Internal Security Division of the

Department, namely the Anaiysis and Evaluation Unit, which was

úndor Mardian's direction.

At no time has the ICC engaged in any activities of an

operational sature or made any recommendations for operational

activities. It has concerned itself entirely with preparing summary

type estimates based on the information contributed by member

agencies. While ite reports have been classifted, they have gonerally

speaking not involved particularly sensitive information and they

have all related to subversive or crimial activitias of one type

or another of Ilkely interest to the White House. It is hard to visualize

how any political use could have been made of any IC's raports.

in any case, FBI reprosentatives on the IDC have to knowledge

whatever of any political rambications in the activities of this group.

One particular project undertaken by the IC should ba mentioned.

During July, 1971, Assistant Attorney General Mardian called a

meeting of the INC and explained that he had just retumed from

seeing the President in San Clemente, and that as a result of his

visit with Mr. Nixon, he was charging the ISC with tho preparation

of a comprehensive report regarding the handling of classified and

sensitive information. Mardian noted this study had been prompted

by the Ellsberg case but said that the IC would in no way concorn itsel

with the Ellsborg mader from an investigative or prosecutive stand-

point.

Mardian said the

President wanted the Lic to conduct ar

overall revlew or ali factors relating to classification and protection

of national defense information and to make appropriate recommendations

for Mr. Nixoz's consideration.

Shortly thereafter, during the last week of July, 1971, ICC's

Executive Director Doherty reported to the ICC staff that a White

House staff member had been appointed to work with EC in conducting

its Inquiries withregard to the handling of classified information.

The latter was identified as Gortion Liddy, who has recently recelved

considerable notoriety in connection with the Ellsberg case.

The IEC published a special report in

November, 1971, entitled "The Unauthorized Disclosure of

SUBJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

An article in today's "Evening Star and Daily News"

under the heading "Senators Seeking Radical Ties Data"

reports information from the Associated Press regarding the

alleged connections of the IEC with political espionage-type

activities. The article presents a totally misleading picture

of the IEC.

Specifically, the "Star" piece claims that unidentified

sources close to the Watergate investigation have reported that the

IEC was established in December, 1970, after FBI Director Hoover

had objected to a Ton Secret White House plan devised tn imprnve

U. S. intelligence operations. Reportedly, the IEC was established

ostensibly to improve co-ordination among U. S. intelligence agencies

and prepare estimates of domestic intelligence, however, it soon

became "a cover for a secret police operation." The article further

charged that the IEC had used its access to government agencies to

intercept mail, tap telephones, review income tax returns and plant

informers. One source was quoted "They (the IEC) were using

the national-security plan that Hoover objected to. That was the

blue print. "

A United Pres International story released early today cites

similar allegations carried by the New York "Daily News." In addition,

this story charges that a break-in at the Chilean Embassy in May, 1972,

was part of the plan for domestic espionage (apparently referring to

the plan devised by an interdepartmental ad hoc intelligence committee

These news stories are way off base. As reported in my prior

for operational activity. It has had no connection whatever with any

rtype of espionage activities or.with the maikinterception, wire tapping, "."

informant activities or the monitoring of income tax returns.

It is entirely separate and distinct from the temporary interdepartmental

committee on intelligence (Ad Hoc) which prepared an extensive

réport on internal security matters in June, 1970.

The burglary at the Chilean Embassy in May, 1972, had

no connection with any government operations, clandestine

or otherwise, so far as we know. This burglary was reported

to the Metropolitan Police Department which conducted an inquiry

showing that four or five radios and one electric razor were stolen.

No national security angles developed and no FBI investigation was

ever conducted.

SUBJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

DATE: 6/4/73

The Seattle Office has submitted an airtel

enclosing a letterhead memorandum, both dated 5/30/73 and

attached, setting forth some "concerns" from U. S. District Judge

Morxell E. Sharp, Western District of Washington, Seattle, as

expressed

with regard to the captioned Committee, which is now

receiving a substantial amount of publicity in the press.

Judge Sharp is a former Supreme Court Justice of the

State of Washington who originally was to have headed the IC as

its operating chairman and did: in fact,

attend several of the

early meetings. I attended the meetings of this Committee as the

Bureau's representative.

In the incoming letterhead memorandum Judge Sharp,"'

among

other things, related that "while the initial purposes of the group

appear to be quite legitimate there was some discussion about some

clandestine operations that may be engaged in and at this point it

became evident to him that he did not want to have any part of it

and furthermore he did not want to operate in Washington without

his real purpose being known to his contacts in the State of

Washington, namely Senator Jackson and Senator Magnuson."

Although Judge Sharp might have been aware of some

"clandestine" operations discussed in his presence by Mr. Robert.

Mardian of the Department of Justice (prime mover in establishing

the tEC) or on the part of others that i was not a party to, la

would be as well as the overall purpose of the Committee. (I might

add that very few present seemed to have any conception either as

to what form the Committee should take, including Mardian, who

evidently had been given the assignment to establish a committee

which would coordinate intelligence and furnish evaluations to the

President.)

A considerable amount of concern was voiced by both

Mardian and John W. Dean III (who represented The White House) at

these early meetings as to the necessity for keeping the functions

of this unit away from the press and prevent The White House From

being identified with the group. Judge Sharp was cautioned during

each meeting very carefully in this regard as to how to handle

this matter in the event of a press inquiry.

In this regard there is attached one copy each of

memoranda dated 12/3//U and 12/16/70 which set out details relative

to White House concern as to the necessity for providing a

security cover for the IFC. You will note that Page 2 of the

12/3/70 memorandum shows that Mardian was instructed by the

Attorney General to have Judge Sharp's salary paid by the Justice

Department and the Committee would be considered to be operating

under the Justice Department's auspices and arrangements were being

made for space in Federal Office Building Number Seven near The

White House. It was also indicated that original thinking was to

have the Committee go by the name of "The White House Intelligence

Evaluation Committee" but because of possible publicity it was

decided by the Attorney General not to have The White House in the

title but have the Committee operate under some insignificant name

such as the "Intelligence Evaluation Committee." The purpose of

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

the Committee was operating under the Justice Department in

connection with the operation of the Interdivision Information

Unit (IDIU). Mr. Mardian stated, in fact, that the IC had nothing

whatever to do with the IDIU but

the response would be for security

cover purposes only.

Our files show Judge Sharp attended three meetings of

the IEC all during the initial stages of its development -- first

on 12/3/70 followed by meetings on 12/16/70 and 1/11/71. He did

not attend the fourth scheduled meeting on 1/25/71. At that

meeting Mr. Mardian explained the absence of Judge Sharp by stating

there had been several inquiries made by acquaintances of Judge

Sharp in Congress which caused the Attorney General and White House

concern that it would be difficult to maintain appropriate security

concerning the Committee's work with Judge Sharp as its head and

in an office located so near The White House (Federal Office Building

Number seven). Mardian scaled thai accuringly, ai a meeting held

1/21/71 at The White House, attended by Mardian, John W. Dean III,

the Attorney General, H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, it was

decided to have the Committee function in space occupied by the

Internal Security Division of the Department, 315 Ninth Street,

Northwest, and that Judge Sharp should be removed from the Committee

and assigned to other consultant duties with the Justice Department.

A copy of the 1/26/71 memorandum is also attached.

In addition to the above, it is my own personal recollection

that Judge Sharp was very much concerned about the nature of his

assignment in that he frequently made trips to the State of

Washington and friends would ask him what type of work he was doing.

DECLASSIFICATION MATTER

On 2/19/74, Mr. Kevin Maroney, Deputy Assistant Attorney

General of the Criminal Division, contacted me and inquired whether

two prior FBI letters to the Department can now be declassified. The

items in question are our letters to the Internal Security Division dated

1/27/71 and 2/3/71 both entitled Intelligence Evaluation Committee,

Internal Security - Miscellaneous. " These letters both deal With the

issue of whether or not the FBI would provide personnel to staff the

Committee. They were classified on the grounds that disclosure of the

existence of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee could damage

national defense.

At the time these communications were prepared (1971) the White

House had indicated a desire to keep the existence of the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee secret. However, during the past year there has

been considerable publicity revealing not only the existence of IEC but

details of those operations. Hence, there is no longer any grounds for

retaining the classification of these communications. I advised Mr. Maroney

that both letters could be declassified and appropriate steps have been

taken to so mark them.

- Maroney desired declassification of these items in connection with

certain Departmental communications he is furnishing to the Senate

"REQUEST OF GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE

ON BEHALF OF CONGRESSMAN ROYBAL

By letter 7/18/74, Mr. Daniel E Stanton, Assistant Director,

General-Accounting Office (GAO), has advised that GAO is conducting

inquiry regarding former Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC) on

behalt of Congressman Edward f Koybal. Stanton specitically has

requested the following data (!) names of the FBI personnel, including

secretaries, who participated in activities of IEC either as members of.

Committee or working staff and periods they served; (2) estimate of

funds expended by FBI in support of IEC and the appropriations from

which such payments were madc.

Based on request of former Assistant Attorney General Mardian

we designated a Special Agent to represent Bureau on IEC on inception

of this group in December, 1970, until it was dissolved in June, 1973.

Other agencies represented on IEC included Justice Department, Central

Intelligence Agency, Defense Department, Secret Service, Treasury

, Department and National Security Agency. With regard to members of the

working staff, Mr. Hoover initially resisted a request by Mardian for

us to supply FBI personnel for this purpose. However, in May, 1971,

former Attorney General Mitchell requested in writing that we furnish

two Agents and a secretary as members of the IEC working staff.

Accordingly, beginning 6/1/71, we did staff the IEC working group. Two

SAs were named full time to this assignment initially, however, beginning

6/1/72 this was reduced to one Agent. One secretary was assigned to

the IEC working group continuously from 6/1/71 - 6/11/73 when IEC was

disbänded.

Based on estimate prepared by the Administrative Division:

approximately $116, 900 was required to cover FBI salary costs. No

special appropriation was sought to cover this amount and it was handred

Reference is made to memorandum from A. B. Fulton to me, 7/26/74,

in captioned matter. You requested a memorandum be prepared outlining the

background and activities of the IC.

On 11/25/70 Assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian of the Internal

Security Division contacted Director J. Edgar Hoover. He advised that he had

(been commissioned by President Nixon to establish an Interdepartmental

Intelligence Unit for the purpose of pooling intelligence information from various

agencies regarding violent demonstrations or other efforts to overthrow the

Government. Mardian said the group had the support of Presidential Assistant

Ehrlichman,

that it would operate from the Executive Office Building; and

would be headed by Morell/Sharp, a former judge, Mr. Hoover assured Mardian

of the FBI's cooperation and on 12/1/70 Section Chief G. C. Moore of the

Intelligence Division was named as the FBI representative.

In December, 1970, and during the early months of 1971, several

meetings of the group were held in the office of John Dean. They were attended

by representatives of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, National

Security Agency (NSA), Secret Service, Defense Department, Treasury

Department, Mr. Dean, Mr. Egil Krogh, Mr. Mardian, and Judge Sharp. At

the initial meeting, the group adopted the name "Intelligence Evaluation

Committee" and Mardian explained that it had been assigned the primary mission

of pooling information concerning political terrorism in the U. S. According to

Mardian, the Committee would report to Ehrlichman and H. R. Haldeman at

The White House as well as Attorney General Mitchell; and they, in turn, would

advise the President so that he could weigh what action was necessary. During

one meeting Krogh cautioned that The White House wanted no leaks to the press

regarding the IC.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IC)

Request of General Accounting Office on

Behalf of Congressman Roybal

In late January, 1971, it was announced that Sharp was dropping out as

head of IEC since his presence in the Executive Office Building had prompted press

inquiries. At the same time, it was decided to move IEC from the Executive Office

Building to the Internal Security Division of the Department and to place it under

the direction of a Departmental official, John Doherty.

One of the early problems facing the IC was the question of staffing.

Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mardian to provide staff support.

However, on 5/17/71 Attorney General Mitchell requested in writing that the Bureau

provide two agents and one secretary for the lee working statt. Mr. Hoover

acceded to this request and two Intelligence Division supervisors (R. D. Cotter and

G. T. Tunstall) were designated with a secretary. FBI staff support continued

until dissolution of IEC on 6/11/73 (although beginning in July, 1972, one Agent was

recalled).

Other agencies also supplied limited support for IC. During the first

year and one-half, the Defense Department provided a professional analyst and

during Summer of 1971 NSA furnished a full-time security specialist. Other agencies

also designated representatives who attended weekly staff meetings and furnished

assistance on a part-time basis.

Following retirement of Doherty in September, 1971, IEC was headed by

a tormer FBI Agent, Bernard F. Wells, with another ex-Agent, James McGraph,

(serving as his deputy.

During the first part of 1971, IC efforts were devoted primarily to

preparing periodic intelligence estimates on antiwar activities and demonstrations

and during 1972 a large part of the IEC's efforts was directed to preparing summaries

of possible demonstrations at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

IC was preparing a variety of other reports of possible interest to the

Howexert, no yed pren is variety at obes reports d possible interest to the wea

included reports dealing with the potential. of racial violence and another dealing..

with prison disturbances.

One project undertaken by IEC deserves special mention. During July, 1971,

Mardian called a special meeting of IEC and explained he had just returned from

meeting the President in San Clemente. He said that the IC was commissioned to

/prepare'a comprehensive report concerning the handling of classified information.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re:

Request of General Accounting Office on

Behalf of Congressman Roybal

Mardian indicated this had been prompted by the Ellsberg case but said IC would

not concern itself with the Ellsberg matter from an investigative or prosecutive

I standpoint. He said the President wanted IEC to conduct an overall review of factors

relating to the protection of national defense information.

Shortly thereafter, Mr. Doherty reported that a White House Stall member,

Gordon Liddy, had been named to work with IEC in handling this project. Liddy

met on one occasion, in August, 1971, with the IC staff, and discussed the project

in general terms. In November, 1971, IEC published a special report entitled "The

Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information, " which completed this assignment.

Normally, IC projects originated with John Dean, although there were some

exceptions such as a report on terrorist activities requested by the President's

Cabinet Committee on Terrorism. IC estimates were furnished to Dean and the

heads of each member agency, inciucing the Attorney Generai.

There has been some speculation that the IEC was actually an outgrowth of

the so-called "Huston Plan" which had been briefly approved by President Nixon in

Ithe Summer of 1970. This plan called for the lifting of various investigative

restraints on U. S. intelligence agencies (relating to covert mail coverage, wire-

taps, surreptitious entry, etc.) and also urged the formation of an interagency

intelligence group to keep The White House advised regarding matters of domestic

intelligence interest. This plan was scotched by The White House based on the

(strenuous objections of FBI Director Hoover as well as Attorney General Mitchell.

However, a memorandum prepared by John Dean in September, 1970, revived the

idea of an interagency intelligence group which would not only provide evaluations of

domestic intelligence for the President but which would also be operational in nature.

Circumstances indicate this memorandum was a forerunner to establishment of IEC.

wIt should, be stressed, however, that at no time did IC engage, in any a ma

activities of an operational nature nor did it make any recommendations for

operational activity. It concerned itself wholly with preparing summary-type

estimates based on data contributed by member agencies. FBI representatives on

the IEC have no knowledge whatever of any political ramifications in the activities

'of this group.

'ACTION: This is for your information.
