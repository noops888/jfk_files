Dear Bob,

It was very good to meet with you again in Hashington on June 12.

I an writing to contiru our recent convereation about the CIA's release

of documents about ue to the National Archives.. de I explained to you at

our meeting. I am very displeased that this was done without my knowled-

Ee and especially since my photograph wes officially released by the

Agency for the first time In thirty years.

As you know, it has oome to my attention that the CIA released these

many hundreds of pages to the public without consulting me or telling

, me that this was going to be done. I have already seen copiee of two of

these

reports totalling more than 700 pages. One 1s the October 1968

report sunporting me by Bruce Solfe; the other was a February 1968 re-

port by the CI stell which attacked my credibility. (Ihis latter report

contains a cory of my photo from the late 1960s. I consider this a breach

of my personal security.)

I also consider many of the details in both of these reports to be of a

very personal nature. Other pages deal with with some very sensitive

cases which I gave the Agency about other people. the Information In

these rerorts was given freely and accurately by me to the CIA officere

In the 1960s under, terne of strict confidentiallty. Although It 1s very

difficult for me to say this, I leel that my trust in the Agency has now

been seriously danaged.

This releze particularly troubles ue because for the past tality yeara

I have renained very loyal to the Agency and considerate of its wishes.

for instance, despite many requests, I have only spoken to a few jour

nalists, and only when the Agency advised me tollo. I have never sought
