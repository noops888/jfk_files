Bahamian Government campaigned on the promise that

if elected they would rid American gangsters from the

Commissioner MORRIS will report to the

Commission that the Bahamas Police Force has attempted

to identify the hoodlums allegedly in control of Bahamas

He will testify that he has caused the

exclusion of certain gamblers from the casinos and

has failed to accept others who have made application

for employment in the casinos due to their reported

hoodlum influence or criminal records.

There follows a Xerox copy of the articles

appearing in the "Miami News," 3/16/67, and the

"Miami Herald," 3/17/67.
