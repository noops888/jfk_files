Remarks: (Continued-)

Philadelphla, Pa.

Since date of original

purchased a publie address system which necessitated

additional wiring by the telephone company.

The Phila-

delphia Division has been told by their contact with the

telephone company that the owners of the Maggio Cheese

Company and the Milkmald Dairy Produets Company were

suspicious of any activity on the part of the telephone

men installing the above speaker system it it appeared

that these individuals were i0 a part of the company

building not directly related to the location where a

speaker

was being Installed. These businesses operate

on a 24-hour basis and entry would have to be during the

noznal daylight working hours. If the Bureau authorizes

Installation at the Maggio Cheese Company, it 1s requested

by the Philadelphia Division that a thoroughly trained

sound agent from the Laboratory on a surrounding field

division be allowed to come to Philadelphia for the

installation proper

This request 1s being made based

on the fact that the sound men assigned to Philadelphia

have either conducted interviews with persons owning or

employed by the Maggio Cheese Company or have been assigned

to the alvision for a long period of time and could possibly

be known.

It is also felt that this would be advisable due

to the suspicloue nature of the onners of the Magglo Cheese

Company.

There w1ll be facilitles to bring the microphone

survelliance from the company location for two microphones

only as the company. Is located

in a heavily conjested area.

At the desired locations for Installation of a microphone

there are facilities available which are arranged so that

thoy do not enter into any of the telephone automatie

equipment.

The only possible equipment syitable for in-

stallation in thie case would be a "mate.

If Installation is authorized, it le felt that

the person making such installation should have proper

identification fron the telephone company which can be

arranged by the Philadelphia Divisions

It 1s brought to

the Bureau's attention that SA BRUCE FISHER recently

assigned to the Laboratory, may have thie identification

aste abora orat,

at the present time.
