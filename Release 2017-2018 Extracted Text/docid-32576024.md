unidentified man not to testify to knowing MAGADDINO.

MAGADDINO

retorted that they only ask about him because of JOHNNY POPS

(JOHN PAPALIA), and about another man whom BU T-2 belleved to

be ALBERT AGUECI.

MAGADDINO then began to discourse as to how this

unidentified man could testify by claiming inability to

remember and by claiming he had met many people.

He also

suggested that the man could admit knowing MAGADDINO but

only casually and nothing of a derogatory nature.

Later when MAGADDINO commented that he was proud

of the "family" he had raised, RANDACCIO asked MAGADDINO

In a facetious manner which "family" he was talking about.

MAGADDINO expressed disapproval of RANDACCIO's comment,

whereupon RANDACCIO quickly added that MAGADDINO had done a

good job with "both families."
