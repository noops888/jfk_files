Section B as Juan do bose

This employee continues to be. Chief of the Station Registry

During the past year

his level of performance can be properly evaluated as exceptionhy prolicient. He

contimes to welcome hard work, is not bothered by constantly changing deadines

and is able to fill in for any absent member of his unit, and keep up his own work

as well. He is quite conscious of the value of Government personnel and materiel,

and does everything in his power to conserve these resources. He contines to come

up with new ideas on how to perform his functions in a more efficient and effective

manner. This results in benefits to the entire Station. It la regretable that the

posttion this employee fills does not allow for promotion since he has been performing

at a level above his present grade for several years.

When Subjoct took

tho sosponsibility for Registry a year ago, he found a

Ho asked for and was given the responsibility to analyzo and

distribute the cables,

which had previously boon a function

of the Chief of Station's secrotary.

He recommended the

discontinuance of the abstract system,

which proposal had

been

adopted by most clements of the Station.

a reduction in the retentlon poriod for cable and uispatch
