Dear Tony,

You can be of great service to me in a very desperate situation.

If Phil is available and willing (and I hope he will be), have him

contact his former employers and tell them that-I have been trying-to

get in touch with them discreetly for several weeks. A letter was even

sent to their Cuban Affairs Section in the hope it would reach the right

person, So far there has been no answer from them and time is running out

on me. 75)

Frankly, this is a matter of life or death, so do you best to have

Phil contact his former employers.

They. should make only the most dis

creet contacts with me here in New York, so that we can arrange a meeting

— I suggest Montreal because I often have had business there and it is

out of the country. I believe that I can be of extreme value to them

and I know that, if they are willing, they can be of great help to me in

a very diffücult situation. JG)

PLEASE KEEP THIS STRICTLY TO YOURSELE AND PHIL AND DO NOT MENTION

IT TO ANYONE EISE. Destroy this letter when you have read it.

Phil's former employers can contact me at this address almost any

afternoon.

You can call me collect at this nümber or at my home phone

(YU 2-6011), but watch what you say over the phone. One other thing:

I'Il be in Conway, N.H. from April 23 to 27, but I can be reached by phone

at the World Fellowship Center there Jes)

Many thanks for tour aid. Someday I'll be able to explain more about

this to you, but, again, I ask you to be absolutely secretive about this

-manneraToy dorahide depends on it!
