WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 440-C advised that RUBY STRAUSS, once connected

with the big bookmakers in the Miami area, is no longer gambling

or bookmaking. He stated STRAUSS has remarried a stable woman

and is employed by the Gulf American Land Corporation as a real

estate salesman.

MM 743-C was told that MELVIN RICHARDS, Mayor of Miami

Beach, and BERNARD FRANK, Miami Beach City Councilman, will make

a "big pitch" to establish a

separate county for Miami Beach,

with the ultimate "pitch" for legalized gambling in the proposed

new county.

MM 883-C-TE reported the local Cuban bolita operators

have come up with a new system of selecting the winning bolita

numbers on a daily basis. The new method involves the use of

the numbers of the winning dogs at the local dog tracks and thus

the bettors can verify the winning numbers by reading local

newspapers. He stated the local Latin Americans and colored

individuals are switching to this type of bolita or numbers game,

as they feel this method protects them from fixed drawings. He

pointed out that every day except Sunday, bettors can bet on the

three numbers in the hundreds, three numbers in the tens and three

parlays on all local dog races. He cited for example that in each

dog race there is a win, place and show and if #4 dog won, #1 dog:

placed and #3 dog showed, the above numbers would become the

shore, tae

numerical number 413.
