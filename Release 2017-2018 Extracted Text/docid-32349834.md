GYROSE

Theodore D. OSTIER (P) in a face to

face conversation

with Jesus FERNANDEZ,

and Orlando RODRIGUEZ Perez, the latter

is the 30 November

delegate to the CRe.

The arrangements

for the meeting

on 23 December through

the good

offices of AMSHANK 1.

The meeting was

held on

24 December

and raw information was received by WAVE Reports on 27 December.

There is no additional information on the personalities

mentioned.

The information is being forwarded because

other rumors and vague reports of the struggle between 26 July

and the Reds.

The source comments are based on the facts as

reported in the comments.

Little has been done to edit

names because this seems

to be the whole point of support

for this rumor.

WAVE Reporting may once again

the general trend, but feel that 3 is warrented though 6 is

probably the safe way out.

No dates of information

provided other than as indicated.

recently

received, so WAVE Reports has assumed mid-November.

Danilo Mesa now at Gainesville U.

Re para 3 it is assumed that the "do nothing policy" refers

to the U.S. government.

As of about mid-November there was

a rumor in Cuba to

the effect that following the departure of the soviets

from Cuba, Fidel Castro Ruz was going to do away with

Communists

and return to the platform of the

26 of July Movement.

It is also rumored that Fidel Castro is aware of the

fact

that to accomplish this tour de force without loss of his

leading position he will have to have the full support of

About July

with the same proposal as was contained intthe letter

written by Duarte.

It is not known whether there was

any concert of action between Duarte and his group and

the approach by Alamos and Toyos.

A delegate of one of the anti-Castro groups in exile

telephoned his relatives in Cuba during the

early part

of December 1962.

In talking about his brother who is

a political prisoner in El Principe, this exile determined

that his brother can again receive visitors and receive

packages.
