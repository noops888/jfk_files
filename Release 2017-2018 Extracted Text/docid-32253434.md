This will respond to the June 2, 1977, letter to the

Director of the FBI from Congressman Louis Stokes, Chairman,

ASCA, requesting FBI Identification Records of the four above-

referenced names.

Subsequent to delivery of the June 2nd letter, an

HSCA representative furnished the dates and places of birth

(1) Loran Eugene Hall - DPOB: January 4, 1930,

Newton, Kansas.

(2) Lawrence Howard - DPOB: January 17, 1935;

Los Angeles, California.

Fort Benton, Montana.

Jerald, Gerald or Gerould.

Searches to locate pertinent Identification Records

were based on the limited information furnished by HSCA and

since fingerprints did not accompany the request, the FBI can-

not guarantee that the following material concerns the

individuals that HSCA is interested in. Identification Records

were located and

copies are attached as enclosures one through

four as follows:
