MM T-1 said that at that time, Interpen

consisted of about fourteen members, most of whom

were staying at 1925 Southwest 4th Street, the

Prato said that Perez Jimenez wondered how it was

lemming had another plan to obtain a 106 foot

salvage boat to take his group on a commando raid against

Cuba.

dowever, he was mable to obtain access to this

boat.

MM Tol explained that Hemming has a new and different

plan

dally, does not follow through on any of them, and

none of them ever succeed. (X)

Press Publicity

The "Miami Herald," a dally newspaper published

in Miami, Florida, on June 27, 1961, contained an article

concerning Interpen, stating that most members are Americans,

although the leaders claim the group includes Canadians,

Venezuelans, Cubans and other anti-Commists. The

article stated that the existence of this group was known

by the Herald, but it became generally known to the

public on June 26, 1961, after Florida Senator George

A. Smathers disclosed that Cuban exiles are training in

Florida. The article said that Senator Smathers! dis-

closure on a nation-wide radio network brought other

newsmen and television cameramen to Interpen headquarters

on June 26, 1961.

The article described Herming as a "young

giant, 6 feet 7 inches tall, with long wavy hair, a

trinned beard, an Australian bush hat,

who looks

like Errol Flynn in his earlier matinee days."

The

article stated that Hemming said the recruits are

first housed at the headquarters, and then sent to

a training site in the Everglades, accessible only

by boat.

The article continued, stating that Interpen

holds parachute rigging classes in the middle of a

street in Miami, and one elderly Miani couple stated

Re: Intercontinental Penetration Forces

they told the police, but the police said there was

nothing they could do about it.. The article said

that the climan of Interpen training is parachute

jumping at an abandoned South Florida airfield.

The article continued that Heming hires

a sky diving instructor and rents a light plane for

the exercises, and during the jumping drills on the

previous Saturday, the Sheriff's patrol officers

looked on and made no attempt to interfere. The

article went on that Interpen has about one hundred

members, including

some at bases in California and

in the North, and its purpose was to fight Coumnism,

look for adventure, or "because they just like soldier

ing."

Joe Gorman,

a member from Kentucky, was quoted

as saying:

"I would rather be

shot to death than

bored to death."

EMM To1, on June 27, 1961 fadvised that

the above-mentioned article was out of proportion

to the true situation, and served no other purpose

than to obtain publicity for Hemming and attract

more adventurers to the Miami area.

MM T-1 explained that on June 27, 1961,

a plane was rented at Howe Aviation, Tamiami Airport,

Miami, and flown to an abandoned field at Davie,

Florida, where the plane was met by Hemming, Joe,

"Gorman, Larry Worley, Frank Little and one other

Re:

Joe Gorman and Larry Worley got in the airplane,

and each made a parachute jump. When these, two only

available parachutes were repacked, Frank Little and

Hemming boarded the airplane and made a parachute jum.

The photographer took photographs, which appeared in a

later issue of the "Miami Herald." a

MM Tol said that these were the first and

only parachute jumps made by Interpen members:

They

were practice jums, and fortunately, nobody was injured,

Inasmuch as none of these individuals has had any train

ing or experience, and they are not in adequate physical

condition.

On June 28, 1961, the "Miami Herald" contained

an article stating that Interpen's Coumander is the

"biggest, strongest and most handsome nember of the

lot, and

in his marine camouflage suit, Australian

article continues

by stating that Heming is convinced that the pro?

Communist Government of Cuba will be overthrown only

by infiltration of guerrilla fighters; that he and

his men live in a rooming house, and when they are

not on training exercises in the Everglades Swamps,

or parachuting

at an abandoned airfield, they practice

rigging parachutes in the street.

The article con

tinues

that neighbors have complained, but the police

contend there is nothing they can do.

Henming claims

he does not try to hide the fact that Interpen is

part of the International Anti-Commnist Brigade, which

is associated with the Revolutionary Junta of National

Liberation, led by Aureliano Sanchez Arango.

Re: Intercontinental Penetration Forces

MM T-1, on June 27, 1961, advised that on

that day, Hemming and three of his men went to Key

Largo, Florida,

later returned, and brought six

others with them to establish a

survival training

camp s metere in Key Largo in the Florida Keys. C*(u)

MM T-l explained that Heming met sone-

one who knew an individual owning property in Rey

Largo, and allowed them to use this property. MM T-1

explained that on June 28, 1961, representatives of

Marcos Perez Jimenez are going to visit the camp

site at Key Largo, and observe Hewing and his

eight

companions in their training maneuvers. MM T-1

said that Hemming will tell the Venezuelans that

this is just one of the many combat squads of Interpen,

and that many other squads are standing by at other

places. Hemming hopes to fool the Venezuelans into

giving him large donations of arus, equipment and

food.

On June 27, 1961, the United States Border

Patrol, Miami, advised that Inspector Harry Rhodes,

of the United

States Border Patrol at Homestead,

Florida, received a call from fishermen off Julia

Island in the Florida Keys that some shooting was

going on. Upon arrival, Inspector Rhodes discovered

that Herming and his group were conducting a jungle

survey training class, and Herming had in his possess-

ion only one .22 caliber rifle, a small amount of

ammunition and some equipment.

The rifle shot

apparently ricocheted and barely missed hitting
