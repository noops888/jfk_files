Criminal Division

SUBJECT: PUBLIC BANK OF DETROIT

PARTMENT OF JUSTICE

DATE:

JUL 3 1 1962

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

has completed an examination of the Public Bank in Detroit,

Michigan.

Attached hereto are the results of the examination

together with detailed allegations of specific violations

and irregularities.

By necessity the examination by FDIC was confined

to the bank itself.

Therefore, because of the possibility

of a conspiracy, it is imperative that further investigation

be conducted.

In this respect it is requested that the Bureau

thoroughly investigate this matter.

William P. French and

J. Paul Allred, Criminal Division Attorneys who are familiar

with this matter have been directed to make themselves availabl

to the Bureau and assist in any manner requested.

this matter preliminarily with the Agents to whon it will be

assigned on 8/2/62 or 8/3/82. French realizes that no detailed

discussion can be had until the Agents have had an opportunity

to review the enclosed

materlal and he will arange for such

a detailed discussion

at a mutually agreeable time at a future

date.

French will have with him on 8/2-3/62 FDIC Examiner Thomas E.

Lindsey who supervised the FDIC examination and who is familiar

with the FDIC findings:

Detroit is instructed to have available on 8/2-3/62

the Agents who will be assigned to this matter for the indicated

discussion with French.

The Bureau should be advised by airtel

of the results of the discussion with French.

After this discussion

with French the Agents to whom this matter will be assigned should

review the enclosed material thoroughly and in detail and be

prepared to discuss same in detail with French at the future date

to be set by him.

According to French his present plan is to pursue in

this case only the loans totalling $800,000 made by the Public

Bank to certain of captioned subjects and coxporations, which

captioned matter be made the subjects of separate cases and dis

cussed with the U.S. Attorney in the usual manner in which such

FRA matters are handled,

This, however, should not be done until

the dotalled discussion is had

with French and he explains his

desires in detail.

French will, however, retain control over

captioned matter

and copies of reports in this matter should not

be furnished the U.S. Attorney and he should not be consulted

for a prosecutive opinion.

French already has voluminous records which have been

subpoenaed by a Federal grand jury and will make these available

for examination at the proper time.

Detroit must afford this natter immediate, continuous

TOP PRIORITY investigative attention by as many Special Agents

as Teasile and practical, as soon as french explains the scope

thereof at the detailed discussion to be held with him, to insure
