Memorandum For: CI/RMO

Subject:

FOI Request Regarding List of West to East

Defectors, Including Lee H. OSHALD.

1. Paul L. HOCH, who has previously requested

information on Lee H. OSWALD and on the Assassination

of President kennedy, has now subnitted a request to

the National Archives for the release of a 1960

memorandun from the Department of State to CIA.

Attached to the nemorandum was a list of 12 US defectors

to Comnunist countries.

2. The Department of State has reviewed the

document and has

made its decision as follows:

The memorandu can be declassified,

but CIA should be involved in the decision because the

memorandum contains mention of DCID 4/2 and one of its

provisions.

b. The list attached to the memorandum

should not be released to the public donain because it

contains subjective judgements regarding Us citizens

and thus could constitute an invasion of privacy. The

Department lists three excoptions to this point:

William MARTIN, Bernon MITCHELL, and Lee H. OSWALD.

No suggest that ClA concur with the Department

of State, except as follows:

a. The memorandum should be released,

except for the sentence beginning with "Using the defi-

nitions of DCID 4/2".

Information Act. The requester is Paul L. Hoch

The worksheet attached to each document should be completed by the

docunent is involved, it would be appreciated it they could be returned at

to this date. . The IRS action officer is Charles Savige

5.

Remarks: This document is from the warren Commission RG. State/INR

sent it to the Agency earlier, but later decided that the clearances should

be obtained by NARS.

(It's also being sent to the FBI.) I don't believe

that it was reviewed by you the first time around. You'll note that, with

the exception of three names, State has denied the release of the "List of

American Defectors.!' If our Agency objects to any additional materials being

released, we will be the official deniers--but only tor those materiels.
