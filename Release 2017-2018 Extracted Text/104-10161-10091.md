LEAST AS FAR AS GOV IS CONCERNED. CAP AND GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN

HAVE ALL STATED THAT INCIDENT HAS ENDED AND ARE NOW TRYING TO

DIVERT ATTENTION TO OTHER SUBJECTS. MEDIA COVERAGE

IS RETURNING

TO NORMAL WITH STORIES OUT OF HEADLINES AND BACK ON PAGE SIX OR

EIGHT, SUPERSEDED BY NIEHOUS CASE, UGANDAN SITUATION, OPEC PRICE

HIKE, ETC. UNFORTUNATELY, EVERY. VENEZUELAN WEEKLY MAGAZINE HAS

• LONG ARTICLE (S) ON CIA WHICH ARE, OF COURSE, DEFAMATORY, AND

TEND TO WHIP UP PUBLIC ANTIPATHY TOWARDS AGENCY, THEN TOO, THERE

IS STILL MATTER OF DEMONSTRATION AGAINST CIA WHICH TWO DAYS AGO

CAP SEEMED TO BE INSTIGATING IN TWO MEETINGS WITH JOSE VICENTE

RANGEL AND POMPEYO MARQUEZ OF MAS AND JESUS

FAR I A OF THE POV. NEVERTHELESS, ON THE WHOLE, THE INTEREST

IN THIS ISSUE SEEMS TO BE DROPPING OFF AND DYING OUT RATHER

ALTHOUGH AMBASSADOR, STILL

SOMETHING OF A POLLYANNA AT SUCH TIMES, SERIOUSLY UNDERESTIMATED

CAPIS INTENTION TO

AN ACTION WHICH CAME WITHIN

ONE HOUR OF OCCURING. ANYWAY, THBROUGOUT ALL OF THIS

HAVE CONTINUED THEIR CONTACTS AND HAVE TRIED TO BE AS

24

FRIENDLY AND UNDERSTANDING, PERHAPS EVEN

HELPFUL, AS

SITUATION

WOULD ALLOW, TYPICAL OF

ATTITUDE IS

CONVERSATION WITH CRYMM DURING PEAK OF CRISIS

→ le

HAVING DISCUSSED A VARIETY OF TOPICS OF

INTEREST,

ASKED CRYMMO. "WELL OTHERWISE, HOW ARE THINGS GOING?"

CRYMM REPLIED, " YOU WHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT", TO WHICH

JSAID, SOMEWHAT GLUMLY, "YET, I SUPPOSE SO'.

4. WE SHOULD NOT FOOL OURSELVES IN THINKING THAT THE WORLD

HERE IS NOT DIFFERENT, HOWEVER.

SO, AS CAN BE SEEN BY ALL OF THIS,

THE RELATIVELY EASY OPERATING CONDITIONS OF THE RECENT PAST NO

LONGER PERTAIN- PERHAPS THEY NEVER WILL AGAIN- ÄND WHILE WE ARE

NOT BECOMING PARANOID NOR WILL. WE BE UNDULY SPOOKED, WE HAVE

ADJUSTED TO THE NEW AMBIENTE AND ARE NOW BEING MUCH MORE

•CONSERVATIVE AND CAUTIOUS IN OUR ACTIVITIES THAN BEFORE.
