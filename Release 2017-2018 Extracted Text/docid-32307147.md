scheduled to go to Mexico on Sunday, 11/26/70, at the

latest.

Source furnished the tag as lE-22868 which was

registered to Hertz, Miami Airport.

Investigation at Hertz determined a 1971 Cougar,

yellow, Vehicle Identification Number 1F91H504174 bearing

1971 Florida tag lE-22868, had been rented on 10/19/70,

at the Miami Airport on a credit card in the name of

RICHARD NORIAN.

A 1970 Ford Galaxie, four door, medium

green, VIN ON56H127192, bearing 1971 Florida tag 1E-8437

had been rented the following day on the same credit card.

Neither vehicle had been returned. Hertz was advised of

the location of the Cougar, but was unable to locate it.

Subsequently a JOHN DOE warrant was issued for both vehicles

for Obtaining a Motor Vehicle through trick, deceit,

fraud, etc - a felony in Florida..

On 11/24/70, MM: 1406-C advised the Cougar

had returned to the Moongate Motel on 11/23/70, and later

gone to a restaurant. It was being driven by two white

individuals, sex unknown.

Source stated the Cougar was then back at the

Moongate.

Buagents staked out the vehicle until the

Hallandale Police Department arrived to have the vehicle

impounded. It was dusted for latents and the individuals

in custody of the vehicle were located on the other side

of the motel.

They were identified as FRANK LESLIE MERRITT,

28 years old, white male, and his girl friend, WYLENE MAYS.

They alleged they hacl been loaned the car by an individual

named HANK MICHAELS, but were linable to further

identify

MICHAELS or furnish

his whereabouts. They were not

questioned concerning other members of the ring in order

not to expose above sources or unduly alarm the other members.

PCI HARTE subsequently advisea MERRITT was

considered too hot to associate with since the Cougar was

impounded and all have avoided any contact with him.
