MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

UBJBCT: Minutes of Meeting, the ay, a Ed 19(Augented) on

PRESENT:

General Taylor, MI.

Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, Mr. McCone

and General Parker

1. Mr. Johnson reported that the Italian representative at

the UN has now been briefed on the proposal to approach the Cubans

with an offer of food or medicine in exchange for the Playa Giron

prisoners. He noted that no specifics had been agreed on, and the

first contact would be for the purpose of establishing in principal

the possibility of such an exchange.

2.

Mr. McCone reiterated that all reports of Cuban inter-

vention in the Hemisphere are proving to have no substance when they

are actually run down.

In answer to General Taylor's question as to

what the U.S. might do if hard evidence of this kind is obtained,

Mr. Johnson pointed out that a subcommittee of the CAS, on security,

had been

authorized at Punta del Este.

This committee was given the

authority to mobilize multi-national action against the Castro regime

in the event that such hard information is obtained. It was agreed

that whatever information becomes available should be given to General

White, who is the U.S. representative on this subcommittee.

3.

Mr. McCone said that after studying the possibility of

using Cuban air crews, CIA had concluded that they would not be

suitable for supply drops at night.

On the other hand, trained U.S.

civilian crews could be provided by Civil Air Transport (CAT) in 30

days. Arrangements could be made to have these pilots ostensibly

employed by Cuban exile groups in the U.S. and, therefore, they would

be non-attributable to the U.S. Government.

He said that

available

Cubans could then be used for less demanding missions such as leaflet

drops. There appeared to be a general feeling on the part of the

shot down over Cuba.

Mr. McCone referred to-the Weekly Progress Reports which

are now being produced by CIA. He said these are required internally

within the Agency, and that to consolidate them with reporting from

other responsible departments and agencies would slow things up and

and make the report less useable. It was, therefore, agreed that

the CIA Progress Reports would continue to be produced every Tuesday,

and that a highlighted summary would be prepared weekly by General

Lansdale and forwarded to General Taylor's office for information of

the Group.

It was also agreed that General Lansdale should normally

brief the Group every other week.

5.

Mr. McCone expressed some impatience with

progress being

made on the project, and speculated as to whether it might not be

desirable to consider the possibility of a different approach. In

this

connection, he noted

that reconnaissance has revealed con-

siderably less Cuban military strength than had been expected.

General Taylor @sked that Mr. McCone give the Group, next Wednesday,

a summary of the intelligence received from reconnaissance and from

the debriefing of, exfiltrated agents.

The Group discussed at length the question of whether

the U.S. would actually welcome an excuse for overt intervention.

One of the points raised in this connection was the possibility of

massive death sentences for the Playa Giron prisoners, and whether

this would serve as a casus belli. The possibility of a quick

operation to liberate the prisoners was also mentioned.

that the time has now come when the basic philosophy of the pas eet
