Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1.

Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened

until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobil

intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIF

telephone company whor

landled

by a Station case officer.

The number

of lines tapped was

simited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers.

Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types. of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated

strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street

as the LIMITED site but

le middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

gate

of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photography

was located in one of a

+ 053

row of four houses

on

the south

af the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked

the

arden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this oper

was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel.

The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips.

LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early

due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED

and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American

staff officers.

These two officers organized

a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and

a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a

cept operation,

was a hip-

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wishes tell, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In

1958, at the instigation

of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation

came into existence.

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time.

The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961,

the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer.

Station

officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LIENVOY listening

past for the telephone numbers of the soviet, cubania Satellite Emi

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage the station immediately

The Mexicans saới

ereafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet Tines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

• conversations of

interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

cars with

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the

photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in

either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.
