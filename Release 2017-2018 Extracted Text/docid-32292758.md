In view of these findings, the Chicago Division

removed the present installation with the accompanying

wires to circumvent the forthcoming alterations and to

guarantee full

security.

Source was then replaced at the rear of MARCY's

office with wiring running through the outside street

wall' through the rear of the future offices and continuing

into outlet previously used.

This new source was reactivated 4/15/63; however,

the quality of reception is not

as good as the previous

source.

Re-entry for the purpose of improving reception

of source under the guarantee

of full security is planned

for 4/22/63.
