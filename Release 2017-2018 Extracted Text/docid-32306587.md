To advise you of current developments in our investigation

of Chicago Top Hoodlum Samuel M. Giancana in whom the Department has

expressed an interest. (4)

CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS

With reference to the report from a Chicago informant that

Giancana is in partnership with one Gus Allgauer in the Villa Moderne

Restaurant, Hyland Park,

Illinois, Allgauer has advised that Chicago

hoodlums Gus Alex and Frank Ferraro, together with their lieutenant

Hy Godfrey, have visited his restaurant frequently within the past

several weeks. On February 16, 1961, the group was accompanied by

Top Hoodlum Murray Humphreys,

and on February 20, Alex, Ferraro and

Godfrey had lunch at the restaurant. Allgauer claims he has no sympathy

for hoodlums visiting his restaurant but says he is not in a position

to keep them from patronizing his business. u

Investigation has disclosed that the Fireside Restaurant,

Lincolnwood, Illinois, which Allgauer previously owned was burned in

1958 by two

or three armed men who entered the premises forcing employee:

to lie on the floor and saturated the restaurant with gasoline after

which they set fire to it.

The total loss was approximately one million

dollars.

Insurance covered the full loss.

Investigators for insurance

companies were unable to ascertain the reason for the arson•

Robert V. Luongo,

manager of OpeRt the faministration 129

RCA, CannonSDurg,

Pennsylvania, has advised that the quantity of electroi

equipment consisting of radio phones which Sergeant Maher of the

Intelligence Unit, Chicago Police Department, recently located stored

in Chicago were a

charitable gift negotiated by Harold S. McClintock,

chairman of the Reclamation and Redemption Committee of the Disabled

American Veterans at Chicago.

This was the electronic equipment which

Sergeant Maher previously said appeared to have been purchased by

McClintock and others and concerning which he had received lone, report

that it might be sent to Cuba.

Further investigation is being conducted

to develop additional details concerning this matterju

Memorandum to Mr. Parsons

Re:

Samuel N. Giancana

Investigation of the Amber Light Lounge, which is reputed

to be a mail drop and meeting place for Giancana indicated this may

A be a house of prostitution.

Inquiry and observations reveals

the presence of numerous females of questionable background on these

premises.

D. E. Stephens, the Village President of Rosemont, Illinois,

advised he was contacted

several months ago by Rocco Potenzo and

offered $1,000 per month to permit gambling operations at the

Airliner Lounge in Rosemont: Stephens refused the offer and ordered

the gambling operations closed. Potenzo is the chief lieutenant of

Glancana for northwest suburbs and is reported to operate the

Airliner Lounge for Giancana. 4)

Giancana's brother, Charles Kane, also operates the Thunder-

bolt Motel for Giancana at Rosemont. Village President Stephens

advises he has seen Giancana in the motel on numerous occasions.

He expressed an intense dislike for him and said he would furnish

to the FBI identities of persons visiting the Thunderbolt Motel

together with license numbers of their automobiles. 4|

The Chicago Office and all other offices having leads

in this matter have been in tructed to follow this investigation

vigorously in efforts to develop a violation on Giancana as soon

as possible. (4)
