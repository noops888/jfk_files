for KUBAiK than they ever did before and KURk'e oholoe

of Cuban leadors - ANTINE and the mombers of the CONSEIJO.

In 140t,

throughout the entire intervier, Subjeot con-

trasted his suocosoos with the failures of other KUNANK

dirooted efforts.

• Ile contrastod the pre-invasion firet

team case offloors with the post invasion second team.

If the oxamines 1s allored to sun up the underlying,

but nover oloarly

expressed,

frase of reference which

Subjeot peos, It would be this: Prior to the invasion,

KUNIRK workod with the Cubans in an attenpt so defsat

Castro.

Ever sinoo the invasion, illARd has inoreasingly

moved in the dirootion of using the Cubans for endo whioh

are often olouded. In taking the LOFLUTTER Subjeot v

signaled his acoeptanoe of the new order.

Ho has: apparnutly

deoided that without KUBANK old, he oan do nothing -

although he is atill not sure what can be done vith 1t.

He was willing to gu on reoord by rospording in the affirma-

tive to the question asked on the test. :

"Do you feel that KUnARk"s handling of the Cuban

situation has

been inept?"

Subleet would not cooperate with AUBAl.

he (AMDENIM/1) rooelved

infomation whioh he knew would be

of Interest to KUBAlls, would he refrain from reporting 1t

$ 1.

he decided it was

not in the best interests of the. Cubans

hase to report.

Ho noted that most Cubans know of his

relationahip with KUDARK and they would rofrain fron selling

his anything they did not want to reaoh KulArk.

In addition to questione rolating to foreign intelligonce

and commnisa subleot was asked:

Excepting

the Un and CL-66,

are you involved with

any othor politioal or mvolutionary group?

Do you have a relationship with any person or group

which you are doliberately concealing fros KUBAlLi?

Have you used any KUBARK funds da any unauthorized

mannerg

This question noant had he used KIMANK fuads
