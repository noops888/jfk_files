REF 3

SMANI -9539, DIR-39952

do Attached aro tuo coules of a memorandum for the record on the Subject of a

contact batueon Robart F. CHATHAM and "Profesaor LAURA" to uhon roferonco was

nade in both 4A1192539 and DIR-39952. Thia contact lao nado at tha requaat

of the doputy chief to MIDWATCH.

A saniticod copy of the manorandum has

boon transmitted to the MiINATCH offica.

Any action in furtherance of the

docusalong described in the memorandum would necossarily be talen by the

local ODACID eatablishment.

2.

No plans are presently known for extending ONACID support to Subjoct; hou

ovor, if any ouch support vere to be given by private parsons (such as

Socrotary ARANETA) thie probably would not becono known to ODYOKE circles.

30

It appeared fron his renarks that Subject had not contacted KUBARE channole

In tho courco of hio current Aaian tour - eithor in India or Indochina.

Disoret questioning revealed that the 2 March meeting under ARANETA O

sponsorohip uns evidently Subjoct's firat direct appeal, in tha courso of

bio current tour, to obYoke for aboidtance.

Howaver, Subject may have been

withholding datails of othor contacts with ODYOKE roprecontatives, Thia

would appaar a valld assumption in viow of the fact that he doniad in

response to a question that he had contacted ODOlE representatives recant

Ly in Hong Kong (per gargraph five of (SHAND, 9539).

22

Lo With roference to tho potontial for KUBARS purposes of Subject'a organisation,

1t bocane manifestly apparent in the course of his remarka that no cohesive

veriolo exiets for the purposes he deseribed (horover laudatory his purposos,

porticularly in tha Hanoi-Haiphong arcas), that Subject has given only

Lanited attontion to the types of materiala to be disseminatad by hio

"friends", and that Subject appeared to bo far too unayotonatie to be

entrusted with anything but the finighed product in quantity (rather than

fundo to arrange for ite publication).
