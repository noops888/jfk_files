by the Department of Justice. SA/DDCI Smith said the three individuals

probably were Nosenko, Golitzyn, and Deriabin. Lapham said this procedure

Mi. Carlucci said that

a strategy has been developed regarding how to handle this problem with the

would include the stipulation that the Committee would

that as part of Cuba's 26 July celebration, a double agent will march ir

that Cubans were involved in President Kennedy's assassination. Castro

also plans to announce CIA activities in Africa to track the Cuban presence

there. Hetu told Reynolds that he hesitated to comment at the present time

but the charge regarding the Kennedy assassination was ridiculous.

McMahon summarized an FBI report that a Cuban Intelligence Service

official has been

in contact with an unidentified journalist in connection

stated that the festival will include a tribunal that will condemn CIA

activities throughout the world. It will also reveal the above-mentioned

assassination.

Former CIA agents will be revealed as well as proof of CIA

activities in Africa. This report also mentioned that a press conference

this matter.

Mr. Carlucci then explained that Angleton had asked for

access to the files two days before he was to appear in executive session

before Congress and he was therefore granted access to prepare for his

testimony. He did not come to review the files prior to his Congressional

appearance, however, and then later asked for substantially more informa-

Lapham outlined his meeting yesterday with former C/CI Angleton regard-

ing the latter's lawsuit. Angleton is seeking access to classified documents

to rebut former employee

Hart's testimony before the House Assassinations

Committee.

Laphan suggested that the Agency may want to consider granting

Angleton access to these documents apart from his lawsuit. Doing so would

require at least obtaining an updated clearance for Angleton. In response

to the Director's question if Angleton had been seriously maligned by the

Hart testimony, Lapham said that it was difficult to say, but Angleton

certainly thinks so.

In response to McMahon's comment, Lapham agreed that

the Agency could make these documents available to the Committee, but the

Committee is running out of time, and Angleton would not want to comment on

them without seeing them personally.

In response to Lapham's question,

attendees noted that former employees were permitted to review classified

papers prior to testifying before the Church Committee. (AIUO)
