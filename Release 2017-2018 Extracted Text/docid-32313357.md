Erom descriptions furnished it appeared à man he knew anly

as Bellabias or

• (PH) and a young student introduced by

MOURAD

DAJANY vere actually MEDAN and ZUTA.

Later, when photos

exhibited to subject, he identified photo of MEDAN as

MOURAD and

one of ZUTA as person introduced by MOURAD. (He claimed this

person was introduced by name but he could not recall it and did

not recognize name, ZUTA)

Claimed he met MOURAD in a cafe in Jerusalem in 1946 or

1947. A couple of years ago, MOURAD somehow contacted subject and

said he was passing through WDC and wanted to renew acquaintanceship.

MOURAD, according to DAJANY, was

a student at Columbia or New Xork

University in NY, and writing thesis in economics and wanted MAJANY' S

help-and Ideas.

DAJANY Said MOURAD was in WDC about once a month

and they met and went out for a dirnk or a meal and discussed

current topics, mutual friends and persons who were either known

by DAJANY Or MOURAD. DAJANY said he never furnished MOURAD information

about his work at the International Bank, never introduced MOURAD

to Arab acquaintances and claimed he never received money from

MOURAD, Widti.He did not know to be employed by the Israeli

Government in any capacity.

receiving magazine, he was observed to take white envelope from

insode magazine and later deposit in bank $350.00) DAJANY categorically

denied that he received money.

Stated on at least two occasions

magazines were received from MOURAD and on

one occasion magazine

contained a thesis MOURAD was preparing.

DAJANY has seen man introduced to him by MOURAD only

on two occasions, once with MOURAD and next time alone.. This man is

a student, living in Baltimore.

Appeared this individual was merely

being sociable for he never asked DAJANY for anything and DAJANY

did not receive anything in return.

Man spoke Arabic and appeared

to know where the DAJANY property was in Jerusalem.

When asked if he had not received sums of money from the

Israelis, DAJANY denied this strongly.

Later, however, he said

chat on a fairly regular basis some of his friends or relatives

on coming to the US would bring money on occasions, the amounts (5)

were either by check, bank drafts or cash.

Subject also

recalled that about three years ago he met a citizen and realtter

of Israel in Europe who spoke with him about the arrangement whereby

DAJANY could apply for amounts up to $100.00 and later $200.00 per

month from rental of property owned by DAJANY family.

Through the

Custodian of Enemy Property in Israel 5f DAJANY

submitted

application and thereafter has received various amounts of money

through his family. (Incidentally his three brothers and mother are

in Beirut, Lebanon). This money came to him directly from Lebanon

in form of cash, bank drafts and checks.

was actually furnished to the DAJANY family subject does not know.

Subject has no accounting on amounts received to date and claims

this is being stopped because of some arrangenent or hag already

ceased since last received money in May

or June, ' 1959.

On departing from agents after being questioned repeatedly

on receipt of funds, which he could not logically account, subject

said he would report to the FBI upon return from his present trip,

and after he has had an opportunity to talk with his family in

Lebanon, and report the true story, a story which he said "would

make you laugh".

When asked if it would not be advantageous to

furnish the truth now, DAJANY said he could not until he got permission

of his family.

On termination of meeting, DAJANY advised he would keep

matter in extreme confidence and would report promptly any contacts

with the Israelis for any purpose. (S)

It is to be noted that DAJANY'S accounts of his contacts

with other

than known Israeli intelligence operators were obviously

true, however, his accounts of contacts with MOURAD (MEDAN) and

ZUTA

were just as false and fabricated. Repeated emphasis on the

obvious untruths on his opart merely

appears he is a pathological
