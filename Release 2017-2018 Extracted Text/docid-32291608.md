of exiled Venezuelans residing in the Miami area, advised

they were not

acquainted with LOUIS MARTINEZ, and possessed

no information that any Venezuelans in the Miami area were

endeavoring to purchase a ship.

an idèntifiable reference to LOUIS MARTINEZ, which would

indicate he has endeavored to contact the Miami Office. The

MARTINEZ, already in the possession of the New York Office,

the Washington Field Office and the Cleveland Office.

On 10/9/61, IC CLIFFORD M. WERNER contacted the
