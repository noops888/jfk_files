area engaged in conspiracies to illegally ship arms outside the United

States, including JESSE A VICKERS, who was recently pleaded nollo

contendere in Federal Court, New York City, on such a charge.

This office ceased contact with DARLOW à number of months

ago when it appeared that practically all the information he was able

to furnish related to matters within the primary jurisdiction of

Customs.

On January 28, 1955, JAMES OFFUTT, Assistant Supervising

Customs Agent, Miami, advised that the information relating to the

activity of the operators of Ernie's Garage, as set forth in the Legat

letter of January 18,

to the U. S. Customs office a short time ago, and reported similar

information concerning MARCOS PIEZ, and one ROBERTO who drives a red

convertible automobile.

Mr. OFFUTT said that he is still maintaining frequent

contact with DARLOW and feels that he is pretty well informed concerning

DARLOWs present activities.

He pointed out that DARLOW kept several

guns in his garage, including a Harrington & Richardson rifle, with

a sawed-off barrel, which he had been passing off to various "hanger's

on" as a machine gun.
