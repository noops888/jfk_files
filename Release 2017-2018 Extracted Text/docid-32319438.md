April 28, 1970

MR. KEITH HOSKINGS

On April 20, 1970, a check of records of New

Scotland Yard, London,

England,

reflected that KEITH

HOSKINGS was born October 8, 1928,

in St. Kitts, British

West Indies. He arrived in

the United Kingdom in 1958

and resides with his mother at 16, Gap Road, Wimbledon,

London. S.w. 19. In 1960 he was arrested and convicted

for theft and as of April 27, 1970 was about to be ar-

rested again by Metropolitan

Police, London, for larceny

of money from his employer.

On April 24, 1970, Detective Sergeant FRED

PARISH, New Scotland Yard, London,

Interviewed HOSKINGS

at his residence.

He described HOSKINGS as a white male

with West Indian accent.

He has persisted in saying to

the police that he was not well enough to stand trial

for his present offence of larceny from his employer and

it is believed that the letters he has written to the

F.B.I. at Washington and Dallas, as well as letters to *

American Embassy, London, U.S. Air Force Headquarters,

Scotland Yard, London, have all been

an

attempt on his part to say that he has been cooperating

with New Scotland Yard and the F.B.I. in solving major

crimes, which he hoped would act in mitigation for his

current offense of larceny from his employer.

When interviewed by Sgt. PARISH; he professed

intimate knowledge of all the current major crimes in London,

including a kidnaping and murder case and an espionage case

currently being tried.

He also claimed to have been a member

of the Mafia sent to England.

Sergeant PARISH is of the opinion that because of

subject's mental instability he thought he mightebe immedi-

ately brought to the U.S. to assist U.s, authorities, thus

saving himself from being arrested and sentenced in, London.
