PCI

had heard of the

outside bookmakers that came into Houston and

"stiffed"

some of the local players, and of these individuals

possibly being connected to STRAUS.

BULLER has had

little or no contact with STRAUS since he got out in

July and had

not learned any detail of these operations.

He now realizes that these individuals who are cheats

and possible heisters are detrimental to the other

gamblers in Houston, and he expressed a desire to cooperate

in furnishing anything he can dig up regarding them. He

advised he is willing to furnish whatever information he

can aslong as it is maintained in confidence.

He fully

realizes that if he violates any Federal laws, he is

subject to prosecution.
