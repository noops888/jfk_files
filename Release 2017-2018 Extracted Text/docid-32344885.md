RODRIcuEZ phones the following telegram to DIAZ, which was

received from CASERO:

ifter the assassination of President Xennedy, facts have ben hringing

un to light a sinister plot.

Contrad/ ction, reveal that Oswald was either

convicted by

the Folice of repared. to plan the assassination (not clear),

with the pronice of letting him escape aftertards, so

as to insinuate or make

the responsibility fall upon tose whom the aotual authors wanted to blome.

It is clear that revotionary North Americans ranted to nake Cuia and tie world

victins of their criminal purposes even at the extent of assassinating the

President. They sent Oswald to Mexioo to ask fur an in-transit visa for

Cuba ard then go to the USSk. Imagine the President's assassin just returning

from the USSR and going to Cubal. He could have asked for an USSR visa in

some European countie much much closer than Cube without coning to Cuba and

then returning to the USSR.

On or about 1970 we will be able, to surpess 10 nillions tons of sugai..

and export it. Boonowy Boonowy getting firmly better, yehave already sold sugar.

at about 10 cents for 1065 or 2966. By the end of this joer, nouget, wine

and traves will semppear, in the narket as a result of the exterior commerce.
