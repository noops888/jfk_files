Station views on the operation are summarized below.

The AMTRUNK operation has the following disadvantages or weak-

tacts.

An undercurrent of friction has recently developed between

AMICE/14 and AMTRUNK/3 which manifested itself in a fistfight on

29 March.

This was precipitated by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14

the Cuban term for a.

homosexual, the ultimate insult to a Cuban.

This in turn gives rise to the

question whether AMICE/14, with

possible history of homosexual activity (see UFGA-8411), has made

such an approach to AMTRUNK/3.

D.

The commitments made to AMICE/27 or which AMICE/27 claims were

made to him are

of concern to the Station.

This is an

area over which future misunderstanding or aggravation might easily

PROJECT ANTRUNK OPERATIONAL REVIEW

I.

STATUS REPORT ON TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH.

The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27;

AMICE/14, AMTRUNK/2,

•and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March 1963 at Safesite #164

on Plantation Key.

Andrew S. PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from

headquarters, was already at the training site when the team

was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS

and Hobart J. VANDEBORN.

PARMERS remained at the safesite

until 16 March during which time he conducted training in

clandestine methods and techniques.. This training included

security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-

tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management,

and operational planning

and reporting.

The training included

group discussion and participation in a series of appropriate

operational situations, several problems, and daily

physical

training.

During this two week period, either PEGGINS OI

VANDEBORN visited the safesite every

day, spending an average

of two or three hours with the group in operational dis-

cussions and processing.

During the week of 18 thru 23 March,

both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,

debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, workin

out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing

their training on an informal basis.

The week of 25 through

30 March was

spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass

and map reading, including two night problems, and on weapons

familiarization

and firing.

During the period under dis-

cussion the AMTRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED, were assessed

by the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series

of immunizations, were issued clothing, were processed for

alias documentation, were processed for disguises,

and were

further processed on cover and finance problems.

The ré-

sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were

sent to headquarters

under cover of UFGA-8111, on 13 March 1963.

Based on DIR

26430, no further LCFLUTTER is planned at the present time.

Transmitted as attachment "A" to this dispatch is PARMERS

report on his training of the ANTRUNK group, transmitted as

attachment "B" are the results of the assessments of the

AMTRUNK group,

and transmitted as attachment "C" is the

training report for the week of 25 March.

This secondary mission

is exploratory in nature only,

In order

to accomplish the foregoing missions,

the operation has been split into two initial phases, which

the black infiltration of AMTRUNk/2 and on the north coast

the black infiltration

of Havana province.

These two individuals plan to go into

Havana for a period of approximately two weeks, and then

they infiltrated.

These two individuals will likewise go into

Havana for a period of several weeks and then exfiltrate black:

These two phases are discussed in detail in following para-

graphs. Phase One and Phase Two are preliminary infiltrations

designed to set up intiltration extiltration routes and to

make initial contacts among certain select high level military

figures in Havana.

phases are not designed

On the other hand he is

quite loyal to A/2 and his quick wit is appealing to his

He worked under A/2 in the underground

avoided detection

and continued to engage in underground activities.

Finally

when the situation

became hopeless he left Cuba by air for

Miami in (AuguSt 1962.

While A/3 has performed

satisfactorily

in his training up to date, his performance falls far short

of the other three members.

B.

Fortunately his

role in this operation is comparatively minor and he appears

willing to comply with whatever A/2 decides.

Nevertheless,

direct control of A/3 offers problems in the future.

TASKS

1.

Conduct black infiltration landing at Punta La Jijira

(AMS 37851 and establish contact with the farm manager at

_in theel

section?

Through contacts of A/3 obtain transportation for A/2

to Guanaba or Havana.

Although not definite, A/3 may remain at his!

train assets in maritime reception and clandestine

communications.

Having completed this he would then be ex-

filtrated at Punta Jijira.

4.

A/2 will go to Havana and obtain safehouse and operational

support through his contacts.

A/2 will contact and develop two potential assets with

high level connections within the Rebel Army.

6. A/2 will train support and operational assets in clandes-

tine communications as well as arrange for

transportation for

his exfiltration.

INFIL-EXFIL PLANS

1.

The tentative date for the infiltration of A/2 and 3 at

Punta La Jijira is 18 May 1963.

The infiltrees will make

their way to

farm one kilometer

and from there A/2 will be provided with transportation to go

to Guanabo or Havana.

2.

The exfiltration of A/3 will occur three days

after his

infiltration,

This arrangment, as yet, is not definite.

3.

The exfiltration of A/2 is tentatively planned for 31

May 1963 at Punta La Jijira or Puerto Escondido.

A/3 feels

that Puerto Escondido would afford a more secure point for

exfiltration but that a reconnaisance of the area would be

necessary before final decision is reached.

Prearranged

telegram signal would indicate his preference.

The above

dates fall within a favorable moon phase for

maritime operations.

In addition the infil-exfil schedule

will allow for an extra margin beyond the 10 days which A/2

considers the minimum acceptable period of time to make his

contacts..

D.

OPERATIONAL ASSETS WITHIN CUBA

His father, now deceased, was a prominent individual in law

and politics and was at one time a senator. A/27 himself

graduated from law school in Habana and was a practising

lawyer.

In 1959 he became legal adviser to Camilio Cienfuegos.

Following the disappearance of Cienfuegos in October 1959,

A/27 began to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

In May 1961, at which time he'held the

position of Under-

activities. had come. to the attention of the government and

he took refuge along with his wife in the Venezuelan Embassy.

He was given safe conduct from the Embassy to PBPRIME in late

in PBPRIME in February 1963.

He had previously assisted A/14 in infils and exfils and

B. TASKS

1. Make preliminary black maritime infiltration by small

boat onto Cinco Leguas Key (AMS Map 4085 III) to contact

individuals who formerly assisted AMICE/14 in inf11-exf11

operations.

2.. Through contacts on Cinco Leguas Key, organize a ratline

into the mainland, including making arrangements for trans-

portation into Havana.

3.:

Through the mechanism established above,

move to Havana

and obtain safehousing. and operational support.

Make all necessary arrangements for subsequent exfil-

tration and future infiltrations.

5. Approach and recruit two key individuals with contacts

among Important military figures.

6. Establish internal and external communications.

7.. Exfiltrate from Phase II.

C.. INFIL-EXFIL PLANS

23 Aprid

Subjects.will take a small boat with silent motor

three days, during which time they will remain black, keep

the boat hidden in the mangroves, and contact individuals

known to them on Cinco Leguas.

They will make arrangements

with contacts at that point to re-activate contacts of AMICE/14

on the mainland at Casualidad (Map 4085 III, Grid Square 1747)

and contacts in the town of Marti and Cardenas. Plans will be
