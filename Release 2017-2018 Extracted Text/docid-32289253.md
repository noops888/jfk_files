chauffeur ALEX.

WARD also furnished information that LADON

has now changed his pattern in that he now takes his car

Irom the garage around 10 a.m., whereas his former procedure

was to take the car before 9 a.m., and sometimes before 8 a.m.

A surveillance of "BUTCH" LADON on October 15,

entered the Beach Garage at 10:21 a.m. and left it at

10:22 a.m., driving the above mentioned Cadillac.

At 10:37 a.m.

LADON exited from Lake Shore Drive at the Fullerton Street

exit. At 10:52 a.m., the above described Cadillac was

observed in a parking space at 320 Oakdale, the residence

Of EDDIE VOGEL and FRANK FERRARO.

It is noted that LADON previous to his employment

as a chauffeur by ALEX was a chauffeur-body guard for EDDIE

VOGEL, and the above information tends to indicate that

LADON

has resumed his association with VOGEL.

LOUIS TORNABENE

As has been previously reported, LOUIS TORNA BENE

is a close associate of GUS ALEX, and operates handbooks

in the Loop area of Chicago, over which ALEX allegedly

holds the principal interest. T-5 advised on September 24,

1958, that for the past six months he has been a partner

Of LOUIS TORNABENE in a gambling establishment which the

informant and TORNABENE operated

at the Santa Fe Hotel,

colk ana bearborn streets, chicago.

During the course

of this

joint venture, T-5 stated that TORNABENE became

obligated to him in the amount of approximately $15,000.00,

as well as a personal gambling debt

additional $4,000.00.

amounting to an

TORNABENE refused to pay the

informant his

winnings because the informant had quit on

a specific crap game in which TORNABENE was playing against

other persons, some being backed by the informant. The

informant, at

the time of quitting, was winning money from

TORNABENE.

The informant contacted SAM BATTAGLIA, highly

placed Chicago hoodlum, through an intermediary and BATTAGLIA

sent an individual named FNU POPE to see the informant.

POPE said he would

have to get both sides of the story in

regards to the gambling debtaand would have a ruling in a day

or two.

Prior to the informant's contact with SAM BATTAGLIA,

LOUIS TORNABENE had sent two hoodlums: to his house, obviously

with the intent to threaten the informant to take no further

and then decided

to go directly to SAMBATTAGLIA to force the issue.

and POPE.

At':that time also present was an individual known as

"Chappie,

"Who is a close associate of LOUIS TORNABENE and

GUS ALEX in gambling operations.

The informant advised

CHAPPIE at this meeting would directly represent GUS ALEX'S

interest in the dispute.

The informant advised that POPE,

the representative of SAM BATTAGLIA,

was described as white,

male, Italian, 55, light complected, average height and

"skinny."

It was decided at the meeting that TORNABENE owed

the informant no money from the gambling debt. TORNABENE

stated that the informant was being charged expenses for the

operations of TORNABENE's bookie joint and that his share in

the winnings less expenses would be $4,600.00, which TORNABENE

was obligated to pay and was, in fact, paying of

Informant advised that POPE had contacted MAISI BAER, Chicago

hoodlum,

prior to the meeting and that BAER, knowing the

informant, sided with him in the dispute. The informant

lée.

advised that the entire situation cost him $10,000.00 and

the interesting point was that it showed the power of GUS

ALEX's influence in the syndicate setup.

He advised that

spite of SAM BATTAGLIA, POPE and MAISH BAER siding with him,

GUS ALEX's weight thrown to TORNABENE's side of the issue was

sufficient to settle the dispute in TORNABENE's favor with no

objection from any of the other participants in the conversation.

The informant further advised on October 8, 1958, that he felt

that he had been muscled out of money, honestly owed to him

eastern contacts, which would be the former

Gang, of whom there are a few members 'left operating on the

East Coast, who are very powerful in the Jersey City and New

York City area.. The informant hoped through this connection

to have contact made directly to TONY ACCARDO, who would then

settle the dispute himself.

The informant advised that if he

is successful with his East Coast contacts, they will send

a man to chicago to make the contact with ACCARDO.. He

advised he would keep this office advised of the entire

situation as it develops.

The informant further advised that LOUIS TORNABENE

has huge sums of money available at all times for his gambling

operations and that he maintains several safety deposit boxes

at the central National Bank, located east of halsted street

on the north side of Roosevelt Road.

He advised that this

bank is also used

as a place for storing gambling money by

other hoodlums in the Chicago area; however, he did not know

specific individuals outside of TORNABENE using the

bank's facilities.

T-5 further advised that during the period of time

when he was in close contact and in the good graces of LOUIS

TORNABENE, TORNABENE boasted to him that GUS ALEX is anxious

to lend him $20,000.00 for TORNABENE's own use in bookmaking.

TORNABENE stated that he has not accepted the twenty grand

but also said that GUS ALEX has offered-part of the policy

racket on the South Side of Chicago.

TORNABENE indicated

that he is interested in the policy angle.

HENRY SUSK

Attention is drawn to the fact that it has

previously been reported that HENRY SUSK is a close friend

Of GUS ALEX, and that SUSK has furnished ALEX with several

automobiles, which remain registered to SUSK but are used

principally by ALEX.

Also, that SUSK has furnished a

diner's credit card

to ALEX, and that ALEX utilizes this

card for meals.

T-I advised that on September 26, 1958, HENRY

SUSK dined with GUS and MARIANNE ALEX, and

that MARIANNE

ALEX attempted to do the cooking on this occasion and

burned both the steak and potatoes, which she attempted

to cook.

EDDIE VOGEL

Reported above under the caption, "NATHAN 'BUTCH'

LADON"

,. is information that SAs FRANKFURT and ROEMER observed

LADON drive the Cadillag which he has been using to chauffeur

ALEX, to the residence of EDDIE VOGEL, on October 15, 1958.

On October 20, 1950, SA FRANKFURT observed LADON driving

this same automobile with VOGEL as a passenger.

to be "The Boss of the Loop" for the

• Chicago Crime Syndicate.

He stated that any problems which arise among gamblers in the

Loop are settled by GUS ALEX,

and that he feels certain that

no bookie can operate in the Loop without the sanction of

ALEX.

He reiterated information in this regard, which he has

furnished previously concerning the attempt of a prominent

hoodlum to

"muscle"

stated that he continues to operate free from such

in on the informant's business muscling

after he successfully sought the intervention and protection

of ALEX.

He feels that this continued "guardianship" of GUS

ALEX has enabled him to operate in the Loop free from hoodlum

interference and free from the usual fifty per cent which the

It is noted that above

inder the caption

and the sub-caption "LOUIS

TORNABENE" information is set out concerning the intervention

Of GUS ALEX in a dispute between T-5 and LOUIS TORNA BENE.

As noted above, the informant stated that one of the most

significant things to him in the entire dispute was the fact

that in spite of the weight of SAM BATTAGLIA, who is regarded

among hoodlums

in Chicago as a very influential syndicate

Leader coupled with MaISH BAER, who is also highly regarded

among Chicago hoodlums although not so much so as BATTAGLIA,

and one POPE, the fact that GUS ALEX sided with TORNABENE

in the issue was sufficient to settle the dispute in

TORNABENE's favor with no objection from BATTAGLIA, BAER,

or POPE.

It is noted further that this dispute concerned

a gambling operation in the santa Fe Hotel, located at Poll

and Dearborn Streets in the first ward of Chicago. This

information would, therefore, tend to substantiate information

previously reported that GUS

ALEX controls the first ward for

the syndicate.

The first ward includes the Loop,

the near

South Side, and the near West Side, being Chicago's largest

geographic ward.

T-8 and T-9, who have furnished reliable information

in the past, were

contacted during October, 1958.

These

individuals

are very well acquainted with many hoodlums and

particularly with individuals engaged in the policy racket

on the South Side of Chicago.
