In mid-March, 1965, Rafael Garcia Bongo, a noted

Cuban lawyer whose brother occupied the prestigious position

of Minister of Sports in Cuba, contacted CIA Station

personnel

in

to inform the agency that "he was in contact with

a group of military officers who were planning to kill Castro"

(1967 ' I.G.:

Report, p..)...It quickly became clear to CIA

employees that Bongo's reference was to Cubila and the group

of military men who were allied with him in attempting to

depose Castro. Although the: 1967: and 1977 YI.G. Reports are

silent as to their attitude toward Bongo's information, it

must be assumed that they did not respond affirmatively since

the AMIASH operation was in progress at the time and Artime

was in the process of delivering arms caches to Cubela's people

within Cuba.

Interestingly, Bongo identified himself to Agency per-

sonnel as a lawyer for the Capri Hotel and Casino in Havana

who had been jailed in July. 1975 for a period of 75 days,

allegedly as

a reprisal for representing Santo Trafficante.

"Bongo's utilization of the short prison term to establish

his "bona fides" 1s questionable as Trafficante was in jail

during August 1959. For the Cuban government to wait for 3

years

to exact retribution for that representation makes no

sense. Possibly, Bongo was involved in approaching the Castro

a double agent for Castro in ascertaining the nature and

scope of the AMLASH operation. Castro certainly became

aware of the Artime meetings with Cubela in the fall of

1964 since the list of charges upon which Cubela went to

trial in 1966 began with these Madrid meetings. If Castro

had begun his suspicions of Cubela's role with the CIA dur-

ing late 1964 or early 1965, it is likely that he would have

begun counter-intelligence measures to confirm his fears

which could have led to Castro sending Bongo to Spain to

contact the Agency. Given Trafficante's close ties to Bongo

(see also Aleman-footnote in AMIASH"section), it can be postu-

lated that Trafficante was aware of Bongo's true mission

prior to his departure or became knowledgeable when he bailed

him out of jail in Madrid. (Unfortunately we-have no way of

knowing whether Bongo stopped in Miami to see Trafficante

prior to going to spain unless we could obtain the case file

from Secret Service of the Italian killed in Miami who was

supposed to be Bongo's partner according to S/A Wendall Sall.)

Trafficante" Could have received news of cubela's ties

with the Agency through his close associate Jorge Nobregas who

was described by Gorge Calie in his Washington Post article

(circa 8/17/76) as "having worked with the CIA, was in Cubela's

student revolutionary group in Cuba, and always close to

Trafficante."

Actually, given the extent of Trafficante's high-level

contacts within the exile community and the low-level security

CIA HAS RO OBJECTION TO

RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENT

in the CIA exile operations, it is extremely logical that

Trafficante and other members of the underworld knew, in

some fashion, part or all of the AMLASH plot. The question

becomes: So what? Short of being able to blackmail the go-

vernment about the modus operendi of the 1960-62 events,

the significance of mob knowledge of AMLASH is not readily

apparent. However, If Trafficante was in fact a double-agent,

a whole other scenario emerges. now?

One further reference to Bongo surfaced during an

interview by Comnittee Staff with Jose Aleman on Margh 14,

1977 when Aleman related that Jorge Nobregas introduced Ale-

man to Trafficante. Santo Trafficante offered to assist

Aleman in obtaining a Teamster loan ostensibly out of grati-

tude for Aleman's relative (Bongo) representing Trafficante

in Cuba.

Trafficante fully admits the Teamster loan proposal

which was to be arranged by Frank Ragano, Trafficante'e per-

sonal lawyer, who also represented Jimmy Hoffa and Frank Chanez

in criminal cases.

Of course, the most "relevant aspèct of the Trafficante-

Aleman meetings in September 1962 to this Committee is the

statement attributed to Trafficante by Aleman that ". . .you

don't understand me. Kennedy's not going to make it to the

election.

He is going to get hit." Aleman reported that

the inflamatory prediction occurred during a lengthy diatribe

against the Kennedy administration's campaign against Jimmy

INTRODUCTION

In its

concluding section of the Final Report A

Developments After the Warren Commission, the select Senate

Committee to Study Governmental Operation (SSC) speculated

that organized crime may have had a continuing knowledge

of all CIA opertions against Castro during the 1960's.

"The 1967 I.G. Report noted that information given

by "A" suggested a link between the AMIASH operation and the

1960-1962 CIA plots to assassinate Castro using underworld

contacts.

In other words, the information "A" provided

raised the possibility that underworld figures who were aware

of the assassination plots in which william Harvey partici-

pated,

may have also been aware of the AMLASH operation."

— A review of the 1967

I.G. report does not sustain

the Senate's conjecture in that there is no available evidence

cited in the Report to suggest that "A" (Victor Spinosa Hernan-

dez) had knowledge of, or involvement with, any of the syn-

dicate or Cuban exiles who participated in Phase I or II of

the CIA-Mafia assassination.plots during 1960-62. What Book

¡did was to seize upon the 1967's tentative identification

and AMASH intrigue, and expand the amorphus nature of those

"name links," which included "A," into a theory that "A" was.

the conduit through which the Syndicate became knowledgeable

of both the AMLASH operation and the initial CIA efforts to

eliminate Castro.

The only solid factual basis for Book Il's tie-in

between AMLASH and the 1960-62 CIA syndicate plots is

Pinned sunger upon Victor Espenosa's exile activities in June-

July 1963, which Book II Exilind

More, CIA files contained at least some FBI reports

"A, "'

the Cuban exile who was involved in transporting

explosives to New Orleans in 1963. These reports detail

his involvement with anti-Castro exiles and'underworld fi-

gures who were operating the guerilla training camp in New

Orleans in July 1963.

The "underworld figures" reference relates to Melie

and William McLaney who have been considered organized crime

affiliates by some law enforcement and media personnel.

(See profile.) Again, however, no evidence from any source

places McLaney into the early CIA plots to kill Castro or

into the AMLASH operation. A review of the June-July 1963

activities of McLaney and Victor Espinosa leads only to the

inference that, their operation was a private limited venture

with no agency or syndicate support and very little chance

of success. (See Review-of Lake Ponchatrain in McLaney Pro-

file. Footnote be Victor Espinosa.)

Moreover, the link between McLaney, Espinosa and the

organized crime principals connected to the initial CIA Castro

plots must be dissected in order to make a judgement as to

thre. 556

the likelihood of Book was speculation that the syndicate

held "inside" information on Agency operations in 1960-65.

since the senate did not attempt to interview either

of the McLaney brothers or Victor Espinosa in 1975 nor im

quire of the witnessests of

to the 1960-62 plots into oF

their knowledge or relationship to McLaney or Espinosa, the

Senate's hypothetical question of underworld knowledge of

the full range of CIA Castro plots is based upon a minimum

of hard data and a maximum of free-wheeling conjecture.

The evidence linking Espinosa to any known organized

crime figures consists of his admission to being friends with

"Cappy" Rothman, Norman Rothman's son, and

a casual knowledge

of American gamblers gleaned from his student days of visit-

ing the Havana casinos.

grease ties to

organized crime have been seriouly questioned within federal

law enforcement agencies since the 1950's but no solid evi-

dence has linked him to Trafficante, Rosseli or Giancana.

Since Mchaney has been most frequently mentioned as a "Lansky

man." To place a witting heLancy into the 1960-62 plots,

it requires a

series of major speculative hurdles which

include. (a) Myer Lansky was a plotter with Trafficante;

(b) Melaney was Lansky's "action" man; "fe) the various under-

world figures acted in concert in promoting anti-castro opera-

tions. None of these premises are easily supportable with
