Habana failed to reflect any pertinent information on

Party.

*Confidential Informant #656-1 points out in his

report that the police accused subject's brother of dis-

seminating seditious propaganda of

a Communist type and that

other members of her family were arrested at different times.

It should be borne in mind that the modus operandi of the

MACHADO police in arresting revolutionists and members of

groups in opposition to him was to accuse them of having

disseminated Communist propaganda which could be used as a

legal basis to incarcerate them or exile them from the

country as the Communist Party was operating illegally at

the time. This same modus operandi was used by the MACHADO

Regime to arrest many members of the opposition group who

are now and always bave been violently opposed to Communism.
