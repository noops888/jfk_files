MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

PHIL BUCHEN

THE PRESIDENT

In the intelligence evaluation currently underway, both in the

Congress and in the Executive Branch, I would be grateful if you

would direct special attention to two areas that have raised questions

in my mind. Please assemble this information independently and

provide it personally to me, together with your recommendations.

The first matter relates to the Warren Commission. You will

recall that Bill Colby mentioned to me certain assassination attempts,

sponsored by the Agency, on Castro.

As I recall, this conflicts with

what I recall was some of the information furnished to the Warren

Commission. The Warren Commission, as I remember, addressed

this question to see what, if any, relationship there may have been

to attempts on Castro, which would cause rataliation against Kennedy.

If you could review the record in the Warren Commission on this point,

it would be helpful. As I remember, those of ls on the Commission

got the impression the Agency has never engaged in such activities ra!-

Castro.

Dave Belan might be able to shed some light on this entire

question and I would be interested as to his recollection on this subject.

The second area in which I would like you to get some additional

information is on the Azorian-Matador Project. When did it begin?

What is the relationship with Hughes?" I first learned of this program

after I was well into my Vice Presidential term.

In fact, Admiral

Anderson of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board suggested that

I raise it with the Agency when I visited there. There was only one

short briefing and that did not go into the background of the project

which I understood had originated several years ago. The briefing

also did not go into cover arrangements in any depth.

Since becoming President, I have focused more on the status and

operation of this project, rather than the details of how it was put

together.

Perhaps it might be well for you to establish just what

has been the relationship of the Agency to Howard Hughes down through

the years.

Have there been other programs and projects which have

run through him or his organization?

I would be grateful for your

suggestions and guidance as to how you

think we should proceed once you have assembled

the

information I

have

requested.
