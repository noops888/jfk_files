Re Mani letter and liN to the Bureau, 1/20/790

5

On March 15, 1974, MM 1337-5 advised

that the ASI

and the JCR appear to be relatively dormant at the present

time.

He advised that CONRADO RODRIGUEZ SANCHEZ, head of

the ASI and a Director of JCR, is circulating around

DI. MANOLO REYES Of Miami who has aspirations of becoming

President of a Cuban government in exile, however, REYES has

been unable to build up a following of any significant

proportion.

It has been previously reported that action members

of the ASI, ABDALA and the Golden Falcons have joined together

to form a small terrorist organization known as the Frente de

Liberacion Nacional (FINC) which claims credit for a number of

attacks against Cuban fishing boats, the bombing of the

"Mereghan II" and two bombing attacks against the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico City during the past few months.

However, investi-

gation to date has failed to reflect the identity of any

member of the ASI who is specifically involved in these activities.

Miami will continue to investigate the ASI and the

JRC for any future pertinent developments.

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

Previous investigation has reflected that CONRADO

RODRIGUEZ SANCHEZ, a Cuban exile and former labor leader,

represents the ASI and JCR in Miami. The ASI is the labor

group of the JCR.

Both are anti-CASTRO exile groups with

membership in Miami and in the New York - New Jersey areas.

In August 1973, it was reported that RODRIGUEZ disclosed that

the ASI and JCR had agreed secretly with these other groups in

New York City to carry out attacks in that city.

CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS

On October 4, 1973, information was reported that

two Cuban fishing boats were attacked off the north coast of

Cuba.

A Havana radio broadcast identified these boats at the

"Cayo Largo 17" and the "Cayo Largo 34."
