MARLIN SUN BEAR did not appear

appear to have been kicked or beaten about the face. In

the jail, HARLIN and I talked and MARLIN nevor told me

anything about being beaten or struck in the face by

BISSONETTE was in the car at the time.

The car

started spinning forward as he was really gunning

it.

I. started running and opened the right front

door and jumped in. The door slammed shut behind

me and I

think it smashed my thumb.

The car started

spinning around, and I grabbed SUN

BEAR around the

neck to prevent him from getting on the highway. We

were fighting over the wheel too.

The car went into

a ditch and then hit a culvert, and

I think a post,

I bumped my

on the windshield when the car hit the post, and I

was knocked dizzy.

I just hung onto SUN BEAR then.

•I don't think SUN BEAR was injured.

JANIS was still

in the back seat and was injured.

JANIS busted his

nose, I think.

YANKTON, and I think LONG, came

running over to the car, and I let SUN BEAR go. Then

I sat on the seat and held my head, as I was dazed.

They pulled suN Bear from the car,

and that is all

I then went to my own police car and called

the Captain.

Then I loaded the prisoners into my

car and took them to the Pine Ridge Jail.

SUN BEAR

was still drunk at that time. He did not look like

he had been beaten.

"I,

RICHARD T. LITTLE, make the following

true and voluntary statement to JOHN RYAN THAYER

and

JAMES ALAN HILVERDA, who have identified

themselves to me as Special Agents of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation:

"I am 39 years of age, having been born

I have completed

four years of High School,

having completed the Van Nuyes Adult Night

School, Van Nuyes, California.

"About the second week in March, 1973,

1, along with several other persons, was at

the BILLY MILlS parking lot in Pine

Ridge, South

Dakota. This was also known as the Sioux

Nation parking lot.

We were waiting for the

appearance of Senators JIM ABOURESK and GEORGE

MC GOVERN. We wished to obtain from the

Senators

the status of the Wounded Knee

takeover. I would estimate there were 150

persons present.

At one

time RICHARD WILSON

and two of his body guards, GLOWN THREE STARS

and POKMi JOE MERRIVALO werE in the parking

Iot. WILSON left for a period and then came

back with approximately

25 other people who

I would describe as his "goon squad".

SKI

JACOBS, a Captain of the Pine Ridge Police

vepartment, called DAVE LONG OVer LOI the

purpose of

breaking up this group. JACOBS was

inforned that the

group was peaceful and that

no trouble was intended. JACOBS said, however,

that this group of people should be broken up.

DAVE LONG announced to the group that they should

leave. I went to my Ford Ranchero accompanied

by the past Tribal President ONE FEATHER:

Upon

approaching my pickup I was accosted by FARL DEON,

I. who stated that he would take me on at that

time.

I knew that some of WILSON's forces had

been drinking and about that time SKI told the

both of us to break it up. !I got in my pickup

and started out of the parking lot and at that

time I was stopped by GLENN THREE STARS.

GLENN

THREE STARS approached my vehicle and took a

swing at me which' I blocked with my left arm and

the blow of the force struck the

car door.

JACOBS

again came over and stopped the incident

and at that time I left the parking lot.

proceeded to the Wounded Knee junction where I met

a priest who was leaving the Wounded Knee site.

"We, GERALD ONE FEATHER and myself net with

this priest in order to obtain information

concerning what had taken place at Wounded Knee.

Upon leaving Wounded Knee Junction I then went

back to Pine Ridge and stopped at a Husky Station

in order to obtain gasoline.

At that point the

Area Director WYMAN BABBY and Superintendent STAN

LYMAN came by and asked me if I desired to make

a complaint.

I decided that I would make a

complaint and we proceeded to the Pine Ridge

Police Department.

While there Lieutenant MICHAEL

parking lot police officer mo had been in the

, made the statement that he had seer

nothing.

Though I knew he was there at the time

of the indident.

At that point I decided I would

not make a complaint on this incident to the Pine

Ridge Police Department as I felt that nothing

would be done about it.

I told off the officers

at the Police Department telling them in affect

"You can keep your damn complaint." I also stated

this to BABBY and LYMAN.

STANLEY D. LYMAN, Trust and Protection Officer,

Phoenix; Arizona, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Area

office, furnished the following information:

During the latter part of 1972, LYMAN was

the superintendent of the BIA located at Pine Ridge,

South Dakota, Indian Peservation. During that time,

an attack was expected from American Indian Movement

(AIM) members in an attempt to occupy the BIA building

located at Pine Ridge, South Dakota. LYMAN and DICK

WILSON, President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, formulated

the idea of creating a security guard force

to augment

the BIA police force which was understaffed. LYMAN

advised that he had more to do with the idea of creating

the security guard force and the implementation than

did WILSON.

The idea was presented to the Area and

Central Office of BIA who approved it and furnished

the authority for the implementation of the security

guard force.

LYMAN did not remember that any specific

tribal officer or body was involved regarding granting

commissions to the security guard personnel.

Applicants

for the security guard positions were tunneled through

a special police officer of the BIA police force and

when they were accepted, they were granted commissions

and placed on the BIA payroll. LYMAN did not remember

who signed the commissions, although he proferred the

possibility that he might have signed them himself.

The decision to hire each applicant was made by himself

and the Area Director:

his office as to the rule procedure to follow in the

issuance of the commissions and hiring procedure.

DICK WILSON had nothing to do with granting the commissions

although he did recommend some individuals as applicants.

These applicants, along with other applicants, were

funneled through

the special police officer of the BIA

police force prior to acceptance and being granted a

commission as a security guard.

After an applicant was accepted, he was

given

training by a BIA police officer and furnished a baton

and mace.

The security guards were not authorized to

carry guns. LYMAN remembered nothing regarding the

police officers.and it was possible that some of the

security guards could have been present during these

training sessions.

LYMAN recalled that after a number

of the applicants had been processed, that there had beer

many mixed-blooded Indians accepted and he nac

insisted on more full-blooded Indians.

LYMAN did not remember if DICK WILSON had

been issued a commission as a security guard; however,.

he, WILSON, had applied for a permit to carry a gun.

DUANE BREWER, according to LYMAN, was a member of the

BIA Police force at the time and LYMAN did .not think

that there would be any reason for BRewER to have

been issued a commission as a security guard and

doubts that BREWER had been issued such a commission.

A copy of the resolution, number 72-55 dated

November 10, 1972, of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council

of the oglala sioux Iribe signed by LLOYD Wo EAGLeBuLL,

secretary of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council and attested

to by DICK WILSON, President, Oglala Sioux Iribal Council,

• was furnished to LYMAN lor his perusal.

After reading the above-described resolution,

LYMAN stated he did not recall that the resolution had

anything to do with the implementation of the security

guard force, although he said the time would be almost

exactly right and the possibility existed that it could

commissions for the security guard force were issued.

After the threat of attack from AIM members had

died down, the security guard force was disbanded anc

LYMAN believed that this included everyone involved with

the force.

During January, 1973, another attack from

AIM members was expected

so the security guard force

was reactivated; however, control at this time of the

force was lost and discipline became a problem.

a result, the security guard force was disbanded

over a period of time and was completely defunct

by the first part of March, 1973.

LYMAN was unable to recall any specific

individuals to whom a commission for the security guard

force was granted inasmuch as his memory was rather

hazy regarding these individuals due to the passage

time.

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

This concerns a prey minary report issu

d by a "secial

Federal Grand Jury (FG..

sitting at Rapid City, Sc_ch Dakota,

concerning

its investigation of crimes on the Pine Ridge

Indian Reservation.

Attached advises that on 4/29/75, the FGJ sitting at

Rapid City returned a preliminary report concerning its

investigation of crimes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation

which, in effect, concluded that confusion exists between

the various law enforcement agencies as to who has authority

on'the reservation and that this confusion has resulted in

a duplication of effort and occasionally friction between the

different agencies.

The report acknowledged the Department of Justice is

charged with the primary responsibility for enforcing the

laws of the United States but that it is the Department of

the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs that is primarily

responsible for

law and order on the reservation.

The three-page report contained no criticism of the FBI

and recommended that the Department of Justice, or a

similarly obligated Federal agency, be delegated the law•

enforcement responsibility on reservations. It did observe

that persons living on an Indian reservation in South Dakota

are subjected to a lesser quality of life in part due to

certain degree of failure by all branches.of the Federal d

Government.

The report concluded that the FGJ intends to

further deliberate and expects to issue a final report.

THE GRAND JURY PRELIMINARY REPORT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY CRITICISM OF THE

FBI.. THE REPORT IS AS FOLLOWS:

*PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE FEDERAL GRAND JURY IN RE MATTERS AT

PINE RIDGE

"EARLIER THIS YEAR THIS GRAND JURY HEARD TESTIMONY FROM OVER

80 WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED AS TO SPECIFIC ALLEGED CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

ON THE PINE RIDGE RESERVATION. FROM THESE WITNESSES' TESTIMONY IT

HAS BECOME CLEAR TO US THAT NOT ALL AGENCIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

ARE PERFORMING THEIR LAW AND ORDER RESPONSIBILITY IN A SATISFACIORY

MANNER® BECAUSE OF OUR OATH AS GRAND JURORS WE CANNOI REVEAL SPECIFIC

TESTIMONY WHICH LEADS US TO THIS CONCLUSION; THEREFORE, WE

REFER TO SUCH TESTIMONY GENERALLY.

'IT IS APPARENT THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY CURRENTLY

•.

HANDLED BY THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED TO

PROVIDE THE NECESSARY QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF PERSONNEL,

EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER HUMAN AND PHYSICAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO

EFFECTUATE A GOOD LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ON THE RESERVATION. IN

ADDITION, WE LEARNED THAT THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS LAW ENFORCEMENT

COMMAND STRUCTURE PRECLUDES PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND

AREA SPECIAL OFFICERS FROM DIRECT AUTHORITY OR CONTROL OVER

SUBORDINATE OFFICERS. THIS CONDITION PLACES NON-LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINED

PERSONS IN COMMAND OF A MIGHLY TECHNICAL FIELD. TESTIMONY SHOWED

: *

THAI BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS SUPERINTENDENIS AND AREA DIRECTORS ARE

SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF SKILLS OTHER THAN ANY TRAINING, EXPERIENCE AND

EXPERTISE IN LAW AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THUS, THE ALLOCATION OF

PERSONNEL AND FISCAL RESOURCES IS MORE LIKELY TO REFLECT A LACK OF

FAMILIARITY WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS. IN. LIGHT OF THIS, IT

WOULD SEEM APPROPRIATE. TO PROVIDE FOR PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

OFFICIALS TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT ON INDIAN

RESERVATIONS.

• TESTIMONY ALSO DISCLOSED THAI THERE IS A CONFUSION OF

RESPONSIBILITY AS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS. THE

QUESTION OF WHETHER STATE, TRIBAL OR FEDERAL COURIS HAVE JURISDICIION

OVER A GIVEN SITUATION IS STILL NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR. IN ADDITION,

WE HAVE LEARNED THAI THE DEPARIMENI OF THE INTERIOR, WHICH IS

PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LAW AND ORDER, ALTHOUGH NOT PRIMARILY A

LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, HAS HAD TO USE THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL

SERVICE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF

INVESTIGATION, UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS, AND

ITS LITIGATIVE COMPONENTS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TO SHARE ITS LAW

ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS. THIS HAS

APPARENTLY RESULTED IN DUPLICATION OF EFFORT, CONFUSION OF

RESPONSIBILITY, AND OCCASIONALLY FRICTION BEIWEEN THE AGENCIES.

THIS CONDITION DOES NOT SERVE THE BEST INTEREST OF JUSTICE IN OUR

OPINION.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD

**

HH 55294 DocId:329896฿б

## Page 86

PAGE FOUR

RESIDE WITHIN ONE AGENCY. BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS

CHARGED WITH THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCING THE CRIMINAL

AND CIVIL LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES, AND BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT

OF INTERIOR'S BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS IS PRIMARILY, RESPONSIBLE FOR •

DELIVERING SOCIAL SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED INDIAN

TRIBES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARIMENI OF JUSTICE, OR A SIMILARLY

OBLIGATED FEDERAL AGENCY, SHOULD BE DELEGATED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

RESPONSIBILITY ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS.

'WE ARE ALSO DISMAYED TO LEARN THROUGH OUR INVESTIGATION THAT

THE TRIBAL COURT SYSTEM IS NOT ADEQUAIELY SUPPORTED BY FUNDS,

PERSONNEL, OR OTHER RESOURCES WHICH NORMALLY ARE AVAILABLE TO STATE

AND FEDERAL COURTS. THE MOST STRIKING INADEQUACY WAS THE LACK OF FUNDS

• TO HOLD JURY TRIALS WHEN TRIAL BY JURY WAS DEMANDED BY TRIBAL COURT

DEFENDANTS. THIS APPARENTLY HAS RESULTED IN A LARGE BACKLOG OF

CRIMINAL CASES AND A LONG DELAY IN BRINGING THOSE CHARGED WITH

COMMITIING CRIMINAL OFFENSES TO TRIAL.

"IT IS OUR OBSERVATION THAT PERSONS WHO LIVE ON AN INDIAN

RESERVATION IS SOUTH DANOIA, BOTH INDIAN AND NON- INDIAN, ARE SUBJECT

•TO A LESSER QUALITY OF LIFE, IN PARI DUE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE OF

FAILURE BY ALL BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

•INASMUCH AS THIS GRAND JURY HAS HEARD NUMEROUS WITNESSES AND

EXAMINED MANY EVIDENTIARY ITEMS, AND BECAUSE THE SITUATION DEMANDS

GROOMS was at his home on the evening

from the direction of the YOUNG BEAR place. CROONS also did

not take particular note of any loud automobile on the gravel

road that evening.

GROOMS has KnoWn SEVERT YOUNG BEAR since he was a

young child. Prior to 1972 GROOMS and SEVERT were good friends.

However, after YOUNG BEAR became associated with the American

Indian Movement (AIM) they have become enemies. GROOMS explained

that YOUNG BIAR leases about 400 acres of land to one NIMIZ.

NIMITZ orally agreed to allow GROOMS to take the hay off the

leased property. GROOMS had the equipment, including his baler

and two tractors, on this land. Sometime in June, 1972, all of

his equipment was impounded by members of AIM under the

direction

Of YOUNG BEAR. It was necessary for GROOMS to obtain a court

order through

the Tribal Judge in order to get his property back

and when he did he found that his equipment had been badly

vandalized. SEVERT YOUNG BEAR is very close to AIM leader

Wat EasthaN, Bureau of Indian Attairs (Bla, police,

advised that the shooting of aprit 16, 1973, at the *OrCuple

residence of ELIZABETE YOUNG BEAR SQUIRREL, COAT was investigated,

according to his beliefs, by BIA Officers LiE HARRY WESTON and

the

officer at Ryle, South Dakota.

EASTMAN KnOWS SEVERT YOUNG BEAR to be a cara-carrying

member of American Indian Movement (AIM). YOUNG BEAR has given

orders that only card-carrying members of All will be allowed on

his place.

It is strongly believed thai the YOUNG BEAR residence

is being used as a jumping off place for entry into Hounded Knee

and has been so used from the beginning of the takeover.

FASTMAN said he is of the firm belief that the shooting at the

YOUNG BEAR residence was not perpetrated by RICHARD WILSON OF

any of his so-called "goons."

WILSON is not known to perforn

any type ot covert action such as this or allow any of his

associates to perpetrate this type of action.

There is a

possibility that members of Alll could have done this operation

themselves for sone kind of cover.

There were four cartridge casings obtained at the

ELIZABETH YOUNG BEAR SQUIRREL, COAT residence which are in the

ADMINISTRATION; UNKNOWN VICTIMS

J. Stanley Pottinger, Assistant Attorney General,

CIvil Rights Division, United States Department of Justice,

Pine

Ridge, South Dakota, requested by letter dated April

14,

1973, that copies of all eviction orders issued by the Oglala

Sioux Tribal Court or by the appropriate Department of Interior

agency be obtained for the period between March 15, 1973,

and

the present as an allegation had been made that Richard Wilson,

Oglala Sioux Tribal Chairman, through Eugene Rooks, Oglala

Sioux Tribal Housing Director, and Theodore Tibbetts, Oglala

Sioux Tribal Judge, was causing eviction orders to be

issued

evicting unknown persons opposed to his administration from

Oglala Sioux tribal housing.

Sidney Witt, Oglala Sioux Tribal Prosecutor, Pine

Ridge Indian Reservation,

advised on April 18, 1973,

that he

processes all eviction notices requested by the Oglala Sioux

Tribal Housing Authority.

He stated that no eviction orders

have been issued by the Tribal Court since March 15, 1973, and

that

he could not recall any person having been evicted in the

past three or four years.

He advised it was his understanding

that the Housing Authority was planning eviction orders against

several individuals at the time of the Wounded Knee takeover but

that these requests had not been made as yet due to the turmoil

created by the takeover.

Mrs. Wynema Janis, Secretary of the Oglala Sioux

Tribal Housing Authority, Pine Ridge, advised on April 19, 1973,

that the last person to be evicted by the Tribal Housing

Authority was Ethel Rodriquez on December 31, 1972, when she

moved to Kyle on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation

where she

has been residing in a house owned by the American Legion. At

the time of her eviction, she was $435.08 in arrears in rental

payments and the apartment had been considerably damaged.

On February 6, 1973, Ethel made a payment of $200 and on April 12,

though she had vacated the apartment in December, 1972.

have had to clear her past rental debt. She stated whether or

however, did approve some of the names and these people went to

the various polls on the reservation to oversee the election.

EASIMAN advised that DAVE BREWER, a member of the Board of

Elections, might have the information pertaining to this list

He advised that absentee ballots were not utilized

in the election and that to the best of his knowledge, none

of these votes were the result of absentee ballots.

He advised that to the best of his knowledge, there

were no challenges to names appearing on the eligible voters

list. He advised that if a challenge was made to an individual

on the eligible voters list, the records of the Census Bureau,

Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Pine Ridge, South Dakota, would

be checked to see if this individual was an enrolled member of

the Oglala Sioux Tribe and had resided on the Pine Ridge Reser-

vation for at least one year.

He advised that in the primary election he did not

recall any candidates or their representatives reviewing the •

eligible voters list. He stated that in the general election,

MARIO GONZALES, who was running for Oglala Sioux Iribal Chair

man, requested

to check the registrations of all individuals

that voted so copies were made for MARIO GONZALES. He advised

that to the best of his knowledge, there were no challenges

made to have eligibles added to or ineligibles deleted from the

eligible voters list.

He stated that he does not recall that

the eligible voters list was maintained for review by interested

persons prior to the primary and general elections.

He advised that no specific training was given to

precinct voting officials on how to conduct the election;

however, they were instructed to read the Oglala Sioux Tribal

Election Ordinances. He advised there were no written in-

structions issued to election officials concerning how. the

election should be conducted but that as a general rule the

individuals utilized in the various districts were people

who had lived in these districts for many years, knew most

of the individuals in their precincts personally, and knew

what they vere doing as they had served in this capacity in

AGNES BLACK ELK nee HOLLOW HORN, who was located at her

residence in Manderson, South Dakota, was advised of the official

identities of FREDERICK COWARD, JR.

and JAMES W. DICK as Special

Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that they wanted

to interview her concerning possible violations of Federal laws

during the 1974 Oglala Sioux Tribal Elections on the Pine Ridga

Indian Reservation.

Special Agent DICK then advised BLACK ELK of

her Constitutional Rights as they appear on Form FD-395. After

reading the form BLACK ELK agreed to be interviewed by the Agents

and waived her rights by signing the form FD-395. She then furnished.

the following information:

During the primary election and general election of the

Oglala Sioux Tribe in 1974, she was the election judge of District 9,

Manderson, South Dakota. During both elections, she was at the poll,

which was located in the St. Agnes Hall, a Catholic Meeting House in

Manderson, South Dakota, from the time the poll opened at 9:00 a.m..

• until the poll closed at 7:00 p.m. At no time during these hours did

she ever leave the poll.

When people came to the poll to vote, at both the primary

and general elections, they wild give their name and BLACK ELK would .

check the name against a list of tribal members of the Manderson

District elligible to vote.

This list was provided by the Bureau of

Indian Affairs Census Office. If that persons name appeared on the

list, he or she would thén place their signature, address and date on

another sheetrof paper.

and give the ballot to the voter.

The signature was not com-

pared with any signature list to determine elligibility.

If the person's name did not appear on the census list, and

that person was. a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and had resided in

the Manderson District for a period of at least one year, BLACK ELK

would furnish the individual

an affidavit setting forth. that informa-

tion. After the person signed that affidavit, it would be returned to

BLACK ELK and the individual would also sign the signature list and

be furnished a ballot as described above.

No persons were requested by BLACK. ELK to show any identifica-

tion to verify their identity. BLACK ELK advised that she has lived in

Manderson far years and knows everyhady there.

The ballots were not numbered and there is no way, to

BLACK ELK's knowledge, that a determination could be made that a

specific ballot came from the Manderson District.

When the poll

closed, BLACK. ELK was driven by Bureau of Indian Affairs Police

Officer WAYNE ROMERO to Fine Ridge, South Dakota, where the ballot

box was turned over to the election board. The ballot box for

District 10, which was for the voting area north of Manderson,

South Dakota, was also taken to Pine Ridge by BLACK ELK.

District

10 poll was located in the same hall as District 9. After leaving

Manderson, ROMERO and BLACK ELK went to Rockyford, South Dakota,

where they picked up the ballot box there to also:take to Pine

Ridge. Enroute to Pine Ridge in Wounded Knee, South Dakota, they

picked up BILL LESSERT with the ballot box for the Wounded Knee

District. When they arrived at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, the

ballot boxes were turned. over to MOSES TWO BULLS, who gave them

their release papers.

BLACK ELK advised that the release paper

was only a small slip of paper stating that they were released

from their duty as election officials.

BLACK ELK did not have

the release paper at the time of this

interview and staied that

she did not believe it could be located. There is no way to

account for specific ballots.

At District 9, there were no äbsentee ballots given to

any voters and no requests were made for absentee ballots. No

absentee ballots were received at that poll. There were three

people who attempted to vote at the poll but advised they lived

in Rapid City, South Dakota, and due to this, BLACK ELK refused

to furnish them a ballot and they left.

The poll watchers present at District 9 were MYRTLE

JOHNSON and BERNICE WHITE HAWK, both of Manderson, South Dakota.

Both of these individuals were representing RUSSELL MEANS as

poll watchers. No individuals, to BLACK ELK's knowledge, were

prevented from being a poll watcher.

MARVIN MASTERS, voted in the general election, SANDRA

LOOKS TWICE voted in the primary and general elections, BARBARA

SWALLOW and her husband, HERB SWALLOW, both voted in the general

election.

BLACK ELK had no reason to believe that these indivi-

duals did not reside on the reservation for one year prior to

the election. She added that MASTERS, LOOKS TWICE, and HERB SWALLOW

were on the census list but BARBARA SWALLOW was not on the census

list and she submitted a signed affidavit. BLACK ELK had no knowledge

as to whether or not RICHARD WILSON OI MYRON ROCK were election

officials for the primary and general elections.

MYRON ROcK, the day

before the general elections, did deliver the ballot box and voting

materials to LAWRENCE HOLLOW HORN, who is BLACK ELK's brother.

HOLLOW HORN has been the election

judge in previous years and

according to what he told BLACK ELK, ROCK did not know that BLACK

ELK was to be the election judge for 1974. HOLLOW

I HORN took the

ballot box to the poll at Manderson, South Dakota,

on the morning

of the election. MYRON ROCK and RICHARD WILSON were not present

at the poll during the election nor did they have anything to do

with the transportation of the ballot boxes or ballots from the

poll to Pine Ridge, South Dakota.

BLACK ELK had no knowledge of

whether

either of

these individuals were involved in the counting,

of the ballots.

According to the instructions received by BLACK ELK,

there were 200 ballots delivered to District 9. During the day,

BLACK ELK gave ten ballots to District 10 because there were not

enough ballots provided to that district. To BLACK ELK's recol-

lection, approximately 148 or 149 persons voted at District 9 that

day, so she should have had approximately 40 blank ballots left at

the end of the day. She did not have time to count the blank ballots

after the poll closed, prior to going to Pine Ridge but it appeared

the stack which was left may have been in excess of 100 blank ballots.

BLACK ELK advised that she did not wish to furnish a signed

statement at this time.

At the time of the primary election, in January of 1974, he,

as the Chief Election Official of the LaCreek Precinct; was supposed to

have been furnished a voter registration list, however; this list had not

been delivered to him by the time the primary was to be conducted. As

far as the general tribal election, held on February 7, 1974, a voter re-

-i gistration list was sent but it was outdated (some of the people on the

list were deceased). WARD also stated that he had no real guidelines to

go by.

WARD also advised that when the votes were tabulated, both JOE •

POURIER and "POKER JOE" MERRIVAl, were present and also counted the votes.

WARD advised that he maintained a notebook at the polling place

and each voter signed his or her name before they recéived a ballot.

FRANK BETTLEYOUN might be under 21 years of age. He said that no proce-

aures were followed to insure that persons requesting ballots from him

were over the minimun age requirament because he has good idea of every-

one's age since he has lived in the area all his life.

RUFF advised that as a person came into the voting room, he

asked them to sign their name on the pad of paper provided by the Board,

he then checked this name against the list of eligible voters. If the

names checked okay, he then took a blank ballot, stamped it with the

official ballot stamp and then handed the ballot to the voter. The

voter would then go into the voting booth, close the curtain, and

Upon completion of voting, the voter would fold

the ballot, exit the voting booth, and drop the folded ballot into

the ballot box which was placed on the table in front of the Election

Judge.

RUFF advised that the ballots were not numbered in any

order and he did not place any number on them.

The only thing he

affixed to the ballot was the stamp "oîficial ballot."

RUFF stated

that the procedure used to account for all the ballots is as follows:

The Board of Election Iribal Office, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, sent

out in the padlocked ballot box a

• designated number of blank ballots.

The total of these ballots was written on the sheet of paper setting fort.

the contents of the locked ballot box.

RUfF, prior to the voting

counted these blank ballots and determined that the correct number

were sent.

Then, after the voting place was closed, the total of

marked ballots were counted and the remaining unmarked ballots were

counted.

The total of these two counts were added and checked with

the total of ballots sent out by the Board of Election.

RUF? stated

that there were no errors in his ballot counts and his

District ac-

counted for all the ballots sent by the Board of election.

RUFF advised that no form of identification is required of

the voter when they appear at the voting place. RUFF stated that

VERVIE TALLMAN and he,

being long time residents of the Pine Ridge

Indian Reservation and the Pass Creek voting district, know all the

residents and eligible voters and if they are of legal voting age.

He advised that at no time was the identification question of the

voters questioned except in one incident. This person is the hus-

band of JOY MArSHAl's daughter and resides in the housing project

RUFF advised there were no requests for absentee ballots

and, in fact, there were no absentee ballots in his district during

this most recent election.. He stated he received no absentee ballots

of any sort.

He advised that in view of the fact they received no

absentee ballots,

, there were no procedures in distinguishing absentee

ballots from the other ballots,

Therefore, there was no separate

ballot boxes for voting and all ballots were placed in only one

ballot box, the box provided by the Election Board.

RUFF advised that the procedure of collecting absentee

ballots did not exist in his district this elaction as there were

no absentee ballots.

RUFF advised that at the completion of the election and the

count of the ballots, all the voting material is placed into the ballot

box along with the key to the padlock.

The box is then closed, pad-

locked, and picked up by the police.

RuFf stated that he received a

telephone call Irom DAVe BRETER who advised him that if the police

car did not arrive to pick up the ballot box on Election night he was

to bring it in to his, BREWER's, office the next morning. RUFF ad-

vised that after the counting of the ballots, the recording of same

and the calling in of the results of the voting, he secured the box

and awaited the arrival of the police car.

When the police car did

not arrive, he took the ballot box to his residence and then delivered

the box to

DAVE BREWER's office the next moming-

RUFF stated that in those instances where a voter's name

did not appear on the eligible voters list and they were allowed to

vote aîter they prepared a Residency Affidavit. This is a printed.

form which the person fills out attesting in front of the Election

Jidge and the Election Clerk that they are a resident of the voting

district for one year, their residence, and that they are of the

legal voting age, which, according to RUFF, is twenty-one years of

RUFF stated that these affidavits are placed in the ballot box

at the completion of the election and returned to the Board of Election

Office. He stated that it is then the responsibility of the Board of

Election to see that the name on the affidavit is then added to the

eligible voters list for the next election.

RUFF advised that he has no knowledge of any official or

unofficial poll watcher at his polling place.

RUFF advised that at

about 8:30 in the morning of election day a young male Indian came

into the polling place and remained in the corner all day long. This

man was about thirty years old, six feet tall, slim build, dressed

well. RUFF stated this man made no comments about the election pro-

cedures, made no challenges and after the counting of the ballots

were complete and the ballot box locked, this man left the polling

area. RUFF stated he did not know this man and later learned his

name was IRON CLOUD; however, his first name was unknown to him.

RUFF advised that no person was prevented from being a poll watcher

by either VERNIE TALLMAN or himself and, in fact, they did not have

any poll watchers unless the male Indian, IRON CLOUD, who remained

inside the polling place all day was a poll watcher.

RUFF. stated he is not acquainted with an ALVIN IRON CLOUD

and that such a person did not vote in his district. RUFF stated

that he cannot state if ALVIN IRON CLOUD is in fact the same IRON

CLOUD that sat in the polling place all day.

RUFF concluded that last Wednesday, March 20, 1974, a

young man came to him and asked almost the identical questions as

have the interviewing Agents

RUFF stated this man was a young Indian male, about thirty

years oi age, five leet nine inches tall, 140-150 pounds, slender

build, dark complexion.

Ruft stated that he was driving a car with

a Pennington County,

South Dakota

(2 - balance unknown) license

plate.

This man told RUFF the White House had sent him to the

Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to ask these questions about the

recent election. The only questions that RUFF could recall this

young man asking were the number of ballots sent out and if it

was a fair election, RUEF stated he has never seen this man before.

STOMLEY advised those individuals above who have not been

the use of a name other than the original Indian family name.

She

said it is a fairly common practice of Indians to shorten their last

without benefit of the full given name.

NOW COMES Robert keith, on this 15th day of February, 1974,

and on his own personal behalf, and on behalf of Fussell Means and

all other officially enrolled members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe

on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, hereby files with the Board

of Elections appointed by the elected Tribal Council of

the Oglala

•Sioux, pursuant to Section 12 of the Oglala Iribal Council Ordinance

• No. 85 (G) governing the

February 7, 1974 Tribal Elections, this

formal contest to acceptance by the Tribal Council of the results

of the February 7, 1974 Tribal Elections as "certified" by the

Board of Elections on Wednesday, February 13, 1974.

As grounds for said challenge, Hobart Keith sets the following

facts before the Board of Elections:

(a) That I am an officially enrolled member of the Oglala

SIoux Tribe;

(b) That I am an official resident of the Pine Ridge Indian

Reservation, and that I have been such an official resident

of this Reservation prior to, and inclusive of, the full

one-year perioà required to be an officially qualified voter

In the February 7, 1974 election, in accordance with the

requirements

set forth in Ordinance No: 85 (G) of

the

Tribal Council of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge

Indian Reservation.

(d) That I, as well as my Indian brothers and sisters

who were officially cualified to vote in the Tribal

Election of February 7, 1974, have been deprived of our

right to have our expressed desires accurately recorded

and reflected by the "certified" results of the February

7, 1974 Tribal Election supervised by the Board of Election

appointed by the Tribal Council pursuant to Ordinance.

No: 85 (G) of the Tribal Council of the Oglala Sioux Tribe

(e) That more specifically;

• (1) At the Eagle Nest District Polling Place, Wanblee,

over 20 persons entered the polling place, were given voting

ballots for the February 7, 1974 Tribal Election by James

Charging Crow or by Leroy Battleyoun, entered the voting

booth, marked the ballots and then placed their ballots in

the

Eagle Nest ballot box without ever having been certified as

having been listed on the official voter registration 115ü.

In fact, none of the over 20 persons were listed on the

official registered voter list, and none of them were

verified as qualified to vote before being allowed to vote

by James Charging Crow or Leroy Battleyoun. Thus, the

officials appointed by the Board of Election to supervise the

the February 7, 1974 Tribal Election at. that Polling Place

reportea

to the Board of Electión that 132 votes had, been

cast in

the district for one of the candidates for Tribal

Chairman, whereas, in fact, only 122 votes haa been reflected

by the ballots

cast for that candidate in the Eagle Nest

District: such misconduct constitutes a violation of

Section 10 of Ordinance No. 85 (G) passed by the Pine Ridge

Tribal Council to govern the February 7, 1974 Tribal Election;

(4) Other persons who voted in the february 7, 1974

Iribal Election at the Bagle Nest District Polling Place

ballot box at

the Potato Creek District Polling Place.

When the officials

appointed by the Board of Elections to supervise the Potato

•Creek District Polling Place were asked why

there

over 80 ballots in the official ballot box when there were

so few qualified voters in that district, they laughed and

said that there must have been a population explosion between

the date for official registration and election day

Thus,

the officials appointed by the Board of Elections to

supervise the February 7, 1974 Tribal Election at the Potato

Creek District Polling Place on the Pine Ridge Indian

Reservation refused to enforce Section 2(c). of Ordinance No.

85 (G). passed by the Oglala Tribal Council to govern the

February 7, 1974 Iribal Election;

16) At the Manderson District Polling Place, numerous

persons voted more than once, placing separate marked voting

ballots in each of the two ballot boxes.

Numerous persons who

did

not reside on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation

were

given official voting ballots by officials appointed by the

•Board of Elections. These persons marked the ballots and

placed them in the official ballot boxes located at the

Manderson District Polling Place, despite the fact that said

persons were not officially qualified to vote according to

the qualifications set forth in Ordinance No. 85 (G) of the

Pine Ridge Tribal Council. Some of these persons were Marvin

Masters, Sandra Looks Iwice, Barbara Swallow and her husband.

All of these persons resided in Rapid City and not on the

Pine Ridge Indian Reservation as required by Ordinance No.

85 (G) and they resided off the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation

for over a full year prior to the February 7, 1974 Tribal

Election. Thus, the officials appointed by the Board of

supervise the February T, 1974 Iribal Election explicitly

ordered one Richard I. Little, an official candidate

official ballots were sent to the officials appointed to

Place.

However, only 51 ballots were returned at

the end of

Election Day. Moreover, the records of this. Polling Place

reveal that only 44 persons voted at this location on

Election Day, whereas more than this number of marked ballots

were counted-by the Board of Election as having been cast

from this Polling Place. The registering by the Board of

Election of more votes from Red Shirt Table than the records

of that Polling Place show were cast constitutes a violation

of Section 10 of Ordinance No. 85 (G) passed by the Tribal

Council to govern the conduct of the Iribal. Election;

(20) On the

evening of February 7, 1974, Richard Wilson,

a candidate for Tribal Chairman, was physically present inside

the office to which the official ballot boxes were delivered

from the various official Polling Places on the Pine Ridge

Indian Reservation. In this office, a number of these

official ballot boxes

were opened

on the evening of February

7, 1974, and numerous official ballots were removed from these

ballot boxes directly in the presence of Richard Wilson.

(f) That Prior to the February 7, 1974 Iribal Election, and

subsequent to this election, overt threats, including threats of

physical violence, have been made against the lives and property

of numerous persons

who refused to express their affirmative

support for

the reelection of Candidate Wilson in the Tribal

Elections. These threats constitute overt violations

of the Indian

and they have had an illegal effect on

T, 1974, the

results of which were

"certified" and announced by the Board of

Elections appointed by the Tribal Council on Tuesday afternoon,

February 13, 1974, 1s filed pursuant to Section 12öf Ordinance

No. 85 (G) passed by the Oglala Sioux Iribal Council

to govern

the conduct of said Iribal Election;

• (1) • This formal contest sets forth numerous specific violations

of particular provisions of Ordinance No. 85 (G) passed by the

Tribal Council to govern the conduct of the February 7, 197,4 Tribal

Election. Copies of formal affidavits, signed by enrolled members

of the Oglala Sioux Iribe, evidencing the truth of each specified

violation, are

attached to this formal

contest. While ail of these

affidavits have not, as yet, been notarized by licensed Notary

Publics, due to the brevity of time available to file this contest

under the provision of. Ordinance No. 85 (G), preparation of such

formal affidavits, which will be admissible in a Court of Law are

presently being prepared.

violations of most fundamental provisions of Ordinance-No. 85 (G)

passed by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council to govern the conduct

of the February 7, 1974 Tribal Election on the Pine Ridge Indian

Reservation. Fundamental violations of the provisions of

Oxdinance No. 85 (G) are evidenced herein to have been committed

of Pine Ridge Village; the District of Pass Creek; the District of

Medicine Root (Kyle Village); the District of White Clay (Red Shirt

Table): the LaCreek District; the Eagle Nest District; and the

District of Wounded Knee (Manderson).

These violations range

from the total refusal of officials at Polling Places to under-

take any effort whatsoever to enforce Section 2 (a) of Ordinance

No. 85 (G) setting forth the qualifications for voters, to the

unsupervised collection of open ballots hy active supporters of

particular candidates from persons throughout the Election District

Head Start Program, Pine Ridge Agency South Dakota, was contacted

at her employment.

JACOBS was advised of the official nature

Of SA LARRY IN. DE WITT'S contact with: JACOBS.

Upon questioning JACOBS advised as follows:

In regard to the debit in the amount: of $14, 583.00

on September 6, 1972, from the account of the OST Head Start

Program and which account is maintained ac the First National

Bank of Gordon, Nebraska, account number 0125873, JACOBS advised

that the Parent Child Center as well as the Head Start Programs

funds were obtained from a tribal grant received from Health

Education and Welfare, Washington, D.C. In 1972, the funding

for both of these programs was received by this same letter of

credit.

The $37,718.00 which was received by US Treasury

payment voucher 72-15 letter of credit number 75-01-9701 and

which was deposited in the account of the Head Start Program

OST at First National Bank Gordon, Nebraska, on August 31, 1972.

actually contained the funding fron both the Head Start and

the Parent Child Centifar Program.

It was therefore necessary to transfer $14, 583.00,

the amount for the Parent Child Center Progiam from

• the Head

Start Program into the other account.

JACOBS advised that there was nothing unusual in regard

to the above transfer of $14, 583.00 from the Head Start Program

since is was customaty to transfer this months since the funding

for both programs came by the same letter of credit.

JACOBS was of the impression that CARMEL MEANS formerly

handled the Parent Child Center funds at which time MEANS offica

was located at the Pine Ridge Airport. This proglam is now handled

GERALDINE MAD JANIS, Box 44, Pine Ridge (telephone

867-5356), who is the Community Health Representative for the

information:

In 1968 and 1969, DICK WILSON was a representative

jor the sloux Tribe and was in charge of the sun bance

coremony.

This is a caremony wherein the tribe puts up

$6000 in

order

to promota the annual Sioux Sun Dance Ceremony.

In WILSON's capacity as chairman of the Sun Dance

ceremony, he received $6000 from the tribe in order to

pronote

the ceremony but the ceremony never actually took

place while WILSON was chairman.

There was an investigation

into the embezzlement of these funds about to years ago and

as a result of the investigation, one of MILSON's goon

squad" members named ROBERT MOUSSEAU was found guilty

of embezzling a portion of the lünds which were designated

for the Sun 'Dance Ceremony.

MOUSSEAU raportedly took the:

entire rap for WILSON in this matter.

The individual who has more information concering

the misapprppriation of funds of the Sun Dance Ceremony fund

Is GERALD ONE FEATHER, who was Tribal Chief during that time.

An individual who works at the Sioux Tribal

headquarters, whose identity danis cannot recall at this time,

advised her that WILSON paid his brother;

, OIN WILSON, $15,000

for consulting fee.

To the best of her Inowledge, JIM Wilsor

has done nothing to earn this money.

BOB ECOrEX, Planning Director for the Reservation,

works at the oro Office located at the pina Ridge Aliport and

is WILSON's man inside the 0F0 who delegates WILSON's

orders and alchéi:!".

LELAND BEARRELLA, OEO Director, is extremely scared of

WILSON and since he was appointed

in his

position by the triba

which WILSON runs, he (BEARHELS) does whatever WILSoN wishes

him to da.

GERALD ONE LEATHER, GiaLa SIOUX IrIbal Chiet

prior to RICHARD WILSON, Box 298, Oglala, South Dakota

(telephine 867-5327), provided the following information:

Since RICHARD WILSON became president of the

Oglala Sioux Tribe in January, 1972, ONE FEATHER has been

working with both the American

Indian Movement (AIM) and

the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council in an effort to improve

the criminal justice system and the financial status of

the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

ONEFEATHER suspects Chairman WILSON of many

wrong doings since becoming chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribe,

but he has no direct proof or evidence which could be

used against WILSON in a court of law.

Since WILSON

became president, he has

suspended and fired many

competent people who were associated with the Tribal

Council because these people would not cooperate with

WILSON in carrying out various "deals" which WILSON was

trying to do.

WILSON suspenced the Office of Economic Opportunity

(OBO) Headstart Director BAITIE THISS, because she would

not cooperate with WILSON concerning the payment of approxi-

mately ten to fifteen thousand dollars to WILSON's brother,

JAMES J.

Wilwon, -for some type of consulting fees he

received through the headstart program.

TwISS can be

located

at the hospital in Gordon, Nebraska.

WILSON is involved with a contractor in Rapid

City, South Dakota named JERRY GLAZE. WILSON has been

giving all construction contracts on the Pine Ridge Reservation

to Glaze and not allowing Indian labor to be utilized in

various construction projects currently underway on the

reservation.

GLAZE supposedly gave WILSON $10,000 to

assist him (WILSON) in winning the Oglala Sioux Tribal

presidential election in 1971-1972.

An individual named CARROL SWAN who has an

office next door to the Northwest Engineering Company in

Rapid City and whose telephone number is 348-1090, has

information concerning heavy equipment which belongs to

the Oglala Sioux Tribe that WILSON sold and then used

the proceeds from this sale for his personal use.

Since WILSON took ofíice in January, 1972,

the books and records for the Oglala Sioux Tribe have

not been audited and according to several members of

the Tribal Council the records which are currently

being kept are very inadequate.

During the ONE FEATHER administration, the

accounting firm of Thornton and Saylor in Rapid City

was responsible for auditing the books and records of

the Oglala sioux Tribe.

Also, an accountant named

FRANCES KILLER who lives in Vermillion, South Dakota

and whose telephone number is 642-4963, was under a

contract with the Tribe to do monthly accounting work

for the Tribe. KIlLERs contract with the Tribe ex-

pired in October, 1972 and WILSON would not renew

his contract.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently

conducted an audit of the Oglala Sioux Tribe records.

The results and findings of this audit were to be

reported to Senator HENRY JACKSON of Washington State

stability of the Oglala

Bank has various

loans and checking accounts for the

Tribe.

Concerning WILSON's involvement in the embezzle-

ment of Tribal funds from the Sundance Ceremony in 1969,

ONE FEATHER provided a xerox copy of a Federal Grand Jury,

District of south Dakota, Western Division, indictment of

ROBERT MOUSSEAU and RICHARD WILSON.

MOUSS EAU was con-

victed on the charges of embezzling Tribal funds but the

charges against WILSON were dismissed.

ONE FEATHER does

not know why the charges against WILSON were dismissed.

He feels that WILSON paid MOUSSEAU to take the rap for him.

C. H. KEITH, who lives in the East Ridge subdivision in

has information concerning the misuse of lunds

Tribe in that WILSON sold building materials which had been

purchased with government funds and thereafter converted

the proceeds from the sale of these building materials to

his own personal use.

ONE FEATHER provided a Linancial statement of

the Oglala Sioux Tribe as of April 12, 1972, which re-

flected the results of an audit of the Oglala Sioux

the predication for the audit of April 12, 1972.

ONE FEATHER advised that if he can be of any

further assistance to the FBI he will be more than

willing to cooperate.

DICK WILSON, POSt O ViSON, 53, er te Tri, 1 Crase, provided

the following information:

About three years ago, his brother, DICK WILSON, received

a Government grant to start a contracting business. At the same

he needed to operate the business.

GEORGE took the grant money

which DICK gave him and borrowed additional funds from the First

National Bank of Gordon, Nebraska.

With this money, he (GEORGE)

purchased a two-ton Chevrolet truck from Coons Chevrolet in :

Martin, South Dakota, and a back hoe and low boy from an unrecalled

equipment company in

Cheyenne, Wyoming.

GEORGE WILSON has all

cancelled checks and documents surrounding this transaction;

however, the records are boxed up as he is in the process of

moving.

He will make these records available to the FBI upon

request.

About the latter part of 1971, GEORGE WILSON's health

DICK WILSON took over the business and

after a short time and as a

result of a contract where the business accumulated many repair

bills from the back hoe, the business went broke.

At about this

First National Bank that the equipment was for sale. DICK WILSON

told GEORGE WILSON that Barton Construction wanted to purchase the

equipment. GEORGE contacted a representative of Barton and they

made a deal for Barton to purchase the equipment. GEORGE WILSON

and the representative from Barton Construction in Rapid City..

South Dakota, went to the First National Bank of Gordon where WILSON

signed over the equipment to Barton and Barton paid off the loan on

the equipment.

JEROME M. GLAZE, 3925 Canyon Lake Road, Rapid City,

South Dakota, telephone number 342-5823, was interviewed by

Bureau Agents

at his residence.

He was advised of the identities

of the interviewing Agents by display of their FBI credentials.

He was advised that the FBI wished to question him concerning the

possible sale of heavy equipment to the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the

Pine Ridge Indian Reservation by Tribal Chairman DICK WILSON

wherein WILSON kept the proceeds for his own personal use and

GLAZE's possible involvement in this sale. GLAZE was advised

of his rights as stated on the Interrogation; Advice of Rights

Form which he signed and thereby waived his rights.

GLAZE is a sales representative for the Dakota Leasing

Company In Rapid City, South Dakota.

Dakota Leasing does contracting

work on the reservation as well as other independent contracting

jobs. Dakota Leasing bids for contracts through competitive bids

which are advertised

in the newspaper.

If Dakota Leasing is awarded

a contract, they then subcontract the work to various subcontractors

in the Rapid City area.

• GLAZE hasknown DICK WILSON for five or six years and they

are friends.

Just before WILSON was to be inaugurated as Chairman

of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, WILSON called GLAZE and told him that he

was in trouble and needed

some help.

First National Bank of Gordon,

Nebraska, was in the process of

foreclosing on a loan for equipment which he had purchased from

an equipment company in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the Chevrolet

dealership in Martin, South Dakota.

The equipment was a back hoe,

GLAZE told WILSON that

GLAZE contacted ERNIE BARTON at Barton Masonry in Rapid

City. BARTON told GLAZE if WILSON would bring the equipment to

Rapid City for BARTON to inspect, he (BARTON) would consider

purchasing the equipment.

WILSON brought the equipment to Rapid

City and left it at BARTON's equipment yard. BARTON thereafter

decided to buy the equipment. BARTON went to the First National

Bank in Gordon, Nebraska, and paid off the loan on the equipment.

The equipment was then titled over to BARTON.

GEORGE WILSON was involved in this equipment deal

but GLAZE is not sure to what extent. He believes that the

equipment was in GEORGE WILSON's name and that the loan at the

First National Bank was also in GEORGE WILSON's name.

GLAZE has never received any money from the Oglala

Sioux Tribe or from DICK WILSON.

The only money he receives

as a result of any work done for the Tribe is in the form of

commissions paid to him as a sales representative of the Dakota

Leasing Company.

He located the buyer for the equipment which

DICK WILSON had

as a personal favor to DICK WILSON.

did assist him in the conduct of the election campaign by talking

with various ranchers who live on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation,

South Dakota, and having them donate beef for

'pow wows" held on

the reservation to help elect WILsoN.

GLAZE has no knowledge of money being paid to DICK's

brother, JIM WILSON, for any type of consulting fees.

DICK WILSON is the best tribal chairman the tribe has

had in many years.

DICK WILSON is not corrupt and is working for

the benefit of the tribe.

3. Land Acquisition Enterpiise - this fund

purchases land within the bouidarios ai the Pine Ridge

Reservation.

The last audit conducted on the aforementioned-

throe funds was in June, 1972. The findings of all prior

audits of these

lunds has always resulted in either a

qualified or a disclaimer of opinion for the audit.

The

primary reason shat all the audits have been qualified

anä/or disclaimer

opinions is because of the

tardiness

of the recorakeeping or the above three lunds. however,

a Lull-scale audit has always been conducted and in this

capacity, the auditing standards and procedures which have

been utilizad would have uncovered any misappropriation,

Iraud or embezzlement which might have been taking place

in these funds.

OST Chairman DICK WILSON has no control or for

of the nature of these lunds and the checks and balances

which are placed upon these funds, it is not likely that

any irregularities might occur in

state unemployment

tax reports and pay the taxes which were withheld from

the employee's salary fron the

monies,

which is given

to them by OED from

the specified special project fund.

The Sioux Tribal Headquarters has not been filing these

tax reports.

About one year ago, the Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) came to Pine Ridge and audited the various

small projects on which the tribe

was supposed to tile

payroll tax reports.

The IRS audit resulted in

the CA?

fund having to pay several thousand dollars in back roll

taxes for these various special projects which the tribe

had failed to file

payroll tax reports lor.

The tribe

received the money from the CAP lund to pay

these taxes

but did not do so.

The special projects heretofore referred

to

#he rein OEO submitted monies to the tribe for salaries

plus withholding tax are

the "Community Action Program",

"Parent-Child Center"

', and "Headstart."

Beginning March 27, 1973, the day WILSON'a

set up a roadblock to prevent food

from entering Wouid

Knee, several of WILSON's men began signing charge licrets

at the Sioux Nation Shopping Center for groceries to Ire

used by WILSON's "goon squad" at the roadblock.

The ae

charge tickets are to be paid out of the OBO "Emergerc?

Food and Medical Services Fund" (EFMSF). The persons who

have signed for groceries and charged them to the ernsr

but who are not authorized by OEO to do so are:

I) ANTHONY BRAVE; 2) DELORES APPLE; 3) TIM SHANGRESS:

These three persons should not be spending money out of

the EEMSF account.

The total amount expended for groceztes

on March 27, 28 and 29, 1973, by the above-mentioned persons

is $127.19. None of these people work for OED.

The original documents pertaining to the afcrementioned

AIM support of impeachment of President of Oglala

"RICHARD WILSON receives direct support from the

Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of Interior and

AIM has made its goal and objective to oust the BIA from

interfering with tribal business,

with governing tribal

business, running our business,

dictating.

This is what the

presidency of the Oglala sioux is doing right now. He's

dictating policy, he's didating procedures, laws, he has

total disregard

Ior civil rights or treaty rights. As a

result of that we have taken a direct stand to oppose the

Bureau of Indian Affairs in their puppet Government on the

Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. I tnink that the Pine Ridge

Reservation, the people there, are very much dissatistied with

the puppet Government, the colonialistic Government that the

SIA has set up out there, and I think one of the reasons, of

course,

'that they have decided to call AlM for support Is

that they are being neglected, even by the tribal president.

Our stand will continue against the Government to oust them

from Indian attairs.

Future plans of ALM to BLA:

"AlM is going to Increase its activity against the

Government. Were going to increase our stand against colunlalistic

Governments, we're going to increase our opposition to any of their

puppet dictators from coming to the reservation. I think that

this is primarily an area where the people in the east do not

understand how the tribal Governments work,

that they're set up

by the Governmert and they are dictating policy.

Just recently

Sioux became very angry at this type of system and they voted

to challenge the districting of the Government in trying to

eliminate a lot of grass roots Indians, a lot of full-blood

Indians from the tribal council, and so the Cheyenne River Sioux

voted within themselves to challenge it and they won, and now

you have the Cheyenne River Tribal Council composed of at least

more than 75% of its members who are grass roots Indians, who are

full-bloods, and who are now going to try and dictate back to the

Government how they want this system to operate, and the Government

is very upset that the Cheyenne

River Sioux took this stand and

of course, they did everything in its power to try and discredit

On February 14, 1973, source advised he had determined

that a caravan of about 340 people drove to Sturgis,

South Dakota,

to attend the hearing of HAROLD WHITE HORSE.

When the caravan

arrived at the courthouse, they found that the building had

been blockaded with snowplows and elements of the South Dakota

State Patrol were present.

Discussions followed and about four or five American

Indian Movement (AIM) spokesmen were permitted inside the

some he she newes

These included DENNIS BANKS, RUSSELL MEANS and

some of the news media. At this point a judge asked for the

identities of the news media representatives and upon

not identifying themselves;

the judge ordered the press outside

the courthouse,

stating that they exaggerate, cause ill feelings

and increase bitterness.

The source determined that bond for WHITE HORSE

was reduced to $15,000 and that AIM considered it to be a

successful operation.

After the hearing, the caravan returned to Rapid

City, South Dakota,

where about 40 Indians were being "tried"

concerning distruction of taverns which had occurred on an

earlier date. Following this trial, source determined that

approximately one half of the Indian cases were dismissed

and the remainder of the persons were put on probation to

Indians.

Meetings were held in Rapid City, South Dakota,

on February 12, 1973, which concerned, in part, attempts

to get

the American Indian Movement commission to operate.

Rapid

City spokesman noted that AIM demands could be met if no more

Indians arrived in town and if the non-local Indians left town.

DENNIS BANKS stated that under no conditions would AIM

be intimidated either as a group or on an individual

basis. He stated that "We are staying."

On February 13, 1973, the Indian caravan started for the

Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to attend impeach-

ment proceedings against RICHARD/WILSON, Chairman of the Oglala

Sioux Tribe.

WILSON is described, as an

arch enemy of the

American Indian Movementa. The source advised that WILSON is

being impeached by the tribal council who had invited the

American Indian Movement to witness the proceedings. WILSON

is reported to have stated that with respect to AIM that

he will "shoot 'em on sight."

Following the impeachment

proceedings, AIM was to be given a buffalo by the tribal

council for there use in thier upcoming victory dance.

a Chicano, who is active at Scottsbluff, Nebraska,

and Rapid

city, South Dakota.

He stated that he would meet MARTINEZ

at Lincoln, Nebraska, on February 21, 1973.

Source added that AIM

l intends to impeach RICHARD WILSON

from his job as the Tribal Council President after which he

will probably be murdered. He advised that WILSON would not

be harmed prior to impeachment as AIM would not have the

sympathy of the other Indians on the reservation.

Source stated two cases of guns had arrived at a

small landing field near Steamboat Rock and DeValley. northwest

of Rapid City, South Dakota. He did not know what became of the

guns or who paid for them.

2. Sometime in the late summer or fall of 1974 1 was asked

by the Wounded Knee Legal Defense/Offense Committee (WKLDOC

hereinafter) whether I would be willing to represent a defendant

in one of the many cases then pending in the State and

Federal

Courts growing out of the events which occurred at Wounded Knee

on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the winter and spring

of 1973. My name had come to WKLDOC as a lawyer with considera

able civil trial experience who occasionally undertook cases

in the public interest and as one who could

afford from time to

time to take such cases without fee. I told the Committee that

I would be willing to take such a case, provided that its timing

would fit into my schedule. Prior to this time, and other than

in connection with the events to be recited herein, I have had

no connection with or involvement with WKLDOC or with the

American Indian Movement (AIM hereinafter).

• 3. Early in Februacy 1975 I received a call from WKLDOC

saying that they had a case which was scheduled to come to trial

on March 3, 1975.

They asked if I would be available to try

this case and I said that I would. The case turned out to be

Escamilla is charged under indictment, in

so far as is

pertinent to the events, herein, with taking at gunpoint a pocket

knife, a watch valued at approximately $30 and $5 cash from one

Charles Merrillon March 11, 1973 at Wounded Knee, South Dakota

on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. While the case is docketed

in the South Dakota District, it was scheduled to be tried,

because of

a prior change

of venue, at the United States Court

House in Council Bluffs, Iowa. However, pre-trial motions were

scheduled for Thursday, February 27, 1975 in Rapid City, South

Dakota before Judge Andrew W. Bogue.

4. In order to prepare for the trial scheduled for March 3, 1975

and the motion scheduled for February 27, 1975 I went out to

Council Bluffs on Monday, February 24, 1975 to meet with the

resident attorney. and legal workers who had been doing backround

work on all of the cases resulting from: the Wounded Knee events

of two years earlier and also to meet my prospective client,

the defendant Mr. Escamilla. In Council Bluffs I spent two

days of intensive work with Martha Copleman, a member of the.

New Jersey Bar and with Katherine James, a

legal worker, both

of whom had done a great amount of preliminary preparation for

the Escamilla case as well as other "Wounded Knee" cases. I

also met with Mr. Escamilla for the first time. I determined

that in

order adequately to prepare for trial it would be highly

advisable for me to visit the scene of the alleged events at

Wounded Knee and also to have further investigative work done

• on the Pine Ridge Reservation. I was told by Ms. Copleman

and Ms. James that a lawyer and a legal worker were available

on the Reservation

to do this investigative work. I happen

• also to be a

pilot holding a commercial pilot license and

accordingly determined to rent a plane at Council Bluffs on

Wednesday, February 26 and fly up to Rapid City with the defen-

dant and Ms. Copleman and Ms. James, with a stop at Pine Ridge

which has an airport on the way from Council Bluffs to Rapid

City where we would meet with the local attorney and legal

worker and view the scene of the events at Wounded Knee.

5. Accordingly on Wednesday, February 26, 1975 I rented a

Cherokee Six Exom James Niebur, the owner or managet of the

fixed 'base operator at the Council Bluffs Airport. We took

off from Council Bluffs at 10:50. A.M. Central Daylight Time

that morning and after stopping for fuel at Ainsworth, Nebraska

landed at Pine Ridge at approximately 1:45 to 1:50 P.M. Mountain

Daylight Time. There we were met by Roger Finzel who I under-

stood is a member of the Bars of Washington, D.C. and South

Dakota

and Eda Gordon, a legal worker, both of whom I under-

stood were working on the Pine Ridge Reservation on behalf

of WKLDOC.

were alleged to have occurred.

Ms. Gordon rejoined us at

Wounded Knee and the six of us then drove back in Mi. Finzel's

When we arrived there we found that the airplane which

I had

rented was riddled with bullet holes. I made a hurried inspec

tion of the airplane and. found multiple holes in the windows

on the right side and marks on the right wings and fuel tanks

located therein. I decided that the airplane should not be .

flown until its air worthiness was determined by a competent

certified aviaton mechanic. Accordingly we loaded our baggage

Including numerous legal files which we had brought along for

preparation of the pre-trial motion scheduled the next day

in Rapid City, into MI. Finzel's car with the intention of firsi

reporting the damage to the airplane to the local police in

person and to Mr. Niebur by telephone and then driving to Rapid

City. The car was an Oldsmobile convertible, two door, approxi.

mately nine or ten years old. Mr. Finzel was in the driver'

seat, I was in the right front and between

us was Ms. Gordon.

Immediately behind me was MI. Escamilla, with Ms. Copleman

in the left rear and Ms. James in the middle.

We

started to drive out of the airport but before reaching the

road (which I believe runs from Pine Ridge toward Wounded

Knee) where we intended to make a left turn toward Pine Ridge,

our way was suddenly blocked by a car which pulled up in front

of us. At the same moment ten or fifteen other cars pulled

into the airport entirely blocking us on all sides. It being

very cold our windows were closed and as the car which immediater

Iy blocked us came to a stop I saw a man get on the front hood,

facing us and pointing a shotgun at us. Mr. Finzel said to

lock the car which we did and we were

approached on both sides

by several men. Almost imnediately there was a crowd of about

thirty men around us. One of the first men to emerge from the

cars which had pulled up was a man identified to me by, and

known to, all of the other occupants of our car, as Richard

Wilson, the Tribal Chairman of the Tribal Government on the

Pine Ridge Reservation whom I recognized from pictures of him

which I had seen in a publication entitled "Voices from Wounded

Knee 1973" published in 1974 by AKWESASNE NOTES, Mohawk Nation,

via Rooseveltown, New York 13683, ISBN 0-914838-01-6,

Library of Congress Catalog Number 74-82402. The men who came

up to the left

side of the car shouted "open up". Mr. Finzel

asked them what they wanted. They said they wanted to talk.

Mr. Finzel said "you can talk through the closed door and I

can hear you". At this moment at least two men started slashing

through the toof of the convertible with knives and in a very

Eew seconds ripped off the entire roof of the car. As that

happened I unlocked the door on my side and I believe Mr. Finzel

did the same on his side. The men on the front of the car on

the left side

then said to Finzel that he had been involved

in some incident at the court house in Pine Ridge (which I

later learned had taken place at the very time that we were

at Wounded Knee some 17 miles distant). Finzel said "you can

ask Dick Wilson, he knows I wasn't there". At this point

Wilson came over and Finzel said to him words to the effect

"you know I wasn't at the court house today". Wilson did not

reply to Finzel but said to the men next to him "stomp on hin".

ed in the windshield and at least two men got on the back of

the car and kicked in the back window. The men up front started

to kick Finzel in the head. Ms. Gordon tried to protect Finzel

and she also was kicked in the head. The men on the left tried

to drag Finzel out of the car through the left side and were

unable to do so and then they and/or others pulled at him from

the right and in the course of this I was forced out of the

car and hit and kicked. When the events started I had a legal

case

In my hand and this was still in my hand when I got out

of the car. I started to walk toward the rear of the car and

saw Wilson at the same time. that I was being

shoved, hit, kicked

and pushed by another man. I called to Wilson, "are you in

charge here?" hoping to tell him that I was a lawyer doing work

In connection with a case and to prevail upon him to stop the

violence. Wilson did not reply but made a motion to the man

who had been shoving me, upon which the man kicked and hit me

again and knocked me into a ditch

at the rear of the car which

was covered

partly with mud and partly with ice. This man

said "you wait over there and they'll get you later"'. When I

got up from being knocked into the ditch I saw M.. Escamilla

on

the ground on the right side of the car being kicked by several

men. After several minutes more during which time Mi. Escamilla

and Me. Finzel' continued to be beaten a somewhat older man,

can'Indian, motioned Mr. Finzel:: and Mr. Escamilla to get back

into the car and I came back across the ditch and was allowed

to get in. Mr. Finzel:. was too injured to drive and Mr.

Escamilla got into the drivers seat. The car: which had been

blocking us moved out of the way and we were allowed to

leave

the scene.

As we left we heard shouts of "get off the reservar

tion" and "don't you ever come back". Mr. Escamilla drove and

we left the Reservation as fast as we could. Because of the cold.

we could not drive the totally open car all the way to Rapid

City and we eventually stopped at a place which is unknown to

me where the others arranged to get two other cars with

drivers who drove us to the Rapid City Regional Hospital in

Rapid City where we arrived at approximately 10:00 P.M. local

time.

While still in Mr. Finzel!'s' car I was seated in the

right front seat with Ms. Gordon in the middle., I observed

one of her hands bleeding badly and gave her my handkerchief to

wrap around it. I was later told that her hand was cut when one

of the men who attacked

us at Pine Ridge was cutting Mi. Finzel's

.: hair with a knife and Ms. Gordon tried to stop him.

6.. At Rapid City Regional Hospital the four of us who had been

injured, MI. Finzel,., Ms. Gordon, Mr. Escamilla, and myself

checked into the emergency room where we were each examined

by physicians.

I was feeling great pain in the left shoulder

which had begun to swell. I was also feeling great pain in.

the right knee and was finding it difficult to walk. I also

had pain in the right thunb, the neck and '

the lower back.

Multiple x-rays were taken of all these sites of complaint and

fortunately no fractures or dislocations were found. All of

us except Mi. Escamilla were released from the hospital that

night, with Finzel. and myself being given medicine for pain

Ielief and I was given a sling for my left arm. Mr. Escamilla

remained in the hospital at least until Friday, February 28,1975.

The rest of us went to the !: Alex Johnson Hotel in Rapid :

City where we spent the night.

?

.7. The next morning, Thursday, February 27 I woke up feeling

great pain in the left shoulder, being barely able to move the

left arm and also found it extremely difficult to walk since

my right knee would barely support me. I had had an athletic.

injury to this knee in July 1971 and had an operation for the

removal of the medial miniscus in August 1971. The beating.

which I had received at Pine Ridge evidently re-activated this

old injury site. The five of us, other than Mr. Escamilla,

went that morning to the United States Court House in Rapid

City and gave full statements to agents of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation who told us that they would "investigate the

matter''

..

We asked that Wilson be arrested but got no response

other than the promise to investigate:

Ms. Copleman, Ms.. James.

and I also accompanied two agents of the E.B.I! to the Rapid

City Regional Hospital where they interviewed Mr. Escamilla

In our presence and took a full report from him as to the events

that occurred the preceeding day. That same day we also went

before Judge Bogue in connection with Mr. Escamilla's case.

Judge Bogue adjourned the pre-trial motion to March 19, 1975 in

Rapid City and the trial to March 24 in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

8. Also on February 27 I telephoned Mr. Niebur to advise him

what had happened to the alrplane. I said that I did not think

it would be safe for him to go to Pine Ridge with a mechanic

unless he had protection of law enforcement officers. Later

in the

day he called me and told me that he had

arranged to

fly on Friday, February 28 with a mechanic in another airplane

and that officals of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA; herein-

after)had arranged to meet him there and afford the required

protection. I spoke to MI. Niebur on the telephone on Saturday,

March I and he told me that he had retrieved the plane wich

was flyable although the right gas tank had been punctured

and

was leaking. He also told me that during the time he was at

• the Pine Ridge Reservation Airport no one from the BIA showed

up and he was

surrounded by a hostile crowd who jeered him foi

renting the airplane to me. He told me that he got off as

quickly as he could, being in fear for his own safety.

9. I left Rapid City for homearly Friday morning February 28

via North Central Airlines and United Airlines to Minneapolis

and La Guardia Airpoxt in New York. As of the time of this aff

davit ÷ I still have considerable pain, swelling and hematoma

in the left shoulder with restriction of motion and continued

although both injuries are improving.

10. While I personally viewed the area at Wounded Knee where

events of two years ago were alleged to have taken place, I

do not feel that I have adequately completed the investigation

which I need for the trial of Mr. Escamilla in which I represent

him. Nothing on earth could pursuade me to return to the Pine

Ridge Reservation

to do any further investigation nor would I

ask anyone else to undertake the necessary investigation in

Mr. Escamilla's case or any other case. From what I witnessed

on Februaxy 26, 1975, I believe it would be a long time before

it is safe to carry on any investigative activities for "Wounded

Knee" defendants whose cases are still awaiting trial. I was

offered a personal escort of marshals: for myself or an investi-

gator: by Judge Bogue, but it seems obvious that any adequate

investigation can not be done in any law case when the investi-

gator himself is accompanied by a team of armed law enforcement

officials.

MONA MONTGOMERY advised that on February 26,

1975, she rode from Porcupine to Pine Ridge, South

Dakota, in her own 1903 red Nova, a tour door car.

WILMA POOR BEAR, who is the same as WILMA COLHOFF drove

the car for her.

The van which had been with her group

had left Porcupine and went to Pine Ridge ahead of them.

Upon arriving at Pine Ridge they went to the home of

WILMA's mother and then to the courthouse where they saw

a fracas.

MONICA, whose last name she thinks is CISCERRNOS

(phonetic), her son SHANE, age 2, and some other women

were in the car with she and WILMA.

At the Pine Ridge Airport the van, her car, and

WEBSTER POOR BEAR's pickup truck were all there. When

her car pulled into the airport, WEBSTER told the occupants

of her car to get the hell out of there. She saw no plane

at the airport and said she had heard no shots fired at

all.

MONTGOMERY said she will not sign any statement,

and does not

that this just is not relevant to the assault on her.

She also said there were no weapons in her car whatsoever.

MONTGOMERY advised that when her car left the

Pine Ridge Airport they drove through a bunch of goons

by a turn-off past the airport, drove onto the top of a

hill and stopped to see what was happening. She saw a

rust colored car back up out of a driveway and try to

stop the van.

She again said she heard no shots and saw

nothing else, and her only concern was for her son.

MONTGOMERY said the night before the stabbing she

was at DICK MARSHAL's house together with RUSSELL MEANS,

•WEBSTER and TOMMY POOR BEAR, BILL MESTETH, MARSHAI and

KENNY KANE. TED MESTETH was also with the group. She does

not know DU BRAY OF RED COLOMBE (phonetic).

"Pine Ridge, S.D.

March 5, 1975

"I, John Wallace Means, make the following voluntary

statement to J. Gary Adams and Frederick Coward Jr who

have identified themselves as Special Agents of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). I am aware that

I am being interviewed in regard to the incidents which

occurred on February 26, 1975 at Pine Ridge; S.D. I

am 27 years of age, having been born June 10, 1947 at

Pine Ridge, S.D. I have had 12 years of education. I can

read and write the English language. No promises or

threats have been made to me and no pressure or coercion

of any kind has been used against me.

''Between 2PM and 3PM on Wednesday, February 26,

1975, I was driving a green Ranger pickup, 1974 Ford,

back to Pine Ridge, S.D. Seth Hernandez was with me.

I heard over the 2-way radio in the pickup that Duane

Brewer was at the Court House alone and there were several

American Indian Movement (AIM) guys there also. Fluff

Bettelyoun was calling someone else with this message.

I was just leaving the planning center when we heard this

message.

"I drove to the BIA parking lot and parked directly

across from a green van parked in the street facing west

on the south side of the street. This van had a vent

door on top which was open.

"When I arrived there were several people standing

around. I recognized Russell Means, my cousin, Ski

Jacobs, Duane Brewer, standing around. My brother Popo Means

and

sister, Irene Brewer, were sitting in Duane's

car. Hernandez and I sat in the pickup.

"We sat in the parking lot about 15 minutes

and left and went to the ONAP office. We were there a

couple minutes and started back to the BIA parking lot.

As we passed the tribal cafe, we met the same van that

was previously parked by the court house. This van was

headed east on hwy 18. I don't recall any of the

vehicles following the van.

"I observed Duane Brewer following the van some

distance behind the van. Manny Wilson and Popo Means

were with Duane. I turned around and followed everyone.

"When I approached the airport driveway off Hwy

18, I observed this same green van parked near the first house.

The back doors were open and I observed approximately

20 to 25 people around the van and some 6 other cars in

the area. I observed one individual, a foreign Indian

male, with long hair with a rifle.

"I observed Duane's car parked in the approach to

Donna Mae Pourier's place. The car was backed in. Alvin

Long Soldier's pickup was parked on the right hand shoulder.

Phil Bettelyoun's pickup, a light blue Ford, was parked

in front of Alvin Long Soldier's pickup. I pulled into

the ditch in the vicinity of these two pickups. We sat

in our pickup for several minutes and then got out when

Alvin said they were coming. This meant the people in

the van were coming our direction. I got out of my pickup

and got behind Fred Brewer's pickup, a green Chevrolet, which

was also in the area.

"The green van and about 5 or 6 other vehicles then

came east on Hwy 18. There were approximately 15 rounds

fired from 3 or 4 different guns. I was not hit and the

pickup I was driving was not hit.

"I got in my pickup with Hernandez and we started

back to Pine Ridge. Before leaving the area I had conver-

sation with Joe Big Crow and Alvin Long Soldier about how

close we came to getting hit. I got to the vicinity of

the large fenced in area, heading toward Pine Ridge, to

get some rifles. Roger Big Crow also was with us. We

didn't know where we were going to get the rifles so we

turned around and went back to the airport. We parked in

the ditch on the west side of the approach. I stood by

the pickup and was listening to the 2-way radio.

"After about 20 minutes Chuck Conroy and I went to

Batesland in Conroy's blue jeep. John Hussman and

Tom Conroy followed us. We were in Batesland about 10

minutes

and started back to Pine Ridge. We met Bud Merrill

said there were no road blocks. Merrill also told us

about the airplane at the airport was shot up. We went to

the airport and looked the airplane over. I did not see

any bullet holes. Chuck Conroy told me there were some

in it though.

"Blaine White Eyes, Vince Brewer, Tom Conroy, Seth

Hernandz, Bogie Carlow, John Hussmanwere at the planning

center. I stayed at the Planning Center until 4:30 PM

and then went home.

ECOFFEY ther went into the radio room and told

Dispatcher ORA JANIS to call Chief of Polica SKEE JACOBS.

BorFdY advised that he had asked MESTETH if they took his

gun and

he answered "yes".

ECOFFEY advised that while he was in jail,

"everything was cool," there was no violence and no

, threats

ware made to any of

the Officers. While he was in the

Lieutenant's Difice, he saw JOHN

HUSSMAN picking up the

telephone whenevar

a call came 17.

He said he felt that

HUSSMAN was trying to listen in on each of the calls. He

also saw BILLY VOCU and WILBUR BLACK FEATHER, JR. in the

radio room with ORA JANIS

and it appeared to

him that JANIS

was "very shaken." He said that he also observed DICK

TIM SHANGREAUX and "SAT" RICHARDS and quite a few

other individuals walkin in and out of the lieutenant's

Office. He said he could not remember all of them.

At about this time, WILSON, SHANCREAUX, RICHARDS

and a few others went downstairs to the cell block area.

ECOFFEY

remained upstairs

in the Lieutenant's Office for

about five or seven minutes and then he went downstairs to

get a cup of

coffee and saw wilson, sids Jacobo, and a ter

others standing outside the women's

cell, talking. He said

he did not hear what the conversation was about.

He said he saw BIA Officer BENNIE RICHARDS in

civilian clothes (light blue slackes and I-shirt) downstairs

near the kitchen and that he saw RICHARDS again a little

while later and he was in his police uniform.

He had no

idea what RICHARDS' purpose was in being there, although:

he did advise that RICHARDS and many of the other officers,

when off duty, will come to the Police Department.

ECOFFEY advised that approximately 10 or 15 minutes

alter WILSON want downstairs to the cell block area, SKEE

JACOBS came upstairs and told him as well as the other officers

who were present, to go into 3KEE's Office. He advised that

this group included Officers coming on duty as well as a few of

WILSON's men, including DICK WILSON. He heard WILSON say that

he had great respect for the Police Depariment and felt it was

about time something was done to help them. WILSON also said

something to

the effect that he wanted some of his men to ride

with the Police Officers on their routine patrols.

According

to ECOFFEY, WILSON did not demand this but requested it of both

SKEE JACOBS and NELSON WITT, who was also present. He thinks

there was something said about AIM Security riding with Officers,

but he could not recall exactly what was said. He never heard

any demands made by WILSON or any of his men.

eight year old son had not yet come home from a friends

nobody made any attempt to stop him.

An examination was made of a frame structure

belonging to RIChARD WILSON, which was located in

sub-division known as last Ridge Housing,

This building

exhibited evidence of having been partially destroyed by

fire with extensive damage to the interior or the Structure.

There were no doors or windows existing in the

structure at the time of this examination.

Investigation in the interior of the building

revealed that the most extensive damage was in the southwest •

destruction of cross timbers in the ceiling area of the

building, as well as extensive damage to the ceiling area.

Other parts in the interior of the building also exhibited

extensive damage, but this damage was somewhat less than

that in the southwest portion.

Measurements were taken of the depth of charring

in various sections of the interior of the building and it

was readily discernible that the deepest charring was in

the southwest portion of the house.

Additionally,

comparison

of depth of charring in various portions ot the building

revealed lesser depth in descending portions leading away

from the

southwest corner of the house.

Examination of the exterior of the house

revealed that the most extensive exterior damage to the roof

outer walls was also in the southwest portion of the

Adaitionally, in the southwest exterior corner

of the house extensive charring was noted to the exterior

This particular charring was not found on

any other exterior part of the building.

Examination of the crawl space underneath the

house, as well as the electrical wiring, indicate that

apparently no electricity or gas was connected to the

building.

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

This concerns situ ion at Wounded Knee (WK) i

• Of

5/17/73.

On 5/14/73, a house at Pine Ridge, South Dakota (SD),

owned by Dick Wilson, Oglala Sioux Tribal Council Chair-

man, was destroyed by fire with evidence of possible

arson.

Del Eastman, head of Bureau of Indian Affairs

(BIA) Police, reported concentration of Hippie Type,

Indians and Chicanos at ranch of Frank Fools Crow near

Kyle, SD, which is site for meeting of White House

Delegation and Oglala Sioux Chief and Headsmen on

5/17/73.

Eastman anticipated serving tribal eviction

orders on those individuals unable to give good account

of themselves, however, a Federal restraining order had

been issued preventing Eastman from serving eviction

orders at Fools Crow Ranch.

Restraining order extends

through 5/20/73.

White House Delegation was scheduled

to meet with Oglala Sioux Tribal Chairman Dick Wilson,

9:00 a.m., 5/17/73. Delegation will then proceed

• by

helicopter to ranch of Frank Fools Crow where meeting

will be held with Tribal Chief and Headsmen.

Chief Brand Inspector of SD identified hides of one

bull and five calves of the eleven hides or parts of

hides found inside WK as belonging to local rancher.

Radio station broadcast, Rapid City, SD, 5/17/73,

revealed possibility bonding firm from Florida would

pay $125,000 bond for American Indian Movement (AIM)

leader Russell Means who is presently confined in count:

jail, Sioux Falls, SD.

Search of WK area recovered numerous items with

approximate total value of over $206,000. No additional

arrests made since 5/12/73, and total arrests to date

Searches continue in effort to locate possible

burial sites for weapons and supplies.

warrant executed 5/9/73, on WK Communications Center,

Rapid City, SD, resulted in seizure of quantity of

records including April telephone bill which indicated

calls placed to approximately 514 phones throughout U.S.

and Canada.

Search of buildings inside WK also resulted in

recovery of records which appear to be personal records

of Russell Means.

Records contain possible AIM member-

ship list for north central U.s.

"Rapid City, SD

"March 25, 1975

"I, Vincent Brewer, being duly sworn, make the

following voluntary statement to Ronald E. Brugger who has

identified himself to me as a Special Agent of the FBI.

Agent Brugger has informed me as to the purpose of the inter-

view.

No threats or promises have been made.

"Under the Indian Preference Act a company which is

Indian owned and operated, and located on an Indian reservation,

can be granted a contract if the company meets the low bid of

another company which is a non Indian owned & operated company.

The company can not set the bid but can meet the bid.

"Last Spring, 1974, I personally talked to Dick

Wilson, tribal chairman, at my residence. Wilson came to my

house on his own. I did not invite him.

"Wilson said he could not meet the price per ton of

gravel the Indian Action Team (IAT) had. Wilson said he needed

the business and asked if there was some way he could get the

contract for gravel the IAT was then letting. I told Wilson

- 2 -

NY 55291 DocId: 32989686 Page 543

## Page 544

the only way he could get the contract was to meet the bid

of the other companies.

"I did not know then but I have since found out

Wilson wanted the contract for Lakota Sand and Gravel Company

which I understand is owned by him. In talking to my son,

Bryan Brewer, I understood that Hills Material Company, Hot

Springs, SD, offered a bid of $7.50 per ton, delivered, for gravel

and Oral Sand and Gravel Company, Oral, SD, offered a like

bid. I also understand through Bryan that Wilsons bid was

approximately $11 or $12 per ton of gravel. Bryan told me

after that Wilson "took" the contract.

"At the above mentioned meeting with Wilson I suggested

Wilson go to IAI, Denver, Colorado, to talk the matter over.

Wilson thereafter went with Jim Wilson & Bryan and Bryan told

me the Wilsons did not want to go into IAT after they arrived

in Denver and to the best of Bryans knowledge they did not go

into IAT. Bryan thereafter asked me what he should do because

Wilson was telling Bryan he (Wilson) was going to haul the

gravel and that's all there was to it. I told Bryan to go

ahead and let Wilson haul the gravel and that I would report

it to the FBI which I did.

"I know of no resolution passed by the Tribal Council

which would give IAT the right to offer a contract to a high

bidder. I am currently a tribal councilman and have been

for approximately one and one half years.

"When I first contacted the FBI about the above

I also mentioned a $650,000 street improvement contract which

was to be let by the U. S. government. I told the agent I

contacted, John McCarty, that the money was intercepted by

Richard Wilson and James Wilson and deposited into a bank

in Gordon, iebraska. I had no firm information as to that

allegation but it was more or less rumor which I wanted to pass

onto the FBI.

"I have no first hand knowledge about Lakota Sand

& Gravel Company being paid $10,000 illegally for leveling two

lots in Pine Ridge, SD.

"I have no first hand knowledge about Dick Wilson

being paid a kickback of $65,000 for a street repair contract.

I have read the above statement, of four pages, and it is true

in the best of my knowledge.
