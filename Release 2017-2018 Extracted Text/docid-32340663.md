Press reports in the February 22 and February 23, 1963 editions of

the Cuban Government-controlled newspaper, "Hoy", state that eight Cuban

counterrevolutionaries had been captured as they were attempting to disembark

arms and personnel in Cuba. The Havana report indicates that the arrested

For your information, this Division is currently reviewing the

available information in the matter involving the arrest on December 4,

1 at s, sex at Martin and me 10 ver int vadual associated

with Hemming In his anti-Castro group, "Intercontinental Penetration Forces,"

to determine whether the available admissible evidence would be sufficient

to sustain a successful prosecution of these individuals for violation of

18 U.S. C. 960.

In the event the allegations set forth in your memorandum dated

March 6, 1963 can be established, it is our opinion that the military enter-

prise which resulted in the capture by the Castro forces of the eight counter-

revolutionaries who had reportedly departed from South Florida, could con-

ceivably constitute a violation of Section 960. Accordingly, it is requested

that an appropriate investigation be conducted by the Bureau in this matter

under Section 960 or a conspiracy to violate that code section.
