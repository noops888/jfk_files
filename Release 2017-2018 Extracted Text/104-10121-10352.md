MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Central Cover Staff

ATTENTION

SUBJECT

: M°. Martin J. Lukokie

: Robert A. MAHEU

03 1. On 3 March 1971 I received a telephone call from

(Frank Monas? an Agency employee assigned to the Retirement

Affairs Division, Office of Personnel. He asked 11 1 knew an

Ed Mullis, who was a former Agency employee.. I replied in

the affirmative. He stated that Mullin had just called him and

was interested in talking with me regarding his present position.

He stated that Mullin le presently employed by an organization

known as Intertel. I immediately recognised this outfit to be the

group recently employed by Howard Hughes to take over the

operation formerly performed by Mabeu Associates.

2. In my subsequent convereation with Mullin, he advised

that he recently retired from Government and bas taken employment

with Intertel. He described this organination as one that looks into

operations of large corporations to ascertain whether any of their

assets are being directed toward activities controlled by organized

crime. He cited the National Football League an one of their clients.

They alno have been engaged by Howard Hugher to look into his Las

Vegas operation which was formerly managed by Mabeu. Mullin

who werved in the DDP while in the Agency seemed to recall that

Maheu had some connection with un, but admitted he knew very

little about the association. He stated that he had spent several

weeks in Las Vegas going over the recorde pertinent to the tranafer

of the administration of the Hughes Interests to his organization, and

he would like guidance from un as to what he should do should they

develop Agency connections with the Maheu organization.

3. One of the things that concerns Mullin is that in

perusing the material, they have noted that several of the recorde

are miusing. They want to be sure that if Mahou states that these

particular records were purged from the files becaune they pertai

to sensitive Goverament operations, this in actually the case and

not a subterfuge to withhold pertinent information which could be

uned in the forthcoming law suit involving Hughes and Mabeu.

4. I told Mullin that we may have on certain occasions

uned Maheu in the paat possibly for cover purposes. I further

told him that I was reasonably sure there wan no connection with

him at the present time.

5. He alked whom he should contact within the Agency

mhould any quentions srite during the course of their investigation.

I told him that I should be the point of contact. He relterated that

he wanted to do all he could to preclude any embarrassment or

compromise of Agency operations and would be in touch with me

for any guidance in thin regard.

6. On 15 Marchil 971 Mullin called me from La Vegas and

stated that in investinatina one of Maheu'e operations, he ran acros

the name of

Who purportedly recently represented

Maheu's Inturants inlyuto, Ecuador In checking into the background

of this individual, he noted that he had previouly been associated

with an import-export firm in Miani prior to coming with Maheu.

He was calling to determine whether we had any interest in thin

individual, and if no, how should he bandle this facet of his Inventi-

gation. I advined him that the name meant nothing to me, but l

would check and call him back. He informed me that he was planning

to leave for (Quito) in the next day or two, but in the meantime, could

be contacted at the Frontier Hotel, phone code 702, 735-9186.

7. Our records show that

was lasued a Covert

Security Approval on 19 December 1967 for utilization

The file further Indicates that

ment a letter of

resignation to Maheu'« Las Vegas offlee effective 31 December

1970.

B. A check of Mullin' security file shows that he semigned

from CIA on 31 July 1961 to go with the Department of Justice.

An of 1l February 1969 an approval of linison was lonued to Mullin

who was then identified as Chief, Intelligence and Organized Crime

Diviston, Bureau of Narcotica and Dangerous Drups, Department

of Justice. His security file in entirely clear.

9. While I have never had a close association with Mullin,

of hia country. I am inclined to believe that his offer to assist um

in any way to preclude the nurfacing of our utilization of Maheu le

sincere.

10. In discusing this matter with the Director of Security,

it was hin feeling that we advise Mullin that the Agency bad an

interest in some of

activities ir

but they have

been terminated; and further, there la no Agency connection with

the Maheu organisation at the present. Howeves, should any further

questions arise concerning

we should ak him to contact

an for further discussion.

11. I have promined to call Mullin in the very near future

and would appreciate early comments on the bandling of this matter.

James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security (PTOS)
