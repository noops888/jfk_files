WH/COG 71-93

15 MAR 7971

NEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT

: Status of ANCALL-I Ransom Negotiation

1.

On 26 August 1970, $120,000 ranson was

paid for the release of AMCALL-1.

$70,000 of this

amount was paid by the Agency and AMCALL-I's wife

arranged to obtain the remaining $50,000 from

August Vanistendael, a prominent Belgian with high

level Vatican connections interested in AMCALL 1

who presumably provided the additional money. Al-

though there was no firm commitment as to the exact

time AlCALL-l's release would be effected, AMECRU-1 .

anticipated his release within 60-90 days after

payment of the ransom.

2.

Although 6 months have now elapsed since

ANECRU-1 delivered the money to the Cuban negotiator

In Paris, there was no way to determine the reason

for the delay in AlCALL-l's release until ALECRU-1

was able to return to Paris to discuss the matter

with the GOC representative authorized to negotiate

the ransom cases.

Since AHECRU-] now resides in

Miani he is no longer able to maintain as close

contact with the Paris official as was the case when

he lived in Barcelona. However, he did arrange a

trip to Paris in January to discuss the status of

AlCALL-l and other ransom candidates with the GOC

representative. While the talks were still in

AMECRU-1

• Station has consistently been advised to

avoid any indication of ClA interest in any ransom

case, other than AYSOUR-1, littlo concrete information

as obtained regarding ANCALL-l's status or the GOC

time table for his release.

After AMECRU-1 concluded

his Paris talks the early part of February he left

for Caracas where he is expected to remain until the

latter part of March before returning to Miami.

Although

a full report on the results of his Paris

negotiations can not be obtained until he returng

to Miami, AMECRU-1 has been in touch with AMCALL-I's

wife and QUPILL-1 the

asset handling the

AMSOUR-1 case.

Accorang to AlCALL-l's wife,

AMECRU-I

advised her the GOC representative in Paris indicated

the delay in releasing AlCALL-l was partially based

on the fear expressed by certain GOC officials of

AMCALL-l's potential leadership in exile movements

if he is

freed.

As & rebuttal to this GOC argument

AMECRU-1 wrote

• letter to Manuel Pineiro, the DGI

Director in Cuba, stating that A!CALl-l had no desire

or intention of

engaging in political activities

after his release and wished to seek employment with

SOme European social research organization.

A letter

from August Vanistendael verifying ANCALL-l's intentions,

with assurance from Vanistendael that he would assist

in resettling AMCALL-] in Europe, was attached to

ANECRU-I letter to Pineiro.

The

Icase officer

obtained copies of the AXECRU-I letters to Pineiro

from QUPILL-I and forwarded them to Headquarters.

ANECRU-1 also told AlCALL-l's wife that

the coc paris representatives offered to return

the ransom money if the interested parties were

not satisfied with the current progress of the

case.

The ramifications involving any demand for

return of AlCALL-l's ransom and termination of any

further efforts to obtain his release are considerably

greater than was the case with AUPANIC-7 whose entire

ransom was provided by the Agency. In the case of

AXCALL-1,

there would be no way to demand return of

our share of the ransom without exposing Agency

interest until such time as the Catholic contributorg

indicate a desire to recover their $50,000 investment.

Not only did Vanistendael's letter fail to indicate

any concern in this respect, but clearly emphasized

his continuing deep interest in obtaining ANCALL-I's

freedom.

AMCALL-l's wife is also insistent that bis

chance of being released not be endangered during

this precarious stage of the negotiation and that

any decision concerning return of the ransom be

determined by AMECRU-1's evaluation of GOC intent.

Although ANCALL-l's wife has always been discreet

and her relationship with the Agency cooperative and

above

reproach, her understandable anxiety over her

husband could lead to extreme resentment should any

attempt be made to recover the Agency's share of

the ransom at this juncture.

This would be particularly

true if the Catholic contributors show no alarm over

their investment or the present lack of progress made

in effecting AMCALL-l's release.
