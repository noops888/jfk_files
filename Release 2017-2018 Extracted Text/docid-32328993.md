MM 105-1742

MM 724-S advised on March 13, 1962 that

CARLOS RODRIGUEZ QUESADA and LAUREANO BATISTA FALLA,

referred to in enclosed etterhead memorandum, stated

they had made a release to the Unded Press and were '

informed that this demonstration would be given world-

wide coverage.

The press release, as explained by

MM /24-S, will indicate that "President KENNEDY had

been misintormed in connection with the ill-fated

invasion of Cuba, April 17, 1961, and it is desired

to prevent his being misinformed

again, since he

reportedly supports JOSE MIRO CARDONA, President of

the Cuban Revolutionary. Council." MM 724-S continued

the demonstrators realized they were breaking the law,

and although they did not want to break the law, they

believed the cause needed national recognition;

there-

fore, they held the demonstration. C

Close liaison in this matter is being main-

tained with Detective Sergeant CHARLES SAPP, Miami Police

Department, and upon réceipt of initial information, he

was so advised. (U)
