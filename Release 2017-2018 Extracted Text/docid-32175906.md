TRAPNELL alleging a plot by Cuban refugees as of 5/63 or

6/63, to kill Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY.

Investigation

was discontinued in view of TRAPNELL's mental condition, after

extensive investigation had failed to identify FUENTES of

any other subject allegedly involved.

In view of past experience with information

received from TRAPNELL, and the fact that to date no

evidence

that LEE HARVEY OSWALD has been in Miami was

developed, no investigation based on the Baltimore airtel

of 11/23/63 is being conducted.
