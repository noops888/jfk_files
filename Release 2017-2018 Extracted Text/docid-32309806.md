Memorandum to Mr. Rosen

RE: ISADORE IRVING DAVIDSON

Washington, D. C.; and Banyan Cafeterias,

*Inc., a Florida corporation.

Our investigations have not disclosed any evidence of payoffs or

kickbacks being made to Hoffa or other Teamsters

or Pension Fund

officials in connection with these loans and Davidson has denied any

such kickbacks or payoffs.

A current investigation under the White Slave Traffic Act

(WSIA) involving prostitution in Washington, D. C.,

indicated that

Vavidson upon interview admitted he had used prostitutes made avail-

able to him by a steward in the Variety Club in the Willard Hotel.

Davidson also arranged for a prostitute to fill a date with Leonard

a former Assistant United States Attorney in Milwaukee now

practicing law in Miami, Florida.

Bursten is a friend of Davidson's

and has also been involved in several transactions relating to loans

from the Teamsters Pension Fund.

In connection with this investi-

gation, Departmental

attorneys have expressed a keen interest in our

investigation and all copies of reports have been furnished to the

Department.

It is anticipated that the facts concerning the WSTA

Investigation will be presented to a Federal Grand Jury in Washington,

the Kennedy Administration.

business 'for the

Israelis.
