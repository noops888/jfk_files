made of the recent "SAWYER incident", in which former Orlando

Police Captain R. D. SAWYER had been subpoenaed to testify before

a Special Federal Grand Jury probing organized crime and gambling

at Orlando.

(It is to be noted that SAWYER was subsequently

fired from the Orlando Police Department as a result of his

associations with known gamblers in the area):

Continuing,

GOODE said that RODENBAUCIl's conversation with

JOHNSTONE then led into past corruption within the Orlando

police Department and RODENBAUGH explained "how bad things were

when he, RODENBAUGH, was Chief of Detectives."

(GOODE explained

that this latter period covered part of 1951

and most of 1952)

GOODE stated that RODENBAUGH then advised Chief JOHNSTONE

that sometime during that period he, RODENBAUGH,

had a meeting

in a parking lot by Orange Memorial Hospital, Orlando, with

HARLAN BLACKBURN.

At that time the two of them discussed arrests

that had been made of lottery operators in the area and that

BLACKBURN had asked him, RODENBÄUGH, to go with him, BLACKBURN,

to Tampa, Florida in order to meet BLACKBURN's boss.

RODENBAUGH

said that BLACKBURN named his boss as being "TRAFFICANTE", "but

did not state his first name. RODENBAUGH stated that he told

BLACKBURN he would

not ride with him to Tanpa, but would meet

him in Tampa.

Continuing, RODENBAUGH advised that he did meet BLACKBURN

in Tampa and was taken to an office there and introduced to

"TRAFFICANTE". He further advised that the purpose of this

conference between BLACKBURN, TRAFFICANTE, and himself was for

the the purpose of placing himself (RODENBAUGH) On TRAFFICANTE'S

payroll and that when they got around to that discussion,.

TRAFFICANTE told RODENBAUGH that a great number of the latter's

detectives were on his payroll at that time.

"RODENBAUGH said

he told TRAFFICANTE that he doubted that statement, however,

TRAFFICANTE sent BLACKBURN Into a room to bring him in a record

book and RODENBAUGH was then shown a book containing a number of

detectives®

names and the amount

of money they had been paid.

RÖDENBAUGH then explained to Chief JOHNSTONE and Lieutenant

GOODE that he felt this evidence was "too weak! for him to

täke any official action upon, "because it would be my word

against, the words of the detectives involved, and i was unable

take possession of the

record book."

RODENBAUGH also informed
