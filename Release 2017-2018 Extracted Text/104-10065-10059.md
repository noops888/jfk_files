Office of Legislative Counsel

23 August 1978

DDCI:

Pardon the form of this communication, but it

should get to you this morning early.

Promising negotiations on the Proenza and lexico

history came apart yesterday eventing when Blakey came

back on the scene.

We seemed to be on the verge of

agreeing that they would accept a five months period.

from the Proenza 201 file (not the ops file) aro

sanitized sections of the lexico history, limited to

Blakey and Cornwell only. No junior or other HSCA

staffers. We viewed this as showing that the papers

had nothing to do with the HSCA charter, while showing

good faith at the same time.

Blakey argues that he must see the entire Mexico

City history

to understand the

Station, which he intonds to try to evaluate.

He also

plans to 50 to Havana again, where he plans to inter

view froenza, and wants to know everything about her,

etco, in preparation for his meeting with her. We

continue to feel it hasn't anything to do with the

real HScA charter.

Blakey made it clear that if he sees it he will

want: staff nembers also to see it, the likely

candidates being highly unacceptable for their renark-

able imaturity.

Stokes is out of town, but Blakey says he can get

in touch with him.

It we have to go through Blakey

Stokes' answer doubtleas will be "give."

Ne seem to have run this course, and now have

the threat of subpoena hanging over us.

I propose an

early meeting: Acting DDO (perhaps with Chiefs IA Div

ison and CA Staff), Gelleral Counsel, Legislative Counsel

and Me.
