T1360-63

As was submitted during his visit to Helsinki several months

ago, the impression which he

left as a statesman

is.

negative.

Some of the opinions expressed in official and political

circles are as follows'..

the incident of the death of the presi-

dent is of a nature to

alter conditions of domestic policy;

in spite of the certainty of KENNEDY's Democratic Party candidacy

in the future elections, now the party will be the scare of a

great dispute; however, from the struggle between the

and liberal wings of the

party, it can be expected that

NIXON will be the victor.

The primary point wnich these cirbles

upon: 45

that the incident of the sudden withdrawal from che

scene of

RENNEDY whose perscnality was forcefully felt on east-west

(B val relations) which

are taking a favorable disection despite

the

deviations

Recentlys

destructive. reactions

on these relations.
