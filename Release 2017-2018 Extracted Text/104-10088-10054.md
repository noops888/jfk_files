Surveillance of Cuban Consulate Mexico

City tHE

1. On 9 February 1965, AMIMUG/1 identified a

photograph of Luisa RODRIGUEZ Calderon, who he stated

had been connected with the DGI (Directorio General de

Inteligencia) and the former Secretary of the Young Com-

munists in the Cuban Ministry of Exterior Commerce.

According to AMMUG/1, the Cuban Government thought

RODRIGUEZ had been recruited by the United States

Government while in Mexico so she was recalled to Cuba.

AMMUG/1 was not sure of the details but recalled something

concerning her having received a letter from an American.

Further, AMMUG/1 recalled something about an American

student who visited Cuba who was supposed to have made a

recruitment pitch to RODRIGUEZ or been associated in some

manner with a pitch made to her. AMMUG/1 did not know

the source of these alleged pitches.

This photograph is part of the surveillance of the

Cuban Consulate in Mexico City and was taken from Film

No. 293, Photograph 16, dated 12 December 1953.
