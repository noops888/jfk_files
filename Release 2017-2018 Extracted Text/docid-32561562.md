Re Bureau airtel 5/29/62.

PH 623-C* and PH 614-C-TE reported on 5/24/62 that

ANGELO BRUNO (Commission Representando Officiale - Philadelphia

area) and PASQUALE MASSI, aka PAT MASSI, of Camden, N. J.,

discussed the arrival of

an adult male from Italy 6/15/62

New York City.

MASSI is member of La Causa Nostra and presently

operates St.

George Motel, Camden, N. J., area.

Since 5/24/62 both informants have been unable to

furnish additional identifying information concerning this

visitor or BRUNO's intentions concerning the visitor.

Pertinent portions of conversations by BRUNO and MASSI,

reported by PH 623-C*, were intelligible and are set forth below:

BRUNO stated,

"I was in New York 5/23/62." "The father

and

son there (New York) they came from Italy and used to be

with CAMPI." (phonetic) (not known if reference is to LOU

CAMPBELL - Camden, N. J., hoodlum)
