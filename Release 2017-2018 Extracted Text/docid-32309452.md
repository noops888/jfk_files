(JFK)

The April 26, 1961 edition of the "Miami News"

a newspaper published daily in Miami, Florida, contained

an article stating that a new group calling itself the

Anti-Comminist Legionnatres Intended to ask the United

States Government for recognition and to supply it with

arms and materials. A spokesman for the group said that

young Americans were sickened by what happened to the

brave band of Cubans that invaded Cuba the previous week

and want to help them.

B. APraux:

4721

The article stated that the commander of this

organization, former Army Major George Tanner, age 37,

of West. Palm Beach, Florida, said the group is going

to be trained for guemlla combat. The men's ages range

from 19 to 37 and most of them have had some military

experience.

3. stea

Paul Alvic, age

• 24, from New York City, second

in command, stated the group was not getting paid, was not

looking for money, but the communists would have to be

fought sooner or later and that the United States" welfare

Was

at stake as well as Cuba's.

He said the present need

was for uniforms, food and a large place to train the men.

Alvic said the group is not connected with any agency of

the United States Government or Cuban rebel organization.

The men in the group have drifted in from some 20 different

states, having been previously turned down at Cuban recruit-

ing centers.

The organization included a judo expert from

Lexington, Kentucky, and an intelligence man with Korean

War experience.

Re: ANTI-COMMUNIST LEGIONNAIRES

On April 28, 1961, MY Tol, who has been

connected with Cuban revolutionary activities for the

past three years and who has furnished reliable infor-

mation in the past, advised that the leader of this

organization; a tall American with a blonde mustache,

name unknown,

was recruiting in Miami for membership

in this organization for future military action against

This leader claimed that he was awaiting clearance

from the United States Goverment, which he expected to

obtain in about two days and that he was in contact

with different Cuban revolutionary leaders.

MM T-I said this American leader claimed to

have worked with Sergio Sanjenis, former Castro Government

official presently in jail in Cuba

for counterrevolutionary

activities

MM. Tol advised that Ed Colby of New York Gity

had joined this group and is active in it. MM Tol

explained that Colby is an American citizen of doubtful

reliability who has been previously connected with Cuban

revolutionary activities.

MM T-1 explained that this

organization claimed to have between 45 and 50 members

in Miami. Some of the members were staying at the Hotel

Cuba, some were living In Miami Bayfront Park, and some

were meeting at the Hotel Everglades.

Miam, Florida, advised

that there were some Americans residing at that hotel

and that at 11:00 A. M. that day, Julio fernandez:

representative of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico

(FRD), an anti Castro organization, was going to talk

to some of the Americans at that hotel.

Kambis said that Jerry (Last Name Unknown) »

a tall blond American, claimed to be a

former aide to

MM. T-1

stated that Tanner selected different

individuals in this organization to be officers and appointed

the majority of the members as either captains or majors.

When it became obvious that Tanner knew nothing about mili-

tary affairs and was doing ridiculous things, the organization

threw him out and Jerry Hannon became the leader of the

organization. "Hannon has claimed he left the Cuban Revolu®

tionary Army more than a year ago, says he works with Sanchez

Cuba and will try and obtain support from the United States

MM ToI said that the training camp established

by this organization in the Florida Everglades is located

somewhere two or three miles west of the Tamiami Fishing

Camp on the Tamiami Trail between Tampa and Miami, Florida.

told them that theywould have to move and they could not

remain at that camp site but would be free to operate at

a site about ten miles west of where they were flu)

MIDENTIA

Re: ANTI-COMMUNIST LEGIONNAIRES

On May 5, 1961, MM Tol advised that inasmuch

as the invasion of Cuba by anti-communist rebels on

April 17, 1961 was a fallure, the morale of Cuban revolu-

MM Tol explained that the

different established Cuban revolutionary organizations

have never recruited Americans, have never taken Americans

and, although these organizations would accept many

donations of equipment, generally never took Americans

along on proposed military expeditions.

Now there is

no hope of overthrowing the

present Cuban Government by military action, consisting

of only anti-communist Cuban rebels, and Cubans in Miami

are asking for United States and Organization of American

States intervention. The Cubans feel that they cannot

overthrow the Castro Government alone and are depending

upon outside help.

Therefore, recruiting activity has

ceased and although the Cubans are grateful that indivi

duals and members of the Anti-Communist Legionnaires

want to help, the Cubans are not interested.

the can in co

MM T-1 said

that persons active in revolutionary activities do not

expect Anti-Communist Legionnaires to leave Miami, parti-

cipate in any action against Cuba and think it will be

only a matter of time until the organization dissolves.

MM T-1 explained that Miami has been a place

attracting all sorts of adventurers and opportunists

and that the Anti-Coumunist Legionnaires is just one of

.

the many such organizations that have come and gone.

MM T-I on May 5, 1961 advised that Colonel

Roberto Casanova. Miami Beach,

Florida, is one of the

leading Venezuelan revolutionists in Miami, Florida,

working to overthrow the present government of Venezuela.

Casanova has been contacted by one of the representatives

of the Anti-Communist Legionnaires, has been told of the

training camp the organization has

in the Florida Ever-

glades, and Casanova is expected to send a representative

to inspect the fratning camp on esthe May 7 of 8, 19617S04)
