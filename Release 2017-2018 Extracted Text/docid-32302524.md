MANNARINO, aka.

AR;

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.

With regard to PHILLIP BETTOR, who has been reported previously

to have been bookkeeper for the MANNARINO organization, or

5/15/61, PG 545-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III as follows:

Apollo, Pa.

The lower floor of

NAMEY, who 1s BETTOR's brother-in-law.

Since BETTOR is unmarried

he lives alone but Mr. and Mrs. DAVE NAMEY live in an apartment

next to his.

BETTOR works daily in his Army Surplus Store on Fifth Avenue,

New Kensington, Pa.

On Thursday and Saturday the store is open

until 9PM and on other days, except Sunday, it closes at 6PM.

Generally, BETTOR goes home to his apartment after his store

• the dans to

closes

although occasionally he has "dates"

with Jewish friends.

BETTOR

no longer frequents the clubs.in New Kensington but once

in awhile

he goes to the various supper clubs in Monroeville, Pa.

If

BETTOR still keeps books

for the MANNARINOs, It is unlikely that

he

does so at his apartment.

It is more probable that he keeps them

in his second

floor office.at the rear of his store, where there

are necessary

• items like adding machines and file cabinets.

Informant, who can visit BETTOR either at his apartment or his

store, will attempt to obtain more information to resolve the

question concerning BETTOR and the MANNARINO books.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
