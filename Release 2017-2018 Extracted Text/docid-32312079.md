advised by SA CURTIS that any FBI interest in LAND was unknown

to hin.

ALEXANDER then commented that he had known for several

years that a photograph of LANE as the subject of a masochist

rite was in existence and that he (ALEXANDER) has acquired this

photograph recently fron an undisclosed source in New York.

ALEXANDER continued that MARK LANE had

been critical

of Dallas authorities and

the FBl and had caused a lot of

trouble for Dallas authorities.

He stated that if MARK LANE

should return to Dallas he would be confronted with this

photograph.

SA CURTIS viewed that photograph which deptets a man

nude, with his arms taped behind him, sexually aroused, and his

sex organs being tortured.

A photograph of MARK LANE contained in Dallas files

was viewed by SA CURTIS who states that if the man in the

photograph exhibited by Mr. ALEXANDER iS not MARE LANE, such

individual bears definite similarities to bin.

Copies of this communication are furnished the New York

-Office for Information as that office was fornerly the office

at-grigin in the LANE case and may have some knowledge of the

existence of a photograph of LANE as deseribed above.

The foregoing information

is furnished for the informa-

tion of the Bureau, 72J New York and New Orleans and will not be

submitted in Lill for dissemination, lACS, as to disseminate such

intormation it is felt contact vith ALEXANDER nould have to be

made as he indicated he was exhibiting the photograph "confidentially".

To indicate to ALEXANDER that this bureau had an interest in MARk:

LANE is not considered advisable, inasmuch as ALEXANDER was a

somewhat controversial figure in connection with the investigation

concerning the leals of information to the press concerning OSWALD'S

diary during the course of the assassination investigation.
