Re Bonn letter 8-22-62.

On 12-6-62 the BKA (Bundeskriminalamt - West German Federal Criminal

Police) was asked to det√©rmine whether HELMUT FRIEDRICH MAIER is still in

Munich, Germany, and if so, what his current plans are regarding travel to the

United

States.

On 12-31-62 the BKA advised that the Munich Police had determined

that MAIER is still maintaining his residence at #7/V Nordendstrasse, Munich 13,

but that for the past six weeks he has been in the United States, where he can

reportedly be reached under the name FRED H. MAIER at 2185 Le Moine Avenue,

Apt. 7-8, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
