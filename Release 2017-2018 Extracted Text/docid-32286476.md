Dear Mr. Frohbose,

Salvatore Momo Giancana..

Tia-170*

Thank you for your letter of April 25th, 1968, and the

., photograph of Salvatore Nomo Giancana:

?.

The photograph was shown extensively throughout both

casinos at Freeport and unfortunately. none of theemployees

seem to remember Glancana alias Mancuso.

3.

A.S.P. Paul Thompson contacted a usually reliable source

and when shown Giancana's photograph immediately Identified

him to be Nicky Mancuso, also known as John Williams.

According to A.S.P. Thompson's source, Giancana was at

Freeport approximately two months a80

using the name or john

mand. at that time he was

Lucayan Beach Hotel or the Kings Inn. The

'liams and he stayed at either the

source, an ex-Chicago

police officer claims to have been in conversation with Giancana

Giancana is said to have offered Mr. Thompson's source a

job at the Jandman Hetel LasVegas.

The informant described

the Landmark. Hotel as being located

near Las Vegas Convention

Hall and that it is a round building with a "bubble on the roof".

informant stated that Glancana frequents the M.G.M. Lounge,

1638 South Cicera, Chicago, Illinois.

5.

It is unfortunate. that the hotels at Freeport do not keep

files of their guests as far back as two months ago and our

efforts to get corroborátionaproved fruitless.

CONF INENT IAN

I must adnit that I find it rather strange that none of

the casino employees seem

to remember Glancana alias Mancuso,

but on the other hand, it may be a case of milful blindness.

on that assessment I am taking steps to ensure that Giancana

vlew.to

having him declared undesirable.
