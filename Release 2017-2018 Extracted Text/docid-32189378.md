The evening newspaper, "Le Monde", reveals that a

new nystery has arisen in the

investigation of the assassina-

tion of President KSNIODY, as 1t showed that certain

reproductions of a photograph in which IN HARVEY OSWALD

held "the murder weapon" were falsiiied.

The dally

refors to an extensive study made by the

French weekly, "Los Cahiers Du Centre D'Etudes Soctalistes"

(Notebooke of the Condor of Socialist Studles), concerning

three photographs inserted in different publications, ta

which the presumed assassin Of KENNEDY appears with a gun

in hand and a revolver at his waist, revealing that

"Investigations made on these have

shown that the photographs

were medified."

Then, "Le londe" recalls that after the essassinaties,

the Dallas police hastened to communicate to the press

reporte "on a dozen proofs", among them a photo of OSWALD

with the two

weapons.

And it adds:

"The photo published by the weekly

"Newsweek" showed OSwALD with a gun without a telescope.

while this telescope

is quiteevisible in the photo printed

by

"Poris Match" and "Life"

"Be that as it may," it says in conclusion, "the

deception is obvious.

A person or a group of persons were

interested in having it belloved that OSWALDIS, weapon was

the one used to kill KENNEDY."
