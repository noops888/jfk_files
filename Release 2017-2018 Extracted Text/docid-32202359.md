interrupting?

Sure - go ahead.

HI:

Branch of the Agency --

in Washington in 1966 and he retired from the Agency in 1967

on December 31. Now, Mr. Harvey, does that summarize basically

part of your background, at least that we discussed?

That is correct. I would like to add one thing, if i

may. During both the Berlin

was on the hoes of the, fordign service os state, which

raises

a Little question of propriety.

But I want you to know that

in the handling of this.

B:

All right.

I first asked. you with regard to any

knowledge of any assassination plans of plots within

the Agency concerning Patrice Lumumba and you

might indicate

what your response was to that, Mr. Harvey.

H:

I have no personal knowledge of any such plan or

operation within or on the part of the Agency.

B :

I also asked you apart from the question of Fidel

Castro whether or not you had any knowledge of

any assassination plans or plots in the Agency that involved

any other

foreign leader.
