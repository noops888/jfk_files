RE: JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA, FRANK J. MATULA, JR.

63-7145

NOTE:

Matula is an International Trustee of the Teamsters

Union. LA-4350-C has advised ouf LA office that when

Matula served time in the County Jail and County honor

farm several years ago in connection with a perjury

conviction he became very depressed and actually cried.

As a result of this Matula reportedly would do anywing

to prevent

himself from being incarcerated again. This

source stated that because of Matula's experience, he is

very cautious in getting directly involved in situations

that could cause him trouble with law enforcement.

Matula is presently on parole in connection with this

perjury conviction.

Matula has been

contacted recently by our lA office

in an effort to obtain access to Local 396 records in

connection with case captioned

| "Mike Harabedian; Frank J.

Matula, Jr. etal LMRA-IM Bufile 122-3019.

Matula at time

of this contact advised he would

first have to contact the

Union attorney to obtain permission. The Union attorney

later advised our LA office that the General Coungel of

the Union desired a subpoena be issued for the books and

records.

It is felt the above facts indicate an interview

with Matula as outlined in this airtel might be

benefitial and should be conducted.
