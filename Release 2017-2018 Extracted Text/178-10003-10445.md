18 June 1975

Mr. James A. Wilderotter

Associate Counsel to the President

Room 182

Old Executive Office Building

Washington, D.C.

Dear Jim:

As you can readily see from the attached memoranda

and files, this collection of papers is incomplete,

disorganized, fragmentary and by no means a coherent

account of MONGOOSE or anything else.

However, this is what we have pulled together.

This is what

has seen and for some reason

he is quite comortable with it. He has asked if he

could have this on loan to be returned Friday evening

for his use in connection with the Committee's interviews

of Rusk, McNamara, Maxwell Taylor and others.

As I told you on the phone there isn't anything

in this file which they haven't already seen and I shall

be grateful to you for what help you can offer.

Sincerely,

Weet Elder

Walter Elder

Assistant to the Director
