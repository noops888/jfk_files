To furnish additional information relating to news reporter

Kent Biffle's interest in captioned subject.

DETAILS: Kent Biffle's name was noted, among others, in personal papers

belonging to Lee Harvey Oswald (Bufile 105-82555-2579). Biffle was

interviewed by the FBI on 12/16/63 (Bufile 105-82555-1212).

He advised

that he was formerly employed by the Fort Worth (Texas) Press as a reporter

in the latter part of 1959 and had been assigned to prepare articles on

Oswald's defection.

He mentioned no personal contacts with Oswald, but

stated he utilized public source information on Oswald and had contact

with Oswald's mother and brother for background information. He also

which he actually knew about Oswald KEG-45.

stated that the resultant articles (three) contained "all the information

Since source information does

not disclose the results of anym

between Biffle and Oswald while Oswald was at the Hotel Metropole

in Moscow in 1959;isince the FBI did interview Biffle concerning his

interest in Oswald, which he explained; since the new details add nothing

nor change what is known; and since further written dissemination of these

new cetail albi only serve to pontic a tier source on

potential, resultant publicity, it is not felt that written
