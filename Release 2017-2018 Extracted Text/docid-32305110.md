Re New York teletype to New Haven 7/7/64.

Confidential sources in the New Haven Division were contacted in

connection with individuals who might attend the funeral of

ROCCO FISCHETTI and no information was obtained indicating that

any unerworld associate would attend the funeral.

NH 415-C-TE, characterized as a close associate of leading

hoodlums in Conn. and New York areas, including members of La

Cosa Nostra, advised that in his estimation ROCCO FISCHETTI

was a "nothing" and that his brother JOSEPH was the big man in

the rackets.
