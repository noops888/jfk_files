PHILADELPHIA (92-444) (P)

ANGELO BRUNO, aka.

(00: PHILADELPHIA)

Outstanding Bureau instructions captioned matter

requires daily teletype.

Currently Philadelphia receives on a continuing and

almost daily basis highly sensitive information from PH 591-C*,

and PH 614-C-TE. Information from these sources

Is of such a rature that It requires the Philadelphla Division

to send almost daily encoded teletypes.

Frequently information

received was furnished auxiliary offices particularly the

Miami and Newark Divisions thereby causing considerable time

to encode and uncode these messages.

It is felt that it would be both economical and more

secure to handle communications as a daily summary airtel

rather than teletype in this matter.

It is requested Bureau authority be granted to submit

daily summary airtels rather than teletypes for the above-

outlined reasons.

BRUNO CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
