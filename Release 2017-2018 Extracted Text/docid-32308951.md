Re San Francisco airtel to Bureau, 3/14/69.

On 3/13/69 SF 2550-C-TE furnished the following

information to SA RUDOLPH H. MANCINI:

On 3/12/69 Informant contacted MANNY FIGLIA,

Under Boss, San Jose ICN Family, during which time they

discussed the recent libel suit

filed 3/5/69, U.S. District

Court, San Francisco, by JOE CERRITO, ICN Boss of the San

Jose Family, against Life Magazine for an additional $7,000,000

Informant commented to FIGLIA that PETE MISURACA was probably

"fuming" because the newspapers in referring to the suit, again

made reference to the HAROLD SMITH matter to which MANNY

replied "If you think PETE is unhappy, you should see JOE

(CERRITO) , he's really sick."

Informant said to MANNY "What do you mean, didn't he

file

the new suit?"

and MANNY replied "Yeah, but he didn't

want to. He's sick of the whole thing.

He wanted to leave

sleeping dogs lie.

He doesn't want the money, all he wanted

was a retraction."

FIGLIA then related that CERRITO and his wife,

during the past week, were guests at his home for a birthday

party. MANNY said "You should see that guy, he's so

depressed and sick that he couldn't even

eat a piece of

cake." FIGLIA commented that CERRITO's "wife and kid" are

"mad at JOE" for all of the trouble, particularly the adverse

publicity and the loss of his dealership. The Informant

told FIGLIA that he could not understand

I why CERRITO filed

a new libel suit if he wanted to forget the

MANNY

concluded

the discussion by saying "You don't understand,

you don't understand".

Informant added that he did not

press FIGLIA further for discussion on the matter, however,

it was his impression that someone convinced CERRITO to file

the most recent libel action against Life Magazine against

his wishes.
