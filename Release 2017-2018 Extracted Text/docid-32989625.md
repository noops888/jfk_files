RE:

REQUEST PERTAINING TO

ELECTRONIC SUEVEILIANCI

During a meeting on May 30, 1975, attended by Mark

Gitenstein and John T. Elliff, SSC Staff Members, representatives

of the Bureau and K. Willian O'Connor, Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination, the SSC representatives agreed to

accept a summary of this Bureau's activities during the 1964

DNC at Atlantic City, New Jersey.

The following is a chronological account obtained

tron a

review of logical Bureau files regarding FBI coverage

of the

DNC held August 24-28, 1964, In Atlantic City,

New Jersey.

BASIS FOR FBI INTEREST AND COVERAGE OF THE DNG, 1964%

ATLANTIC CINY,

NEY JENSEY

On June 1, 1004, Mr. Burke Marshall of the Civil

Rights Division of the Justice Department contacted FBI

Assistant Director C. A. Evans and advised he had received a

call irom a representative of the Democratic National Committee

who advised that a meeting was to be held that day in Atlantic

City to discuss security arrangements for the DNC. Nx. Marshall

stated those in charge of the convention were concerned about

the possibility of denonstrations by various srougs and inquired

12 the FBI desired to be represented at that meeting. Mr. Evans

replied that the only apparent interest the Federal Government

had in security measures at the convention related to the

protection or the president, who was to attend. since this

responsibility belonged to the Secret Service, Mr, Marshall

was told there appeared to be no reason why the FBi should be

in attendance at the neeting.

The above information is set forth in a memorandum

IrOM NT. Evans TO MY. A. ll. BeLmont, dated June 1, 1904,

captioned "Security Arrangements for the Democratic Convention,"

and is enclosed as Exhibit A to this memorandum.

RE:

REQUEST PERTAINING TO

ELECIRONIC SURVEILLANCI

In July, 1904, the FBI received its first information

indicating possible disruptive activities would occur at the

Atlantic City convention. Between that initial information and

August 21, 1904, there were 19 different occasions when infor

mation regarding planned or possible disruptive activities at

the convention was furnished to the White louse. These possible

disruptive activitles involved the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA);

communist front groups; civil rights groups such as the Congress

of Racial Equality (CORE), Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee (SNCC), National Association for the Advancement of

Colored People (NAACP), the Southeru Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC), and

Committee for Freedom Now; hate groups

Mosque, Inc.; pacitist groups; and hoodluns.

furnished the

White llouse covered a wide scope of subversive,

racial

and hoodlum activities.

Two memoranda from Assistant Director W. C. Sullivan

to Assistant to the Director A. i Belmont, both dated

August 21, 1964, (Exhibits B and C) summarized disruptive

potential and outlined FDI actions to be undertaken to insure

adequate coverago of the DNC.

lighlights of intornation

disseminated to the Wite House were included in those mcmoranda

which also indicated the number of live informants avallable

for the convention,

that technical coverage had been instituted

and that arrangements for local reporting directly fron

Atlantic City to the Bureau had been arranged.

By teletype dated August 20, 1904, captioned

"Disruption of Democratic National Convention, Information

Concorning (Internal Security)" (Exhibit D), all continental

offices were directed to submit a daily teletype regarding any

disruptive activities occurring during course of the convention.

These oîfices were instructed to provide complote informant

coverage of any disruptive activities throughout the convention

period by attempting to arrange to have informants accompany

pertinent individuals or groups to Atlantic City Offices were

also instructed to alert all logical informants so that they

would receive inmediately all infornation concerning activities

or disruptive elements planning travel to Atlantic City. A

follow-up teletype, same caption, dated August 21, 1904,

(Exhibit E) directed that only positive information was desired

and any information of extreme importance of urgency should be

submitted immediately by teletype or telephone to the Bureau.

Except as outllned above, no other instructions have

been located regarding any type of coverage to be provided at

the DNC.

Pertinent information developed was given dissemination

to appropriate Govermment agencies and the White House in accord-

ance with our established procedures regarding dissemination,

which included secret service, Department of Justice and military

intelligence agencies.

SPECIAL SQUAD AT DNC AT ATLANTIC CITX, NOW JERSEY,

AUGUST 22-28, 1904

"The Washington Post," dated January 20, 1975, carried

a front page story by staff writer Ronald Kessler, reporting

that during the 1964 DNC, President Johnson received reports on

key convention delegates fron "wire taps and bugs" installed by

the FBI on civil rights leaders.

This article summarized a 1973

interview with leo I. Clark, former special Agent of the fBi

who retired February I, 1965, as Senior Resident Agent, Atlantic

City, New Jersey.

Clark was quoted as saying information was

reported to President Johnson based on an installation in the

hotel suite of Dr. Martin Luther King and

I a store front used by

Clark allegedly stated that the clectronic

and physical survelllances at the convention were carried out by

an FBI team ordered by the White House and under direct personal

control of Cartha D. Deloach, then an Assistant Director.

RE: EQUEST PERTAINING TO

ELECIRONIC SURVEIILANCE

The above article indicated Clark stated that infor-

mation obtained by the FBI was transmitted to President Johnson

over a telephone llne specifically installed to bypass the

White House switchboard.

Such information included activities

of then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, identities of

Senators and Congressmen visiting King's hotel suite as well as

nominees.

Alter appearance ot above article, the inspection

Division of the

FbI initiated an extensive inquiry into the

entire scope of

FBI activities and investigation during the

DNC of 1904•

The results of this inquiry were set forth in

memoranda of Mr. A. N. Bassett, Assistant Director, Inspection

Division, to Associate Director Callahan, dated January 28

and 29, 1975, and a letterhead memorandum dated January 30, 1975.

These documents were all captioned "Special Squad at Democratic

National Convention (DNC) at Atlantic City, New Jersey,

August 22-28, 1964," and copies are enclosed to this memorandum

Exhibits F, G, and Il, respectively.

In essence the above docunents highlight the

following:

A thorough review of Bureau records, Including

a review of abstracts of Mr. Hoover, Mr, Tolson, Mr. Mohr,

Mx. Belmont, Me, W. C. Sullivan, as well as Ax. Deloach, all

Burcau officials, failod to locate any menorandum or other

document pertaining to a request having been received from

President Johnson or anyone at the White Ilouse instructing the

FBI to afford special coverage of the convention.

The only exception to the above occurred

post-facto, when on July 25, 1973, this

Bureau received the so-called "Sullivan

memoranda" referred to on page two of

Exhibit F. One of the papers comprising

of the FBI by President Johnson. Item 2

cited refers to the DNC of 1904, and a

copy is attached as Exhibit I.

(2) At the time of the convention, lic. Deloach

In this nenorandum,

Nx. Deloach expressed his wish to report the successful

completion of his assignment and accomplishments of the Special

Squad in Atlantic City.

An enclosure to this memorandum con-

tained 13 pages of intelligence data disseminated to Walter

Jenkins at the waite House in iz summaries dated August 24, 25,

26 and 27, 19G4.

the above memorandun and its 4spago enclosure

appear as

by Mr. Hoover dated September 10, 1904, wherein it was reported

on page 3, paragraph 3, of Exhibit J, Mr. DeLoach noted

that thumbnail sketches were prepared on all key dissident groups

Recovery of this information would involve extensive research and

If the Cormittce has need for access

to this intormacion, wo will endeavor to malio it available.

Hovever, it is felt that information obtained during our coverage

of the DNC is essentially set forth in memoranda from lx. Deloach

to Mr. Walter Jenkins (Exhibit K).

Exhibit F, page 8, indicates there were approximately

50 pages of overhears on coverage of King's telephone during the

DNC.

Actually there are 78 pages of logs recording such overhears.

A raview of these handwritten logs indicates several Congressnen,

Senators and State Governors, who were acting in their capacity as

delegates to the convention,

were mentioned and/or overheard.

AlSO

obtained was iniormation relating to seating oi the Mississippi

Freedon Democratic Party.

Should the Committee feel that a review of the above

logs is necessary to substantiate the results set forth in

Mr, Deloach's summaries and reports of FBI Inspection Division,

these logs can bo made available for review on FBI premises by

Senators Frank Church and John G. Tower.

SUBJECT: SPECIAL SQUAD AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY, 8/22 - 28/64

The Washington Post on Sunday, 1/26/75, carried a front page story by

staff writer Ronald Kessler (attached) reporting that during the 1964 Democratic

National Convention, President Johnson received reports on key convention

delegates from "wiretaps and bugs" installed by the FBI on civil rights leacers,

and attributed this information to a Senate Watergate Committee memorandum.

The article summarizes a 1973 interview with Leo T. Clark (EOD as a Special

Agent 1/11/43, retired 2/1/65 as Senior Resident Agent, Atlantic City), and

quotes Clark as saying the information was reported to President Johnson based

on an inctallation in the hotel quite of Dr Martin Tuther Kiro. Ir

• front used by civil rights leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate

Committee that the electronic and physical surveillances at the convention were

carried out by a special FBI team ordered by White House and was under the

personal direction of Cartha D. DeLoach, then an Assistant Director. According

to Clark, the stated purpose of the operation was to gather intelligence on

potential violence or disruption and Clark is reported as stating DeLoach told

him to avoid discussing the operation with the Secret Service.

The news article continues Clark stated most of the information obtained

by the FBI was transmitted to President Johnson over a telephone line specially

installed to bypass the White House switchboard. According to the news article

-Clarl said information furnisned included the activities of then Atturrey General

Robe:t F. Keuredy, identities of Senatas and Congressmen visiting King's

hotel suite as well as persuns seeking support of civil rients leaders, plans of -

delesates so delegations and speculation on Vice-Presidential nominees

Kessler's article states the-authenticity of the Clark memorandum which

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

Kessler's article indicates he has had access to the 1973 Senate Watergate

interview of DeLoach and spells out DeLoach's denial under oath having had a

direct line to President Johnson or laving spoken with the President during the

convention.

Kessler also states one surveillance was conducted as part of a

continuing installation on a person believed to be under the influence of the

Communist Farty which had been approved by Kennedy.

Kessler's article came as no surprise inasmuch as last week DeLoach

and several other retired and current Bureau employees reported they had been

contacted by Kessler for comments concerning the Bureau's operations at the

Democratic National Convention in 1964.

A review of the file of retired SA Clark contains no information that he

was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Committee at any time or has been in

touch with the Bureau in this regard.

APPALINT LEAK CONCERNING FRT DARTICPATION AT

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

file,

consisting of three sections, sets forth numerous communi-

cations from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting forth

pertinent developments. The only information located in Bureau files concerning

the special squad in Atlantic City was an eight-page memorandum (copy attached)

with enclosure located in the file of DeLoach.

This is a memorandum from

DeLoach to Mohr dated 8/29/64 which sets forth that in connection with the

assignment of the special squad in Atlantic City at the direction of the President,

DeLoach wished to report the successful completion of this assignment. He

states that by means oi informant coverage, use of various confidential tech-

niques, infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as roporters, we were able to

keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments. DeLoach also

advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic City with Secret

Service as well as state and local police.

This inomorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther

/ King'and

along with similar coverage esizuleshen on tie lead

quarters or the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) - Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC). DeLoach states he was able to advise the

White House in advance of all plans made by these two sources and coverage

was highly effective. DeLoach advises "with Bureau approval", he instituted

coverage on CORE - SNCC headquarters at their meeting hall and our Negro

undercover agents penetrated the headquarters of the Mississippi Freedom

Democratic Party. (two separate factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi

delegation and yas a highlight of the convention) and through cooperation with the

management of

news our Agents were furnished.

• Press credentials.

- DoLorch reported that 14 pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter

= Jenkins ai the White House and to his memorandum he attached a copy of these

daily summaries dated 8/24, 25, 26, 27/64. These summaries are in effect

a running log öf developinents which took place at the convention. DeLoach also

states he arranged for a leasc line between the control post at Atlantic City and

the Bureau.

thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one of the finest the

President had ever seen. According to this memorandum, Jenkins told AIr.

Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and because of the work

some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly where they were and what

they were doing and consequently they were not able to be very effective. It

should be noted that this particular memorandum of Mir. Hoover's, dated

A thorough review of Bureau records, including a review of abstracts

of Mr. Hoover, Mr. Tolson, Mr. Mohr, as well as Mr. DeLoach, falled to

locate any memorandum or other document pertaining to a request having been

received from President Johnson or anyone at the White fuuse insisuiting

that the FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House and had

a direct line at his residence to the President so it weli may be that this requesi

was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it orally with vIr. Hoover

or Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the request was never put in

writing.

Atlantic City. All knew DeLoach was in charge and he had with him in Atlantic

City three Agents from his office and they were aware that DeLoach was

frequently calling the Bureau reporting developments. Two Agents recalled

DeLoach having a telephone conversation with Walter Jenkins who it is believed

was in Washingion, D. C.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files contain a

memorandum to the Attorney General dated 10/7/63 captioned 'Martin Luther

MateS Seein he ure recommended that it orlene ra acto pirace

a technical surveillance on King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or

at any future address to which he may move. This memorandum was approved

- by Attorney General Kennedy: 10/10/63: A memorandum F. J. Baumgardner

toW. .C. Sullivan, 7/7/64, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question,

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the facilities

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Atlanta. The memo-

" randum observed that the Attorney General has already authorized technical

coverage of the SCLC and King ana additional authority is noi necessary since

this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by additional

telephone service within the SCLC.

Memorandum to Mr. Callahan

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary CORE - SNCC

headquarters in a store on Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of Bureau records

fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization for same. A search of

microphone authorizations in the Newark Office likewise fails to locate any

authorization for this particuiar installation. At the time of the convention in

1964, our authority for microphone surveillance was maintained at the Seat of

Government and authorization for utilizing microphone surveillances was made

by the Director who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell

dated 5/20/54, which recognized FBI authority to institute such surveillances.

By memorandum dated 9/27/65 Attorney General Katzenbach agreed to continue

the use of microphone surveillances oniy following his personal authorization.

It is pointed out that DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic

City mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of SNCC was based on information that an

apparent member of the Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable

activity:

much in a leadershin canacitv in SNCC. Confidential informants

reported that SNCC, among. the various civil rights organizations, was a

principal target for

Communist Party infiltration. At this same period of time

our investigation of CORE was limited to determining whether in fact there was

communist infiltration in that organization. (While a question arises as to the

justification of using a microphone surveillance against CORE per se, it is

noted that we did in fact have a pending investigation on SNCC and the fact SNCC

was engaged in a joint temporary office with CORE during the convention may

well have been justification for installing the microphone surveillance. A review

-.of available material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated 8/22/64 cuncerning the

DATE l7av

January 29, 1975

SUBJECT: SPECIAL SQUAD AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY, 8/22 - 28/64

Reference is made to my previous memorandum captioned as above:

dated 1/28/75 (copy attached). That which follows elaborates somewhat on

various elements of our special coverage of the 1964 Democratic National Con-

vention (DNC) and amplifies certain aspects of our operations therein.

4475

A review of Bureau file

on the Mississippi Freedom Demo-

cratic Party (MFDP) indicates the file was opened to reply to a request from

Walter Jenkins, Special Assistant to President Johnson, for a name check on the

MFDP and certain persons connected therewith. He was advised, "FBI has

never conducted an investigation of the MED and ita files contain no recora

of it." Results of name checks on certain individials were set forth together

• with public source data from the 7/21/64 edition of the Washington Post and

an inquiry made by the Washington Field Office on 7/21/64 at the local office

of the MFDP on general information on its objectives and identity of its staff

members. This information was set forth in a blind memorandum to Mr.

Jenkins dated 7/22/64.

On 8/21/64, responding to a request dated 8/19/64 from Mr. John

Doar of the Civil Rights Division of the Department, memoranda were sent to

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach. Doar had requested name checks on 40

persons in the MFDP leadership and convention delegation members. The

memoranda stated, "This Bureau has not conicted any investigation concerning

the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party nor has it taken any steps to identify

party members."

It should be noted that three civil rights workers who traveled to

Mississippi were discovered missing on 6/22/64 and their automobile found

burned on 6/23/64. On 6/23/64 President Johnson was advised of these facts

and requested tobe kept aware of all aspects of the investigation which had

been requested by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice of the

FBI. The three bodies of these workers were found thereafter on 8/4/64.

On 8/23/64 a flat-bed truck with a burned car on it appeared in Atlantic City,

New Jersey, and it was alleged to be the automobile of the three murdered

civil rights workers in Mississippi. Furthermore, information was received

that the parents of one of these individuals would appear at a rally during the

DNC.

On 8/25/64 Assistant Director Cartha DeLoach telephoned a memorandum

to Mr. Mohr from Atlantic City to the effect information from Walter Jenkins

and informants indicated the question of seating the MFDP delegates was expected

to reach the floor of the DNC the evening of 8/25/64. He said "The crucial point

of the convention in so far as possible violence is concerned will occur between

4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. this afternoon. If the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party is not seated then the unruly elements within the Negro group will possibly

attempt to demonstrate." DeLoach indicated that every effort was being extended

to cover developments pertinent to this possible violent situation.

There follows under appropriate caption in summary form information

relative to our coverage at the DiNC.

COVERAGE RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL CIVIL UNREST,

DEMONSTRATIONS AND POSSIBLE VIOLENCE

A review of the summaries furnished to Walter Jenkins by Mr. DeLoach

during the DNC indicates over 25 separate entries dealing with demonstrations

insofar as their times, places, groups involved, number of participants, and

general nature thereof were concerned. A great majority of the Bureau person-

nel still on active duty who were assigned to this specialsquad in Atlantic City

have indicated that the attaining of intelligence information relative to possible

violent civil disorders was the primary purpose of their efforts during the DNC.

Our coverage in this regard was handled through extensive informant

coverage at Atlantic City and as a result of information received from informants

in other parts of the country as well. Additionally, we utilized Agents in various

undercover capacities to develop such information.

Furthermore, a great deal

of information in this regard was, in fact, received as a result of the technical

coverage utilized. Where appropriate, the information obtained was disseminated

to the U. S. Secret Service and other interested law enforcement agencies as

well.

ACTIVITIES RELATIVE TO THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT

A review of the interviews of the previously mentioned special squad

personnel still on active duty has indicated that a majority of them felt that their

assignment in part was related to the augmenting of the U. S. Secret Service in-

sofar as the protection of the President was concerned. One Agent indicated

that Bureau personnel did, in fact, actively assist in the protection of the

President and his family while they were at the DNC.

A review of Bureau file:

captioned "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)" did not reveal

any information directly relating to the protection of the President.

A review of the DeLoach summaries to Mr. Jenkins indicated one

'instance where a demonstration was planned to take place upon the President's

arrival at convention hall and another incident which revealed a breach of

security which allowed an individual to enter the convention hall and proceed

directly to the podium area. This information was furnished immediately to

the U.S. Secret Service.

Information is contame in the inerviewo d the formei spocial squad

personnel that t'BI Agents were utilized in supplementing U. S. Secret Service

personnel on the convention hall floor.

• INFORMATION DEVELOPED OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE

A further review of the DeLoach summaries revealed approximately

20 separate items which do not appear to relate directly with possible civil

unrest - demonstrations or with the protection of the President.

These items

were developed as a result of the various types of coverage we had at the DNC

but a great number thereof were obtained through our technical coverage. A

sampling of these items includes the following:

1. King planning telegram to the President concerning his undue

influence relative to the seating of the MEDP.

2. Informant information received that Congressman

was carrying a revolver.

3. Informant information relative to National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People planning a meeting at a church.

4. Informant relative to King's speaking before various state delegations.

5. Information that the Congress of Racial Equality headquarters in

Atlantic City was attempting to have Congressman

picketed, claiming he was "shakey."

6. Information that

was inquiring as to who King could

contact to put pressure on the White House. Additionally, there was some talk

of a compromise relative to the questioned seating and of the fact the MFDP

would accept it:

A review of the handwritten technical logs of the coverage on Martin

Luther King at Atlantic City reveals, in addition to some of the items stated

above, considerable information was obtained of the hour-by-hour strategy

followed by King,L

and others in their efforts to seat MFDP in the con-

vention. Mentioned and overheard were several Congressmen, Senators and

Governors of states who were acting in capacity of delegates to the convention.

Also obtained was information that

Tfelt the MFDP group,

iowowing their rejection by the crodentials committee, planned to steal passes

and enter the convention illegally. He was worried about dangerous and ir-

responsible leadership in the group.

Allegations in the press that the coverage of the FBI was used to

follow the activities of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy were not substantiated

in any way by file reviews.

A review of the statements furnished by the special squad personnel

includes various instances where they relate a portion of their overall purpose

was to insure that there was nothing which would "embarrass the President."

One Agent indicated that DeLoach placed emphasis on the fact that the

President did not wish to be embarrassed in any way and that information was

to be gathered which would assure that there would be no such embarrassment.

Two statements were furnished by

in this regard.. One states "I would like to state that at no time did

Tever consider the above to be a political operation but it was obvious that

DeLoach wanted to impress Jenkins and Moyers with the Bureau's ability to

develop information which would be of interest to them" Furthermore, in

response to a question as to whether the Bureau's services were being utilized

for political reasons, -

answered, 'No. I do recall, however, that

on one occasion I was present when DeLoach held a lengthy telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins. Theyappeared to be discussing the President's 'image.'

Pursuant to your request concerning captioned matter, the

Kessler's article states the authenticity of the Clark memo-

randum which cites room numbers of hotel suites bugged and the source

of funds for part oi the operation were verified by persons who either

received it or were present when Clark was interviewed. The article

also states the FBI solicited intelligence through Agents posing as

reporters. According to the article, the memorandum indicates Clark

appeared in response to a subpoena but did not testify under oath.

Kessler's article indicates he has had access to the 1973

Senate Watergate interview of DeLoach and spells out DeLoach's denial

under oath having had a direct line to President Johnson or having

spoken with the President during the convention. Kessler also states

one surveillance was conducted as part of a continuing installation on

a person believed to be under the influence of the Communist Party

which had been approved by kennedy.

Kessler's article came as no surprise inasmuch as last week

DeLoach and several other retired and current Bureau employees

reported they had been contacted by isessier for comments concerning

the Bureau's operations at the Democratic National Convention in 1964.

A review of the personnel file of retired SA Clark contains

no information that he was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Com-

mittee at any time or has been in touch with the Bureau in this regard.

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE "SULLIVAN MEMORANDA"

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate

Watergate Committee, John Dean, on June 27, 1973, testitied and identi-

fied certain documents which he previously had furnished to the Committee.

Among those documents were items referred to during the testimony

as the "Sullivan memoranda, " apparently authored by William C. Sullivan,

former Assistant to the Director, who retired on October 21, 1971.

These typed documents consisted of five separate items and two enva-

lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office Building

marked "Personal" and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret." The first document is headed

we made several recommendations with regard to the contemplated

De Loach advised that he furnished three hours of testimony to Senator

Howard Baker and minority counsel. He advised the testimony was under

the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Dean. DeLoach reported

that Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the

advice and instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he

attempted to answer every question with blunt honesty and Department

Regulation 1622 was utilized only once pertaining to the usage of an

electronic surveillance as authorized by former Attornay General

Kenneay.

REVIEW OF FBI FILES AND RESULTS OF INQUIRY

CONCERNING THIS MATTER

Bureau files show that on August 20, 1984, a teletype was

directed to all continental offices captioned, "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)." This

teletype advises information has been received which indicates subversive

groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and the criminal

element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and the

Bureau must be advised of ail such subversive, criminal, noodlum, and

racial elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period. Other

general instructions were set forth concerning informant availability. A

follow-up instruction was sent out August 21, 1964, that any information

of extreme importance or urgency should be submitted immediately by

teletype or telephone to the Bureau. Our files set forth numerous com-

munications from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting

forth pertinent developments. In a memorandum dated August 29, 1964,

Mr. DeLoach set forth a resume of his assignment with a special squad

of FBI personnel at the Democratic National Convention. DeLoach

reported the successful completion of this assignment. He states that

by means of informant coverage, use of various confidentiai techniques,

intiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were

able to keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments.

DeLoach also advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic

City with Secret Service as well as state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of

Martin Luther King and

along with similar coverage

-i.

established on the headquarters of the Congress of Racial Equality -

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. DeLoach states he was

able to advise the White House in advance of all plans made by these.

two sources and coverage was highly effective. DeLoach advises "with

Bureau approval"' he instituted coverage on the Congress of Racial

Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee headquarters ai

their inceting hall and our Negro undercover agents penetrated the head-

quarters of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (two separate

factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi delegation and was a

_ press credentials. DeLvach

reported that forty-our pages oi intelligence data was disseminated to

Walter Jonkins at the White House and to his memorandum he attached a

copy of these daily summaries dated August 24, 25, 26, 27, 1964. These

summaries are in effect a running log of developments which took place

at the convention. DeLoach also states he arranged for a lease line

(telephone) between the control post at Atlantic City and the Bureau. He

concludes the memorandum by making recommendations that personnel

involved, namely twenty-seven Agents, one radio maintenance technician,

and two stenographers of the Newark Office be commended. Mi. Hoover

noted Deloach should rocoive a meritorious award.

Concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party referred

to above, Bureau recoras show that on August 21, 1954, by letter to then

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach this Bureau responded to a request

dated August 19, 1964, from Mx. John Doar of the Civil Rights Division

of the Department requesing a check of Bureau files for any background

information available concerning persons aftiliated with the Mississippi

Freedom Democratic Party delegation. In furnishing the results of the

name checks to Mir. Katzenbach, he was advised "this Bureau has not

conducted any investigation concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party nor has it taken any steps to identity party members. " Bureau

files also reflect that at the request of Walter Jenkins of the White Housa

stafi we furnished a memorandum dated July 22, 1964, to the White House

setting forth the results of the check of Bureau files concerning the

Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.

In a memorandum dated September 10, 1964, Mr. Hoover

reported Walter W. Jenkins, Special Assistant to the President, called

and stated the Presider wanted Jenkins to call the Director to express

the thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one of the

finest the President had ever seen. According to this memorandum,

- 5 -

WH 55111. DocId: 32989625 Page 50

## Page 51

The Deputy Attorney General

Jenkins told Mr. Hoover there were a lot of bad elements uy thare and

because of the work some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly

where they were and what they were doing and consequently they were

not able to be very effective. It should be noted that this particular

memorandum of Mr. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan's documents

sent to John Dean:

A thorough review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo-

randum or other documents pertaining to a request having been received

from President Johnson or anyone at the White House instructing that the

FBI afford special coverage at the convention.

It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House

and had a direct line at his residence to the President so it well may be

that this request was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it

orally with Mr. Hoover or Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the

request was never put in writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL

STILL ON ACTIVE DUTI

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician

who were involved in the special squad assignment and remain on active

duty with the FBI have confirmed their participation on the squad under

DeLoach's leadership at the convention. These employees advised there

was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

City to-fulfill the FBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not

feel that the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically,

the instructions to the Agents were to develop advance information regard-

ing any acts or intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances

that could arise during the convention as well as secondary protection for

the President. Two of the Agents, both black, were there in undercover

assignment roles. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaison with

Secret service, others were handling the large number of intormants

that we moved into Atlantic City and other Agents were utilized in operating

the technical surveillance on King as well as the microphone installation

installed at the Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating

and he had with him in Atlantic City three Agents from his office and they

were aware that DeLoach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting

developments. Two Agents recalled DeLoach having a telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins who it is believed was in Washington, D. C., at

the time.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE

AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files

contain a memorandum to the Attorney General dated October 7, 1963,

captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr., Security Matter - Communist;

Communist Influence in Racial Matters," wherein the Bureau recom-

mended that authority be granted to place a technical surveillance on

King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or, at any future address

to which he may move. This memorandum was approved by Attorney

General Kennedy, October 10, 1503. A memorandum dated July T

1964, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist

intluence and facial Matters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the

facilities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta.

The memorandum observed that the Attorney General had already

authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since

this is moroly an extension of current coverage brought about by addi-

tional telephone service within the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference.

Another memorandum prepared by an official of the then

Domestic Intelligence Division dated August 24, 1964, and captioned

"Martin Luther King" reports a telephone call from SAC Bachman ai

Newark on August 21, 1964, concerning technical coverage on King in

Atlantic City. Bachman had previously received instructions from a

Division official that he explore the possibility of putting technical and

microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising that a tech-

nical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available at

the hotel concerning a microphone installation. The memorandum

pointed out Bachman was given the go-ahead with the microphone

installation as well as the telephone installation. This memorandum

reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Atorney General to cover

any residences which King may use with a technical installation.

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary

Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonvioleni Coordinating Committee

headquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of

Bureau records fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization

for same. A search of microphone authorizations in the Newark Office

-7-

likewise fails to locate any authorization for this particular installation.

At the time of the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone

surveillance was maintained at the Seat of Government and authoriza

tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Director

who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell dated

May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI authority to institute such sur-

veillances. By memorandum dated September 27, 1965, Attorney

General Katzenbach agreed to continue the use of microphone surveil-

lances only following his personal authorization. It is pointed out that

DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic City

mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committe was based on information that an apparent member of the

Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable activity, much

in a leadership capacity in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

Confidential informants reported that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee, among the various civil rights organizations, was a principal

target for Communist farty infitration. At this same periv of limé our

investigation of the Congress of Racial Equality was limited to deter-

mining whether in fact there was communist infiltration in that organiza-

tion.

(While a question arises as to the justification of using a microphone

surveillance against the Congress of Racial Equality per se, it is noted

that we did in fact have a pending investigation on the Student Nonviolent

•Coordinating Committee and the fact the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of

Racial Equality during the convention may well have been justification

for installing the microphone surveillance. A review of available

material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1964,

concerning the technical surveillance which verifies that the work on

two phones in King's rooms at the hotel had been completed; however,

the personnel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on King in view

of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark files also attribute to

then Senior Resident Agent Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike

should be considered for the temporary Congress of Racial Equality

headquarters at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City. The only other

information contained in Newark files concerning these installations is

a handwritten log consisting of seventy-eight pages of overhears on

King's telephones.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER SY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well

as DeLoach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad

at the convention, some of the Agents utilized media identification of

At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the use of such inves-

tigative technique. On July 2, 1968, instructions were set forth that all

Agent personnel are prohibited to pose as newsmen or representatives

of any wire service for the purpose of establishing an investigative

cover. This rule was invoked after a news item appeared in the

Washington Post on June 18, 1968, alleging that one of our Agents had

posed as a representative of the International News Service while covering

an antidraft demonstration at the Supreme Court on June 17, 1968. The

allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct statement

as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the

demonstration.

COVERAGE OF 1954 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL

CONVENTION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORINIA

Review of Bureau records fails to establish that any specialized

coverage was afforded to the Republican National Convention held in San

Francisco in July, 1964, and the only references in our records relate

to the planning and execution by the Congress of Racial Equality of dem -

onstrations and picketing especially insofar as the nomination of Senator

Barry Goldwater was concerned. Several teletypes and communications

were submitted by San Francisco concerning the demonstrations and

follow-up letterhead memoranda were received by the Bureau and

disseminated.

President Johnson requested the FB I set up a special squad at.

the Comvention to be of assistance to him in various ways. The

"cover" would be that it was a security squad to guard against

militants etc. Nothing of this scope had ever been done before

since to my memory. Included in the assistance redered was the

development of political information useful to President Jo hnson,

On September 10, 1964 Walter Jenkins, Special Assistant to President

Johnson at that time called the FBI and talked to Mr. Hoover. Mr.

Jenkins said "the President wanted him to call, and the President

may have mentioned this himself, but he was not

MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

In connection with the assignment of the special squad to Atlantic City,

New Jersey, 8/22-28/64 at the direction of the President, I wish to report the success:-

completion of this assignment. By means of informant coverage, by use of various

confidential techniques, by infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents:

and through utilization of agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were abie io

keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments during the Convention's

course.

For example, through informant coverage and by controlling the

situation, we were able to prevent a potentially explosive stall-in and sit-in demon-

stration planned by ACT and

( By counseling Messrs. Jenkins, Carter

and Moyers, we convinced them that they must make major changes in controlling

admissions into the Convention Hall and thereby preclude infiltration of the illegal

Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MEDP) delegates in large numbers into the

space reserved for the regular Mississippi delegates. Through our counterintelligence

efforts, Jenkins, et al., were able to advise the President in advance regarding major

plans of the MFDP delegates. The White House considered this of prime importance.

Through our highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther King

together with similar coverage we established on the headquarters of

CORE-SNCC, we were in a position to advise the White House in advance of all plans

made by these two sources in an effort to disrupt the orderly progress of the Conventic--

This coverage was highly effective.

COVERAGE HIGHLIGHTS:

I feel this squad operated very effectively. Squad members averaged

in excess of eight hours overtime daily. They approached eạch assignment as a

challenge and with enthusiasm. The Agents were constantly alert to exploit

opportunities for penetration of key dissident groups in Atlantic. City and to suggest

counter measures for any plans to disrupt the Convention.

Our informant coverage worked particularly well. With Bureau approval.

I instituted coverage similar to that on Kin'

on CORE-SNCC headquarters at

their Atlantic Avenue meeting hall. Our Negro undercover agents successfully

penetrated the headquarters of the MFPD delegation at the Gem Votel and the head-

quarters for their strategy meetings, which was located in the basement of the Union

Baptist Temple Church.

Additionally, we utilized a highly successful cover through cooperation

DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION:

During our Convention coverage, we disseminated 14 pages of

| intelligence data to Walter Jenkins. Attached for your information is a copy of these

I daily summaries. Additionally, I kept Jenkins and Moyers constantly advised by

telephone of minute by minute developments. This enabled them to make spot decisions

and to adjust Convention plans to meet potential problems before serious trouble

developed.

In connection with communications, as you know, we arranged for a

leased line between the Bureau and our control post in Atlantic City. We also

established a private line for exclusive use by our informants.: Appropriate code names

were arranged and informants dispatched from other cities and Newark informants uses

this phone to submit their oral reports. This post was, of course, manned on a

24-hour basis.

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

During the period when the Convention was actually in progress, we

established a secondary command post at the Convention Hall Rotunda operated by an

Agent using his "reporter" cover. As you know, the boardwalk was the center of

agitation by dissident elements. Throughout the course of the Convention, pickets

were active inthe area immediately in front of the Convention Hall entrance. We

necessarily kept these people under close observation.

PRELIMINARY PREPARATION:

Prior to the squad's departure for Atlantic City, we secured all

available pertinent background information on the dissident groups and their leaders

who were expected to be present.

In addition, we took blind memoranda with us which

were prepared and approved prior to our departure.

This proved most helpful. On

, Wednesday morning, Mr. Jenkins urgently requested background information orl

We also prepared thumbnail sketches on all key dissident groups expected

at the Convention and we maintained separate files on the activities of King, Communist

Party groups, area hoodlums, informants, the MFDP and other groups. This was

done in order that we could maintain separate running accounts on each major disruptire

organization which was present.

LIAISON:

On arrival in Atlantic City we immediately established necessary liaison

with the Secret Service, Atlantic City Police Department, New Jersey State Highway

Patrol and with the men directing Convention activities. We also established contacts

withi

to arrange for courier service between the Seat of Government

and our headquarters in Atlantic City.

DAILY COUNTER MEASURES BY SPECIAL SQUAD:

squad in Atlantic City, following is a brief resume of some of the situations which

Monday, August 24, 1964

On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific

Avenue carrying a burned-out car, a huge burlap-wrapped cross and a large church

bell. Rumors swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner,

Goodman and Chaney. Shortly after its appearance this truck was placed on a parking

lot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors

and through police contacis we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned

car through Atlantic City streets.

On Monday, we furnished Mr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of

CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and

initial plans of the MFDP.

Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the Negro racial

groups to establish a silent vigil on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Convention

Hall. This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials

Committee regarding the seating of the MFDP delegates.

Tuesday, August 25, 1964

Jenkins was advised that Martin Luther King had prevailed upon

to come to Atlantic City that day. We alerted White House representatives

regarding compromise proposals for seating of the MFDP and furnished them informatic=

regarding plans of the Progressive Labor Movement groups, ACT and other dissident

organizations. Martin Luther King attempted to arrange a rendezvous with a

Tof Philadelphia. Our sources reported that SNCC and CORE were

attempting to secure tickets to gain entrance to Convention Hall. Through a highly

confidential source, it was learned that CORE and SNCC had been advised that the

President was bringing pressure to bear on the delegates of 15 states to preclude their

support of a move to bring the Mississippi delegates issue to the floor of the Convention.

Wednesday, August 26, 1964

We submitted reports reflecting that the militant members of MFDP

under the leadership ofl

were revolting against the leadership of Martin

Luther King and

We advised Jenkins that the 'MFDP delegates had flatly

rejected the compromise proposal to seat the MFDP delegation. We reported that

We also alerted the White House in advance regarding the telegram prepared

by ACT demanding amnesty for Harlem rioters and for Federal registrars to police

Negro voting in the South.

In consultation with Convention planners, we pointed out serious gaps

in controlling admission to Convention Hall which had permitted entrance of dissident

, elements on the Convention floor. Jenkins immediately placed these recommendations

into effect.

Thursday, August 27, 1964

Wo dotermined Murtin Luckes King and his stold were doperting from

Atlantic City early Thursday morning, and appropriate officials were advised of this.

,We also reported efforts of CORE-SNCC leaders to secure uniforms of the Young

Citizens for Johnson groups and to utilize them for gaining entrance into Convention

Hall. We were able to report that the number of participants of the silent vigil would

dwindle rapidly. Although the demonstrations quieted down Thursday night, we were

heavily involved in checking out the reports that a four-man group of Puerto Rican

terrorists from New York were in Atlantic City in an attempt to assassinate the

President.

MISCELLANEOUS:

For the benefit of the Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative

Divisions, separate memoranda are being submitted regarding infomant coverage. I

am also recommending letters of appreciation to cooperative individuals whose efforts

facilitated the squad's work in Atlantic City.

I told Mr. Marshall that the only apparent interest which

the Federal Government had in the security measures taken at the

convention related to the protection of the President who was to be

in attendance. This responsibility di course velugo to the forent

no FBI interest and no reason why we should attend the meeting

UBJECT: SPECIAL SQUAD AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY, 8/22 - 28/64

The Washington Post on Sunday, 1/26/75, carried a front page story by

staff writer Ronald Kessler (attached) reporting that during the 1964 Democratic

National Convention, President Johnson received reports on key convention

delegates from "wiretaps and bugs" installed by the FBI on civil rights leaders,

and attributed this information to a Senate Watergate Committee memorandum.

' The article summarizes a 1973 interview with Leo I. Clark (EOD as a Special

Agent 1/11/43, retired 2/1/65 as Senior Resident Agent, Atlantic City), and

quotes Clark as saying the information was reported to President Johnson based

front used by civil rights leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate

Committee that the electronic and physical surveillances at the convention were

carried out by a special FBI team ordered by White House and was under the

personal direction of Cartha D. DeLoach, then an Assistant Director. According

to Clark, the stated purpose of the operation was to gather intelligence on

potential violence or disruption and Clark is reported as stating DeLoach told

him to avoid discussing the operation with the Secret Service.

The news article continues Clark stated most of the information obtained

by the FBI was transmitted to President Johnson over a telephone line specially

installed to bypass the White House switchboard. According to the news article.

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

Kessler's article indicates he has had access to the 1973 Senate Watergate

interview of DeLoach and spells out DeLoach's denial under oath having had a

direct line to President Johnson or laving spoken with the President during the

convention. Kessler also states one surveillance was conducted as part of a

continuing installation on a person believed to be under the influence of the

Communist Party which had been approved by Kennedy.

Kessler's article came as no surprise inasmuch as last week DeLoach

and several other retired and current Bureau employees reported they had been

contacted by Kessier for comments concerning the Bureau's operations at the

Democratic National Convention in 1964.

A review of the file of retired SA Clark contains no information that he

was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Committee at any time or has been in

touch with the Bureau in this regard.

and the memorandum had been turned over to

While the

reporters claimed they had not seen copies of the memorandum, DeLoach felt

they knew the contents of the memorandum based on the questions they asked.

Subsequently, DeLoach advised the Bureau that he had received a

subpoena to appear before the Senate Watergate Committee on 10/3/73 and this

subpoena was discussed with the Department with the recommendation that an

appropriate attorney be designated to appear with Mr. DeLoach to represent

the interests of the United States.

By letter to the Director dated 12/7/73, DeLoach advised that he furnished

three hours of testimony to Senator Howard Barker and minority counsel, former

and a stenotypist who was present. He advised the testimony

was under oath and in executive session and the questioning was largely based

on the memorandum furnishon hy Sullivan to John Dean. Delnach reported that

Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the advice and

instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he attempted to

answer every question with blunt honesty and Department Regulation 1622 was

utilized only once pertaining to the usage of an electronic surveillance as au-

the special squad in Atlantic City was an eight-page memorandum (copy attached)

with enclosure located in the file of DeLoach. This is a memorandum from

DeLoach to Mohr dated 8/29/64 which sets forth that in connection with the

assignment of the special squad in Atlantic City at the direction of the President,

DeLoach wished to report the successful completion of this assignment. He

states that by means of informant coverage, use of various confidential tech-

niques, infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were able to

keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments. DeLoach also

advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic City with Secret

Service as well as state and local police.

This incmoraniu refors to highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther

gunsters or the Congrass of Racial quality (CORE) - Student Nonviolent

¡along with simular coverage esiavi shed mi tho led-

Coordinating Committee (SNCC). DeLcach states he was able to advise the

White House in advance of ail plans made by these two sources and coverage

was highly effective. DeLoach advises "with Bureau approval", he instituted

coverage on CORE - SNCC headquarters at their meeting hall and our Negro

undercover agents penetrated the headquarters of the Mississippi Freedom

Democratic Party. (two separate factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi

delegation and yas a highlight of the convention) and through cooperation with the

DoLonch reported that 44 pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter

daily suminaries dated 8/24, 25, 26, 27/64. These summaries are in effect

a running log of developinents which took place at the convention. DeLoach also

states he arranged for a leasc line between the control post at Atlantic City and

the Bureau.

he concludes the memorandum by maling recommendations that

some of the Bureau peopie did they knew exactly where they were and what

they were doing and consequently they were not able to be very effective. It

locate any memorandum or other document pertaining to a request having been

received from President Johnson or anyone at tne While fuust insisuiting

that the FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House and had

a, direct line at his residence to the President so it well may be that this request

was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it orally with vIr. Hoover

the convention as well as secondary protection for the President. . Two of the

Agents, both black, were there in undercover assignment roles. Certain

Agents had responsibility for liaison with Secret Service, others were handling

the large number of informants that we moved into Atlantic City and other

Agents were utilized in operating the technical surveillance on King as well

as the microphone installation installed at CORE - SNCC headquarters in

Atlantic City. All knew DeLoach was in charge and he had with him in Atlantic

City three Agents from his office and they were aware that DeLoach was

frequently calling the Bureau reporting developments. Two Agents recalled

DeLoach having a telephone conversation with Walier Jenkins who it is believed

was in Washington, D. C.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files contain a

memorandum to the Attorney General dated 10/7/63 captioned 'Martin Luther

Matiers, " Suurity Mister - Comminist: Communist iriluence in Racial

wherein the Bureau recommended that authority be grantea to piace

a technical surveillance on King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or

at any future address to which he may move. This memorandum was approved

by Attorney General Kennedy: 10/10/63. A memorandum F. J. Baumgardner

to W. C. Sullivan, 7/7/64, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question,

Communist Influence and Racial Matters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the facilities

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Atlanta. The memo-

" randum observed that the Attorney General has already authorized technical

coverage of the SCLC and King and additional authority is noi necessary since

this is merely an extension oi current coverage brought about by additional

that a technical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available

Memorandum to Mr. Callahan

Re: Special Squad at-Democratic National Convention

• Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary CORE - SNCC

headquarters in a store on Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of Bureau records

fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization for same. A search of

microphone authorizations in the Newark Office likewise fails to locate any

authorization for this particular installation. At the time of the convention in

1964, our authority for microphone surveillance was maintained at the Seat of

Government and authorization for utilizing microphone surveillances was made

by the Director who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell

dated 5/20/54, which recognized FBI authority to institute such surveillances.

By memorandum dated 9/27/65 Attorney General Katzenbach agreed to continue

the use of microphone surveillances only following his personal authorization.

It is pointed out that DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic

City mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of SNCC was based on information that an

apparent member of the Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable

activity: much in a leadershin capacitv in SNCC. Confidential informants

reported that SNCC, among. the various civil rights organizations, was a

principal target for Communist Party infiltration. At this same period of time

our investigation of CORE was limited to determining whether in fact there was

communist infiltration in that organization. (While a question arises as to the

justification of using a microphone surveillance against CORE per se, it is

noted that we did in fact have a pending investigation on SNCC and the

fact SNCC

was engaged in a joint temporary office with CORE curing the convention may

well have been justification for installing the microphone surveillance. A review

FROM : H. N. BASSETT

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: SPECIAL SQUAD AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY, 8/22 - 28/64

Reference is made to my previous memorandum captioned as above,

dated 1/28/75 (copy attached). That which follows elaborates somewhat on

various elements of our special coverage of the 1964 Democratic National Con-

vention (DNC) and amplifies certain aspects of our operations therein.

A review of Bureau file

-C8==1

on the Mississippi Freedom Demo-

cratic Party (MFDP) indicates the file was opened to reply to a request from

Walter Jenkins, Special Assistant to President Johnson, for a name check on the

MFDP and certain persons connected therewith. He was advised, "FBI has

never conducted an investigation of the MaDe and its files contain no recoid

of it. " Results of name checks on certain individials were set forth together

• with public source data from the 7/21/64 edition of the Washington Post and

an inquiry made by the Washington Field Office on 7/21/64 at the local office

ofthe MFDP on general information on its objectives and identity of its staff

members. This information was set forth in a blind memorandum to Mr.

Jenkins dated 7/22/64.

On 8/21/64, responding to a request dated 8/19/64 from Mr. John

Doar of the Civil Rights Division of the Department, memoranda were sent to

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach. Doar had requested name checks on 40

persons in the MFDP leadership and convention delegation members. The

memoranda stated, "This Bureau has not coxicted any investigation concerning

the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party nor has it taken any steps to identify

party members. "

•It should be noted that three civil rights workers who traveled to

Mississippi were discovered missing on 6/22/64 and their automobile found

burned on 6/23/64. On 6/23/64 President Johnson was advised of these facts

and requested tobe kept aware of all aspects of the investigation which had

been requested by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice of the

FBI. The three bodies of these workers were found thereafter on 8/4/64.

"On 8/23/64 a flat-bed"trück with a burned car on it appeared in Atlantic City,

civil rights workers in Mississippi. Furthermore, information was received

that the parents of one of these individuals would appear at a rally during the

DNC.

On 8/25/64 Assistant Director Cartha DeLoach telephoned a memorandum

to Mr. Mohr from Atlantic City to the effect information from Walter Jenkins

and informants indicated the question of seating the MFDP delegates was expected

to reach the floor of the DNC the evening of 8/25/64. He said "The crucial point

of the convention in so far as possible violence is concerned will occur between

4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. this afternoon. If the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party is not seated then the unruly elements within the Negro group will possibly

attempt to demonstrate." DeLoach indicated that every effort was being extended

to cover developments pertinent to this possible violent situation.

There follows under appropriate caption in summary form information

reiative to our coverage ai the DNC.

COVERAGE RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL CIVIL UNREST,

DEMONSTRATIONS AND POSSIBLE VIOLENCE

A review of the summaries furnished to Walter Jenkins by Mr. DeLoach

during the DNC indicates over 25 separate entries dealing with demonstrations

insofar as their times, places, groups involved, number of participants, and

general nature thereof were concerned. A great majority of the Bureau person-

nel still on active duty who were assigned to this specialsquad in Atlantic City

have indicated that the attaining of intelligence information relative to possible

violent civil disorders was the primary purpose of their efforts during the DNC.

Our coverage in this regard was handled through extensive informant

coverage at Atlantic City and as a result of information received from informants

in other parts of the country as well.

Additionally, we utilized Agents in various

undercover capacities to develop such information.

Furthermore, a great deal

of information in this regard was, in fact, received as a result of the technical

coverage utilized. Where appropriate, the information obtained was disseminated

to the U. S. Secret Service and other interested law enforcement agencies as

well.

ACTIVITIES RELATIVE TO THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT

A review of the interviews of the previously mentioned special squad

personnel still on active duty has indicated that a majority of them felt that their

assignment in part was related to the augmenting of the U. S. Secret Service in-

sofar as the protection of the President was concerned. One Agent indicated

that Bureau personnel did, in fact, actively assist in the protection of the

President and his family while they were at the DNC.

A review of Bureau file:

captioned

"Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal 'Security)" did not reveal

any information directly relating to the protection of the President.

A review of the DeLoach summaries to Mr. Jenkins indicated one

instance where a demonstration was planned to take place upon the President's

arrival at convention hall and another incident which revealed a breach of

security which allowed an individual to enter the convention hall and proceed

directly to the podium area. This information was furnished immediately to

the U. S. Secret Service.

Information is contained in the interviews vi the iomei special squad

personnel that FBI Agents were utilized in supplementing U. S. Secret Service

personnel on the convention hall floor.

• INFORMATION DEVELOPED OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE

A further review of the DeLoach summaries revealed approximately

20 separate items which do not appear to relate directly with possible civil

unrest - demonstrations or with the protection of the President. These items

were developed as a result of the various types of coverage we had at the DNC

but a great number thereof were obtained through our technical coverage. A

sampling of these items includes the following:

1. King planning telegram to the President concerning his undue

influence relative to the seating of the MFDP.

2. Informant information received that Congressman

was carrying a revolver.

3. Informant information relative to National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People planning a meeting at a church.

4. Informant relative to King's speaking before various state delegations.

6. Information that

was inquiring as to who King could

contact to put pressure on the White House. Additionally, there was some talk

of a compromise relative to the questioned seating and'of the fact the MFDP

would accept it:

A review of the handwritten technical logs of the coverage on Martin

Luther King at Atlantic City reveals, in addition to some of the items stated

above, considerable information was obtained of the hour-by-hour strategy

followed by King,L

Tand others in their efforts to seat MFDP in the con-

vention. Mentioned and overheard were several Congressmen, Senators and

Governors of states who were acting in capacity of delegates to the convention.

Also obtained was information that

(felt the MfDe group,

following their rejection by the credertials committee, planned to steal passes

and enter the convention illegally. He was worried about dangerous and ir-

responsible leadership in the group.

Allegations in the press that the coverage of the FBI was used to

follow the activities of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy were not substantiated

in any way by file reviews.

A review of the statements furnished by the special squad personnel

includes various instances where they relate a portion of their overall purpose

was to insure that there was nothing which would "embarrass the President."

One Agent indicated that DeLoach placed emphasis on the fact that the

President did not wish to be embarrassed in any way and that information was

to be gathered which would assure that there would be no such embarrassment.

Iwo statements were furnished by:

in this regard. One states "I would like to state that at no time did

Tever consider the above to be a political operation but it was obvious that

DeLoach wanted to impress Jenkins and Moyers with the Bureau's ability to

develop information which would be of interest to them" Furthermore, in

response to a question as to whether the Bureau's services were being utilized

for political reasons, -

answered, "No. I do recall, however, that

on one occasion I was present when DeLoach held a lengthy telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins. Theyappeared to be discussing the President's 'image.'

In addition to the summary memoranda furnished by DeLoach to

Mr. Jenkins, information is contained in Bureau file

Kessler's article states the authenticity of the Clark memo

randum which cites room numbers of hotel suites bugged and the source

of funds for part of the operation were verified by persons who either

received it or were present when Clark was interviewed. The article

also states the FBI solicited intelligence through Agents posing as

reporters. According to the article, the memorandum indicates Clark

appeared in response to a subpoena but did not testily under oath.

Kessler's article indicates he has had access to the 1973

Senate Watergate interview of DeLoach and spells' out DeLoach's denial

under

oath having had a direct line to President Johnson or having

spoken with the President during the convention. Kessler also states

one surveillance was conducted as part of a continuing installation on

a person believed to be under the influence of the Communist Party

which had been approved by Kennedy.

Kessler's article came as no surprise inasmuch as last week

DeLoach and several other retired and current Bureau employees

reported they had been contacted by Ressier for comments concerning

the Bureau's operations at the Democratic National Convention in 1964.

A review of the personnel file of retired SA Clark contains

no information that he was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Com-

mittee at any time or has been in touch with the Bureau in this regard.

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE 'SULLIVAN MEMORANDA"

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate

Watergate Committee, John Dean, on June 27, 1973, testified and ideni-

fied certain documents which he previously had furnished to the Committee.

Among those documents were items referred to during the testimony

as the "Sullivan memoranda," apparently authored by William C. Sullivan,

former Assistant to the Director, who retired on October 21, 1971.

These typed documents consisted of five separate items and two enva-

lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office Building

marked "Personal"' and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret." The first document is headed

Committee on Presidential Activities on October 3, 1973. In this letter

we made several recommendations with regard to the contemplated

testimony by DeLoach. By letter to me dated December 7, 1973,

DeLoach advised that he furnished three hours of testimony to Senator

Howard Baker and minority counsel. He advised the testimony was under

the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Dean. DeLoach reported

that Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the

advice and instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he

attempted to answer every question with blunt honesty and Department

Regulation 1622 was utilized only once pertaiing to the usage of an

electronic surveillance as authorized by former Attorney General

Kennedy.

REVIEW OF FBI FILES AND RESULTS OF INQUIRY

CONCERNING THIS MATTER

Bureau files show that on August 20, 1964, a teletype was

directed to all continental offices captioned, "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)." This

teletype advises information has been received which indicates subversive

groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and the criminal

element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and the

Bureau must be advised of all such subversive, criminal, hoodlum, and

racial elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period.

Other

general instructions were set forth concerning informant availability. A

follow-up instruction was sent out August 21, 196k, that any information

of extreme importance or urgency should be submitted immediately by

teletype or telephone to the Bureau. Our files set forth numerous com-

munications from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting

forth pertinent developments. In a memorandum dated August 29, 1964,

Mr. DeLoach set forth a resume of his assignment with a special squad

•of FBI personnel at the Democratic National Convention. DeLoach

reported the successful completion of this assignment. He states that

by means of informant coverage, use of various confidential techniques,

infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were

able to keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments.

DeLoach also advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic

City with Secret Service as well as state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of

Martin Luther King and

along with similar coverage

established on the headquarters of the Congress of Racial Equality -

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Commitiee. DeLoach states he vas

able to advise the White House in advance of all plans made by these.

their meeting hall and our Negro undercover agents penetrated the head-

quarters of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (wo separate

factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi delegation and was a

reported that forty-tour pages of intelligence data was disseminated to

Walter Jonkins at the White House and to his memorandum he attached a

copy of these daily summaries dated August 24, 25, 26, 27, 1964. These

summaries are in effect a running log of developments which took place

at the convention. DeLoach also states he arranged for a lease line

(telephone) between the control post at Atlantic City and the Bureau. He

concludes the memorandum by making recommendations that personnel

involved, namely twenty-seven Agents, one radio maintenance technician,

and two stenographers of the Newark Office be commended. Mr. Hoover

noted Deloach should receive a meritorious aword.

Concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party referred

to above, Bureau records show that on August 21, 1954, by leiter to then

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach this Bureau responded to a request

dated August 19, 1964, from Mr. John Doar of the Civil Rights Division

of the Department requesting a check of Bureau files for any background

information available concerning persons affiliated with the Mississippi

Freedom Democratic Party delegation. In furnishing the results of the

name checks to Vir. Katzenbach, he was advised "this Bureau has not

conducted any investigation concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party nor has it taken any steps to identily party members." Bureau

files also reflect that at the request of Walter Jenkins of the White Flousa

staîf we furnished a memorandum dated July 24, 190k, to the White mouse

setting forth the results of the check of Bureau tiles concerning the

Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.

In a memorandum dated September 10, 1964, Mr. Hoover

reported Walter W. Jenkins, Special Assistant to the President, callea

and stated the Presidert wanted Jenkins to call the Director to express

the thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one of the

finest the President had ever seen. According to this memorandum,

The Deputy Attorney General

Jenkins told Mr. Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and

because of the work some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly

where they were and what they were doing and consequently they were

not able to be very eifective. It should be noted that this particular

memorandum of Mr. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan's documents

sent to John Dean:

A thorough review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo-

randum or other documents pertaining to a request having been received

from President Johnson or anyone at the White House instructing that the

FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House

and had a direct line at his residene to the President so it well may be

that this request was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it

orally with Mr. Hoover or Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the

request was never put in writing.

STATEMENTS CE SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL

STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician

who were involved in the special squad assignment and remain on active

duty with the FBI have confirmed their participation on the squad under

DeLoach's leadership at the convention. These employees advised there

was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

City to-fulfill the FBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not

feel that the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically,

the instructions to the Agents were to develop advance information regard-

ing any acts or intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances

that could arise during the convention as well as secondary protection for

the President. Two of the Agents, both black, were there in undercover

assignment roles. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaison with

Secret Service, others were handling the large number of informants

that we moved into Atlantic City and other Agents were utilized in operating

the technical surveillance on King as well as the microphone installation

installed at the Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee headquarters in Atlantic City. All knew DeLoach was in charge

and he had with him in Atlantic City three Agents from his office and they

were aware that DeLoach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting

developments. Two Agents recalled DeLoach having a telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins who it is believed was in Washington, D. C., at

the time.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE

AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files

contain a memorandum to the Attorney General dated Ociober 7, 1963,

captioned 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Security Matter - Communist;

Communist Influence in Racial Matters," wherein the Bureau recom-

mended that authority be granted to place a technical surveillance on

King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or, at any luture address

to which he may move. This memorandum was approved by Attorney

General Kennedy, October 10, 1963. A memorandum dated July 7,

1964, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist

Influence and Racial Matters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the

facilities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta.

The memorandum observed that the Attorney General had already

authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since

this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by addi-

tional telephone service within the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference.

Another memorandum prepared by an official of the then

Domestic Intelligence Division dated August 24, 1964, and captioned

"Martin Luther King" reports a telephone call from SAC Bachman at

Newark on August 21, 1964, concerning technical coverage on King in

Atlantic City. Bachman had previously received instructions from a

Division official that he explore the possibility of putting technical and

microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising that a tech-

nical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available at

the hotel concerning a microphone installation. The memorandum

pointed out Bachman was given the go-ahead with the microphone

installation as well as the telephone installation. This memorandum

reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Attorney General to cover

any residences which King may use with a technical installation.

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary

Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

headquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of

Bureau records fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization

for same. A search of microphone authorizations in the Newark Office

likewise fails to locate any authorization for this particular installation.

At the time of the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone

surveillance was maintained at the Seat of Government and authoriza-

tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Director

who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell dated

May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI authority to institute such sur-

veillances. By memorandum dated September 27, 1965, Attorney

General Katzenbach agreed to continue the use of microphone surveil-

lances only following his personal authorization. It is pointed out that

DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic City

mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committe was based on information that an apparent member of the

Committee, among the various civil rights organizations, was a principal

target for Communist Party titration. At this same perivi vi tune vur

investigation of the Congress of Racial Equality was limited to deter-

mining whether in fact there was communist infiltration in that organiza-

tion. (While a question arises as to the justification of using a microphone

surveillance against the Congress of Racial Equality per se, it is noted

that we did in fact have a pending investigation on the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee and the fact the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of

Racial Equality during the convention may well have been justification

for installing the microphone surveillance. A review of available

material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1964,

concerning the technical surveillance which verifies that the work on

two phones in King's rooms at the hotel had been completed; however,

the personnel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on King in view

of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark files also attribute to

then Senior Resident Agent Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike

should be considered for the temporary Congress of Racial Equality

headquarters at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City. The only other

information contained in Newark files concerning these installations is

a handwritten log consisting of seventy-eight pages of overhears on

King's telephones.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER BY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well

as DeLoach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad

at the convention, some of the Agents utilized media identification ofl

At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the use of such inves-

tigative technique. On July 2, 1968, instructions were set forth that all

Agent personnel are prohibited to pose as newsmen or representatives

of any wire service for the purpose of establishing an investigative

cover. This rule was invoked after a news item appeared in the

Washington Post on June 18, 1968, alleging that one of our Agents had

posed as a representative of the International News Service while covering

an antidraft demonstration at the Supreme Court on June 17, 1968. The

allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct statement

as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the

demonstration.

COVERAGE OF 1954 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL

CONVENTION, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFOPINIA

Review of Bureau records fails to establish that any specialized

coverage was afforded to the Republican National Convention held in San

Fxancisco in July, 1964, and the only references in our records relate.

to the planning and execution by the Congress of Racial Equality of dem-

onstrations and picketing especially insofar as the nomination of Senator

Barry Goldwater was concerned. Several teletypes and communications

were submitted by San Francisco concerning the demonstrations and

follow-up letterhead memoranda were received by the Bureau and

disseminated.

challenge and with enthusiasm. The Agents were constantly alert to exploit

opportunities for penetration of key dissident groups in Atlantic City and to suggest

counter measures for any plans to disrupt the Convention.

Our informant coverage worked particularly well. With Bureau approval.

I instituted coverage similar to that on Kin-

quarters for their strategy meetings, which was located in the basement of the Union

and to adjust Convention plans to meet potential problems before serious trouble

developed.

In connection with communications, as you know, we arranged for a

leased line between the Bureau and our control post in Atlantic City. We also

established a private line for exclusive use by our informants.: Appropriate code name:

this phone to submit their oral reports. This post was, of course, manned on a

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

During the period when the Convention was actually in progress, we

established a secondary command post at the Convention Hall Rotunda operated by an

Agent using his "reporter" cover. As you know, the boardwalk was the center of

agitation by dissident elements. Throughout the course of the Convention, pickets

were active inthe area immediately in front of the Convention Hall entrance. We

necessarily kept these people under close observation.

PRELIMINARY PREPARATION:

Prior to the squad's departure for Atlantic City, we secured all

available pertinent background information on the dissident groups and their leaders

who were expected to be present. In addition, we took blind memoranda with us which

were prepared and approved prior to our departure. This proved most helpiul. On

, Wednesday morning, Mr. Jenkins urgently requested background information on

We also prepared thumbnail sketches on all key dissident groups expected

at the Convention and we maintained separate files on the activities of King, Communist

Party groups, area hoodlums, informants, the MFDP and other groups. This was

done in order that we could maintain separate running accounts on each major disruptive

organization which was present.

LIAISON:

On arrival in Atlantic City we immediately established necessary liaison

with the Secret Service,.

Atlantic City Police Department, New Jersey State Highway

Patrol and with the men directing Corvention activities.

We also established contacts

Monday, August 24, 1954

On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific

Avenue carrying a burned-out car, a huge burlap wrapped cross and a large church

bell. Rumors swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner.

Goodman and Chaney. Shortly after its appearance this truck was placed on a parking

lot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors

and through police contacts we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned

car through Atlantic City streets.

On Monday, we furnished Mr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of

CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and

initial plans of the MEDI.

Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the Negro racial

groups to establish a silent vigil on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Convention

Hall. This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials

Committee regarding the seating of the MEDe delegates.

Tuesday, August 25, 1964

Jenkins was advised that Martin Luther King had prevailed uponl

to come to Atlantic City that day. We alerted White House representatives

regarding compromise proposals for seating of the MFDP and furnished them informatio

regarding plans of the Progressive Labor Movement groups, ACT and other dissident

organizations. Martin Luther King attempted to arrange a rendezvous with a

'of Philadelphia. Our sources reported that SNCC and CORk were

attempting to secure tickets to gain entrance to Convention Hall. Through a highly

confidential source, it was learned that CORE and SNCC had been advised that the

President was bringing pressure to bear on the delegates of 15 states to preclude their

support of a move to bring the Mississippi delegates issue to the floor of the Convention.

Wednesday, August 26, 1964

We also alerted the White House in advance regarding the telegram prepared

by ACT demanding amnesty for Harlem rioters and for Federal registrars to police

Negro voting in the South.

In consultation with Convention planners, we pointed out serious gaps

in controlling admission to Convention Hall which had permitted entrance of dissident

, elements on the Convention floor. Jenkins immediately placed these recommendations

into effect.

Wo actermined Martin inher ling and bie otos wore doparting from

We also reported efforts of CORE-SNCC leaders to secure uniforms of the Young

Citizens for Johnson groups and to utilize them for gaining entrance into Convention

Hall. We were able to report that the number of participants of the silent vigil would

dwindle rapidly. Although the demonstrations quieted down Thursday night, we were

heavily involved in checking out the reports that a four-man group of Puerto Rican

terrorists from New York were in Atlantic City in an attempt to assassinate the

President.

For the benefit of the Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative

SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION

Mr. Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights Division tele-

phoned. He advised that he had received a call from Louis Martin

of the Democratic National Committee who advised that a meeting

is to be held at 4:00 p.m., today at the Convention Manager's Oilice

at Atlantic City to discuss Security Arrangements ior the Democratic

National Convention. Those in charge oi the convention are said to

be concerned about the possibility or demonstrations by civil rights

groups and others. Mr. Martin stated to Mr: Marshall that he

would certainly want to invite the FBI to participate in this meeting

if this would be appropriate. Marshall inquired as to whether we

would like to attend.

I told Mr. Marshall that the only apparent interest which

the Federal Government had in the security measures taken at the

curvention related in the protection of the President who was to be

in attendance.

This responsibility of course melimys to the Secret

Service. In addition, Mr. Marshall was told there appeared to be

no FBI interest and no reason why we should attend the meeting

today.

Marshall said he fully understood that only the Secret

Service had a direct interest in this matter and that organization

would be invited to have representatives at the meeting.

connections with groups planning demonstrations or other activity

at Convention.

We have alerted nationwide all logical security,

racial, criminal and hoodlum informants to report immediately per-

tinent

information coming to their attention concerning possible

disruptive activities.

We have 72 informants in New Jersey and

surrounding states available to move into Atlantic City on short

notice on selective basis if needed to supplement existing coverage.

We have arranged for local reporting procedure directly

from Atlantic City Resident Agency to Bureau officials on daily basis

so intormation can be channeled immediately to White House officials

as received.

Our coverage of the CPUSA indicates that the Party plans

to send James Jackson,

CPUSA national functionary and

Editor of "The Worker," east coast communist newspaper,

and Michael Davidow,

CPUSA New York District functionary

and staff member of

"The Worker," to the Comention as

official representatives of "The Worker."

These Party newspapermen undoubtedly will highly propa-

gandize a picketing demonstration which the communists

plan to stage at the scene of the Convention through the

newly formed CP youth organization, the W. E. B. DuBois

Clubs of America.

Informants have advised that Jarvis

Tyner, East Coast Regional Coordinator of the DuBois

clubs, has chartered two buses to bring pickets from

Philadelp, ceansylvania, to Atlantic City on 3, 25/64

to picket the morning and

afternoon sessions of the Cor.

vention on that date.

Informanis of our Newark Office also have advised that

the New cersey Chapter of the Dubois Clubs plans to

demonscrate at the Democratic National Convention on

8/26/64.

We have informant coverage in both these groups going to

the Convention.

(b) Communist Front Activity

Fxank Wilkinson, Executive Director and Field Representa-

tive of the National Committee to Abolish the House Un-

American Activities Committee, a communist front, plans

to be in Atlantic City during

the Convention.

Wilkinson,

a known former member of the CP, intends to distribute

copies of the pamphlet "HUAC, Bulwark of Segregation" to

delegates at the Convention.

On 8/4/64 Annette Provinzano, Administrative Secretary of

the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born,

another communist front, visited Senator Wayne Morse of

Oregon to obtain the procedure by which that organization

hopes to address the Democratic Convention to urge a

are unsuccessiul in testifying before the Convention

Platform Committee, will distribute literature to

the Committee.

2. Racial

(a) Congress of Racial Equality;

Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

Our coverage of racial groups to date indicates that

for all intents and purposes CORE and SNCC have joined

forces and have planned demonstrations during the

Democratic National Convention. CORE has opened head-

quarters in Atlantic City.

They plan a large demonstra-

tion on 8/26/64 with possible help from the Chester,

Pennsylvania, Committee for Freedom Now, as well as

ACT, two other all-Negro civil rights groups.

Lewis

, Field secretary of CORE, wili be in chaigo of

this demonstration which could involve as many as 300

demonstrators.

James Farmer, CORE Director, has pledged militant ano

aiscipLined demonstrations at the convention if the

Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates are not

seated when the Convention opens.

Eugene

Journour, a current CP member Irom st. Louis,

Missour, has been engaged in coRE activities in chicago

and plans to lead a national task force of CORE from

that

area for a proposed demonstration at the Convention.

Another current CP member, Sargeant Caulfield of the CP

District in louisiana, has been attending CORE meetings

men bers

in his state and was one of three persons elected to

attend the Democratic National Nominating Convention.

The Convention will be asked to recognize these three

individuals as delegates.

Sixty members of the SNCC from Jackson, Mississippi, plan

to attend the Convention to assist in seating the Mississippi

Freedom Democratic Party delegation.

This group reportedly

will utilize walkie-talkies in connection with their planned

demonstrations.

and upstate New York membership, is also in Atlantic City

with his son-in-law, Joseph V. Laduca, another Buffalo

racket figure and a member of La Cosa

RE:

DISRUPTION OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

FBI Coverage

As indicated above, ve have for a period of nearly two months

been disseminating pertinent information concerning certain groups

or individuals who plan to picket,

demonstrate or otherwise disrupt

the Democratic National Convention to the White House on a continuing

basis.

I. Policy

To insure this continuing and intensified coverage of

disruptive efforts on the part oi individuals or groups

planning to attend the Convention we have instructed all

of our continental offices to submit a daily teletype

with information of this nature until the Convention

concludes:

• These offices have diso been instructed to

make every effort to provide complete informant coverage

of such activities throughout the Convention period by

attempting to arrange to have informants accompany the

individuals or the groups planning to go to Atlantic City.

Any such informants recommended to go will do so, of course,

only with Bureau approval.

In addition, all

field offices

have been instructed to alert

all logical

security, racial, top hoodlum, and criminal

informants in their respective localities

so as to receive

immediately all information which these informants might

obtain concerning the activities of their respective group

representatives while they are in Atlantic City.

Specifically, the Newark, New York, Philadelphia, and

have been instructed to consider,

and to nave available it the need arises, logical security,

racial, top hoodlum, and criminal informants who may be

sent to Atlantic City upon Bureau approval where a unique

situation may arise which would necessitate their presence

there.

2.

Informant Coverage

At the present time the Newark field office already has

on the scene in Atlantic City a total of 39 informants and

potential informants in a position to furnish pertinent

-8-

HH 55111 DooId:32989625 Page 214

## Page 215

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE:

DISRUPTION OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

iniormation concerning developments there. These individuals

are in a position to furnish a variety of information concerning

security, racial, top hoodlum and criminal matters. In addition

to this,

the Newark Office has 135 sources of information in the

State who can furnish information concerning general criminal

activities, prostitution, gambling, hotel registrations and

other matters of interest in this category.

In connection with the planned travel of the communist youth

groups, one of which is going to Atlantic City Irom Philadelphia

and the other of which is going from Newark, we have penetrated

both of these groups and will have live informant coverage of

their activities on a daily basis throughout the Convention

period.

In the event it is doomsd zocossary and edvisable, we have

available a total of 72 informants from our New York, Newark,

Philadelphia and Baltimore field offices who could be sent

into Atlantic City.

These sources are capable of obtaining

and reporting information in all types of activities, including

racial agitation, criminal activities on the part of top

hoodlums and general criminal activities as well as security

activity among subversive groups and hate groups.

3. Coverage Other Than Live Informants

In addition to the live informant coverage we will have in

Atlantic City, we also have extensive technical and microphone

surveillances on key individuals and organizations in their

home states such as:

Nathan Schwerner - parent of Michael Schwerner, murdered

Mississippi civil rights worker

Martin Luther King, Jr. - (In addition to coverage on

King in other areas, we are

also arranging to have technical

coverage on King in Atlantic City.)

Directer SiST

The Washington Post on Sunday, 1/26/75, carried a front page story by

siaff writer Ronald Kessler (attached) reporting that during the 1954 Democratic

National Convention, President Johnson received reports on key convention

delegates from "wiretaps and bugs" installed by the FBI on civil rights leaders;

and attributed this information to a Senate Watergate Committee memorandum.

The article summarizes a 1973 interview with Leo T. Clark (EOD as a Special

Agent 1/11/43, retired 2/1/65 as Senior Resident Agent, Atlantic City), and

quotes Clark as saying the information was reported to President Johnson based

en an inctallatin in the hotel suite nf Dr. Martin Luther King: Jr.: and a Store

front used by civil rights leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate

Committee inui the electronic and physical surveillances at the convention were

. carried out by a special FBI team ordered by White House and was under the

personal direction of Cartha D. DeLoach, then an Assistant Director. According

to Clark, the stated purpose of the operation was to gather intelligence on

potential violence or disruption and Clark is reported as stating Deloach told

him to avoid discussing the operation with the Secret Service.

The news article continues Clark stated most of the information obtained

by the FBI was

transmitted to President Johnson over a telephone line specially

installed to bypass the White House switchboard.

interview of DeLoach and spells out DeLoach's denial under oath having had a

direct line to President Johnson or laving spoken with the President during the

convention. Kessler also states one surveillance was conducted as part of a

continuing installation on a person believed to be under the influence of the

Communist Party which had been approved by Kennedy.

Kessler's article came as no surprise inasmuch as last week DeLoach

and several other retired and current Bureau employees reported they had been

contacted by Kessler for comments concerning the Bureau's operations at the

Democratic National Convention in 1964.

A review of the file of retired SA Clark contains no information that he

was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Committee at any time or has been in

touch with the Bureau in this regard.

APPARENT LEAK CONCERNING FBI PARTICIPATION AT

1964 CONVENTION

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate Watergate Com-

mittee, John Dean, on 6/27/73, testified and identified certain documents

which he previously had furnished to the committee. Among those documents

were items referred to during the testimony as the "Sullivan Memoranda" which

were not admitted into evidence by Chairman Sam Ervin. Subsequent contact

• with the Deputy Chief Counset of the committee determined the committee had

no intention of releasing the Sullivan Memoranda or even publishing them with

the committee reports. The counselstated he would dis euss with the chairman

Feathe possibility of making a copy of the Sullivan Memoranda available to the EBI.

Hearst Publications, who claimed they knew that Sillivan had given John Dean

a memorandum alleging FBI political assistance to the Johnson Administration

and the memorandum had been turned over to the Ervin Committee. While the

reporters claimed they had not seen copies of the memorandum, De Loach felt

they knew the contents of the memorandum based on the questions they asked.

Subsequently, De Loach advised the Bureau that he had received a

subpoena to appear before the Senate Watergate Committee on 10/3/73 and this

subpoena was discussed with the Department with the recommendation that an

appropriate attorney be designated to appear with Mr. DeLoach to represent

the interests of the United States.

By letter to the Director dated 12/7/73, DeLoach advised that he furnished

three hours of testimony to Senator Howard Barker and minority counsel, former

SA Donaid Sinders and a stenotypist who was present. He advised the testimony

was under oath and in executive session and the questioning was largely based

on the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Dean. DeLnach reported that

Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the advice and

instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he attempted to

answer every question with blunt honesty and Department Regulation 1622 was

utilized only once pertaining to the usage of an electronic surveillance as au-

thoriza by former Attorney General Kennedy.

DeLoach was subsequently interviewed by the Watergate Special Prosecution

force in about January, 1974. However, according to SA angelo Iano of

Washington Field Office, De loach's testimony in this regard pertained to the IT.

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

file, 100-442527, consisting of three sections, sets forth numerous communi-

cations from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting forth

pertinent developments.

The only information located in Bureau files concerning

the special squad in Atlantic City was an eight-page memorandum (copy attached)

with enclosure located in the file of DeLoach.

This is a memorandum from

DeLoach to Mohr dated 8/29/64 which sets forth that in connection with the

assignment of the special squad in Atlantic City at the direction of the President,

DeLoach wished to report the successful completion of this assignment. He

states that by means o informant coverage, use of various confidential tech-

niques, infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were able to

keep the White House fully apprised of all major deveiopments. DeLoach also

advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic City with Secret

Service as well as state and local police.

This momoranum refers to highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther

/ KingJand Bayard Rustin] along with similar coverage establishied in tho leza-

quaitors of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) - Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Deloach states he was ahle to advise the

White House in advance of ail plans made by these two sources and coverage

was highly effective. DeLoach advises "with Bureau approval" he instituted

coverage on CURE - SNCC headquarters at their meeting hall and our Negro

undercover agents penetrated the headquarters of the Mississippi Freedom

Democratic Party. (two separate factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi

delegation and yas a highlight of the convention) and through cooperation with the

management of BEnews our Agents were furnished N30 press credentials.

• DeLorch reported that 14 pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter

¿ Jenkins at the White House and to his memorandum he attached a copy of these

daily summaries dated 8/24, 25, 26, 27/64. These summaries are in effect

a running log of developinents which took place at the convention. DeLoach also

states he arranged for a lease line between the control post at Atlantic City and

the Bureau.

He concludes the memorandum-by mating recommendations thal

two stenographers of the Newark Office be commended. Mr. Hoover noted

thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one of the finest the

President had ever seen. According to this memorandum, Jenkins told Mr.

Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and because of the work

some of the Bureau peopie did they knew exactly where they were and what

they were doing and consequently they were not able to be very effective. It

should be noted that this particular memorandum of Mr. Hoover's, dated

10/10/64, is referred to in Sullivan's documents sent to John Dean and Sullivan

not only refers to the correct date of this memorandum and Jenkins' call to

Mr. Hoover but Sullivan quotes a portion of the wording of this memorandum

setting the wording in quoies which would idicate that Sullivan may well have

an unauthorized coyy of this particular memorandum and took it with him as

well as other information when he retired in 1971. This apparent action by

Sullivan could possibly constitute a vioiation of the Theit of Government Property

Statute (Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 641);

A thorough review of Bureau records, including a review of abstracts

of Mr. Hoover, Mr. Tolson, Mr. Mohr, as well as Mr. DeLoach, failed to

locate any memorandum or other document pertaining to a request having been

received from President Johnson or anyone at the While fuuse instructing •

that the FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was resyonsible for liaison with the White House and had

a direct line at his residence to the President so it well may be that this request

was made directly to Del.oach who in turn discussed it orally with Mr. Hoover

or Mr. Toison but for one reason or another the request was never put in

writing.

the convention as well as secondary protection for the President.. Two of the

Agents, both black, were there in undercover assignment roles. Certain

Agents had responsibility for liaison with Secret Service, others were handling

the large number of informants that we moved into Atlantic City and other

Agents were utilized in operating the technical surveillance on King as well

as the microphone installation installed at CORE - SNCC headquarters in

Atlantic City. All knew DeLoach was in charge and he had with him in Atlantic

City three Agents from his office and they were aware that DeLoach was

frequently calling the Bureau reporting developments. Two Agents recalled

DeLoach having a telephone conversation with Walter Jenkins who it is believed

was in Washington, D. C.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files contain a

memorandum to the Attorney General dated 10/7/63 captioned 'Martin Luther

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the facilities

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Atlanta. The memo-

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary CORE - SNCC

headquarters in a store on Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of Bureau records

fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization for same. A search of

microphone authorizations in the Newark Office likewise fails to locate any

authorization for this particuiar installation. At the time of the convention in

1964, our authority for microphone surveillance was maintained at the Seat of

Government and authorization ior utilizing microphone surveillances was made

:. by the Director who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell

dated 5/20/54, which recognized FBI authority to institute such surveillances.

By memorandum dated 9/27/65 Attorney General Katzenbach agreed to continue

the use of microphone surveillances only following his personal authorization.

It is pointed out that DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic

City mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of SNCC was based on information that an

apparent member of the Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable

activity: much in a leadership capacity in SNCC. Confidential informants

reported that SNCC, among the various civil rights organizations, was a

principal target for Communist Party infiltration. At this same period of time

our investigation of CORE was limited to determining whether in fact there was

communist infliration in that organization. (While a question arises as to the

justification of using a microphone surveillance against CORE per se, it is

noted that we did in fact have a pending investigation on SNCC and the fact SNCC

was engaged in a joint temporary office with CORE during the convention may

well have been justification for installing the microphone surveillance. A review

-of available material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.J-.

received instructions that DeLoach while in Atlantic City would handle all com-

munications with the Bureau directly from Atlantic City rather than relaying

intormation to the Newark Ofice. Enempsen recalls that Bachman was un-

happy at being cut out by DeLoach because Bachman was being queried by

W. C. Sullivan as to what was going on in Atlantic City and, of course, he could

not furnish such information to Sullivan when DeLoach was dealing directly with

the Bureau.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER BY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well as

DeLoach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad at the

convention, some of the Agents tilized media identification of the Natient

At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the

Director ses's -

Reference is made to my previous memorandum captioned as above:

dated 1/28/75 (copy attached). That which follows elaborates somewhat on

various elements of our special coverage of the 1964 Democratic National Con-

vention (DNC) and amplifies certain aspects of our operations therein.

A review of Bureau file 620409555 on the Mississippi Freedom Demo-

cratic Parly (MFDP) indicates the file was opened to reply to a request from

Walter Jenkins, Special Assistant to President Johnson, for a name check on the

MFDI and certain persons connected therewith. He was advised, "FBI has

never conducted an investigation of the MEDP and its files contain no reenid

of it. " Results of name checks m certain individials were set forth together

• with public source data from the 7/21/64 edition of the Washington Post and

an inquiry made by the Washingion FieldOffice on 7/21/64 at the local office

ofthe MEDP on general information on its objectives and identity of its stali

members. This information was set forth in a blind memorandum to Mr.

Jenkins dated 7/22/64.

On 8/21/64, responding to a request dated 8/19/64 from Mr. John

Doar of the Civil Rights Division of the Department, memoranda were sent to

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach. Doar had requested name checks on 40

persons in the MFDP leadership and convention delegation members. The

memoranda stated, "This Bureau has not corted any investigation concerning

the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party nor has it taken any steps to identify

party members."

It should be noted that three civil rights workers who traveled to

Mississippi were discovered missing on 6/22/64 and their automobile found

burned on 6/23/64. On 6/23/64 President Johnson was advised of these facts

and requested tobe kept aware of all aspects of the investigation which had

been requested by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice of the

FBI. The three bodies of these workers were found thereafter on 8/4/64.

On 8/23/64 a flat-bed truck with a burned car on it appeared in Atlantic City,

New Jersey, and it was alleged to be the automobie of the three murdered

civil rights workers in Mississippi. Furthermore, information was received

that the parents of one of these individuals would appear at a rally during the

DNC.

On 8/25/64 Assistant Director Cartha DeLoach telephoned a memorandum

to Mr. Mohr from Atlantic City to the effect information from Walter Jenkins

and informants indicated the question of seating the MFDP delegates was expected

to reach the floor of the DNC the evening of 8/25/64. He said "The crucial point

of the convention in so far as possible violence is concerned will occur between

4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. this afternoon. If the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party is not seated then the unruly elements within the Negro group will possibly

attempt to demonstrate." DeLoach indicated that every effort was being extended

to cover developments pertinent to this possible violent situation.

There follows under appropriate caption in summary form information

relative to our coverage at the DNC.

COVERACE RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL CIVIL UNREST.

DEMONSTRATIONS AND POSSIBLE VIOLENCE

A review of the summaries furnished to Walter Jenkins by Mr. DeLoach

during the DNC indicates over 25 separate entries dealing witt: demonstrations

insofar as their times, places, groups involved, number of participants, and

general nature thereof were concerned. A great majority of the Bureau person-

nel still on active duty who were assigned to this special squad in Atlantic City

have indicated that the attaining of intelligence information relative to possible

violent civil disorders was the primary purpose of their efforts during the DNC.

Our coverage in this regard was handled through extensive informant

coverage at Atlantic City and as a result of intormation received from informants

in other parts of the country as well. Additionally, we utilized Agents in various

• undercover capacities to develop such information.

Furthermore, a great deal

of information in this regard was, in fact, received as a result of the technical

coverage utilized. Where appropriate, the information obtained was disseminated

to the U. S. Secret Service and other interested law enforcement agencies as

well.

ACTIVITIES RELATIVE TO THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT

personnel still on active duty has indicated that a majority of them felt that their

assignment in part was related to the augmenting of the U. S. Secret Service in-

sofar as the protection of the President was concerned. One Agent indicated

that Bureau personnel did, in fact, actively assist in the protection of the

President and his family while they were at the DNC.

A review of Bureau file 100-442527 captioned "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)" did not reveal

any information directly relating to the protection of the President.

A review of the DeLoach summaries to Mr. Jenkins indicated one

instance where a demonstration was planned to take place upon the President's

arrival at convention hall and another incident which revealed a breach of

security which allowed an individual to enter the convention hall and proceed

directly to the podium area. This information was furnished immediately to

the U.S. Secret Service.

information is contained in the interviews of ine iormer speciai squaa

personnel that FBI Agents were utilized in supplementing U. S. Secret Service

personnel on the convention hall floor.

INFORMATION DEVELOPED OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE

A further review of the DeLoach summaries revealed approximately

20 separate items which do not appear to relate directly with possible civil

unrest - demonstrations or with the protection of the President. These items

were developed as a result of the various types of coverage we had at the DNC

but a great number thereof were obtained through our technical coverage. A

sampling of these items includes the following:

1. King planning telegram to the President concerning his undue

influence relative to the seating of the MEDP.

2. Informant information received that Congressman/Adem Clayten

Fewell was carrying a revolver:

3. Informant information relative to National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People planning a meeting at a church.

4. Informant relative to King's speaking before various state delegations.

Luther King at Atlantic City reveals, in addition to some of the items stated

above, considerable information was obtained of the hour-by-hour strategy

followed by King, Rusting and others in their efforts to seat MFDP in the con-

vention. Mentioned and overheard were several Congressmen, Senators and

Governors of states who were acting in capacity of delegates to the convention.

Also obtained was information that Bayard Rustin felt the MFDP group,

following their rejection by the credentials committee, planned to steal passes

and enter the convention illegally. He was worried about dangerous and ir-

responsible leadership in the group.

Allegations in the press that the coverage of the FBI was used to

follow the activities of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy were not substantiated

in any way by file reviews.

A review of the statements furnished by the special squad personnel

includes various instances where they relate a portion of their overall purpose

was to insure that there was nothing which would 'embarrass the President."

One Agent indicated that DeLoach placed emphasis on the fact that the

President did not wish to be embarrassed in any way and that information was

to be gathered which would assure that there would be no such embarrassment.

Two statements were furnished by Bill D. Williame present SACkin

Kansas-City. in this regard. One states "I would like to state that at no time did

I ever consider the above to be a political operation but it was obvious that

DeLoach wanted to impress Jenkins and Moyers with the Bureau's ability to

develop information which would be of interest to them" Furthermore, in

response to a question as to whether the Bureau's services were being utilized

for political reasons, Williams answered, "No. I do recall, however, that

on one occasion I was present when DeLoach held a lengthy telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins. Theyappeared to be discussing the President's 'image.'

SPECIAL SQUAD AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

ATLANTIC CITT, NEW JERSEY

AUGUST 22 - 28, 1964

Pursuant to your request concerning captioned matter, the

Washington Post on Sunday, January 26, 1975, carried a front page

story by stati writer Ronald Kassier reporting that during the 1964

Democratic National Convention, Eresident Jobnson received reports

on key convention dejegates from "wirataps and bugs" installed by

the I'Bi on civil rights leaders, and attributed this information to a

Senate Watergate Committee memorandum. The article summarizes

a 1973 interview by the Committee with Leo T. Clark who on his

retirement on February 1, 1965, was the Senior Resident Agent al

Atlantic City. Kessler quotes Clark as saying the informacion was

reported to President Johnson based on an installation in the hotel

suite Di Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and a storeiront used by civil

rights leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate Committee

that the electronic and physical surreillances at the convention were

carried out by a special FBI team ordered by the White House and was

under the personal direction of Cartha :D, DeLoach, then an Assistant

Director. According to Clars, the stated purpose of the operation was

to gather intelligence on potential violence or disruption and Clars is

reported as stating DeLoach told him to avoid discussing the operation.

with the Secret Service.

The news article continues Clark stated most of the informa-

tion ebtained by the #'3l was transmitted to President Jchnson ever a

telephone line specially installed to bypass the White House switchboard.

According to the news article, Clark said intormation furnished included

the activities of then Attorney General Robert I. Kennedy, identities de

Senators and Congressmen visiting King's hotel suite as well as persons

saeking support of civil rights leaders, plans oi delegates or delegations

and speculation oa Vice Presidential nominees.

aiso states the FBI solicited intelligence through Agents posing as

reporters. Accoraing to the aracle, Le memorandum mdicates Slak

Kessleris article indicates he has had access to the 1973

Senate Watergate interview of DeLoach and speils out DeLoach'e denial

under oath having had a direct line to President Johnson or having

spoken with the President during the convention. Kessier also stales

one surveillance was conducted as part of a continuing installation on

a person believed to be under the influence of the Communist Party

which had been approved by Kennedy.

A review of the personnel file of retired SA Claris contains

no information that he was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Com-.

comittee at any time or has been in touch with the Bureau in this regard.

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE "SULLIVAN MEMORANDA"

in connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate

Watergate Committee, John Dean, on June 27, 1973, testified and identi-

fied certain documents which he previously had furnished to the Committee.

Among those documents were items referred to during the testimony

as the "Sullivan memoranda, " apparently authored by Willlam C. Sullivan,

former Assistant to the Director, who retired on October 21, 1971.

These typed documents consisted of five separate items and two enve

lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office Building

marked "Personal" and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words

"yes-enty" and lseeret." The first document is headed

"President Johnson, Politics of the FBI." This one-page document

concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on ITovember 12,

1968, for the FBI to check all outgoing telephone calls made by the then

Vice Presidential cancidate, Mir. Spiro Agnaw, on the date of November 2,

1963; when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This document

states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.m., November 13, 1968, to

ask about the progress he FBi was making in this matter. (This matter

pertains to the Mrs. Claire Chennault matter.) A second itera concerns

an alleged request by Maryin Waisen on February 18, 1966, for the FBI

to cover Senata Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page

indicates President Jobnson asked the F'9l to determine it Republicans

were involved in instigating a riot in New York.

The second document consists of one typewritten page labeled

Woo Seeret" and the heading "Preface" and is a general recitation o

alleged F3I involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far

exceeded Roosevelt in using the FBI for pelitical purposes

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI,"

15 marked "Top Secret," and consists of three pages. It cites ten alleged

incidents di misuse pi the FBI by President Johuson as follows: (1) Re:

Mrs. Claire Chemault and Embassy bi South Vietnam; #) Re: Democratic

National Convention Atlantic Cily, 1964; (3) Re: Dou Reyaolds (a per-

sonality in the Bobby Baker case); (4) Re: Democratic Convention 1968;

(5) Re: Walter W. Jenkins; (6) Re: Walter Jenkins; (7) Re: Mrs. Claire

Chennaul, Embassy of South Vietnam; (8) Fe: Senator Barry Goldwater;

(9) Re: George Reedy; (10) Re: Walter Jenkins.

The fourth document reads as follows: "John, Please see the

enclosure the contents of which are seli-explanatory. It I am to type

any coservations mysel please be tolerant of my poor typing, Bill."

The flith document bears a marking "Secret" re "Watérgata."

This is an offer on the part of Sullivan to testify before the Watergata

Committee in behalf of the Administration and by doing so could put the

current (Nizon) Administration in a very favorable light.

in my letter daied October 2, 1973, to then Deputy Attorney

Genaral, captioned "Cartha D. Deloach, Subpoena by Select Committee

on Presidential Activities" the Department was advised that My. DeLoach

had received a subpoena calling for his appearance before the select

Committee on Presidential Activities on Oetober 3, 1973. In this letter

we made several recommendatione with regard to the contemplated

testimony by Deloach. By letter to me dated December 7, 1973,

DeLoach advised that he furnished three hours of testimony to Senator

Howard Baker and minority counsel.. He advised the testimony was under

the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Desa.

De Loach re parted

that Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the

advice and instractions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he

attempted to answer every question with blunt henesty and Department

Regulation 1622 was utiltzed only once pertaining to the usage of an

electronia surveillance as authorized by former Attorney General Kennedy.

REVEW OF FBI TILES AND RESULTS OF INQUIRY

CONCERNING THES MATTER

Bureau files show that on August 20, 1964, a teletype was

directed to all continental offices captioned, 'Disruption of Democratie

Nadonal Convendor, Information Concerning (Internal Security). " This

teletype advises information has been received which indicates subversive

groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and the criminal

element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and the

Bureau must be advised of all such subversive, criminal, hoodlum, and

raciai elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period.

offices were adyised the Bureau was not interested in purely political

activity engaged in by delagates and others officially attending the conventien.

Other general instructions were set forth concerning informant availability. A

follow-up instruction was sent out August 21, 1904, that any information

of extreme importance or urgency should be submitted immediately by

telebyce or telephone to the Bureau. Our Mllea set forth numerous com

muntcacions from the feid as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting

forth pertinent developments. In a memorandum dated August 29, 196%,

Mr. DeLoach set forth a resume of his assignment with à special squad

of FBI personnel at the Démocratic National Convention. DeLoach

reported the suecessful completion is this assigament.

He states that

by me ans oi informant coverage, use of various confidential techniques,

infiltration of key groups through use of undercoyer agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were

able to keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments.

DeLoach aiso advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic

City with Secret Serylce as well aa state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of

Martin Luther King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar soverage

established on the headguarters of the Congress of Racial Equality -

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, DeLoach states he was

able to advise she White House in advance of all plans made by these

two sources and coverage was highly effective.. De Loach advises "with

Bureau approval" he instituted coverage on the Congress of Racial

Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee headquarters at

their meeting ball and our Negro undercover agents penetrated the head-

quarters of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (two separate

Jacãons were contesting seats for the Mississippi delegation and was a

highlight of the convention) and through cooperation of news media our

Agents were furnished press credentials. Deloach reported that forty

four pages of intelligence dala was disseminated to Walter Jenkins at the

White House and to his mem randum he attached a copy of these daily

summaries dated August 24, 25, 26,

and 27, 1964. These summaries are

in effect a running log of developments which took place at the convention.

De Loach also states he arranged for a lease line (telephone) between the

centzol post at Atlantie City and the Bureau. He concludes the memorandum

by making recommendations that personnel involved, namely twenty-seven Agent

one radio maintenance technician, and two stenographers of the Newark Office

be commended. Mr. Hoover noted De Loach should receive à meritorious

award.

Concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratie Party referred

to above, Bureau records show that on August 21, 1954, by letter to then

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach this Bureau responded to a request

daied August 19, 1964, from Mr. John Doar of the Civil Rights Division

of the Bepartment requesting a check of Bureau files lot any baciground

information available concerning persons aifiliated with the Mississippi

freedom Democratic Party delegation. In furnishing the results of the

name checks to Mr. Raizenback, he was advised "his Bureau has aot

conducted any investigation concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratie

Party nor has it taken any steps to identily party membess. " Bureau

files also reflect that at the request of Walter Jenkins of the White House

stalt we furniahed a memorandum dated July 22, 1964, to the White House

setting forth the results of the check of Bureau files concerning the

Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.

In a memörandura dated September 10, 1964, Me. Hoover

reported Walter W. Jenkins, Special Assistant to the President, called.

and stated the President wanted Jenkins to call the Director to express

the thought the job the Bureau bad done in Atlantic City was one of the

Arest the Freaident had ever seen. According to this memorandum;

The Deputy Attorney General

Jenkins toid Vir. Hoover there were 2 lot of bad elements up there and

because of the work some of the Bureau people did they knew exacily

where they were and what they were doing and consequently they were

not able to be vary effective. It should be noted that this particular

memorandum of Vir. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan'e documents

sent to John Deat

A thorough review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo-

randum or other documents pertaining to a request having been received

from President Johnson or anyone at she White House instructing that the

FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House

and had a direct line at his residese to the President so it well may be

that this request was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it

orally with Vr. Hoover or Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the

request was never pat in writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL

STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY.

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician

who were involved in the special squad assignment and remain on active

duty with the FBI have contirmed their participation on the squad under

DeLoach's leadership ai the convention. These employees advised there

was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

City to fulfill the FBl's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not

feel thai the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically,

the instructions to the Agents were to develop advance information regardi

ing any acts or intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances

that could arise during the convention as well as secondary protaction for

the President.

Iwo of the Agents, both black, were there in undercover

assignment roles. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaison with

Secret Service, sthers were handling the large number of informants

that we moved into Atlantic Clty and other Agents were utilized in operating

the technical suzveillance on King as well as the microphone installation

installed at to Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinzting

Committee headquarters in Atlantic City. All knew DeLoaeh was in charge

and be had with him in Atlantic City three Agents fror his otfice and they

ware aware that Deloach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting

developments. Two Agents recalled Deleach having a telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins who it is believed was in Washingion, D. Cr, at

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE

AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical Installation on King, Bureau files

contal a memorandium to the Attorney General datad Detober 7, 1963,

captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr. y Security Matter - Communist;

Communist Influence in Racial Matters," wherein the Bureau recom-

mended that authority be granted to place a technical surveillance on

King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or at any future address

to which he may move. This memorandum was approved by Attorney

Ceneral Kennedy, October 10, 1963. A memorandum daied July 7,

1964, captioned "Coromunist Party, USA, Negro Question, Commmis

Influence and Racial Maiters - IS - C," partains to a request by the

Atlanta Citice to install threa additional technical surveillances on the

facilities oi the Southern Christian Leadership Confarence in Atlanta.

The memorandum observed that the Attorney Ceneral had already

authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadersbip

Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since.

fais is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by addi

tional telephone service within the Southern Christian Leadership

Comerenes.

Another memorandum prepared by an official of the then

Domestic ntelligence Division dated August 25, 1964, and captioned.

"Diartin Luther King"' reports a telephone call from SAC Bachman at

Newark on August 21, 1964, concerning technical coverage on King in

Atlantic City. Bachman had previously received instructims from a

Division ofticial that he explore the possibility of putting technical and

microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising that a tech-

nical installation could be done and reliable contacts wera available at

the hotel concerning a microphone instaliation. The memorandum

pointed out Bachman was given the go-abead with the microphone

installation as well as the telephone installation. This memorandusa

reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Attorney Genezal to cover

any residences which Ring may use with a technical installation.

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary

Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

headquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, a thorough reyiew of

Bureau records falls to locate any memorandum containing authorization-

for same. A searca of microphone authorizations in the Newark Office

The Deputy Attorney General

Mewise fails to locate any authorization for this particular installation.

At the time of the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone

suryeillance was maintained at the Seat of Government and authoriza

tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Director

who relied on a memorandum irom. Attoruey General Brownell dated

May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI authority to institute such sur-

velllances. By memorandm dated Septembar 27, 1965, Attorney

General Katzenbach agreed te continue the use of microphone surveil

lances only following his personal authorization. It is pointed out that

DeLoach's memorandur reporting the coverage at Atlantic City

mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of the Student Nonviolent Ccordinating

Commitie was based on information that an apparent member pi the

Commanist Party, USA, was engaging in considerabls acitrity, much

in a leadership capacity in the Stadent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

Confidential informants reported that the Stadent Noniolent Coordinating

Committee, among the various civit rights organizations, was a principal

target for Communist Party indiltration, At this same peried of time cur

investigation ef the Congress of Racial Equality was limited to deter-

mining whether in fact there was communist infiltration in that organiza-

tion. (While a question arises as to the justification of using a microphone

surveillance against the Congress of Racial Equality per se, it is noted

that we did in fact have a bending investigation on the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee and the fact the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of

Racial Equality during the convention may well have been justification

for installing the microphone surveillance. A review of available

material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark flles contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1964,

conceming the technical surveillance which verifies that the works on

two phones in King's rooms at the hotel had been completed; however,

the personnel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on King in view

of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark flles also attributa te

then Senior Resident Agent Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike

shorid be considered for the temporary Congress of Racial Equality

headquarters at 1414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City. The only other

information contained in Newark illes concerning these installations is

a handwritten log consisting of seventy-eight pages of overhears on

King's telepnones.

UTTLIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER SY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well

as DeLeach's memorandura, reporting the activities of the special squad

at the convention, some of the Agents utllized media identification of NBC.

Ai that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the use of such inves

tigative technique. On July%, 1968, instructions were set forth that all

Agent personnel are prohibited to pose as newsmen or representatives

Di any wire service for the purpose of establishing an investigative

cover. This rule was invoked aîter a news item appearet in the

Washington Post on Jure 18, 1968, alleging that one of our Agents had

posed as a representative of the International News Service while covering

an antidrait demonsiration at the Supreme Court on June 17, 1958. The

allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct statement

as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the

demonsiration.

MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

Glouch, Ce The De

In connection with the assignment of the special squad to Atlantic City,

New Jersey, 8/22-28/64 at the direction of the President, I wish to report the successful

completion of this assignment. By means of informant coverage, by use of various

confidential techniques, by infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents,

and through utilization of agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were able to

keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments during the Convention's

course.

For example, through informant coverage and by controlling the

situation, we were able to prevent a potentially explosive stall-in and sit-in demon-

stration planned by ACT and Dick Gregory. By counseling Messrs. Jenkins, Carter

and Moyers, we convinced them that they must make major changes in controlling

admissions into the Convention Hall and thereby preclude infiltration of the illegal

Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) delegates in large numbers into the

space reserved for the regular Mississippi delegates.

Through our counterintelligence

efforts,

Jenkins, et al., were able to advise the President in advance regarding major

plans of the MFDP delegates. The White House considered this of prime importance.

Through our highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther King and

Bayard Rustin, together with similar coverage we established on the headquarters of

CORE-SNCC, we were in a position to advise the White House in advance of all plans

made by these two sources in an effort to disrupt the orderly progress of the Convention.

This coverage was highly effective.

challenge and with enthusiasm. The Agents were constantly alert to exploit

opportunities for penetration of key dissident groups in Atlantic City and to suggest

counter measures for any plans to disrupt the Convention.

Our informant coverage worked particularly well. With Bureau approval,

I instituted coverage similar to that on King and Rustin on CORE-SNCC headquarters at

their Atlantic Avenue meeting hall. Our Negro undercover agents successfully

penetrated the headquarters of the MFPD delegation at the Gem Motel and the head-

quarters for their strategy meetings, which was located in the basement of the Union

Baptist Temple Church.

Additionally, we utilized a highly successful cover through cooperation

of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Robert Northshield, manager of news

• for NBC and a long-time, well-established contact of my office, furnished us NBC

credentials. I selected several of the members of the squad to utilize this cover.

•As ân campli, one of our "roportors" was able to gain the confidence of Aaron

Henry, Robert Moses, James Farmer, Dick Gregory and Jesse Gray, the notorious

Harlem riot leader. Our "reporter" was so successful, in fact, that Henry was giving

him "off the record information" for background purposes, which he requested our

"reporter" not to print.

One of our Negro undercover agents successfully established contact

with Dick Gregory Saturday night, August 22nd, and maintained this relationship

throughout the course of the entire Convention. By midweek, he had become one of

Gregory's confidants. This, of course, proved to be a highly valuable source of

| intelligence since Gregory was constantly trying to incite racial groups to violence.

DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION:

During our Convention coverage, we disseminated 44 pages of

• intelligence data to Walter Jenkins. Attached for your information is a copy of these

I daily summaries. Additionally, I kept Jenkins and Moyers constantly advised by

telephone of minute by minute developments. This enabled them to make spot decisions

and to adjust Convention plans to meet potential problems before serious trouble

developed.

In connection with communications, as you know, we arranged for a

leased line between the Bureau and our control post in Atlantic City. We also

established a private line for exclusive use by our informants. Appropriate code names

were arranged and informants dispatched from other cities and Newark informants used

this phone to submit their oral reports. This post was, of course, manned on a

24-hour basis.

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

During the period when the Convention was actually in progress, we

established a secondary command post at the Convention Hall Rotunda operated by an

Agent using his "reporter" cover. As you know, the boardwalk was the center of

agitation by dissident elements. Throughout the course of the Convention, pickets

were active inthe area immediately in front of the Convention Hall entrance. We

necessarily kept these people under close observation.

PRELIMINARY PREPARATION:

Prior to the squad*s departure for Atlantic City, we secured all

available pertinent background information on the dissident groups and their leaders

who were expected to be present. In addition, we took blind memoranda with us which

were prepared and approved prior to our departure. This proved most helpful. On

Wednesday morning, Mr. Jenkins urgently requested background information on Robert

Moses. COFO leader who had emerged as the leader of the militant gron within the

MFDP delegation. The White House also requested a blind memorandum on

Dr. Aaron Henry, Chairman of this group. Within 15 minutes of the request, the

desired blind memoranda were furnished to Jenkins. He was highly pleased and said

this was of vital importance to their operation. (Henry as you will recall has an arrest

I record for perversion.)

We also prepared thumbnail sketches on all key dissident groups expected

at the Convention and we maintained separate files on the activities of King, Communist

Party groups, area hoodlums, informants, the MFDP and other groups. This was

done in order that we could maintain separate running accounts on each major disruptive

organization which was present.

LIAISON:

On arrival in Atlantic City we immediately established necessary liaison

with the Secret Service, Atlantic City Police Department, New Jersey State Highway

Patrol and with the men directing Convention activities.

We also established contacts

with Allegheny Airlines to arrange for courier service between the Seat of Government

and our headquarters in Atlantic City.

DAILY COUNTER MEASURES BY SPECIAL SQUAD:

As an example of the type of problems encountered by this special

squad in Atlantic City, following is a brief resume of some of the situations which

developed during the Convention:

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

Monday, August 24, 1964

On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific

Avenue carrying a burned-out car, a huge burlap-wrapped cross and a large church

bell. Rumors swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner,

Goodman and Chaney. Shortly after its appearance this truck was placed on a parking

lot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors

l and through police contacts we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned

car through Atlantic City streets.

On Monday, we furnished Mr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of

CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and

initial

plans of the MEDP.

Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the Negro racial

groups to establish a silent vigil on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Convention

Hall. This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials

Committee regarding the seating of the MFDP delegates.

Tuesday, August 25. 1964

Jenkins was advised that Martin Luther King had prevailed upon Bayard

Rustin to come to Atlantic City that day. We alerted White House representatives

regarding compromise proposals for seating of the MFDP and furnished them information

regarding plans of the Progressive Labor Movement groups, ACT and other dissident

organizations. Martin Luther King attempted to arrange a rendezvous with a

Mrs. Jackson of Philadelphia. Our sources reported that SNCC and CORE were

attempting to secure tickets to gain entrance to Convention Hall. Through a highly

confidential source, it was learned that CORE and SNCC had been advised that the

President was bringing pressure to bear on the delegates of 15 states to preclude their

support of a move to bring the Mississippi delegates issue to the floor of the Convention.

Wednesday, August 26, 1964

We submitted reports reflecting that the militant members of MFDP

under the leadership of Robert Moses were revolting against the leadership of Martin

Luther King and Aaron Henry. We advised Jenkins that the MFDP delegates had flatly

rejected the compromise proposal to seat the MFDP delegation. We reported that

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

Dick Gregory, through ACT, was attempting to promote a stall-in to block access to

Convention Hall. One of our key informants was instructed by Gregory to plan this

demonstration and through our control of him we were able to completely thwart

Gregory. We also alerted the White House in advance regarding the telegram prepared

by ACT demanding amnesty for Harlem rioters and for Federal registrars to police

Negro voting in the South.

In consultation with Convention planners, we pointed out serious gaps

in controlling admission to Convention Hall which had permitted entrance of dissident

elements on the Convention floor. Jenkins immediately placed these recommendations

into effect.

Thursday, August 27, 1964

We determined Martin Luthor King and his staff were departing from

rents

Atlantic City early Thursday morning, and appropriate officials were advised of this.

We also reported efforts of CORE-SNCC leaders to secure uniforms of the Young

Citizens for Johnson groups and to utilize them for gaining entrance into Convention

Hall. We were able to report that the number of participants of the silent vigil would

dwindle rapidly. Although the demonstrations quieted down Thursday night, we were

heavily involved in checking out the reports that a four-man group of Puerto Rican

terrorists from New York were in Atlantic City in an attempt to assassinate the

I President.

MISCELLANEOUS:

For the benefit of the Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative

Divisions, separate memoranda are being submitted regarding infomant coverage. I

jam also recommending letters of appreciation to cooperative individuals whose efforts

facilitated the squad's work in Atlantic City.

INFORMANT ACTIVITIES:

In connection with our Convention coverage, the special squad utilized

the following sources:

10 symbol number informants from other offices;

2 confidential sources from other offices;

1 liaison source from another office;

41 Negro informants (Newark informants not from out of town)

18 established sources in the Atlantic City area

1 Atlantic City NOI informant

2 Atlantic City Security informants

Our source from Washington, Hobson, was in the inner planning circles

of ACT. Another source brought the Progressive Labor Movement delegates to

Atlantic City. Although the organization was inactive, we had sources in the Muslim

groups. A Newark informant served as chauffeur for leaders of SNCC-CORE.

ORGANIZATIONS IN ATLANTIC CITY:

There was coverage on 15 soparate organizationo who wers activo in

Atlantic City during the course of the Convention. The leading groups included:

(3) It is recommended that letters from the Director be given to the

following personnel who assisted materially in the success of this operation:

Mr. James Kastner, District Manager, Allegheny Airlines, Inc., Washington National

Airport, Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. Kastner made the facilities of his company available

for courier service between Seat of Government and Atlantic City. Over six separate

packages of valuable material were delivered through use of this company. The letter

to Mr. Kastner should personally mention the assistance of the following Stewardesses:

Joan Deter, Lorraine Lemieux, Susan Melville, Harriet Eidinger and Margaret

Michalczyk.

Mr. Robert Northshield, Manager of News, National Broadcasting

Company, New York, New York. Mr. Northshield furnished us NBC credentials on
