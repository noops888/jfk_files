WILLIAM

UDERADED TO SECRET PER CIAD

Honorable William P. Rogers

Secretary of State

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Secretary:

In winding up my affairs

at the Department of State, there is a pend-

ing matter which I believe merits your attention.

Lee Harvey Oswaid, the presumed assassin of President Kennedy, Was

alledgedly present at

a party given by a Mexican communist sympathizer

and attended by the Cuban Consul, a veteran intelligence officer, when

he was in Mexico shortly before the assassination.

There are allega-

tions that the Mexican Government may have been aware of Oswald's

at that party and that the Cuban Government may have tried to

intimidate

others who saw him there.

A careful investigation of these allegations could perhaps explain

Until then, however,

their public disclosure could reoper

the debate about the true nature of the Kennedy assassination and

damage the credibility of the Warren Report.

Since I was the Embassy officer in Mexico who acquired this intelli-

gence information, I feel a responsibility for seeing it through

its final evaluation.

Accordingly, I have prepared a memorandum

(enclosed) explaining this information and

its initial assessment; keyed

to three memoranda of conversations with my Mexican informant.

I believe you would want to consider carefully whether to let well

enough alone in this case, or whether the risks attending possible

public disclosure of these allegations make further investigation:

warranted.

Respectfully.

Charles William Thomas

Enclosure:

Memorandum and four attachments.

Durans after the assassination about a party which Oswald had reportedly

attended, but that the transcript of the interrogation was entirely

unsatisfactory by normal investigatory standards.

Furthermore, the party

inquired about was not the one at Ruben Duran's house, reported by

Elena: Garro, but at an entirely different place. This transcript may

well be the source'of Mr. Ferris' belief that Elena Garro's story had been

checked out and

found to be untrue.

It'would appear that whereas the FBI hás discounted the Elena Garro

allegations,

the CIA is still considerably disturbed by them. The CIA.

may not have pressed for further investigation, however, for a number of

reasons: 1) considering the sensitive overlap

and subtle competition

between two intelligence collecting agencies, it had to yield to

clear jurisdiction;

2) there are obvious complications in conducting

such an investigation in a foreign country; 3) there is a close

delicate relationship between the CIA Station Chief and the former Minister

of, Interior - President Gustavo. Diaz Ordaz; and 4) some of the people

appearing in the Elena Garro scenario may well be agents of the

the circumstances it is unlikely that any further investigation

matter will ever take place unless it is ordered by a high official in

Washington.

11. If all the allegations in the attached memoranda

would not, in themselves, prove that there was a conspiracy to assassinate

President Kennedy:

However,, if they were ever made public, those who

have tried to discredit the Warren Report could have a field day in

speculating about their implications. The credibility of the Warren Report

would be damaged all the more if it were learned that these allegations.

were known and never adequately investigated by the competent American

authorities.

12.

Reference is made again to the biographic report (Tab A) on Elena

Garro. She is hardly an ordinary or average person.

Her strengths and

weaknesses become exaggerated precisely because she is not. It would

be easy

and convenient to sweep

this matter under the rug by claiming,

that Miss Garro is

an unreliable informant since

she is emotional;

opinionated, and "artistic." I have been affected at times by that.

temptation, myself:

No American official, however, knows her better than

I dọ.

On the basis of the facts that I have presented, I believe that,

on balance, the matter warrants further investigation.

13. Finally, the record should show that a representative of a major

American publication has at least some knowledge of this story.:
