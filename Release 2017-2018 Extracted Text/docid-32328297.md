Late in 1952 WILLIAMS was checking on the whereabouts

of PETER JULIAN

madam from Chicago, came to the

door and permitted WILLIAMS

to walk through their apartment in order to get to a boat dock

at the rear of the building where the Manager was then located.

is he passed through the apartment WILLIAMS observed PETE ARN-

STEIN to duck into the kitchen.

He noticed that there was

some sort of a meeting of ten men going on in the living room.

Subsequent thereto, WILLIAMS went to the Miami Beach PD and

examined a number of photographs.

He identified the photographs

Of PAUL LABRIOLA, FBI Number 1153214; EDWARD VOGEL, FBI Number

4329702; and, ROBERT BENNETT as definitely being present at

the above meeting.

LABRIOLA and. VOGEL are well-known Chicago

criminals and BENNETT is the chauffeur for Miami Beach City

Councilman MARCIE LIEBERMAN. WILLIAMS also is of the belief

that bave laras was present at this meeting, but could not be

absolutely positive of his identification.

It is not improb-

able that

YARAS was there as it has come

to the attention of

the Miami Office that he is an associate of ARNSTEIN.

Although

TARAS spends considerable time in Havana, Cuba

he still main-

tains his residence at 4410 Adams Avenue, Miami Beach.

that he still had a financial interest in the Tahiti Bar 10-

cated at 224 - 23rd Street, Miami Beach, which
