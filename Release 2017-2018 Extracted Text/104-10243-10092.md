MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: Relationa with Manolo RAY and the MRP

1. For background see my memorandun of li liay 1961, resorting on

mY LONG DESALOR WiLL DiADOLO RAY, ROgeliO CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto

BETANCOURI. As wiil be noted in that memorandum, land!o promised to

come us wils a pros, ectus menia approximmely ten daya' simo, alter con-

mulliag with his leaders la Cuba.

2. On l June 196l Mr. Earnes called me to say that ir. Goodwir had

been visited by dir. Ernesto BETANCOURI wa0 asked for immediase linancial

support for certain activit les of the WAF which would run around slu. idi

dollars. Mir. Barnes arked me lo contact BETANCOURT for the pus; ose of:

ascertaining what the funde were to be used for, exactly how much nerded, ete.

I called BEIANCOURI and be sold me that I abould ge: these decaila from

CISNEROS (Eugenlo), who was staying as roor 549 al the irasalaston Hotel.

I called Eugenlo and made a doia for me ond Ray DuBois (Raj Adams is te

name he uses with Ray and Cisneros) to call upon him. "e called on CISNEROS

#: approximately 18+5 houre l'Jus, and he informer. us thas he had urgent

meed for pesos for use la support of his saboiage and underground activities

in Caba. He sale his poople were absoluely witzout funda, needed money for.

living expendes, trenportation porciname of sabotage eguipment, air fares for

couriera, and for assisting people to gel out of prison.

He said that it was

now possible for people to buy their way ous of prlion by oribing one of tbe

may comrain lawyers and judges. He tought thas 14, coo or Sú. voc

would meet immediate nood and that some sort of arrangemen should be made

so receive funda - 36,000 mombly or incresboue • on a fixed and permanent

basle.

We made no commitment to Eugenio. other than to ony that we woald

pass hia plea along to the interested poople. I reminded him char we had asted

Aim and Manolo to prepare a plan for consideration and thai we were sell

waiting for thas plas.'I said I personally doubted that anything could be done

mii tho plan vas received from RAY. He sald Manolo was planning so come to

Washingson on the afternoon of › June with the plan, but coas be hinsell was

having to return so Miami Immediarely and it vas vital he be able to late che

money already in Cuba - dollars sould be dellvered lo ornere of lhe pesos who

• are la Miami). I told him I would call him in the morning to let him know how

Chlage 11ood.

* I diacuosed our meeting with CISNEROS with Iracy Barnes on she

morning of ¿ June. I was Iracy's opinion, in which I hearily concus. that

we should put ous no monaj whatsoever until re have had a chance to examine

Manolo'e plan and lo sudy just was repercussiona or ran:ifications tere

would be, policy-wise and othermine, to a decialon 1o assist the :18P

milaterally; that is, ouside the Council and presumably withou MIRO's

Inowledge or consent. Since RAY has withdrawn his grous frora the Council

with a grea: deal of fanfare, it is mosi unlikely that MIRO could loak sindly

OR aDy ASiatenCe LO RAY, eavecially ance he leels he has a rather firea

promime from the President z0 deal only through VIRO.

5. RAY, upon arrival in Hashiagtos,

*ill presumably take his plan (along

wich BETANCOURT) directly to Mir. Goodwin and I would also presume that

Goodwin will pass li down to Iracy and T.acy so 88. Ray DuBoia, who bas

beca Misnolo's case olficer, is standing by ln làe evens be should be needeá.

6. I perinally feel very strongly that we sbould do nothing to sapport the

plas, whatever lt is, until we have received irom the white touse asd the

Department clear-cus, unequivocal policy guidance on the overall plan. I also

feel that now is the lime. If we are seing to support the MRP unilaterally, so

immert a pos-official cut oui into the operation.

I would recommend thar con

elderation be given 10 saing M5. liarry Pleper (a NAVE conrace employee)

on abi, jo Harry lo impérmenally suiivi, has a good business head, is

luens in Spaniah (lived 48 years in Cuba), is cleared, followe directions,

complorely boness and tremendously conscientious. It would be harder so

And a better parson.

1. Also, I would like to poins out the security riska inherent in any arraage-

meate with the RAY-BETANCOURI-CISNEROS triO. These fellow have had

anny accent to the White House and so the Departcent, are notorious ior their

"planned leaka': will probably presume all the Department officials they deal

wich are privy to the arrangemen, and belore we know it the whole exile

community will be well aware that me are providiag financial and material

SIppOr 1O the RAT group. I ain not arguing againes providing such support.

but am merely polmiag out the real porential for embarrassment to us il the

malter la nos handled wil lhe grentent of precautione. I feel they bave become

too closely identifled wich U. 5. -olficialdom, Including wuysell, and that the

plausible denial aspecta, to dase as least, are almoss son-exetent.
