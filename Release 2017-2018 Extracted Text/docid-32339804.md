RELEASE IN PART

Re San Juan letter to Bureau

dated 8/22/68.

JOTAL DENIAL

Review of the indices of the Miami Office revealed

numerous references to BLANCH, most of which are found in

HOHN

communications, copies of which are available to the San

Juan Office. U

In addition to these, it was noted that Bureau

ALL IN

OGHERWISE

airtel of 1/23/64 in the file on the SNFE provided infor-

mation from the Department of Justice to the effect that

U.S. Army Intelligence had an operational interest in

certain members of the SNE, including VECIANA..

For the

information of San Juan, it is believed that Army Intelligence

no longer has any operational interest in VECIANA or other

members of the SNFE and that this interest terminated with

the capture of GUTIERREZ MENOYO in Cuba, in January, 1965.

2 fon September 20,

1966, 4MM [1115-5* who has

furnished reliable information in the past and who is

personally acquainted with VECIANA, advised that VECIANA,

who had been the treasurer of the

FE, was no longer

connected with the organization

&on October 4,

1968,

MM 847-S,

who is a member

of the SNFE, advised that to his knowledge, VECIANA has

had no connection with the SNFE for several years.

This

informant said that the last he had heard,

VECIANA - was

residing in Puerto Rico and was

not active in anti-CASTRO

affairs.
