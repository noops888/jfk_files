Subject: Bly Manuscript in JFK Collection - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGEL

INFORMATION/ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

You asked me to review an excerpt of a manuscript titled Communism: The 20th Century Red Plague, by

Herman O. Bly labelled as copyrighted, and determine whether it should be released to NARA for

inclusion in the collection of administrative files relating to JFK. These "administrative" files include

documents such as this one, which might be considered substantive JFK records, discovered after the

bulk of the JFK collection was constructed. After further discussion, I found that the document is atready

in NARA's custody but not yet accessible to the public; the issue is whether to pull it out of the collection,

authorize NARA to release it in full, or redact it in some fashion. Although CIO/Legal's preference is to

take it out of the collection, we understand the political difficulties in doing so (specifically an anticipated

strong objection from NARA) and consequently endorse redacting the document, as well as the attached

cover letter and statement of background information, in fuli for as long as allowable under the JFK Act.

The draft was sent to the Agency in 1997; along with a statement of background information, with a cover

letter requesting review by the CIA Publications Review Board (PR8). None of these documents should

have been considered relevant to the JFK Act. The cover letter and statement of background information

contain no information about JFK whatsoever. The draft itself, white it does include a small amount of

information on JFK, is not a Govemment record and is consequently not responsive to the Act.

Manuscripts submitted for review to the PRB and housed in its files, such as the draft at issue here.

contain only non-official views, and are not used to further Government business. The information in this

manuscript is only the personal view of an ex-employee in his non-official capacity. The copyright label is

a further indication that this was at no time meant to be considered a Government record, but the personal

record of an author.

Nonetheless, because the documents have been released to NARA already, the best solution is to

withhold them for as long as NARA will allow us to do so. Because the records will have been

accessioned to NARA by the time they will be released, NARA is the proper agency to address whether

the information is actually copyrighted, and how that impacts release to the public.

Please let me know if my factual understanding is incorrect, or if you have any questions.

EPILOGUE

This book would not be complete without further commentary on

my activities in combatting Marxist-Leninist communism after

'my

retirement irom government service.

• During my 23 years of service in the FBI. I received 17 letters of

commendation and one meritorious award. My retirement party was

heid at 5 P.M. on August i2, 1963, in the large room in the

Department of Justice Building, where the eight Nazi saboteurs were

tried. Director j. Edgar Hoover attended. I do not recall that Director

Hoover had ever attended a retirement party lor any empioyee less

than an Assistant Director. So I felt honored that he had attended. A

total oì 132 FBI employees attended and signed my retirement book. 1

was presented with a matched set oi Wiison K-28 goii clubs. The

following Saturday morning I was iortunate enough to use these new

ciubs and shot a par 72 round oi golf at the Country Club of Fairtax.

where i had been a member since 1956.

In September 1963. I received a telephone call from the Central

Intelligence Agency (CLA) suggesting that I drop by the CLA

Headquarters and meet with Dr. Lothar Metzie. This I did. He

offered me a position as Senior Start Officer in his unit called

Communist international Group (CiG) under a rive year contract. My

pre-employment security investigation was satistactory and 1 began

work in December 1963. Ds. Metzle occasionally jokingly referred to

me as "Mir. CP.USA." I enjoyed my five vears of service at CiA very

much and when it came time for a renewal of my contract in

HW 53216 DocId:32404387 Page 6

## Page 7

December 1968, the Johnson Administration was having considerable

trouble with its Balance of Payments. Agencies were facing cutbacks

and several hundred CLA employees were walking the halls at CLA

Headquarters trying to find a spot to work after coming from abroad.

Contracts were not being renewed and it was with regret that I left the

CLA

My service in CIA was varied. In the Spring of 1965, I was sent to

Mexico City: my assignment to review all the files on Soviet personnel

in Mexico, which were located at the U.S. Embassy: I spent 30 days

determining from the known activities of each person as to what extent

he may have been engaged in espionage activities. From the

information gathered, it was possible to determine more than 50

percent were engaged in varying degrees of espionage activity. When

I returned to CIA Headquarters in McLean, Virginia, I prepared an 85

page monograph that was used as a training manual for CIA agents

assigned to Latin American countries in contact with Soviet

activities.

During the course of my review of the files on Soviet personnel. I

ran across the following information that related to Lee Harvey

Oswald and the November 1963 assassination of President John F.

Kennedy First I was somewhat startled to learn that when Oswald

was arrested in Dallas in November 1963, he was asked if he wanted

an attorney. Oswald reportedly replied, "Yes, I want attorney Abt." It

turns out that Abt was the New York City attorney for the Soviet

Purchasing Commission and the Soviet Embassy, Colonel

Rudolf Abel, a suspected key Soviet KGB agent was arrested in New

York City on June 21, 1957. At the time of Abel's arrest, much

espionage evidence was located in his room at the Hotel Latham.

When he was arrested he also reportedly indicated he wanted attorney

Abt. Colonel Abel was convicted of espionage and served his prison

sentence until 1962, when he was exchanged for U-2 pilot Francis

Gary Powers after long negotiations by attorney James: Donovan.

When Oswald visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in 1963.

the man he went to see was the Soviet official in charge of issuing

visas. This seemed quite reaschable as the excuse by Ogwald for

visiting the Embassy was to obtain a visa to visit Cuba. The irerly of

this situation is that the Soviet official in charge of issuing visas was

also the KGB Soviet espigpnage agent reportedly connected with EGB

Department 13 activities, which included assassinations.

The third thing that intrigued me about the Oswald case was the

fact that this young former U.S. Marine was able to bring his Russian

wife home from the Soviet Union when colonels and other American

businessmen were unable to bring their Russian wives home from the

Soviet Union. Why was Oswald allowed this special treatment?

The above information worried me and and when I got back to CLA

Headquarters, I prepared a memo for the CLA official who had been in

liaison with the Warren Commission. The "1970 Information Please

Almanac" states that on September 37, 1964, the President's

commission on the assassination of President Kennedy issued its

report (Warren Report) which concludes that Lee Harvy Oswald acted

alone in the assassination of President Kennedy. I believe the heads of

the FBI, CLA and President Johnson in the White House wanted the

Oswald case brought to a conclusion as fast as possible as they did not

want another crisis with the soviet Union so soon after the 1963

Cuban missile crisis.

After leaving government service in December 1968, I did not lose

my fervor in the fight against atheistic Marxist-Leninist communism.

I kept on speaking out against this menace. The following is a list of

lectures which I gave on various aspects of the communist threat:

September 9, 1968 - lecture at a meeting of the Arlington, *

Virginia Lions Club at the Washington Golf & Country

Club.

January 12. 1971 - lecture before the Rotary Clubor McLean:

Virginia.

November 7, 14. 21, 28, 1971 - a series of four lectures at the

Cherrydale United Methodist Church, Arlington, Virginia.

January 30, 1973 - lecture at a meeting of the Bethesda,

Chevy Chase Rotary Club at the Kenwood Country Club

in Bethesda, Maryland.

April 26, 1974- lecture before the Methodist Men's Group of

Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church, Ft. Myers,

Florida.

March 26, 1975 - lecture at a meeting of the Forever Young

Group of Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church,
