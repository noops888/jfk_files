Richard Gibson who is identical with" "SugagS) Gibson is

an American now living in England who was formerly the leader

of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Jithe ARC is an intelligance

operation projected as a legitimate pro-Chicon organizatiOn)

We are declining New York's suggestion to have Sugar contact

Crank because it is not felt he is closely associated with ner

to a degree where such a contact would be logical and also

because contact with her could jeopardize the AHC operation.
