biii)

It appears that the conclusion of the WARREN Coumission

is that LEE OSWALD was the sole author of the crime and that

his motive was strictly personal. In regard to the astassination

Of OSWALD, the Commission appears to have accepted the thesis

that JACK RUBY also acted on strictly personal notivation both

evidently having suffered from mental unbalance or instability.
