BLACK PANTHER PARTY

FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION

EXTREMIST MATTER - BLACK PANTHER PARTY

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George

Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black

people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of

the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther

Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called

"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the

use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program

to end the oppression of the black people but since early

1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-

munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the

U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders

have since avoided extreme statements in favor of

calling

for action within the established order. Newton, in an

interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"

magazine, stated the Panthers'

chief

ambition is to change

the American Government by any means necessary but that

ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,

indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.

Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested

in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,

murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of

Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges and

is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three

were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Secret Army Organization (SAO) was clandestinely

formed during the Fall of 1971 in Arizona. Membership to date

has been small and it appears to have the same basic terats as.

the Minutemen. In fact, several of those involved in SAO

were formerly active in the Minutemen. The mail drop for

this organization reportedly is in care of an individual in

Ramona, California, who has been involved in Minutemen and

white-hate activities in the past.

This ultraconservative paramilitary organization

was recently involved in extremist activities in San Diego,

California.

Members of this group reportedly made threatening

telephone calls to a local college professor who is active

in a group which plans to organize demonstrations at the

forthcoming Republican National Convention, Iollowing these

telephone calls, a member of SAO fired shots from an auto-

nobile into the professor's home, wounding a

guest.

to the Alexandria, Virginia Police Department had recently

been approached by pessons, which

that source described as

Ihe Alexandria, Virginia Police Department estab-

lished appropriate surveillance at this company, and an un-

known person was seen to cut through the cyclone fence ap-

proximately 7:30 P.M. on March I, 1969, and thereafter crawl

under the building.

An attempt was made by this individual

to saw a hole chrough the floor of the building, but the

would-be burgla: was hampered in his sawing operation by guns

and cases, which obstructed his sawing as well as the cold

and

water

under the building.

He was seen to depart through

the hole in the fence, which he then temporarily repaired.

He was not successful in gaining access to the building nor

in obtaining any weapons. No arrest were made, hoping that

accomplices would also be involved.

Inspector Johnson advised on March 3 and March 10,

1969 that the police have a

"monitoring device" at the build-

ing, which will alert them at the police headquarters to any

unusual noises alter working hours, inasmuch as they neve

withdraw their surveillance team.

He stated that the source

of information is not a member of the Black Panthers, but

that the source continues to describe the burglars as such.

Tripp stated that social turmoil as manifested by

Re: Black Panther Party

Leonard Brown mentioned the fact that the white

policemen must realize that the black people are not

afraid of them and will defend themselves in any criticai

situation. Brown mentioned the fact that a good example of

the white police officer is the incident that occurred in

New York City where 200 white off-duty policemen attacked

innocent members of the EPP.

Brown further stated that the

black political leaders in the country are nothing but

"phonies" and "Uncle Toms".

He further stated it is time

for the white power structure to realize that it is impossible

to dictate to the black people as they have been doing for

years and that the black people only want à chance to govern

their community as they see fit.

Victor Stewart stated that the BPP in its useful

state is not an "underground party" but an "above the ground

party"

• Stewart stated that the only way the black people can

excel or exist in this world controlled by the white man is to

take what he wants.

asking or getting on your knees begging the white power

structure.

le further stated that the key to the black man's

destiny is through black political education classes in

which he will be cognizant of the political structure in this

country. Stewart further stated that the BPP's motto is

"All power to the people; Black power to black people"

Marian Kramer, Negro,

female, stated that the black

female must awaken and play a vital role in organizing the

BPP.

She stated for years the black female has been neglected

from the political system

in our country.

Sources in the Detroit area who are familiar with

the black nationalist movement, stated that they, have no

information at this time that a BPP is organized in the

Detroit area and conducts regular scheäuled meetings. These

sources further advised that during other black militant

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, alSO

known as Black Panther Party

for Self Defense

A source advised that the Black Panther Party for

Self Defense (BPPSD) was formed by HUEY PERCY NEWTON, Minister

of Defense, and BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, Chairman, in December,

1966, as a militant black nationalist political organization

to combat "police brutality", to unite militant black youth,

and to determine the destiny of black communities.

The

political philosophy was taken from writings of Chairman MAO

Tse-tung of Communist China and black militant writers.

In March, 1968, the name of the organization was

changed to Black

Panther Party (BPP).

The official BPP publication, "The Black Panther

Party - Black Community News Service", states that the BPP

advocates use of guns and guerrilla tactics in their violent

revolutionary program to end oppression of black people.

On February 17, 1968, ELDRIDGI CLEAVER, Minister of

Information, announced

merger of the BPP and Student Non-violent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and bestored title of Minister of

Justice, BPP, upon El. RAP BROWiN, Chairman of SNCC.

SNCC is a militant Negrö' organization

STUDENT NON-VIOLENT CCORDINATING CONCITTEE

The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),

headquartered at 360-362 Nelson Street, S.V., Atlanta, Georgia,

is a non-membership organization, which was

born out of the

sit-in movement that erupted across the South beginning in

1960.

Today SNCC identifies itself as an organization in the

revolutionary vanguard. It advocates that to be successiul it

is necessary to develop a revolutionary ideology and revolutionary

progran.

According to SNCC, the year 1957 marked a historic

milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people

in the United States and the year that revolutionaries

throughout

the world began to understand more fully the impact of the

black movement.

SNCC declared that "liberation will come only

when there is final destruction pi this mad octupus--the capitalis-

tic systen of the United States with all its life-sucking

tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke the people of

Africa, Asia,

and Latin America.

The realities of black life,

together with the recognition instilled in SNCC workers forced

its members to further

popularize the legitimacy of self-

defense and

rebellious when oppression became too great."

BLACK PANIHER PARTY (BPP)

also known as

Black Panther Party for S

$ Defense

Accordin

to the official newspaper i

the BPE, the BPP

was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life,

politics, and

the destiny of the block community. It was

organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairian, and HUEY P. NEWTON,

Minister of Defense, EPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPy advocates the use of guns and

guerrilli tactics in iis revolutionary program to end oppression

of the black people.

Residents of the black community are

urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The nowspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an

article by the then Minister of Eucation, GEORGE HURRAY.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use

the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of Occober 5, 1968, had an

article introduced with the following statement:

"Ke will

not; dissent from american government. We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the

San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will

Kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New JOrk Times," issue of

÷: December 13, 1959, was quoted as follows:

"We advocate the

very direct

overthrow of the government by way of force

and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had

an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:

"The only way to make this racist US governnent administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials,

until the reactionary forces... are dead and those that

are left turn their weayons on their superiors,

thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all mankind, the racist US governnent:"

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1016 Peralta Street,

Oakland, California. Branches of the BPI, and Committees to

Combat Fascism, under control of the BIP, have been established

•In various locations in the USA.:

•History of

me Secret Army Organization

CONFIDENTIXE

One carly morning in Fcbruary, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from

four states mot secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonment of two top Minutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

as Minutemen group leaders, others were inceting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordiation organization of militant right-wing groups had

effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist elements inside the Justice Depart-

ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity

by communists in the United States.

With these two points

in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of

action to be followed. After

a meeting that lasted all that day and far into, the next

morning, an overall plan of action was linally agreed upon. All present agreed to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

completely new chain of command and organizational siructure. If the new organiza-

tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This

then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original

force of hard core patriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began thejob of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

S. A. O. has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as

the freedom fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have

no desire lo commit suicide ourselves. or lo let our members do so. We have a •

strategy which we helieve will ultimately lend to victory. Only one thing is essential.

We must start preparing and training NOW? We of the S. A. O. believe that our couniry

'is worthy of any sacrifice. If you feel the same way, we invite you to join us.

spective Members Of The

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

CONFIDENTIAL

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and

most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.

We are willing to make any sacrifice for pur country and we fuily expect that some of

us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

learned his job.

Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political

situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation

faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, 'perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and, enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must

know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages of development.

1) The Underground Network

2) Active Guerrilla Warfare

3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

enemy does but must also have active guerrillas and underground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot

succeed unless these. other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The first step is to form al underground network. An active guerrilla system

must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its

own

size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-

cealment, information, etc. An underground network starts with departments of

intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion,

infiltration, escape and evasion, training,

clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfeiting chemy documents, recruiting, com-

munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member

of the Secret Army Organization, lo be effective, must have a working knowledge of

all these tactics as woll as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-

la activitios.

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

CONE INSATIAL

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization

seem to have an idea that they will be immediately' accepted into an active unit.

Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully rccruiting and

training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-

cated,, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to

have the national

or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit

that you you knew little or nothing about?

Beforé any new memher is assignedto an active unit or to an important under-

ground project, he mastundergo a peried of training. During this training he will be

directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

be observed by other members

without his knowledge. Only when a new member

proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, sell-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will hebe accepted as a "secure member"' and invited to participate

with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

• EXPENSES •

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you

must expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3. 00 per month. This money is

absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for

postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence-network, and to maintain

training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, amnunition and

otner basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy

and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, etc.

Following this preliminary training a memher may be either assigned to an

existing unit, assisted in organizing his ownunit if he has shown sufficient leadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

definite series of projects described in writing so you will know exactly what will be

expected of you.

We hope that you can succeed in this effort because your country desperately

needs patriots at this time.

headed by Adolf Hitler. He added that Rockwell is the dominant

force and personality in this party; that he is espousing a "line"

of hatred against the Jews and Negroes; and that he is seeking,

through speeches,

distribution of literature and picketing, to

establish a cohesive and dominant political party in the United

States and in foreign countries.

Irene had been arrested approximately three months

ago in Pueblo,

Colorado, on a charge of robbing a filling station. He reported

his daughter had béen placed in the custody of her parents until

such time as there is an additional hearing in the matter.

"While Irene was in the fueblo County Jail she started

receiving letters

from Brown, a person whom she has never

personally met.

File pointed out irene's picture had appeared

in newspapers aiter her arrest, and it is possible Brown may

have gotten her name and

address from a newspaper article.

File made available a copy of a letter of November 9,

1964, addressed to his daughter. He advised she is not aware

of the fact he had made such a copy. The letter is quoted as

Mrs. S. I. Snodgrass, a noman in her early 60's, has

resided next door at 1926 Awapuhi for at least 12 years.

Mrs.

Lowrey stated she has no idea of Mrs. Snodgrass' background and

does not know if she is a divorcee or widow.

The related that

Mrs. Snodgrass lives a quiet life, has

a substantial home, and

enjoys a good reputation in the community. She related that

Snodgrass has a divorced daughter, Mrs. Brown, who is a

local school teacher. Mrs. Brown formerly lived on Cahu Avenue

about 20 years of age, has recently returned to Honolulu to

Iive with his grandmother. He has been in one of the branches

of the armed services for some three years and is now attending

the University of Hawaii. •Mrs. Lowrey stated Mrs. Snodgrass had

expressed

relief that her grandson had enrolled at the university,

explaining that when he had graduated from high school he had

not wanted to go on with his, schooling.

discipline was concerned. When he was some 14 years of age

he was caught burglarizing the ROTC Armory on the campus.

released that date to Juvenile Crime Prevention.

Those files

reflect Brown, then a resident of 2648B Rock Road, was a .14-year-

one on the rifle range and one in the ROTC garage.

On

Fletcher and Brown, when questioned by the police, adnitted

the above burglaries and the fact they had taken some $5.95

in cash, $5 in school supplies and $10 worth of RCTC equipment.

AMERICAN NAZI PARTY OF THE WORLD UNION

OK FREE ENIEFPRISE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS,

ALSO KNOWN AS THE GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL PARTY

"In his book, This Time The World, copyrighted in 1961,

George Lincoln Rockwell identified himself as Commander, American

Nazi Party of the World Union of Free Enterprise National

Socialists (ANP - WUTENS), Arlington, Virginia.

The April 4, 1993 issue of "The Richmond News Leader,"

a richmond, Virginla daily newspaper, reported that George

Rockwell had, on the previous day, again applied for

the American Nazi Farty to be chartered in the State of

Virginia, but this request was turned down by the Virginia

State Corporation Commission.

to an act of the 195a Virginia Assembly which prohibits use of

"Nazi" or "National socialism" in a Virginia charter. This

article further pointed out that Rockwell's party is

presently

chartered in the fraïe of Virginia as the George Lincoln.

Rockwell Party.

On August 14, 1964, a source advised that the AND -

WUFENS was organized by

• George Lincoln Rockwell at his

residence in Arlingion, Virginia,

on February 26, 1959, as an

international "National Socialist" movement based on the German

Nazi Party headed by Adolf Hitler.

He added. that

that; he'is

espousing a "line" of hatred against the Jews and Negroes;.:

and that he is seeking, through speeches, distribution of

literature and picketing, to establish a cohesive and dominant

political party in the United States and in foreign countries.

According to the "Stormtrooper's Manual," an official

publication of the AnP,

the phases of ANd struggle for power

are

¡ouriold, namely, first "to make ourselves known to the

masses;" second "the dissemination of our program and the

truth about the Party;" third "organizing the people who have

been converted to our propaganda;"

and fourth "the

attainnent

of pover through the votes of the newly-won masses."

On February 17, 1964, Karl Rogers Allen, Jr., former

Deputy National Commander of the ANP, advised that George

Lincoln Rockwell believes he has completed the first two phases

in his struggle for power and is now well into the third phase.

Allen said, however, in his opinion, icekwell has only completed

phase one.

Our survival services are

essential to the daily existence of the people."

2. Communication with BPP National Headquarters

DE T-I advised on April 27, 1973 that LONNIE

DARDEN, Detroit BPP Minister of

Information, received a

telephone call in late April, 1973, from BOBBY SEALE in

California.

SEALE reportedly told

DARDEN that the Detroit

BPP Chapter has the least number of actively involved

members of all BPP Chapters throughout the country.

SEALE also complained that the Detroit Chapter is operating

only two survival programs (the Free Breakfast Program and

the Free Busing to Prison Program) and warned DARDEN that

the Detroit Chapter will have to take steps to initiate a

substantial number of survival programs to serve the

Detroit Black community as it deserves to be served.

II. MEMBERSHIP

A. Requirements for Membership

The BPP is constantly attempting to recruit

community workers from the black community to hep in

the operation of the BPP

programs.

Outsiders, however,

are not trusted by established Party members and community

workers are not allowed inside the Party Office or pad.

They are required to sell BPP newspapers and to perform

various other duties "in the field"

There are also approximately six community workers

who are young high school age blacks who are interested in

the BPP and help sell BPP newspapers and solicit donations

to the Party.

They hold no official Party status and their

interest in

the Party's work vacillates and their work is

irregular and inconsistent.

DE T-2

April 4, 1973

The fact that four Detroit Party members are

presently in California, the fact that so many Detroit

Party members work for the Party on a very limited basis

and the wavering interest of the community workers has

severely hurt the BPp's success in the last six months

in Detroit.

Political Education Classes

Plitical Education classes are no longer held

on a regular basis. The classes are held occasionally

during the week as

• the Party feels it is more beneficial

to personally come into contact with members of the black

community on a one-to-one basis.

For this reason, Party

members solicit donations and sell BPP newspapers door to

door and attempt to "rap" with the people concerning the

BPP, its aims and programs.

DE T-2

April 3, 1973

For example, DE I-2 advised on January 30, 1973

that a Political Education class was conducted by ALVIN

BROWN, BPP Member at the 157 Collingwood Office on

January 29, 1973.

Book of chaiy

The class was entitled "Liberalism

in the Red Book of Chairman Mao". Only three non-Party

members were in attendance.

In order to establish a better rapport with the

members of the black community and in order to raise money

for the Party,

the Party organized and sponsored the

following events:

On December 20, 1972, LONNIE DARDEN, BPP-NF

leader at Detroit, was interviewed under suitable pretext

by a Special Agent of the FBI and DARDEN made the following

statement regarding ELDRIDGE CLEAVER:

in the BPe. We're (BPP-NE) not saying that

there is a peaceful co-existence that will

exist between the BPP and Eldridge Cleaver.

We're saying that the court systems are

responsible for the execution of poor and

oppressed people and we in turn are exposing

the court system in this particular racist

attitude against poor and oppressed people

and not trying to build a peaceful co-existence

with a particular element that had defected

from the Party."

ticketed more than 25 times in the past year for loitering

and interfering with pedestrian traffic.

to state that members of the Party are being harassed

because they are black.

Philosophy of the BPP

In explaining the new Fanther image, GERALD

CRAWFORD stated,

"For too long the Panther Party has found

itself in the role of defender, rather than educator of

the community.

We feel the Party should be a vehicle to

take the community to Liberation

and not the force which

consistently finds itself in conflict with

the Police.

We are now moving toward the role of humanitarians, and

our goal is humanization of all mankind.

We would

to remove all racial and class barriers. Our struggle is

more a class struggle - racher than à racial one, and

our role is to educate the community to that fact.

We

are not trying to teach individuals what to think, but

instead, we are trying to teach them to think for

themselves and objectively analyze the situation we find

ourselves in.

"Ironically, those people who can best perform

this service turn their backs on the conmunity and help

those forces which are oppressing all of us.

College

students today do not bring their talents back to the

community, but help to build the system which they have

suffered under.

In order for us to succassfully perform

our duty, we need the support of the community the

Panthers are a part of the community and need

its entise

support. Without this support, we will be unable to

continue our fight against oppression.

"For the past ten years, the Blacl: Panther Party

has found itself on

in newspapers.

2 on the covere de

the covers of national magazines and

Reposters have described Panther members

as Communists and revolutionaries:

But for

saverdi reasons

this description is not applicable to today's Black Panther

Party. In the past tro years, the Panther

Party has

underqone drastic changes.

Black Panther members nave tried

to drop the role of guerilla fighters and are putting every

effort into being known as educators and humanitarians.

"The Party's Detroit Chapter is trying extremely

hard to change its image fron community bodyguard to community

servant."

by these racist pigs. The

cople of this community are no going to stand still

and see another little Danny Smith get shot down.

Some of the brothers and sisters who are members of the N.C.C.F. were victims

of pig harrassment. These brotbers and sisters were relating to the people in

the community of Highland Park. They were beaten and kidnapped off the streets

o1 Babylon. This is the plot and plan of the facists to try to exterminate the

Black Panther Party. Ine pig's are openly making statements on radio and I.V.

to try and destroy the Party. But the Black Panther Party is strong. It is strong

because it's the peoples party. After the statement was made by Pig Mayor Black-

well, J. Hog-lead Hoover made a statement about the Black Panther Party being the

most dangerous and violent organization in the country. This pig knows that the .

Black Panther Party is relating the real deal: about this foul system. How these

pig forces are carrying out the orders of fascism against the American People in

general and Black People in particular. J.. Hog Head Hoover knows he is a pig

and a pig is: a pig 'is a pig. Right On!!

The lying politicians runs this cold game on the people that the U.S. Govern-

nent is existing for the benefit of the people. The real deal is that the U.s.

Government is the largest facist iorce there is. And the Black Panther Party is

hip to the game these low lifed pigs are trying to run down. So there is no way

out for these pigs.

Evidence of this is seen daily. through out the glaci Community. Such as the un-

of Highland Park imposed another of these unanthorised curfews, in which black people

were beaten, gased, shot, arrested, for

violation, of this illegal curfer.

June 28,1970 Red, Lewrence White, end Michael Anderson, wore attacked, gased,

fired upon, acrestedy and incarcerutca by the Dotroit Police Department, and heid for

75,000 dollars ranson apiece. Inese brothers are in Jail today because they chose

to defend themselves when attacked, rather than accapting their own murder in the

PAINT MALIK AND WILLIAM VOLUNTEERED TO GET MORE. THEY WERE THRFE DCORS FROM

THE HOUSE WHEN 50 SIORMTROOPERS STOPPED THEM AND DEMANDED A CAR REGISTRATION.

¡HEI THIS WAS PRODUCED THEY COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR AND SAID THAT THE

SUCHERS WERE LYING. THIS WAS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO HAND CUFF THE BROTHERS. "

THE TWO BROTHERS TRYED TO CLARIFY THE ISSUE, AND WERE HIT IN THE HEAD

WITH GUNS AND CLUBS. BY THIS TIME MRS. MCCLURE AND TOMMY HAD COME CUT OF THE

HOUSE. WHEN TOMMY CAME OUT ON THE PORCH, THE RACIST DOGS TURNED ON HIM. MRS.

NECLURE WAS ATTACKED WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS FAPPENING TO.

MRS. MCCLURE, MALIK, IOMMY AND WILLIAM PROTECIED THENSELVES AS BEST THEY

COULD BUT ALL WERE BRUTALLY BEAKEN. MALIK SUFFERED SEVERE HEAD WOUNDS, INTREAL

here. A lot of us will be dead soon-very soon. The chief of Pigs in this city

Kurpby has conspired with the head of the F.B.I., J. Edgar Hoover (Pig) to attack

and destroy the nembers of the N.C.C.F. here. At this very nonent the l0th precinct

=. is and hes been for two weeks stock piling weapons, and when I say weapons, I mean

tails and half tracks and.all the conventional weapons of modern warfare to attack

what they call the "Panther Complex"- not office but complex. They (the pigs) have

been trying hard to create an incident. First the news media cones out with a lie

that we have over 200 weapons and over 100, 000 rowads of ammunition at this öffice

non as Highland Par's where the Mayor stated after occupying the community, shoot

ing and beating Black people-"I don't lnow why the Black Panthers want to pick on

=y little city." When in actuality it was the people responding to the racist mur-

•ders of acople at the Kozy Korner Bar. The brother was shot after an argurent ensued.

I because the brother didn't have the money for a drink. the brother was black--the

surderer was khite--the brother was unarned. Ine people's response was; the bar was

PART 11

Due to the brainvashing done by IV,

movies, comics ect, there are a lot of

incorrect iceas about tireams that must

be cleared up. The first thing to under

stand is, there is no piece (jun) that

covers any and all situations. Although

they show gigs on Ty ard in the movies

this is not

esipted wiless you are an expert's expert.

Fron seeing to nuch Hyatt Earp and Mat

Dillon, too many people think that if they

¡ have a hand gu either pistol or revolver

that they are ready for anything. All

,that is necessary to give you a differ

ent perspective is to examine the arma-

ment of the gigs that eccupy our Black.

Communities anywhere in Babylon. When

you do that you will discover that most

vig cars nave at least one .12 gauge pump

or autonatic shotgun; one or two semi-

, autoratic or automatic assault rifles,

one

as two bolt action rifles with a scope

licunted for snipping purposes, and of

course, the pigs have stragned on at

Least one haragun either an automatic

pistol or a revolver. In San Francisco,

the S.F. Tactical Squad members carry two

(zanaguns,

their standard service revolver

lus a secozd handgun which is their per-

• sonal preference; in many cases an auto-

¡atic pistol. So at this time let's

xamine these three types of weapons; the

shotgun, the rifle, and the handgun.

• 12 GURGE

the pigs use

G. Locally Stated Aims and Policy .

LARRI FONELL, member of the Detroit NCCE, conducted

the political education classes on July 5, 1970, at which time

the topic of discussion was the center page of the July 4,

1970, issue of "The Black Panther" newspaper. Those in

attendance were instructed as follows:

Whenever you say "death to the pigs" mean it.

Put your words into action.

Use the slogan "all power to

the people" as the pigs think they are the power.

Now We

have to add to our slogan "death to the pigs," so stop

talking and start putting your words into action. The pigs

so sthe pigs

are planning genocide against us.

The reason there are more

pigs in the connunity this year than last year is because

they are planning to get rid of all blacks, and they want all

blacks to move into the projects so all they would have to

do is put a fence around it and give them just enough money

to get food. They want to take everything away from us, but

we still have the power to destroy and there is no way the

pigs can destroy the BEP. If they kill us off, our struggle

will be taken up by the people in the community as we are

the people's party. If we don't go to the people then we

are not serving the people.

struggle is not confined

exists also in the south in the field of Civil Rights.

We have to fight for national salvation, deal with repression

and will fight for the liberation of all oppressed

peoples.

The Association of Black students, Oakland

University, Rochester, Michigan, sponsored a rally in

support of the Detroit 16 on November 16, 1970, featuring

HUEY P. HEWTON.

The main theme of the speech given by Huey ?.

NEWTON On November 16, 1970, at Oakland University, was that

all poor blacks and poor whites, the working classes, the

oppressed of the world, must all join forces as a united

body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.

NENTON repeatedly referred to this "ruling circle" through-

out his entire speech and apparently interpreted this "ruling

circle" as those leaders of Government and industry, the

imperialists or those who are rich in this society NEWTON

wanted eguality for everyone with no one being superior to

He indicated the legro is a class brother

with the poor

whites and they must join in their effort to

overcome the "ruling circle."

NEWTON stated, "The Black Panther Party is the

vanguard of the revolution on a world-wide level because the

world is really one community and we've taken Marxist-Leninist

to a greater leveland, therefore, we are the greatest

Marxist-Leninists that ever lived,. and we say this not to

be arrogant because some times I wish that someone else

would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the

burden is heavy."

In conclusion, the speech by NEWTON was a ranbling,

many times incoherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low-key

revolutionary type speech which attenpted to show

a connection

between the sPe

and

the League of Revolutionary Black Workers

(LRB.T), as well as a unity between the BPP and all oppressed

persons of the world.

A characterization of the IRBW is contained

in the appendix pages

attached hereto.

His speech called for the release of the Detroit 16,

freedom for ANGELA DAVIS, BOBBY SEALE, and all the oppressed

brothers and for the ultimate overthrow of the pigs.

The speech appeared to be rather poorly organized

and NEWTON was easily diverted from the main topics which

he seemed to be pursuing.

The speech had very few references

to añy actual radical action or violent confrontation.

The Black Student Union, University of Michigan,

Ann Arbos, Michigan, sponsored a rally in support of the

Detroit 16 on November 17, 1970, featuring HUrT NEWTON.

NEWTON stated that the working class will be the

ones to carry out the "revolution"

and carry the "revolution

banner" and will most likely initiate the croation of the

new order. Throughout his speech, NEwTON talked about the

new order which will occur when. the world is taken over by

Conmunism. Throughout the speech, NEWTON refers to capitalism

stating that while it has caused

many problems, it has also

laid the foundation for Connunism. He stated that the

wealthy are the ruling circle and named RCCRUFELLER and FORD

as being in this circle. NewiCh stated that they offered

troops to the Vietnamese people, however, did not get a

definite answer on their proposal.

individuals who had been given loitering tickets, apparently

in connection with their distributing NCCF literature.

Two unmarked patrol cars with plain clothes officers

responded and arrived in the area almost immediately, however,

a crowd had gathered and one of the officers was recognized

Then the officers attempted to leavethe area by driving across

a vacant lot, the car was hit by gunfire and one officer

suffered minor injuries.

IRBW has referred to the automotive industry and the JAW

as "racist".

second source advised that membership in the

IRBW is limited to Negroes only, by virtue of the IRBW

constitution which states "membership is denied to all

honkies due to the fact that said honkey has been the

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPF

also known as

Black Panther Party for Self Defense

According to the official

newspayer of the bPP, the BPP

was started during Deccmber, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life,

• politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was

•organized by BOBBY G. SLALE, BPF Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,

Minister of Defense, BPP..

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPP

advocates the use of guns

and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression

of the black people.

Residents of the black community are

urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an

article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America.

revolt everywhere!

Acm yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite! Black power. Use

• the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPp newspaper, issue a Catober 5, 1968, He WII!,

article introduced with the following statement:

not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the

kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"We advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force

and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had

an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials,

until the reactionary forces...are dead and these that

are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,

Oakland, California.

Branches of the BIP, and Conmittees to

Combat Fascism, under control of the BPP, have been established

in various locations in the USA..

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP) ,

also known as

Black Panther Party E01

£ Defense

According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP

was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can

take control of the life,

politics,

and the destiny of

the black community.

It was

organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUBY P. NEWTON,

Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression

of the black people.

Residents of the black comnunity are

urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an

article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

Arm yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite! Black power. Use

• the gun. Kill the

pigs everywhere."

article introduced with the following statement:

The Bep newspaper, issue of october 5, 1963 he vilE

not dissent from American government.

We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the

• San Francisco Polo Field on November

15, 1969, said "We will

kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"We advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force

and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had

an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as fOllows:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials.

until the reactionary forces... are dead and those that

are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."

The EPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,

Oakland, California.

Branches of the BEP, and Committees to

Combat Fascisin, under control of the Bif, have been established

In various locations in the ÜSA..

PROGRAMS AND POLICIES

On December 2, 1970, Detective WILLIAM HENNIAIAN,

Security Section, Intelligence Division, Detroit Police

Department, advised that he was contacted by the Detroit Edison

Electric Company, and advised that a crew from the electric

company went out to check the meter at 511 Continental,

Detroit, an NCCF office, which is on the rear of the house,

since a request for service had not been received, and found

that the meter had been jumped.

They were going to disconnect

the electricity at the meter but were chased away by occupants

of the house.

The electric company is not going to cut the

wire at the pole as they consider it too dangerous and are

going to let the NCCI have the electricity.

The Flint Chapter of the Detroit NCCP has begun

work on fortifying the

house at 2009 Albert, Flint, richigan,

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)

Iso known as

Black Panther Party for se

Defense

According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP

was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can

take control of the life,

politics,

and the destiny of the black community. It was

organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,

Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression.

of the black people.

Residents of the black community are

urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its

issue of September 7, 1968, had an

article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America.

revolt everywhere!

Arin yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite!

Black power. Use

the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an

article introduced with the following statement:

"We will

not aissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the

San Francisco Polo Field on November

15,

1969, said "we will

kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"He advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force

and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970,. the BPP newspaper had

an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follois:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this goveinment, killing the officials,

until the reactionary forces... are dead and those that

are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Poralta Street,

Oakland, California. Branches of the Bpp, and Committees to

Combat Fascism, under control of the BPE, have been established

in various locations in the USA.:

The association of Black Sturents, Oal-lend

Universitz: Rochestor, Michigan, sponsored

a rally in

support of the Detroit 16 on November 16, 1970, featuring

HUBY P. NOMICHA

HUSY P. NORTON is the Minister of

Defense, B?P.

The main theme of the speech given by Huby P.

NENTON on November 16, 1970, at Oakland University, was that

ali poor blacks and poor wites, the working classus, the

oppressed of the worid, must all join forces as a united

body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.

NENION repoacedly reforred to this "ruling circle" through-

out his entire speech and apparently interpreted this "ruling

circle" as those

leaders of Government and industry, the

imperialists or those who are rich in this

society.

NEWTON

wanted equality for everyone with no one being suparior to

his fellow man.

He indicated the Negro is a class brothei

with the poor whites and they must join in their effort to

overcome the "ruling circle."

NENTON stated, "The Black Panther. Party is the

vanguard of the revolution on a world-wido level because the

world is really one community and we've taken Marxist-leninist

to a greater level and, thererore, we are the greatest

Marxist-Leninists that ever livea,

and we say this not to

be arrogant because some times I wish that someone else

would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the

burden is heavy."

In conclusion, the speech by NEWTOw was a rambling,

many tires incoherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low-key

revolutionary type speech which attempted to show a connection

between the BeP

and the League of Revolutionary Black Forkers

(IREN), as well as a unity betrech the BPP and all oppreesed

persons of the world.

& characterization of the IRBW is containca

in the appendix pages actached hereto.

His speech called for the rclease of the Datroit io,

freedom for ANGELA DAVIS, BOBBY SEALE, and all the oppressed

brothars and for the ultimate overchrow of the pigs.

to any actual radical action or violent confrontation.

The Black Student Union, University of Michigan,

an Arbor, Michigan, sponsored a rally in support of the

Detroit 16 on November 17, 1970, featuring HULY NEWTON.

NEWTON stated that the working class will be the

ones to carry out the "revolution"

and carry the "rcvolution

banner" and will most likely initiate the creation of the

new order.

Throughout his speech,

NENTON talked about the

new order which will occur when the world is taken over by

Communism.

Throughout the speech, WENION refers to capitalism

stating that while it has caused many problems, it has also

laid the foundation for Communism. He stated that the

wealthy are the ruling circle and

named ROCKSFELLER and FORD

as being in this circle. NIWION stated that they offerred

troops to the Vietnamese people, however, did not get a

definite answer on their proposal.

But the founders of the Black Panther Party, led by fuey P. Nevion, knew

"Inat they bad to have more than their goals.

They had to understand how they

were going to achieve them. Huey's answer was "Serve the People" and "Picà up

the gun.

The Black Panthers realized that the people can be liberated only

by their

own efforts, and that the rantners nad to reach out to their community,

And they realized that "political porer

being moved down by the police and had to defend tbenselves, and that political

power over their community would never leave the hands of the rich and enter their

an hands unless they combatted the police--the army of the rich.

Huey first put his understanding of serving the people and picking up the

gun into practice yen he and Bobby Seale went out one night with a hammer

anâ & shot gun to put up a siop sign that was badly needed by the community.

Bohhy stood guard with the snot gun while Huey harmerea in the sign. Later,

the Panthers started many health clinics, breakfast for children prograns, and

- Dier conmunity services.

Because of what the Panthers want for their people, because they are going

isbout getting it, and because the cormunity is beginning to looks towards them for

Toleão, Philadelpuia, have been attackea and ransached by police officers.

now Detroit joinsthe list, just as the l.C.G.F. here was beginning to start a

free commity bealth clinic and to gain the support of the coumunity.

But the Panthers continue to grow and sink deeper and deeper roots amoug

the people.

And all. of us poor and working people, black and white, shoula be

glad, should defend the Panthers and help them grow. For the Panthers are

fighting the enemy of all poor and norising people:

of GM) who run this country and controi not ouly the black conmunity but all of

ADDRESS BY THE AL-FATEH DELEGATION TO THE

SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENGE IN SUPPORT

• OF THE ARAB PEOPLES

Cairo, January 1969

Friends,

In the naic of the people of Palestine, in the name of the

Palestinian Revolution, in the name of Justice and Peace for

which we fight, tre thank you for your concom and the concern

of your prople in Justice and l'cace in our part of the world.

We are very happy to have the opportunity to mect with you,

because you represcht people who fought for peace based on justiec.

We can see among you people who fought the Nazi invasion

and the fascist terror in kurope.

We also find among you people who fought, and are sill

fighting, imperialisnt and colonialism and racial discrimination

in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

We honestly fecl that we stand among friends and comrades

who believe in the right of every people to self-determination and

its right to enjoy liberty on its own land, free of oppression and

discrimination.

Our people were deprived of their rights to self-actenination

and to the enjoyment of life on their own land without oppression.

This was the rcsult of a scrious racist aggression carried out.ly

an imperialist organisation: Zionism.

The aggression of the 5th of June is one manifestation of this

basic aggression that had its roots in the l9th century, and whose

culmination was the establishment of the State of Isracl in 1948.

The major victim of this aggression was the Arab Palestinian people

who were forced to evacuate their homes and land under a reign

ofterror and oppression. .

We therefore refuse

lo consider the 1967 aggression as i

separate and distinct phenomenon, and we refuse to accopt any

colution focussed on the results of the last aggrestion

without

considering the source of the aggrecsion itself.

The Resolution of the Security Council, November 22nd 1967,

and all further proposals explaining or modifyng it, are inadequate

and irrelevant from our point of view, and thercfore are totally

aid categorically unacceptable to us.

All such proposals skirt the rea, issue and avoid its core,

namely: the right of the Palestinians to liberate their country, to

enjoy

ad and homes, and to have the right to decide how they

want

run.it.

We, the people of Palestine, are carrying on an armed revolu-

tion in order to re-establish peace with justice in the Holy Land.

We would like you to consider the magnitude of our problem.

For ive are facing a Zionist structure that had its roots in 19th

century Europe, at the heart of the imperialist movement. Zionism

is onc of the most oppressive and aggressive forns of imperialism,

one that has as its major goal the toial uprooting of one people

from a country to replace them by another.

The roots of the aggression lie in the Zionist ideology itself,

with its belicf in the nced to bring a select, chosen people without

a land, to a land that is to be evacuated by its inferior people.

methods used to accomplish this objective are terror,

OPPI

and deceit.

Lei me quote one of the original Jewish pioncers in Palestine,

Nathan Choshi, who wrote to the editor of the Jewish Newstolter

in February 1959:

"It y0u really wanted to know what happened, we old Jewish

setiler. in Palestine who witnessed the fight could tell you how

and in what manner we Jews forced the Arabs to leave cities

and villages...Some of them were driven out by force of arms;

other wire made to leave by deceit, lying and false promises.

trying to undo some of the evil we committed, by helping those

uniortunate religees, we justily our terrible acis and evea attempt

to glorify them."

' Professor Erich Fromm, the noted Jewish writer and thinker,

had this to add: "It is often said that the Arabs fled, that they left

the country voiuntarily, and that they therefore bear the responsi-

bility for losing their property and their land. But, in genera

international law, the principle holds true that no citizen loses hi

property or his rights of citizenship, and the citizenship right is:.

de facto right to which the Arabs in Palestine have much more

legitimacy than the Jews. Just because the Arabs fled? " Professor

Fromm asks. "Since when is that punishable by confiscation of

property and by being barred from returning to the land on which

a people's forefithers have lived for generations? The claim of

the Jews to the land of Isracl cannot be a rcalistic political claim.

If all nations would suddenly claim territories in which their

forefathers have lived two thousand ycars ago this world would

be a madhouse."

* * *

The Zionists went ahead coldbloodedly with their sinister

scheme to vacate Palestine of its people, by the use of terror,

massacres and frightening rumors.

Arthur Koestler, the pro-Zionist author, described what

happened at Deir Yassin on April Oth, 1918, as the "blood bath

that was the psychologically decisive factor

in the Arabs'

spectacular exodus."

On that day, the Zionist terrorist organization Irgun Zvei

Leumi killed 250 men, woren and children. After 1948 there

were other mass killings in occuped Palestine, c.g. Ikrit (1951), Al

Tira (1953), Abu Ghosh (1953), Kaff Kassem (1956), cic., as

part of the systematic Zionist plan for the complete evacuation

of the Palestinians, to be replaced by Jewish settlers from all

over the world.

These were the conditions that forced the Palestinians to leave

their homeland.

The Zionists did notcome to a country without people. There

lived in Palestine a people with a civilization. They reicred is the

Zionist challenge by education, economic and human mobilization,

and competed with the 'Zionists in the fields of management;

finance and technology-

With all their efforts, by 1917 the Zionists had only been

able lo acquire 5.6% of the total area of Palestine. However, the

1947 U.N. resolution for partition allowed them 56% of Palestine,

and by terror and aggression they went on to occupy 80% in

1948. Today, after the June 5 1967 aggression, the rest o our

¡occupica, as well as Sinni and the Golan Heights.

For twenty ycars, the Palestinians were the victims of world

procrastination. While many resolutions were passed in the United

Nations, the Israclis continued to occupy more and more territory

while the world remained indiltront. Under such conditions, the

only alteruative left to the Palestinians was armed revolution.

I ain sure that the facis of the case are very clear to you. You

can visualize the conditions under which our people have suffered.

For tent: years most of the t lestinians hase lived in a claspora

of shabb tents, anisery and the humiliation of a meager dolc. In

this schizophrenic world of at the rights of Africas, Asians and

Polynesi, is were recognized and espoused, while Palestinian rights

were disit tidied and forgotten. Not even the tragedy of the heroic

ons; South Africans and Zimbabwans equallod theirs. For,

alot

ing these oppressed people, the Palestinians were totally

uproo: id, from their land and completcly denied the right to live

on it and enjoy its fruits.

Our people have risen to arms because all other means have

been exhausted. We refuse to accept raiscry and diaspora as our

fate, and

ive refuse charity and compromise as solutions to our

problem. We shall overcome: througi a long-term liberation

rovolution to destroy the bases of colonialist aggression that frustrate

the exercise of our inalienable rights, and to bring an ead to the

racist militarist regime that oppresses our propic. We, will fight so

rusty weapons and against heavy odds, our youth embarked on

the revolution with all the deterrination and persistence of a long-

oppressed people. Now as we emback on our fifih year of struggie,

the fruiis of our sacrifices are beginning to show. The Palestine

Liberation Movement has succeeded in awakening our people,

in rekindling its hope for a better future with dignity and respect

in our own land. We are forcing the enemies of peace to admit

their failure to extinguish our revolution, we are winning battles,

and ic are starting to shape our dustiny.. We are not swayed by

emotional appeals, we are not seckers of revenge, we are not

bloodthirsty terrorists. We are freedom fighters with clear and

mature goals. We are fighting today to create the new Palustine

of tomorrow: A progressive, democratic, secular Palestine in

which Christian, Josiem and Jew will worship, work, live peacefully

and erjoy equal rights. This is no utopion dream or false promise,

for we have always lived in peace, Moslems, Christians and Jess

in the Floly Land. The Palestinian Arabs gave a refuge, a warm

shelter and a helping hand to Jows fleeing persecution in Christian

Europe and to the Armenians flecing persecution in Mostem

Turkey, as wellas to Greeks, Circassians and Maltese among others.

Onr Palestinian revolution still stretches its welcoming hand

to all human beings who want to fight for, and live in, a democ-

ratic, tolerant Palestine, itrespective of race, color or religion.

During the last four years, some 500 of our people have given

their lives on the baitlefield. During the same period many more

than that have died in refugee camps from bitter cold, poor nourish-

mont and disease.

We are heic to assert to you, and to ask you to confirm to

your peopic, that our people will not lay down their arms until

Palestine is liberated and our rights restored. We will not accept

any settlement that denies us those rights, be it the Security

Council's resolution, or any other proposal or political settlement

ensuing from it. We will not accept any substitute to a war

of national liberation and vill tenaciously hold to it regardless of

sacrifices and costs. Could anybody have asied you to accept

anything less than total freedom from Nazism, fascisin or colonia-

lism? We are confident the people of the world will back our

struggle and will support our revolution, for it is the struggle of

man to achieve the loftiest of man's values: neace and jusries

Translator's Introduction

This dialogue was conducted with "Abi-amar"

by lalal Salman,

a lobaneso journalist who visiton

the sudayeen besos and iodo a serios of articlas in

al-saryad, a Labsnese reokly regazine.

The first

article,

"Dialogue with Abu mar", appeared in

al-Sayyad on January ?, 2209.

Tho erticle is an important document because

it presents the ideas and thoughts of the loader of

al-Patch in a comprehonsive manner.

"Abu-Amar" disa

cusses the ideas of the hovencht in clear torm, ami

attompts to ansver critico by mucher explaining

the

Movenonù's stand on certain ambiguous questions.

A number of importarü ideas are clarified in

chis article. First, the enorgence of "yalestinian

identity" as an irdeconsent force, edurting arcad

strugglo to rogain the "lard" and contront the

Imperialisi prescroo. Second, Fateh's relation to

Arab purormonts is clarifiod.

sAbu-imari stresser

that tho rovement does not intoriore in the local

ralitios of the Arab goverments. It depends on

popular support and on the masses for mustection.

Faton seeks a certain indopendence and in that senue

ii interfares in the utairs of arab States: by

existing on their territory, by moving rooly, ni

by exarcising the right to lighe for liberation of

the occupied torritorios.

Thira, Patch appears as

a unifying forco, since its bases exist in most

Arab statos and its men more frooly inon one siate

to another, Fateh, therefoco, works against

TegonaLism and pooLes trio unity an accon

rouch, the quostion of i600logy oi loftist vs.

rightist contraversy is clarifies.

"Abil-/maz"

stresses that all Fatch men aro of tie brotched of

the earth sinco thoy lach the means for existence.

porcover, this 1s a stazo of "Ilberation strugglo,":

thero actions are moro important than words, and

moro efforts of all Flostinians aro needal.

Faten has its crientation, honover, and in terms

of arred struggla against Imperialish, it is more

leftist than iho Soviet Union and the Arab

Cormunist partios. Disagrosment betwoon Communist

partios and Fateh exist over proposals for scoaca

ful settlonent" of the conflict, for Fateh rojects

any

iceful settlemonts and believes in armed

str

¿ as tho only solution.

At this stage of Arab history, Fateh Ideas

ara sonular and rogresent a turning point in Arab

thought. Thoy rogresent tho boginning of a now

Arab ra-awakoning, an attempt aù the redefinition

of the arab boing in terris of armod struggle.

Fateh spearheads this ro-awakening, it is the

vanguard of the revolution, and it leads by action

and aried strugglo.

Faion is thus the antithosis of Arab "revolu-

tionary" thought, which was linited to slogans

and devoid of any action in the form of armed

struggle. Fateh is action und armod strugglo, ard

This article is the product of an open dis

he knew people in Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; seattle,

regarding such an organization, feeling that they would be

highly interested in helping to organize and get it going.

He said his plans included having Post Office boxes rented

for the new organization in all these cities and having

leaflets and stickers regarding the organization printed

using the respective Post office box numbers.

On a pre-determined

day, press releases would be made in each of these cities

announcing the formation of the organization with the leaflets

This would be done for the purpose of disguising the location

of the national headquarters, which would be actually located

in San Diego, California.

Dear Fellow American,

At the request of a mutual friend we are sending you this invitation in

join the Secret Army Organization. Those.of us who have been merabers for

some time sincerely believe that our organization can be of real vahie in pre-

serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our

forefsthers landed down to us.

It is the belief of our organization that the communist-socialist coi-

spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an ertent that the

• American people cannot rely on this counteg's clected leaders to protect then

from communist domination and slavery.

We believe that the time will come when the American people will have

to fight for their lives, and their liberty. In this belief, we have formed in

advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-

stitutional republic and to help our feilow Americans to do the same.

We do no want lukewarm members. We are an organization of people

willing to make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the samo

way, we invite you to join us.

o Secret Army Orgenizatiou

One carly morning in February, 1070, a group of dis MInutemon leaders fron:

four sintos met secrolly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonmont of two top Al nutemen loaders and me ascascinationof a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these nen had met. before in their rolcs

as Minuchen grpup leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

Aftcr much discussion, two principal pointe wore agrocd upon. First, thai the

Mimiten.en as & national coordination organization of mililant right-wing groups had

eflectivoly been destroyed by the pro-cominanis elements inside the Justice Depart-

mant. While individual mits still existed throughout the country, few had the financial.

support on leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating orgarization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolitionary acuvity

by communists in the United Stales.

With

these to points in mind, suggestions wore pul forwasd on a course of

action to be Jollowed.

Aften a inecting that lustod ali that day and far into the next

morning, an orgrail plan of actio!; was finally agaced upon. All present agreed to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elecied from among theinoclves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the now loader.

While zetaining the basic programs

and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

completchy do chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-

tion was

going to survive the altacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would he needed. Never again could the acrestor death of a few leaders he allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For tis renson it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with & definite chainofcommand would have any chance of success. This

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Sccret Army O

anization is the most active, most sample ely dedicaice and

most selective in iis membership of all the many patriotic organisations in America.

We are willing; to make any sacritice for our country and we fully expect that some of

us will bave to make the ultimite suezitice bofore victory is achiered. Our vory lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarn concervatives. It you join the Scoret Army Orgunization, there night easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

learned his job.

Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political

situation, it, is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat ond nation

faces. Unless

you have had many yetes exparionce in actual underground wouft:,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supcrvised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN INIMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, ou

nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists.

Io prevent this we must

know as much as possible aboui our enemies. Unloss we know who they are and what

they äre doing we will not succeed in our efforts to innintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages ul development.

1) The Underground Netivork

2) Active Guerrilla Waclare

3) -Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional wartare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that le

enemy does but must alsohave acu ve guerrillas andunderground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactios conventionai wartare cannot

suceoed unless these other two ingredients are used simultancously.

The first step is to forman underground network. An active guerrillasystcm

must have the suppor of an undergreud network of approximalely tree times iis own

$14.0.

This underground

must supply the active gucrrilla fighter with supplies,

ccalment, information, ric. An underground notork staris with departments o l

intelligener, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabolago, espionage,

Look at it this may,

Suppose you had spent a bear me more carefully recruiting and

training until reu had a hard bitting team where every individunt was reliable, dedi-

cated, aud had condenee in his fellow unit members. Wookit it make you mad to

have the nationai ne regioual organication assigu some tank amateur to your unit

that you you know little of nothing aboul?

Before any new member is assignato an notive unit de to an important under-

ground project, he mustundergo a period of training. Daring this training he will le

directed through the mails by an osperienced memberandsome of his activities may

bo obserred lj other"

menbers"without his knowledge. Only when a new member

proves himsell to be conscientious, trud brothy, soil-disciplined and able to operate

eftoctively alone will'he be accepted as i "secure member" and invited to participale

with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

EXPENSES

Unfortunatoly, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the SecretArmy Organization, you

musi expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Armly Organization are $3. Du per mouth. This money is

absolitely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, lor

postage and printing, to linance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain

training areas.

Each member will hage other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, ammunition and

other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy coctain booke or sabscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the now member will also be suppliedwith reading material on the strategy

and tactles of guercilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to

üit in quickly to an active unit and participate elfectively in actual mancuvers,

marksmanship training, elc.

Following this

preliminary training a momber may be either assigned to an

existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient loadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

dclinite series of projects described in writing so you will know oxactly what will be

exported di iris.

THE COATTEAR

General Outline

The "Combat Toam" is the stulost onganicutional rait used by the Scoret

Army Organization. When organized in the propor manor it is capable of opera

tionalinitiative when detached from the parent orgarianoa. When dovcloped to

its highesi degree of efficioney the Combat Team is almost totaliy self-suificient

and able to performany one of severei missions. do atlain these aims the follow-

ing elements ate essential:

Edipment should be well-chosso wri standardised as mich as pos-

sible,

b.

Communications, internal and external, must be capable of rapid

trsusmission, be varied in nature, and be exercised with primo

emphasts on security.

c.

Internal coordmation shouid be automatic in response. Contidence

among members of the team must be developed.

d.

Selection of each position on the team should be based onpsycholng-

: ical aspects ze well as tochnical compatence.

Training of the men in each function should be at roguine intervals

and continuous. Field problems should be given dry runs in detail.

f.

The logistios problem should bestudied with care, and made simple

and direct.

"g.

Each team will have a"leader" (Lieutenant) and an "assistant louder"

(Sergeant). These men shall be given special training by the Secret

Army Organization at "leadership seminars".

Team. "marsholling points" should be selected in advance and be

well defined. Pructice "alerts" will determine the team's etficiency

in response and security.

i.

Terrain familiarity within the expected operational radius of the

team must be developed.

Weapons familiarity mestboobtai.ed throughlivefirings at various

targets. Team action must be strossed as well as individual com-

petence.

ks.

The team louder should sue that a constani flow of information is

provided to team semiers on the ideologieni strugele. This will

help induee the proper frume of mind in each member.

1.

Team missions and targets must be identified and the proper train-

ing equipment made available for sach assignment.

The icam

siving the overall,

sceurity of the unit. Personal feelings should not affoct decisions

involving reprimandor dismissalof men from the leam for roasons

that endanger its operation or security.

Ii. • Intelligence gathering as un important part of each team menber's

duties should be stressed. Information on the location and move-

ments of local communist and Icit-wing cucintes of the organization

should be sent to either Regional or General Headquarters.

The toam Icaders will be rosponsible in maintaining contact with

higher commund and for the transmission of orders from same,

ORGANIZATION

The "Combat Team" will consist of six me. Those six mon will be divid-

ed into two sub-teams (Sections). Number One Scotion will consist of the Team

Lieutenant and two other team members. Number Two Section will consist of the

Team Sergeant and the two remaining team members. When completely assembled

the uit will act directly under the command of the Team Lieutenant. When split

into sectious the Team Sergeant Will carry out the orders of the Team Licutchant

during missions, but will be in inmediate command of the Nuber Two Section,

In the absence of the Tear Lieutenaut the Sergeant will take command of the Unit.

TRANSPORTATION

Transportation of the Combat Team will be effocted by the use of tivo ear-

riers.

Interception and/or destruction of one carrier will not, then, iminobilize

the team. In addition, each carrier can serve as a scouting element for the other.

Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possihie and still serve their

purpose. Jeeps and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are

owned and used commonly by the general populalion or where the terrain makes

their use necessary. Most often an ordinary passenger ear will suffice. Tha

model selected should have a good road clearance so it can be used on dirt roads.

Tire chains (if needed), hydraulic jacks, extra gas, water, and suitable tools

should be stored in the vehicie.

TRAVEL PROCHDURES

Underway, Carrier #1 will lead and Carrie? #2 will trail, The "interval"

will vary with conditions.

In cities slost-aboard trailing willbe used. Open road,

ky day, will require an interval of approximaicly 300 yards. At night this will

be reduced to approximately 100 yards. During travel, all equipment (espocially

arms and ammunition) should be kept did of sight. Speciai icam equipmont and

weapons should be locked in the trunk of the chicle until noeded. The trunk key

should he carefuily hidden se as to make it difficul to soarch the trunk in case

law enforcement agonis should stop the car on some protest with the intention of

searching it illegaliy.

Dear Follow American,

Enclosed with this farter is your Poolinicory Traindg Program. Tiis

first program is only a buer outline ot como if the material that will be cover-

ed in later programs. There are four basic programs used by the Secret Army

Organization: Intelligence, Security, Propaganda, and Recruiting, in that

order. Each progzam will dost the new membor sa. 00 and will take betveen

one to throe weeks to complote.

The correspondeyes teaning program serves a number of purposes,

but the two major purposes are:

1. It lets us law which members uf the organzaten have the padence

and detormidation io finish assiguments givon them.

2. It leis us be certain that the members have the necessary basic

training in intelligence, security, etc., Which is essential to al-

most any important task which we could assign a member in under-

ground wartare.

Proper training in these four basic skilis is absolutely essential for

every mener or an underground army. A member may be an expost in 32-

vival techniques, use of weapons, urban wartare tactics and ali the rest bat

experionce has shown that without these other basic skill: they seldom do nuch

fighiing - they juat cormit suicide.

For those of you who wish lo bucome active and trusted members of the

Secret Army Organisation, let us ciphasir: again tont the guckes: way of do-

ing so is to begin and diligently compiete the basic tzaining programs.

Aftes you have comploted thó Over uck projects listed in the Preliminary

Training Program send $8.00 in to your regular mai drop and we will send you

the first trainisg peogram on Intelleonce.

In view c? tie urgent situation we

now face some of our new mombors spy recohe speciel assignments after

having completed the frai lie training proscars. If this boppens please try

Underground warfare, as we customarily think of it, canol sucecod unless it

is supported by a voli developed ongo ivation comprising all the essential functions

of intolligone, scourio, propaganda, commendeatious, supply, medical services,

=.

Ot all these, intelligence is most important. let's consides ne example:

Suppose you picket up a telephone book, eponed it as to any page at random: closed

your egos and purous finger on odd namo.

Nos suppose you read that name for

the first time and aud to yourself, "Condime in the next 30 days I'm goingio kill

this man."

Consider the situntion - one man, picked at random is marked for death. la

none of thes teings woul belp him in the lous!. Fio would be defenaeless. Why?Bo-

cause you would have one thing that he did not have - intelligenee. You would know

his identity and he would not know you's. So long as thai condition continued, there

would be no pessible way in which he could arrangè an adequate defense againsi you.

Exactly the same situation exists hetwoon curselves aud our communist and

socialist enemies. Our success will he directly proportionate to our looniedge of

them aod inversely proporcionate to their knowleage of us.

Whatever a member's principal job may be in the Secret Army Orgunization,

he must have & basic Inowledge oi intolligence lechniques. This subjeci is there-

fore the first to be considered in our training program.

methods that can be used to gain useful information. We usually think of this as

knowledge of the enemy bui it also ircludes information about tho tezrain, gouchal

population, availohle supplies and all other facts that will help in planing future

Intelligence is roughly divided into Miree parts:

1. Obscevation. During a hot at this includos scouting and palaollas,

obscraton of coom: troop morements, de. On the cold war front this inelmies

shadowing of enemo personnel, surveillence of coomy ofticers, lapping of telcphones,

advantage wüt be lost unless we can keep our plans and activities secret from them.

The 16 the basie propose of all socurity activities. Overall secruity opcrations of

an underground movement can be divided into five basic parts:

1. Protecting the identity of underground personnel and their familico.

2. Keeping socrot the lccation, movemenis andplans of undergecund units.

3. Keeping secret the location of endanground headquarters, alteracio

hidcouts and supply depois.

4. Protecling the identily of civiliaus, or individual members of the gopi-

Jation that are friendly te indengzound forces.

We are faced with a dangerous chemy who has repeatedly boasted of his

plans to destroy our Constitutional Republic and to ensiars our pooplo.

For more than fourty years they have been intilt ating their agents into

tho most sensitive areas of labor, press, entortainment, education, law, coni-

munications, religion, industry and government. The degrec of their success

is made obvious by our governmont's flurelo Oppose communism internation-

ally and by ou fellow citizens' lack of interest in thoir own prcservation.

We already know a considerable amouni about this enemy; their origin,

objectives, approsimate strength, orgmizational structure and goneral meth-

ods of operation.

There ars four areus where we especially nocd ariditonal information.

1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infloration and subver-

sion by individual ageuts, including the methous by which thoy control their

fellow travelers.

2o The equipment used for suaveillance, communication, assassination,

sabotage, etc., by individual enemy agents.

3. Worksing details of their short zange programs either in operation or

planned for the near future.

4. The actual identily of enemy agents, fellow travelers and sympathi-

zens along with details regarding their work, place of residchoe, cover opora-

as to the size of the demonstration and degree of violenoc anticipated must be

obtained by infilirating such organizations. Communist plans for future propa

stacy of their past activities.

4, Identity and personal information aboul enomy agents.

NK 157-2011

On March 1, 1974, DRAGER. and CARROLL were released

on bond from the Sagamon County Jail. The subject's vehicle,

a 1970 Ford pickup truck, with a camper truck unit, was left

by DRAGER at the Sheriff's Impound Lot.

On March 6, 1974, NK T-2 advised he obtained information

that FRANK DRAGER had visited ROBERT DE PUGH Titular, Head of

the Minutemen Organization, in Norborne, Missouri.

The Minutemen organization was organized

in 1960, reportedly to resist the spread of

communism in the United States by use of

guerrilla tactics. Robert B. DePugh, national

coordinator of the Minutemen, was sentenced in

October, 1970, for violations of the Federal

Firearms Act.

At the time of his arrest DePugh

was

in possession of documents concerned with

Juerrilla warfare and other paraphernalia, includin

and grenades.

gun silencers, and

a machine gun.

DePugh was released on parole during April, 1973,

and in June, 1973, 'indicated he planned to revitalize

the Minutemen into a "two-armed organization".

Arm number one was to be utilized as a political

front organization to sway elections and control

local and state political structures.

Arm number

two was to be an underground guerrilla organization

made up of "strike teams". These "strike teams"

are to be under direct control of DePugh and their

existence is to be unknown to

everyone, including

Minutemen State Coordinators.

After leaving Norborne, DRAGER was arrested in

Springfield, Illinois.

DRAGER was scheduled to proceed to

Columbus, Ohio to meet with JOHN GERHARDT, Leader of the American

White Nationalist Party (AWNP) and was to

continue to Reading,

Pennsylvania, to meet with ROY FRANKHOUSER.

DRAGER was supposedly carrying a message from DE PUGH

to GERHARDT and FRANKHOUSER.

GERHARDT and his brother, ED

GERHARDT, are leaders of the AWlP in Columhus, Ohio.

The GERHARDT'S

and a JAMES THOMPSON were arrested for shooting the homes of

school officials in Columbus, Ohio, JAMES THOMPSON allegedly

turned stated witness against

The GERIARDI

coordinator of the Minutemen and

ROY FRANKHOUSER to make plans to prevent THOMPSON's testimony and

have discussed possible execution.

NK 157-2011

GERHARDT he had

a man who was unknown and could take care of

THOMPSON. This

individual is believed to be FRANK DRAGER.

CONFIDENTAL SOURCE OF INFORFAATAON

on March 1. 1914, dr

quarters, Dean Reef cLube OPANN TAMES PRODRICK, StatE

Key, Largo, Florida, advised

DRAGER and

he, have been

long time friends having met in Trenton,

New Jersey. BRODERICK stated DRAGER claims to be "acting dragon'

in the Ku Klux Klan and was known to him to have close links with

the United Klan Leader ROBERT SHELTON. He further advised DRAGER

did carry some type of firearm with him on his person at most times.

CONFIDENTINE SOURSE DE INFARAJATION

On May 16, 1974, BRODEReK was recontacted by Special

Agents of the federal Bureau of Investigation at the Que morat

DRAGER have a small arsenal of weapons, primarily

automatic rifles. All or most part of these guns are stolen.

The arsenal consists of three satchels, one belonging to FRANKHOUSER,

the other :to DRAGER and the third to both. Apparently only

FRANKHOUSER knows their present whereabouts.

CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE OF INFORMANDAL

BRODERIGkalso stated that while in Florida City,

DRAGER told him that he and CARROLI had stolen the checks made

out to the Marathon Cay Sal Billfish Tournament and had been

cashing them in the Florida Keys area.

According to DRAGER,

CARROt committed the actual theft, while DRAGER waited in his

truck nearby.

GOURDENTIAt SOURCE-OF INFORMATION

DRAGER also told BRODER quring that Florida City

meeting, that he had purchased an automatic rifle in Miami.

On April 22, 1974, a tape cassette case with tape

cassette inside was received at FBI Headquarters enclosed in a

white envelope, bearing notation "20 April 1974; 85th birthday

of Adolf Hitler; thought you guys might like to hear from us.

FRANK DRAGER, WILLIAM CARROLL, National Revolutionary Army."

The speaker on the tape claims to be FRANK DRAGER.

• An examination

of the envelope by the Identification Division revealed three

fingerprints of subject, FBI Numer 405-550-E.

Copies of this

tape was also sent to the "Trentonian Newspaper", Trenton, New

Jersey, and the

"United Press International"

, in New Orleans,

Louisiana, as a press release for the National Revolutionary

Army (NRA). This tape in transcript form is set forth below:

"I had originally planned for this communication to

be typewritten, but since I stole this tape recorder, I guess

it's just as appropriate as a letter.

Clarence Kelley, Director of the FBI,

Washington, I. C.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

I had always praised the thoroughness of the FBI,

even though on scores of occasions you've permitted your

paranoia and your lack of human understanding could foul. you

up. Your drooling excitement and your paranoic stupidity and

your fruitless eagerness at having Frank Drager in your grimy

grubs in Springfield, Illinois, make super idiots of the

Federal Bureau of Integration.

You now realize how many

foolish errors you;made. In the near future you will be em-

ployed by the new natural government of America rather than

the Jew Justice Department and such supidity will not be

tolerated. How ridiculous for a gang of trained investigators

to be fooled and beaten by a teenager. Have you idiots put

all the pieces together yet? Whether or not you have, we both

thank God for your paranoid stupidity for now we are free to

continue tying together the few remaining loose ends which

will permit the National Revolutionary Army to eliminate

criminal Jewish control of America.

Now our armies can con-

tinue to join forces to eliminate this alien enemy government.

Continue your search for Frank Drager and Bill Carroll. It'll

be useless and frustrating. If you are lucky enough to capture

one of our soldiers in the future, beware, there's a speeding

soft-nose for all of our enemies.

we will have to deal with these Agents ruthlessly until they

Now our goals are within our grips and our armies are beginning

to activate. A large segment of the left and the right are no

longer shooting at each other. Yes, the fear of our enemies

is now realistic.

The bullets of all pro-American revolution-

aries are aimed at the alien enemies in control and not at

each other. Summer is near.

Federal Agents beware.

We mean

laws don't bother us; your jails don't

bullets will be returned with nore bullets® us; and your

Your leaders have

bankrupted our people, have starved them, and caused enough

materialistic havoc that we now have the will of the people

with us. Even the stupidist in America see through the grain

shortages, fuel shortages, price gougings, meat shortages,

work stoppages, and various other criminal corruption by the

eremy aliens in control.

America's masses are in the corner.

Now just stand back and watch them come out shooting. When the

smoke clears, America shall be the victor.

"The following portion of this communication will

be the only press release of the New Revolutionary Army. In

future months, as our movenent gains momentum, I wish for the

press to understand what we are about rather than what the FBI

tells them. There is a brief but somewhut inclusive listing

of our program included.

The New Revolutionaxy Party herewith immediately de-

clares that the present Government of the United States of

America is an illegal confederation of aliens and enemies of

the people of America.

The New Revolutionary Army, its officers

and followers henceforth secede from the United States of

America until such time we may be able to restore a Government

of the people, by the people and for the people and oust the

enemy aliens now in control. Through force and violence and

whatever means available to the NRA, we will totally, forcefully

and quickly restore sanity to our American republic.

We have .

adopted the American Constitution in its original form, revised

the Bill of Rights, and eliminated or revised all the amend-

ments to the Constitution.

We have formed a national caucus

of the hundreds of known and unknown political leaders whose

present identity will remain anonymous, who at the time the

enemy aliens perish or relinquish control, will imnediately

be brought before the American voter to seize popular control

of vacant political offices.

We of the NRA are the people, we speak for the

people, and we will violently eliminate America's enemies

with the haste of a speeding bullet. The NRA has chosen for

its spokesman a well-known adversary for the return of America

to a natural social order. The revolutionaries of the NRA are

ordered to maintain in every way possible or to avoid detection

by the enemy, but are ordered not to deny their association if

at such time they are detected by the enemy or captured. All

NRA members and associates are instructed that if captured they

are governed by the laws set at the Geneva Conference for cap-

tured soldiers and prisoners of war. This is by all means a

declaration of war

The enemies of white America will fall

like flies at a Raid party.

The following is a very brief synopsis of the goals

of the NRA once we seize power.

• :

#1.

•A11 non-whites immediately loose citizenship

and prepare for repatriation.

#2. The Federal Reserve will be abolished and all

illegal tender returned and it will be replaced with legal

notes once citizenship is confirmed.

#3. Israel immediately declared an illegal enemy

state.

#4..

Immediate deportation of all Jews, either

racial or religious.

DRAGER also requested the group to cause incidents

such as explosions on July 4, 1974, so a group he is forming

called the NRA could take credit for it. DRAGER stated he was

going underground and would use the code name somal.

DRAGER was known to have stayed at AL LENTZ' residence

from June

31 1974 to June 6, 1974.

On June 15, 1974, NK T-2 advised that in conversation

with a Ku Klux Klan member in Philadelphia, it was learned six or

seven individuals met at the home of AL LENTz, on June 5, 1974,

in York, Pennsylvania. All in attendance represented a small group

of independent Ku Klux Klan members and several Indiana representatives

of the Minutemen. FRANK DRAGER was in attendance and discussed his

plans for the forming of a group called "NRA" and the source also

developed information

that DRAGER was planing to blow up two city

On July 2, 1974, Mr. ROX ERAUKHOUSER was interviewed by

Special Agents of the FBI

in the presence of his attorney.

FRANKHOUSER

obtaining fuses for timing devices for explosives and requested

further assistance in several projects. FRANKHOUSER stated he

declined in both cases.

DRAGER stated

he had looked into the Gubow

matter in Michigan, and indicated he and his group were going to kill

Judge GUBOW. DRAGER stated he had been to Michigan and

"cased"

the judge's

home.

DRAGER stated he tried to contact the wife of

Reverend ROBERT MILES, in Michigan, but she would not talk to him.

DRAGER stated the only reservation he had about killing Judge GUPON

was whether or not it would effect the appeal of Reverend MILES.

convicted for the bombing of school buses in Pontiac, Michigan.

FRANKHOUSER stated DRAGER also stated he was going to take

to show them

"we mean business".

FRANKHOUSER then stated that DRAGER indicated he had a

"caper" planned that would meant $100,000.00. DRAGER did not

further discuss the caper.

FRANKHOUSER concluded on his own that

the "caper" was possibly a bank robbery. FRANKHOUSER denied any

specific knowledge regarding any bank robberies on DRAGER's part.

FRANKHOUSER stated he was contacted by DRAGER via telephone

call on one occasion subsequent to June 7, 1974 meeting. At this

time, DRAGER indicated two of his men had been arrested

group called the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) • CARROLL

related the following information:

He stated he met FRANK DRAGER in the presence of a

THOMAS MIDDAUGH prior to the summer of 1973. MIDDAUGH was

described as his close friend and they both attended a

Ku Klux Klan (KKK) rally in Upper New Jersey, at which time

MIDDAUGH introduced him to DRAGER. DRAGER is known to be the

legal guardian for MIDDAUGH. He was much impressed by the

zeal and philosophy of FRANK DRAGER and immediately became

his close friend and associate. Even though it was later

learned by CARRQLL that DRAGER was a homosexual, he decided

to be tolerant of this fact and they would continue to travel •

together and expound their right wing philosophy.

He stated he felt he had quite a bit to do with

FRANK DRAGER re-joining the right wing element. He stated

that they talked a lot about how the right wing could change

the country and felt they could work together as a highly

proficient team.

He stated that many of their activities were

They then went to the Jersey Shore where BRODERICK

and DRAGER obtained employment at the Captain Courageous Bar.

BRODERICK and DRAGER were known to have stolen numerous checks

from the Captain Courageous Bar and passed these checks to

, obtain money to travel to Florida.

In September of 1973, he, DRAGER and BRODERICK were

arrested in Toms River, N.J., in what he felt was a "set up".

He stated he believed the FBI had made their presenceknown to

the local authorities so the local authorities would arrest

and harass them for the FBI.

The three of them made bail and

purchased 40 pounds of marijuana and lefc for Florida in

FRANK DRAGER's camper truck.

They took several jobs under

assumed names, working as dishwashers and cooks. BRODERICK

then took a job at the Ocean Reef Beach Club in Key Largo, Fla.

He and DRAGER also worked there for a short time but were

fired.

• During

this period of time, DRAGER purchased ar

M-1. Carbine and

₫ .45 caliber automatic pistol while ir

Florida.

He and DRAGER then travelled to New Orleans,

where they made a drug buy and stole a .32 caliber handgun

from a drug pusher on the New Orleans waterfront.

After making several right wing contacts, they left

New Orleans and travelled to Springfield, Ill., to meet

other right wing sympathizers.

On their journey, they had

nates of the nik and robea

Minutemen.

SHELTON and DE PUGH promised fuli Support for the

NRA, which CARROLL stated was the same as the White Action

Movement founded by DRAGER several years ago at Trenton, N.J.

DON ZINN in Michigan.

CARROLL indicated that during their

travels they is constantly seeking weapons, ammunition, and

manuals on gorillà warfare.

estrialin

While in Springfield, Ill., in February, 1974, they

were arrested

for possession of marijuana, burglary tools,

and dangerous weapons.

CARROLL again advised he felt the

FBI had something to do with this arrest and expressed the

thought that possibly DE PUGH was an informant or else the

FBI had seen them with DE PUGH and followed them to the

Location of their arrest. CARROLL stated he used the ilentification

of THOMAS MIDDAUGH inasmuch

as he thought the FBI and the

Florida authorities had wasrants for he and DRAGER.

DRAGER obtained bail money for them and upon their

release from jail they tried

to obtain the camper truck back

but were advised by the local authorities it was going to be

used as evidence in their pending case.

Inasmuch as they had no transportation, they then

hitchhiked from Springfield, Ill., to York, Pa., where they

visited with AL LENTZ.

They then proceeded to

Trenton, N.J.,

and obtained a rental car which they did not return.

CARROLL

indicated they then left the Trenton area and went to Boston,

Mass., in efforts to get him.

a driver's license.

While in

Boston they tried to cash several more Captain Courageous

checks but were not successful, inasmuch as everybody

required photographic identification.

After having left Boston, Mass., they travelled to

Washington, D.C., and visited a SKYLER FERRIS (phonetic).

They

tried to obtain maps of the sewer system of Washington, D.C.,

from him. FERRIS was advised of their plans to bomo the

Internal Revenue

'Service (IRS) and at first FERRIS was not

agreeable.

FERRIS was then guaranteed that the local authorities

would be advised of the bomb a half hour prior to its detonation

on July 4, 1974.

FERRIS was agreeabla to this plan and

supplied them with the diagram of the sewer system.

FERRIS

is further known to be a right wing patriot and supplied

names of local patriots to DRAGER.

After departing Washington, D.C., they travelled

to Florida and visited with an ORVILLE LIPPERT.

They then proceeded to Alabama where they registered

the vehicle they stole in Trenton, N.J.

They then travelled

back to York, Pa., and saw AL LENTZ again.

They, visited

several days with LENTZ and then returned to Trenton, N.J.,

where they looked up a JAMES KEITH, who is known to be a

close friend of JAMES BRODERICK.

They requested him to find

them an apartment which they could rent for several weeks

the 4

prior to their planned July 4 attempt to bomb the IRS,

Washington, D.C.

KEITH, DRAGER, and he were going to the Florence

Motel in Florence, N.J., to move into a room they had rented.

DRAGER was dropped off at an Acme Market to buy groceries

inasmuch as there was not room in the vehicle for the three

of them and groceries. They were heading toward the motel

by the New Jersey State Police for passing a stopped school

bus.

He stated he was going to shoot it out with the New

Jersey State Trooper but became concerned when KEITH did not

appear to go along with the idea. They were going to stay at

the motel ;for approximately two weeks and then return to

Pennsylvania and get dynamite from some patriots in Pennsylvania.

If this plan was unsuccessful, they had planned to go to one

of the Western Statés and obtain dynamite under the guise of

future prospectors.

He stated that the chemicals that were

In the car at the time of his arrest were experimented with

by he and DRAGER in efforts to make a bomb.

These efforts were

not too successful and thusly they decided dynamite would be

a better method.

CARROLL advised the NRA is identical to the White

Action Movement formed by DRAGER in 1970 in Trenton, N.J.

He claims to have organized chapters all over the United

, States

and Canada and these groups are composed of disgruntled right

wing patriots who are not satisfied with the passive activities

of the KKK and the Minutemen Organization. He claimed to have

taken an oath and could not divulge who any of these other

members are.

He claimed this group is storing weapons and

explosives and no chapter knows where the other chapter's

weapons are.

CARROLL stated the NRA believes in doing anything

necessary to support themselves while they are endeavoring to

overtake the U.S. Government. The NRA believes in bank

robbery, armorea car heists,

and cashing stolen checks.

He said presently the NRA has no plans for political kidnappings.

He stated all their members are instructed to die for the

cause it necessary.

The NRA has devised a code system whereby

one member can contact another member without the Federal

authorities knowing this is being done. He stated they have

several training grounds throughout the East Coast and

Mid-west areas and their men are being trained in the use of

all kinds of weapons.

When specifically asked who other members of the

NRA were, CARROLL refused to identify any of these members

and it appeared as if possibly no members did, in fact,

exist.

CARROLL advised JAMES KEITH, who was arrested with

him in the stolen motor vehicle, was not a right wing Patriot

and could not be trusted.

'KEITH's services were requested

bY DRAGER inasmuch as KEITH is a close friend of JAMES

BRODERICK and was known to be active in criminal endeavors in.

the T'renton area.

He and DRAGER believed KEITH might be able

to financially help their cause.

CARROLI advised the NRA's philosophy was an incorpora-

tion of much of the thoughts of the KKK, Minutemen, and the

American Nazi Party.

He stated they were more revolutionary

and would actively and ardently endeavor to overthrow the U.s.

Government and replace it with the National Revolutionary

Army •

He expounded the philosophy that the NRA was anti-Jewish,

anti-Negro, and anti-Catholic.

The NRA is promoting the

deportation of all non-native born Americans and the return

of

the Jews and Negroes to their homelands.

He stated they

were definitely against the Federal Income

Tax, which is

what led them to decide to blow up the IRs building in

Washington, D.C. The NRA further advocates political assassinations

if necessary.

He stated that DRAGER had considered killing

a Judge GUBOW in Michigan but decided not to inasmuch as the

judge's death might hinder the appeal of Reverend BOB MILES

who has been sentenced to prison by Judge GUBOW for the

bombing of school buses

in Michigan.

CARROLI stated he and

DRAGER have cashed numerous stolen checks throughout the u.s.

to support themselves.

He indicated DRAGER was possibly

involved in an armed robbery in the Boston, Mass., area but

then decided he did not want to talk further about this matter.

DRAGER had obtained numerous handguns and rifles

while travelling throughout the u.s.

Most of these weapons

were purchased in the name of FRANK DRAGER, using identification

DRAGER had obtained in his own name in Florida.

CARROLL was asked about his knowledge of a tape

- recording sent to ORVILLE LIPPERT in Florida, where DRAGER

requests LIPPERT's assistance in returning his camper truck,

which LIPPERT purchased from him, to his aunt EDNA GRABER

in Trenton, N.J. In this tape! DRAGER identified himself to

LIPPERT so that EDNA GRASER can purchase back this vehicle for

DRAGER.

CARROLL stated LIPPERT purchased this vehicle from

DRAGER for $1.00. LIPPERT went to Springfield, Ill., and

obtained the

truck from the Springfield, Ill., police authorities.

At the end of this

tape, DRAGER makes reference to the fact

he killed "two pigs", in Atlanta and one in Miami Beach but

with zero publicity.

DRAGER then states "watch out for the

third pig." CARROLL advised the word pig referred to the

He stated they

obtained pigs which they killed and carried into a Jewish

synagogue in Atlanta and one in Miami Beach.

:.

KEITH stated he is a parole violator inasmuch as

he has been arrested. KEITH indicated he had no involvement

He stated that in his conversations with JAKE while

DRAGER's who works for the Sewer Department in Washington, D.C.

JAKE and DRAGER indicated they were going to blow up the IRS

Wwas Interviewed regarding his knowledge

involving his identification papers being found on a WILLIAM

ERIC CARROLI. when CARROLL was arrested on June 13, 1974,

by the New Jersey State Police at Columbus, N.J.

JENKINS initially advised he had no knowledge as to

how WILLIAM ERIC CARROLI could be in receipt of his driver's

license and Social Security Card. He stated he had lost

his wallet several months back and did not know its where-

abouts.

At that time,

it was pointed out to him that

CARROLL was a travelling companion of FRANK AUGUST DRAGER,

and that DRAGER had had his White Action Movement Headguarters

just two houses from the JENKINS' residence.

At that time,

JENKINS advised that he knew FRANK DRAGER and related the

following information:

He stated that early in the Spring of 1974 he

saw FRANK DRAGER in a camper truck with Pennsylvania tags

across the street from his residence. DRAGER had spotted him

coning home from school and pulled over to talk to him. DRAGER

had stated that he was wanted by the FBI and needed phoney

i an alone prete

identification. JENKINS advised he could not help him and

could not supply any information how he might obtain such.

JENKINS then advised that around the first of June,

1974, he again met DRAGER in the front of his residence and

DRAGER, at that time, was driving a green Ford Pinto believed

to have Florida license plates.

Again DRAGER requested false

identification, and JENKINS advised he could not supply him

with any. JENKINS then noticed his driver's license was about

to expire and asked DRAGER to take him down to the Department

of Motor Vehicles Trenton, N.J., where he could obtain a new

license. JENKINS then stated he must have accidently lost

his wallet in DRAGER's car when they were returning from the

Department of Motor Vehicles.

Again DRAGER indicated he was

wanted by the FBI and local police authorities. He stated

he was only passing through Trenton and was not staying in

the area.
