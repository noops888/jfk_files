INFORMANT

In early 5/59, CG 6065-s lattended a meeting between

CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, Illinois District Chairman, and PETTIS

PERRY, following

the last NaC meeting of the

CP. At this

meeting CG 6A65-S, a CP member and also a member of the left

wing faction in the NAACP, LIGHTFOOT, and PERRY agreed to

have liaison of left forces between Chicago, Los Angeles,

New York in the matter of nominations of delegates to the

national NAACP convention scheduled for 7/59 and to defeat

current leaderships in the various NAACP Branches!

On 4/29/59 THEODORE A. JONES visited the Chicago

Office andireiterated his anti-Communist policies with regard

to the governing of the Chicago Branch NAACP and was

confident that the Communists had been defeated. During

this interviewiJONES gave no indication of having knowledge

of the Coordinating Committee of the NAACP. He was quite

confident of his ability to keep Communists

out of the Chicago

Branch NAACP and indicated that while he would not run for re-

election in 12/59 he has selected a well known Negro business

executive and anti-Communist to succeed him and is confident

of this individual's election. He indicated, however,

a group of individuals whom he named were causine trouble

in the Branch and that he suspected them as being Communists.

"This office, while referring him to public sources,

advised him of the Bureau's position regarding dissemination

Caucus to Name Proposed Left Wing

Slate of Delegates to NAACP National Convention

INGORMANT

IcG 6066-sTadvised that on 5/7/59 the Co-ordinating

Committee of the NAACP held a meeting at which a slate of

delegates to the NAACP National Convention was nominated.

This meeting was attended by between 40 - 50 individuals,

including such prominent Communists as MILTON COHEN, member,

State Committee, CP, LESTER DAVIS, State Committee, CP, ROBERT

HYMER, member of CP

NAACP fraction, FRITZI ENGLESTEIN, a

prominent leader in the Ninth. Congressional District, CP,

LEO and BETTY GOLDMAN, and others.

There were also in attendance

current members of the

SwP and members of the ISI until it

merged with the socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation.

Informant advised that the individual leader of

this caucus was one TIM BLACK,

a Chicago school teacher and

an individual who can be described as a Negro nationalist.

However, informant advised that the leadership of ENGLESTEIN

and COHEN was instrumental in maneuvering in picking the

The slate itself includes two SWP members, one former

ISL members

two CP members and one leader of the Socialist

Party - Social Democratic Federation, out of a total proposed

Chicago Branch delegation of nine members.

INFoRmaNT The Co-Ordinating Committee strategy, according to

CG 6066-S, is that at the meeting at which the

Chicago Chapter

delegation is selected, they will pack the meeting with 75 to

80 of their group which is considered enough to swing the

vote in favor of their delegates.

The Co-ordinating Committee

is to concentrate on working for the nine named delegates as

delegates rather than alternates as it assumes the regular

NAACP organization will have its votes split further in

selecting both delegates and alternates.

Experience has shown that only 100 people attend

a NAACP meeting of this type. Therefore, the Co-ordinating

Committee feels that by having approximately 75 of its people

at the meeting it will sweep the election of delegates to

the National Convention and this in turn will open the door

for a sweep of the 12/59 elections for the leadership of the

Chicago Branch.

Observations and Proposals

Reliable informants have reported that the strength

of the CP in the leadership of the NAACP, Chicago Branch,

today is at its lowest ebb.

Within the past several weeks

the of fraction for work within the NAACP has been working

to organize and to broaden its

NAACP by defeating JONES as well as to increase its strength

in or at least change the leadership of the National Ifice

of the NAACP. If the Co-ordinating Committee objective of

election of its slate of delegates from the Chicago Branch

to the National Convention is successful, It will result in

a major accomplishment of CP organizational efforts in the

Negro field in that the NAACP in Chicago alone has approxi-

mately 20,000 members.

With these facts in mind and in considering that

THEODORE A. JONES is an intelligent and able leader with a

political machine of Congressman WILLIAM DAWSON to back him

up, it is felt that if he were put to notice of the existence

this caucus and slate he could defeat the CP in its

picture of the NAACP:

4/29/59 when JONES visited this office he was unaware of

any organized resistance to his leadership although he

recognized individual dissatisfaction among the members as

a result of their statements at Branch meetings.

CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE

Chicago Office by airtel 5-14-59 advised that through several

reliable informants, it was learned that a loosely knit group of individuals,

whose sole objective is to oust the Jones leadership calling themselves the

Coordinating Committee of the NAAC, has been formed. Included in this

group are members of the communist Party (CP), USA, members of the socialist

workers Party (SIP) (trotskyite organization); socialists; and other Negro

nationalist type individuals.

Ior the past several months this group has

held surreptitious meetings throughout Chicago organizing opposition to

Jones and also against the present national leadership of the NAACP.

INFORMANT

According to cg 6066-5, a meeting of this Coordinating Committee:

of the NAACP was held 5-7-59 at which a slate of nine delegates was

selected to attend the NAACP national convention scheduled to be held in

New York in July, 1959. This meeting was attended by 40 to 50 individuals

including prominent chicago communists, Milton Cohen and Lester Davis,

members Illinois State Committee CP, Robert Hymer, member of CP NAACP

two CP members and members of trotskyite and socialist groupings.

strategy of this co-ordinating Committee is to pack the meeting of the

Chicago branch of the NAACP scheduled for May 22, 1959, with 75 or 80 members

of their group and push for the election of their slate of nine delegates

Ipreviously selected. Since only approximately 100 people attend a Chicago

the election of their delegates to the national convention and

thereby also

lay the groundwork for ousting the Jones leadership of the Chicago branch

of the NAACP at the nect election in December, 1959.

If this concerted

plan of the CP and other dissident elements is successful,

it would be a

dangerous accomplisiment since the strength of the CP

in the Chicago branch

of the NAACP at the present time is at its lowest ebb.

Suggestions and Recommendations

Chicago feels that it played a definite part in the

defeat of the

"right led" mass organization.

attempt by the CP to infiltrate

Based on the results of the above and because of the

broad CP program of infiltration of mass organizations, it is

felt that this incident has demonstrated that the Bureau's

Counterintelligence Program can successfully be extended to

cover CP programs in "right led"

organizations.

The Bureau may desire to advise the field of the

additional counterintelligence possibilities offered in the

matter of the counteracting of Communist influence in mass

organizations.

It is felt that with careful planning and implementation,

the Bureau's Counterintelligence Program can be further extended

to obtain additional

effective results.

danger the Communist Party (CP) posed to his organization in this

Background

The Chicago Branch of the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) continues

to be headed by President THEODORE A. JONES, à Chicago

business executive, who is an outspoken anti-Communist.

During 1958, JONIS abolished NAACD Units at

Chicago which were heavily infiltrated by Conmunist Party

(CP) people and other Marxist elements.

Subject to Criminal Sanctions

Unaut'torized Disclosure

At the time of the unit dissolution by JONEs,

a Chicago NAACP faction in opposition to JONES was formed.

This faction, the NAACP "leit caucus"

, composed in part oi

CP, Socialist Workers Party (SP) and other Marxist groups,

unsuccessfully in December, 1958, to defeat

the JONES' slate in the annual Chicago NAACP election.

Again in May, 1959, the NAACP "left caucus" failed in its

attempt to elect a

slate, responsive to the "left caucus"

viewpoint, as delegates to the July, 1959 National NAACP

Convention at New York City.

1959, the

""left caucus"

appraised the

position. astutely

and began quietly to build an organization.

During the summer of 1959 while regular NAACP

activity at Chicago vas curtailed, the "left caucus"

set up a regular schedule of meetings, increased its

membership, elected a leadership and acquired funds.

The "left caucus" also recruited vigorously new NAACP

members at Chicago who were ideologically allied with the

"left caucus"

After organizing carefully from June to

October, 1959 and baiting JONES continually during that

period,

the "left caucus" in October, 1959, dealt the

current Chicago NAACP leadership, headed by THEODORE JONES,

two jarring blows:

1)

The entire "left caucus" slate

of delegates was elected to represent the Chicago NAACP

Branch at the 10/59 Illinois State Convention.

JONES,

though the leader of Illinois' most influential NAACO

Branch, was not even elected a delegate to the organization's

state convention; 2) The "left caucus" slate was elected

in toto in the annual NAACP nominating committee election.

This nominating committee is the key to NAACP elections

because it selects those names which will aypear on the

ballot at the annual December Chicago Branch NAACP election.

Among those elected to the nominating committee

of eight were MILTON COHEN and LESTER. DAVIS, members of the

Illinois State CP Committee, FRITZE INGLESTEIN, Illinois

It has been learned

that the "left caucus"

dominated nominating committee, while supposedly going

to nominate a slate acceptable

to both JONES and the

"left caucus", a "harmony slate", will at the last

possible instant on November 27,

1959, the day the ballot

is drawn up, nominate "left caucus" leader GERALD BULLOCK,

Whom JONES reportedly despises. BULLOCK will reportedly

be supported by former Chicago NAACP President WILLOUGHBY

ABNER, an enemy of JONES, Whom JONES defeated in the

Chicago NAACP Branch Presidential election of 1957. The

"left caucus" feels that the BULLOCK-ABNER coalition

will win easily not only because of its strength perse,

but primarily due to the fact that its existence will not

become known to JONES until the last minute on November 27,

1959 when itris too late for JONES to rally his forces.

It should be noted that in October, 1959,

Illinois CP Chairman CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT said that the

"inmediate task"of the Illinois CP is to recruit members

for the Chicago NAACP before November 11, 1959. LIGHTFOOT

said that new NAACP recruits who are signed up before

November 11, 1959' will be eligible to vote in the

December 11,

Chicago NAACP election and that thus

the CP can play a prominent behind-the-scenes role in the

December, 1959 Chicago NAACP election.

• On November 7, 1959, LESTER DAVIS, in addressing

South Side Chiçago CP leaders, said that "the NAACP

at Chicago can be altered by changing the rotten leadership....

We are within grasp of victory.....He are well nigh in a

position to exercise control of NAACP at Chicago."

Observations and Proposals

Based on the preceding information, it would

appear that the "left caucus" of NAAC? seems in an

excellent position to take over the NAACP at Chicago.

Unless President THEODORE JONES can somehow be energized

to marshal his followers ad campaign aggressively, it

i can a cauce and directing

In an attempt to frustrate the "left caucus"

the following tactic is suggested.

INFORMANT

NAACP PreSident THEODORE JONES and LOG 14-S, FIDENT

are both vitally interested in the civil rights question

and are both anti-Communist. IG 14-S, who holds a

leadership position in the

"left caucus", has asked for

guidance in what he calls "his current dilemma"

AS a MiSARMANT

"leit caucus" leader, CG 14-S wants to progress in the

caucus and thus increase his value to the Bureau. As a

well-educated,

intelligent Negro, he knows Communism

to be detrimental to the best interest of the Negro people

and fears

that the "left caucus" taking over NAACP at

Chicago will be prejudicial to the best interest of the

Negro.

INFORMANT

Currently CG 14-sJis meeting regularly with

NAACP President THEODORE JONES in an effort to work out

the so-called "harmony slate". It will be recalled that

the "leit caucus" is reportedly only using the "harmony

slate" as a subterfuge and plans at the last minute on

November 27, 1959, to double cross JONES and to spring

the BULLOCK-ABNER coalition.

In response to[co 14-s] request for guidance,

the Chicago Division proposes that while giving him

Even if JoNs is energized and goes all out,

he will' reportedly have great difficulty in defeating

the "left-caucus". If he were to activate and could not

defeat the "left caucus" completely, it is felt that

his political activities, if he can be influenced to

organize, can at least gain him sufficient support to

limit the Party influence in the NAACP to nirreducible

Informant advised that JONES' reaction upon

receiving this information was one of surprise and anger.

He promptly stated that although he did not intend to be a

candidate for re-election as President of the Chicago

Branch and had planned to take a cooperative and amenable

attitude toward the "harmony slate" being prepared by the

Nominating Committee, he now saw the need for direct

action in support of candidates of his own choosing in

the Branch election. He said he was considering two or three

individuals who might be strong candidates for President,

and that one of these would receive the unqualified and

active support of himself and his followers.

The following intormation concerning the recent

developments in this matter was received from CG 14-s

on 12/2/59:

INCORMANT

" Within a few days, after a meeting by JONES with

his supporters, he flatly rejected the "harmony slate"

which was offered by the Nominating Committee. Further,

at a meeting of the "left caucus" a decision was made that

the caucus would support a full slate of candidates which

included GERALD BULLOCK for President, LOLA BELLE HOLMES

for Secretary, and LESTER DAVIS and SAUL MENDELSON as

Executive Board members. DAVIS is a current member of the

Illinois State Committee of the Communist Party (CP) and

HOLMES is an Illinois CP member. MENDELSON is a former

member of the National Committee of the Independent

Socialist League, now defunct.

The JONES forces also prepared a slate which

included DEMPSEY TRAVIS, a well-known Negro realtor for

President, WILLIE THOMAS for First Vice President, ETHEL

DOSTAL for Secretary, and JAMES KEMP for Treasurer. TRAVIS

is a candidate personally selected by JONES, and the others

named are incumbents who are strong supporters of JONES.

KEMP 15 One Of JONES' first lieutenants and the source of

much of his

following among trade union members. JONES,

himself, is a candidate for the Executive Board on this

slate.

At a meeting of the Chicago Branch on 11/27/59,

the most important business was the election of a three

man Election Supervisory Committee to serve at the Branch

election on 12/11/59. The duties of this Committee are

to control procedures connected with the distribution of

the ballots and, in the past,

the Committee has also super-

vised the counting of the ballots.

This meeting was called

by JONES in a union hall near 74th Street and Cottage Grove

and his opponents accused him of choosing this hall because

he would be able to marshal

additional support from Chicago

NAACP members who are trade unionists and who normally

Insoman congregate there for recreational purposes.

According to

ICG 14-S,] there were over 200 members present at this meeting

and the composition of the membership present at first

indicated that the supporters of the

"left caucus" enjoyed

a slight numerical advantage.

With JONES presiding, the

meeting was temporarily delayed until additional members

from JONES' camp arrived.

Both sides offered three candidates for the

Election Supervisory Committee and each side named three

tellers to count the votes. It had been indicated that

there were about 220 members present but after 220 ballots

were counted there were still a large number of uncounted

serving as a teller for the caucus.

One of the JONES tellers

insisted that he had counted at least 300 members present

and the counting of the ballots was continued after a

ruling by JONES.

still a substantial number of uncounted ballots, MENDELSON

became extremely angry and challenged the legality of the

election. JONES ruled

against him.

MENDELSON then seized

both the counted and uncounted ballots. and threw them out

into the crowd, scattering the ballots on the floor.

After the confusion subsided, JONES, as Chairman,

ruled that MENDELSON had forfeited the election by his

action. He then announced that JAMES KEMP, THEODORE

CALLION, and AMY VICTOR, the candidates of the JONES forces,

had been elected to the Election Supervisory Committee

for the December Branch election of officers. JONES then

adjourned the meeting and left the hall.

These developments left the meeting in an uproar

and GERALD BULLOCK took the floor and drafted a telegram

of protest to ROY WILKINS, National NAACP leader, which was

signed by BULLOCK and at least ten others. The telegram

demanded supervision of the Chicago Branch election in

December

by impartial representatives of the NAACP National

Office.

In a meeting of tha"left caucus" held on 12/1/59,

the major activity was

the composition of a long letter

to the national leadership of the NAACP which included a

statement that a copy of the letter was being sent to the

local press. It was expected that this letter might influence

WILKINS to take action as requested by the "left caucus" in

supervising the forthcoming Branch election.

Some considera-

tion was also given to a proposal that an attempt be made

to obtain an injunction of some type against the JONES

forces.

No final decision was made on this proposal at

that time.

Observations and Conclusions

Although pertinent developments in this matter

have been set forth above, it is not possible to predict

the outcome of the 12/11/59 election at this time.

However,

CG 14-S has pointed out that if the Election Supervisory

Committee composed of JONES supporters is permitted to

function at the Branch election, the "left caucus" will be

faced with a very limited possibility of success. As an

indication that the Illinois Party leadership is concerned

about this development, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT recently instructed

both DAVIS and HOLMES to seriously consider remaining in

Chicago for the election in spite of the fact that they

are scheduled to accompany the Illinois delegation to the

CP National Convention on the same weekend.

From the developments to date, it is apparent

that JONES did take immediate and aggressive action in

mobilizing his forces for the 11/27/59 Branch meeting.

addition, he rejected the "harmony slate" supported by

"left caucus" and presented a slate of his own candidates

for Branch officers.

These were the immediate objectives

of the Chicago office in initiating this counterintelligence

activity as set forth in re airtel of 11/19/59.

The Bureau will be promptly advised of any

additional pertinent developments, including the final

outcome of the 12/11/59 Chicago Branch NAACP elections.

Chicago Branch of the National Association for Advancement of Colorea

at seizing control of the Chicago Branch at the annual election on

December I1, 1959. The planned strategy of the "left caucus"

was to have

its slate of officers nominated at the pre-election meeting scheduled

i for

November 27, 1959. Lour Informant, CG 14-S, was the chairman of the

Nominating Committeed which committee consisted of three communists, two

of whom were on the Illinois State Communist Party (CP) committee, as well

as a member of the Socialist Workers Party and a former member of the

national committee of the Independent Socialist League. According to SC :

CG 14-S, it looked as though the Nominating Committee would nominate a

The Chicago Office, by airtel dated December 3, 1959, furnished

information pointing out that our counterintelligence efforts in trying to

prevent the communists from seizing control of this 20,000-member Chicago

Branch of the NAACP has been Initially successful. However, the final test

will come on December. 11, 1959, when the actual election of

officers will

LCG 14-S, following instructions and without revealing his intorm-

ant status, discreetly advised Jones on November 23, 1959, of the secret

plans of the "left caucus" Nominating Committee to double cross Jones and

select a slate of

candidates not acceptable to Jones (after promising to

select a

"harmony slate"

of candidates)which would have included a commun

nist as secretary and another communist as executive board member. The

Jones forces prepared an opposing slate of noncommunist officer candidates.

At the Chicago Branch meeting on November 27, 1959, the most important busi

ness was to elect a three-man Election Supervisory Committee to serve at

the Branch election on December 11, 1959.

This committee would control pro-

cedures connected with the distribution of ballots and supervise the count-

ing of the baliots.

The November 27, 1959, meeting was called by Jones in

a union hall near 74th Street and Cottage Grove in Chicago and his oppo-

nents accused him of choosing this hail because he would be able to marshal

additional support from Chicago NAACP members who are trade unionists and

who normally congregate there for recreational purposes.

the supporters of the "left caucus" enjoyed a slight numerical advantage.

Jones, who was presiding, delayed the meeting until additional Jones sup-

porters arrived. Both sides then offered three candidates for the Election

Supervisory Committee: It had been indicated that there were about 220

members present at the meeting.

When the vote count passed 265 and there

was still a substantial number of uncounted ballots, Saul Mendelson, a lead-

ing member of the "left caucus" who was serving as a teller for the caucus,

became extremely angry and challenged the legality of the election. Jones

ruled against him and Mendelson then seized both the counted and uncounted

ballots and threw them out into the crowd, scattering the ballots on the

f100r.

After the confusion subsided, Jones, as chairman, ruled that

Mendelson had forfeited the election by his

action and then announced that

the candidates representing the Jones forces had been elected to the Electic

Supervisory Committee.

Jones then adjourned the meeting and left the hall.

These developments left the meeting in an uproar and Gerald Bullock, who 1s

to be the

• "left caucus"

candidate for president of the Chicago Branch, took

the floor and drafted a telegram of protest to Roy Wilkins, national NAACP

leader, which was signed by Bullock and at least 10 others.

The telegram

demanded supervision of the Chicago Branch election on December 11, 1959, by

Impartial representatives of the NAACP national office.

[cG 14-sTnas advised that while it is impossible to predict the

outcome of the December 11, 1959, election, if the Election Supervisory

Committee composed of

CG 200-32864

to JONES of the "left Caucus" plan to double cross

him, JONES emerged from his lethargy and went into

action.

JONES used the technique "first things first"

and from 11/24/59, to 11/27/59, he concentrated on

defeating the "Left Caucus" attempt to gain control of

the Election Supervisory Committee. JONES' first goal

was achieved during the turbulent

meeting of 11/27/59,

(Chicago airtel of 12/3/59).

From

1 11/28/59, to 12/11/59, JONES, with apparently

only his most intimate lieutenants as confidants, planned

the following strategy which was put into practice on

12/11/59, and resulted in the routing of the "left Caucus";

JONES reportedly in early December, 1959,

although a strong Republican, entered into an alliance

with the strong Chicago South Side Democratic Organization

for the purpose of defeating the "Left Caucus".

As the

election process began at approximately 8:30 p.m. on

12/11/59,

"the South Side Democratic Organization

tight control of the balloting process.

held

Democratic

ward committeemen, piecinct captains and their followers

were located strategically at each phase of the election

process.

The Democratic Organization 'got out'' the vote

and despite the fact that a torrential rain storm occurred

on the evening of 12/11/59, the Democratic Organization

"brought» in" enough people to insure JONES' victory

by a. wide margin.

JONES also struck a paralyzing psychological

blow at the "Left Caucus".

Any "Left Caucus" thought

of disrupting the meeting was removed quickly because

on approaching the polling place the first sight visible

through the intense rain was the flashing red lights

of police vehicles. Inside eight uniformed policemen

directed by a police sergeant circulated continuallyand

by their presence thwarted any latent disruptionist

tendencies of the "Left Caucus". The election was run

in an efficient businesslike manner and was directed

by an NAACP Official appointed by the NAACP leadership.

At the completion of the balloting, the "left Caucus"

made no complaint of any kind regarding irregularities.

Observations and Conclusions

Without the use of the counterintelligence tactic

sanction in Bureau teletype of 11/23/59, it is felt

that the "Left Caucus" would possibly have taken over

NAACP at Chicago or certainly gained a poweriul voice

in Chicago NAACP affairs by successfully gaining a

INSORmANT number of elective positions.

As late as 11:00 a.m.

on 12/11/59, [CG 14-STadvised the Chicago Division

that

he, from his close vantage point, deemed the election's

results "a toss up". It is also

felt by the Chicago

Division that the use of any lesser counterintelligence INFORMANT

technique would have failed badly. CG 14-Shas advised

that undoubtedly the "leak" of the impending "Left Caucus"

double cross so jolted JONES that JONES dropped everything

and set out to defeat the

• "Left Caucus".

The result

of using the counterintelligence tactic in point seens to

be that for the year 1960, NAACP at Chicago will have

outspoken anti-Communist leadership to the consternation

oj Illinois CP Chairman CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT who designated

NAACP at Chicago as the point of CP concentration for

mass organizational work.

It is noted that LIGHTFOOT

had assigned

several Illinois CP members, including two

Illinois CP District Committeemen to the allout task

of taking over NAACP at Chicago by means of a "Left

Caucus" victory in the 12/11/59, NAACP Election at Chicago.

As far as the informant knows, HALL is not

personally acquainted with LUTHER KING, and was not fully aware of

KING's pro-Communist leanings until recently,.

when LEVISON,

through LEM HARRIS, sent HALI a report on KING, and LEVISON's

close association with KING.

Although not impossible, it is in-

consistent that HALL in New York would write a speech for KING,

[HALL, although he can deliver a fair speech, does not

write well.

He is ungrammatical and knows little if anything

about proper sentence structure. NY I-ll has heard in the

past that HALL, in preparing to give a speech has submitted the

haeas to people such as JAMES ALLEN, MICHAEL DAVIDOW and ARNOLD

Southern Freedom Struggle, because they are all one and the same.

On October 27, 1961, Special Agents of the FBI

houses an office of the SCLC.

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE

EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC.

The Southern Patriot, a monthly publication, shows

that it is published by the Southern Conference Educational

The Southern Patriot was cited as an "organ" of the

•Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHv) by the Committee

on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, on the SCHW,

June 12, 1947.

::'

The SCHi was cited as a communist front by the

Committee on Un-American Activities, House Report 592,

June 16, 1947.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW changed

the name of that organization to the SCEE,

and listed its

purpose as being to improve the educational ana cultural

standards of the Southern people in accordance with the

nignest American democratic institutions, traditions, and

Ideals. The amendment was dated April 26, 1946..

A source, who is familiar with some phases of

communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised on

May 15, 1961, that during the time the SCHw was in existence,

Communist Party (CP) members were members of and worked

actively in the SCHW. However, since the formation of the

SCEF, rank and file CP membershave not been encouraged to

WOrK

in the SCEF.

The source stated that the SCEF is a

progressive, liberal organization, which he considers

• a. CP

front organization because it has gone along with the CP

on certain issues, particularly on the racial question, and

through the years,

certain CP members in the New Orleans

area have been assigned to work in the organization to further.

CP principles.

On May 15, 1961, the source advised that in the past

he has considered JAMES DOMBROWSKI, the Executive Director

of the SCEF, tobe a Communist, if not an actual CP member,

because he

followed communist principles.

incident nationally and internationally through the CAMD and thus

attract individuals to the Sip's aims

and principles by playing a

leading role in the integration struggle.

The headquarters of CAMD is located in Suite 1117, 141

HIGHLANDER FOLK SCHOOL

An Atlanta Journal newspaper article appeared December 15,

1957, entitled "Highlander Director Says School Not Communist, But

In Same Field". The article reported the Highlander Folk School was

established in September, 1932, by MYLES HORTON, Director, and

DONALD L. LEST, a Georgian with a long record of affiliations with

Communist front groups.

HORTON denied that he or the school had

ever had any connection with the Communists.

The article stated that Highlander hit the headlines two

months ago when the Georgia Commission on Education publishea a

four-page newspaper-size report charging that the institution is a

"Communist Training School.

The commission, set up by the Georgia

Legislature to help preserve segregation, charged that Highlander's

race-mixing plans are part of a communist scheme to create strife.

As proof, the commission reported that a number of persons who had

been connected with Highlander also had been connected with

organizations labeled as communist fronts by the HUA.

was organized in August, 1950, at Los Angeles, California, to

stimulate new and utilize all efforts of interested individuals and

organizations in a national campaign to promote public education

leading to political action to abolish the House Committee on Un-

American Activities (HCUA). The National Committee to Abolish

the Un-American Activities Committee will not duplicate the work

and will promote new efforts in those Congressional Districts where

education and political action for abolition have not been initiated.

FRANK WILKINSON is the Field Representative of the

National Committee to Abolish the Un-American Activities Committee.

According to the source, WILKINSON periodically confers with

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC.

The Southern Patriot, a monthly publication, shows that

1t 1s published by the Southern Conference Educational Fund, Inc.

(SCEF) •

The Southern Patriot was cited as an "organ" of the

Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW) by the Committee on

Un-American Activities, House Report 592, on the SCHW, June 12, 1947.

The SCHW was cited as a communist front by the Committee

on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 16, 1947.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW changed the name

of that organization to the SCEF, and listed its purpose as being

to improve the educational and cultural standards of the Southern

people in accordance with the highest American democratic institu-

tions, traditions, and ideals. The amendment was dated April 26,

1946.

A source,

who is familiar with some phases of Communist

Party (CP) activity in the New Orleans area, advised on May 22, 1959,

that during the time the SCHil was in existence, CP members were

members of and worked actively in the ScHW.

However, since the

formation of the SCEF, rank and file CP members have not been

encouraged to work in the SCEF.

The source stated that the SCEF is

a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a CP front

organization because it has gone along with the CP on certain

work in

issues, particularly on the racial question, and through the years,

certain CP members in the New Orleans area have been assigned to

work in the organization to further CP principles.

On May 22, 1959, the source advised that in the past he

has considered JAMES DOMBROWSKI, the Executive Director of the SCEF,

to be a Communist, if not an actual Communist Party member, because

he followed communist principles.

The source also advised on May 22, 1959, that many people

who are officials and members of the SCEF, while liberal in their

views, are by no means communists.

WOMEN'S PEACE AND UNITY CLUB, formerly

known as the Chicago Women for Peace

The aims and purposes of the Chicago Women for Peace (CWP),

as set forth in its self-identified publication, "Chicago Acts

for

Peace" (CAP), May, 1951, issue, describes this organization as a

"service center for women working for peace." This publication

described the Chicago Women for Peace as being affiliated with

the American Women for Peace and as co-operating with the American

Peace Crusade.

The January, 1954, issue of "CAP" announced the dissolution

of the American Women for Peace and the affiliation of the Chicago

Women for Peace with the American Peace Crusade Council in Chicago.

A source advised in November, 1956, that the CWP remained

affillated with the American Peace Crusade, Chicago, until that

organization dissolved in September, 1955.

The CWP continued with

no national affiliation until September, 1956, when a "re-organization

ana name change took place"

Peace and Unity Club"

the reason given for this "re-

meantation wed that lied bordet tie deery o the

organization, was that the CWP had been formed

to end the Korean War

and since that war was over and there was a "measure of peace in the

world"

, women's interests were more centered on such issues as civil

rights,

desegregated and better schools, juvenile delinguency, equal

opportunities for women,

advised that the only actual "re organization" of the CVP was the

change of its name to "Women's Peace and Unity Club".

Another source advised in October, 1956, that the CP,

Illinois-Indiana District, had ordered the dissolution of the CWP

because it no longer served the purpose of the Party, since it was

a "Left-wing"

peace group. Though the CP refused to dissolve and

chose to continue in the form of the "Women's Peace and Unity Club,"

It continues to be a "Communist front organization" whose policies

and activities are directed by DOROTHY HAYES, a known CP member.

The previous source advised on May 7, 1959, that the

WPUC continues

to operate in the Chicago area as a peace organization

under the same leadership and with the same objectives.

The American Women for Peace and the American Peace

crusade have all been designated by the Attorney General of the

United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

group, under the leadership o1 national committee member

Sam Ballan, Inown in the SWP as Sam Marcy, split from the

SWP.

The source stated that this minority. group referred

to as the Marcyites, alter many years of program and policy

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and inter-

pretation of political events, split from the SWP on the

grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by departing

from the Marxist precepts of Leon Trotsky and retreating

from the fight for the world socialist revolution. The

final issue which ultimately forced the split was the minority's

opposition to the SWP regroupment policy which involved

cooperation with the Communist Party (CP) periphery -

individuals characterized by the minority as petty-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,

advocates the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union

and has as its goal

the building of a revolutionary party

with a complete proletarian orientation for the purpose

of overthrowing capitalism in the United States and throughout

the world.

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this

minority group had chosen the name Workers World Party with

headquarters located

furnished information concerning the influence of levison and

O'Dell on King and "King's group" should be recontacted, where

appropriate, to pin down whether such influence is exerted on

King, the SCLC or the individuals working with King on the

that

he had no information concerning

Communist Infiltration

into SCLC.

It is recommended that a Cominfil investigation be

It is not contemplated there would be any need for

investigation by Savannah at the Dorchester Center, feIntost

County, Georgia. The only CP member known to be active

there was O'DolL and that was for a short pariod of time

(in early 1962.

There is no indication that any investigation would

lbe made in this matter in the Mobile Division.

New Orleans, if investigation authorized by the

Bureau, should determine whether a SCLC branch has been

established in your division.

If so, whether CAULFIELD,

HUDSON or other CP members formed or control it or bave

any great influence on its activities.

It is obvious thatall'CP infiltration or influence

known at this time is either in New York City or emanates

from there.

The only CP member who is known to be an officer

O£ SCLC is HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. He divides his time between

his position of head of SCLC branch office in New York City

and his duties at Atlanta Headquarters.

All of his known

CP contacts are in New York City with the exception of

SARGEANT CAULFIELD in Louisiana.

felt to bo a thorough inquiry into these charges and were unabla

to discover any present connections with the Commusiat pasty on

The situation in our country is such, however, that any ailusion

to indicate that SCL C and the Southern Freedom Movamen! are

Communist inspired. In these critical times me cannot alford to

risk any such impreasions. We, therefore, have dacicad in our

Administrative Committes, that we shoulá request you to santa

your tomporary resignation permanent.

We certainly appreciate the yeara of undelfiah service waich you

have put lato our New York Office, and regret the necessity of

your departure, Certainly, youre is a significant sacrifice com-

monaurate with the suiterings la jail and through loss of jobs

under raciet intimidation. We all pray for the day when our
