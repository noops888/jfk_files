On 10/28/68, Ny 4047-s* advised that LEE (LNU) nad

been in contact with SUE FRANK In New York City on that date.

FRANK indicated a willingness to speak before a group if LEE

would advise her in advance of the date and time for the meeting

so she could then determine if she could attend.

LEE said there might be a meeting in February, 1969,

and FRANK said she might be free to attend, but could not

decide until she hears of a definite date.

FRANK indicated

no concern about the format of the proposed meeting, or

whether it would be open to the public, but only wanted to

know if and when there would be one.
