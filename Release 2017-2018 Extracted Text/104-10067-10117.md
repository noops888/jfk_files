THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELIGENC

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

OLC 79-0113/n

19 March 1979

Office of Legislative Counsel

Mr. G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel and Director

Select Cormittee on Assassinations

House of Representatives

Washington, D.C.

20515

Dear Bob:

Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains

under cover, retired abroad.

we are obliged to honor. that cover,

which he has not moved to have modified. To expose his true

status as a former CIA employée could have repercussions in his

present situation that we must accept as significant.

When he

was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary

to remove his cover; in the event he decided to go overt in this

matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status.

It remains

classified. We therefore reguest that the example set in the

Hart testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy

Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft.

Following are detailed comments:

NOSENKO

Testimony of Nosenko

Circled Page 3, lines 14 ard 17, depending on how one counts.

KGB agents should read KGB officers....

Circled Page 4, lines 3 through 20. Suggest the following

rewrite:

there were two factors, however, that limited the value

of the information supplied to the Cormittee by these

ex-KGB officers: 1) neither had been assigned to the

same KGB Directorate as Nosenko, and 2) one of .them had

information about the KGB that was outdated.

•Circlad Page 6. Nosenko's actual testimony, last response. Suggest

changing word "defectionist" to "defector.

: Page 6, line 6. Delete "woman in Utah" and insert "individual."

Page 6, lines 20 and 21. Delete "and even was a co-op fron CIA."

and insert "U.S. Government

property outside the Washington area."

Third page of statement made by Nosenko to HSCA 8/1/78, last

paragraph.

Suggest placing month "October" in brackets after "November" to

reflect correct date (we realize Mr. Nosenko gave this date, but it is

incorrect).

Solie Testimony

Page 56, line 17. Statement should read, "The transcript will

reflect I asked him to prepare it in his own words on a previous day,

a day or two before."

Page 58, line 9. "Assuming! not "assing.":

Page 59, Line 23. Delete "Uh-uh" and substitute "yes."

Page 66, line 20. Delete corma and "by down there" and substitute

"and by SR."

Page 69, line 11.

Even though Mr. Klein undoubtedly used the word

"agents", the word "officers" should be there.

Murphy Testimony

Pages numbered 4 and 5, Lines 24-25 and line 5, respectively.

Solie not Soley.

Change "our foreign liaison agents" to read
