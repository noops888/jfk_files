NOTE FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

JFK-Person Claiming to be

Assisting FBI Task

Force

1. PAI called today to advise me of a call PAI received

for information on what CIA is doing to declassify JFK

assassination records.

The caller said his name was Kal

Koff, phone: 408-897-7554 (California). He claimed that he

was assisting the FBI's JFK Task Force and this was the

reason that he wanted information about CIA's efforts.

I gave the information to Grant Harmon, FBI, who

said he had never heard of the person, but would call him to

learn more.
