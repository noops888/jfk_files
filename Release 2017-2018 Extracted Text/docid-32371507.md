MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: RODRIGUEZ, Emilio A.

#214442

1. Ellin Glenn, Executive Secretary, HMAB, contacted the writer

to determine whether or not the Intelligence Medal of Merit awarded

the Subject could be released to his immediate family now that the

Subject is deceased.

As will be noted from the file, Rodriguez has been involved

in covert activities with the Agency under one cover or another Ior

a number of years. The Central Cover Staff (Tom Strange) was asked

to provide the Office of Security with a "reading" of whether or not

there was an objection to presenting this award as requested.

3. On 29 November, Hi Steele, Benefits and Services Division,

Office of Personnel, brought for the attention of FAB a BEC claim

being processed in behalf of the Subject's widow, a claim which

alleges that the rigors and tension of the activities carried on by

Rodriguez probably caused his fatal heart attack. Steele stated he

had been in discussion with members of the family, and the Subject's

sons, who are aware of the award, had asked him if it might now be

released.

The Central Cover Staff reported that a contact with the

WH Division and a thorough discussion of the case had led to a de-

cision that the award should not be released to the Subject's family

at this time -- primarily as a safety measure due to the very sensi-

tive activities in which Rodriguez had recently been involved. All

parties are aware of the security consciousness of Rodriguez's family

but feel that the added factor of safety in this case is perhaps the

better judgement.

5. The writer has informed Ellin Glenn, ES/HMAB, and Hi Steele

of the decision and has suggested a recheck of this case in one year.
