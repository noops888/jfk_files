Service.

SANCHEZ dictated the following information to

steno, JANE A. KOEHLER:

"I flew via Central America back to the Dominican

Republic by

KIM plane to Curacao, Pan American

to Haiti, and Pan American to Cludad Trujillo.

Curacao I met the Dominican Consul, Mr. POLANCO, änd the

Vice Consul, Mr. VICIOSO. This occurred in August, 1959.

Iwo of three days later, Mr. VICIOSO took off with all

the confidential Consulate documents.

Consul POLANCO

gave me a large envelope to take to the Foreign Relations

Department.

These documents were classified 'Confidential!,

'Secret',

Top Secret'; eta.

was about a week after

I returned to the Dominican Republic that I heard that Mr.

VIcIoso nad deserted and took off with the

documents.

In Curacao, I met Mr. CANCIO BELLO, former BALISIA nava

officer who was assigned to the Inter-American Defense

Junta®

On my return,

BELLO and myself occupied adjacent

seats

In the plans and he told me he was going to wait

for a visa to go to the United States from the Dominican

Republic. He was coming from Guatemala.

I believe he

Is in Miami now.

When I arrived in the Dominican Republic

I went to see ABBES, the Chief of the SIM. When I

entered his office, there was a lot of activity there.

as to what he was doing.

Cuba. Trinidad 1s ours

already. Morgan and Menoyo

are with us.'

Morgan is a former American paratrooper who

went to cula to fight with Castro forces against Batista.

His first name is Willlam.

He was a Major in the Cuban

rebel army.

"Menoyo is a Spaniard. I've heard he is a

Communist from way back.

He was a Major on the Escambray

Front. Now he is a Major in the Cuban red army.

ABBES said I was lucky to escape.

ABBES said

'now I need

you right away for another 100.

Morgan 1s calling for

Instructors to help train farmers against Castro. We have

a @ 46 plane leaving tonight.

Do you want to go?'. Then

I told him 'sir I don't trust Morgan or Menoyo.

I would

rather wait a few days.! That plane was captured In

Cuba that same night and two or three of the men were

killed and

the rest are imprisoned in Cuba.

This occurred

in August, 1959. The same night I was at ABBES office

I heard Morgan calling JOHNNY on a short wave raito.

MORGAN asked him for heavy equipment.

ABBES thought that

MORGAN was with him against CASTRO,

but MORGAN was just

putting on an act and CASTRO knew all the details of the

plot to invade Cuba.

MORGAN received close to $75,000

ABBES and from

AUGUSTOXFERNANDO, Dominican Consul

in Miami. They met MORGAN at a Miami Beach hotel.

FLA

D. ^

This occurred around May of June, 1959 and the money

was paid to him then.

"At this time in May of 1959, JOHNNY went to

Miami to make contact with MORGAN.

He was accompanied by MANUEL

OLIVARI MALLEN as a bodyguard, and they had a good time in

calypse night club very close to downtown Miami. The

person who arranged MORGAN's meeting was Father VELAZCO,

a Spanish priest.

Father VELAZCO 1s a paid agent of SIM,

not an informer.

Father VELAZCO had been in cuba to

arrange this meeting

When I returned from Mexico, I gave

a small 25 pistol with gold grios to JOHNNY as a gift.

I

had some other gifts for POLICARPU SOLER,

POLICARPO was

known in the Dominican

Republic as ! Joaquin Rodriguez' and 'General Rodriguez'

and he had a Cuban passport under that name.

A few

nonths prior to this (about May), FOLICARPO went to Miami witl

eneral JOST PEDRAZA and they met ROLANDO MASFERRER, FOrme

Cuban Senator and the head of a private army called

"'Tigers' a bunch of killers. They went in a Dominican

warship disguised as Dominican naval officers. It was

either a trigate or a destroyer.

On the return trip,

FERIA, also known as 'El Indior'

with some other men dressed

in Dominican naval uniforms was brought to the Dominican

Republic.

I told JOHNNY I was going to see SOLER and

he told me not to go there often to see SOLER.

Right

away I knew something was cooking against SOLER. This

was around August 14 or 15, 1959. I asked for permission

to go there and JOHNNY told me to go and give ScuuR the

gifts and take off.

Then I went to my home, got iny car,

and went to see SOLER.

When I arrived at his home I saw a

new car there, which belonged to SOLER. It was a black

Cadillac, late model.

It did not have

any license plates.

It confirmed my suspicions that SOLER was out of favor

because he had

Palace license plates for four years.

When I entered SOLER's house, he came to me with a submachine

gun in his hand looking very

nervous. He asked me 11 I

was with him or against him.

I gave him the right answer

and said

'I am with Trujillo'

Then we went to his

room and he told me that he had a fight with JOINVY

because he knew that MORGAN was against TRUJILLO and not with

TRUJILLO.

He said that JOHNNY was a fool and a queer and that he

told JOHNNY that he, JOHNNY, was a homosexual. SOLER'S

wife was very nervous and then she told me 'Sanchez,

you have to stick with us because if something happens to

my husband, the same thing will happen to you.!

I gave

SOLER the present I had, some pistol holstens and cartridge

belts, and right away I went to see JACOBOR iRUJILLO, half

brother of El Benefactor.

asked JACOBy what was going

on with SOLER while I was in

• Mexico. JACOBO told me
