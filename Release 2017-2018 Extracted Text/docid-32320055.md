Title:

PROCUREMENT OF ASSASSINATION RECORD REVIEW

AND CLASSIFICATION CONSULTATION SERVICES

Synopsis:

It is requested that the services of Margaret Ann Cook

be extended through Fiscal Year 1998.

Details: The Historical and Executive Review Unit (HERU) is

responsible for transferring FBI records covered by the

"President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act

of 1992" (the Act) to the National Archives and Records

Administation (NARA) .

To date over 666,000 pages have been

transferred to NARA and at least 180,000 pages remain to be

transferred.

The Act provides that certain information in records

sent to NARA can be postponed (withheld). One basis for

postponement is the demonstrated need to continue to classify

However, the Task Force is attempting to

minimize the amount of postponed information in part by

declassifying information whenever it is possible to do so.

JFK records contain a great deal of classified information,

relating chiefly to Russian, Cuban and Communist Party USA

(CPUSA) matters.

Much declassification has been accomplished by

Document Classification Unit

personnel assigned to the Task

Force and additional declassification has been achieved through a

review conducted by personnel from the National Security Division

62A #P-1029205-364

â€¢ Mrs. Cook was the Supervisor of the DCU analysts

assigned to the Task Force from November 1993 until her

retirement in March 1995 and has served as a classification

consultant to the JFK Task Force since that time. Her experience

and vast knowledge the JFK Act and how it applies to FBI records

cannot be duplicated.

Re: 62A-HQ-1029205, 09/18/1997

Aot of 1992 (44 USC 2107 Hote).

The JEK Records Collection Act not only calls the

release of all records relating to the Assassination of President

Kennedy and the various "conspiracy" theories; it also

established an independent Presidential Review Board to oversee

the identification and release of those records.

Assassination Records Review Board (the Board)

was appointed by

President Clinton, confirmed by the United States Senate and

sworn in on April 11, 1994.

The Board reviews federal agencies'

documents for release and had until October 1, 1997 to fulfIL

its obligation.

Recently President Clinton signed a law

authorizing a

one-year extension for the Board.

The Board has

until October 1, 1998 to complete the review of all records

relating to the JFK Assassination and will not be given another

extension.

Due to the time constraints placed on the JFK Task

Force and Mrs. Cook's unequivicable institutional knowledge, it

is imperative that Mrs. Cook's contract be extended one

additional year.

It is requested that Mrs. Cook's consultation

services be contracted for

one additional year (10/1/97-9/30/98)

at a cost not to exceed $35,000 for the tiscal year.
