Thereafter, he stated that he would

repeat the details so that notes could be taken relative to the

matter. Mr. KREITSEK spoke for a period in excess of two hours,

during which time he advised that he was forced to pay approximately

$28,000.00 to GRANELLO and GEORGE LEVINE under the threat of bodily

harm to

subject in a court of law:
