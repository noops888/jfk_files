MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: SSCI Request for Review of Cuban Product

1 February 1977

1. On 28 January 1977, Tom Moore of the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence staff came to NSA to review

materials requested by SSCI letter R#6009 dated' 30 December

1976.

The material provided by G Group consisted of 485

reports on the Cuban agent problem for the period 1961-1965.

Mr. Moore had previously seen a single message

involving an agent named "Serafin" which the FBI had in

their files and had referred the Committee to NSA under the

Third Agency rule.

3.

Mr. Moore was extremely interested in the material

on

"Serafin."

He volunteered that there was a Cuban agent

by the name of

"Serafin" who had defected to the U.S. sometime

in 1965/66. That same person was killed in October 1976 by

persons unknown.

There was some significant product in

May/June 1963 where "Serafin" was to travel to Mexico - under

extreme care. Mr. Moore

indicated that he would probably

like to review any Cuban

material for the same"

44USC2107(5)(g)(2)(D

period.

b(ili)

4. Mr. Moore made

a few notes of specific events but

did not request any copies of messages or reports for use

by the Committee.

5. Mr. Moore told me today that he and Mr. Ed Greissing

(from the SSCI research staff) would be out later this week

for an additional review of the material.

8.0

6. This completes action on R/S 0008.

KEVINDUM FEE THR RECORD

4 January 1977

scapect: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) Inquiry

into the Assassinations of Kennedy and King

1 ..

On 30 December, the undersigned met with Howard

Licbengood,

Deputy Staff Director of the SSCI staff and Tom

Moore,

staff member.

The meeting was to permit the Committee

to read an

NSA end-product report on Cuba in response to the

Committee's letter #5900 dated 20 December 1976. The Committee

staff members exhibited keen interest in the product and the

two Cuban national names contained therein.

The Committee

staff also indicated that they intended to broaden the scope

of their inquiry and would forward to NSA another letter

(which has been received and is inclosed) requesting access

to all Cuban reports stored in the repository for the period

1961-1965.

2. After the meeting, the undersigned contacted LTC Don

Bennett of Mr. Latimer's office to inform him of the first

letter since it had been sent directly to NSA. LTC Bennett

indicated that another Dod component had been asked for similar

information. As a result, LIC Bennett stated Mr. Latimer was

revising his earlier containing policy on providing to the

SSCI

information on the assassinations and now had decided on

a policy of full cooperation.

At Mr. Latimer's direction,

LTC Bennett will draft a letter to Staff Director Bill Miller

suggesting a meeting between the SSCI staff and Mr. Latimer's

staff; the meeting will focus on projected Dod responses to

the Committee's inquiry. NSA will be invited to attend these

meetings.
