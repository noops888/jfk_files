to appoint him as a colonel in the Cuban Army of Liberation and had also

requested that he be provided with credentials from the Cuban government -

in exile. JUBEL is quoted as saying that the plan agreed upon by his "friends"

his "friends" will supply. A force of 10,000 men will be utilized; 5, 000 for

an attack on Habana, 2,000 as reserves, and 3, 000 as standby reserves.

These forces will be supported by jet aircraft purchased in Europe. Funds

jet aircraft.
