Date of transcription

10/31/78

GEORGE BEN EDMONDSON was contacted at his home,

Route 2,

Box 179, Walla Walla, Washington (509-525-2126),

where he is living under the assumed name of ALEX P.

BORMANN and employed by the Boise Cascade Company.

EDMONDSON was advised of the Bureau policy requiring

its own Waiver for the release of information and that such a

Waiver would authorize the Bureau to release all information

concerning him, even that which had previously been considered

confidential.

EDMONDSON acknowledged that he understood the

Bureau policy and specifically stated that it was his under-

standing that his 1959 confidential FBI file would be released

to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, if so requested.

EDMONDSON also expressed concern that the House Select

Committee on Assassinations would not be able to maintain proper

control of the information in his file, pointing out that

investigators for the Committee, to whom he has spoken, appear

to be a little young and lacking in

experience.

EDMONDSON

stated, however, that he would conti-ue cooperate with the

Committee, and executed the following Waiver authorizing

release of information:

"AUTHORITY TO RELEASE INFORMATION

"I hereby authorize any Special Agent or other

authorized representative of the Federal Bureau of Investi-

release, to furnish to the House Select

Committee on Assassinations all information in its possession

concerning me, including those records pertaining to my confi-

dential relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

I realize that by authorizing this release I will disclose to

the House Select Committee on Assassinations any confidential

relationship I may have had with the FBI.
