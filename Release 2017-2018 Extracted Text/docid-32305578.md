not believe that GRECO will marry ROSELLI; that GRECO is aware

of ROSELLI's background and that she thinks GRECO has more

DIANE PALEY, former Bookkeeper for Automatic Shine

She recalls

when she first went to work for this company in January, 1965,

that on one occasion ROSELLI came to the office with EMANUEL

ROTHMAN, who was one of the directors of the company. She said

that this is the only time she has seen ROSELLI. She saia

that it is her opinion, through her work at this company, for cal

about three months, that ROSELLI does not have, or did not have-

an interest in the

company.

She said that ALBERT BRODKIN, who

was the president, was an

extremely poor businessman and some-

thing of a

man; that he never paid any bills unless

forced to and was working all of the time on borrowed money;

that he was a man of little principle who would lie whenever

it suited his interests and that he did not seem to have

sufficient ability to successfully manage a business.

Examination of the bank account, "EMANUEL ROTHMAN,

; at the Union Bank, Los

been used extensively in the past to handle financial trans-

actions of Roseull, reflects that on 7/2/65 a check for $2,500

was paid to MAURICE FRIEDMAN..

A notation on the face of the

check set out' Repayment of one half of principal balance of

5/3/65 l0an."

The check was deposited to some account at the

Fidelity Bank, Mar Vista, California. Contact with this

bank failed to reflect that FRIEDMAN

has an account at this

bank.

Efforts are being made to trace the account to which

the check was deposited.
