On the morning of l December 1963, PARMUTH assisted RESCIGNO

in installing audio microphones under the flooring of an LCHARVEST occupied

apartment. (See HMMA-22608, 11 Dec 63, para 5.d.) Lines leading from the

audio installation to the LP were strung and secured below the flooring which had

ample semi-crawling space between the target area and the LP apartment.

RESCIGNO and PARMUTH entered this crawling space by removing a small

section of flooring located inside the LP apartment.

There is also a trap door

leading into the crawl space at the front entrance hall of the building although

the curious would be discouraged to enter this area because of stagnant water

six to ten inches deep on the floors at all times, cob webs, bugs, etc., etc...

was found that the throw bolt located inside the lock was broken. For

room to check if these locks were in the same bad condition. In each case,

when the key was inserted into the lock and turned excessively, the throw bolt
