subject dangerous. William Ray Dobkins' family came to

Washington, D. C., to be present at the D. C. Mental Health

Commission hearing and requested that William Ray Dobking be

released to their custody for return to Texas. DI. Grodsky

recommended that due to William Ray Dobking' profound disl1ke

of the President and his paranoid ideas, that he be held for

further treatment and eventually transferred to an institution

in his state of residence.

At the Mental Health Commission hearing in

the President regarding their land problem.

Regarding Willian's two brothers, both of whon

attended the hearing and one whose name was

Janes Dobkins

of Houston, Texas, DI. Grodsky explained that the limited

Initial stages of the interview. William Ray Dobkins related

his extreme dislike of the President for being responsible

for the loss of his mother's 7,000 acre ranch in vest Texas.

William Ray Dobkins felt that the President and "his bunch"

which consists of Governor Connally and Judicial Officers

In Texas, were responsible for taking the ranch away from

then. Several times throughout the interview, Willian stated

that he would not make any attempt to kill the President,

since he was more good to him alive than dead. As the inter-

view continued, William displayed numerous signs of mounting

anxiety and nervousness and related evidence of paranoid-

type thinking. He closely associates himself in the image

of lee Harvey Oswald, comparing Oswald's history with his

Intentions of defecting to Cuba or the Soviet Union and his

prior U. S. Marine Corps service.

William Ray Dobkins was queried about his admittedly

visiting the State Department in Washington, D. C., and

the Soviet Embassy regarding intentions to defect.

W1111am

claimed that his purpose for going to the Soviet Union or to

Cuba would be to publicize the injustice and the scheme of

the President "and his bunch" taking the land away from his

family. When asked if he had visited the Soviet Embassy in

December, 1966, he replied in the negative but volunteered

the information that his brother, James, had visited the

Embassy inquiring about visiting

the Soviet Union.

When questioned of his feelings regarding the

assassination of President Kennedy, he replied that he

thought Oswald was a good man and

that assassinating the

President was a "good thing" to do if it would prove

his

point or bring to the attention of the Nation a particular

problem. At this point, William reiterated that he had not

thought of assassinating the President, nor would he gain

assassinating the President; however, if the President was

killed, he certainly would not be remorseful about 1t.

JAMES EDWARD DOBKINS

With regard to his brother, James', visit to the

Soviet Embassy, William Ray Dobkins stated that when he left

Texas to visit Washington, he told his brother James his

intention of coming to Washington to find out about, a

"Presidential land holder" which directed that his family!s

case regarding their land problem, be revieved, and that he

was leaving for the Soviet Unlon.

His brother, James,

replied that he would think about the matter some more and,

if necessary, what he (James) was going to do would be worse

than defecting. William Ray Dobkins volunteered his Impression

of his brother's statement that he was intending on

assassinating the President. He further stated that if his

brother had any intention of assassinating the President,

he would not do anything to stop him, since he feels that

his brother would ultimately be judged justifiable in his

actions in a subsequent trial after the country and jury

learn the true facts about their land plight.

•It was the opinion of the Secret Service Agent,

concurted to by Dr. Grodsky, that William was intelligent,

cunning, defensive, and hostile, and when pushed or under

stress, as exhibited by the interview, he exhibits underlying

paranoid ideas. It was also evidencedthat William was not

speaking out his full feelings or intentions.

It was also the opinion of the Secret Service

Agent that William Ray Dobkins should be considered of

extreme protective interest due to his profound dislike

of the President; his underlying paranoid ideas of his

comparison with lee Harvey Oswald, and his thoughts about

assassination to prove his plight; coupled together with

his cunningness, hostility, intelligence, and defensive

attitude.
