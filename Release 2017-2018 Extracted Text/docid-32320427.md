Title: (U) JFK TASK FORCE

Synopsis: (U) On 8/20/96, the Assassination Records Review Board

will formally advise the

FBI of their determinations on FBI

documents.

The FBI has a limited mandated time frame in which to

appeal these decisions.

Enclosures:

(U) Evidence provided by the JFK Task Force in

support of

maintaining the postponement and the documents with

postponements highlighted.

An outline of comments made by the

ARRB's General Counsel (Tab A).

628-66-7019205-1335

Details: (U) On 8/20/96, the ARRB will formally advise, by

letter to the Director, the determinations voted by them on FBI

documents at meetings. held 8/5 - 6/1996.

The ARRB letter will

list 99 documents for which the ARRB made determinations. The

ARRB sustained the postponement of 24 true name informants, one

of which was classified, and 28 symbol number informants, three

of which were classified, until August 2006. The FBI is in

agreement with the ARRB's determination to postpone or open

information in 26 of the documents and 14 are duplicate

documents. The remaining 59 documents the ARRB voted to either

sustain some, but not all of the information requested by the FBI

or open the documents in full.

these 59 documents will reveal the identities of 137 individuals

who were described as potential criminal informants (PCI),

potential security informants (PSI),

sources of information,

confidential sources (CS) and

established sources.

(U) The 59 documents pertaining to the decisions from

the current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed

below by document number with the information to be released.

The current status of informants and sources, if found through

research, is noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D),

no record (NR) or date of birth (DOB).

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting

the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular

information, technical information, classified information

related to

methods,

sources, and foreign relations as listed

above:

However, the ARRB supports the position that the

information ordered disclosed is relevant and significant to the

assassination and that it outweighs any harm that would be caused

to the individuals or the FBI's/United States Government's

foreign relations, informants, or operational aspects which they

voted to disclose.

(U) If CID or NSD recommend appeal, they are requested

to provide their opinion and reasons to the JFKTF and OGC by

8/22/96, as the FBI only has 7 days to appeal upon receipt of the

letter.

If you have any questions, please contact Carol L. Keeley

at extension 9494 or Carl Valentine at extension 9476.

The ARRB sustained the postponement of PCI William H. Reed (L)

until August 2006.

The ARRB opened the afternoon session of their 8/6/96

meeting to the public.

At this session, Mr. Steve Tilley of the

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provided an

update on the different federal agency's transferral of documents

Mr. Tilley reported that the FBI had made three

transfers since his last public report. Mr. John Pereira and

Mr. Barry Harrelson of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

presented a sworn statement concerning the CIA's sequestered

House 'Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) records. The CIA

statement was a historical depiction of the collection,

documentation and sequestering of their HSCA records.

The ARRB's General Counsel T. Jeremy Gunn provided an

overview of the problems associated with the review of HSCA

records.

The CIA'S HSCA records were collected based on the

names of individuals requested by the Committee.

Mr. Gunn

presented several issues related to the review of the material,

such as there is no documentation concerning the theories

surrounding the requests, so it is very difficult

to determine

relevancy to the matter.

He made suggestions for guidelines for

the review of the material and the determination of the relevance

of the material.

The ARRB provided a time frame until September

15, 1996 for the public to send the ARRB their comments on this

issue.

Should the ARRB Board accept their staff's

recommendations, the guidelines will be applied to their review

of the FBI's HSCA documents. However, if the public requests the

ARRB to have the FBI respond to the matter of its HSCA records or

the Board accepts different guidelines, which cannot easily be

applied to the FBI's records,

a sworn statement concerning

The ARRB staff suggested guidelines are:

1. The ARRB staff reviews all records and files in the HSCA

collection.

2. The documents determined to be relevant by the staff will

have the postponements

reviewed word by word by the Board, as was

done in the core files.

Re:' (U) 62-HQ-1029205, 08/19/1996

The files determined not to be relevant by the staff will be

described in a memorandum identifying the file and describing the

review process and the explanation as to why the document is not

relevant.

4. The files having some documents which are relevant to the

assassination will receive a word by word review of the

postponements by the Board for the relevant portion and a memo as

described in #3 for those not relevant documents.

Any files on microfilm which have not already been processed

will be reviewed word by word.

6.

In files which only a portion of the document is relevant

that particular portion could be released and the irrelevant

matter could be redacted.

Re :

ADDENDUM:

INTELLIGENCE SECTION (IS) , CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE

DIVISION (CID): 8/22/96; P: pRe

Reference 8/3/95 CID

addendum to memorandum dated

7/28/95 to William E. Baugh,

Jr. from John A. Hartingh, entitled

"JFK Task Force."

Based on the general rationale articulated in the

referenced addendum, and that set forth below, the CID takes the

following position with regard to those proposed releases

relating to CID sources.

Tab 1) PSI Arturo Gonzalez - No recommendation - This

source was administered by the National Security Division (NSD);

accordingly, the NSD should make the appeal determinations.

Tab 2) PCI David Goldberg - Appeal - This individual

was unable to provide any information relating to the Kennedy

assassination that would justify a public compromise of his

identity.

Absent a showing either that he has been contacted

about and has agreed to the proposed disclosure or, if he is

dead, that an attempt was made to contact his survivors, the CID

cannot support the release.

Tab 3) PCIs Henry Edward Getz, Reuben Zinman, Frank

Kish, and Arthur Hurd - Appeal - These individuals were unable to

provide any information relating to the Kennedy assassination

that would justify a public compromise of their identities.

Absent a showing either that they have been contacted about and

have agreed to the proposed disclosure or, if they are dead, that

an attempt was made to contact their survivors, the CID cannot

support the release.

Tab 4) PCI Thomas J. Stapleton - Appeal - This

individual was

unable to provide any information relating to the

Kennedy assassination that would justify a public compromise of

his identity. Absent a showing either that he has been contacted

about and has agreed to the proposed disclosure or, if he is

dead, that an attempt was made to contact his survivors, the CID

cannot support the release.

Tab 5) PCIs George Edward Bauer and William Burton

Dodson - Appeal - These individuals were unable to provide any

information relating to the Kennedy assassination that would

justify a public compromise of their identity.

Bauer has been

confirmed as dead; however, absent a showing that an attempt was

made to contact his survivors, the CID cannot support the
