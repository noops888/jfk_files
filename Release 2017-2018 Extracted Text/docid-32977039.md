sal.

This will confirm telephoned instructions fron Inspector Peterson on the

evening of February 5, 1964 concerning the above captioned matter.

As instructed, I flew to Bonn the morning of February 7, 1964 to handle

this matter as per report attached.

No one on the security side at the Embassy in Bonn was aware of our presence

in Europe.

When Inspector Thacker was here we discussed the possibility of

arranging for the State Department to notify all Embassies and Consulates

in Europe, Alrica and the Middle East, and to revise their present consulate

instructions, copy of which we obtained fron the Consul General at Paris.

Actually, the instruction concerning counterfeiting should be unclassified.

Matters relating to our security interests could well be the subject of

another classified instruction which should provide that PR subjects of the

Roemer type, coming to the attention of the Missions, should be reported

to you through State Department channels and to this office as well.
