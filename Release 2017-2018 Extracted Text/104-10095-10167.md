¿Tear that Mr. l is Antonio Carlos VECIANA Blanch (201-312966) :

VECLANA,

an assistant bank manager and past president of a public

accountants

association

in Havana, first contacted CIA in Havana s3

in December 1900 when he asked the COs, at that timel

to help in an assassination plot

against Castro.

VECTANA asked

for visas for ten relatives of the four men assigned to kill Castro,

also requested four MI rifles with adapters for grenades plus

eight grenades.

The COS did not encourage VEGIANA and subsequently

checked

with an Embassy officer who reported that VECIANA had made

similar "wild-eyed" proposals to

him.

On 23 November 1961 the

Miami News published a report of an unsuccessful attempt by Antonio

VECIANA to kill Castro.

VECIANA reportedly had arranged to

assassinate Castro and Cuban: President Osvaldo Dorticos on 5 October

in Havana, but the bazooka he was using failed to fire.

4 :

There has been no Agency relationship with VECIANA. A

POA, which was granted for his use in para-military affairs in

January 1962, expired in November 1962.

VECIANA was born on •

4 October 1935 in Havana.

He was a member of the People's Revo-

lutionary Movement, an anti-Castro group in Cuba during 1960-61, and

was one of the founders of Alpha-66.

A certified public accountant

by trade, VECIANA was with A.I.D: in La Paz in 1908-72. VECIANA

was registered in. ISR to the U.S. Army in November 1962 and he

was terminated without prejudice in July 1966. On 23 July 1962

VECIANA was interviewed, at his request, by Mr. Harry. Real from

the DCD New. York office.

VECIANA asked Real to arrange a meeting

with a senior CIA officer to discuss Alpha-66's plans to

"assassinate

Castro and to request CIA's assistance (U:S. $100,000; 10,000: Cuban

pesos; 48 hand grenades). There is no indication that this request

was ever acted upon by CIA.

rould look into the BABALA

matter and would probably arrange for

ZABALA to be contacted in Puerto Rico.

There is no indication in the file that any Agency officer

in contact with VECIANA ever used

an alias Morris Bishop.

There is

no Morris Bishop listed in true name in the DDO rolls.

There was

never any contractual relationship with VECIANA and he was not

paid CIA funds.
