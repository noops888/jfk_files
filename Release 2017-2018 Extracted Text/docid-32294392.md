Re CO Daily Suraary Airtel, 2/26 and 2/27/62.

For the infornacion of Chicago, there is so Taylor

Construction Company listed in curient Tanps telephone and

city directories.

Tampa Office indices check failed to

datinitely establish specific identity of FARRARA nentioned

in referenced airtels.

The following observations vere made by Danpa in

that on page 7 of daily summary of 2/23, it was inierred

that FERRARA Tas 1a Chicago riding an elevator.

BRADE"S Clothes

which were in storage and FERRARA had not

acconplished his part as well as fact that apparantly SaTO

WAS DOSISTIRE FLIZARA and/Or BRADY to obtainciother.

it is inferred that TONY's wife wasin a hospital

Beach and inferred that some guy was soing to be

aa Dansd Beach or Tuesday,

apparently with BRADY's clothos.

Chicago top hoodlum, which infers that BRADY was interested,

with other figures, in construction and financial fields

in Miant Beach or Las Vegas, which would apparently furnish

& legitinate front.

Among matters discussed was that BRADY apparently

was interested in getting since last October or Novenber,

1961, his clothing

"there", which location is unkaovh,

apparentLy had a FeRrARA, not further known nor described,

setting for him the clothing with the assistance of SANTO

(who nay be identical with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, top hoodlum

in the Tampa Office) who was residing in Miami.

The Chicago Office has desired interested offices

to

possibly identify the FERRARA.

On 3/1/52, Cs IP 51-C at Tampa, FLorIda,

whose

identity is known to the Bureau and who is interested in

activities in the SANTO TRAFFICANTE, Tampa residence, 2505

Bristol Ave., made available the information that there

had been a railway express memorandum reflecting

delivery

date of 12/28/61

to JOSEPHINE TRAFFICANTE, which consistea

of three pieces, shipper was Ferrara Confectionery Company,

New York, New York, receipt number 31973. Source unable to

fornish anything further,

but it is noted that JOSEPHINE

TRAFFICANTE 1s the wife of SaNTo TRAFfICaNtE.

The information obtained on 3/1/62 suggests a

possibility that Ferrara Confectionery Company of New York

may have some connection in this matter, and, therefore,

unless advised to the contrary by the Chicago Office, New

York should immediately ascertain all information concerning

Ferrara Confectimery Conpany, New York, New York, endeavoring

to establish why such an intermediary would be necessary for

shipment of clothing, if such be the clothing or possessions

Of LOU BRADY as suggested through Chicago source, considering

that if they are BRADY's possessions, they may be coming fron

Cuba and Ferrara Confectionery Company may have some illicit

trade or connection with Cuba or nay

even by engaged in

assisting in getting goods of

former gamblers out of

Havana,

Cuba.
