La

The attorney, named G. WRAY

AST lIindicated that

HEBERT had contacted GIll and another MARCELLO attorney, Mr.

WASSERMAN, as well as CARLOS MARCELLO recently at MARCELLO'S

camp at Little Farms, Jefferson Parish.

HEBERT apparently

told MARCELLO and his attorneys that although he had told

the FBI or Justice Department attorneys that MARCELLO had

hired him to kill NOLE; that this had been strictly oral and

he had never given a written statement. He told MARCELLO'S

attorneys that the FBI and/or the Justice Department attorneys

my are or ta sunti

had offered him $75,000 to testify that he had been hired to

kill NOLE. Supposedly at this meeting with MARCELLO and his

attorneys, HEBERT

a signed statement in which he has

allogedly related that he had never actually been contacted

by MARCELLO or anyone else to kill the Government witness

NOLE. Informant stated that supposedly HEBERT and the

ed that s

MARCELLO attorneys are of the belief that the Government

does not know that HEBERT has gone to MARCELLO and his

attorneys and given a statement refuting his previous

testimony as a Government witness.

Informant stated that GILL appeared to be very

optomistic that MARCELLO would be acquitted of the bribery

charges against him pending in USDC; further MARCELLO's

attorneys wanted the attempted murder and bribery charges

brought at the same time in USDC.

Apparently the Departmental

Attorneys had requested the court to hear the bribery and

attempted murder charges separately. Informant also stated

that HEBERT had indicated taMARCELLO and his attorneys that

he had been an undercover man for the Government in connection

with the JIMMY HOFFA case.

Informant also advised that BENNIE LE HANN, presently

operating a motel and restaurant for CARLOS MARCELLO in

Alexandria, Louisiana, had bilked MARCELLO out of $25,000.

Informant did not know if LE HANN was still operating the

motel in Alexandria or not.

Informant also stated that GILL's former

investigator DAVE FAIRRIES

(phonetic had recently beei

operating a

gas station

on Airline Highway near the airport

FAIRRIES had started this station on money loaned him or on

credit from CARLOS MARCELLO. FAIRRIES allegedly lost control

of this gas station as the gas company owning the station

learned of his past reputation.

Informant also stated that a millionnaire by the

name of LEE RATTNER (phonetic) from Miami, Florida, was

coming to see CARLOS MARCELLO for a conference at Little

Farms to buy the acreage around Little Farms.

Supposedly

the land involved was to be used as an expressway.

Informant also stated that while riding around

with G. WRAY GILL, GILL stated he wanted to go to an address

on Loyola Avenue to look at some stolen property he might

be able to use.

He and GILL stopped at 4737 Loyola Avenue

and looked at some of the alleged stolen property which

consisted of duplicating machines, dictaphones, IBM calculating

machines and the like.

The above was considered very pertinent as it

indicates possible defense plans MARCELLO's attorneys may

use in VARCELLO's coming trial for jury tampering. It is

also considered good intelligence information concerning

the well-known New Orleans criminal attorney G. WRAY GILL.

On a 5/22/65 contact with informant, he advised

that he has been having considerable trouble with a well-known

madam KAY ROBERTS. ROBERTS had taken over one of the informants

best prostitutes by the name of POLLY SUE HARRINGTON. In

connection with this, he had put much "heat"' on ROBERTS and

HARRINGTON.

HARRINGTON is a close friend of EARNEST PALMISANO,

who in turn is a very close associate of CARLOS MARCELLO.

Apparently HARRINGTON told PALMISANO about informant's

possibly harming HARRINGTON. PALMISANO in turn went to

CARLOS MARCELLO who told PALMISANO that if HARRINGTON could

come up with $500, MARCELLO would arrange to have four men

beat up the informant to where he would be hospitalized for

at least three months. The four men to be hired to beat up

the informant were to be lead by one of the CONFORTO brothers

named JUNIOR. The informant learned of this through HARRINGTON

who apparently decided, at the last moment, that she did not

want the informant maimed.

Although the above is a minor instance, it points

out that CARLOS MARCELLO is an individual who can be contacted

to arrange for "muscle!'.

It is also interesting to note that

informants have previously described the CONFORTO brothers

as being very important cogs in the Italian Criminal Element.
