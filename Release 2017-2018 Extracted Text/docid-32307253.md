ADMINISTRATIVE

INVESTIGATION IN THE PITTSBURGH DIVISION

Contact with various sources and informants during

the period of January 3, 1968 to February 20, 1968, resulted

in the information that they either did not know subject or

did not know what connection he has with the MANNARINO

group in New Kensington, Pennsylvania.

None knew whether

or not he is a member of La Cosa Nostra.

The investigative period reflects investigation

conducted by the New York Division not available at time

referenced Miami report was prepared.

An information copy of instant report is being

furnished Pittsburgh because of subject's close association

with GABRIEL MANNARINO and his periodic yearly visits to

New Kensington, Pennsylvania.
