4o Meyer Lansky

Background

Meyer Lanksy was born July 4, 1902 at Groano, Russia.

He is also known as Morris Lieberman, Meyer the Bug, Bugsy Meyer,

Bugs

Meyer, "The Bug" and Little Meyer. He first entered the rackets

as a sub-lieutenant of the notorious Dutch Goldberg and worked as

an alcohol runner for Goldberg along with Benjamin "Bugs" Siegel.

Later, Siegel and Lansky formed the well-known "Bugs-Meyer" gang.

This group with headquarters in New York City was reported to have

been the head of the organized racket syndicate in that area. In

1939 Lansky was engaged with Frank Erickson in the operation of

the Oriental Race Track and Nacionale gambling casino in Havana,

Cuba.

Associations

During July of 1946 Lansky was in the vicinity of Las.

Vegas, Nevada, and Los Angeles, Califomia, in contact and confer-

ence with Benjamin "Bugs" Siegel, who at the time was engaged in

the erection of the Flamingo Hotel at Las Vegas. Information has

been received from time to time that Lansky'was one of Siegel's

financial backers.

Moe Sedway has identified Lansky as one of the

group, including Siegel, Frank Costello, Joe Adonis and the

emants of the Capone gang, who were attempting to take over the

Continental Press Service, which was engaged in furnishing race

track information throughout the United States.

This informant

also indicated that Siegel, Costello, Adonis and Lansky controlled

the numbers racket in New York City and in Philadelphia. Adonis

is also reported to have been a partner with lansky in the ownership

of the Colonial Inn at Miami.

During the incarceration of Charles "Lucky" Luciano at

Sing Sing and Great Meadows Prisons, New York City, Lansky was one

of his most frequent visitors. Lansky also visited luciano at

Ellis Island wen the latter was awaiting deportation proceedings.

Financial Interests

Confidential informant Moe Sedway has stated that Meyer

Lansky of the so-called "Jewish group" and Joe Adonis of the so-called

"Italian group" are the two men who control the joint activities

of racketeers and mobsters in what is referred to as the "Eastern

Criminal Syndicate." This same informant has mentioned that Meyer

Lansky in conversation had confirned the newspaper reports that he

had recently gone to Italy to visit Charles "Lucky" Luciano.

Another item mentioned by this infornant concerning Meyer Lansky

was the fact that Lansky was quoted as making a statement that he

intends to get his son Paul into the United States Military Academy

at West Point and that he has the necessary political influence to

make this effort successful.

Iansky's chief business connections apparently are

with

the Emby Distributing Compnay, Incorporated, with offices in New

York and Philadelphia. The company controls the "juke box! industry

in these cities and reportedly has used gangster tactics to prevent

the use of "juke boxes" obtained from sources other than their own

organization.

Unconfirmed reports state that the Emby Distributing

Company has

been succeeded by the Consolidated Television Company

This latter company is reportedly engaged in the manufacture of

television sets for sale to bars and grills as well as to distributors

and dealers.

Iansky also has connections with a produce and fruit

company, a food company, a realty corporation, and a retail grocery

organization.

Carol Huber, a New Orleans informant, who is employed in

the Auditing Office of the Beverly Country Club, made available a

list of owners of that club.

An ownership interest of $60,000 was

indicated for one lansky, first name not shown.

It was believed that

this person was Meyer Lansky although Jake Lansky, his brother, could

be acting as a front in this instance. It is noted that Frank

Costello's ownership interest in this

club was shown on this list

as $60,000 also.

Informants of the Miami Office have advised that Meyer

Lansky is one of the leaders in the so-called National or Eastern

Syndicate which includes Frank Costello, Frank Erickson and Joe

Adonis. This group is presently believed to control gambling in

a large area of Miami Beach.

This same syndicate is also believed

to control the Club Greenacres and the Club LaBoheme, the two

largest gambling casinos in Broward County, just north of Miami,

Florida.

Criminal Record

Confidential informant Ira Sample of the Los Angeles

Office reported that Frank Erickson suspected Meyer Lansky of

arranging for the 1947 murder of Bugsy Siegel without conferring

with either Frickson or Frank Costello.

Lansky's criminal record shows arrests for felonious

assault on two occasions, for homicide, for violation of the National

Prohibition Act, for violation of Penal Law No. 1752 (nature of

charge unknowm) and "suspicion" There is no indication that he

was ever convicted on any of these arrests.. At the present time

Lansky resides at 211 Central Park West, New York City
