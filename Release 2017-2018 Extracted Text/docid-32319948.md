Memorandum from J. Kevin O'Brien to Mrs. Morris, dated 3/26/96

Re:

JFK Task Force

62-HQ-1029205

DETAILS: On or about 4/2/96, the ARRB will formally advise, by

letter

to the Director, the determinations voted by them on FBI

locuments at meetings held 2/29 - 3/1/96 and 3/18 - 19/96. The

ARRB letter will list determinations including the following

actions: the release of 44 potential criminal informant (PCI)

identities, the protection of seven PCIs, the release of 20

potential

security informant (PSI) identities, the release of 2

individuals Identities listes

release of 11 Cuban sources, the protection of the technical CS_

surveillance on the Israeli

moassy, Washington, D.CH the

release of intormation from a technical surveillance on the Cuban

Mission, the release of information from a technical surveillance

of a Polish diplomatic establishment, and the

• sustainment of all

information related to the "Soviet"

matters with a release date

of August, 1996.

Of the 41 documents, the FBI is in agreement

with the ARRB decision to sustain the postponements in 12

documents. 1%

A review of the ARRB decisions to date provides the

following observations:

a. individuals listed as PCIs in FBI documents for

which the FBI Headquarters and field office confidential indices

are

negative or a review of FBI records determines the PCI

deceased

without a potential threat to family members are

released; those PCIs that the FBI provides background for, but

can

not determine if

they are living or deceased, the ARRB is

deciding by birth date whether to release; and those PCIs the FBI

was able to establish as still living, and involved in criminal

activity are protected for 10 years;

b. individuals listed as PSIs are only protected if

they have provided life threatening information, those PSIs or.

SIs providing information on communist party matters or anti

Castro matters have been released; the ARRB staff has suggested

that PSIs or SIs who were possibly double agents or working

closely with foreign establishments where a potential threat

could be perceived would be protected, but this situation has not

yet been

tested;

c. Cuban

sources are released, these individuals have

usually been listed with common names and are very difficult

searching and positively identifying;

d. sources of information, gambling informants, and

established sources follow the same guidelines as PCIs unless

developed into security sources. (U)

Memorandum dated 3/26/96 to Mrs. Morris from J. Kevin O'Brien

Re:

JFK Task Force

ADDENDUM: CRIMINAI INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION (CID), $/34/96,

SLT:slt

Reference 8/3/95 CID addendum to memorandum dated

7/28/95 to William E. Baugh, Jr. from John A. Hartingh, entitled

"JFK Task Force."

Based on the general rationale articulated in the

referenced addendum,

and that set forth below, the CID takes the

following position with regard to those proposed releases

relating to CID sources:

Tab 1)

a) PCI Jack Patrick Hanratty - Appeal - Although

the source is deceased, there is no information regarding the

existence of surviving

family members.

The source was used as a

top echelon informant for a five year period. Due to his access

to high levels within organized crime circles, and their known

penchant for violent retaliation, the CID cannot consider

supporting a disclosure of his

assistance to the FBI - even as a ...

PCI - absent an effort to locate and contact survivors to

ascertain the potential impact of the proposed disclosure on

them.

b) PCIs Jack Marvin, Mary Halbouty, Ceasar J.

Ferris, Robert S. Yarrington, J.H. Stelfox, Charles

• B. Flora,

Barney Hai, Ralph Greenwood Salter, Leonard Simpson, J. C.

Stephenson - Release - A good faith search of Bureau and public

records has revealed no data allowing the PCIs to be further

đata a

identified located, and advised of the proposed releases.

c) PCI Phil Bordonaro - Appeal Unless

Reassessment Following Ten Year Postponement Is Allowed - A ten

year extended postponement is insufficient if it mandates

automatic disclosure at the end of that period and would preclude

the FBI from contacting the PCI to re-assess the risks of

disclosure.

d) PCIs Vance F. Bordelon and Marion C. Pearson

Appeal - There is no information reflecting efforts to determine

the existence of surviving family members of these individuals.

Accordingly,

the CID cannot consider supporting a disclosure of

the sources' assistance to the FBI - even as PCIs - absent an

effort to locate and contact survivors to ascertain the potential

impact of the proposed disclosure on them.

e) PCI|

- Appeal Unless Reassessment

Following Ten Year Postponement Is Allowed - A ten year extended

postponement is insufficient if it mandates automatic disclosure

at the end of that period and would preclude the FBI from

contacting the PCI to re-assess the risks of disclosure.

f) PCIs Vincent Locicero and Wade Hansen -

Appeal - There is no information regarding the existence of

surviving family members of these individuals - one of whom was a

symboled source, and the other of whom provided information on a

number occasions. Accordingly, the CID cannot consider

supporting a disclosure of their assistance to the FBI - even as

PCIs - absent an effort to locate and contact survivors to

ascertain the potential impact of the proposed disclosure on

them.

Tab 2)

a) PCI E. L. Keith - Appeal - The source was

subsequently opened as a symboled source and utilized as such for

a 5 year period. Although he/she deceased, there is no

information regarding the existence of surviving family members.

Accordingly, the CID cannot consider supporting a disclosure of

his assistance to the FBI - even

as a PCI - absent an effort to

locate and contact survivors to

ascertain the potential impact of

the proposed disclosure on them.

b) PCI Kit Pettigrew - Appeal - Records indicate

that

he is still alive.

The CID cannot consider the releasing

his identity unless/until he is contacted and agrees to the

proposed disclosure.

Released no good each a chard Thorne

C) PCIs B. Howard Thorne and Ralph T. Trujillo -

Release - A good faith search of Bureau and public records has

revealed no data allowing the PCIs to be further identified

located, and advised of the proposed release.

d) PCI Edmond Zufferey - Appeal - It is unclear

as to whether this name has already been released. If no release

has occured, the CID cannot consider a release, until he is

contacted and agrees to the proposed disclosure, or

until a good

faith search of Bureau and public records has revealed that there

is no data allowing the him to be further identified located, and

advised of the proposed release.

Tab 3) PSI Sylverio Hernandez - Appeal - Unless a

determination regarding this source would more appropriately be

made by the NSD, the CID recommends an appeal inasmuch as the

source provided

long-term, albeit sporadic, assistance in highly

sensitive areas; was just

closed in 1985,

and, apparently, is

still alive but has not yet been contacted to

ascertain the

impact of disclosure on him.
