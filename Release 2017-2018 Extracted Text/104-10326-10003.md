OVERSEAS POSTS. A VACANCY-NOTICE WILL BE ISSUED SOON FOR

D/OPS.

PAGE :

MCLAUGHLIN EXPLAINED, "WE ARE CREATING OPS FOR SEVERAL REASONS:

--FIRST, WE NEED TO PAY INCREASED ATTENTION TO HOW THE DI SUPPORTS A

RANGE OF KEY CUSTOMERS. IMPROVING SUPPORT TO THE POLICYMAKER AND THE

MILITARY IS A CRITICAL AREA OF INVESTMENT FOR THE DIRECTORATE'S

FUTURE, AND CREATION OF OPS REPRESENTS A STEP IN THIS DIRECTION. BOTH

THE OPS CENTER AND PASS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKING MAJOR

EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR DELIVERY OF DI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND

THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM INCREASED DAY-TO-DAY ATTENTION OF AN OFFICE

DEDICATED TO HELPING THEM REACH THOSE GOALS. SIMILARLY, WE ARE

EXPECTING THE NEW OFFICE TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT SETTING FOR PES--WHICH

IS TO HELP US EVALUATE HOW WE SERVE THE CONSUMER--TO GET ON ITS FEET

--OPS WILL ALSO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT FOR

SUPPORTING DI REPS BOTH HERE AND ABROAD. AS THAT EFFORT BECOMES MORE

IMPORTANT BOTH FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND EXPERTISE DEVELOPMENT, WE

NEED TO BRING MUCH GREATER ATTENTION TO ENSURING THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE

EFFECTIVELY DEPLOYED AND THAI THEY GET THE BACKING THEY NEED. RIGHT

NOW, MOST REPS HAVE NO SINGLE PLACE TO GO FOR SUPPORT; OPS WILL

ENSURE THAT THEY DO. MEANWHILE, OPS WILL WORK WITH THE DI'S COUNCIL

OF INTELLIGENCE OCCUPATIONS TO DEVELOP DIRECTORATE POLICIES ON WHERE

REPS WILL BE MOST USEFULLY STATIONED.

--FINALLY, THE CURRENT ODDI IS TOO BIG. AT MORE THAN |

_PEOPLE, IT

IS ALMOST AS LARGE AS SOME LINE DI COMPONENTS,

TAKING VALUABLE TIME

AWAY FROM ADDI WINSTON WILEY AND ME IN FOCUSING. ON THE NEEDS OF THE

DI AT LARGE. ESTABLISHING OPS WILL MAKE THE REMAINING ODDI MORE

MANAGEABLE, ALLOWING US TO FOCUS MORE INTENTLY ON THE RIGHT RANGE OF

SUBSTANTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES.

I WANT TO STRESS, HOWEVER, THAT OPS IS NOT GOING TO TAKE LARGE

AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES FROM THE REST OF THE DIRECTORATE NOR IMPEDE

DIRECT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DDI/ADDI AND KEY OPERATIONS SUCH AS

THE PRESIDENT'S DAILY BRIEF (PDB) ALL OF THE UNITS COMPOSING THE

OFFICE ALREADY EXIST, AND THE NEW FRONT OFFICE WILL CONSIST OF A

DIRECTOR--NO DEPUTY--AND LITERALLY A HANDFUL OF ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL,

*INCLUDING AN< EXECUTIVE>OFFICER (EXO). OTHERWISE, OPS AND THE ODDI

WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE THE SAME SUPPORT STAFF,

AND THEY WILL BOTH

LOOK AT WAYS TO MAKE THEIR OPERATIONS MORE EFFICIENT. IN THIS WAY, BY

MAKING A SMALL INVESTMENT IN A MORE FOCUSED MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE,

WINSTON AND I BELIEVE WE CAN HELP POSITION THE DI TO SERVE THE

CUSTOMER BETTER--WHETHER IT'S THE PDB RECIPIENT, THE DCI AND DCI,

TRE POLICIMARER RECEIVING CLOSE SUPPORT FROM A DI REP, OR THE WIDE

RANGE OF OTHER OFFICIALS WHO COUNT ON OUR LIAISON AND INFORMATION

RELEASE STAFFS TO HANDLE AN EVER-INCREASING WORKLOAD EFFECTIVELY."

5. DCI SSCI TESTIMONY ON RUMSFELD REPORT AVAILABLE;

ON JULY 29, DCI TENET TESTIFIED-TO THE_SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ON THE FINDINGS OF THE RUMSFELD COMMISSTON-REPORT ON THE

BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT TO THE US- THE TEXT OF HIS TESTIMONY IS

NATIONAL STRATEGIC ASSESSMENTS OF THE DRUG THREAT IN THE US. THE NEW

INCLUDING A YEARLY NATIONAL THREAT ASSESSMENT. THE EXPECTATION

IS THAT WITH THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DOMESTIC

THREAT, I.E., THOSE KEY FOREIGN DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS

CONTROLLING DRUG TRADE IN THE US, WE WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO

TRACE THE LINKS TO THEIR PARENT ORGANIZATIONS ABROAD, AND BETTER

FOCUS OUR OWN FOREIGN COLLECTION, ANALYTIC, AND OPERATIONAL EFFORTS.

PROJECTS: A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING THROUGH THE
