BACKGROUND:

These meetings were held prior to the

National Klonvocation, which was held on 9/2-3/67 at

Tuscaloosa, Ala. J. R. JONES became aware of these

It appears it would be extremely unlikely that a

new NIC letter can be approved and distributed in time to

reach the delegates to the National Klonvocation at Tuscaloosa,

Ala., 9/2-3/67;

Charlotte does not yet have the names of such delegates

from all N. C. Units and it is known that some units have not

yet selected delegates; they will do so during the current week

It will not be possible to send such a letter directly

to the

delegates themselves, even

if Charlotte

should learn of their

identities, because

this is information that would not logically

be available on such short notice to the officials of NIC.

The mailing list available to charlotte, to which

past NIC letters have been sent, comprises leaders of local

units, and in some cases just the Post Office Box of the units.

For such a letter to come

to the attention of

the members,

including the delegates,

it must be mailed in time for the

Secretary or other official to receive the letter, and bring

it up at the next meeting of the Klavern.

Most such meetings

are held in the early part of the week, and anything received

in their local mail later than August 28 will most probably

not come to their attention before the delegates leave on

September 1 for the Tuscaloosa National Klonvocation.

Esteemed Klansmen:

am enclosing a copy of a letter that I directed to

Imperial Wizard Hobert i. Shelton, United Klans of America, Inc.,.

and J. Robeit Jones, Grand Dragon for North Carolina. In this

letter I reluctantly submitted my resignation from UKA. I had

refraingủ from taking this action until after the State Meeting

of UKA sas hold at Salistury on August 6, 1967. I had hopod

that at that meeting sone action might have been taken to enable

you Klansnen to express your displeasure at the leadership of

..J. R. Jones. But again, as I had warned you in my previous

_ letters, that opportunity was not given you.

. "=

• Alter you had been told that elections for Grand Dragon

and other state Ofiicers would be held in August, 1967, the

Imperial Wizard, conspiring with fir. Jones, notified you just

the week before the state meeting, that no election would be

held until february.

How much longer are you food Klansmen

going to wait? Then February cones you will again be notified

that ciections are postponed, just wait. and see.

Will the

Nationai nonvocaiion in Tuscaloosa be the sane kind si taiteraoh?

But you don't. have to walt to affiliate with an honest

Klan organization. Those Klansmen loyal to ne held a state

meeting it. Stokesdale, North Carolina, on August 20, 1967.

Representativos from Guilford County, Winston-Salem, Burlington,

Ormondsville, and Greenville, and other parts of the state were

present. We set up a new Klan organization: Confederate Knights

Of the Ku Klux Klan. I was elected Grand Dragon and i will be

glad to furnish the names of all the other elocted officers to

those of you who are interested. Contact me at post Office Box Es

Greensboro, North Carolina. These officers are elected for a

60-day period, subject to confirmation when the organizational

plans

are completed.

Those of you who wish to affiliate with a democratic,

horest Klan organization where your wishes are given every

consideration and your right to express yoursell guaranteed, join

with us in Confedcrito Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Any man who

has paid his initiation fee into any Klan organization will be

welconed into our organization without payment of any other

initiation fee. Come to our next statewido organizational meeting

which will be held in 60 days.

Yours for a greater Klan!

issued to an entira unit which was formerly connected

with

the

hope

that that person could recruit members from UKA.

This attempt to split UkA in North Carolina and

to diminish its power was successful. In addition to the

The Albenarle Klavern, on January 14, 1959, voted to

disassociate with CKiKk and become an independent organization.

in this klavern. One has been:

instructed to transfer to the West Stanly Klavern of UKA, and

the other has been instructed to remain in the independent

group for the time being..

The RoxoDro Klavern Of CKKKK,

and the Roxboro Ladie's Auxiliary;

have severed aifiliation with CKKKK.and are

operating as an independent organization. The continuance •

of these

in the group is believed necessary in view

of the nature of individuals connected with this group.

The Wadesboro Klavern has also severed connections

with CKKKK and is now an indépendent group. . There is.

in this organization and it is believed necessary to

maintain informant coverage due to the fact that there has been

racial trouble in the Wadesboro area in the past.

to further

weaken UKA.. There are many members of CKIKK who will join any

klan organizazion in existence.

If CKKKK ceases io

function as

an organizatión these members undoubtedly will return to uka.

This is nos desirable: HoweveI., CKKKK should be conirolled

in both its activities and its size.

It is anticipated that several of the units

will noü pay the state office of CKKKK. these back dues and

this will allow

Some of the units, such as Ormondsville and Pitt

County, have indicated they do not intend to pay the state office

any money •

•It is believed that the above-mentioned action will

further. reduce the size of CKKKK.

Since its formation no information has been received

indicating that members of CKKKK have engaged in any acis of

racial violence.

IV. SUMMARY:

~ the above represents a summary af our concinuous

analysis of CKKKK. The Charlotte Office recognizes the

initiation of a rival klan was a very delicate maneuver which

has proved worthwhile. Particular attention has been given to

insure that when CKKKK has done its ultimate damage to UkA it

will be phased out as rapidly as possible. . '

Agents handling CKKKK informanüs have been instructed

concerning the absolute necessity for scaling down informan:

payments where justified, recognizing that the phasing out of

informants covers

a period of time rather than abrupt

discontinuance.

It appears feasiole that action should be taken io

phase out the three ladie's units in CKKKK.

We have

closed

out the files on the whiteville and Whitsett ladie's

units!

I. OPPRATIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION

.

At the present time Charlotte has under corsideration

at the Burcau a proposal for a continuation of the "News of

Interest to the Black Citizens of winston-salem" newsletter,

a series which has been extremely successful in the past against

the BPP at Winston-salem, N. C.

This letter attacks the BPP

attempting to discredit

• them in the ees of the community and

?

thereby decreasing: their support on the basis of their failure

to pay their sills, pregnancy.

Of the female workers; and tailure

in the organizing for the

Revolutionary People's Constitutional

Convention (RPCC). In addition, infornation from camel

indicates there may be some animosity batween JULIUS iHITe

ICORNELL, JR. and IARRY DONNELL LITTLE, the two top men in the

"BP? at winston-salem. On a determination.of a correct approach,

a proposal will be submitted in order to widen this gap.

of the "Committee of

guise of a responsible black church-oriented group developed.

and reduce their newspaper sales. In addition, pursuant to

the "committee of Iwenty-five". to be a church group formed in

opposition to the BPP. more it indicated the desire.

him that he start his own group in opposition. to the BPP until

such time as he could locate the "Committee d Ivonty-fivc."

iren had the opinion. that the newsletter would

sway people who were on the fence in their thinking concerning

the BPp into opposition to the panthers and considered it a

good idea to generate resistande.

IV. DEVELOPMESTS DE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INTEREST

Noting thât BPP members from Winston-salem traveled

throughout the state advertising for people to attend the

RPCC reporting that they would pay all expenses for trans-

portation, meals, etc., this ultimately resulted in the panthers'

transportation being a Hertz Rental truck and private automobiles

along with poor food and accommodations at the RICC which was

very disorganized. Charlotte will, submit additional counter-

intclligence proposals in this regard as the opportunity arises.

GREENSBORO DAILY NEWS

Greensboro, N. C.

BY JACK BETTS

•Dally-News Stait Wrlier

Sen. Robert Morgan, D-N.C., has pub-

icly identified a Greensboro man as a

paid informant on the Ku Klux Klan for

the Federal Bureau of Investigation dui-

Eng the FBI's campaign

of infiltrating

fleft-and-right-wing, hate groups during

the-later Sixties.

In remarks prepared for delivery Sat-

-urday night in Winston-Salem, Morgan

identified the man as "the Rev. Mr.

Dorsett" and said that at the same time

Dorsett was on the FBI payroll, he was

speaking in "a most inflammatory man-

ner" at Ku Klux Klan rallies in North

•-Carolina.

Morgan press aide Neil Hill said the

reference was to George Dorsett of

*Greensboro, a long time participant in

KKK affairs and the chaplain of the

state Klan.

I Dorsett was identified by the Greens-

boro Daily News in

December as the

FBi's principal contact in the state

KKK, but until now his identity has not

been officially confirmed by Morgan, the

FBI or the Senate Intelligence Commit-

dee, of which Morgan is a member.

In a speech prepared for delivery be-

More an audience at Wake Forest Univer-

fity's Law Day observance, Morgan

detailed several instances of what he

But,

assare that "the Rev. Mr. Dorsett, who

was on the FBI payroll at the time,

state."

The Senator quoted Dorsett as saying,

at a Raleigh Kian meeting in 1966,

"We

-don't intend to have any violence it we

"have to kill every nigger in America."

Commented Morgan,

*For an FBI in-

formant te act in this way is most im-

moral. It sets race against race and is a

prelude to lawlessness."

-He also cited the FBI's writing of an-

foit to break up their marriages.

In one such case, he said, the FBI

wrote the wife of a Klansman that her

husband "had taken the flesh of another

unto himself," and in another icter to

the husband of a peace activist, wrote

that "your old lady doesn't get enough

Dear MI.

Lavi:

I-would like to thank you for the courtesy you escenced

by promptly

rasponding Io my requesi to see you.

Your

act:

exemplified the

spirit of coopezation besween the Executive

and Congress which prompted my requesi.

I do feel that my concern that zhe F3I clear for seiease

the documents with which I as concerned deseries your sari-

attention,

While 1 an aware Inat Ena rapeasa

of tha dosu-

ments may confirm the identity of a former FBI informant, =

feel the posiure the bureau has taken in publiciy denying

the events described in the documents ever took place neces-

sitates their release, if only to set the record straight. It

should be noted that the Bureau's public position in this sic-.

ation; as well as in others, has been taken in direct response

to public statements I have

made critical of past improper FBI

activities. Accordingly, it is the confirmation of improper

FBI activity, instead of the identity of the informant, with

which I am concerned. Further, it is my feeling that,

based

on information I have received, the identity of the informant

is already. common knowledge.

The other group of documents for which I sought release

concern FBI actions taken against the

Black Panther Party in

• North Carolina.

These in no way involve a confidential source,

and I anticipate no problems with their clearance. • Under sep-

arate cover I am furnishing Mr. Steve Blackhurst copies of the

' documents for which I seek clearance.

Again, let me express my appreciation to, you for your

as -

sistance in this matter.

ate Board of Elections, and a former State Attorney General.

The article quoted SEAweLl as stating that the klan had better

not initiate any violence "or they have had it" in N. c.

Further, SEAVElL quoted as stating that the State is through

In connection with the previously mentioned newsletters

which vere basically directed to a decrcase in the BPP newspaper

sales and a dccrcase in connunity donations, it is noted that

during 8/70 the BPP gIOUP was Icceiving 2,600 copies of the

nevspaper, horever, sales decreasca and auring 10/70 they were:

down to receiving 1,500 copies of the newspaper. During 11/70,

on three occasions, they were unable to purchase their vockly -
