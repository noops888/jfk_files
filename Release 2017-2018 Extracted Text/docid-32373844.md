SUBJECT: What vould happen 1f Castro died?

1. Introduction.

The Impact of Fidel Castro's sudden death would ob-

Vously have cone Internal repereuenlons on ble Cosmunlet

doninated regime. Hovever, it vould be wishful thinklag to

belleve that the Cuben people vould lamediataly slee up and

overthrow the regime, now that Castxo had departed the

ecene. In view of the tremendous stzides made during the

last five months toward the organization of Cuba Into a

complete police state and the lack of any unified anti-

Castro opposition, there can be little doubt that the de-

aire of Fidel Castro, whether by naturel causes of assass-

Ination, would offer little opportunity for the Ilberation

of Cuba

sassination, Instead of natural arises, the factor of bie

nartydon to the Cuben masses vould further stzengthen tha

pover of the present regime in malatalaing control. Also,

it la probable that the Sovlet Blos would react to such an

eveat with greatly incrossed econonle ald in order to serure

aniatenence of thair establlehed beechheed on the hotttem

continent. Although it la possible to antlelpete the la-

nodiate results of the death by assassination of Pidal Castro.

the end result of such an astion would depand to a groat or

tent on the respoctive effectiveness of the verk of the poltee,

the Connaists, the nilitary, and the ents-Castro groupe.

Cextefaly those Cubane who have gained through the changes

brought about by the Castro revolution would continue to sup-
