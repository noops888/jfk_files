Tadeusz SZULC

(4)3184

The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have

been destroyed.

-I attach, however, a memorandun consisting of

selected entries from his card.

2..

All the information is from the same source, a Polish emigre

who knew sauld personally and also had informants in the Polish Embassy.

3.

There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-communist at the time,

and that he co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed

by the Press Section of the Polish Embassy, and provided him with

"information". It would, however, be unwise. to jump

to the conclusion

that this collaboration took the forn of espionage, since SZULCe does

not seem

to have made any secret of the relationship.

4o

I can find no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an intelligence

officer, but he seems to have been an active

propagandist.

He returned

to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,

stated that he then occupied.
