CONFIDENTIE

FLORIDA

On December 17, 1963, Aldo Vera

Serafin, 1382

N. W. 34th Street, Miami/ advised he is the head of the

American Patriotic Action Movement, an anti-Fidel Castro

organization. Vera said he was, previously connected with

the JGCE, but this organization is no longer in existence

because Sierra ran out of money. Vera said the JGCE is

now inactive, and Sierra has returned to Chicago, Illinois

On January 21, 1964, MM T-I. who has been involved

in Cuban revolutionary

activities for the past four years,

advised that the JGCE has had no activity since about Novem-

ber, 1963; the organization no longer exists; and, Sierra

has

returned to Chicago, Illinois!
