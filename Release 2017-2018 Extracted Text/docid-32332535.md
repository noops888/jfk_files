being withheld pending review of the report at the Bureau

and instructions by the Bureau to disseminate the report.

The information concerning captioned subject's status as

a suspected Cuban Intelligence Service (CIS) agent has

been discussed with District Director ROBERT I. WOYTYCH,

INS, Miami, Florida.

The subject is a suspect

because

of information provided by OLGA GEORGINA GOICOECHEA SALAS

(Bufile 105-129981) .

CIA, Miamt, Florida, originally disseminated

information regarding GOICOECHEA's status as a potential

double agent to Mr.

WOYTYCH subsequent to her debriefing

by CIA in Mexico City.

The relationship of the subjeet to

GOICOECHEA as a suspect was pointed out to WOYTYCH by CIA,

together with CIA's reason for considering him as a suspect.

In order to preclude jeopardizing a potential double agent,

WOYTYCH was requested by CIA to consider the information

regarding the subject and GOICOECHEA as Top Secret.

is believed that WOYTYCH has not divulged to other INS

officials in Miami the relationship between the subject

and GOICOECHEA, and thus if disseminated to INS, Miami

anticipates furnishing the report to WOYTYCH personally.

It is noted that CIA, in furnishing written

information containing the debriefing of GOICOCHEA,

classified the information SECRET.

Because of this

classification, this report is being classified SECRET./

(uj

In order to preclude jeopardizing a double agent;

and to avoid undue embarrassment to INS, the subject's status

as a former informant at INS is not being included in the

details of this report.

Likewise, that part of MN 492-S

report pointing up subject's activity at INS as an individual

of considerable influence, especially that material which

came to the attention of MM 492-S, because of his own status

at INS,

is not set forth in the details because it. could

compromise MM 492-S as an informant.

to his quasi official status on the anti-CASTRO committee

which is information known to many people in the Miami

Cuban colony.

A review of INS records on August 6, 1964,

in addition to the information set forth in the details,

shows that on June 9,

1964, the subject was discontinued

as an informant of INS, Miami, Florida.

On September 17, 1964,

Assistant District Director

CHESTER WOISH, INS,

Miami, clarified the status of

SANCHEZ as an

Informant, and INS' reasons for discon-

tinuing him. At this time, Mr. WISH pointed out that

the subject was in contact mainly with TYRUS MINNIX 01

the Travel Control Office. In summary, WOISH pointed

out that SANCHEZ was discontinued because of reports

received by INS to the effect that SANCHEZ was giving the

impression to the public that he had a "drag," or influence,

with INS.

On September 25, 1964, MM 492-S, who also works

part tine at INS, in furnishing

a report concerning the

subject, stated as follows:

The subject represented the anti-CASTRO exile

organization known as Agrupacion Montecristi, along with

other representatives of other anti-CASTRO organizations,

which formerly met with the principal heads of INS, Miami.

It was the opinion of MM 492-S that this committee

cised tremendous influence over INS insofar as the process-

ing of Cuban aliens was concerned.

MM 492-s opined that the

voice of the subject was respected because of his friendship

with Mr. TYRUS MINNIX of the Travel Control Office. - Be-

cause of this relationship, SANCHEZ had an entre in all

He used a black pocket notebook

similar to those furnished to INS investigators, and

by INS in order to get information which he was supposed to

have reported later to INS.

MM 492-S is of the opinion that

SANCHEZ had considerable influence at INS.

MM 492-S recalled that on one occasion,

Mrs, GERTRUDE LIPPIT, Secretary to Assistant Director

GIDEL, caught SANCHEZ going through a wastebasket and

reported him.

SANCHEZ explained his actions by stating

that he was just looking for an old note of his own which

he had given

to Mr. MINNIX. MM 492-S believes no further

significance was attached to the matter.

MM 492-S further recalled that in approximately

told him to see to a come t translator,

him that INS officials were investigating SANCHEZ

for something relating to money, and the rumor was that

SANCHEZ had asked for money "for doing something or for

giving information."

MM. 492-S did not attach too much

importance to this information, because he knew Mrs. ACOSTA

did not like SANCHEZ.

However, the informant did hear

through another more reliable source at INS that SANCHEZ

was being investigated in connection with a denunciation

concerning a female employee in the Spanish Consulate in

New Orleans, Louisiana, or Tampa, Florida. According to what

492-5 overheard, SANCHEZ is supposed to have taken steps

to change the alien or visa status of some unknown individual,

MM 492-S additionally reported that shortly prior

to September 25, 1964,

the subject told him that he was

not then working for INS,

Miami, but that they had offered

to transfer him to New York with a salary of $75.00 a week.

The records of the Southern Bell Telephone &

Telegraph Company :

Hialeah,

Florida, were made available

to SA EUGENE L. PAYNE on September 28, 1964, by urs.

ALICE HORNSBY. At this time, Mrs. HORNSBY pointed out

that long distance calls billed to subject's telephone are

not available for the period preceding approximately June,

1964.

Miami indices contain numerous references relating

to the very common Spanish name JOSE SANCHEZ. Information

obviously identical to the subject is set forth in the

i ention can tel
