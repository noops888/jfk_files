points that he had to make were some utich my be new and which are covered below.

Varona was shocked over the jenate Intermi seaurity Subcomitte'

choice of Cal, UGALDE CArTIllo to testify bafore them. Varona desoribes this

person as an absolute wur criminal who has no business appearing before any

official United States body.

tbore is not the slightest posalbility that the avarago batin Amerion could ever
