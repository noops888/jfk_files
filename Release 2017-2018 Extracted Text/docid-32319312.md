62-HQ-109060

For the information FBIHQ, in Boston teletype to

the Director, dated January 28, 1992, captioned JOHN F.

KENNEDY Assassination (Bureau File Number 62-109060), the

Boston Division informed the Bureau that it was unable to

locate Boston file 62-3861. This file has now been located

and

pursuant to the instructions received from SSA GRANT HARMON,

FBIHQ, the three original serials contained in this file are

being

forwarded to the Bureau

as enclosures to this airtel.

For the further information of the Bureau, the

Boston Division has conducted five searches for Boston file

175-112. This file is entitled "Assassination of President

JOHN F. KENNEDY". According to Boston teletype to the Director

dated January 28, 1992, Boston file 175-112 was characterized

as follows: "This file

does not reflect any investigation at

Boston. It is a repository for correspondents and public

information regarding the assassination." The Boston

Division obviously reviewed this file shortly before

submitting the above mentioned teletype to FBIHQ. Since that

time five separate searches have been conducted

attempting to

locate it so it could be sent to the Task Force at FBIHQ.

These searches have proved negative and the most recent one

was conducted by MDE MARGARET MUNROE on June 14, 1994. This

search included checking all logical places where the file

could be located including closed files, all Squad Rotors, the

Informant Room, the SAC and ASAC's offices but the search

proved negative as it has so many times in the past. Boston

file 175-112 is listed on the Boston missing file list.

Boston teletype to the Director dated January 28,

1992 also mentioned that Boston file 157-55 also pertained to

JOHN F. KENNEDY but was unable to be located. Since that time

there have been at least two additional attempts to locate

157-55 with negative results. The most recent attempt to

locate 157-55 occurred on June 14, 1994 and the search was

onducted by MDE MARGARET MUNROE. This search included all o

he places mentioned above for the search for Boston file 175

112. Boston file 157-55 is also on the Boston missing file

list.

On June 14, 1994 the Boston Division conducted a

FOIMS check on the

following subjects:

1. JOHN F. KENNEDY Assassination

2. JFK Assassination

3. Assassination of President John F. Kennedy

Records Collection Act of 1992

5. JFKARCA

These FOIMS Indices checks located no additional

records concerning captioned matter. These FOIMS checks

disclosed information contained in Boston File 62-HQ-109060

which is the Boston Division Control File pertaining to

captioned matter.

PLA Boston also checked to see whether the Boston

Division had any files pertaining to "89A-DI-60165" and this

check proved negative.

On June 15, 1994 SSA GRANT HARMON contacted PLA

Boston and requested that a search be conducted for Boston

File 52-8794. SSA HARMON advised that this file was captioned

"UNSUB POSSIBLE THEFT OF JOHN F. KENNEDY AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS".

MDE MARGARET MUNROE and Closed File Clerk ROBERT EMERSON made

an effort to locate this file with negative results. They

determined based upon the date other files around this file

were opened that the file probably was opened around 1985. MDE

MUNROE checked the FOIMS Index in an effort to assist in

locating the file but it was not indexed into FOIMS. Neither

was the file on any file destruction list. MDE MUNROE then

conducted the same type of search for 52-8794 that she

conducted regarding the other missing files and this search

proved negative. PLA Boston does not know where this file is

located.

Boston PLA JOHN MICHAEL CALLAHAN; JI. coordinated

the Boston Division efforts regarding captioned matter. The

actual file searches and various indices searches were

conducted by various support personnel in the Boston Division.
