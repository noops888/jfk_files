Para C:

I cannot match the documents with the list you provided.

Please arrange the articles

chronologically and number. them

lightly in pencil to correspond with numbers in a

memo (see

attached Memo from the DDA, 26 March 76, para bi.

It would be

useful if you would use that format for all your memos, as the

way you have done it is very hard to follow without making errors.

Also clipped documents have parts cut off of them or are almost

unreadable. Can you provide better copies?.

Para D:

1 First document is a report whose number should be left in. Pls

provide another resanitized copy.

2 Please delete dissemination controls in your sanitizations: other-

wise we

just have to do them over. Also classification was left

on one doucment. See dold clips.

3 Please provide sanitized Ist a page of EX-895, 7 Mar & 68.

4 Please delete cite numbers from incoming cables.

Many thanks.

#355 109, dated 10/29/54, which

indicates that on 7 September 1952 ABELt, the Subject of a

"Security

Matter-C" type investigation, communicated with C. SCOTT, Route 1,

Box 158, Heiberger, Alabana, which address was Identified as the resi

dence of Coretta SCOTT. According to the postmaster at Heiberger,

2. Alfreda ABELl, who was a clerk in the UN Secretariat

from 1947 until 6/30/52 when her employment was terminated for security

reasons, was said in the New York Times on ? January 1953 to be one of

25 former employees of the UN ousted as one believed to be a communist

or under conmunist aiscipline.

While employed in the UN, ABELL Was

reportedly active on behalf of the Pro-Communist group of the UN Staff

Committee and was friendly with, and actively participated in giving

a party in October 195t to honor, four persons who had been dismissed

by the UN for security reasons.

(ie: Jeanne PICoU, identified as a

member of the French Communist Party; Mary Jane KEENEY, a CP member

active in the Communist Party underground during the late 30'g-early

40's; Benedict Soloman ALPER, also reported to be a CP member; and

Rajah HOWRANI, who was reportedly a Communist Party member and had

received training in the Soviet Union.

The individual said to be responsi

ble for ABELi's employment in the UN, and to have been her supervisor

there at one time, was Adam TARN, a Polish citizen said to be a Communist

Party member. According to the FBI report on ABELL, she registered with

the American

ABELi and Helen KAGAN, who also was terminated at the UN

Scoretariat for security reasons,

were reported in October 1952 to

ipequently return to the UN premises where they were said to oftan

in soen in its corridors conversing with certain Russians and alleged

Communists.

According to a conficential FBI informant, ABELL in

March 1952 nade a check payable to KAGAN in the amount of $150, and

KACAN had made checks paysole to ABELl, on a number of occasions.

Helen KAGAN is Helen KAGAN-POZNER, AKA: Elena Aleksandrovna Wilga, etc.,

1348 486, rho is suspected of having long engaged in Soviet intelligence

activities. Her brother, Vladimir A. POZNER, is an ide/ fified KGB

ofricar and her cousin, Vladimir Wolf POZNER, is a know. ember of the

French Communist Party and is suspected of involvement in Soviet

intelligence.

Her long-time consort, Peter WIIGA, a leading figure

in the CPUSA, was also suspected of Soviet intelligence connections.

Helen KAGAN-POZNER WIIGA is of continuing interest to the FBI and

to SRS.

4.

At a Senate Internal Security Subcommittee hearing in

New York City In late 1952, Alfreda ABELL refused on grounds of self

Incrimination to say whether she was then or ever had been a communist,

whother she

tried to organize UN workers, or whether since leaving the

UN in the Summer of 1952 she had revisited UN headquarters in the role

of a communist organizer.

The FBI continued to have an interest in

ABELL until at least December 1961, the date of an FBI réport in her

file.

The postmaster at Heiberger, Alabama in advising regarding.

Coretta SCOTT, as stated above, commented that she had in, the past sung

on the same program with Paul ROBESON at ROBESON's personal invitation.

(Louis BUDENZ has stated that prior to his, (BUDENZ), defection from

the Communist Party in 1945, he knew Paul ROBESON as a secret member

of the Communist Party-)

SUBJECT

REFERENCE

Request For Opinion--FOIA (b) (6) &

Privacy Act

:

FOIA Request 76-382, copy attached

1.

Mr. Weisberg has requested under the FOIA

information on:

a. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

b. Earl Ray

c.

Other individuals involved with the

assassination of Dr. King.

2.

To ensure consistency in making determinations

for release under both the FOIA exemptions (b) (6) and

the Privacy Act, of requests such as Mr. Weisberg's,

would you please state the current legal criteria to

apply to these type cases. Specifically, it would be

helpful to the DDO to have a clearly enunciated legal

opinion regarding what, if

any, privacy rights the family

of a deceased individual might

have vis-a-vis the deceased

individual.

Further, what, if any, privacy rights does

a convicted felon have.

3. We are aware that each case must be judged on

its own facts.

Hence, we would be grateful for your

opinion regarding the

criteria to apply to Mr. Weisberg's

request.

However, a general rule applicable to the type

of request also would be very useful, would expedite the

processing of such requests, and would apply some consistency

in the decision-making process.

visitors to the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City

during the recent months.

•2"" Checke for persons appearing to Icsemble thocomposite

photographs were negative at both Embassies. On 30 January

1968 an unidentified white male visited the Soviet Embassy but

the description did not fit either the composite photograph or

the description provided by your Bureau representative.

tive further stipulated that any use of the photographs in an

This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

4/4/68.

₩!

One of the most promising leads developed so far is the laundry

tags appearing on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts apparently abandoned by

the subject with the rifle that is believed to be the murder weapon. It

has been determined that these laundry marks were made by a Thermo Seal

marking machine manufactured by the Textile Marking Machine Company,

Syracuse, New York. The manufacturer of this machine has advised that

the laundry marks in question are unusual in that they consist of five

characters whereas the usual code contains six characters.

These markings are also unusual because the first two characters

are in smaller type while the remaining three characters are in larger

type.':The normal arrangement is for the first three characters to be in

smaller type and for the following characters to be in larger type. The

Textile Marking Machine Company has stated only a limited number of

machines have been manufactured which print laundry marks in this

manner.

Investigation is proceeding on an expedited basis to locate these

machines for the purpose of ident is the law dry marks.

Richard Helms, Director of the Central Intellfgênce AgenCy, has

furnished the Central Intelligence Agency file on Robert Ervin Kramer,:

M. D., Berkeley, California, whom Helmsconsiders a suspect because of

his resemblance to an artist's conception of the subject and becase of the

Central Intelligence Agency's experience with Kramer. The Central

Intelligence Agency file states Kramer has a long arrest record and contains

a Berkeley Police Department photograph, dated 1/27/66, number 22805.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

He has been a chronic letter writer to the Central Intelligence Agency

criticizing them and the Government. By letter of 12/29/67 Kramer

requested the Central Intelligence Agency to pay him $100, 000 monthly

for six months for a paper on geopolitical economy he had previously

submitted. He concluded his letter with the statement, "In the event that

you fail to acknowledge my request, I can accept no responsibility for

any future efforts necessary to gain the combined ends of ideal

government and financial recompense.!!

The only record of Kramer found in Bureau files is a

memerendum from the Central Intelligence Agency, 1/18/69, advising

us of his letters to the Central Intelligence Agency

No record can be

located in the Identification Division but Kramer's fingerprints are being

obtained from the Berkeley police.

A. C. Hayden, Intra-Division Information Unit of the Department,

advised on the evening of 4/8/68 that Beatrice Rosenberg, a secretary in

the Attorney General's office, had received a telephone call from a

man identifying himself as Frederick Dunstan who said he resided at

Route 350, Whitefield, North Carolina.

\ Dunstan said he was calling the

Attorney General to report that a white man was in his house, was drunk,

had a gun and said he had killed Martin Luther King, JIe

There is no Whitefield, North Carolina, There is a Whiteville,

North Carolina®

Investigation by the Charlotte Division has failed to.

locate a Route 350, Box 350, or Highway 350 in the Whiteville area and

no record of a Frederick Dunstan has been located. No record of Dunstan

could be found in Bureau files.

A pair of duckbill pliers was found among the personal effects

believed to have been abandoned by the subject. These pliers bear a

trademark of 'the Rompage Hardware Company, Los Angeles. Employees

at the hardware company believe this is one of twelve pliers purchased in

October, 1966. Employees have no recollection of the sale of these -

pliers but an exhaustive search is being made of charge sale records.

It is noted that the rifle believed to be the murder weapon was

purchased in Birmingham, Alabama, 3/30/68. Binoculars found with the

rifle were purchased in Memphis, 4/4/68. A latent fingerprint found on

the rifle is identical with a latent fingerprint found on the binoculars. This

presents a strong probability that these fingerprints are those of the subject.

Dear Mr. LesaT:

This acknowledges receipt of your letter of 11 June 1976

on behalf of MI. Harold Weisberg requesting, under provisions

of the Freedom of Information Act, access to any CIA records

dealing with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and/or James Earl Ray

and any of his alleged or suspected

accomplices in Dr. King's

assassination.

I shall arrange for a search of CIA files and shall be in

further comnunication with you once the search has been completed

and any records found reviewed for releasability under the Act.

As you may know, the heavy volune of Freedom of Information

requests received by the Agency has resulted in processing back-

logs.

If we do not respond within the 10 working days stipulated

by the Act, it is your right to construe this as a denial, subject

to appeal to the CIA Information Review Committee.

more reasonable, however, for us to continue processing your request

and to respond as soon as feasible. Any denials of records could

be appealed at that time. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we

will assume that this is agreeable to you and proceed on this basis.

for your information, 1 am enclosing a copy of our fee schedule.

If the charges seem likely to be considerable

I shall provide you

with an estimate and perhaps require a partial payment in advance

of processing.

Sincerely,

December 3, 1976

Mr. Gene F. Wilson

Information and Privacy Coordinator

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C. 20505

Dear Me. Wilson:

In response to your letter of November 30, 1976, Mr. Harold

Weisberg has authorized me to state his willingess to pay search

and copying charges up to the amount of $1,000 if such charges are

required by his Freedom of Information Act request for records

pertaining to DI. Martin Luther King, JI. and his assassination.

Because you require a down payment of half the anticipated charges,

I enclose a check for $500.00:

This payment of $500.00 and any subsequent payments made in

connection with this request are tendered with the express reserva-

tion that Mr. Weisberg does not waive his right to recover them.

C.I.A. regulations provide:

Records shall be furnished without charge

or at a reduced rate whenever the Coordina-

tor determines that waiver or reduction of

the charge is in the public interest because

furnishing the information can be considered

/ 11 PM '76

as primarily benefiting the general public.

The Coordinator also may waive or reduce the

charge whenever he determines that the inte-

rest of the government would be served there

by. 32 C.F.R. $1900.25 (a).

In accordance with this regutation, I call upon you to

determine that it is in the public and governmental interest to

waive search and copying charges incurred in connection with Mr.

Weisberg's request.

Enclosed herein is a copy of a letter to Deputy

Attorney General Harold R. Tyler, Jr. which makes a similar request

of the Department of Justice. The reasons expressed in that letter

for granting a waiver are incorporated in my request that you grant

a waiver.

Should you require it, I will provide you with affidavits by

myself, Mr. Weisberg, and others

in support of this request for

waiver of the search and copying charges for these records. If d

do wish supporting affidavits. I would appreciate it if you would

## Page 121

inform me of this as soon as possible. I would also request

that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established

for determining whether or not a request for waiver should be

granted.

You state that you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's

request "unless and until we are in receipt of notarized state-.

ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray,

respectively."

Because Mr. Weisberg's request undoubtedly com-

prises records which do not involve any proper claim of privacy,

this cannot be true. I do enclose, however, a copy of a notarized

waiver by James Earl Ray. I will immediately contact Mrs. King

about a waiver by her.

In the meantime, I request that you proceed

to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's re-

quest which do not involve any proper claim of invasion of privacy.

Sincerely yours,

Jama 1 Ferr

It's the first lie detector that

can be used on a dead

man. It works on tapes and

other voice recordings

by George O'Toole

Assassination Tapes

Tre rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either

at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.

-Plato: The Republic. Book Three

It's a little frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with

a high degree of retiability, whether or not you are lying. It's called the Psychological

Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect. a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs

no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.

It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph

record is tair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on

• a dead man.

Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. I resolved to use

it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President

John F. Kennedy, I set about collecting every recording I could lay my hands on

of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon I had compiled the tape-

recorded testimony of twenty-two persons-eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the

pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,

Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren.

I ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in

turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?

Was Oswald the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-

graphs which the Warren Commission never saw do they support the Commission's

lone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?

Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture I expected. Not

all the details are there, but I guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory

of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark

Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.

The PSE is not a crystal ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function

it performs well. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of its use as a tool

for historical research. To understand what I did with. the PSE, one should know some-

thing about the device itself.

I first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when I met two of

its inventors, Allan D. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuision. Bell and McQuision, both

former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form

a company called Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. It was a logical second

career for the two men. Both are experts in the technology of espionage. Either one

could pick the lock on your front door in less time. than it takes you to find your

key. Colonel Bell wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and

small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit, from anti-bugging devices

to a miniaturized microdot camera. Colonel McQuiston is one of the foremost polygraph

experts in the U.S., a specialist in radio and audio surveillance, and a qualified locksmith.

My own personal opinion? I don't know.

I remember the young man with the ring.

He said he was wearing it, and he was,

but he stressed. He stressed not because

he was lying, but because there was some

thing about that ring that really bothered

him, something he didn't want the world to

know. Perhaps that is also true of these men

who, in one way or another, leamed some

part of the truth about the assassination of

John F. Kennedy.

I suppose I'm not absolutely sure even

of that. When I first met Bob Smith of the

Committee, I asked him if there was any

one thing the govemment could do to clear

up the mystery.

Yes, he replied, the one

thing that would help more than anything

else would be to make available the physi

cal evidence - the detailed FBI lab re-

ports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs

the microscopic slides, the bloodstained

clothing, yes, even the President's brain,

wherever it has been hidden. These things,

he said, would go far toward answering the

questions about what actually happened

that day in Dallas. Maybe they would even

confirm the Warren Report.

So when I say I'm not absolutely certain

these men are concealing something, I

mean I can think of something that could

conceivably change my mind. That is, if the

Attachment to CIR- 316/03107-73

SUBJECT:

Conference of the Committee to Investigate Assassinations,

Report on Proceedings 23 November 1973

1.

The Committee to Investigate Assassinations claims to

have been established in 1969. The headquarters are in Washington, D. C.

(at 1520 16th Street, N. W.). In the four years of its existence the

Committee has done research and has become a kind of clearing

house for the study of assassinations.

It maintains contact with

other groups engaged in similar activity, of which there seem to be

at least two, one of which is located in the Boston area.

In addition to research, the Committee acts to help

individuals interested in the investigation of assassinations. It thus

files suits for private persons demanding access to classified

information. It sponsors the publication of books and articles

relating to the field of its interest, and sponsors the production of

movies. It publishes

a newsletter.

3.

The conference of November 23-24, 1973, is the first of

its type to be held by the Committee. The Georgetown University

was helpful by placing Gaston Hall at the disposal of the Committee

free of charge. By agreement with the University, the Committee

will also be able to use the services of the University Library as a

repository and research center.

The Conference opened on November 23, 1973, with a delay

of about half an hour. The delay may have been due to the installation

of recording equipment which literally covered the premises with a

tangle of wires of every kind. The Washington Post reports an

attendance exceeding 300. This is a generous estimate. After

deducting official speakers, recording personnel, and press

representatives, the audience probably numbered no more than 150,

if that many.

5.

Beards and long hair prevailed, and others stood out like a

sore thumb. There was not a single Negro in the audience, nor, that

morning, on the platform. Even the speaker who spoke on

the case

of Martin Luther King was white.

6. Not all the speakers preannounced were present. The

chairman announced the absence of Richard Sprague. Another

speaker, a lawyer from Los Angeles whose name was drowned

out in the noise, was also absent.

They were replaced by Dr. Robert

Forman and someone whose name sounded like "Ed Kirkley".

7.

The chairman announced that all the speeches would be

tape recorded for subsequent publication. He further invited the

audience to attend movies to be shown that night. One of these,

"Burn"', was to be shown at the University. Others by prearrangement

would be shown at local movie theaters, The latter were connected

with the Kennedy assassination.

The case of the President's murder

was in the center of the conference and, as noted by one of the

organizers (Smith), one half of the speakers were to center their

attention upon the Oswald case.

8.

The chairman adhered strictly to the program and every

speaker mentioned in the program for the morning session of

November 23 spoke as specified. Of those who spoke, Norman

Mailer, Robert P. Smith and Ronald Van Doren deserve particular

attention. Their speeches in summary are reviewed below.

A table at the back of the audience presented recommended

There was also a bibliography of political assassination; the foreword

to which lists the persons most actively collaborating with the

Committee.

10. A publication circulated during the conference was the

November, 1973 issue of Computers and Automation which is to

be renamed, starting January 1, 1974, Computers and People.

The publication of articles such as "Nixon and the Mafia" which

concludes that Richard M. Nixon seems to be the embodiment of

a prediction that organized crime would someday put its own man

in the White House, seems somewhat curious in a magazine devoted

to the profession of data processing and the use of computers.

The magazine was established in 1951 by Berkeley Enterprises in

Massachusetts. Alger Hiss is among its contributors and an

abundance of articles by Richard Sprague on the subject of Watergate

published in the past year.

11. Another organization which received publicity at the

Conference was The Committee for Action/Research on the

Intelligence Community (CARIC).

12. A representative of Computers and Automation handed out

this publication free of charge to members of the audience. He took

notes with fantastic speed and apparent accuracy of everything said

during the proceedings.

13 .

The lights gave out at one point and did not come on again

during the morning session. The absence of current may have

affected the tape recording.

14. The morning session, due to close at 12:30, ended after

1:30 p.m. By this time the audience was impatient to have lunch,

and the resumption of the proceedings was therefore postponed to a

later hour.

No document of any kind was issued to the persons who

paid $15. 00 to enter. Instead their hand was stamped with the name

of the organization which gave them access to all further meetings

that day and the next (the members of the audience were apparently

not supposed to wash their hands during this time). Names were

taken down, but no questions asked other than one's initial. No

information on address, occupation, etc. was required.

16. Speech by Norman Mailer. This was beyond a doubt, the

most striking presentation during the Friday morning session.

Mailer spoke briefly and left the conference shortly after the speech.

17. Mailer said that political intelligence as a subject was as

powerful as "peace". Interest in assassination is obsessive. The

obsession arises from the fact that a solution to the problem is not

found, and attention is constantly drawn back to the unanswerable

question.

18.

He said that we have here the most powerful nation in the

world which cannot come to grips with a question which seems as

amazingly simple as the Kennedy assassination. The result has

been that this nation has decided to shut down investigation and has

thus alienated itself from its own history. This alienation has

brought apathy, a trait noticeable in the reaction to investigations

which bring no wide response.

19. A nation which rejects

its own history is on the path to a

totalitarian regime. Facts, meanwhile, have a peculiar ability to

change when they are investigated, and investigators must therefore

rely upon hypothesis. The history of the last ten years has been

made unendurable by the abundance of hypotheses. . They range

from the opinion that an assassination is an accident lacking any

particular sequence to the hypothesis that secret police forces are

engaging in a world conspiracy.

20.

The present conference must help us to learn whether

there are possibilities, and what possibilities exist, to solve these

questions.

21. Speech by Robert P. Smith. Mr. Smith was described as

the director of research of the Committee, but he seems to be one

of the major motive forces in this organization.

22.

Mr. Smith pointed out that he had spent the last three years

studying the Kennedy case. Much research had been done, but

nothing had changed, so far as practical action was concerned, in

the last nine years.

27. Speech by Ronald Van Doren. Mr. Van Doren seems to be a

follower of Governor Wallace. He began by commenting on the sad

situation in a country with a judiciary where individuals have to make

conjectures regarding a case as obvious as that of Bremer. There is

no doubt that Bremer pulled the trigger. But one should examine the

political situation at the time of his action. Wallace was by far the

leading candidate in the election campaign, a threat to other candidates,

and he was winning the nomination. He represented a challenge to

both parties. Nothing he said could be interpreted as racist, and in

the economic sense he carried wide appeal. The question which faced

the other candidates was how he could be stopped from disrupting the

two parties and from preventing the re-election of the President.

History will show how he was stopped and why this occurred.

28. The case in defense of Wallace's civil rights was quietly

dropped. No proper investigation was conducted. As usual in

assassination cases there was a diary. It showed that Bremer was

acting alone and was deranged. Read as a piece of literature, the

diary presents Bremer as a non-person, an illiterate unable to spell.

There is nothing regarding the people he worked with. Meanwhile, if

one examines Bremer's background, he appears an entirely different

person. Why did he travel repeatedly to Ottawa? How did he manage

to carry guns on planes? What was he doing in New York? Why was

he in Washington? And where did he get his funds? The apartment

he rented exceeds his annual income. His mother could not afford

to visit him in prison, yet he dressed well. With whom was he

involved?

29.

All this should be looked into. Watergate brought the

electoral campaign to the fore. Why has discussion of the Bremer

shooting been excluded from the investigation? Bremer was a part

of the 1972 campaign, yet there is no mention of Wallace or of

Bremer. Two years from now Wallace will be back.

30.

Speech by Ms. Meredith Rode. Ms. Rode was very brief.

She said she became interested in the killing of George Lincoln Rockwell

in 1970, and that the case was built on circumstantial evidence exclusively.

The case is still open, for the police believe that there was an accomplice.

No funds are available for defense.

23.

Although the National Archives are the repository for the

Kennedy assassination documents, the FBI and the CLA are

responsible for restricting research. Much of the 300 cubic feet

of documents have been printed, a reclassification in 1971 has

released 3, 000 pages, and the CIA later released more, but none of

the material released has created any sensation. The Freedom

of Information Act is not as liberal on assassination material as on

other matters. Some material was not even turned over to the

Warren Commission. The FBI and the Justice Department are alone

in knowing the results of some tests.

24. In the non-governmental area, much has been published,

and the book by Peter Noyes must be singled out particularly.

25.

Speech by Mr. Robert Hanson. Mr. Hanson has become

the counsel for Sirhan Sirhan. He studied to become an engineer

and then shifted to law. (To judge from the number of cases which

he says he has lost, heshouldhave remained an engineer instead of

becoming an attorney. )

Mr. Hanson said that the Sirhan case is pretty hopeless.

The trial was based on a 100 per cent belief in Sirhan's guilt.

Therefore important witnesses were not called, and no attention

was paid to ballistics. Scientific study, however, indicates that

Sirhan Sirhan may not even have been the person who committed

the crime. But even if it is proved that his gun did not kill

Robert Kennedy, this discovery may have no influence upon Sirhan's

case. California officials have no desire to reopen the case and

funds to handle the proceedings are lacking. A book by Tiger on

the case is worthy of note. Tiger claims that Sirhan Sirhan was

acting under hypnotic influence.

26.

Speech by James Lesar. Mr. Lesar, who spoke on the

Martin Luther King assassination, declared that Ray was innocent,

and that the FBI and the Justice Department were responsible for

wrongly solving the crime. Ray was framed by conspirators. The

persons presently involved in Watergate played a role in the Ray

case investigation. No private agency - only a government agency -

can solve the Ray case. All depends on whether the judiciary acts

honestly or with political consideration in mind. As it stands today,

we see Ray's rights having been abominably violated; we see lawyers

who did not do their job; and we see nothing approaching an open

hearing.

he headlines in Aficrican newspapers have for years told of Army

cries, attempted coups

and intrigue initiated by the ClA and

westrained

FBI wiretapping.

Wa

all know that Big Brother is

airling, but no one in our government has taken the time to explain

1.? is being spied upon, and why we are being watched. Too often, we

vimerican citizens don't even know who Big Brother is.

in 1955, President •Eisenhower accepted the report of the Hoover

commission on U.S. Intelligonce. Among other recommendations, the

mission emphasized the need for two "watchdog" commitices on

illigence within

the

cxecutive

and leg:slative branches

of

gunment. Although a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (FIAB)

his ise:blished to serve the President, Congress by an overwhelming

?:. pity has refusco to establish a committee within the legislative

t..uh. Now, in the midst of the Watergate scandals, there is some

rainent within Congress to establish committees on the separate

sirilligence agencics. The result will be divided oversight with no

::ance that Congress will he able to stop illegal and unjustified

pj. With Congress abrogating its responsibilities, there is no agency

il government, direcily responsible to the public, monitoring the

Jested States Intelligence Community.

Nois former intelligence workers and concerned citizens have

or ted a national association lo provide the vita information an aware

Millic needs to know about government onerations. The Committee for

d'inn/Research on the Intelligence Comniunity (CARIC) is an

w' pendent "watchdog" on the government spy apparatus. CARIC,

poisored entirely by donations from American citizens, serves as an

Ironative source uf analysis and information on the practices,.

• unization and objectives of U.S. Intelligence. What clandestine

pations are being carried out in the name of America? Is the CIA

a varig to entangle us in another war similar io the Indochina War?

ut information is going into Federal, State, local and private data

cuts on innocent Arnerican citizens? Is the FBI becoming a "secret

i los force?" Whose phones are tapped in America? These are some of

I: ructions CARIC is answering.

¿ARIC knows that all conscientious Americans are closely watching

i suchts that have unfolded since the arrests made at the Watergate

utiling. We share the lope of most Americans that the illegal

pionage practices that have now leen exposal will no longer be a part

• perican political life. Hewever, the disiniardling of one espionage

ral loval 10 one group of politicians does not insure that this abuse

inaer will not be repealed ly future politicians.

Who knows what future political espionage will occur under tha

guise of so-called "hational security" or loyalty to an administration?

Only time will tell, but through diligence and your help CARIC will

anticipate and bring to your attention situations within the government

that are likely to produce a new "Watergate."

Although CARIC does believe that a massive government spy

apparatus is at work in the world, we hope to dispel some of tho

paranoia citizens naturally foel when there is talk of spics and wiretaps.

We know that the FBI does not have agents behind every tree, but there

are agents in every major community in this country who have spied on

innocent private and public citizens. Only a full and undisguised look

into this hidden world can displace unwarranted fears, and guide the

public effort to end this illegal and unjustified espionage. The secrecy

with which the government surrounds itself must end.

CARIC knows that tens of thousands of American citizens from all

walks of life were mobilized over the past decade to help bring an end

to the government's war in Indochina - a war that has taken new forms

under the direction of U.S. Intelligence agencies. CARIC hopes that

these same concerned citizens will continue to oppose the policies of

our government which bring this new form of covert war and the

Watergate scandals. It is now time for thousands of Americans to

mobilize to stop the spying as we stopped the dying. Please join us in

our effort.

THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:

THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTERS

TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE

Part 1. Introduction

Who Assassinated President Kennedy?

On November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas,

President

John F. Kennedy.

while riding in an open limousine

through Dealej Plaza and waving to the surrounding

crowds,

was shot to death.

Lee Harvey Oswald, an

ex-Marine,

and former visitor to the Soviet Union,

was arrested that afternoon in a movie theatre in

another section of Dallas;

two days of question-

preserved).

Two days later while Oswald was being

transferred from one jail to another,

he was shot

by Jack Ruby, a Dallas night-club

in the

basement of the Dallas police station,

while mil-

lions of Americans watched on television.

The com-

mission of investigation,

appointed by President

Lyndon B.

Johnson, and headed by Chief Justice Earl

Warren of the l.

S.

Supreme Court,

published its

report in September

1964, and concluded that Oswald

was the sole assassin and that there was no conspir-

acy in view of the authority of the Warren Commis-

sion,

that conclusion was accepted by many Americans

for a long time.

But

the conclusion cannot be con-

sidered true by any person who carefully considers

THE PURSUIT OF IMPORTANT TRUTH

The magazine Computers and Automation has for more

than three years followed an unusual publication policy:

- The pursuit of truth in input, output, and pro-

cessing, for the benefit of people,

and an unusual beliet:

- That computers are too important to be left to

computer experts and must be integrated into a

socially responsible profession of information

engineering.

Where this policy has operated most is in publishing

information, articles, and reports on subjects which a

great many liberal and progressive newspapers and peri.

odicals have left unexplored or unmentioned:

- The political conspiracies which have led to the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Sena-

tor Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and

others - and their coverups

- The conspiracies, coverups, and lies in connection

with the pursuit of war in Indochina and dictator-

ship by the Saigon regime

- The connections of President Richard M. Nixon

with organized crime and the Mafia

- The Watergate crimes

If you believe in the value of truthful, frank reporting

on the most important topics for the welfare of the

people of the United States today, we urge you to sub-

scribe to our magazine, and buy our back copies (almost

every one is in print).

Please help us pursue the important

truth and report on it, by buying our products.

Edmund C. Berkeley, Editor

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical

Computers and Automation, established 1951 and

therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-

puters and data processing, believes that the pro

fession of information engineer includes not only

competence in handling information using computers

and other means, but also a broad responsibility.

in a professional and engineering sense, for:

- The reliability and social significance of

pertinent input data;

- The social value and truth of the output

results.

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-

fessional responsibility for the reliability and

significance of

the data he uses, and the safety

and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human

beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes

from time

to

time

articles and other

information

related

to

socially useful input and output of data

systems in a broad sense.

To this end we seek

to

publish what is unsettling,

disturbing,

critical

- but productive of thought and an improved and

safer

"house" for all humanity, an earth in which

our children and lster generations may have a fu-

sure, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engineer needs to

relate his engineering

to the most important and

most

serious problems in the world today:

nuclear weapons.

Polion. the population explo

sion, and many more.

The Understanding of Natural Language by Computers

Proposition: Computers are making long strides towards

understanding natural language as used by human

beings, and will eventually understand such language

as well as many human beings do.

What do we mean by: computers? understanding lan-

guage? natural language? And what is the evidence for this

proposition?

The word "computers" here refers to powerful comput-

ers that have appropriate programs written by human be-

ings plus the programmed capacity to improve their pro-

grams by using experience.

An example of such improve-

ment is Dr. A. L. Samuels' famous checker-playing pro-

gram, which can learn from experience, and which plays

far better checkers than Dr. Samuels himself can play.

The experience may consist of the following at least:

Answers from human beings to questions posed by

the computer;

Differences between computed results and a priori

specified results;

Signals from the environment, such as instrument

readings;

Information obtained by "looks" at the environment,

as for example recognition of the character A, as

in optical character recognition;

The interpretation of words, as with FORTRAN ex-

pressions.

Probably there are even more categories of experience

which a powerful computer program can use to modify it-

self to become even a better program.

In regard to "understanding language", there are over

500 languages which computers have been programmed to

understand, when written precisely according to stated

rules: among them, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, many

kinds of machine language, etc.

"Natural language" is the ordinary language used by hu-

man beings, subject to the requirement that for a computer

implicit understandings must be stated. For example, when

a speaker exclaims "Ouch!", a great deal of the meaning

comes from the listener's observations of the speaker.

But

a computer, like a blind man, cannot "see" the situation,

and must be told more than the ordinary. listener.

With some definitions taken care of, let us consider evi-

dence for the main proposition stated above. This evidence

includes the information published in several recent ar-

ticles in Computers and Automation.

The article ""Do What I Mean' - The Programmer's As-

sistant", by Warren Teitelman, in the April 1972 issue,

described a "programmer's assistant", called "DWIM"; this

was a "front end" or preprocessor to an interactive pro-

gram for operating with LISP expressions. The front end

was tolerant of the programmer's mistakes in typing, in low-

mistake occurred, it would inquire of the human program-

mer what he meant, suggesting the correctly spelled alter-

native, and so on. In this way the human programmer was

relieved of much of the burden of expressing himself ex-

actly and correctly the first time, and his efficiency in

using the LISP interactive program greatly increased

The three articles "Computer Programming Using Natu-

ral Language" by Edmund C. Berkeley, Andy Langer, and

Casper Otten, in the June, July, and August 1973 issues,

demonstrated the understanding by a computer program

called GENIE of at least some sets of instructions in ordi-

nary natural language.

The vocabulary though small was

free; and there was unlimited freedom in putting the words

together, with about a 90% chance of complete under-

standing.

The computer program that did this could be

called 15% GENIE, because, as the authors emphasized, it

was still in an early stage of development.

The article "Latest Computers See, Hear, Speak, and

Sing — and May Outthink Man" by David Brand, in the

October 1973 issue, enumerated many instances of com-

puters (and robots equipped with computers) which could

deal with concepts expressed in natural language. One of

the programs mentioned could for example decipher natu-

ral language commands dealing with the stacking of blocks

of various shapes, sizes, and colors.

The main tasks for understanding natural language ap-

pear to be the following:

Recognition of the framework of a sentence;

Recognition of the common meaning of groups of

synonyms, the collection of words that "say

the same thing"

Knowledge of context: the context is regularly

specilied to the computer, so that it does not

have to deduce the context from "what is being

said";

Knowledge of a limited vocabulary consisting of per-

haps 300 to 500 words - knowledge in the sense

that the computer program can attach meaning to

the words either by themselves or in phrases, as

for example it may attach the meaning of doing

something three times to the numeral 3;

Capacity to accept variation in the way something is

The that articles hefere to above show instances of

the achievement of all of these tasks separately. Combin-

Cooperative Facilities to Obtain

the Advantages of Computers

Michael J. Cerullo

Asst. Professor of Accounting

State Univ. of New York at Albany

1400 Washington Ave.

Albany, N. Y. 12222

"Because of general dissatisfaction, 30% of the surveyed service bureau clients

planned to discontinue using service bureaus."

Computer Use

A recent study of 2,500 companies conducted by

the Research Institute of America, revealed that 55%

of the firms regularly use computers in conducting

their business.

Further breakdown of the study

shows that an average of 32% own or lease their own

computers, and 23% use an outside service bureau for

processing data. l

While a majority of the companies surveyed do use

computers in some form, a significant 45%. of. the re-

spondents do not use any type of computerized data

processing service.

Those companies cited the fol-

lowing reasons for not using computers:2

Service Bureau Use

In addition to the non-users, another recent

study revealed that most service bureau clienss are

not effectively using their service bureau and, as

• result, are receiving few, if any, of the advan-

tages of electronic data processing (EDP).

1. Receiving routine services which do not save

3. Not receiving indirect benefits and savings.

such as improved information for decision

making.

4. Not satisfied with current services.

The study

also disclosed that because of the gen-

eral dissatisfaction,

30% of the surveyed service

bureau clients planned to discontinue using service

bureaus and purchase in-house computers.4

Cooperative Service Bureaus

Both non-users and dissatisfied service bureau

clients,

therefore,

offer a ready market

for a newer

approach to obtaining the advantages of EDP

— the

formation of a cooperative service bureau.

A coop-

erative service bureau consists of several sponsor-

ing firms who jointly own a computer and share in

its operating costs at a much lower expense than in-

dividual ownership of a computer.

If carefully

planned before operations begin, a cooperative ser-

vice bureau will provide its sponsors with all the

advantages of EDP plus many other advantages unique

to jointly-shared facilities and personnel.

Among these additional advantages are:

1. The sponsors would purchase a computer tai-

lored to their specific needs.

2. They would have exclusive use of the computer.

3. Their computer would be available for use a1

any time.

4. They could share the costs of any computer

programs developed.

5. They could share the costs of any package of

canned computer programs purchased.

6. They would have available for their exclusive

use a staff of data processing experts and

a computer - at a fraction of the cost of

individual ownership.

one reason for the lack of inter-

est is a misunderstanding of the true nature of a

cooperative.

Interested companies must therefore be

prepared to sell the idea to others.

As more pub-

lished material becomes available in the field,

problem

this

should be alleviated.

Confidential Information

A second major reason for lack of interest is

that companies fear for the

control and security of

their confidential or sensitive information.

Such a

concern is certainly legitimate and underscores the

meed for a cooperative that is to be successful, to

devise an adequate system for quality control and

security.

A committee

responsible for such a system

should be established at the outset by the sponsor-

Ing firms.

One of its duties should be to adequately safe-

records and documents against

fire, theft,

and other hazards and disasters.

Statistics compiled by the Safe Manufacturers Na-

Plenal Association show that about one-half of com-

panies whose important records and documents were

destroyed through some catastrophe never resumed

business or were permanently closed down within six

months: an additional 13% suffered serious economic

Impairment and were able to remain in business only

the quality control and security committee must see

The committee must also take measures to prevent

mother client's records - a not-unlikely occurrence

Ie such an environment.

Preventing Disclosure

Finally, the committee should determine how to

prevent disclosure of confidential ipformation. For

chample, no member of any sponsoring company should

hey computer center personnel. In cases requiring

#IB088 security, the actual processing of data

should be monitored by a key employee of the com-

pater center or possibly by a representative of a

disinterested third party, such as a firm of inde-

pendent public accountants.

Sharing of Expenses: Startup Costs

With an adequate number of sponsoring firms lined

up and a sound security system worked out. the third

necessity in establishing a successful cooperative

is to determine methods of sharing the expenses.

There are two categories of costs to consider:

1. Startup costs.

These include all costs incur-

red prior to the time that the cooperative commences

operations. Startup costs are either directly

traceable to a particular firm or are joint or com-

mon to all firms.

An example of a direct cost would

be that of analyzing, modifying, and redesigning of

systems prior to conversion to the computer. An ex-

ample of a joint or common cost would be the cost of

computer housing, including air conditioning, engi-

neering supervision, false floors, ducts and pipes,

tranformers or motor generators, cabling and wiring.

and overhead racks and supports.

Each sponsoring firm should pay for its own di-

rect costs.

Joint costs should be shared equally or

apportioned among the firms according to some equi-

table formula.

Operating Costs

2. Operating

costs.

These include the monthly

hardware and software costs to operate the coopera-

tive.

Hardware costs refer to the periodic rental

or purchase charge

for the computer equipment. As a

minimum the computer equipment consists of an input

unit, a central

processing unit,

and an output unit.

Software costs include personnel costs, programming

costs.

testing and debugging costs, magnetic tapes.

dise packs, punched cards,

paper,

paper tapes";

pair parts, power, telecommunication lines,

and so

on.

Operating costs

that are directly traceable

should be paid by the using firm.

Joint or common

costs can be shared equally or can be allocated

each firm based on

the number of transactions pro-

cessed or

the

actual computer processing time used

during the period.

In addition,

if so desired,

sponsor could be required to pay a minimum or maxi-

mum monthly charge.

Management

Fourthly, the sponsóring companies should decide

how to manage the venture.

It is advisable to form

a committee to oversee the management and operation

of the cooperative.

A decision must be made whether

each member regardless of size

should have one vote

or whether another basis of voting

should be used.

This decision should assure participants that

firm will dominate or control the cooperative.

Control in Time-Sharing Systems

*A time-sharing installation (like every computer environment) is exposed to the seven major

dangers: fire, water, theft, fraud, sabotage, equipment malfunctions, and human errors."

Introduction

This article has as its main objective to furnish

and define some methods and

provisions for control

and security in a computer time-sharing environment.

It is evident that computer time-sharing has be-

come very popular during recent years.

More and

more confidential information is being handled by

these systems, creating an urgent need for strong

measures of control and security.

Description of the System

The service provided by a single computer to many

telecommunications

terminals has

been called "com-

puter time-sharing".

With this type of service each

user shares simultaneously in the processing capa-

bilities of the central processor.

This new com

puter facility makes this service available

to small

companies and/or other users who have little need

for their own computer.

Computing services that may go under the heading

of time-sharing include:

Commercial computing; text editing; databank

information retrieval services; application

services such as colleges'

records,

inventor

control, payrolls of small companies,

and ac-

count receivables; administrative messages:

switching and collection services;

and

more.

Among the great number of time-sharing users are

hospitals (Welch Hospital,

one of the biggest in

Europe,

has acquired

bank of the

USSR, has ordered two large-scale Honey-

well series 600 with 100 terminals),

schools and

colleges (British schools and colleges have started

using terminals),

airlines (Continental Airlines

line terminals).

Jerry Dreyer, executive president of ADAPSO, a

issociation of data processing service organization

estimates that one time-sharing company out of three

was profitable in

1971,

two out

of five in 1972,

and

probably three out of six in 1973.

Nowadays,

this

computer facility

is coming back to its original

trend, and it is expected that the number of com-

puters with terminals will grow

from

1 32% at the end

of 1971 to 45% at the end of 1975,

with the average

central processing unit driving 15 to 20 terminals.

One consultant, Creative Strategies of falo Alto,

California, predicts that time-sharing

sales by 1976

will increase to 2 billion from 331 million last

year.

By 1975,

says ADAPSO's Dreyer,

time-sharing

will account for 1/3 of the $4.5 billion computer

services

industry.

Technological Advances

Nost important technological advances have been

achieved recently on on-line terminals linked to

central processors.

provide faster,

tions; improved lower cost memories; more powerful

logic capability; and faster and more accurate

and improvements in central proc-

essor software.

This is only the beginning.

The quality and level of protection required de-

pends on the sensitivity of the data handled.

Never-

theless, control and security in a time-sharing en-

vironment should encompass the whole system, since

it is well known that even the strongest control

measures can be violated at the weakest point. These

measures should be taken in the central processing

unit, software, personnel, communication lines, the

terminal, and its users.

Methods and Provisions -

Central Processing Unit

The central processor is threatened mostly by

sabotage, fire, water, theft, EDP equipment mal-

functions, human accidental errors and environmen-

tal problems.

The computer center of any company is the heart

of the organization, and protection of the equip-

ment against these threats can be provided by a

carefully planned computer room. Luis Scoma, Presi-

lent of Data Processing Security; Inc., recommends

that the computer center be located out of the mair

traffic areas. It must be fireproof, dustfree, and

waterproof and provided with temperature and humid-

ity control and carbon dioxide fire extinguishers.

Water lines should not run through the computer

ete.), well-performed maintenance service, and a

number of extra provisions for protection.

Data Processing Security, Inc. has developed, for

high security necessities,

an electronically oper-

ated double door entry system for access control in-

to the computer room.

When a person enters the buf-

fer zone, the door locks behind him while he is sub-

jected to electronic search.

If something is de-

tected, the system freezes and automatically alerts

the security guard.

The second door can be opened

only with a special badge key.

Software

Protection of data files, whether in the form of

punch cards, magnetic tapes,

or discs, is the key

element in any computer facility.

Some specific examples of software security con-

trol measures are audit trails, access regulations,

strong supervision of computer

operators,

the use

and control of programs utilizing

program documen-

tation methods,

the use of a log for all significant

events (such as user identification,

file use and

attempts of unauthorized use), regulations

to pre-

vent

unauthorized personnel from browsing

through

the files, and the use of a semi-automatic data in-

ventory control system.

Personnel

Intimately involved with time-

sharing installations are three types of personnel:

operators, programmers, and maintenance engineers.

According to Dennis Van Tassel,

mathematician and

head programmer at San Jose State College,

all oper-

ators

must understand that there exists a protection

philosophy.

If personnel are expected to help en-

force and to comply with this protection

philosophy,

it

must be clearly defined and specified.

It is advisable to use the following provisions

for personnel control:

control of logs and monitor,

division of responsibilities,

rotation of duties,

adequate supervision to reduce the risk of losses

caused by accident

or error,

careful handling

of

data files,

cleanliness regulations,

control access

to private

files, and appropriate instruction in

case of disasters.

Terminals

Some of the most common pitfalls encountered

when using

terminals are frequent communication in

terruptions, risk of communication interception,

difficult access control, and noisy lines.

Among the greatest disadvantages of time-sharing

those in connection with the communi-

cation lines which link the terminals to the central

transmission system which

delphia, Washington, and Chicago); and, by the end

of 1974, twenty-four cities are expected 10 have it.

sion on retransmission will be the customer's re-

sponsibility.

Another development in data communi-

cation is DUV (data under voice). By late 1973 this

technique will be in service between New York and

Chicago; consequently, communication problems should

become virtually nonexistent within the near future,

and this system will become even more popular.

Telephone lines are vulnerable to three types of

security problems: wire tapping, piggyback, and

user's sign-off signal cancellation.

These common

threats may be avoided by the use of a privacy

transformation method (also called scramblers or

cryptographic techniques). This is a non-singular

(reversible) operation which conceals the original

message either by the substitution of new characters,

rearrangement of the characters, or by the adding of

strings of digits to the original message.

Some new techniques for encrypting data have

evolved, such as high speed transmission and signal

scrambling.

In spite of all of these new tech

niques, It is still possible to intercept and tap

the information.

According to Tuckerman, unauthor-

ized users (intruders) who possess only limited ma-

terial and information with which to work, can read-

ily extract the original text of enciphered mes-

sages by making use of the speed, capacity, and

computational abilities of the computer.

The greater the efficiency of the privacy trans.

formation, the more difficult it becomes for unauth-

orized copying of files.

Access Control

Access to the system throughout the communication

lines should be controlled by the central processing

unit and by the user's own procedures.

This is pos-

sible by cryptographic and scramble techniques, per-

sonnel regulations.

user identification,

appropriate

terminal location, or by ciphering and deciphering

hardware.

Computer software packages have been written to

cipher data transmissions.

Ciphering software is

an attractive technique because it can be done auto-

matically by the program which creates the data and

at a very low cost.

Only programs using the match-

ing deciphering technique are able to use this data.

These special hardware cipher devices can be located

at the terminal and at the computer to protect

transmitted data.

Scramblers or voice privacy devices are currently

being used by people who readily acknowledge the in-

security of transmitted information.

Scramblers are

used by large corporations such as the oil indusiry

as well as by union representatives during contract

negotiation time.

(Scramble phones are currently a

20 to 30 million-dollar business, excluding law en-

forcement and military purchases).

Scramble devices

are now being built for time-sharing operations.

These devices offer protection similar to encryption.

Scramblers convert data into something resembling

channel noise or a malfunctioning circuit.

Other features for terminals, include print in-

hibit, security keylock, operator identification

card reader, and the use of a terminal identifier.

This switch provides additional pro-

leniles for read only volumes.

Insurance

If data security measures fail, the use of EDP

anorance can back-up or soften the blow.

Every

serases or is a user of a service bureau, or trans-

ails data lo a data center should be computer-secur-

Insurance is one of the back-up

if prevention fails.

However,

not all

roslaras can afford or even

need an elaborate and

espensive security system; thus,

evaluation of the

ratormation becomes necessary to determine those

Procedure for Withdrawal

Sixth, a procedure should be established for

withdrawal from the cooperative.

If the withdraw-

ing firm has not been a member for a predetermined

time, perhaps one or two years,

a sliding scale

penalty fee for withdrawal should be established.

Procedure for Admission

Finally,

procedures must be determined to govern

the admission of new members into the cooperative.

Perhaps a unanimous affirmative vote by

current men-

bers should be required to admit a new member.

The

current members should also decide if a newly admit-

ted member should be required to pay a predetermined

portion of the cooperative's startup costs and if

the cooperative should limit membership to firms of

the same approximate size as current members.

Conclusion

With due care taken in following

the above steps.

establishing a successful cooperative service bureau

should be relatively easy.

Companies would be well

advised to consider the idea seriously, for cooper-

ative service bureaus offer a viable and in many ways su-

perior alternative to the more costly inhouse computer

and the less satisfactory outside service bureau.

"Systems analysts... must be seen as full-fledged members of the firm."

A Wall of Managerial Attitudes

In most large organizations.

the systems and data

processing departments are separated from the rest

of the firm by a wall of managerial attitudes.

While

employees in most jobs are

variety

encouraged to gain a wide

of experience in various departments as they

rise through various management levels,

it is rare

that a systens analyst or a programmer is given an

equal opportunity.

The general attitude is "He's a

computer man, not a manager (or a businessman,

or a

banker).

He wouldn't fit in.

Besides.

he's doing a

good job where he is."

As a result,

the analyst has exactly no motiva-

tion to think of himself as an insurance man or a

businessman,

or a banker,

or an accountant.

He is

made to feel like a consultant.

He can serve the

organization,

but he isn't free to move within it.

To make matters worse, some firms rotate the people

their management development programs through a

stint in the systems department.

It is little won-

der that there is a high turnover in systems ana-

lysts.

The company does very little to make him

feel like a member of the family.

Potential Source of Talent

But beyond the problems brought about by the per

sonnel turbulence, the firm is ignoring a potentia

source of fine managerial talent. Many analysts

joining major corporations hold degrees as Master.

Business Administration.

Their educational back.

grounds, when combined with their ability to objec-

Lively define problems and see solutions, and the

detailed working knowledge of the company gained in

the system design process, should put them in the

management spotlight.

Instead, the system analyst

finds that he has

been given the indelible label of

"computer person" and that his upward mobility is

• limited to the systems department.

As a result,

systems analysts leave the firm, and often leave the

systems profession.

If companies hope to attract and hold talented

personnel for their systems activities, they need

to offer them an equal chance to develop

to their

full potential.

They must be seen as full-fledged

members of the firm - not as consultants who are

here today, but who could move on tomorrow.

Experience in Systems

As businesses come more and more to depend upon

data processing to

support their operations,

it

will be desirable for a significant number of man-

agement team members to have experience in systems.

Yet,

by

their actions.

managements have forced many

talented people to avoid beginning their careers in

data processing for fear of becoming stereotyped.

So it would seem that a number of the problems

that businesses face in their systems activities are

a result of a regrettable but widesprgad management

attitude.

Only when systems analysts are regarded as having

a potential for advancement to positions in general

management, and are given an equal chance to rise in

the organization, will the systems man lose his al-

lenation and see himself as a member of the company

team.

Complexity

These differences of opinion, and these disloca-

of the problem. Who among us can honestly say he

other governmental and community. levels.

Facing these and still other complexities, we

going beyond this,

we must be prepared to discuss

lawmakers the more important question

what do all

these statistics and contentions mean to, me?

The Concerns of U.S. Citizens

The concerns of the great body of United States

citizens are how to assure and enhance their jobs

and living conditions and be involved in what was

once unashamedly described as "the pursuit of hap-

piness".

Let's look at just one major concern: about 1.3

million new American families are formed every year.

Approximately eight

million people change their jobs

every year.

About 3.7 million people Join the labor

force and 2.1 million leave it.

By

1980 full em-

ployment in the United States will require jobs for

100 million people, 18 million more than were em-

ployed at the end of 1972.

These, quite clearly,

are

the priority considerations in the minds of mil-

lions who do not clearly understand how the enter-

prise system meets their needs.

If they

and the representatives of large numbers

of voters do not understand, how can we expect their

support?

I would like to review the arguments for their

support in as familiar terms'as I can muster.

The Days of U.S. Preeminence are Gone

First, let's examine one portion of the real

economic world we inhabit.

Of primary importance is the fact that the days

of almost total U.S. preeminence since the close of

World War II are gone.

We must learn to live and work in a world where

forevermore we will be dependent on other portions

of the globe for some of our more

tle corner of the world,

and we must find a way to

live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of

I hesitate,

somewhat,

to use the energy crisis as

an example of this dependency,

because

that

there are those who

recognize

really exists.

or who maintain that

new technology

will solve

the problem before it reaches crisis

stage.

I can say at this point

that there is an

energy shortage, if not a crisis;

for example,

the

fuel

oil allotment for our Minneapolis operations

has been cut by 25 per cent for January and February,

and similar cutbacks have been imposed on other com-

panies,

our schools, our common carriers.

Let's look at the dependency which is developing

in the oil industry.

In the past,

the repatriated

earnings of oil companies have exceeded the value of

imported oil and were a favorable factor in our in-

ternational balance of payments.

By

1985, however,

our needs for oil and natural gas could create for

us a trade deficit approaching twenty billion dol-

lars a year.

As no doubt you know, we currently import 1O to

15 per cent of both crude oil and copper.

our bauxite needs. • We must import all or most of

our tin, natural rubber, nickel and chrome.

We cannot go it alone. We must trade with the

- and to trade, you give something to get

something, with the hope that both traders get what

they want and need.

Unfortunately, we have not yet

been able to fully realize this goal, and much of

the controversy over this nation's foreign-trade

policies revolves around the best way to achieve it.

There is a strong and vocal body of opinion whic

elieves that protectionist measures wil

achieve

what is best for American workers and companies in

the arena of world trade.

One of their principal

targets are companies like Honeywell

- multina-

tional companies with substantial investments, em

ployees and sales outside the United States.

"Exporting Jobs"?

It is claimed that U.S.

multinational corpora-

tions are

"exporting jobs"

overseas; that U.s.

com-

panies invest overseas to take advantage of lower

wages: that imports from the overseas subsidiaries

of U.s.

companies cause unemployment here at home:

that if U.S.

companies were prevented from investing

and manufacturing abroad these companies would be

forced to expand their operations in the United

States, creating more jobs here: that multinational

companies invest abroad in order to avoid paying

taxes:

that American corporations are exporting U.S.

technology and

therefore are helping non-u.s.

com-

panies compete in our own and other countries.

The Burke-Hartke bill has been proposed as the

solution to these problems; and protectionist senti-

ment also underlies other proposals which may emerge

for the consideration of Congress.

At this point,

there may be those who will accuse

me of making a tactical blunder by

even mentioning

the allegations of our critics.

But I'll go

one

step further.

If someone could prove to me

that

these allegations

are factual.

I'd be

one of the

major supporters of moves to inhibit the growth of

multinational companies.

The Opposite is True: Making Jobs

Thanks to various companies, government agencies

and trade associations who have accumulated the

facts and

published them, I know otherwise.

I am

convinced,

thanks to these studies, and my

experience with Honeywell, that multinational com-

panies do not export jobs, but create jobs in the

United States faster

than other u.S.

companies.

International Investment Activities

of Multinational Companies

lead to one major conclusion:

That the interna-

tional investment activities of these representative

multinational companies played an important role in

their rapid export growth and consequently made a

major positive contribution to their domestic

I emphasize the word domestic - sales, investment

and employment growth.

Double Taxation

I have tried to speak in familiar language; so I

have some misgivings about discussing the issue of

Talke it d

But

the tax issue

is an important

one,

and

I'd like to cover some specific areas which are com-

ing more and more into public discussion.

Af issue is the section of U.S. tax law which al-

dows American corporations a tax credit for the in-

come taxes they pay to foreign countries on income

earned in such

countries.

The purpose of this tax

credit is to avoid taxing the foreign

earnings of

U.S. corporations twice

- once in a foreign

and again when

country

the earnings are remitted to the

United States.

Opponents of this tax credit argue that since do-

mestic firms are not allowed a federal tax credit

for

the state taxes

they

pay.

the current method of

taxing income from foreign sources is inconsistent

with the way domestic income is taxed.

Taxation by U.S. States

A major fallacy in this argument is that it is

based on the incorrect assumption that the taxation

of domestic income by city,

state and the federal

government is analogous

to the United

States taxing

the foreign earnings of American subsidiaries which

have already been taxed by

the

host country.

The proper analogy is between the way

states

treat

corporate income earned in two or more states

and the way

the U.S.

government treats income earned

in two or more countries.

Every

state which has a

seate income tax provides a method of allocating the

income of a multi-state company among the various

states in order to avoid duplicate taxation of the

sane income.

As

a matter of fact,

the

constitution

requires this.

Thus the current methods of taxing

foreign and domestic income are consistent.

taxed at full U.S. income tax rates?

International Competition by

American Industry

Another fundamental element of the issue is the

tax credit's relationship to the ability of American

industry to compete internationally.

According to a

recent survey by the National Association of Manufac-

turers, if the United States were to repeal the tax

credit for foreign taxes paid and tax all foreigr

ations would be forced to pay an average effective

tax on their foreign earnings of over

TO per cent.

Given this added tax handicap.

few American firms

could continue to compete with foreign-controlled

companies for world markets.

You can appreciate how useful it is to have these

facts for presentation where contradictory allega-

tions are being made.

Let's keep the record straight!

Also useful to the undertaking on which we must

all embark is the factual story of what imports and

exports do, beneficially to create jobs.

Imports Produce One Million U.s. Jobs

Labor Department figures document

the finding

that one million jobs in the United States are de-

pendent on imports - jobs for food processors, ship

and dock workers, truck drivers and railroaders,

warehouse employees and retail clerks.

And it's

equally impressive to corsider that every

billion

dollars worth of exports creates 60-t0-80,000 jobs

in the United States.

As we assess the situation, let us not forget the

dilemma our government faced in August 1971.

As

Mr. Peter

Peterson wrote,

the New Economic Policy

announced that month was not,

and I quote,

"a one-

shot reaction to a one-time crisis.

It marked the

beginning

of a new era of more flexible.

enduring.

and viable economic relationships among nations.

The

years behind us were by and large an era of success.

but an era based upon a system which had become ou-

grown, outworn - and increasingly crisis-prone."

Tariffs and Free Trade

Mr. Peterson was referring to the tremendous in-

pact that international

trade and monetary

factors

were having

on our people.

We have since

learn the difficulty of achieving universally ap-

proved corrective action.

And now we must reckon

with this

reality: U.S. negotiators are preparing

to enter economic talks next fall that could shape

future international relationships for many years to

come.

Our government can and should strive in these

talks to put an end to present attitudes and trends

that point ominously to another "balkanization" of

world trade.

It can and should seek agreement to reduce.

and

if possible end,

all tariffs on industrial trade by

the end of this century.

It can and should try to create far freer trade

conditions for farm products.

It can and should seek the harmonization among

nations of the present hodgepodge of non-tariff

trade barriers and preferences.

But these objectives will remain forlorn hopes

unless our negotiators can go into these hard bar-

gaining sessions with the clear backing of the Amer-

ican people and their Congress. He must give them

that.

Since the turn of the century, such

Further, the concept of pattern

ample evidence.of this concept throughout art his-

A few such examples are:

such a degree.

the human questions arising from computer use.".

In "The Computer and the Poet," Norman Cousins

emphasizes that the role of poets.

"those

who have

respect for and speak to the human spirit,"

Science fiction writers should indeed be included as

poets in our technological age.

All too often in

our society,

problems arising from technology

are

left to technologists because others are too unsure

of their own knowledge to question or criticize.

The

science fiction writings directly involving comput-

ers are one of the few places where non-specialists

attempt to involve other non-specialists in the

human questions arising from computer use.

Emphasis on Man

Perhaps the most recurrent science fiction theme

is the difference between computers and man.

These

raise the question of the proper role for machines

versus the proper role for humans or emphasize the

aspects that make man unique.

In one story

(Asimov,

"Someday") children in a society where reading and

writing are no longer needed

form a secret society

to learn just for the joy of it;

in another (Weir.

"What Happened to the Teaching Machine") where all

learning is by machine,

only uneducated children

still know how to pose questions.

A super-computer

is defeated by a human because he can bluff or

"lose

to win" and it cannot (Caiden.

The God Machine);

another super-computer is robbed of its control be-

cause of a

group of humans whose main desire is

freedom (Pohl,

Starchild);

and to others (Dick.

"The

Variable Man": Sheckley,

"Fool's Mate") human unpre-

dictability continues to be a problem. This distine-

tive aspect of man is very directly stated by the

computer builder in a French science fiction story

(Boulie,

"The Perfect Robot"). In trying to make

the computer more like man, he progressively adds to

Its ability to deal with data, the ability to play

hess, language, concepts of love, the ability to

engender new machines, concepts of good and evil.

Mechanistic View of Man

We diminish man and in our anxiety grow more dis-

dainful of ourselves and ambivalent towards

comput-

ers if computer usage is predicated on a mechanistic

view of man and this mechanistic view becomes our

self-image.

Too many statements made by

scientists display that a com-

is being

substituted for

Keep in mind the above list of human

attributes contrasted to computers by

science-fic-

tion writers as you read the following statement

from the widely read and much discussed book Limits

Yet,

despite the model's mater-

lal orientation, the conclusions of the study

point to

the need for fundamental

changes in

the values of society.

(34, p. 191)

Admission that the world model has a minor flaw of

omitting "critical social factors"

followed so

blithely by conclusions about fundamental value

changes surely conveys to the reader that the fac-

tors that have been dealt with are the more essen-

tial and more significant.

in an article by Weizenbaum.

What is the effect of this situation on individuals

and

on society?

Two side effects are discussed by

Weizenbaum.

First of course, there is the psychological

impact on individuals living in a society in

which anonymous, hence irresponsible, forces

The reader may argue the degree to which these

side effects are already present in our society,

if he reads sicence-fiction, he cannot ignore them.

'A fabulous gift for Christmas:

"RIDE THE EAST WIND: Parables of Yesterday and Today"

by Edmund C. Berkeley, Author and Anthologist

Over fifty parables (including anecdotes, allegories, and fables) by Berkeley and many other

authors, modern and ancient, dealing with famous problems, modern, classic, or ageless. Many

parables are decorated by a bouquet of proverbs and quotations - for readers who like to

choose which variety of lesson appeals to them. A short guide to some patches of common

sense and wisdom. An ideal gift.

Illustrated. Hard cover. 224 pages.

Do you remember the story of the fox

and the grapes? illustrating a principle o

such timeless value that the phrase "sou

grapes" has been used and understood by

millions of people for 2000 years?

Well, why not make a collection of

ideas and principles of common sense and

wisdom - and why not illustrate them

with fables, allegories, and anecdotes of

enormous impact?

That was the plan of this book.

It comes right out of our work on the

*Notebook on Common Sense and Wisdom,

Elementary and Advanced® - which we

have been talking about for two years to

anyone who would listen.

Some of the issues of the Notebook

roused the interest of the president of

Quadrangle Books - and this book is one

of the results.

You can't lose by taking a look at

this book:

• You might enjoy it.

• You might find much of it

humorous and imaginative -

as did Aesop's listeners.

• You might find it instructive,

philosophical, worth thinking

about, and more besides.

You can see it, read it, keep it for

7 days, return it, and back comes th

full price of the book

How can you lose?

We want only satisfied customers.

The Fox of Mt. Etna and the Grapes

Once there was a Fox who lived on the lower slopes of

Mit. Etna, the great volcano in Sicily.

These slopes are ex-

tremely fertile; the grapes that grow there may well be the

most delicious in the world; and of all the farmers there,

Farmer Mario was probably the best. And this Fox longed

and longed for some of Farmer Mario's grapes.

But they

grew very high on arbors, and all the arbors were inside a

vineyard with high wails, and the Fox had a problem.

Of

course, the Fox of Mt Etna had utterly no use for his fam-

ous ancestor, who leaping for grapes that he could not reach,

called them sour, and went away.

The Fox decided that what he needed was Engineering

Technology. So he went to a retired Engineer who lived on

the slopes of Mt. Etna, because he liked the balmy climate

and the view of the Mediterranean Sea and the excitement of

watching his instruments that measured the degree of sieep

ing or waking of Mt. Etna.

The Fox put his problem be-

fore the Engineer.

EDITORIAL

(an updated version of an editorial first printed May 1973)

Burying Facts and Rewriting History - Il

One of the efforts of this magazine is to pursue truth.

One of the ways in which truth is pursued is not to let

statements of the utmost importance be buried and for-

lotten in the pages of daily newspapers, nor unreported

and lost because they are no longer well covered in nation-

al news magazines.

Among those statements are two of permanent interest

in connection with the Watergate Caper (this phrase is es-

tablishmentese for "the Watergate Crime").

- The statement by Bernard L. Barker, one of the con-

victed operatives, which explains his motivation

and background (see November 1972, Computers

and Automation).

- The statement by Alfred Baldwin, 3rd, ex-FBI agent,

an employee of the Republican Committee to Re-

elect the President, telling what he did and saw

while five men burglarized the Watergate offices

of the Democratic National Committee on June

17, 1972, about 2:30 a.m. (see December 1972,

C&A).

In addition, we have published seven installments of re-

ports on the Watergate Crime by our contributing editor,

Richard E. Sprague (a computer professional of 25 years

standing) who as an avocation has studied for many years

dirty political operations in the United States, including

the assassinations by conspiracies (not "lone assassins") of

President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and

Reverend Martin Luther King.

Three years ago in May 1970, when we began to pub-

lish this type of article, we could not have spoken confi-

dently of "the assassination by conspiracies" of two

Kennedys and one King.

But the articles we have pub-

lished - which are listed and characterized on the follow-

ing pages - have together a remarkable impact.

Taken together, the information published May 1970 to

October 1973 in Computers and Automation effectively

destroys a large segment of the beliefs, the rewritten his-

tory, that the establishment in the United States has

arranged for people in the United States to believe. I do

not assert that the establishment is a conscious organism

or organization; perhaps the best description is this: a

loose confederation of overt conspiracies, silent conspir-

acies, and biased wealthy persons, with very intelligent

orchestration stemming from the Pentagon, the Central

Intelligence Agency and the Presidency, and with assists

from organized crime and the Mafia.

We challenge any fairminded person to read this col-

may be ordered from us), and after reading them, to still

believe that the assassinations are actually the actions of

"lone psychopaths," instead of fitting together into a plan

to install a certain kind of autocracy in the United States.

This kind of autocracy claims to be democratic, to

stand up for "national security," "executive privilege,"

"separation of Constitutional powers," etc. It offers ap-

pearances of democracy, but it seizes the realities of

money and power. It cuts programs of social benefit; but

it allocates $80 billion a year to be paid to the military-

industrial-Pentagon complex.

In the 1940's there was a name for this kind of autoc-

racy. Its name was "fascism," effectively a dictatorship

in the interests of big business. What is now appearing in

the U.S. is "fascism" in the form of a dictatorship by the

military industrial complex.

Here in a nutshell is an example of the present uneven

contest: it takes the form of two sentences in a report by

E. Drake Lundell, Jr., in Computerworld for April 22,

1973:

• The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department

is "outmanned and outgunned" when it comes to

prosecuting cases like the current action against IBM,

Senate investigators were told last week.

• In addition, witnesses before the Senate Antitrust

and Monopoly Subcommittee stated that often the

division cannot do its job properly because of polit-

ical pressure from the White House.

These two statements contain a world of implications.

Essentially, the Department of the United States Gov-

ernment which is charged with enforcing certain U.S. laws

against monopoly, can no longer properly function because

of (1) the enormous power of just one business, IBM, and

(2) political pressure from the White House (this phrase is

establishmentese for "President Richard M. Nixon").

We must dig up facts, remember them, and write

the announcement - and thus does not actually

Is art perceptual,

Virtue, in Spite of Erroneous Conceptions

d. P. Frankel

Dean of the Faculty

Harvey Mudd College

Ceremont, Calit. 91711

We think of knowledge as knowing how-to-do-it,

wisdom as knowing whether-to-do-it,

and virtue (if the answer is yes) as doing-it."

In this article. I mean virtue in a much narrower

sense than the theologians, and I mean erroneous con-

ceptions

In a much broader sense than planners of

parenthood.

Let me first speak of virtue.

We think of knowledge as knowing how-to-do-it,

wisdom as knowing

whether-to-do-it,

and virtue as

doing it.

In this sense,

at least in the universi

ties,

we think of scientists as knowing.

the human-

ists as wise,

and the engineers and other techni

cians (doctors, nurses,

social workers and the like)

as virtuous, that is,

the do-ers.

The World is Full of Problems

Now the world is full of problems where we need to

know how to do it,

whether to do it,

and (if the an-

swer is yes) to do it.

Each of us can make his own

list of

pressing social problems: pollution,

limitation, or population growth.

Fortunately we

are

reasonably well supplied with scientists.

humanists,

and technicians.

To understand why we still have

these urgent problems, let us turn to erroneous con-

ceptions.

The erroneous conceptions I wish to deal with

here are:

That it is within the power of scientists and

engineers to choose to work only on projects

"In the public interest," and

That the market place is where one discovers

the public interest.

Choice of Projects to Work on

critics seem to assume that scientists and engi

meers are free to choose their projects,

and complain

that they fail to consider the real public interest.

Scientists may be free to choose their work, but they

1072, at the University of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y.

have no more

to say about how their discoveries are

used than Christopher Columbus did.

As for the engineers, they have more to say about

the uses of science.

since they are the ones who

choose which of science's ideas will be applied, but

they in turn have almost no way, at present, "of iden-

tifying

the public interest, and even less in determ-

ining which products or processes should be produced

to serve it.

A Moratorium on Science?

We will return to this matter of choice, but first

let's eliminate from the list of reasonable alterna-

tives facing

society,

the silly and dangerous notion

of a moratorium on science.

The key notion in the moratorium idea is that if

There

wE are

urged,

don't do any more

science until

(presumably) the humanists devise suitable controls.

The trouble with this kind of conceptual contracep-

tion is two-fold.

In the first place,

as Paul Salt-

man has pointed out eloquently, you can'? forbid

knowing any more than you can forbid writing

poetry.

Science can be slowed down, of course, by driving it

underground, but even if we slowed it way

down,

there

is no evidence that we have either knowledge or wis-

dom enough to control its application, unless we

change some of our habits.

Ignorance and Fear Lead to Irrationality

One habit that needs correction has to do with the

thinking and feeling processes of the humanists

the philosophers, if you will - who presumably are

to show us how to behave. Too often they are igno

rant or fearful of science and engineering.

what one

is ignorant or fearful of, he cannot deal with in a

rational way.

There is no possibility that we can

learn to control what we do by some non-rational

process, such as satori, using mystically-fashioned

playing cards, etc. Control over what we do will

Before that,

Jater.

let us return to the notion that engi-

meers choose what they will work on.

The Choices of Engineers

Most engineers do not make cosmic choices.

They

do not decide that this product will be built and

that one won't be.

Practically all engineers,

I suS-

pect, work for other engineers,

who work for others,

who work in companies where the products are deter-

mined not by science or philosophy, but by

analysis.

market

Now market analysis has come a long way

since the days of the Edsel, and it often guesses

mmopurately,

although not always so,

what the public

I interested in buying.

But what the public buys is

not necessarily what it needs.

The Market-Place Guessing Game

We buy those things that are offered for sale

that are better (in some vague way) than the alter.

matives available to us.

Except for advertising or

other ways of influencing public opinion, the basic

mechani sin of the market pla sells quest does fig-

and push a

little harder.

If this one does not sell,

retrench

a little,

or gamble on another change - and so on.

Advertising and public opinion do play important

roles - how else explain so many different labels

on the same bar of soap,

the same automobile? -

but the decision as to how the engineers' skills

will be used has,

in the past.

been largely deter-

mined by the instantaneous outcome of the market

game.

Major Civil Problems

Now please do not misunderstand me.

The market-

place mechanisms are important for determining soap

or automobile styles.

I believe that criteria of

risk-and-return of investment are elements of

our

decision-making processes that we could discard only

at great peril to our society.

What I an saying is

that

the major civil problems: pollution, poverty,

and population density,

for examples, are not likely

to be defined by market analysis.

These problems, for which acceptable solutions

are needed, share

these characteristics:

First, they cross product classification lines,

and involve more than one sector of the economy.

They are not just problems of the auto industry, or

or manufacturing-bur-not-

service-industries . they involve all of these.

All the skills that all these sectors employ may

have to be applied to these problems.

plants in the country and the transport companies in

the city have pollution problems that differ only in

To expect them to do the necessary research

and development. separately,

each with his eye on his

own segment of the market, is to postpone until

if not forever, salving even the

smaller parts of our problems. The problems, so to

speak, are too big.

These Problems are Hardly Separable

In the same way, the major civil problems are not

readily separable.

One can reduce the amount of sir

using electric autos,

for example.

If so.

we may

replace polluted air in the cities with polluted

streams out in the country where the new massive

power plants are.

Or we can replace with solar

energy the

fissionable materials or

fossil fuels we

now use for power; however,

at least in the near

future,

we would then have either much less energy

or much more costly energy, and fewer jobs and more

poverty.

even blacker

pictures.

They point out that our society gave up

only when our technology developed to the

point where machines were cheaper than slaves.

Is

it possible that we could deliberately reverse this

process and end up with clean air, but with slaves?)

This characteristic of tight linkage, or insep-

arability of the big problems.

also suggests that

we cannot rely upon

anisms

the ordinary market-place mech-

to determine how we employ our technology to

solve our problems.

Very Difficult Problems

The third characteristic of our problems that

forces us to reconsider the mechanisms of choice.

is that our problems are so very difficult.

The

technical solutions do not exist outside of social

considerations.

The social costs outweigh

such us-

ual factor costs as materials,

labor,

and capital.

Our cities present much tougher problems than put-

Since they will operate on

about three-and-a-half million dollars a year (the

Nixon and the Mafia - Conclusion

"Organized crime will put a man in the White House someday, and he won't

further

information about

the relation of

President-tO-be Richard M. Nixon with shady trans-

actions in the Bahamas.

Shakeup in the Bahamas

By the middle Sixties there was a storm brewing.

Internal friction had forced out a few people like

Lou Chesler,

while a wave of public investigations

were blaring the role of underworld figures like

Meyer Lansky.

The 1967 Royal Commission of Inquiry

also dredged up another familiar name - Richard

Nixon.

• Courteney, a Lansky lieutenant, detailed a long

bookmaking career and brought out the names of a

large clientele.

including the then ex-Vice Presi-

dent Richard Nixon.

Mary Carter Paint

The Royal Commission also bared a deal which im-

plicated Richard Nixon far more deeply than passing

mention by an underground bookie.

In 1967 Lyndon Pindling

became the first black

premier ever to serve the almost one hundred percent

black citizenry of the island.

Pindling was hardly

a revolutionary,

however, for among the people in-

strumental in putting

him in office was a gambler

close to Lansky

named Mike McLaney.

The Royal Com-

mission branded McLaney a "thoroughly dangerous per-

son"

and accused him of maneuvering Pindling into at

least one deal involving a questionable gambling

concession.

Part of the post-election controversy was a com

pany based in Tampa which bore the innocuous name of

Mary Carter Paint Company".

In 1965 Lansky's front-man (and former Key Bis-

cayne landowner) Wallace Groves, filed a joint ap-

plication with the Mary Carter Company to open a

Inc., 1913 Fillmore St., San Francisco, Calif, 94115

After Pindling's election, Groves was forced out

and the Mary Carter Paint Company had itself two new

casinos.

At the 1967 opening of one of them

the

Nassau Bay Club - the honored guest was Richard

Nixon.

The following year - 1968

— the other. Mary Car-

ter Club,

the Paradise Island Casino, opened for

business.

The owners felt

close enough to Nixon to

offer him use of their facilities during the 1968

Republican Convention.

Nixon felt more comfortable

at Key Biscayne, but some of his staff took up the

offer.

Mary Carter Becomes Resorts International

In 1969 Mary Carter - now called Resorts Inter-

national

- reluctantly

"released" one Dino Cellini,

claiming that while he

"had a relatively unsavory

background,

he had no criminal record,

no criminal

associates".

Cellini hopped across the water to

Miami, where, according to Dade County Sheriff In-

telligence Reports, he continued to work in conjunc

tion with Paradise Island Casino.

The reports al-

lege that Cellini was an almost daily visitor to Re-

sorts International's Miami office, where he checked

credits and worked with a company booking junkets to

the Paradise Island Casino.

There are those who maintain that Cellini's con-

nections with Resorts International symbolize the

influence of Lansky.

was Imertel that ITT hired in 1972 to snoop on col-

•umnist Jack Anderson.

The latest and possibly most damaging charge in

the Resorts International

battle came in June 1972

in an IRS inspired indictment of Meyer Lansky and

Dino Cellini.

The indictment reads in part:

On or about May 17, 1968,

unindicted co-conspira-

tor Vincent Teresa met with defendants Meyer Lan-

sky and Dino Cellini in Miami and had a discus-

sion wherein defendants Lansky and Cellini gave

Teresa permission to conduct gambling junkets to

the Paradise Island Casino.

Thus government agents allege that in 1968 Lan-

sky maintained at least

some control in running jun-

kets to Resorts International's Paradise Island Cas=

ino.

The junket racket is an integral part of the

casino operation,

is indisputable.

Perhaps more disquieting than rumors of Nixon

stock ownership in an underworld holding company for

Bahamian casinos are the reports of his meddling in

Bahamian affairs.

In 1969 a proposed tax increase

on gambling profits to provide money for Bahamian

schools was slashed in half by the Minister of Fi-

nance.

The Minister refused to explain the cut,

and told opposition members to "use your imagina-

tion" for an

explanation.

The advice was taken literally by some Bahamian

papers who speculated that pressure came from

side sources connected with casinos".

one Bahama an

paper asked openly if "a telephone call from the

White House was not responsible?"

Whereas our investigation into Cuban politics

brought evidence to light possible violations of the

Neutrality Act, we now have the possibility of an

American President who has spent a significant

amount of his vacation time in the Bahamas also med-

dling in the affairs of that country.

Richard Nixon, a man with both visible and invis-

ible links to the underworld and politics of pre

Castro Cuba, turns up in the Bahamas with very simi

lar links, bringing some big names along with him.

Enter William Rogers

Two men with histories both in Bahamian politics

and in the finances of organized crime have made

frequent use of the legal

services of a firm whose

most prominent partner is Richard Nixon's old friend

William P. Rogers, one-time Secretary of State.

Royal Commission in 1967, and a business cohort of

The Justice Department's record against

Commission was lackluster,

to say the least.

It was

Rogers who personally rejected the recommendations

of the specially constituted Wessell Committee on

organized

crime set up

in the

wake of the infamous

Appalachian raid in upstate New York that revealed

a Mafia summit conference.

The Committee's propos-

als for a concentrated and coordinated war

ganized crime were only implemented some years later

by Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

A footnote in the Justice Department files was a

report by

IRS Special Agent

19,

1953.

The

Josph Delfine, dated Oc-

IRS recommended to

the Justice

Department that

"criminal proceedings be instituted

against Meyer Lansky

trict of New York for the willful

attempt to defeat

and evade a large portion of his income

taxes for

the years 1945 and 1947 under section 145b

of the

The Justice Department -

with William Rogers second in command at

the time -

respectfully declined to prosecute.

world of gambling casinos and organized crime.

In 1969 Lums purchased the Ceasar's Palace Hotel

and Casino in Las Vegas for $60,000.000.

A month

later the Nevada state gambling authorities were

looking into the hotels'

"catering to twelve under-

world figures from Kansas City".

A few months after the purchase the SEC filed

suit charging Lums and Ceasar's Palace with "false

and misleading" statements.

The

SEC wondered how

Ceasar's managed to lose $1,000.000 in five months

when the previous year (before Lums bought in) there

was a $2,200,000 profit for a comparable time period.

The SEC also questioned Lums concerning the

The Teamsters Again

A recent visitor to La Costa was Frank Fitzsim-

mons,

a key to Nixon's new-found

support in organ-

ized labor.

Fitzsimmons is president of the Team-

sters Union.

This summer

he stopped in La Costa on

his way to see Nixon at San Clemente.

Fitzsimmons

had just come from dinner in Detroit with a local

Mafia figure and soon after his Detroit-La Costa-San '

Clemente excursion, Fitzsimmons announced his sup-

port for Nixon.

One wonders whether the Teamster

decision to stay on the Pay Board and to support

Nixon is somehow related to what the Detroit Free

Press has been hinting strongly as of late: that

Their marriage goes back over

twenty years, where Jimmy Hoffa was introduced to

the Detroit underworld by Paul Dorfman, in exchange

for some multi-million dollar insurance business.

Dorfman's son, Paul, has residences at both Sky

Costa and was recently convicted of

taking kickbacks on a Teamster loan.

The Teamster tradition of labor racketeering and

corruption made for a ready alliance with the mob.

Early government investigations of the Teamsters,

such as the Bobby Kennedy-led McClellan Permanent

Committee on Investigations, centered on labor rac-

keteering.

As Attorney General, Kennedy continued

his pursuit of the Teamsters and their boss, Jimmy

Hoffa.

At one point Kennedy had twenty-nine grand

JurIes simultaneously investigating Hoffa's activity

- one of which led to a conviction for mail fraud

and jury tampering.

•In 1969, two Oakland Tribune reporters concluded

a six-month investigation with the charge that "the

$628,000,000 Teamsters Central States.

Southeast and

Southwest Pension Fund headquartered in Chicago,

has

become a bankroll for some of America's most sinis

ter underground figure".

Nowhere does the relationship between this fund

and the mob surface more dramatically than in Las

Vegas, where Teamster trustees have approved loans

between $50 and $70.000,000,

some shakily secured by

second mortgages and subordinated notes.

A high-

ranking Federal official has commented that

"the

Teamster fund is a sort of open bank to people well-

connected in Las Vegas and well-connected to organ-

ized crime".

It was Hoffa's desire "to have Chis own bank in

that brought on the Teamster takeover of

the Miami National Bank.

The Bank in turn is just

one of a long list of ventures, suchas Ceasar's Pal-

ace, Sky Lakes, La Costa, Worldwide Realty, Interna-

tional Airport Hotel Systems, Truesdale Estates, in

which Teamster money amounting to over $60,000.000

ness partners of Richard N. Nixon - a line of in-

vestments that leads from Nixon's three White Houses

The current head of the Justice Department's

In 1971,

when

a Federal Grand Jury probing the activities of Meyer

Lansky questioned Jimmy Hoffa, many wondered whether

the links between the

two giants were more direct

than the numerous transactions between mutual

friends.

A few months after his testimony, Hoffa was

granted clemency after serving less

than five years

of his thirteen-year sentence.

ney General Will Wilson.

As well as floating more than $40,000,000 to Las

Vegas casinos and $13,000.000 to premier mob attor-

ney Morris Shanker,

ANICO has made loans to two

Florida companies

close to Richard Nixon

$1,750,000 in 1966 to the Mary Carter Paint Company,

and $3,000,000 in 1970 to a subsidiary of Worldwide

Realty.

That year a group of disenchanted stockholders

filed a multi-million-dollar suit, charging ANICO

officials with having

taken control of the company

and using

it as a private preserve as well as a

source of funds

for the mob.

The defendants in the suit hired Nixon's New York

firm to handle the case.

Connally's Houston law

firm has also been used by

ANICO.

The First Na-

tional Bank of Houston, ofwhich Connally was a di-

rector and in which some of his law partners were

officers, has provided an interest-free account of

more than $1,000,000 for ANICO.

Connally was also

a director of a savings association which was pur-

chased recently by ANICO.

Will Wilson was "general" of the Justice Depart-

ment's "war" on crime

Since then

there have been no indictments in the case and there

One source of those

reports is Stewart Hopps, a former Justice Depart-

ment investigator.

Some serious conflict-of-interest charges con-

cerning ANICO remain:

by

* The company also has clear ties to Nixon's former

Treasury Secretary, a man mentioned for the Vice-

and a key figure in the President's

re-election scheme.

Whose Justice Department?

The ANICO case takes us to

a fitting endpoint to

the story of Richard Nixon's involvement with the

underworld the Department of Justice.

It is an

old saw that criminal and criminal-chaser eventually

become

but in Richard

perhaps ever before in American history.

For Rich-

ard Nixon is a man whose name has been synonymous

with

"law and order"

in America for three decades.

Yet the four-year

"war" on organized crime by the

Nixon administration bears more resemblance to the

"peace" in Vietnam than a sincere effort to get at

the mob.

In a recent interview in U.S. News and World Re-

conducting more a publicity war than one on organ-

A Times report this year found the gov-

ernment was building up a backlog of gambling in-

dietments, saving them for a crucial time during the

election campaign.

Indeed, while the Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell team has

used the spectre of "CRIME" to keep the fear level

high and to guarantee large budgets and expanded

powers for their Justice Department, the actual

"at-

tempts" of the Nixon administration to cope with or-

ganized crime have resembled a somewhat sinister up-

date of the Keystone Cops.

For example,

up to 1,000 of Kleindienst's vaunted

1600 indictees in gambling and organized crime may

have their cases thrown out for somewhat dubious

"improper procedures" technicalities.

A Miami at-

torney named James Hogan has

"discovered" irregular-

ities on signatures required for electronic surveil-

lance authorizations.

Court-approved wiretaps re-

quire written authorization by the Attorney General

of a designated representative, in this case Will

Wilson.

Instead of being

signed by John Mitchell or

by Wilson, the authorizations in question were

signed by aides, thus rendering thousands of wiretap

authorizations - and the indictments based on them

- useless.

Hogan himself is a long-time syndicate attorney

and a partner of Ben Cohen,

a former political boss

of Miami Beach who

figures prominently in the For-

ties'

takeover of Miami by organized crime.

The

case in which Hogan made his discovery involved the

busting of the largest heroin/cocaine ring in Miami,

many of whose members were Cuban refugees.

Inspec-

tion of various court papers,

including wiretap

authorizations,

confirmed

"irregularities" in the

signature - Will Wilson's signature.

While resem

bling his actual handwriting,

the signatures ap-

peared as "Wil" instead of

"Will".

While it may seem strange for an aide to misspell

his boss'

name, it seems even stranger that Hogan

took the case.

His normal

fees start in five fig-

ures but he has been working on behalf of his court-

declared indigent client for more than two years

with minimal compensation.

While Hogan is known as

a "very thorough"

attorney, it would be interesting

to find out more about the circumstances in which he

discovered the

"irregularities".

Even more interesting.

perhaps,

are the circum

stances under which Richard Kleindienst was offered

a bribe of $100,000 to quash several mob indictments

In sworn testimony in November 1971, Kleindienst admit-

ted to being offered the $100,000 bribe (which would

be

paid in the form of a contribution to Nixon':

1972 campaign) in exchange for stopping prosecutior

against several underworld figures caught in a stock

fraud case.

The bribe was offered by an aide of

Senator Hiram Fong,

a Republican from Hawaii.

The

aide had worked previously with Kelindienst through

Fong's position on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Kleindienst said he refused the offer but he also

said he did not realize it was a bribe for an entire

weekl

In cross examination,

the prosecutor asked Klein-

dienst,

"If you had regarded the conversation as

something regarding a bribe

Kleindienst admitted he reported the bribe a full

week later, upon learning from J. Edgar Hoover that

Federal agents were investigating the case.

One would expect the Attorney General of the

United States to be more alert.

But what is more

troubling are reports aired in the Washington Post

shortly after the indictments in the stock fraud

sase in question (and ten months before Klein

dienst's testimony on the bribe).

Those reports

quoted

"sources at the U.S. Attorney's office in New

York and indicated that after the meeting between

Kleindienst and Fong's aide,

"Kleindienst immedi-

ately contacted Justice's Criminal Division [then

headed by Will Wilson and ...

an FBI agent was as-

signed to infiltrate the group of alleged conspira-

tors".

DO

we now believe Kleindienst's story that he

"didn't realize" he had been offered a bribe, or

do we believe the U.S.

Attorney's office in New

York?

Did Will Wilson and the Justice Department

hold off a week while Kleindienst

"made up his

mind" that he had been offered a bribe, or was the

decision whether or not to take it?

And did Hoover

and the FBI somehow interfere?

#ghaps the answer comes in the final outcome of

the ectual

prosecution involved.

The defendants in

the stock-fraud case included Meyer Lansky's son-in-

law.

a former director of the Bank of Miami Beach

and Johnny Dio, a notorious racketeer long associ

ated with Jimmy Hoffa.

They were acquitted,

while

the messengers who offered the bribe were convicted.

One wonders if that $100.000 did not

find its way

into the Republican secret treasury after all.

The Tip of the Iceberg

*The organized criminal relies on physical terror

and

psychological intimidation, on economic re-

taliation and political bribery, on citizen's in-

difference and government acquiescence.

He cor-

rupts our governing institutions and subverts our

democratic processes."

- Richard Nixon, April 24, 1969

Someone should tell President Nixon that resist-

ing the power of organized crime demands, above all,

a President with a clean slate.

Nixon's life is like a complex jigsaw puzzle, the

pieces of which have been shuffled so as to defy

complete reconstruction.

Some of the crucial pieces

have been removed,

so a full picture cannot be

achieved.

It is no accident

that no other politi-

cian has been so much written about, yet so little

understood.

Indeed,

much has been made of the

"enigma" of

Richard Nixon, his tight-lipped bearing in relation

to his personal life,

his unwillingness to divulge

what's really on his mind.

But maybe the answer to the enigma lies in his

old poker-playing instinces,

in the unfailing abil

ity to keep

quiet when he's sitting on cards best

hidden from the table.

For there is one indisputable fact about Richard

Nixon's career

his ascendancy to the pinnacle of

American power has required twenty-five years of

care and feeding by some very wealthy and very re-

actionary men, and an extraordinary number of them

have maintained connections with the world of or-

ganized crime.

During Nixon's years in office the underworld em-

pire in the United States has prospered almost unre-

stricted by the Federal government.

From its base

In the gigantic resources of heroin traffic, gamb-

ling, prostitution, "protection," and a host of

other enterprises of violence against society, or-

ganized crime has moved like a bulldozer into the

world of legal, "respectable" business.

Every link between Richard Nixon and organized

crime, however marginal, is of significance, if for

no other reason because he is President.

And there

are people all over America, from government intel-

ligence agents to hotel waiters.

who have Nixon

stories to tell.

He covers his tracks well, but not

well enough.

The full extent of Nixon's involvement with or-

ganized crime is just beginning to surface. The

evidence in this article is merely the top of a

dirty iceberg that will slowly become visible over

the coming years.

The milieu in which he has traveled for three

decades, and in which so many of his friends, as-

sociates, and appointees have been related to the

mob, throw a long and permanent shadow over every-

thing Richard Nixon the "public servant" has ever

said, and over everything his political life has

ever meant.

For in light of his career, both past and pres-

ent. Richard M. Nixon seems to be the factual

em-

bodiment of Ralph Salerno's prediction that organ-

ized crime would someday put its own man in the

White House.

The information in this article was gathered

during a six-month investigation carried out in

many cities, primarily Miami,

New York, Washington,

D.C., Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Dallas,

Austin, Galveston,

Tallahassee,

and San Francisco.

Sources included interviews with over a hundred

people; court documents (including deeds, mortgages.

etc.); research in the National Archives, Washing-

ton, D.C.; organized crime intelligence files (both

private and government); and newspaper clippings.

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical ..:

Computers and Automation, established 1951 and

therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-

puters and data processing, believes that the pro-

fession of information engineer includes not only

competence in handling information using computers

and other means, but also a broad responsibility.

in a professional and engineering sense. for:

- The reliability and social significance of

pertinent input data;

The social value and truth of the output

results.

In the

same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-

fessional responsibility for

the reliability and

significance of

the data he uses, and the safety

and efficiency of the bridge he builds. for human

beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes

articles and other information

related to socially useful input and output of data

systems in a broad sense. To this end we

publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical

for all humanisy. an earth in whic

our children and later generations may have a fu-

ture, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engineer needs to

relate his engineering

to the most important and

most serious problems in the

world today: war,

nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo-

sion, and many more.

NATIONAL AMERICAN BANK INSTALLS

COMPUTER-BASED SECURITY SYSTEM

Tom Burbank

Notional American Bank

200 Carondelet

New Orleans, La. 70130

A computer-based system designed to prevent un-

authorized access to high security areas has gone

into operation at National American Bank here

one of the first U.S. banks to install such a sys-

tem.

The IBM Controlled Access System (CAS) at Na-

tional American is based on the use of magnetically

encoded, wallet-sized identification cards similar

to bank credit cards.

Each person authorized to enter a security area

is assigned a card coded with his own security num-

ber.

Employees seeking entry

to an area covered by

the system simply insert their cards into compact

reading devices

va curtance doors.

and. the informa-

tion is transmitted to an IBM System/7 computer for

identification.

Stored in the computer's memory is a list of em-

ployee numbers and building areas these numbers are

designated for.

If the

number of the card entitles

the bearer access to that area,

the computer signals

the door to unlock.

If the person is unauthorized

to enter.

the door remains closed and a security

guard is notified. The elapsed time is approximately

one second.

If a card is lost or stolen, a new card (with a

new number) is issued and the system is alerted to

deny entry to the original card." If the old card

is used, the guard is alerted.

As an additional safeguard, the system can aulo-

matically log all entrance activity by individual

security code, door number, date and time of day.

This helps track who is where and for how long.

National American can now analyze the number of

times an individual enters and at what time of day

or night this activity occurs.

The system also has

built-in failsafe mechanisms which insure security

in the event of a power failure.

"Unfortunately,

we are doing

business in a time

when public and

private institutions are increas-

ingly vulnerable to lawless elements,"

said National

American President Louie J. Roussel III.

"By adding

the IBM Controlled Access System to our current se-

curity procedures, we are taking a major step to in-

sure that our customers and employees are protected.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has be-

creativity.

The facility also will provide an ex-

Music composers at Iowa

State University may turn

from their piano keyboards and hand-written scores

to a more efficient

instrument

for composing music

- a computer.

ISU faculty members are building a

computerized electronic music studio - a system

that will technologically simplify composing

tronic music.

The

elec-

studio is being designed and

built by

an interdisciplinary group from

departments,

under

and electrical en-

the direction of Stefan

Silverston, assistant professor of computer science.

Terry Smay, professor of electrical engineering, and

Gary White, associate professor of music.

Electronic music is

produced by

purely electronic

means and the Iowa State, Computerized Music System

(ISMUS) will be doing just that

generating music

with computer equipment.

A composer will sit at the

computer and write a musical composition using an

electronic keyboard.

The new system, which was expected to be operable

this fall, should be an easier

method of modifying

and editing a musical piece.

The normal hand opera-

tions of changing notations on a printed score or

splicing tapes of recorded music are "more time-

consuming and inaccurate" processes for correcting

a composition, according to Gary White.

The computer composing process begins when the

composer inserts introductory

instructions into a

teletype machine.

On an electronic keyboard he then

begins to compose his piece.

The computer records

all musical instructions which are transformed

through a digital-to-analog sound converter and

loudspeaker into sound.

This immediate feedback

system enables the composer to hear what he is com-

posing simultaneously.

The computer also allows the

composer to automatically play back and edit what he

has written simply by striking another key.

The musician has now completed one

If he wants to add

further musical instruc-

the pro-

grams (sequences of operations to be performed by

WILL YOU HELP?

Yes, you. It may come as a surprise that you'd be asked

... but as a reader of Computers & Automation you are

in a unique position to help us.

NAMES ... people, institutions, companies who

should be interested in 1) the computer industry and/or

2) seeking truth in information are very much needed to

join you as readers of C&A.

Will you tell us who they are? And perhaps even more, will

you let us use your name in writing to them? But with or

without your name (we'll only use it if you grant permission)

we need to know those you think might be interested in also

reading C&A.

It's the first lie detector that

can be used on a dead

man. It works on tapes and

other voice recordings

by George O'Toole

Assassination Tapes

The rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either

-Plato: The Republic, Book Three

It's a little frightening.

The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with

a high degree of reliability, whether or not you are lying. It's called the Psychological

Stress Evaluator,

and it is, in eifect. a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it. needs

no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.

It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph

record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on

a dead man.

Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. I resolved to use

it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President

John F. Kennedy. I set about collecting every recording I could lay my hands on

of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon I had compiled the tape-

recorded testimony of twenty-two persons-eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the

pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,

Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren.

I ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in

turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?

Was Oswald the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-

graphs which the Warren Commission never saw-do they support the Commission's

lone-gunman,

single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?

Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture I expected. Not

all the details are there, but I guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory

of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark

Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong

The PSE is not a crystai ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function

it performs well. To my knowledge.

this was the first instance of its use as a tool

for historical research. To understand what I did with the PSE, one should know some-

thing about the device itself.

I first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last

year, when I met two of

its inventors, Alian D. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, both

former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form

a company called Dekto: Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. It was a logical second

career for the iwo men. Both are experts in the technology of espionage. Either one

could pick the lock on your front door in less time than it takes you to find your

key. Colonel Bell wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and

small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit. from anti-bugging devices

to a miniaturized microdot camera. Colonel McQuiston is one of the foremost polygraph

experts in the U.S., a specialist in radio and audio surveillance, and a qualified locksmith.

points: whether the Mannlicher-Carcano

Texas School Book Depository, and whether

that particular gun could have been the mur-

SUBJECT

MURK.N

Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Attention: Mr. S.J. Papich

16 MAY 1968. 112

Report on Suspicious

Actions of Gerald Lee Richards, Originally

Described as Resembling Suspected Assassin of

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

1. Reference is made to the report concerning the above

subject made by telephone to Mr. S.J. Papich at 0930 on 17 April

1968. Following is a full account of the investigation made in

this case:

A. On 16 April 1968 a United States National

Maritime Union official in Yokohama reported that one

Gerald Lee Richards, who bore a general physical

resemblance to the description given of the suspected

assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had arrived

in Japan about

15 April 1968 and requested a position

aboard any ship going anywhere.

Richards became

agitated when asked for a contact address in Japan

and refused to divulge his Japanese residence.

National Maritime Union official describé: Richards

as 5° 10" tall, 155 pounds, with brown hair, a receding

hairline on both sides, and a not very prominent scar

two and one-half inches long traversing the center

forehead, his most outstanding characteristic being a

disconcerting, idiotic grin resembling a constant

grimace.

According to Richards' documents and state-

ments, he was born 8 April 1937, applied for seaman's

papers in San Pedro, California, 16 June 1964 and

registered there as a United States National Mariting

Union member on 21 February 1968 but never shipped out

His Social

Security Number is 562-46-5078; his United

States Coast Guard Number z 2711-782.

B. A subsequent check

confirmed the biographic data supplied

by the National Maritime Union official.

A ward check

indicated that Richards originally resided in Japan

from 1963 to 1964 and married TAKAYAMA Michiko in 1963.

Both Richards and his wife left Japan for the United

States in 1964. Richards returned alone to Japan about

15 April 1968.

1s listed

as 160 Hosoi (phonetic) Street, Carpenteria,

California, 93013.

C. A photograph of Richards

was shown to the National Maritime

Union official and identified by him as the individual

in

• subparagraph IA above who had applied for a seaman's

berth.

The photograph of Richards bears no apparent

resemblance to photographs of suspected assassin

James Earl Ray provided by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

The above information has been given to the Legal

Attache of the United States Embassy in Tokyo.
