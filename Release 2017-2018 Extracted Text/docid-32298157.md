The Los Angeles office currently rents an apart-

ment at 8410 Fountain Avenue, Los Angeles, for use as an

observation post in connection with physical surveillances

conducted of JUDITH E. CAMPBELL, 8401 Fountain Avenue, anc

in efforts to establish a highly confidential informant who

can furnish information concerning CAMPBELL's activities.

CAMPBELL is a friend of JOHN ROSSELLI and also of

SAM GIANCANA, Chicago hoodlum, to whom CAMPBELL makes

numerous long distance telephone calls. On several occa-

sions CAMPBELL has made long distance telephone calls to

EVELYN LINCOLN, Confidential Secretary, White House, Wash-

ington, D.C.

At approximately 9:30 p.m. on 8/7/62 SA WILLIAM

R. CARTER, who at the apartment at 8410 Fountain Avenue,

observed

two white males on the balcony of CAMPBELL's apart-

ment at 8401 Fountain Avenue.

The two men walked back and

forth past the windows of CAMPBELL's apartment and. peered

inside.

The drapes were drawn and lights were on' in the

living room of CAMPBELL's apartment.

One of the men appeared to knock on the window,

and when he apparently received no answer, he opened the

lanai type window and entered while the other man kept

lookout from a kneeling position on the balcony.

Descriptions of the two men were obtained by SA

CARTER.

After one of the men entered the apartment, SA

CARTER left the apantmenttat 8410 Fountain Avenue to endeavor

to obtain a license number of an automobile the two men might

have.

He observed one of the two men enter a late model blue

Chevrolet Corvette and drive hurriedly away.

This car had no

License plate on front. The rear license plate was a Texas

plate, #EC2400.

It hung down on one side as if it was not

permanently affixed to the vehicle.

The San Antonio office

has been requested to furnish registration data re this Texas

license plate.

SA CARTER did not observe if these men carried

anything from CAMPBELL's apartment.

The above is furnished for the Bureau's informa-

tion. UACB, this office will not disseminate this informa-

tion

to the

LACSO, which has jurisdiction over this area

for the following reasons: 1.

It is not known if CAMPBELL

will discover this burglary and this it would not be re-

ported, or if she does discover it, whether she will report

The operation of the Los Angeles office in this

matter, which made possible thesobservation of the burglary,

is of an extremely sensitive nature.

This office has made

very few open inquiries concerning CAMPBELL's activities so

that a highly confidential source, if developed, might prove

more

productive.

It is my opinion that dissemination would

most likely jeopardize the entire operation.

The Bureau will be kept advised of any pertinent

information developed concerning this

burglary.
