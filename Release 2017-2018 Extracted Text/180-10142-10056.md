NELSAGE OF THE DOCUWENT

of the U.S. Intelligence Community.*

as redacted

As a visual aid to the analysis of the materials

contained in the four compilations discussed above, a

chart has been prepared which illustrates the flow of

written information from the CIA to the Warren Commission

and the U.S. Intelligence Community concerning President

Kennedy's assassination. This chart sets forth the C IA's

designation for each document listed and lists the subjéct

matter of each document and the date of each document's

dissemination. The chart also indicates whether the document

was made available to the Warren Commission, the U.S.

Intelligence community or both. A secondary purpose of

this chart is to indicate for selected subjects the volume

of information provided to the U.S. Intelligence Community

as opposed to the Warren Commission.

During the course of this study, additional Agency

files have been reviewed. These files have been examined

in an effort to resolve certain issues created by the re-

view of the Agency's compilations discussed herein. Where

apparent gaps existed in the written record, files have

been requested and reviewed in an effort to resolve these

gaps.

Where significant substantive issues

have

arisen

related to the kind and quality of information provided

the Warren Commission, files have also been requested and

Mr. Rocca added that, to his knowledge, Mr. Helms'

orders were followed to the letter by all CIA employees.

(Ibid. p. 24.) Mr. Rocca concluded that on this basis:

"the CIA was

to turn over and to develop any information

bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

to the Warren Commission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was

propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation was directly responsible for the

CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination

(Ibid. p. 23.) He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren

Commission). We would attempt to respond

to it.

But these inquiries came in indivi

dual items... Each individual item that came

along we took care of as best we could.

(Ibia., pp. 10-11.)

However, it was Mr. Helms' recollection that the

CIA provided information to the Warren Commission primarily

on the basis of the Commission's specific requests. Under

The following exchange between Committee Counsel

and Mr. Helms illustrates the acutelaxity the Agency's

compromise:

Mr. Goldsmith:

Mr. Helms:

Mr. Goldsmith:

Mr. Helms:

Mr. Goldsmith:

Mr. Helms:

Mr. Heems, I take it from your testi-

mony that your position is that the

anti-Castro plots, in fact, were rele-

vant to the Warren Commission's work:

and, in light of that, the Committee

would like to be informed as to why

the Warren Commission was not told by

you of the anti-Castro assassination

plots.

I have never been asked to testify before

the Warren Commission about our operations.

Ifithe Warren Commission did not know

of the operation, it certainly was not

in a position to ask you about it.

Is that not true?

Yes, but how do you know they did not know

about it? How do you know Mr. Dulles had

not told them? How was I to know that?

And besides, I was not the Director of

the Agency and in the CIA, you did not go"

traipsing around to the Warren Commission

or to Congressional Committees to to any-

place else without the Director's permis-

sion.

Did you ever discuss with the Director whe-

ther the Warren Commission should be in-

formed of the anti-Castro assassination

plots?

I did not, as far as I recall.

• MI. McCone testified that he first

became aware of the CIA's anti-Castro assassination plots

involving CIA-Mafia ties during August 1963. He stated

that upon learning of these plots, he directed that the

Agency cease all such activities. (McCone deposition, p.13)

the CIA desired to withhold information from the Warren

What I can't

John Scelso, the above-cited CIA desk officer

who ran the CIA's initial investigation of President Ken-

nedy's assassination until that responsibility was given

to the CIA's counterintelligence staff, offered a highly

critical appraisal of Helms' non-disclosure to the Warren

Commission:

Mr. Goldsmith: Do you think Mr. Helms was acting properly

when he failed to tell the Warren Commission

about the assassination plots?

Mr. Scelso:

No, I think that was a morally highly re-

prehensible act, which he cannot possibly

justify under his oath of office, or any

other standard of professional public service.

(Scelso dep., p. 153)

III. Introductory Section/SS+M

The length of time required by the CIA to respond

to the Warren Commission's requests for information has

been shown to have been dependent upon 1) the availability

of information and 2) the complexity of the issues pre-

-.

sented by the request. On this point, Mr. Helms testified

that when CIA had been able to satisfy a Commission re-

quest, the CIA would then send a reply back:

"and some of these inquiries obviously took

longer than others.

For example, some might involve

checking a file which was in Washington.

Other

inquiries might involve trying to see

if we could locate somebody in some overseas

country.

Obviously, one takes longer to per-

form than the other. (Helms Exec. Session

hearing, p.25)

Mr. Rocca, as the day to day CIA working level

contact with the Warren Commission stated that on the

average it took less than one week for the CIA to transmit

its information to the Warren Commission, after such in-

Each of these concerns will be examined

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations, as outlined above, was

evident from the

#ifception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

to reveal all our technical operations." (Scelso dep.

p.158) Scelso further testified:

as December 20, 1963, at which time a cable was sent from

On February 1, 1964 Helms appeared before the

Commission (see above) and likely discussed the memoran-

dum of January i , 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee

Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of

January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

as of his wroters.

the Warren Commission

had no substantive knowledge

or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-

(eripts, trom that oporation. Bankin enguired in the rab

ruary 10, 1964 letter whether Oswald's direct communica-

tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in

of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated

by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-

mission had been informed o

oswald this inquiry

no he do

by Rankin would not have been made.

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this

conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between

the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-

mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headquar-

ters in Langley, Virginia and had been shown various trans-

cripts resulting from the CIA

Mexico City. (Rocca dep. p.89) However,

Mr. Rocca did not personally make this material available

to Commission representatives and was not able to state

under oath precisely the point in time at which the Warren

Commission learned of these operations.

On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to Rankin's

inquiry of February 10. The Agency response did indi-

cate that Oswald had phoned the Soviet Consulate and was

also interviewed at the Consulate. However, the Agency did

not reveal the source of this information in its response

to the Commissionfor indicate that it would be revealed

by other means

(e. g. by oral briefing).

During the period of March - April 1964, David

Slawson drafted a series of memoranda which among other

issues concerned Warren Commission knowledge of and access

to the production material derived from the ciel

Mexico City. A review of

these memoranda tend to support the Committee's belief

that the Warren Commission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman,

and willens did not obtain access to cIl

materials until April 9, 1964. Att

that time, Coleman,

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to

Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions

concerost Oswald's

were derived from CIA

Mexico trip,

that he had reached

memorandad of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

and in addition a Mexican federal police summary of

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, (sic)

an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that salwson placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that Sawson had been provided the Duran

transcripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments

conerning the Mejican police report,

it would appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

Insert p 28

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported

by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)

Wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

weate wa based upon an analysis of sylvia Duran's testi-

mony before the Mexican police.

the Dorticos-Armas transcripts_at the March 12, 1964

meeting between Commission representatives and Agency re-

presentatives. (Cite.)

On April 3, 1964, Coleman and Slawson articulated

their concern for receiving-complete access to all material

relevant to Oswald's Mexico City trip. They wrote:

The most probable final result of the entire

investigation of Oswald's activities in Mexico is

a conclusion that he went there for the purpose

of trying

to reach Cuba and that no bribes, con-

spiracies, etc. took place.

VI. Mexico City Mystery Man

On November 23, 1963, Marguerite Oswald was shown by

FBI Special Agent Odum a photograph of a man bearing no

physical resemblance to her son. That photograph had been

supplied to the FBI on November 22 by the CIA's Mexico City

Station after Agency representatives had searched their files

in an effort to locate information on Oswald. This photograph

was one in a series

resulting from the CIA's photosurveillance

operations against the Soviet and Cuban Embassy/Consulates

prior to the

assassination,

affidavit before the Warren Commission, stated that the

photograph shown to Marguerite Oswald had been taken on October 4,

1963 in Mexico City and mistakenly linked at that time to

Oswala. (ertecHahns bffidaust in WCR)

On February 10, 1964, Marguerite Oswald testified before

RELEASE

On March 12, 1964, representatives of the Warren

Commission and the CIA confered

regarding the February 12

request for the materials forwarded to the Secret Service by

the Agency. (See Rankin letter of March 16, 1964 and Slawson

memo, March 12, 1964)

The record indicates that the Commission at the March 12

meeting pressed for access to the Secret Service materials.

Rankin wrote to Helms on March 16 that it was his understanding

that the CIA would supply the Commission with a paraphrase of

each report or communication pertaining to the Secret Service

materials "with all indications of your confidential communica-

tions techniques and confidential

sources deleted. You will

also afford members of our staff working in this area an

opportunity to review the actual file so that they may give

assurance that the paraphrase are complete." (Rankin letter of

March 16, 1964, #2)

Rankin further indicated that the same procedure

Helms responded to Rankin's March 16 letter on March 24

(DDP4-1554, CD631 and DDP4-1555, CD 674) by two separate

communications. CD631 provided the Commission with a copy of

the October 10, 1963 CIA dissemination to FBI, State Dept.,

INS and Navy Dept. (SS on 22 Nov.) regarding Lee Harvey Oswald

and his presence at the Soviet Consulate in Mexico City. The

response further revealed that on October 23, 1964, CIA had

---

## Page 28

- 39 -

requested two copies of the most recent photograph of Oswald in

order to check the identity of the person believed to be

Oswald in Mexico City.

Furthermore, the CIA stated that it

had determined that the photograph shown to Marguerite

Oswald on November 22, 1963 did not refer to Lee Harvey Oswald, This

was done by checking the photograph against the press photographs of

Oswald generally available on November 23, 1963.

CD 674 reveals that on November 22, 1963, immediately

following the assassination, and on November 23, 1963, three

cabled reports were received at CIA headquarters from the CIA

Mexico City Station regarding photographs of an unidentified man

who had visited the Cuban and Soviet Embassies during October

and November 1963. Paraphrases of these cables, not revealing

sensitive sources and methods, were attached to CD 674. The

Agency further stated that the subject of the photo referenced

in these cables was not Oswald. It

further stated that:

"In response to our meeting of 12 March

and your memo

of 16 March, Stern and Willens will review at Langley

the regional copies of these 3 disseminations to the

Secret Service and the cables on which they were based,as

well as the photos of the unidentified man."

(CIA,

p. 116444 of notes)

On March 26, William Coleman wrote in a memorandum for

the record:

"The CIA directed a memorandum to J. Lee Rankin on March 24, 196

(Commission Document No. 631) in which it set forth the

dissemination of the information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

I realize that this memorandum is only a partial answer

to our inquiry to the CIA dated March 16, 1964 and I hope

that the complete answers

will give us the additional

information we requested."

Coleman went on to state:

"As you know,

Marguerite Oswald soon after the assassination.

I

hope that paragraph 4 of the memorandum of March 24,

inquiry."

The following day, as agreed by Warren Commission and

Agency representatives, Samuel Stern of the Commission visited

CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

offiseisit

Sterns' memorandum reveals that he reviewed Oswald's

file with Raymond Rocca. Stern indicated that Oswald's file

contained those materials furnished previously to the Warren

Commission by the CIA. The file also contained:

Cable reports of November 22 and November 23 from

the CIA's Mexico City Station relating to the photo-

graph of the unidentified individual mistakenly

believed to be Lee Harvey Oswald and the reports on

those cables furnished on November 23, 1963 to

the Secret Service by the CIA.

Stern noted that these messages were accurately para-

phrased in the attachments to CD 674 provided the Warren

Commission on March 24, 1964.

Stern also reviewed

the October 10, 1963 cable from

CIA's Mexico City Station to the CIA headquarters

reporting Oswald's contact with the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City. He also reviewed the October 10,

1963 cable from CIA headquarters to the Mexico City

Station reporting background information on Oswala.

---

## Page 30

- 41 -

Stern noted that these messages were also paraphrased

accurately as set forthin the CIA's January 31 memo to the

Warren Commission reporting Oswald's Mexico City trip.

Lastly, Stern noted that Rocca provided him for his

review a computer printout of the references to Oswaldrelated

documents located in the Agency's electronic data storage

system. He stated "there is no item listed on the printout

which the Warren Commission has not been given either in full

text or paraphrased."

Thus, by the 27th of March, a Warren Commission representa-

tive had been apprised of the circumstances surrounding the

mysterious photograph.

VII. Allan Dulles' Role vis-a-vis the CIA-Warren Commission

Relationship

It has been alleged that Allan Dulles, former Director

of Central Intelligence and one of the seven members of the

Warren Commission, concealed crucial information from the Warren

Commission. Specifically,-the Senate Select Committee

concluded:

"With the exception of Allan Dulles, it is unlikely

that anyone on the Warren Commission knew of CIA

assassination efforts...Allan Dulles, who had been

Director of Central Intelligence until November 1961,

we an a bulan too ha he .

was a member of the Warren Commission and knew of the

CIA plots with underworld figures which had taken place

during his tenure at the Agency." (SSC, Book V, pp. 67-68)

However, the SSC did not explore further the relationship and

allegiance of Dulles

as a Warren Commission member and Dulles

as

a former DCI of the CIA. The Committee has consequently

reviewed files maintained by the CIA related to Mr. Dulles'

was written by David Murphy, Chief of the Soviet Russia Division

who was

Nashake's

er's interrogation.

David Murphy's memorandum of July 8, 1964 concerned

his discussions with Allan Dulles about Nosenko's knowledge

of Oswald. This memorandum was prepared for DDP Helms.

Murphy wrote:

"Mr. Dulles, with whom I spoke today recalled his

earlier conversation with you on this subject and said

that there were still some members of the Commission who

were concerned lest they suppress the Nosenko information

now only to have it surface at a future date.

They

expressed concern that this could possibly prejudice

the entire Warren Commission Report."

Murphy responded to Dulles' statement by stating that

the Commission's concern was understandable but that the Agency

felt the Commission's final report should make no mention of

Nosenko's information. Murphy indicated that a possible

alternative would be to use language "which would allude to

the existence of other, unverified information on the Oswald

case." This language, Murphy contended, would permit the

Warren Commission to state, if challenged on this point at a

future time, that it had given consideration to the Nosenko

information.

---

## Page 32

- 42 -

Murphy continued:

"It was agreed an effort would be made to find such

language if Mr. Dulles is again unsuccessful in

persuading his colleagues to eliminate any reference

to the Nosenko information from the report.

To attempt

this, however, we would have to know precisely in what

context the Warren Commission intended to make use of

the Nosenko information.

This, Mr. Dulles will have to

determine from Mr. Rankin. He will do this as soon as

possible. He knows that I am leaving this week and

therefore, will contact you as

tion he needs from Mr. Rankin."

Whether by design or as an unintended result, the

quoted language indicates that Mr. Dulles,

as a member of the

Warren

Commission, was prepared to compromise his position

with the Commission in order to supply the CIA, specifically

about

Murphy and Richard Helms, with sensitive information

the Commission's attitudes towards the Nosenko case. Italso

appears that the AGency had communicated

Luisa Calderon

- 43

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's

assassination,. a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named

"Luisa" received a telephone call from an unidentified man

speaking Spanish. (MEXI 7105, 27 NOV. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-

ment) This call had been

by the CIA's

Mexico City Station as the result of its

operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the

Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon; who was then

employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban

Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified

caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa

replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The callerwent on to tell Luisa that the person

apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of

the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that

she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being

held for the killing was a gringo.

The unidentified caller

replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned

nothing else about the assassination that she had learned

about the assassination only a little while ago.

The

unidentified caller commented:

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic com-

ments do not merit serious attention. Her words may in-

deed indicate foreknowledge of the

assassination but may

also 3y be interpreted without such a sinister impli-

cation.

Nevertheless,

as will be discussed herein, the

Committee has determined that Luisa Calderon's case did

merit serious attention in the months following the assas-

sination. However, Calderon's comments were not reported

to the Warren Commission, apparently an agency oversight.

on December 16, 1963, less than four weeks after the as-

sassination.

Calderon, Azcue and Mirabal were not arrested nor

detained for questioning by the Mexican federal police.

However, Silvia Duran, a friend and associate of Calderon's

investigated Luisa Calderon.

This was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had

intercepted a letter to her by an American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar.

a rare one in

As you know, the pronunciation of

Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so

I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-

dez should be spelled. It could have been "Howard"

or something different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love letter

but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and

Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the

case officer) that after the interception of

the letter she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American. I do not know if this

could have

been Oswald...

On May 11, Raymond Rocca wrote a memorandum

to director richard delms regudiag the information

had elicited from AMMUG. Rocca proposed that "the DDP

(11 May 64, Rocca memo, FOIA687-295 with/4 attachments).

On May 15, 1964, Helms wrote Rankin regarding

AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its sensi-

tivity and operational significance. Attached to Helms'

communication was a paraphrased accounting of

May 5 memorandum. (Helm's memo, May 15, 1964, FOIA 697-294) .

In that attachment the intelligence associations of

forth. However, that attachment fakes no reference. what-

soever to Luisa Calderon.

Howard Willens of the Warren Commission, requested

as a follow-up to the May 15 memorandum, tatastrot the

questions used

in

¿interrogation of AMMUG. (DoOley

memo to Rocca, 19 June 1964 FOIA 739-310). On June 18,

1964 Arthur Dooley of Rocca's Counterintelligence kesearch

and analysis group took the questions and AMMUG's responses

to the Warren Commission's officers for Willen's review.

Willens sauphan sent

May 5 memorandum. The only mention

of cideron was as follows: "The precise relationship of

Luisa Calderon to the DGI is not clear. She spent about

six months in Mexico from which she returned to Cuba early

in 1964.

However, Willens was not shown

the

memoran-

dum of May 7 and May 8, 1964 which contained much more

It should be noted that these memoranda of May 5,
