Re New York teletype dated 5/5/67•

Referenced teletype contained information received

from NY 3586-C-TE that ANIELLO DELLACROCE had succeeded THOMAS

EBOLI as head of the GENOVESE underworld "family". NY 3586-C-IE

was instructed to pursue this matter for possible confirmation.

NY 3586-C-TE advised he received the information about

DELLACROCE sueeding EBOLT frOm ANDREW BUCARO aka Andy Curley,

FBI # 349167. Informant describes BUCARO as an old time member

of LCN in the GAMBINO or BONANNO "family" of ICN. BUCARO's

arrest record reflects an extensive criminal record dating

back to 1923•

NY 3586-C-TE states he has attempted to discuss this

matter with GERARD MOSIELLO, THOMAS MUSTO and ANTHONY MOSIELLO

who informant describes as members of the GENOVESE "family" of

Informant states he has been unable to corroborate the

story he received from BUCARO, but does believe that DELLACROCE

has received some sort of promotion within the framework of the

underworld.
