"SECURITY INDOCTRINATION AND SECRECY AGREEMENT

A special system of security and control, known as the EYEMAN

Security and Control System, has been established by the Director of

Central Intelligence for the purpose of providing maximum security

protection to a number of extremely sensitive intelligence collection

projects.

Each of these projects requires a separate, special security

approval for access.

In your official capacity in connection with U.S.

Government communication systems you have been granted a BYECOM

approval which permits you to perform your official duties as regards

BYEMAN projects in general, without regard to the necessary separate

special security approvals..

Strict adherence to the BYEMAN Control

Manual and all supplemental directives must be adhered to in the handling

of BYEMAN materials or information. You are requested to read and

sign the Secrecy Agreement and Oath.

1. In connection with my indoctrination into the BYEMAN Control

System, I acknowledge my full understanding of an agreement with the

following provisions:

a .

Security restrictions and penalties for violations of the

BYEMAN Control System, to which I am subject, are covered

under Title 18, Sections 792, 793, 794, 795 and 797, U.S. Code

and Section 19 of Public Law 831, Internal Security Act of 1950.

b. It is my responsibility to ascertain that persons with whom

I may have reason to discuss materials or sources of BYEMAN

activities

to any degree have also been properly cleared and

designated to receive and discuss BYEMAN information.

c.

By reason of my BYEMAN clearance alone I do not have

access to all BYEMAN information or materials but only those

required on a "MUST KNOW" basis.

d. I will report to the BYEMAN Security Officer immediately

any violations of BYEMAN regulations of which I become aware.

e. I will advise the BYEMAN Security Officer of any

personal changes in my status or assignment.

No change in my assignment will relieve me of my obligation

under oath and that the provisions of this oath remain binding at all

times.

2. I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will never divulge, publish,

or reveal either by word, conduct, or by any other means any classified

information, intelligence,

or knowledge relative to BYEMAN sources

except in the performance of my official duties and in accordance with the

requirements set forth in the EYEMAN Control System Manual or

supplemental directives.
