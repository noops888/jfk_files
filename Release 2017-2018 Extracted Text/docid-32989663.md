AMBITIOUS YOUNG MAN, WHO IS BASICALLY A POLITICAL ANIMAL. TRUE-

HEART NOTED THAT AARON WAS DIRECTLY APPOINTED TO THE CHURCH COMMITTEE

BY SENATOR WALTER MONDALE. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT TRUEHEART DOES

NOT THINK VERY MUCH OF AARON•

AARON PLAYED A DOMINANT ROLE DURING THE MEETING. AARON COMMENCED

BY STATING THAT THE OPERATIONS OF LEGAT, BRASILIA, AND BUENOS

AIRES WERE REALLY NOT THE TYPE OF LEGAT OPERATIONS HE DESIRED

TO REVIEW, INDICATING THAT LEGAT, MEXICO CITY'S OPERATIONS WERE

MORE OF THE TYPE IN WHICH HE WAS INTERESTED.

AARON ASKED POINIED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE MECHANICS OF

LEGAT REPORTING ON INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPED LOCALLY TO FBIHQ

AND THE LOCAL COORDINATION OF THIS INFORMATION. AARON DESIRED

TOLD AARON THAT IN MY JUDGEMENT THE INTERESTED COMPONENTS OF

NOT VISUALIZE THE AMBASSADOR FORBIDDING ME TO REPORT SPECIFIC •

INTELLIGENCE I HAD DEVELOPED TO FBIHQ AND NOTED THAT ANY OBJECTION

RAISED BY THE AMBASSADOR TO THIS INTELLIGENCE WOULD CERTAINLY

ALSO BE REPORTED TO FBIHQ. I SUGGESTED THAT AARON TAKE UP THIS

REPORTING.

AARON ASKED WHETHER THERE WAS A SPECIAL REASON FOR THE

FBI'S EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON IN 1970. I TOLD AARON

THAT I WAS NOT PERSONALLY AWARE OF ANY SPECIAL REASON FOR THE

1970 EXPANSION ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS BASIC FACT THAT FBI

FOREIGN LIAISON OPERATIONS REQUIRED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL

OVERSEAS TO EFFECTIVELY MEET THE FBI'S INCREASING RESPONSI-

BILITIES. I SUGGESTED THAT AARON CONTACT FBIHQ IF HE DESIRED

ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THIS REGARD.

AARON ASKED WHETHER THE CIA STATION HAD EVER REQUESTED

MY OFFICE TO SECURE DATA FROM "FBI COMPUTER BANKS" ON ARGENTINE

RESIDENIS OF CIA INTEREST, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY RESIDED IN THE

UNITED STATES. I TOLD AARON THAT NO SUCH REQUEST BY CIA HAD

EVER BEEN MADE OF ME. AND THAT IF SUCH A REQUEST WAS RECEIVED

DEA AND THE FBI COOPERATED DIRECTLY OVERSEAS. I ANSWERED THAI THE

FBI AND DEA HAD A VERY CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP IN THE UNITED

STATES AS WELL AS OVERSEAS AND THAT ANY NARCOTIC INTELLIGENCE

INFORMATION DEVELOPED BY THE FBI DOMESTICALLY OR ABROAD WAS

IMMEDIATELY PROVIDED TO DEA. AARON THEN ASKED WHETHER I HAD

IT IS NOTED THAT THE CIA STATION CHIEF CONFIDENTIALLY

ADVISED THAT AARON HAD ASKED WHETHER THE CIA STATION HAD

DETECTED ANY INSTANCE WHEREIN THE FBI HAD REPORTED INTELLIGENCE

DEVELOPED OVERSEAS INDEPENDENILY TO FBIHQ, WITHOUT MAKING THE

INTELLIGENCE AVAILABLE LOCALLY. THE CIA STATION CHIEF SAID

HE TOLD AARON THAT MY OFFICE HAD ALWAYS COOPERATED FULLY WITH

Agent (SA) W. Donald Stewart. A copy of the memorandum is

being furnished for forwarding to Mr. James A. Wilderotter,

Associate Counsel to the President.

In addition to Stewart's report of the interview as

contained in the memorandum, Stewart has advised that during the

interview of him, Mr. Paul Wallach, a counsel for the SSC,

entered the interview room and asked one of Stewart's attorneys,.

Marcus A. Hollabaugh, who was paying him and specifically

inquired as to whether "Justice"

Stewart, Wallach in so many words, said that he felt that if

Justice

Hollabaugh refused to respond to Wallach's inquiry. Wallach

indicated he thought he might call Hollabaugh and put him under

oath.

Attention is invited to that portion of Stewart's

account of the interview where it is indicated that he had been

placed under oath by senator Charles Mc C. Mathias, JI., In the

Russell Building but that the interview itself took place in

another building. Stewart has advised that the Senator did not

accompany the group to the second building and was not present

during the actual interview.

In connection with the legal representation which

Stewart had for the interview, attention is invited to this

Bureau's letter dated September 23, 1975, to the Attorney General,

SSC Seaff lember James Dick advised the Legal Counsel

Division of the FBI that he desired to interview Stewart on

the subject of wail openings.

Stewart was initially advised

by the Legal Gounsel Division that he had a right to counsel

during the interview but that the FBI could not provide him

with private counsel. He was advised that he was released from

his employment agreement relating to confidentiality for the

purpose at answering questions concerning mail openings.

was also advised that the Department of Justice Was in che

process of determining whether there may have been criminal

conduct by FBI personnel who were involved in mail openings.

It was pointed out to Stewart that any statement he gives to the

SSC could be used against him if the Department of Justice

initiates prosecution. He was advised that his appearance

before the SSC is voluntary and whether to appear and respond

to particular questions is a decision he alone mist make.

He was finally advised that the SSC must issue a subpoena before

it could denand he ansver questions and that, absent such a

subpoena, he was not compelled to submit to an interviet.

Re:

Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

W. Donald Stewart by SSC Staff Member

Pursuant to such request, the Department of Justice did arrange

Ior Stewart to be represented in this matter by an attorney,

Marcus A. Hollabaugh,

Subsequent to the interview of Stewart,

he voluntarily furnished to the FBI a handwritten "Memo for

the Record" which is set out below.

Oct 1, 1975

Memo for the Record

Subject: Interview with Staff Member

of Senate Select Intelligence Committee

re Bureau Informant 200

At the invitation of Senate Select Intelligence

Committee Counsel James Dick, I reviewed severa. Bureau

Informant 200 memos taken from the Bureau's control file on

that matter.

. This review took place at Dick's office in the

New Senate Bldg. on the morning of Oct 1, 1975. 1 was

accompanied by my counsels Marcus A. Hollabaugh and Howard Fogt

of the firm of Foley, Lardner, Hollabaugh and Jacobs.

Mx. Hollabaugh is an X-FBI agent (1943-45).

Since we had been advised

that the just i bet as considering the matter involved with

Bureau Informant 200 for possible prosecution we considered

asking for immunity for me at the scheduled interview at 2 PM

on Oct. 1, 1975.

We again reported to the Committee's offices in the

new Senate Bldg. at 2 PM for the scheduled interview.

We dis-

cussed immunity with Senate Counsel Dick and he said to date

no one had been granted same and only a few CIA employees had

ever made the request. By pre-planned strategy we decided if

immunity not readily possible, we would proceed with the inter-

view and, if necessary, invoke the sch Amendment at a time a

question might tend to

be incriminating This never had to be

done.

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re:

Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA.)

Donald Stewart by SSC Staff Member

Prior to the interview it was necessary for myself,

my counsels, the Senate Counsel and the courtroom reporter

to the office of Senator Charles Mc C. Mathias, Jr.,

(Md.) In the Russell Bldg, to get me sworn by him. We there-

after adjourned to Room 608 in the Carroll Arms fox the inter-

view which began at 2:30 p.m. and terminated at 5:40 p.m.

During the interview I was questioned about the origin

of the Hunter Project (Bureau Informant 200); mechanics of

handling the mail; whether the illegality of the project was

considered or discussed at the Bureau and did Mr. Hoover know

of the program.

In regard to the latter, I advised the

illegality was never a topic of discussion because it was not

our program and we

were only the recipients of CIA's product.

We discussed the safeguarding of the material which I advised

was kept in a special mailroom and the entire program was

closely held.

I informed that I doubted if Mr. Hoover was

aware

of the project and really had no reason to know. I advised that

we developed criteria in regard to material which was furnished

to us

and made it clear to Mr. Dick that we were not engaged

in a "fishing expedition" and did not desire any mail not having

a specific intelligence interest to us as outlined by our

criteria passed to CIA.

Mr. Dick asked several questions on the CIA Watch

List - how we added and deleted names.

He had some misimpres-

sions of the Watch List which I believe I corrected.

He was interested in the volume of mail received and

when it increased.

He wondered whether we had an inspector

named "Vince."

this developed as à result or Hunter mail being

identified in some instances as "Hunter - Don" (Moore) anc

other

"Hunter - Vince."

Don Moore had been interviewed for

four hours during the morning of Oct 1, 1975. I

advised "Vince"

was Vince Nasca who handled Cuban matters and mail reflecting

Cuban activity or from a Cuban in the U. S. to one or anyone

in the USSR and vice-versa was automatically routed to Nasca

at that time.

To simplify routing, all such mall was designated

"Hunter - Vince."

Re:

W. Donald Stewart by SSC Staff Member

Mr. Dick did not attempt to be devious at any time,

and we had no points on which he did not seem to be satisfied

with my explanation. For the most part, he handed me a Bureau

Informant memo - 9 exhibits - and he discussed particular

points contained therein.

No great relevations were developed

by him. My interview seemed mainly to provide some clarification

of how

the Bureau Informant 200 program operated. Most of the

information he probably became aware of just by reviewing all

the memos in his possession.

Dick was concerned whether the Justice Dept was aware

of Bureau Informant 200. I said "No,

" no reason to tell Justice

as it was an operational matter within the FBI and the fruits

were not used for any prosecution purposes - only for lead

purposes. He hammered away on use and dissemination of

materials. I informed him any data disseminated in a Bureau

the source of the information.

According to Executive Order 11652, authority to classify is

By teletype dated December 24, 1070, from the

furnish any information they might be able to develop

concerning the activities of Grover C. McArthur abroad.

NSA was advised tichrthur, at that time, was a student at

tho University o1 Lennsyvania and was planning to write a

paper on tho Black Panthor Farty (BPP) and its intornational

operations. NSA was further advised McArthur planned to contact

BPP Offices overseas and he reportedly was to travol to Algiers,

Sweden, Denmarl, Germany, Spain, France and Morocco.

In view

of the

rossibility of his contacting BEP nombors ovorcead,

sone of whom were fugitives, we requested NA's assistance.

It is noted that there were a number of black extrenist

fugitives in 1970 affiltated with the BPP and they were charged

with such crimes as attempted murder and conspiracy to murder.

Donald I. Cos and Leroy Eldridge Cleaver, BPP leaders and

fugitives amongst others, wore suspected of residing in

Algiers and Northern Europe.

By letter dated March 9, 1071, from John Edgar Hoover,

Director, fbl, to the Director of

the NsA, NSA was furnished a

other mail intercept programs which were conducted in the

investigation of criminal matters. They indicated that a

specific request would be forthcoming from the Committee

During the briefing, vr. Wallach mentioned that

Within the past three to six months he had occasion to be in

the New York Post Office Building. In attempting to leave the

building, he accidentally came upon some individuals who were

Mr. Wallach advised

that he was informed that the individuals were Bureau personnel

who were engaged in a particularly sensitive mail cover.

Wallach noted that this situation was not covered in the Bureau's

answer to the Senate Select Committee communication although

our answer did state with respect to mail covers that the

Bureau was continuing to check.

In approximately June, 1975, a Postal service official

advised that one of our Agents had received permission to

photograph

the People's Republic of China United Nations Mission.

notified of this, the New York Office was instructed to have

the Agent refrain from jurther activity along this line.

At the conclusion of the briefing, the Senate Select

Committee personnel indicated that they were aware that the

Bureau's files on Jane Fonda contained a letter that she had

written in Los Angeles to an unknown address in Paris, France.

The Senate personnel indicated that this occurred toward the

end of 1971 which was well beyond the termination of our mail

intercept surveys and the interception of such a letter would

not have fallen within the purview of the

There was no

operational need for the FBI to maincain in its permanent

Memorandum, W.A. Branigan to W.R. Wannall, dated

9/12/75, reported on briefing of Senate Select Committee (SSC)K

staff personnel by SAs J.P. Lee and W.A. Branigan.

During the

course of the briefing, one of these individuals, Paul wallach, !)

mentioned that within the past three to six months, while in

the New York Post Office Building, he accidentally came upon

some individuals photographing the outsides of envelopes.

Wallach said he was informed that these individuals were Bureau

personnel engaged in a sensitive mail cover.

He noted this

situation was not covered in the Bureau's answer to the SSC,

although the Bureau did state, with respect to mail covers,

we were continuing to check.

With regard to the above, New York Office (NYO)

currently operates two authorized mail covers on the People's

Republic of China Mission to the United Nations (PRCMUN) •

One of these involves incoming mail and the other, outgoing

mail.

In approximately June, 1975, the Bureau liaison

Officer in contact with the U.s. Postal Service officials,

Washington, D.C., informed SA H.J. Morgan, Jr., CI-2 Section,

Intelligence Division, a58501lows-REC36 62-11: 5'5

A Postal Service official from Washington, D.C.,

876

had recently been in the New York Post Office and had observed

an individual photographing the outsides of envelopes.

When

he inquired concerning this, he had been informed that the

individual doing the photographing was an FBI Agent.

this time there was abundant publicity concerning CIA personnel

working on Post Office premises with regard to maif openings ar

A Postal Service official was due to testify before a

Congressional committee at about that time and did not destre

to be in the position of stating the FBI was then working on

Post Office premises.

It was requested that the SA involved

be removed from the New York Post Office and the offer was made

that the Postal inspectors would be happy to take any necessary

photographs for the Bureau.

SA Morgan contacted Supervisor K.R. Buckman,

New York Office, by secure telephone at which time SA Buckman

acknowledged that an SA had been photographing envelopes at

the New York Post Office in one particular unknown subject

case involving the mailing of bulky envelopes to a military

man at the PRCMUN/ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

This was being

done in order to assist the Philadelphia Office in identifying

the unknown subject, as the bulky envelopes would not fit

the normal camera used for photographing of envelopes by Postal

Service employees and required a special camera.

Buckman advised that the SA was on annual leave

Supervisor

at that time

and he felt sure the camera had been removed from Post Office

He was instructed to have the camera removed

prediately, if not previously done, and was told to have the

SA cease and desist in the above activity. SA Buckman advised

he would comply with these instructions.

He was informed of

the offer made by the Postal Service to photograph above

envelopes if it was felt necessary in the future. Arrangements

for this would be made through FBIHQ, and no subsequent requests

have been received from the New York Office in this regard. No

written instructions concerning the above were furnished to the

New York Office.

Tom Charles Huston, former Associate Counsel

Interagency Committee on Intelligence in July, 1970,

under

the chairmanship of Director Hoover. . He described

former Assistant Director William Sullivan as chairman

of the so called working study group within the ad hoc

Committee which had convened three or four meetings in

to Mr. Hoover for his approval until CIA, DIA and the

other Committee members had signified their approval,

Mx. Huston testified Messrs. Sullivan and Brennan felt

"this procedure was necessary in order to 'force' Mr.. Hoover's

acquiescence

and for added impact to resolve Mr. Hoover's

'reluctance to participate in the Plan."

Mr. Huston's testimony. underscored previous

that mid-level agency personnel engaged in agency policy

Memorandum to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel

Re: HUSTON PLAN PUBLIC. HEARINGS,

He testified Mr. Sullivan had recommended en-

dorsement of the final ad hoc Committee report to Mr.

Hoover and urged cooperation among the intelligence

agencies "so that we. can overcome past differences."

Following Mr. Hoover's rejection of the ad hoc

report; Mr. Huston testified he had submitted a memoran-

eate or eate the the plan be me attached

dum to Mr. Robert Halderman, former counsellor to President

bear on Mr. Hoover to agree with the plan. See attached

memorandum dated August 5, 1970.

Chairman Church and Senator Howard Baker of

Tennessee, summarized their impression that

although

FBI, CIA, DIA, etc., had been engaged in mail openings,

surreptitious entries, and electronic surveillance for a

number of years prior

to the ad hoc Committee establish-

ment, President Nixon and his predecessors. had been un-

aware of details of these illegal activities and that the

Additionally, President Nixon also had been un-

aware the CIA had been involved in domestic intelligence

such as Agency operation CHAOS, and DIA involvement in

In short each of

the intelligence agencies were

domestic intelligence field doing their own thing" with

no fear of

accountability. Endemic to the failure of the

so called

"Hus ton Plan"

was Mr. Hoover's refusal to par-

ticipate in it because of his question regarding the legality.

'of expansion of mail cover operations.

At the suggestion of Chairman Church,

Hus ton

recommended the abolishment of our Internal Security

Division as an intergral

part of FBI operations citing

what he terms our limited analysis capability in the

domestic intelligence field.

Similar observations had

been made to Mr. Huston by former. Assistant Director

Sullivan during the existence of the ad hoc Committee in

1970, and had been indicated, in Huston's mind, by Director

Hoover's previous unilateral

decision to curtail liaisor

activities with CIA. However, Mr. Huston did not cite

specific examples of our shortcomings in this area, if

any.

Enrough community-vide coordination to diy out tne intornation

by using ail the resources potantially available. lio, of course,

amatter of balancing the obvious risks agrinst the desired

results. I thought we balanced these risks rather cojectircly

•in the report, and iloover is escalating the risks in oider to

cloat his decimination to continue to do business as usual..

1. At sone point, iloover has to be iold who is President.

:"He has become totally unrcasonable and his conduci is detrimental

to our domastic intelligence operations.

In the past to weels,

he has terminatad all FBI liaison with NSA, DIA, the military

services, Secrut Service -- evciyone excopt the

White House.

HIa

terminated liaison with CIA in May. This is bolind io have a

crippling ciect upon the chtire community and is contrary to

his public assurance io, tac Presideni ai inc mecting that there

was close and clioctive coordination and cooperation within tha

iniolligence community. It is important to remomuor tnat tho

chiire intelligence community knows thai the Picsident mace a

positive decision to go acad ard Hoover has now succeeded in

forcing a revieir.

li he gets his way it is going to look like ha

is moie poweriul than the Piesident. He lind his say in the

footnotes and Ri accided against him. That shoula close the

mattei and I can't understand why the 1G is a party to raopaning it.

All oí us aic going to look damn saily in the eyes oHleims, Gajier,

Bonnett, and the miliary chiofs il iloover can unilaterally steise

a Wiosidential decision basad on a report that many people rockad

their noses of to peepere and which, on is ineriis, vas a firsir

is bullshit! this is particularly true with zogaid to FBI campus

(c) "I don'i have the personnel to do the job the

•President wants done." The ansuer is (l) he has the people and/=

(2) he can get them.

(l) "I don'i object to liSA conducting surrectitious catry

¡ they mandio. " The ansiver is that NSA doesn't hare the pasple,

can't get thar, has no authority to get them, and chockdn't here

to get them, it is an caijou.

(c) "'Ii wa dó these things the ¡jackals of the press' and the

•ACuU vill find out, ve can't avoid leaks. "

Tie can avoid

lealis by using trained, trusted agents and restricting inoricège si

sonsitive operations on a strict necdio know casis. We do this

or ocher seasitive operations avery day.

(6). "Il I have to do thosa things, the Aitorney General

will have to approve them in writing. " This is up to the AG, but

I would tall iloover that he has been instructed lo do them by

the President and he is to do thom on that authority. He nocdn't

lock toã a scape goat.

c has his authority from ine President

and he doesn't need a written memo from the &G.

To maintain

scrarity, we should avoid wiitan communications in this arca.

(g) "We don't need an inter-Agency Committee on

Inteiligance Operations because (1) we're doing fine sight rov --

5003 coordination, oic. -- and (2) there are other

cristing groups

which can handle this assignmont." The answer is that we are

doing lousy fight now and there aren't other groups which can

do the job we have in mind bacase: (i) they don't mect; (2) they

don't have the people on thein we vast or hare some people va

(5) thej aren't linkad to the White House stail.

There are doubtless' anothei dozen or so spacious arguments

that roover will arise, but thoy will be oi similar quality. I hose

that jou vill be able to coarince the do of the importance and

necessity of acting Hooter to go along.. We have worked íor

the outset of the first interview,

I was furnished and signed an "ADVICE OF RIGHTS" statement which

was retained by Mr. Epstein.

his. Epstein began his interview by asking questions

concerning my Bureau assignments and tenure of service as an

official of the DID. These matters I answered fully.

Mr. Epstein asked

Joined the DID in 1955 to the time 1 recired. Among the things

covered in my response were the following.

I identified by name the various Assistant Direciors

were Alan Belmont, William C. Sullivan, Charles D. Brennan and

Edward Milles.

The Branch Chiefs, in addition to myself,

were Carl Hennrich and Donald E. Moore. I furished the

He then

why I could not funish more specific information concerning

not provide any additional

Mc. Epstein then colled my attention to a menorandun

Re: Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo

by SSC Staff Members

Epstein also called my attention to a 1963 SAG Letter

instructing that intensified efforts be made by the field to

develop the maximum possible information concerning Conninist

Party efforts to infiltrate and influence other organizations,

and asked if this did not indicate a change in direction of

the investigation of communist infiltration of organizations

because he

said he read into that SAG Letter thai lt was desired

that the field develop information for possible counterintelligence

use.

I called his actention to the fack that the Letter speaks

for itself and did not contain language wnich would support

his assumptions.

Mr. Epstein also noted that the Bureau had used

microphone coverage on King from time to time.

He showed me a

memorandum which related to a telephone call I had received from

New York requesting authority for New York to place microphone

coverage on King.

With reference to microphone coverage, he

asked if our coverage was placed for the purpose of developing

personal misconduct as to King as well as intosnation conceming

communist influence and I told him that as the particular

menorandum reflects it was to determine the nature of the

communist influence around King-

He then asked if I had the

authority to approve such microphone inscallation at that time.

I pointed out that as the memorandun in question reflects time

was of the essence, I had approved New York's going ahead with

with

it and did send the instant memorandum through for final approval

and it was, in fact, approved by lix. Hoover.

Iix. Epstein also made reference to the handling of

Klan and racial matters, noting that the memoradum referred to

above had been checked for Mr. Rosen, and asked if the General

Investigutive Division at that time was handling racial matters.

I told him that as I recalled this was true as of that time.

Wich Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re:

Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo

by SSG Staff Members

He thea asked how it happened that the racial and klan matters

were transferred to the DID, indicating that he had noted that

DID had more recently supervised these matters.

that as 1 recalled, Mr. Sullivan had recommended in a memorandum

that these matters

be transferred to DID on the basis that they

were of an intelligence-type investigation and he considered it

more logical that they be supervised in DID.

After the above interview conducied by Ms. Epstein

and Miss DeOreo, Martha Talley and John Elliff were called

• and

come into the room to conduct their portion of this interview.

Martha Talley began the interview by asking a series of questions

regarding the origin of the Security Index.

She indicated

considerable knowledge of the general period when the security

Index was developed and asked it i had any knowledge wny the

Security Index was considered necessary.

I told her that I did

noi have detailed knowledge because I was not in the Division at

that time.

However, I understood that the creation of the Index

had been the subjece of discussion between Bureau officials and

Deparimental officials and it was the feeling that a more

efficient and effective list of persons dangerous to the security

of the country should be developed than was available aü the

beginning of World War II.

I was asked by Mr. Elliff who could approve additions

and deletions to the Security Index. In response, I first

pointed out to lit. Elliff that he appeared to have in his

possession a folder containing detailed instructions within the

FBI concerning the Security Index and that such information tas

likely already in his possession. Nonetheless, I did advise

him my recollection was that approvals went up through the

Assistant Director of DID whereas deletions did not go quite

that high in endorsement. I also pointed out that, as in at

other matters relating to the Security Index, approval of the

to the sec

Department of Justice was required.

Again,

it appeared apparent

to me that the Comnittee already had in its possession the answers

to the questions being asked of me in this area.

Re: Interview of Former FBI Inspector Joseph A. Sizoo

Miss Talley then asked what the distinction was between

the Security Index but were designated Key Activists for

administracive reasons primarily within the Bureau.

Miss Talley

also asked about the Agitator Index and why it was

created. I

pointed out that they appeared to have copies of all pertinent

memoranda concerning this and other matters referced to and that

the menoranda would certainly speak for thenselves.

At this point Elliff book over the incerview and

repeated the questions asked by Epstein concerning the transfer

of racial and Klan matters to Division J (DID) and I gave him

in essence the same answer.

Elliff then asked when the Bureau began lavestigations

o1 thie groups opposing the Vietnam War and 1 cold him 1 had no

Independent recollection concerning such investigations.

also asked if I had any recollection as to the instructions chat

went to the field to open investigations concerning new groups

in the general racial field and I told him that i did not recall

such instructions.

Elliff then showed me a 1970 Executive

Conference memorandum written by C.

D. Brennan concernin the

opening of individual active investigations on members of antiwar

and selated groups, it being noted in an SAC Letter that we had

previously not investigated all members of such groups.

He

asked why the Bureau had decided to institute investigation of

individual menbers of such groups,

and I told him I had no

independent recollection of why this was done.

with CIA after the break and I told him it was done by lecter or

telephone by the individual Section Chiefs or DID Froni Office

officials.

Ile then asked if liaison with other agencies, noting

that the discontinuance of liaison with other agencies followed

shortly after the break with CIA, was handled in the same way.

I told him this was the case.

He then asked if the Bureau did

not suffer as a result of the discontinuance of liaison with CIA

and other agencies.

I told him that the Bureau officials and

supervisors did the best they could to fulfill any liaison needs

with other agencies but it was quite obvious from the fact that

liaison was reinstituted some years later and is in effect today

that more effective liaison can be maintained by a separate section.

Elliff then asked if I could tell him what the "mass

media program" was, as he noted on some copies of mail that

copies were designated for Mr. Bishop with the further notation

"mass media program."

I told him I did not recall that he had

requested Bureau clearance for me to discuss such a progran where-

upon he withdrew the question.

He then said there were a couple

of other matters he would like to discuss with me it I felt tree

told him that since his request for clearance had not covered such

matters, I would not discuss such matters.

would be willing to discuss such matters with him it he obtained

clearance and I told him I would not. Elliff also said thai he

had not obtained clearance, but if I would do so, he would like

to ask a series of questions concerning the "Huston Matter" and

also some questions concerning the technical surveillances that

Mr. Elliff's last questions related to the Counter-

the reasons for the approval of the Program and when and why it

was discontinued. I told him I had no independent recollection

with reference to specifically why the Program was created or

why it was discontinued.

NOTE:

Information from Epstein and Elliff was accepted by

Supervisor P. V. Daly of the Legal Counsel Division and Daly

briefed Sizoo before the interview (see Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B.

Adams memorandum, 9/22/75, "Senstudy 75").

After the interview,

Sizoo dictated his statement to a Bureau stenographer and

supplemented it with information he telephonically furnished on

This memorandum summarizes a briefing afforded K-ll

Mr. Walter Ricks, Staff Member, Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities, by Section Chiefs, Joseph G. Deegan

and Robert I. Shackelford and Liaison Supervisor B.C. Rachner,

covering the FBI's relationship with the IRS Special Service

Staff Program.

Ricks was principally interested in the basis for

the FBI's cooperation with IRS concerning this Program, the

extent of any known White House or Congressional influence,

the type of information disseminated to IRS, the mechanics of

dissemination and the basis for the discontinuance of

dissemination.

The FBI's policy of disseminating information of

jurisdictional interest to other agencies within the Executive

Branch of Government was explained to Ricks. Concerning IRS,

it was pointed out that the FBI's first knowledge of the

formation by IRS of its Special Service Staff, originally

known as the Activist Organization Committee,

occurred in

August, 1969, following receipt of a letter from IRS re-

questing that the FBI disseminate to the IRS Special Service

Staff reports concerning approximately 75 extremist and

dissident groups listed by IRS. Following the approval of

former Director J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI proceeded to make

the requested dissemination to

IRS. Although this

concentrated Program broadened our previous scope of

dissemination to IRS, it was explained to Ricks that the

dissemination was responsive to an official IRS request and

fully consistent with the BI's police dissentation to

agencies within the Executive Branch of Government.

further explained that the fBI did not initia win tel

investigations on organizations

subjects of previous FBI investigations. Rather, the FBI

restricted its dissemination to information developed in

current investigations within FBI jurisdiction. From a

practical standpoint, FBI reaction to the IRS request was

not unlike a routine name check request involving a large

group of organizations or individuals.

Ricks was informed that the FBI had no direct

knowledge concerning the ultimate use and disposition of

the FBI information by IRS.

It was pointed out that the

FBI was in no position to challenge the credibility of

another agency's jurisdictional interest without some

obvious basis. In this case, the IRS in making its request

advised that

the information was desired for the purpose of

initiating field investigations and audits looking toward

uncovering tax and gun law violations. Obviously, the FBI

had no reason to question this motive. Concerning White

House influence, Ricks was advised that the FBI had no

direct knowledge of such influence outside of a memorandum

noting a comment by an IRS official that the Special Service

Staff had been formed by IRS as a result of White House and

Congressional pressures. Robert I. Shackelford, Joseph G.

Deegan and B. C. Rachner emphasized they had no personal

knowledge of such pressures nor knowledge of any information

in FBI files evidencing such pressures.

Shackelford and Deegan explained to Ricks the

mechanics of FBI dissemination to IRS as it related to the

Special Service Staff Program.

Briefly, upon receipt of

the original IRS request, FBIHQ officials and FBI field

divisions were alerted to the IRS interest. Upon receipt

by FBIHQ of a report falling within the guidelines, the

substantive Supervisor, following a review of the report,

would designate it for dissemination to IRS. No

dissemination of the report was made at the field level.

The dissemination material was forwarded by a covering

routing slip addressed to the IRS Special Service Staff and

actually transmitted by courier service.

This procedure was

fully consistent with the mechanics of dissemination to

other agencies within the Executive Branch of Government.

In

response to a direct question, Shackelford, Deegan and Rachner

advised that they had no personal knowledge of any

dissemination under this Program routinely received by the

FBI from IRS. It was pointed out to Ricks that the receipt

ithout abiding by the very complex provisions of the IR

ode. These provisions were briefly explained to Ricks b

Rachner.

Ricks asked whether the FBI had any way of

determining the number of reports disseminated to IRS under

the Special Service Staff Program. Ricks was told it would

be impossible to come up with this figure and he dropped the

subject. Ricks also inquired whether Shackelford, Deegan or

Rachner were aware of any instances wherein the FBI had

inspired IRS to take some initiative to investigate a

specific organization or individual. Ricks made specific

mention of the "Cointelpro" program. Shackelford, Deegan

and

Rachner advised that they had no personal knowledge of

such action and pointed out to Ricks that the "Cointelpro"

program was a separate program handled by other areas of the

Intelligence Division.

Concerning discontinuance of the program, it was

confirmed that the FBI terminated its dissemination to the

IRS Special Service Staff in September, 1973, in accordance

with a specific request from the Commissioner of IRS. Ricks

was further advised that, thereafter, the FBI continued

dissemination, pursuant to agreement with the Commissioner,

information only of a jurisdictional interest to IRS in

connection with IRS responsibilities relating to possible

violations of the tax laws.

This dissemination was directed

to the Intelligence Division of IRS. The only exception is

information of a personnel conduct or personnel security

nature which is disseminated to the Internal Security Division

of IRS.

Ricks was very friendly and professional in his

approach. His questions were reasonable. He seemed very

knowledgeable of the background of the program and related

subject matter and at times gave the impression of being

By memorandum 9/17/75, you were advised of the

• ten-

tative schedule for public testimony before the Senate Select

Committee involving

the Bureau. One of the announced topics

involved the Bureau's involvement with local authorities re-

lative to the police raid on the Black Panther Party in

Chicago, Illinois, which resulted in the shooting death of

Fred Hampton, Chicago Black Panther Party Leader.

The representatives of the Committee in previous

discussions with representatives of this Division and the

Department had made overtures regarding the interviews of

Agents involved in the Fred Hampton matter and the ConniEtee

has made document requests in that area. Concern was ex~

pressed to the Committee representatives and to the Department

that a public hearing on this topic would adversely impact on

civil litigation areas out of the Hampton matter involving

Bureau Agents as defendants in their individual and official

It was also pointed out to the Department and Com-

mittee that this particular civil litigation was scheduled for

trial in November

and it was apparent that the Committee's pub-

'lic hearings would be also # held in November.

At the request of the Deputy Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination in the Department, Steven Blackhurst,

SAs Paul V. Daly and Robert C. Blunt met with him and Edward

Christenbury of the Department to discuss this particular

matter. It was the Department's position that since the

Attorney General has indicated that requests of the Senate

Select Committee should not. be refused because of the impact

they might have on civil or criminal litigation that the

document request would have to be fulfilled.

Ins this regard,

Christenbury indicated that Chicago police officers who are*

also defendants in the civil litigation had expressed through

their attorneys the Concern that the release of documents

Christenbury stated that he had conversed with attorneys

representing the local officials and these attorneys in-

dicated that they would fight any motion in the Federal

District Court in Chicago wherein the civil litigation

should be held in the modification of an existing protective

order.

senate select Committee are under a protective order and prior

to release to the Senate Select Committee, the protective order

must be modified. Christenbury stated that the Department would

file a motion to have the order modified at the request of the

Senate Select Committee; however, their request would be neutral

insofar as recommendations to the court:

By this, he explained that the motion would merely

state that the Senate Select Committee had requested material

currently under the protective order by the court and asked

court to consider modifying the existing protective order.

Christenbury stated that it was apparent that from statements

the local defendants'

counsels made that they would resist, as

much as possible, any modification of this order.

It was pointed out to Christenbury that this Bureau

had received unofficial requests that Agents, former or current,

who are defendants in this matter submit to interview and that

we did not feel that such Agents

should submit to interview in

view of the pending civil litigation.

Christenbury indicated

volved as defendants in this matter.

The consensus of those at

this meeting was that it was unfortunate and undesirable that

hearings be held on this particular topic since the very issues

to be raised during the civil litigation would be the focal

Blackhurst on 9/26/75 advised that. he had again brought

, to the attention of John Ellif, Task Force Director of the Domestic

Task Force of the Senate Select Committee, the Department's and

Bureau's concern relative to public hearings on this topic and

Elliff indicated that they were reconsidering having hearings on

this matter and that it was entirely possible that these hearings,

in fact; will not be held. Additionally,

Blackhurst indicated

there have been no further requests relative to the requesting

of Agents to submit to interview by the Committee.

To the best of SA MAC DOUGALL'S recollection, in

BACKGROUN jordan is Chairman of Communications Committee,

Black United Front, lashington, D.C., (WDC), an organization

advocating retaliatory killing of

police officers who attack

members of black community.

Jordan has formed an armed

community defense group stating this is the way to keep

police in their place.

Jordan, on 8/5/70, appeared at TBI Headquarters

demanding FBI Lav Enforcement Bulletins be made available

to him, and when advised this was not possible, he became

offensive. By letter dated 9/12/70 Jordan requested

background regarding FBI contracts for purchasing of office

machines and other data. The Director indicated

"it is

none of their business so disregard the inquiry."

On

11/10/70 Jordan contacted FBI Headquarters demanding to

know why FBI was unresponsive to legitimate demands of

black people, particularly in Cairo, Illinois. Jordan

was "set straight."

As a Key Black Extremist we need significant

information regarding subject's financial sources,

It

approve, attached memorandum should be returned to Domestic

Intelligence Division so that the inclatter returns can be

obtained and reviewed.

INFORMATION CONCERNING

This memorandum recommends uncertified

obtained from the Internal Revenue Service through

the

Liaison Section.

OBSERVATIONS:

Recent events on many college campuses through-

out the nation point up the true anarchistic nature. of the

New Left movement. It is abundantly clear that this

movement is bent on revolution.

As a result, it is

incumbent upon us to closely follow this movement.

part,

In

this can be done through the investigations of its

Key

Activists. We have been conducting exhaustive inves

tigations

of

the activities of certain of the Key

Activists in the New Left.

As a part of our intensification program, we

are inquiring into the financial activity of these individuals.

Part of this inquiry is to consist of

a survey of their

tax returns to determine their financial status,

the source

of their income, and to determine whether their income

supports their ability to travel throughout this country,

and abroad as part of the New Left revolt.

A blind

memorandum for each Key Activist considered for this

phase of our investigation is attached.

RE:

NEY LEFT MOVEMENT

100-446997

DETAILS:

The rapid rise of New Left activity involving large

scale protest demonstrations and student disorders and related

violence including bombings and arsons makes expansion of our

coverage of these matters imperative. A thorough review of the

New Left movement was made looking toward determination of areas •

demanding additional attention and the best approach for in-depth

exploration and evaluation of the problems so that marimum utili-

zation of manpower could be achieved. In order to achieve a

coordinated intensified investigation of the New Leit, in October,

1968, you temporarily assigned four additional supervisors, one

clerk and two stenographs (one released) to the Internal Security

Section from other sections and the steno pool within the division.

The additional manpower has enabled us to afford in-depth

probative supervision to student disorders, protest groups,

New

Left publications and finances, and exploration and evaluation of

foreign influence in the New Left.

We are now able to initiate

surveys and programs to dig into the problem and cope with it.

rather than follow events as they occur.

For example, the following

accomplishments directly resulted from utilization of

additional

manpower.

We have

now received the first of our comprehensive

quarterly reports from all offices on the New Left movement,

These reports have subheadings of major interest to us,

such as

"Incidents of Violence," "Finances," "Foreign Influence," etc.

These reports are particularly valuable to give us a national

picture of the movement at one time and will serve as ili basis

[for preparation of documents in detail for dissemination.

We have completed a field-wide survey of New Left

structure, of particular interest to us, it was determined they

are "shoe string" operations dependent on street sales and

solicitations of funds through donations. No large contributors

New Left.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE:

NEW LEFT MOVEMENT

100-446997

We have radically increased our Key Activists Program,

believing concentration on them to obtain successful prosecutions,

thereby taking them out of the movement, is the best means of

reducing the effectiveness of the movenent.

We presently have

86 cases open on Key Activists and persons involved in foreign

influence in the New Left and are expanding the program as time

permits reviewof files and new material warrants their inclu

SiOR.

On 12/6/68 we held a conference with 12 SACs and their

supervisors at the Bureau.

The conference brought out the need

for concentration of efforts against Key Activists in the New

Left movement with emphasis on developing substantive violations,

local or federal, for which they can be prosecuted.

The shift

of the New Left to violence, including numerous instances of

bombing and

arson, was stressed, pointing out that this activity

lends itself to successful prosecution. Other worthwhile sugges

tions and recommendations were made and are under consideration.

For example, we have instituted, on a 90-day trial

basis, elimination of

follow-up letterhead memoranda to initial

teletypes in routine demonstrations.

Dissemination is being

handled by Xeroxing "clean" versions of the incoming teletype.

The expected savings in clerical and stenographic time in the

field will be tremendous.

Thus far, the change has caused no

problems and appears warranted.

Appropriate recommendations

will be made at the end of the

90-day trial period.

In connection with New Left linances, we have opened

a case on the Louis M. Rabinoritz Founcation which gave more

than $300,000 to various groups including New Left activists.

We are looking toward removal of their tax exempt status.

also opened a case on "Resist," which is engaged in fund

raising

for New Left activities.

We have caused a survey to be made by Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) concerning Key Activists. We have found a number

returns.

This action is consistent with our efforts to obtain

prosecution of any kind against Key Activists to remove them

from the movement.

Foreign influence of the New Left movement offers us

a fertile field to develop valuable intelligence data. To date

there is no real cohesiveness between international New Left

groups, but such an effort was initiated in September, 1968,

lat an International Student Conference at Columbia University.

This conference disclosed that despite the factionalism and

confusion now so prevelant, there is great potential for the

development of an international student revolutionary movement.

We are initiating

investigations aimed at identifying prominent

foreign New Left leaders and activists and to increase our reser-

voir of background information regarding foreign New Left organiza-

This also encompasses travel on the part of groups or

individuals either to or from the U.S., and will include inter-

national conferences.

We have

taken over the supervision of sedition and

related cases involving antidraft activity, which centers mainly

around The Resistance.

We have received information indicating..

extensive contacts and cooperation between Canadian antidrait

groups, which openly and actively encourage draft evasion by

Americans, and many U. S.

groups and individuals.

There are also

indications of a clandestine escape route between the U. S. and

Canada,

Available figures show there are in excess of 140 U.S.

deserters in Canada and

estimates of draft evaders run into the

thousands. In addition, the Army has advised that it expects

the full impact of the drafting of college graduates by the end

0f 1969 г

By that time one in every five unlisted men will be

a college graduate and the Army anticipates a resulting increase

in agitation and subversion by individuals who became committed

to resistance while in college.

The Army has recently compli-

mented us on our coverage in this field and asked for our continued

emphasis of these investigations.

Possibly the best utilization of manpower has been

that it enables us to afford close supervision to these cases.

Our expanded coverage has enabled us to afford intensified

investigative attention to the widespread and diverse activities

of the New Left in order to define the movement, penetrate it

and cope with it.

In addition, this unit has assumed overall responsibility

for immediate dissemination of information concerning campus

disorders, including the activities of black student groups. This

problem is becoming increasingly important in its national scope.

Also, because many sedition allegations arise from the activities

of New Left protest groups, these cases have been assigned to

this unit so they can be coordinated with the existing investiga-

The intensified coverage made possible by the additional

manpower is reflected

in the nearly tripled case load within four

months in this unit.

Success of our expanded coverage to date warrants

establishing it on a permanent basis.

A review of the New Left

movement at this time does not disclose any indications of diminish

ing activity in the foreseeable future, but increase in violence

in demonstrations, particularly on campuses, and an increase in

terroristic tactics including bombings and arsons against the

U. S. Government.

Furthermore, it is apparent that the old-line communist

groups such as the Communist Party, USA, the Progressive Labor

Party, the Socialist Workers Party, and

particularly its youth

affiliate, the Young Socialist Alliance are making a determined

effort to

move into the New Left movement to exert a greater

influence and control over its future activities.

we see the New Left movement holding up as heroes international

communists such as Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh, and Mao Tse-tung.

More and more we aiso see old-line leftist groups influencing

thinking of the New Left along Marxist lines

and giving direction

to attacks against the police in general and the FBI in particular:

to arive us oft the campuses; as well as attacks against the new

administration to degrade President Nizon. We can expect this

activity to intensify greatly in the future.

the only way we can force offices to put manpower on these

We also opened a case on "Resist" which is engaged

in fund-raising for New Left activities.

We have recently sent out instructions to all

field offices to eliminate "Videm" captions and to use description

captions, setting out the organization primarily involved in

the title. This greatly helps routing of mail to appropriate

desks and forces the field to identify the primary organization

responsible. It is also expected to facilitate closer super-

vision of the organization cases.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

With respect to Item 12, Part VII, of the SSC

letter of August 20, 1975, a discussion was also held regarding

this Item at the above-mentioned mceting with Mr. Epstein.

It was agreed that in order to locate information received by

the FBI from the Central Intelligence Agency regarding King,

the search at FBIHQ would be confined to abstracts of King

file and subtiles.

Subsequent review of these abstracts dis

closed three documents,

copies of which are baing delivered.

Clearance for release of these documents to the sSe was

obtained on September 17, 1975, from Mr.

Walt Elder, Assistant

to the Director, Central

Intelligence Agency,

Regarding Item 16 d, Part VII, of the August 20, 1975,

request, it is noted that thek. w. snich memoranuum to

br. W. C. Sullivan, dated June 2, 1968, and captioned

"Martin Luther King, JX',

Request by President Lyndon B.

Johnson for Detailed File," in the first paragraph, refers to

a "memorandum of Mix. Deloach to Mr. folson, 5/24/68 same

title, which set forth the request of the President, conveyed

through Special Counsel Larry E. Temple, for all information

conceining King...

An exhaustive search of all logical files,

indices and abstracts has failed to locate this memorandum

dated May 24, 1968.

During the same neeting between Mr. Epstein and

representatives of the Intelligence Division of the FBI,

Mir, Epstein nodified Item 16 d. He advised that responses con~

cering playing tapes or offers to play tapes, dissemination of

transcripts or offers to disseminate transcripts, be Limited to

such actions regarding the White House or to persons outside

the Executive Branch tather than to persons not employed by.

the FBI as stated in the request under Item 16 d.

In response to Item 1 a, Fact 1, or the sse request

dated August 26, 1975, the following is

Page 7 of FBI

menorandua of July 24, 1975, identifying electronic surveillance

(elsur) reflects that Dr. King

"was overheard on three occasions

on tesurs on other parties,"

The SSG request of August 26, 1915,

asked for the identification of the targets, addresses, and

dates of installation and termination of the ovechears

retrieved because the elsur indices

"did not come into ex-

istence until October 5, 1966.'

elaboration of this problem in view of the instructions sent

co Ireld ottices in October, 1966, directing them to submit

the names of all individuals whose voices have been monitorec

through a microphone installed or a telephone surveillance

operated by the oftice anytime

since January one, one nine

six zero!"

To further elaborate on this particular Item and to

offer clarification, the following three factors are submitted:

Prior to issuing instructions to field offices in

October, 1966, directing them to submit the names of all indiv

iduals whose voices have been monitored through a microphone

installed or a telephone surveillance operated by the offices

anytime since 1/1/50, additional surveillances on which king

was monitored are unaccountable for as these surveillance logs

have been destroyed.

2. Prios to the instructions, personnel handling

logs may have felt that overhears were of no substance of

significance and consequently were not recorded.

The setting up of the elsur indices was a field-

wide project of large proportions and the instructions going

to the field 10/5/66, were subject to broad interpretation,

thus leading to possible misinterpretation of these instructions.

Also, the factor of human error might be invoived, thereby

causins incomplete indices until the mechanics of the procedurc

were lioned out.

The above responses to Items 7 a and b were discussed

and agreed upon during the above-mentioned meeting between

Mr. Epstein and representatives of the Intelligence Division

of the FBI.

With respect to Item 10 c, Part I, of the SSC request

dated August 26, 1975, included in the material being delivered

with this memorandum are the only communications in FBI files

which we have been able to locate after an exhaustive file check.

SENATE SELECI COMMITTEE ON INCELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

It should be noted that nemorandum of C. D. Deloach

to Mr. Mohr dated December 1

is being delivered with this memorandum refers

to another

memorandum of Mr. DeLoach, dated November 21, 1964, authorizing

Deloach to furnish Bradlce certain information on a confidential

pasis at the time or ais visit to rbiho.

Search of appropriate

Ciles at FBIHO failed to locate Deloach's monorandum datec

November 21, 1964.

With respect to the excisions in materials being

delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason

for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the

information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations

monitored during clectronic surveillances of King.

In some

it can be ascertained precisely what Incornation in

FBi filos came from electronic surveillances of Dr. Kings

however, there exist areas where documentation of the information

is not precise and no accurate determination can be made.

Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions of the

material being furnished do not contain information developed

as a result of electronic surveillances of king.

Upon delivery of naterial with this menorandum we

have fulfilled all sequests concerning King contained in the

SSC requests of August 20, 1975, and August 25, 1975.

WASHINGTON BUREAU CHEE AWA

""NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE

WASHINGTON, D. C.

MY.

By letter dated 11-10-64 the captioned individual advised the Director that on

that date his publication was beginning to prepare a cover story on the Director and request-

ed the Director's indulgence and cooperation in this matter. While no definite date has

been arranged for the publication of the story, it is presently contemplated that it will be

published around the first of 1965 probably in connection with the Director's birthday.

Bradlee points out that the Director and the FBI have been such a major force in America

history for so many years that they really need no "peg." He requests the opportunity to

take a color picture of the Director for the magazine cover at the Director's convenience and !

if the Director is agreeable, to do this as soon as possible due to the time lag involved in

the engraving. He also requests a series of interviews for Mr. Bill Gray whose assignment

it will be to get the most up-to-date picture of the Bureau's operations, techniques, ambitions:

and problems. He indicates this could be worked out with you (Mr. DeLoach). Bradlee also |

anticipates an eventual request for an opportunity to talk with the Director in as much detail

as the Director will allow. Mr. Bradlee stated that he looks forward to seeing the Director

decause in doing this cover story for the publication he wants it to be "flawless."

Your office has had generally friendly relations with Mr. Bradlee who has been

favorably disposed toward the Bureau. He has been with "Newsweek"' since 1954, about six

vears of this time in Paris, France. Before that he was a press attache at the American

Embassy in Paris, a reporter for "The Washington Post" newspaper here in Washington

and an office boy-librarian for Roger Baldwin, Director of the American Civil Liberties

Jnion in New York City. In 1951 he was the subject of a special inquiry - State Department

nvestigation conducted by this Bureau reflecting generally the foregoing information.

1951 his name came up on several occasions in connection with a leak of classified information

which appeared in a "Newsweek" magazine article. There was some indication that the

'Newsweek" story was an intentional leak of information by the Administration. It is noted

hat Mr. Bradlee was an extremely close associate of the lateugesident Kennedy, visiting

socially in each others homes and in the Kennedy Administration, Bradlee was the entree

M. A. Jones to DeLoach

With regard to "Newsweek"' magazine, we have had our ups and downs

lover the years in our relations. In the past several years "Newsweek" has/taken over by

the owners of "The Washington Post" newspaper. We have had friendly relations with a

number of individuals connected with "Newsweek"' particularly Raymond Moley who is known

to the Director on a first-name basis. Over the years we have furnished some degree of

cooperation to "Newsweek"' magazine. In years gone by we have had correspondence with

Malcolm! Muir, former President of the publication pertaining to inaccurate information

concerning the Bureau which appeared in the "Periscope" section of the publication. Also,

in 1959 there was a typographical error in an article concerning "The FBI Story" movie for

which Mr. Muir apologized.

Mr. Bradlee mentioned that the story assignment would be given to Mr. Bill

Gray. Bradlee pointed out that Gray is comparatively new with "Newsweek" and was

'formerly a reporter for the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" in St. Louis. He also pointed out /

that Gray has had occasion to work with you (Mr. DeLoach) and other members of the Burea:

His dealings with your office gave every indication that he is favorably disposed toward the

Bureau and in 1962 the Director wrote the suburban news editor of the'St.. Louis Post-Dis-!:

Patch" thanking him for the very favorable article prepared by William S. Gray entitled,

"Policemen of Many Communities Trained by FBI in Use of Arms." It is noted that the SAC

at St. Louis worked with Mr. Gray in preparation of this article and that Office had no

information of a derogatory nature concerning him at that time. Our relations have been

circumspect since 1940 with the'St. Louis Post-Dispatch"' due to unfavorable stories; how-

ever from time to time certain representatives of its staff have prepared favorable stories

about FBI facilities.

OBSERVATION:

It would appear that we should cooperate with "Newsweek"' in the preparation

lof this article. Bradlee and Gray appear to be favorably disposed toward the Bureau and

have been friendly. In as much as the magazine plans to do this article on the Director any-

way we would gain nothing by not cooperating, and or the other hand through cooperation

we could perhaps exercise some degree of control over the article. You could go over this

matter with Bradlee and determine in detail just what he desires.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

I. That the Director approve cooperation with "Newsweek"' magazine in the

preparation of a cover story on the Director which that publication is already beginning to

prepare.

2. If the Director approves, you (Mr. DeLoach) should contact Mr. Bradlee

and work out with him the details of the matter, at the same time acknowledging Bradiee's

11-10-64 letter to the Director.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINE InES

Mr. Tolson has suggested that the "Newsweek" people consider usage of

the Autry color photograph of the Director rather than having one made for the cover of

Newsweek" magazine in comection with their fartacoming feature story.

I discussed this matter with Ben Bradlee, Washington Bureau Chief,

"Newsweek, " on 11/19/64 and again on 11/20/64. Bradlee has now indicated that

"Newsweek" would appreciate having their own color photograph of the Director.

They

stated that the Autry photograph, while good, is not the type photograph they want for

the cover of their publication.

Bradlee assures me that it will take only a few minutes

and as a matter of fact, he desires to come in personally with the photographer to make

certain that a good job is done. He mentioned that by him being allowed to shake hands

with the Director,

and meet the Director personally, this will eliminate the necessity

of the Director being interviewed by a "Newsweek" reporter. He indicated they would

be in and out of the Director's Office in not more than 10 to 15 minutes.

ACTION:

I have advised Bradlee that the photographer can take this photograph

on Monday, November 23rd, at 10:00 a.m. This was in accord with the Director's

instructions on my memorandum of November 17th (attached). I did not tell Bradlee

'that he could come in with the photographer, however, will do so if the Director has

no objections.

However, information furnished to the Bureau from the Department of Army, Office

in July, 1957, and married one Emilie Lee, aka LiESiao-Linged chinese NationalIst

who was born 1-21-33 in shangnal

such nefarious practices as giving kiekbacks, free rooms and girls, and free liquor

to TowS Navy personnel. She was-strongly suspected of being involved in the narcotio

business. While-in the Tokyo area, she reportedly entertained U.S. Navy officers

and some of these officers were seen entering her home and staying overnight. Prior

to her arrival in Japan, information was reported that twenty-five Chinese women

Jones to DeLoach Memo

RE: FEATURE ARTICLE CONCERNING DIRECTOR

"NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE.

Lee reportedly.was.issueda-visa-on-7-10-57 to depart Hong Kong

with her new husband, Martin. Their destination was an address-in NewXork City.

Bufiles_reflect no.additional information since-2-1-58.when Immigration and

Naturalization Service-requested-a-name check-and-was referred to the other

appropriate intelligence agencies for information on Lee. It is not known whether

Martin is*still married to-Lẻë.

Bradlee's suggestion to bring along Martin appears to be a move to

include a brief interview with the Director during the picture taking. It is not

believed the Director would desire to have anyone else present other than Bradlee

and the photographer, and in view of the above information on Martin, it is felt

Bradlee's proposal to bring him along should be turned down. •

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That Bradlee be advised early Monday, 11-23-64, that the Director

prefers only to have the Newsweek photographer and Bradlee present later at 10:00a.m.

when the photograph is to be made. He will be informed this is because of the

Director's extremely heavy schedule plus his impending trip out of town the

following day which makes it impossible for him to consent to any lengthy interview

of discussion..

2. That mispectar wial give Bradlee, on an off the record basis,.

' a brief background on Martin's wife concerning the information mentioned above.

The Director approved my memo of Saturday, 11/21/64, that I

confidentially advise BenBradlee, Bureau Chief, "Newsweek"' Magazine, Washington,,

Do Ce, that we could not honor his request to bring his New York writer, Dwight Martin,

in to see the Director on Monday morning, 11/23/64. Referenced memo set forth con-

siderable derogatory information concerning Martin's wife, who, according to State

Department, ONL and Army information, associated considerably with Chinese communists

and participatea in running, a chnese brother

It was recommended and approved trat 1

advise Bradlee, upon his visit to FBI Headquarters, of this information on a stricti • off-

the-record basis.

Bradlee was advised of the above information upon his visit to FBIHead-

quarters 11/23/64; he stated he would keep this strictly off-the-record and that we could

trust him implicitly in this regard.

Bill Moyers, while I was at the White House today, advised that word

had gotten to the President this aiternoon that Bradlee was telling all over town that the

FBI had given him considerable information concerning the wife of a "Newsweek" writer.

Bradlee was also telling around Washington that the FBI had told him that Martin Luther

King was a sexual degenerate. Bradlee, according to Moyers, had stated to several

peopletedt,

"If the FBI will do this to Dwight Martin and Martin Luther King, they will

undoubtedly do it to anyone for personal reasons."

Moyers stated the President wanted to get this word to us so we would

know not to trust Bradlee. Moyers also stated that the President felt that Bradlee lacked

integrity and was certainly no lover of the Johnson Administration or the FBI. _ I told

Moyers this was certainly obvious.

The foregoing facts certainly indicate on a potive lasts the lack of

truthfulness and integrity in the "Newsweek" bunch.

"NEWSWEEK" CRITICISM OF DIRECTOR AND FBI

SUBJECT:

In connection with captioned matter, "Editor and Publisher, " in the issue

of 12-12-64, has identified William Gray and Jay Iselin as the two representatives who

obtained the background information at FBI Headquarters upon which the captioned story

was based. It was also indicated that Dwight Martin and Lester Berns were responsible

for rewriting the story. The Director has asked for a check of our files concerning

William Gray, Jay Iselin, Dwight Martin and Lester Berns.

M. A. Jones to DeLoach Memo

re: "NEWSWEEK" CRITICISM

that Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby were informants of the FBI. On this occasion,

Iselin was informing the Bureau what he knew about Buchanan and Buchanan's contact

with Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach who apparently was feeding Buchanan some

erroneous statements about Oswald and Ruby.

In February, 1964, Iselin contacted the Bureau regarding a statement by

Attorney Edward Bennett Williams to the effect that Federal agencies had been conducti: :

a wire tap on his client, Bobby Baker. We gave him no comment. In March, 1964, we

gave Iselin some preliminary figures on the Uniform Crime Reports release for calenda.

year 1963.

In connection with the "Newsweek" story earlier this month on the Director,

former SAC Harvey. Foster had been contacted by Iselin for some of Foster's views when

he was with the FBI. Foster gained the impression that Iselin was objective, fair and high-

minded and appeared to be interested in doing a factual, objective story on*the Director and

the FBI.

Lester Berns:

We have no record in Bureau files on Berns; however, a check of the "News-

week" masthead reveals that Lester Bernstein is one of its Senior Editors. We have

never conducieu an investigation of him and our contacts with him have been limited. He

was given a tour of FBI facilities on 3-26-63, while accompanied by his two sons, at

which time Bernstein was identified as National Sales Editor of "Newsweek." The tour

was arranged by "Newsweek's" Washington office. Bernstein wrote Mr. DeLoach a very

cordial letter for the courtesies extended on the tour, which was acknowledged by the

Director by letter dated 4-10-63. The New York Office contacted Bernstein in July, 1964,

in connection with the diary of Oswald being leaked to certain news media. Bernstein was

cooperative during this contact.

William

Gray

DC

Bufiles reveal that we have never investigated this individual. Pricto his

assignment with "Newsweek," hewas a reporter for the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch." He

has always been very cordial in connection with his contacts with the Bureau, and in 1962,

the Director wrote the Suburban News Editor of the'St. Louis Post-Dispatch" thanking him

for the very favorable article prepared by Gray entitled "Policemen of Many Communities

Trained By FBI in Use of Arms." Gray was the individual who did most of the leg work

here at FBI Headquarters in connection with the "Newsweek" article; however, it is under-

stood that most of his copy was eliminated from the final draft prepared by the higher-ups

on the Editorial Staff of "Newsweek. "

CASSIFIED

Newsweek's Editor

Upholds FBI Story

Osborn

Elliott,

editor

of

Newsweek, is standing pat on

the

story the magazine puo-

lished

Dec. T that President

Johnson has decided he must

find a new chief of the FBI to

replace J. Edgar Hoover.

The editor's stand

is in the

face of a White House denial

and a charge by Clyde Tolson,

FBI Associate Director, that.

the magazine's cover

story on

his boss represents "a new low

in reporting."

Mr. Elliott told E&P: "It is

the kind of a story you expect

, will be denied. It is part of the

game.

No Reason

to Retract

*"Our information from the

White House came from such a.

reliable source we see no reason

•to retract."

Newsweek's Washington Bu-

reau Chief, Ben Bradlee, added

. that "sometimes you are so far

ahead of a story that you can

be denied.

There can

be some

truth in the denial without less

truth in the original statement."

Stating "a search was on" for

a successor to Mr. Hoover, the

magazine reported it would be

a dificult job to find the right

person. It was generally agreed

by those close to the story that

its publication probably

has

prolonged Mr. Hoover's tenure.

As to Mr. Tolson's criticism,

Mr. Elliott said:

"This story

for us represented perhaps a

new high in the number of peo

ple interviewed

for a cover

story, the number of crackpot

critics of the FBI ignored, and

the amount of legitimate criti-

cism checked with FBI sources."

Mr. Elliott produced the file

of information dug up by News-

week reporters from which the

final piece was written. It was

five inches.thick and a conserva-

tive estimate of the number of

, words was between 100,000 and

150,000.

:5,500 words.

The printed story ran

Tini

Eitylery About Letter ==3

How the letter from Mr. Tol-

son became public has elements

of mystery surrounding it. Mr.

Elliott said it was his policy not

to make public the contents of

a letter of this sort.

Cartha D: DeLoach, Assistant

Director at FBI headquarters,

said an Associated Press report-

er

told him that a Charlotte,

N. C., radio station was claim-

let To had rite A

fiant noted the FBI to mole the

contents public.

Mr. DeLoach

said

he told the reporter he

should ask Mr. Elliott to re

lease it.

Then, he said, the AP

sent a man to his office, who,

by quoting parts of the letter,

convinced him that it was

somebody's hands,

in

and conse-

quently he gave him a copy.

This was on Sunday, Dec. 6.

AP then contacted Mr. Elliott

at his New

York home.

He

didn't have a copy there of his

reply to Mr. Tolson,

but said

that in it he said the magazine

was still standing by its story.

He also conceded that News-

week

"seems to be 'in error

concerning the letter that we

understood that was not sent to

Robert Kennedy," sympathizing

with him on the assassination

of his brother.

A copy of Mr.

Hoover's letter to the then At-

torney General was unearthed

after a search promoted by the

controversy.

- Seecific Objections

Mr. Tolson took specific ob

jections to several parts of the

Newsweek story.

Search

for

successor.

George Reedy, President John-

• son's press secretary, said the

magazine should have checked

with the White House. Mr. El-

liott: "I responded that our in-

formation

to this effect had

indeed

come from a most re-

• sponsible White House source."

Loan of FBI representatives

to Rep.

John J.

Rooney (D-

•N.Y.), head of a House appro-

priations committee.

Mr. El-

liott:

"It

was

confirmed by a

member of the FBI. This week

3

different and authoritative

source informed us that six

Agents

are so assigned, not

five."

About FBI statistics.

Mr.

•Elliott: "We examined

— and

ignored-the major criticism we

found,

an

unpublished

study

prepared for the Bureau of the •

Budget

by

Professor Harry

Manuel Shulman of New York.

We felt that Mr. Warren Ol-

ney's past and present stature

was such that his criticism de

served notice."

Mr. DeLoach

said he wel-

comed the Newsweek reporters

at FBI 'headquarters and gave

them all

possible cooperation.

Mr. Bradlee agreed with this

statement.

Mr. Elliott said that the story

was originally scheduled to ap-.

with Mr. Hoover's 70th birth-

Finally, there

was the extraordinary inter-

during which Hoover called

Martin Luther King, 'the most

"Our exhaustive research was

our schedule. We published the

Fieference is made to my letter dated June 23, 1975,

enclosing a memorandum of the same date responding to a request

from the Senate Select Committee dated May 14, 1975, for certain

documents and other information from the FBI.

In the appendices to referenced letter of May 14,

1975,

the Senate Select Committce requested a list of Cointelpro-type activ-

ity effected subsequent to April 28, 1971, In connection with that

request, we did review our files and contacted knowledgeable person-

nel of the Intelligence Division and, by memorandum dated June 23,

1975, we advised of our inability to locate any information indicating

authorization of any Cointelpro-type activity aiter April 28, 1971.

However, during our subsequent reviews of documents relating to

other requests of the Senate Select Committee, we have located two

documents requesting actions which were authorized and which possi

bly could be construed as falling within the category of "Cointelpro-

type activity." Both of these actions were authorized by former

Director J. Edgar Hoover in February of 1972, but they were not

authorized under the then discontinued Counterintelligence Program,

nor were copies of the documents in these matters includedin.the

Cointelpro files.

As you can see from the enclosure, one activity related

to the suggestion to an editor of a Florida newspaper to write an e

Documents Pertalning to the "Huston Plan,"

Cointelpro, and Other Practices and Programs

Subsequent publication of the Klan's activities resulted in a number

of Klan officials ceasing their activities, and no information was

developed indicating the Ilan was able to expose informants through

the use of the polygraph.

2 On February 29, 1972, FBIHQ responded to a

request of the Louisville Field Office, authorizing an anonymous

letter be forwarded to a Black Panther Party (GPP) office in

New York City. This anonymous letter contained a newspaper clip-

ping discrediting one Benjamin Franklin Simmons, a black exiremist

endcavoring to aifiliate with the Cleaver Faction of the BPP. Subse-

quently it was determined that "seeds of doubt" concerning Siramons'

leadership qualities had been planted at the Cleaver Faction

Headquarters.

information relating to the above proposals and

authorizations did not appear in any Cointelpro-type file of this

Bureaus

The proposals and authorizations were handled in substan-

tive organizational and individual files, and no copies were placed

into a Cointelpro file. The FBI communications approving the two

actions were reviewed by various officials at FBIQ. Office proce

dures in effect in Director J. Edgar Hoover's office at the time

indicate both proposals were approved by Mir. Hoover,
