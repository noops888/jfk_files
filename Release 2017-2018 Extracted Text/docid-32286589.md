and he would definitely be in touch with subject.

Miami immediately identify, locate RALPH SENTERFEIT

and determine subject's operation with SENTERFEIT.

Miami immediately contact INS. Ascertain address for

RAUL GONZALEZ and thereafter locate and interview him as close

associate of subject.

SUBJECT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED POSSIBLY ARMED AND
