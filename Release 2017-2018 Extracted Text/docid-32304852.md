Re: Corrado POZZA - aka -

Further enquiries regarding Michel POZZA

that he returned to Canada again on 13 MAR 67,

at which time he imported a new Mustang convertible

which he purchased in the U.S. on 18 JAN 67 and on

which he paid taxes and duties to Canadian Customs

in Montreal, amounting to $859.21. The Customs

declaration did not indicate the location where this

vehicle was acquired, however, the vehicle bore

current California l1cence IWS 473, registered to

Michel POZZA of 400 North Martel, Los Angeles,

California.

It 1s requested that the Los Angeles

address be checked out to ascertain the registered

owner of the property and their connection, if any.

with POZZA or any other criminal element.
