This investigation is predicated on information

received from I-1, of known reliability who is an official of

the, Mexican Ministry of Government (Immigration),

effect that EDWARD BROWDER, Jr. had been arrested by Mexican

Immigration Agents at Mexico City on November 28, 1954.

was in Mexico illegally at the time of his arrest and was

considered to be an undesirable resident, it had been determined

that he would be "informally deported" as soon as arrangements

for his deportation could be effected at a minimum cost to the

Mexican Government. I-l stated that BROWDER had been offered

the opportunity of paying his own transportation on any direct

airline flight from Mexico to the United States but that his

efforts

to raise funds for such a purpose had not been successful.

I-I advised that in view of the subject's inability

to secure funds with which to pay his own transportation to the

with a group deportation of other United States Nationals:

by automobile to Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, where his expulsion

to the United States took place to Laredo, Texas, on March 11,

1955.
