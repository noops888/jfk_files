JOHN ROSELLI,

ANTI RACKETEERING

LA 4268-C advised that he observed ROSSELLI at the

Friar's Club in Beverly Hills in the late afternoon of Friday,

12/7/62. ROSSELLI was playing cards with an individual named

SID BARENFELD, brother of JACK BARENFELD, who is known to be

an acquaintance of ROSSELLI and of MAURICE H. FRIEDMAN,

part owner of The New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

On 12/10/62, LA 4268-C was at the Friar's Club,

but RoSSELLI was not there.

Mrs.

IRVING GOTTLIEB, a neighborhood source advised

that she observed ROSSELLI enter his apartment alone about

10:30 PM on Saturday, 12/8/62.

At about 2:00 AM on 12/9/62, SA WILLIAM R. CARTER

observed a 1963 Ford Thunderbird parked in ROSSELLI's stall

at the apartment.

This car had no identification on it except

a license plate holder bearing the name Brand Motors.

LA 4396-C* advised that during the weekend, and

probably Saturday night, 12/8/62, ROSSELLI was in contact with a

girl whose first name is SHARON.

ROSSELLI is apparently having

an affair with this girl as he stated he has had no affairs with

other women since he met her and then accused her of an "arrange-

ment" with some married man. He said he has to see her, but that

no one need know that she sees him.
