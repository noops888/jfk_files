Captioned case was opened on the following

Information, which was furnished on 7/11/58, from NY 169-C:

"Informant advised that he did not know ANITA

LICARI, who resided at 7401-A 74th Street, Brooklyn, but that

he recalled one JOSEPH LICARI, a combination man about 50

years old and a friend of JOE PROFACI.

Informant had not

seen JOE LICARI in a couple of years at this time, but

stated that he came from the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn."

On 4/23/63, NY 169-C was shown a photograph of

GUISEPPE LICARI, FBI

# 337703A, which he identified as

1dentical with the JOSEPH, LICARI, whom he referred to a

combination in 1958.

ch

LICARI as being about fifty years old.

FBI # 337703A, who was identified on 4/23/63, was born

on 10/26/27, and would only be 36 years of age at present.

review of the indices of the NYO reflects reference

to a JOSEPH LICARI, New Haven,-Conn, PD # 83650, who 1s a

close associate of RALPH TROPIANO.

It was felt that inasmuch

as TROPIANO originally came from NY this LICARI might be

Identical to the Individual referred to by NY 169-0 as a

92-2735

By letter dated 5/12/63, the New Haven Division

furnished photographs of JOSEPH LICARI, NHPD # 83650.

These photographs were exhibited to NY 169-c

and he stated that this was not the LICARI referred to by

him.

and JOSEPH LICARI, NHPD # 83650, were exhibited to

NY 3461-C-TE on 6/5/63, and to NY 3864-C-TE on 6/6/63.

JOSEPH LICARIS as anyone known by them.

In view of the difference in the age of JOSEPH

LICARI, FBI # 337703A, and the age of the individual originally

referred to by NY 169-C and the fact that this individual

is unknown to either NY 3461-C-TE or NY 3864-C-TE, it 1s

felt that NY 169-C is mistaken in his identification.

Inasmuch as NY 169-C, NY 3461-C-TE, and NY 3864-C-TE

all failed to identify JOSEPH LICARI, NHPD # 83650, as a member

and the files of the NYO contain no

reference to any other JOSEPH LICARI, who could be identical

with the individual referred to by NY 169-0, this case 1s

being closed.
