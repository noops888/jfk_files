Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in

order to cover three Yugoslav lines.

Two of the lines which were disconnected

were Cuban Embassy lines, both were not in use by the Cubans. One was in

the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by

other Cubans.

The other was a telephone in the Cuban Embassy which was

never answered. The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the

Embassy.

They have also asked for the telephone company to repair 14-92-14.

As soon as these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav

Embassy lines will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish on the

Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and as of 18 and 23

September the Yugoslav lines (three). These transcripts are received each

morning for the day before. During September, the LIENVOY monitors

transcribed 1396 pages in addition to the daily resumen.

The outside translators now working on LIENVOY transcripts are

Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, who is used for almost any backlog which

begins to occur.

David B. SCHLAGETER, field contract agent, who transcribes the

Czech take.

!.

Victor W. OBOLD, career agent, who transcribes the Yugoslav portion

of the Yugoslav take.

Douglas J. FEINGLASS, staff agent, who continues to transcribe the

Russian language portion of the Soviet take.

9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad - Federal Security Police

The principal functions of this security unit are to:

(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,

(2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both

the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and

(3) perform investigations and arrests of primarily political

offenses.

The unit's agents are largely

poorly trained,

insecure, and unreliable.

Their professional characteristics

are best described as being dishonest,

cruel, and abusive.

Director General of DFS is precarious.

MLN, the PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy.

indication of the Mexican government's assessment of the

capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it

is worthwhile noting that Politica frequently experiences a

great degree of difficulty in printing and circulating itself

due to the government's repressive efforts.

11. Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN)

Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,

the MLN today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual

interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the

ranks of the PRI,

the PPS,

the PCM,

the CNC and the UGOCM.

The MLN's objective is to gain leftist political represen-

tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists

into its camp.

As a consequence of this objective, the mission

of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy

by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and

peasant masses.

Confederation of Latin American Workers). Until recently, the
