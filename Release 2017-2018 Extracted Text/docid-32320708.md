Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board

Second Floor

600 E 'Street, N.W.

Washington, D.C.

Dear

Mr. Marwell:

The FBI has

reviewed the Assassination Records Review

Board's proposed regulation published in the Federal Register on

February 8, 1995, and

styled "Guidance on Interpreting and

Implementing the

President John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act

of 1992" (the Act).

That review indicated the need for comments

on the regulation to include suggestions for amending the

language of two of its provisions and a request for clarification

of the meaning of the language in a third. The FBI appreciates

the opportunity to provide these comments to be considered by the

Board before it finalizes the language of this interpretive

regulation.

Before making its comments, the FBI wishes to express

its very strong

and continuing desire to assist the Board in its

effort to identify all records that relate to the history of the

assassination, to include those that may not have been reviewed

by past presidential commissions and congressional committees

established to investigate the assassination of President

Kennedy•

It is indeed through such disclosure of documents that

any questions the public may have regarding President Kennedy's

Subsection (a) of Section

Dep. Dir.

regulation provides that additional records and information which

Chief of

the Board believes are required for it to fulfill its functions
