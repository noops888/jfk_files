Alforte ot Contre to Greate Incidents Discrediting HaS.

By teletype 10/25/59, Miant Office has furnished

information from Mu 639-S (Howord Kenneth Davis, a well-placed

source who has been in close touch with both pro-castro and

anti-Castro forces) which clearly reveals the hypocrisy

of Castro's accusations as well as the Castro regime's

readiness to stoop to any means to discredit the U.S. and

make it appear that this country is to blome for all of

Castro's troubles.

This information hos not been disseminated

as yet in order to afford Director an opportunity to review

it prior to dissemination. lt is, however, being furnished

Police tyigento Almetjetras of cubon National Police.

Bureau Coverage of Cubon Revolutionaru Activities

Co

Intelligence Coverage

Bureau hos investigative responsibility, in two specific

types of cases unich frequently involve Latin American nationals

in U.s. • Registration Act and Neutrality matters:

As will bei

detailed in paragraphs b. and co, there these statutes ore discussed

in some detail, both have definite limitations and me have not confined

our interest or investigations regarding Latin-Americon revolutionary

ectivities to narrow jurisdictional lines. This has been particularly

true in connection with recent developments in Cubo. Since January,

1959, Bureau has put greatly increased emphasis on Cuban matters

and has acted aggressively in effort to collect all available data

in the u.s. beering on the political, economic and military situation

in that country as well as netghboring Coribbean countries:

Among

other things, we have (1) interviewed inconing refugees and defectors,

such as Dies lonz, for any information of interest they might have;

(2) initiated investigations of all leading Cuban exiles ind factions

in Us. even though in many instances no charges of unlowful actruities

or other Jurisdiction existeds

(3) pressed field, and especially key

offices of Miomi, New York one, Havana,

to improve their infoment

coverage in this eld;

f4) placed technical coverages with Attorneyl

General's approval on Cuban Embassy Lashington, D.

and Cuban

Consulates at Micht and New York City.

In addition, we have made increased efforts, wherever

possible, to correlote or "package" the results of numerous individual

investigations and disseminate summary-type reports to other agencies

affording them a better insight into significont trends and a

comprehensive pioture of developments.

Inis effort, as well as our

increased stress on Latin-Americon investigations, is shoun in foot

that since April, 1959, no less than nine issues of our weekly

Current Intelligence Analysis (CIL) letter have been devoted

unole or part to Latin-American motters,

We have also put stress on keeping high-level and policy making

officials of the Government advised of significont developments

concerning Cuba.

In addition to our regular dissemination to the

working levels at State, Central Intelligence Agency and the military

agencies,

on a number of occasions in the post year we hove furnished

the White House, Vice President Nixon, the Secretary of state, and

the Attorney General special reports summarizing significant trends

ene developments relating to cupc and the Caribbean area.
