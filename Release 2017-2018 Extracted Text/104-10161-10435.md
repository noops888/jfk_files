MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

ATTENTION

SUBJECT

: Alien Affairs Staff

: Vladimir RODRIGUEZ Lahera - Admission to the U.S.

of Wife and Two Minor Children

1. Subject is a former staff employee of the Cuban Intelligence

Service who defected to the free world in Ottawa, Canada on 21 April

1964.

Subject had been planning his defection for some time and

accordingly he brought with him a large amount of classified material

which he delivered to this Agency. As a result of his defection the

Agency was the recipient of extremely valuable information on the

Cuban Intelligence Services both in Cuba and in the Western Hemisphere.

Since April 1964 Subject has continued to be of high value to the

Agency and continues

to assist us in every way possible.

2.

It has now been learned that Subject's family (Wife and two

minor children by her first marriage) are expected to depart Cuba

for Mexico on 14 April 1965. In view of the imminent arrival of

Subject's dependents it is requested that entry be arranged for the

family in as expeditious a manner as possible.

While normal entry

can be achieved under section 212(D) (5) of the Immigration and

Nationality act it is felt that due to involvement with the Depart-

ment of

State and the requirement of National Agency Checks, the

admission to the U.S. of Subject's family might be delayed.

3.

The

expeditious, rather than routine, handling of the

visas of Subject's family is of importance for Subject's morale

and because Subject, himself, should spend a minimum of time in

Mexico for security and operational reasons. Further, his proximate

operational use is anticipated and any delays in arranging for entry

of his dependents could result in the delay or cancellation of

planned operational activities.

4. It is, therefore, requested that Alien Affairs Staff

arrange with Immigration and Naturalization Service for the prompt

admission into the U.S. of Subject's family

once they arrive in

Mexico City.
