IE: FLIGHT OF LAIS PERSONALI TO ANGRIGINA

an article woich was publisued in the neaspaper, "El Pueblo

Uruguay,

25, 1944, al-

leged

that nunerous hezd officials vere presentig aiding 1n

Argentina

under ossused identities.

Along the irdividuals

listed as lazi officials were Colonel malter Osusand, Lajor

GensraL nas Steugeen, one DI. Frick, Carlbeinz Von Dufal8

and Gottfried Sandstede.

One of the allegations in this article was to the effect that

Major General rang Steudemann was stupping at tae "dotel Aden",

Calle Malaü 1288, Buenos Aires.

Argentine documents in the nage of Pedro Cassions. Investiga

tion at the "dotel Adun" nas failed to uncover any record of

any individuel named ians Steudenano or Pedro Cassnenn..

record of the issuance of documents in the neme or Pedro

Cessmann bes been located.

One Dio Friek, an

engineer, director of the steel works at

Bochun,

Gerainy,

was alleged to ba living at the

"German Rid-

Ing Club", Calle leneverria, beigruno, buenos Aires, and was

said to visit the Geran Embassy.

was also claired taut

ho was the bearer of a richtenstein passport in the name of

FOUETO BERED.

Investigation at the "Gerzan Hiding Club" 1ndi-

cates that Dr. Frick does not reside taere at the present time:

•The German Embassy in Buenos Aires has been closed since the

severance of relations between toe Argentine and German govern

ments in January 1944 and the Imbassy is guarded trenty-four

hours por dsy by toe Buenos Alres Police Departreat.

No record

of the passport or otner documents in the name of iduard Reden

has been encountered.

Inquiries in German circles in Buenos Aires have developed no

Inforcation regarding any of the individuals alleged by this

article to be seeking refuge in Argentina.

Information as to the original source of this article has not

been developed.

It is believed that the story was originated

hy the Communist Party in Argentina.

It was reprinted in five

clandestine Communist Party newspapers in Uruguay and Argentina.
