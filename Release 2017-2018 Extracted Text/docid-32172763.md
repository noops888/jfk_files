or less ago Made a trip to the

Soviet Union

etc on the

Youth Conference Know as the 'World Youth Conference.'

He wild probably emerge from the New York thing as'a

full time organizer in some special field suchas youth.

At the start of the Meeting Genne brought out

her brief

case full of cliphings. (Newspaper) etc she

also had a lot of penciled notes which she

was

undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing

and to give others hell for not co-operating with her.

But

the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around

the late Pres. Kennedy.

1(4)

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a

Conmunist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

against the c. party of America but by the time the

reactionaries were getting started it was announced

that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the

extreme

fight had been active. This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

C. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme

right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober

the masses that it was the same caliber of people who

had Inulted Stevenson only Weeks before In Dallas, (X(u)

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this

Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he

told them he gets

lots of letters of enquiry about the

C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds

of others and even sent him literature if he requested

it. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with

statement. but. he

stated to them he would have to dig the

letter out and be sure before he Made any statement.

Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson If when he got back to

New York to look in the files if he had a letter from a

Wn Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also an

Inmate

ate of Cambridge Asylum for a period of time, Gordy
