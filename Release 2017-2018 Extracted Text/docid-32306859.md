NY 92-2300

Since the inception of the related investigations pertaining

to the Organized Crime Program one of the primary objectives of

this program was to identify members and positions of leadership.

lo this end knowledgeable Informants were contacted in all

pertinent field offices.

On the whole the informants: supplied

accurate information, which was subsequently verified by

highly confidential sources and by'

member sources but as to the

exact number of LCN members in the U.S. many diverse numbers

were received.

Some

of the figures apeared to be unrealistically

high and much confusion has arisen as to the exact number of

IN members.

Even member sources are not consistent in their

estimation.

As recently as September, 1968, NY 6436-C-TE

(member source) who is an extremely knowledgeable informant was

contacted and opined tat there were 2,000 members in New York

City but 500 were dead.

The NYO can account for over 500 living

members with several hundred known dead but it is exceedingly

unlikely that the NYO will surpass 700 active members.

Therefore,

at this time an attempt should be made to reconcile the exact

membership.

As a point of reference the membership books according to

reliable sources

were closed for all families a short time follow-

ing the Appalachian meeting on 11/14/57. It is conceded that in

a few isolated instances,

for specific reasons,

some members were

admitted, however, the number is relatively insignificant.

Therefore, to come to a determination it will be necessary for

all offices to review their AR files nd list all deceased members

on a separate list.

It is expected that this project can be

easily completed for inclusion into the next LCN National

Summary report in the Fall, 1969.

It is believed that by following this procedure, an accurate

determination can be made as to the approximate number of LCN

members in the U.s.

at it's high point in November, 1957.

Since that time the active membership list would necessarily

decrease primarily because of deaths.

Offices are not necessarily confined to the time of Appalachian

•and

should include the names of persons identified as members

who died prior to this time so that a complete deceased list

will be compiled.
