(OO MIAMI)

Re Jacksonville teletype to Bureau, 8/18/76,

and Denver teletype to Bureau, 8/19/76..

Review of Albany indices concerning names set

forth in referenced communications failed to develop any

positive information with the exception of ICN reports

prepared by the New York Office, which contain references

to CLYDE GEORGE SMALDONE, CLARENCE M. SMALDONE, EUGENE

SMALDONE and PAUL CLYDE VILLANO, all of whom are known or

suspected ICN members within the Denver Division. It is

noted that this same

information was disseminated to both

Miami

and

• Denver.

Albany TE member sources have been repeatedly

contacted regarding captioned matter and AL 3983-C-TE has

advised that RUSSELL A. BUFALINO (BUFALINO ICN Family) knew

the deceased victim very well.

Source was unaware of details

Of BUFALINO and ROSELII's relationship, other than both are

LCN members.

Source advised that the only reference to

ROSELLI'S death was that of ANTHONY FRANK GUARNIERI (BUFALINO

ICN Caporegima), who commented that ROSELLI "probably went

to far," a reference which source assumes was made to ROSELLI's

having testified before the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence (SSCI) •

Contact will be maintained with Albany member
