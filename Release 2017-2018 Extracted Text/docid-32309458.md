In Bayfront Park are dressed in United States Arwy fatigue

suits, wear combat boots, canteen cups, and cartridge belts.

One American Is seen wearing a bayonet tied to his leg in

commando fashion. These Americans have become a problem fos

the Cuban wonen maintaining this vigilance, and are considered

a nuisance to both the women, the police and visitors to Miami's

Bayfront Park.
