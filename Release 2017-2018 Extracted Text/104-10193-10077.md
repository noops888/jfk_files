MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group

SUBJECT:

Promotion of Mr. Calvin W. Hicks

1.. I would solicit Career Management Group. and the Promotion Panel

to consider the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the cur

rent cycle of promotions from GS- 13 to GS-14.

2. After Mr. Hicks EOD in 1950, he advanced rapidly in three years

to GS-11.

He was promoted to GS-12 In 1956, six years later to. GS-13 in

1962, and since then has been almost 12 years In grade... He has had over-

seas tours with FE and NE Divisions, has served as a training instructor, on

a PM task force, and with Miami Ops and area branches in WII. In these

assignments he consistently recelved Strong ratings. Despite a largely para-

military background, in 1967 he adjusted to the intelligence production cycle

and developed the skills of an operations officer doing operations-oriented

reports work in the intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest

continuity in'the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful

Individual who exercises excellent professional judgment. He was recom

mended for promotion from GS-13 to GS-14 in April 1968 and in April 1969.

In 1970 he was recommended for a QSI by Fl Chief, Peer deSilva. He was.

again recommended for promotion in March 1971, In November 1972, and In

November 1973.

3.

Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are rela-

tive and

must be adjusted to the headroom available. The overall history of

his career would seem to argue the equity of granting the often recommended

promotion to Mr.. Calvin Hicks as he nears the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is

49 years old and has a, family of five children. He has a medical hold which

will not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem-

plates rétirement at age 50 (in late 1974). He is and will be until then a

valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.

4. I recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last

decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle.

I would again like to recommend the promotion of subject officer from

Mr.. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967

and his performance has been characterized. consistently. by exceptional profictency.

He serves on a rotating schedule with seven other officers ‹ doing identical work,

some of whom are currently in GS-14.

A medical hold has precluded any further. overseas assignments and for

this reason his stay in Il has been extended until November 1974, when he will

be 50-years-old at which time he plans to retire under the Agency retirement

Mr. Hicks" resourcefulness and ability to apply the multitude of

reporting instructions and techniques have been convincingly demonstrated in

crisis situations such

as the recent Chilean coup and the Middle-Eastern crisis.

crisis with rapid and effective

action and has clearly demonstrated his ability

to continuously adjust to rotating shifts and the irregular flow of traffic.

For his sustained high level of performance in 1972 Mr. Hicks received

a quality step increase in recognition

and as proof of the high esteem in which

he is held by his

superiors.

He occupies a GS-14 slot. His

promotion is again

recommended in recognition of his long years of Agency service.

Mr.. Hicks 1s. one of three officers in the Intel-

ligence Watch,

FI Staff, on whom identical recommendatlong

are being submitted.

These officers, all. in grade GS-i13,

have for several years done responsible

and demanding work,

identical to thnt done in the

same office by five other of

ficers, GS-14 and 15, and

all' three' have been ráted "Strong."

The Intelligence Watch is the primary intelligence

dissemination office.of

the Clandestine Service.

Its out=

put of over 2,000 reports a month is the chief end-product

of CS collection operations.

Watch: Officers serve on a

rotating schedule. When an officer draws the night. shift

he serves alone.

He must make quick, independent dissemina-

- tion décisions.

Mr'. Hicks has done well at this work.

He

is alert and consclentious and has a sharp operational sensé

which is extremely useful in the handling of CS intelligence

information. He has been recommended several times for pro-

motion to GS-14.

The high quality of Mr. Hicks's performance has

continued for more than two years.

• There is no reason to

expect any decline-in 1t." His enthusiasm continues, and

his tour has recently been extended for another two years.

CHIEF, FI/INT/IW

ATTACHMENT

I heartily endorse this recommendation that Mr. Hicks be

promoted to GS-14. As his supervisor points out, Mr. Hicks,

when he came to the Intelligence Watch, was essentially a

guerrilla warfare field operational aficer. Positive intelll-

gence information reporting and the handling of reports were

new to him, and called for professional skills and other

qualities radically different from those which most of his

previous exuerience had brought into play.

Yet in a relatively

short time, Mr. Hicks has developed the skills required of a

Watch Officer, and thanks to this and to other strengths has

become one of the most valuable diicers in the unit.

with diligence and enthuslasm. Even after some protracted sick leave periods he has

returned ready to step. in and pick up where he left off which is the best proof of hts

mastery of details and the mechanics of dissemination, as well as his ability to adjust

to the stresses, and strains resulting from this type of assignment.

Since the Inception of his IW ässignment he has borne the same responsibilities and

carried the same burdens as his colleagues in the GS-14 category and continues to per-

form at this level. For this sustained high-level of performance in 1972 he received a

quality, step increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which he is

held by his superiors.

2 Mr. Hicks:

resourcefulness and ability to apply the myriad of reporting skills and

techniques has been clearly demonstrated. in crisis situations such as the recent

Chilean political. upheaval and the current Near Eastern crisis.

The presence of IN

officers. such as Mr. Hicks enables the DDO to effect electrical dissemination of the

high précedence traffic to the Intelligence Community in a matter of minutes on a 24-

was "granted a Quality' Step Increase: in recognition and as proof of the high esteem

in which heis held by his supervisor in the Clandestine Service.

Mr. 'Hicks' services have been particularly valuable during: this reporting period

because of dopes fücreased concern regarding the strict maintenance of operational

security in the dissemtnation of its intelligence Information. Mr. Micks has been in=

strumental in referring many reports when in the opinion of tw officers, the authen-

tication statement and the manner In which the report is written would help to pinpoint

the source of the information if the report fell in unauthorized hands. Mr. Hicks'

notations on, the Il log cards which record the action taken on each report indicate the

serfousness, In which Mr. Hicks approaches his daily tasks

reminding Divistonal personnel about the essential elements of good reporting and the

need to comply with the prescribed format.

The exercise of good judgment in referring.or consulting on an Intel Cable prior to

its dissemination

to the Intelligence Community is an essential element in the proper

functtoning of this office and upon which depends to a certain extent the Agency's

reputation.

With the retirement and

reassignment of several Il officers during this

reporting

period, Mr. Hicks is now the Il officer with the most experience and continuity on

the

job..

This together with his maturity of judgment and ability to withstand the rigors and

pressures. Inherent in an around-the-clock activity, make Mr. Hicks a distinct asset in

"the unit.

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD.

Course objectives are to aid participante to: learn the managerial theories

contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid

terms: evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action

skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique

for problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization

Custure and Dévelopment.

The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of

level or experience.: A Grid Seminar. is not "taught" in the usual sense. In

-Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective

solutions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly

assessed.

Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveneas.

Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might

change hie own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveners.

managers are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing

themselves.

Thus

About twenty to thirty hours oi study are completed as prework. Insights

gained are deepened and personalised during, the intensive 50-hour Seminar.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate

Aithough Mr. Hicks is an esperienced officer with strong

o1 his present job were a new experience for him, sinco his past

experience has been entirely. in the PM field.

However, Mr. Hicks

adapted well and quickly to the new environment, showod a great

deal of initiative and resourcefulnoss in familiarizing himself

with the work, and by bringing sound operational and administrative

experience to bear, carriod, out his duties in a thoroughly competent

He demonstráted uncommon ability to organizo

In denlings with his associates he exercisod a good

COMMENTS OF REVIEWINO OFFICIAL

Mr. Hicks is a mature and

thoughtful individual who made

the switch

from PM to FI activities at his

field assignment to & WH Station

in the fall of 1966, but for medical reasons will probably be

staying at Headquarters for

some time.

While this restriction

may linit his ability to get that feel for FI field operations

which a Headquarters desk officer should have, he has previous

field experience in a PM capacity to compensate for this.

The diffcrence in the letter rating between this report and the

fitness report does not reflect in any

way on Subjcet's per

originators.

Subject turned in an excellent all-around performance as Chief of

the Headquarters Paramilitary Section supporting Miami Station oporations

He strives hard to do a good job and is most anxious to pleaso his

superiors.

He is aggressivo, and conscientious in, carrying out his

straightforward but ploisant in dealing with collcagues and other

Government officials: determined in resisting encroachments in his area

of authority: and finally he is notivated by strong patriotic ideals.

He is well-informed and competent in paramilitary operations with

• particular gift for forretine out technical improvements and innova

Finally, Subject adapts
