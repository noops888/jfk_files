This is a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance

operation against the PBHUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

two trained, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street from

the target.

The project is in consonance with Pilority A, Objective i, of the

current Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

C.

Background. This project, herewith presented for approval for the first time,

does not represent a new operation.

LIONION activity has been going on since

1962 and costs have heretofore been charged to PBRUMEN FI funds.

Station,

In addition to the identification of staff and visitore, the photos

(accompanied by a log kept by the LIOMiON agents, reveal patterns of action

(arrivals and depertures) and details of personal associations (who associates

with whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations asainst

the target.

In addition to photography, LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 are often called upon

to do visual surveillance of the target installation and LIClION-1 is essentiel

to the dispatching of the LIBRACE surveillance team against individuals

associated with the target.

Because of the presence of police patrol cars in

the vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to the

target, hence the need for LIONION-l's dispatching services.

The presence of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 also Insures continued occupancy of

a valued piece of real estate which will be used as a listening post when the

Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in the

This would probably hold up unless they vere caught in flarmnte

refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.

In any event, LIONION 1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican
