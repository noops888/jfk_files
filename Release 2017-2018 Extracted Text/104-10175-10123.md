Request for Advice on Industrial and Plant Security: Protection

@ Against Terrorist and Bombing Attacks

ACTION RECAARE: - EL SELKOS

1.

You will remember that we were able to provide some

advice on precautions against kidnapping to key members of the

American Chamber of Commerce which resulted see expfessions of:

Fs1, 286 01

Now, {KDACETONE-1 tells me, the police of the

Distrito Federal have increased patrol activities around some

on the basis of supposed information that there are

threats against these firms or that someone plans to

"do something"

Lays 0c-1 2=0520 me a pamphlet picked up during.

the demonstration on 17 May of which I attach a copy.

see from this why the businessmen might be disturbed; the anti-

U.S.-business theme is secondary, in my opinion, and so I told

=CKDUCETONE-1, to the opposition's primary target, the GOs. Also,

I told him, we have no recent or speci ic information of any

group's planning anything against U.S. firms.

(We shall check

"IthIKOGLACIER-S to see it he has anything.)

2. ENACETUNE-I asked me if we had anything on plant pro

tection which he could ciiculate to

the membership in the same

he did our other production.

This would be a pamphlet or a

series of suggestions as to ho a store or factory or office

could take precautions against bomb throwing, boob planting,

incendiaries: and the like.

That is, it need not deal with

other aspects of security against theft and burglarly but with

Tupanaro-style attacks against facilities)

He don't have mEy-

thing of the

sort on hand here and we don't have anyone locally

cxpert in this.

It seems to us

the sort of thing which WOBOSE

night be able

to produce or to get from someone such as the New.

Tork City Police.

You probably have better ideas.

If you send

{LACETONE-i took my composition and used at literally.

let us know what security might be involved:

3. I always feel a bit defensive about these requests:

the easy way would be to tell then to go take care of this

themselves.

It still seers

to me that we can earn or keep

some good will this way as well as actually helping, perhaps,

to prevent unpleasantness.

I hope you can do this without too

much trouble but I do think it is worth some.

Obviously,

group much appreciated their lunch with you early this month
