Dear Mr. Peterson:

This is in response to Senator Dianne Feinstein's July 17th inquiry to the

Department of Justice, which was forwarded to the FBI, regarding your letter to her dated

April 28, 1997.

As stated in your letter, the Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) was

scheduled to be defunct as of September 30, 1997. President Clinton signed a law authorizing a

one-year extension for the Board for Fiscal Year 1998. It is Public Law 105-25. However, due

to other legislation tied into the same bill, the appropriations have not yet been signed
