in Miami,

had informed him that a meeting of 300 persons, mostly Cubans, was

held at 6 p.m. last night at the apartment of an uncle of Rolando

Theard

Ambassador Theard said the Consul General was fearful of an

accempt against his life and requested that he be given protec-

tion. He said that the Consul General requested protection of the

Miami

police last night.

(This information was immediately communicated to Mr. Orrin

Bartlett of the FBI, who said it would be transmitted to the

Bureau's office in Miami.

He said the FBI does not extend protec-

tion and added that Mr.

Maximilien was correct in requesting

assistance from the Miami police. However, the Haitian Ambassa-

dor's request would be. included in the message to the Miami office

as a matter of information.
