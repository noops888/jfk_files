case off James vs. United States, the Supreme Court held that

money obtaineday embezzlement must be reported by the embezzler

in his Federal Income Tax Return for the year in which the

embezzlement took place.

This decision applies only to those

returns filed subsequent to the date of this decision and does

not include, any returns filed prior to May 15, 1961.

In the future when you identify a subject in a

Bureau case involving embezzlement of funds, you should furnish

the necessary information including the name and location of

the embezzler, and the amount of the embezzlement to the nearest

Director of Internal Revenue. This can be done after Bureau's

(HE BANK ROBBERY MATTERS -- In those cases where the initial

teletype to the Bureau in bank robbery investigations sets

forth a succinct summary of the modus operandi and description

of the unknown subjects involved, it is not necessary for

theloffice of origin to prepare a separate memorandum for

assemination of this information to surrounding field divisions.

The Initial, teletype may be utilized for this purpose and

set forth, leads concerning contacts with logical criminal

informants and pertinent police agencies.

In cases where

immediate handling is not required, such

leads may be set

forth by disseminating copies of the initial teletype by mail

or airmail to the surrounding offices:

In those cases where

sufficient information is not available at the time of prep-

aration of the initial teletype to

the Bureau, it will be

necessary for the office of origin to continue the present

practice of preparing a separate communication for dissemination

to surrounding field

divisions.

• All'field divisions must continue to exercise good

judgment in the dissemination of voluminous bank robbery reports

to surrounding offices.

Copies of investigative reports should

not be directed to offices merely because they were recipients

of the modus operandi communication. Reports should be sent

to auxiliary offices only in those cases where they are absolutely

necessary in order to carry. out investigations in the auxiliary

office receiving such a copy.

During the

bank robbery intere pre arent prop rane same me rep ces ain

that he complies with present Bureau regulations prohibiting

inclusion of negative nonpertinent information in the details

of the investigative report. The inclusion of such information

tends to make these reports unnecessarily voluminous and serves

no useful purpose.

(D) FBI LAW ENFORCEMENT BULLETIN - Over the years, the FBI Law

Enforcement Bulletin has been recognized as one of

the outstanding

publications in the law enforcement field. A great amount of credit

for its high standing is attributable to the field offices which

have furnished the Bureau with excellent ideas and suggestions for

articles.

This is a very vital phase of the Bulletin program, and

each SAC should insure that his office is constantly on the alert

for new and unusual ideas and progressive procedures and techniques

which can be used in the Bulletin.

As in the past, three sug

gestions are requested from each field division for

potential

Bulletin articles in 1962 for each state within its territory.

These suggestions should be made in accordance with previous

instructions which are reiterated below, and should reach the

Bureau, Attention: Crime Records. Division, no later than

February 20, 1962.

The proper procedure for Bureau field offices to follow

in connection with articles for the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin

is to submit suggestions for articles together with an explanatory

paragraph or two

stating the nature of the suggested article, who

will write it and the names of the persons and organizations likely

to be mentioned in it. Do not discuss the suggestion with the

proposed author or any person outside the Bureau or submit articles

ready to print.

In either of these latter two cases there is apt

to be considerable embarrassment to both the field office and the

Bureau should it be found necessary to disapprove the suggestion

or the article.

Insofar as diplomatically possible, officers should be

discouraged from submitting unsolicited articles. If you consider

It wise to accept such an article, advise the author that there is

a big demand for the limited space in the Bulletin and that you

cannot promise when, or whether, the article will be published.

If the officer furnishes a suggestion only, send it to the Bureau

•by letter.

An office which has submitted at least three suggestions

during the calendar year will be considered to have fulfilled its

obligations, pending further advice from the Bureau. If one or

more of the

suggestions are approved, the articles

will be ordered

by the

Bureau at such time as they can be fitted into the printing

schedule.

If none are approved, the office will be directed to

submit additional suggestions.

You will be expected to place particular emphasis on

suggesting the best material available in your field office territory.

Bear in mind that there are many police magazines, all searching

with varying degrees of success for articles on the newest and

best techniques and procedures in all phases of police work.. The

FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin should be the first to publicize

these better methods of police work and there is no plausible

excuse for not doing so, considering the widespread contacts

which the Bureau has with all principal police organizations

in

the nation. Whenever a good idea is found, it should be sub-

mitted, regardless of the number of suggestions previously sub-

mitted during the same year.

In developing your suggestions, note the nature and

origin of articles from your territory which have previously been

printed in the Bulletin. If they

have all been written

by members

of police departments, for example, then your next three sug-

gestions should include at least two from sheriffs' offices and

state police.

The objective here is to get a wide coverage of

law enforcement agencies in your territory; do not play favorites.

This does not, however, preclude suggesting another article from

•the same author or police agency provided the suggested article

appears to be of outstanding value:

It is permissible occasionally to suggest an article

from persons who are not police officers in the strictest sense

of the term, provided the article will deal with some phase of

law enforcement.

Examples are articles by game wardens, national.

park officers with police authority, pathologists who have a good

reputation for lending assistance in homicide cases, cattle brand

inspectors, et cetera. • Any

reasonable suggestion will be considered.

The author should be a person of experience and ability

in the field of which he writes. Both he and his organization

should

be of good character and reputation.

Following is a list of types of articles, certainly not.

all-inclusive, which sheriffs, police officers or other persons

in your territory may

be able

write for the Bulletin:

Investigation of arson, homicide, robbery, burglary, sneak thievery,

thefts from trucks and

railroads, auto theft,

counterfeiting, liquor law

vIolations, Iraudulent checks, gambling, traffic accidents and sex

crimes; larceny of

accidents; suicide as a police problem; report writing; use of

motorcycles and horses; police recreational facilities, running

the desk sergeant's office; jail management, successful techniques

or procedures of any kind,

et cetera.

Other ideas may be obtained

by studying the types of articles which have appeared in previous

issues of the Bulletin.

Articles on outstanding investigations which solved cases

of national interest would be most appropriate.

Of course,

such

items could

not be used until final adjudication. Articles

requested by the Bureau should be submitted within 90 days of the

date on which they were ordered if possible. Likewise, you shoul

be alert to keep the Bureau's publication schedule in mina in con-

nection with articles which may have a seasonal slant.

These should

be received at the Bureau well in advance so they may be published

in an appropriate issue.

(F) OMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MU) BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS OF

JUSTICE AND DEFENSE -- The Bureau has noted with concern an increas-

ing tendency in the part of military authorities to circumvent or

in sone instances completely ignore the provisions of the

Memorandum of Understanding as it applies to the prosecution of

military offenders.

There prevails, in spite of

procedures con-

cisely enunciated both in legislation and agreement between the

Departments of Justice and Defense, a deep rooted but erroneous

precept that the right to prosecute military offenders by civilian

authorities is obtained only with the expressed consent and

sanction of the military.

This theory is without foundation and

where it prevails, immediate steps must, be taken to insure it is

discontinued.

Upon approval

August 31, 1954, of Public Law 725, 83rd

Congress, the responsibility of investigation and prosecution of

violations of Federal criminal statutes by Federal officers and

employees was specifically placed in the hands of the Attorney

General and the FBI. It was the intent of Congress in passing

1/2/62

## Page 19

this legislation that FBI jurisdiction not be abridged by any

branch of the Executive including the military.

The MU merely

supplements Public Law 725 and was agreed upon on July 19, 1955,

by the then Attorney General and Secretary of Defense. The

Department of Justice has from the outset held clearly and

firmly to the doctrine of the supremacy of civilian authorities

over the military.. Any deviation from this basic

doctrine by

military authorities is unwarranted. The Department has like-

wise indicated that U. S. Attorneys and their assistants are

bound by Departmental

policy in this regard.

Specifically, the largest area of encroachment by

military authorities upon the Bureau's jurisdiction is in

cases involving theft, fraud, misapproppiation, and robbery of

Government property or funds

where onlymilitary personnel are

involved when such offenses take place on military reservations.

Such violations are within this Bureau's sole investigative

jurisdiction which can only be relinquished with the expressed

consent of a representative of the Department of Justice.

Crimes within this Bureau's primary jurisdiction

occurring off a military reservation will likewise be handled

by this Bureau and prosecuted in U. S. District Court unless

the military personnel involved are engaged in scheduled military

activities or special factors prevail relating to the administration

and discipline of the armed forces.

Again, it is only upon the

discretion of the Department of Justice that an investigation of

such crimes may be undertaken by the military.

Information has been received from the Department

Indicating the Department of Defense has made overtures to amend

the MU, giving primary jurisdiction to the military in cases

involving fraud, misappropriation, robbery and theft of Govern-

ment property or funds where such offenses occur on a military

reservation and only military personnel are involved as principals

or accessories.

In this regard, it was confidentially learned that

the Air Force in particular is displeased with the fact that

during the past year several high-ranking officers were prosecuted

and convicted in U. S. District Court for violation of the Theft

of Government Property Statute.

not adhering to all provisions of the MU. Any deviation from the

(A) PHOTOGRAPHIC MATHERS COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY -- SAC Letter

62-56 (A) dated 10-9-62, set forth basic considerations relative to the use of

color film. Based on experience to date, it is felt the quality of the field

color photography can be improved. Accordingly, the following information

is set forth for your information and guidance.

Ektacolor Professional Film

Type S is the only color film recommended. Ektacolor is a color negative

process from which color prints, black and white prints and color slides can

be made. Kodachrome, Ektachrome and Anscochrome are positive film and

in order to make prints from these, a copy negative must be prepared.

Whenever this is done some quality of reproduction is lost and in addition

more work is involved. The Bureau's Photographic Unit cannot process

' Kodachrome film and if this is sent to the Bureau, it must be processed

commercially, thus wasting time and increasing,costs.:

When taking color flash shots with the Speed Graphic camera,

No. 11 blue flash bulbs should be used."" These can be obtained from the

Bureau or secured locally. If it is not possible to obtain blue bulbs and

clear bulbs are used, then a No. 80C filter must be used over the lens.

To get the most natural color prints, it is suggested that a Kodak

neutral test card (gray card) be utilized. This card should be placed at the

edge of the subject area where it receives the same lighting as the subject

matter. It is required in only one photograph of a particular subject matter

provided there is no change in location or lighting.

If a gray card is not

used, then descriptive data should be set forth in the accompanying com-

munication. The descriptive data should give the color of the background

wall, color of clothing,, color of car, et cetera,

The color exposure data card, the film holder envelope and/ or

the green sheet accompanying each box of film contains all the information

needed relative to exposure settings. After exposure the film should be

promptly forwarded to the Bureau, attention Mechanical Section, with a

notation that it is color film.

Loaded film holders can be retained for that period which is

recommended on the film holder envelope. Loaded film holders should

never be stored in the refrigerator. Film packed in its factory-sealed

container will endure somewhat longer and refrigeration, if available, will

extend the period even longer. Regardless of type of packaging do not

1W 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 31

---

## Page 32

leave film near any source of heat. In warm weather it should be insulated.from

heat and never placed in a closed automobile compartment.

It has been ascertained that many of the 4 x 5 Speed Graphic cameras

are being set incorrectly thereby resulting in poor quality flash pictures:

There is a synchronization lever at the five o'clock position on the shutter.

It has the following markings: OFF, F-X, a red M and a black M. The OFF

position must be used whenever either blue or clear flash bulbs are used.

Failure to set this indicator to the OFF position will result in blank or very

under exposed negatives. The F-X position is used for electronic flash.

The two M positions are used for types of flash bulbs not used by the Bureau.

Always check to insure the lever is in the OFF position when using No. 11

flash bulbs.

Several field offices have inquired as to the availability of Polaroid

Land film holders for use with the Speed Graphic camera. Controlled tests

made at the Bureau have determined that the quality of Polaroid color prints

• is inferior to that of Ektacolor Professional Film Type S. Since in most

instances more than one photograph is required, use of Polaroid film

necessitates photographing the Polaroid print in order to obtain additional

copies. This results in additional expense and, further, prints obtained in

this manner show a loss of detail. Accordingly, the Bureau does not anticipate

purchase or utilization of Polaroid Land film holders for color photography

with Speed Graphic cameras.

(B) PERSONNEL MATTERS - WEIGHT PROGRAM - Certain personnel actions

including promotion matters involving Special Agents and male clerical employees

require commehts from the SAC or appropriate supervisory employee regarding

the weight of the individual or individuals in the recommended action in order

that it can be determined that these persons have conformed to the Bureau's

weight standards. Prior to submitting such recommendations; it will be

incumbent upon the SAC or supervisor to personally observe the employee's

weight recorded on a scale or in the case of Seat of Government and those

offices having Health Service facilitics, to have a nurse's record of the

employee's weight. Thereafter, appropriate comments including the date

recorded and by whom should be made in the recommendation as to the

weight of the individual or individuals involved in the recommendation.

(D) AMMUNITION -- Several field offices are encountering difficulties in

loading and unloading Mid-Range ammunition and are experiencing a number of

misfires in their training program.

This should be called to the attention of

the Firearms Instructor, and should your office have complaints regarding

the performance of our training ammunition, you will advise immediately the

number of rounds misfired or deformed, the manufacturer's name and the

lot number of the ammunition being used. It is important to know the quantity

of the ammunition fired in relation to the defective rounds encountered.

(E) SPEECH MATTERS -- 'All Bureau speakers are reminded of the absolute

necessity of exercising meticulous care in accepting and handling speaking

engagements, especially in sensitive areas involved in racial unrest. Unjustified

criticism was recently directed to the Bureau in connection with a speech

commitment at a segregated school and it can be reasonably anticipated that

close scrutiny will be afforded any such similar speaking engagements in the

future. Tact and discretion must be prudently utilized at all times to preclude

issuance of any statements or remarks that could be taken out of context and

employed to embarrass the Bureau. While the Bureau does not desire any

change in the general policy covering the type of groups addressed, you should

be most alert to avoid situations of potential embarrassment.

communications for the field personnel files of individual employees. Existing

regulations require that copies of data, favorable or unfavorable to the office

or its personnel, should be piaced in files of individual employees. For example,

information in the nature of inquiries or allegations affecting employees which

arise in connection with a substantive case must, in all instances, be completely

included in the individual's field personnel file.

This must be done regardless

of whether or not the inquiry results in administrative action against the employee.

It should be obvious that if this practice is not followed, it will be impossible at

a later date to have the benefit of this information in connection with a review

of the employee's field personnel file.

Make certain all personnel having any responsibility for this

thoroughly understand and abide by these instructions.

facts. It would be highly improper for personal feelings and personal

opinions of the Agent to be related during any proceedings. I desire that

you immediately reiterate to all Agents in your office the present

instructions.

I must insist that testimony of Agents will stand up under the

closest scrutiny.

(C) MAIL COVERS - SECURITY AND CRIMINAL -- Congressional interest

and criticism in the press on the use of mail covers has prompted the Post

• Office to tighten its supervision on the use of this technique. The Chief

Postal Inspector has advised that he is well satisfied with the arrangements

currently in existence between the Post Office and the Bureau and anticipates

no change in procedures being utilized by the FBI.

Upon receipt of a request for a mail cover, the postal official

will now be required to forward the request to one of the 15 regional inspectors

who will issue instructions for implementation of the desired cover. Large

cities, such as New York, Washington, D. C., and Chicago, have regional

inspectors in the city: but a request for a mail cover in a location without a

regional inspector will require forwarding of the request to the nearest

regional inspector lor approval. For instance, a mail cover in Jacksonville

WW 55041 DocId: 32989525

## Page 38

will have to be forwarded to the Atlanta regional office for final action.

The Chief Postal Inspector estimates that no more than two days will

elapse in handling this matter by responsible postal officials.

Each SAC must continue to personally approve all requests for

mail covers. They must be held to the absolute minimum and utilized

only in cases of a most important nature and where it is anticipated

information of value will be obtained. Prior Bureau approval for all

mail covers is still required.

(D) MOTOR VEHICLE SEAT BELT ACT -- Public Law 88-201 was passed by

the 88th'Congress and signed by the President on'December 13, 1963. This law.

requires the Secretary of Commerce to prescribe and publish in the Federal

Register, not later than one year after enactment, minimum standards for seat

belts for use in motor vehicles other than those of carriers subject to safety

regulations under Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act.

This statute makes unlawful the introduction, sale or delivery in

interstate commerce, of any seat belt manufactured on or after the effective

date of this provision which does not meet the prescribed standards.

Although this legislation became law upon its enactment, the statute

states that its criminal provisions shall take effect on such date as the

Secretary of Commerce shall determine, but such date shall be not less than

¿ 180 days nor more than one year after the date of publication of standards by

the Secretary of Commerce.

The criminal provisions under this act carry a fine of not more than

$1, 000, or imprisonment of not more than one year or both.

Although this legislation names no agency to assume investigative

jurisdiction for violations of its provisions, the Department has advised that

the FBI will have investigative responsibility.

The Department states that routine inspection and spot checking of

plants and distributing outlets have not yet been settled, but this matter will

be left within the discretion of the Department of Commerce. The Commerce

Department has been advised by the Justice Department that the FBI will not

undertake such routine inspection procedures. The Department has advised

the Bureau will be informed as the procedures are worked out.

As mentioned above, it is not known with certainty when the criminal

provisions of this law will become effective, it being the responsibility of

the Secretary of Commerce to set up the effective date.

The foregoing information regarding this bill is being set out for

your information in the event inquiries are received in the field. When further

information is received from the Department concerning procedures being

set up by the Commerce Department and the effective date of the criminal

section of this statute, you will be further advised. Until that time, if

inquiries are received

under this legislation they should be referred to the

Department of Commerce.

S) AUIOMOBILES - TIRES -- With the introduction of the 1965 automobiles

the various tire manufacturers are changing over to new "low profile" tire •

sizes. The size 7. 50-14 tire will no longer be manufactured as such and the

corresponding tire in the "low profile" class is 7. 75-14. The new tire will

fit on the present wheels; however, it has a wider tread and cross section and

a shorter sidewall than the 7. 50-14 tire. For this reason the tire manufacturers

recommend these tires be utilized in pairs if all four tires are not the same size,

1. e., both front or both rear tires should be the same size.

Tires presently manufactured and being furnished the Bureau for

replacement purposes are marked as follows as to size: "7.75-14 replaces

7.50-14. "

Accordingly, these new tires should be paired as recommended

when replacements are made. This is of utmost importance during the initial

changeover period.

Thereafter the situation will gradually resolve itself as

all tires on our vehicles are replaced by the new size.

(B) PHOTOGRAPHIC MATTERS -- The Bureau has installed a Xerox Copyflo

continuous printer which produces Xerox prints at the rate of 20 feet per

minute. These prints are reproduced from 16 or 35mm negative roll film

and can be máde up to 11"' wide. The cost of making these prints decreases

with the number produced and based on current production, each copy costs

approximately $. 036, excluding labor. Excellent quality reproduction can be

obtained from written, typed, printed or drawn documentary-type material

but photographs of individuals or scenes (tone photographs) will not reproduce

with any detail or clarity.

If you have any sizeable number of reproactions to make, this

method should receive consideration. In those instänces where a 16 or 35mm

camera is not available to photograph the material, direct a communication

to the Mechanical Section, Administrative Division, setting forth the

• circumstances. If feasible, the Mechanical Section will photograph the

material and provide the necessary negative. Requests for Xerox prints

should be directed to the Mechanical Section.

Those offices using 35mm roll film should note that henceforth the

Bureau will purchase both perforated and nonperforated 35mm film in 100'

rolls only. Neither of these will have the nonsensitized leader and trailer;

therefore, it will be necessary to advance the film far enough to run off the

fogged area. Fourteen complete turns of the crank are recommended for

those cameras which have the crank advancer.

In the near future a self-contained attache case unit will be provided

to most field offices. This is a 35mm camera and takes up to 36 exposures.

It is anticipated that this equipment will be used when a limited number of

documents are to be photographed.

Eastman Kodak Company has advised, effective immediately, all

film packs produced by that firm will contain 16 exposures. Previously the

Kodak film packs utilized in the Speed Graphic and fingerprint cameras

contained 12 exposures. Care and judgment should be used by personnel

using these larger packs to insure that avoidable waste will be eliminated.

desire to continue to keep this function confined to themselves.

Should you desire to delegate authority to the Chief Clerk and

Assistant Chief Clerk, insure that incumbents are adequately familiar with

the procedure for issuing and signing Government Bills of Lading. You should

also insure that both clearly understand the Bureau's responsibility in assuming

transportation costs.

(C) AUTOMOBILES - MAINTENANCE - Several Bureau offices have experienced

difficulty with the steering gear box assembly on the 1962, 1963 and 1964

Plymouths. Inspection indicated the bolts, by which the gear box is attached

to the frame, had worked loose. For the most part this was confined to the

initial period of operation. However in some instances this condition has

recurred. It can be corrected by having the bolts tightened to the factory

recommended torque of 50 pounds. If the condition recurs consideration should

be given to replacing the original bolts with slightly longer bolts in order that

a lock washer can be added.

Recently a Bureau vehicle was involved in an accident due to a

brake failure. Subsequent inspection traced the failure to a defective flexible

brake hose.

As a safety measure in connection with over-all maintenance,

it is desired that a periodic visual inspection be made of the condition of the

steering gear box assembly on 1962, 1963 and 1964 model Plymouths. It

is also desired that the condition of the flexible brake lines on all vehicles,

regardless of make or model, be determined periodically. This can

logically be accomplished each time the oil is changed (4, 000 to 5,000

miles or twice a year) or at other similar intervals if more appropriate

in your division. In accordance with instructions in the Manual of Rules

and Regulations, Part II, Section 7-F, Paragraph 3g, a notation should

be made in the individual automobile file when the foregoing inspections

have been made.

(D) BUREAU APPLIQANTS - SPECIAL AGENT RECRUITMENT PROGRAM -- We

have an urgent need tob additional Special Agents and accordingly, New Agents'

Training Classes have been scheduled to convene March 1, March 29, April 12,

April 26, May 10, May 24, June 14, June 28, July 12, July 26, August 9, August 30,

September 13 and September 27, 1965.

In order to implement this program, every sal should immediate arrange

to appear personally before the senior class of law schools approved by the Anterican ba

Association. Arrangements should be completed by February 8, 1965, unless some dit-

ficulty is encountered. Our needs should also be brought to the attention of SAC contacts

and other logical sources. Constructize efforts should be made to obtain above-average

applicants having a proficiency in a foreign language, qualified in science or accounting:

or qualified under our temporary modified requirements. The Bureau will continue to

offer appointments to those applicants who are found acceptable six months prior to their

availability dates. Each office is expected to recruit a sufficient number of qualified ap-

plicants to enable the Bureau to meet its ever-increasing responsibilities and the failure

to equitably share in this program will result in the imposition of a quota on each office.

Continue to submit on the first and the fifteenth of each month airtel summaries outlining

in detail your accomplishments with respect to the recruitment of Special Agent applican

As I have said on numerous occasions, no work is more important than prop-

erly

interviewing, evaluating and investigating applicants for positions with the FBI. Inte

views and investigations must be exhaustive and designed to uncover any information

bearing on their suitability for Bureau employment.

As you are aware, the interview is

one of the most important steps in the processing of Bureau applicants and the applicatic

is the basis for the interview. The interviewing official should insure that the applicatic

has been completely executed. Be alert for deficiencies such as gaps in employment ans

residence, unanswered questions and incomplete information on relatives.

Fully explore

during the interview information included on the application such as physical defects,

arrests, pending suits, and failure to register for Selective Service.

Naturally, any

questionable items should be specifically commented upon by the interviewing official on

the FD-190 (interview sheet).

An applicant applying under the science program must submit a transcript ci

his college record so that it may be determined whether he qualifies for consideration

under this program. The transcript should be forwarded to the Bureau with the applica-

tion and related papers. Il there is any doubt in the mind of the interviewing official as

whether an applicant applying under our modified program possesses the necessary

qualifying experience, the applicant should be requested to submit, along with his appli-

cation, a detailed resume outlining his experience. There must be no delay in the

processing and submission to the Bureau of the application and related papers.

Prior

to arranging a physical examination, draft or military status shoula be completely

resolved. If applicant has had no prior military service and has been classified 1-A,

2-A, 2-S, I-X, or 4-F, his local draft board must be contacted at the outset to deter-

mine if an occupational deferment would be granted him it offered an appointment as a

Special Agent or, if appropriate, whether the physical defect which resulted in his 1-Y

or 4-F classification would disqualify him for further consideration for the Special Agent

position. If the applicant is a member of a reserve component, it must be determined

whether he is currently a Standby Reservist or would be eligible for transfer to this

category it appointed as an Agent. For your information, Inactive Reserve and Standby

Reserve are not synonymous as members of the Ready Reserve can also be in an inactive

status.

When arranging a physical examination at a Government facility, you should

take the necessary steps to insure that the facility has in its possession all pertinent

information concerning the applicant's medical history, which may have been brought to

light by information furnished by the applicant on his application, or developed during the

course of his formal interview, or by checks of Selective Service records.

If applicant

has been treated for a serious illness or injury by his private physician or in a hospital,

(

irtinent records should be reviewed and the information secured made available to the

examining facility. Such action will permit the facility to make an accurate determination

as to whether or not the applicant can be certified for duty as a Special Agent. Specific

comments should be secured from the examining physician on any defects brought to his

attention. Effective liaison should be maintained with all Government examining facilities

in jour area to insure prompt receipt of oral and written results.

'The investigation of the applicant must be penetrative and every logical

source of information contacted to resolve any information developed affecting his suit-

ability for employment. For example, in veritying an applicant's educational background

do not limit your inquiry to the applicant's scholastic performance. Secure pertinent

information concerning extracurricular activities while in school since this information

will furnish a more complete picture of his suitability for Bureau employment.

Your

investigation in this regard must, of course, include contacts with faculty members and

fellow students whenever possible. Investigations of applicants being considered under

our modified program are to include comments from supervisors and co-workers regard-

ing the exact nature of the applicant's administrative, supervisory or investigative

responsibilities. In connection with a commissioned officer applying under this program,

it is imperative that the Bureau be furnished with comments which appear in his person-

nel folder relating to his performance while in an active-duty status. In cases where it

is developed that an applicant has relatives with present or past questionable reputations,

(* '26/65

NAC LETTER NO. 65-4

## Page 47

their current reputations should be clearly established during the course of your investi

gation. In so doing, you should determine the degree of association and contact between

applicant and these relatives and also the degree of influence exerted on the applicant by

these relatives.

I am not at all satisfied with your accomplishments in connection with the

recruitment of qualified Special Agent applicants from the minority groups. We have a

need for Chinese-speaking Agents who are fluent in either the Mandarin and Toyshan or

the Mandarin and Cantonese dialects. All logical sources; including universities and

military installations, should be contacted in an effort to secure applicants with the above-

mentioned qualifications, and your efforts in this regard are to be specifically set forth

in your February 15 airtel summary of recruitment efforts. You have been previously

advised of the importance of this program and I expect productive results.

In order to meet our goals, it will be the personal responsibility of each

Special Agent in Charge to insure that positive results are obtained. Moreover, the

guidelines set forth above must be meticulously followed. Inadequate investigation and

reporting cause needless correspondence and delay in processing applicationand will not

tolerated. Explanations of Agent and supervisory personnel will be requested and

severe administrative action taken for any derelictions in this regard.

(E) CHINESE ALIENS ENTERING THE UNITED STATES -- Bureau

desires investigations of Chinese aliens entering the United States be

reinstituted. As you know, such investigations were discontinued

by SAC Letter 63-33 dated July 9, 1963. Bureau intends to approach

problem of identifying Chinese Communist intelligence agents through

a program designed to reveal cover stories.

We will

consider for investigation any Chinese alien

entering the United States as permanent resident or

student who meets following criteria:

(1) .

Alien has resided

in or visited Communist China within the past five years; (2).

At time alien last departed Communist China, alien was between

nineteen and forty-five years of age; (3). Alien

had minimum

of eight years of formal education; (4).

At time of entry into

the United States, was unaccompanied by minor children.

Each field office covering an Immigration and

Naturalization Service (INS) District Office, which is a files

control office, will arrange to be furnished the INS file

numbers. identifying aliens meeting the aforementioned four-point

criteria.:

All Legal Attaches should submit background data on

Chinese aliens meeting alcrementioned four-point criteria and

who are granted visas to enter the United states.

While most such aliens will receive visas from the

United States Consulate General in Hong Kong and will be the

responsibility of Legal Attache, Tokyo, the other Legal Attaches

should remain alert for possible Chinese Communist intelligence

agents utilizing third countries to enter the United States.

After pertinent information concerning a Chinese

alien has been obtained from INS or from an office of a

Legal Attache, field office indices should be searched and

the results furnished to the Bureau. The initial letter to

the Bureau from the field in cases originating with

information from INS should contain a dual caption; the

Chinese alien's name followed by the character, '"IS - CH,"

and the second caption should be "Chinese Aliens Entering

the United States, IS - CH." In cases originating with

information obtained by Legal Attaches, the initial letter

to the Bureau should contain similar captions,

The original and two copies of such letters should

be submitted. After initial letter has been submitted, only

original and

one copy of subsequent letters need be submitted

carrying

in the caption only the subject's name and character,

"IS -CH." If Bureau files contain no pertinent information

regarding

the subject, sponsor of immediate relatives residing

in the United States, one copy will be furnished. the office of

origin appropriately

stamped. If derogatory information is

located in Bureau files, such information will be furnished to

the interested office.

Interviews should not be conducted

until the results of Bureau indices check are received.

If

available, the letter to the Bureau should also contain the

subject's name in Mandarin and Cantonese dialects and the

Chinese Telegraphic Code number.

Consideration should then be given to interview of

subject®

Bureau authority will be required for interviews of

subjects and their sponsors when subject or sponsor is employed

in news media, entertainment, public, educational or religious

fields or is a labor leader or prominent person. Similarly,

Bureau authority will be required if subject or sponsor is

student at an institution of learning; when a Congressman has

shown an interest in the subject; or when there is some

indication the subject is an intelligence agent. If interview

is conducted, it should have as primary objective the obtaining

of completely detailed background information.

You should

attempt to obtain that type of information which normally

would be falsified in preparation of a cover story. The

most effective cover stories are those which contain as few

falsifications as possible.

Therefore, interviewers should

concentrate on those facts which must be falsified, namely

those periods when training and instructions were received

in intelligence operations Upon completion of interview

and if no further investigation is indicated, the gase should

be closed. The investigation preceding the

interview shoulc

be held to an absolute minimum.

At the end of a year, the case is to be reopened

to determine subject's employment and residence, and logical

security informants should be checked for information.

If

no derogatory datà develops,

case should be closed and reopened

at the end of another year.

The second time the case is reopened, investigation

should be brought up to date. The investigation should

cover

the subject's activities and contacts for the intervening

period between the first interview and the contemplated

second

interview.

If there is a reasonable possibility that the alien

could be a Chinese Communist intelligence agent, a second

penetrating interview should be conducted.

Specifically, this interview should cover all the

significant data

furnished in

the first interview. If a cover

story is involved, a reinterview after two years should disclose

significant discrepancies in

the facts related by the alien

during the two widely separated interviews. Obviously,

thorough, complete and well-planned interviews are an integral

part of

this program.

In the event an interpreter is required, a Bureau-

approved interpreter must be used if available.

the subjects' sponsors, close relatives or qualified inter

preters from other United States Government agencies may be

used for exploratory interviews.

Field

shouid maintain a control file for this program

and Bureau must be advised of final disposition of all cases

opened. Appropriate Manual of Instructions revisions are being

prepared.

(B) TECHNIQUE FOR TRACING STOLEN GASOLINE -- The Laboratory

has devised a new technique for tracing stolen gasoline particularly in

Thet

of Government Property type cases.

In the past it has been necessary to test a considerable quantity

of gasoline which has beén tagged with phenolphthalein solution in order to

conduct appropriate tests. This new device which is a small plastic squeeze

bottle with a tube attached accomplishes the same job more efficiently and

expeditiously, In the cap of the plastic bottle is a small detector disk

which is chemically impregnated. By inserting the tube into the gas tank

the suspect gasoline is drawn into the bottle through the white detector disk.

If any of the tagged material is present it will cause a pink discoloration

on the disk. This is a simple operation which can be accomplished in a

matter of seconds and is vastly superior to previous methods.

As in the original technique for the tagging of gasoline (FBI

Law Enforcement Bulletin, November, 1954). the tagging chemical will

be a solution of phenolphthalein in ethyl alcohol or methyl alcohol. For

each 10: 000 gallons of gas to be marked one pint of the tagging chemical

will be added, for each 5. 000 gallons of gas; 8 ounces or one-half pint;

etc. Adequate. mixing of the tagging chemical and the gasoline is essential.

. So, where possible; the tagging chemical should be poured slowly in

small amounts at intervals into the storage tank at the time new gasoline

is being added.

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 51

---

## Page 52

The tagging solution will be included in the gasoline testing

kit, two photographs of which are attached.

From actual tests, it has been found that no damage will be

incurred by the engine using fuel tagged by this method.

It is requested that each field division advise the Bureau,

Attention: FBI Laboratory, of the number of kits required consistent with

the potential and needs of each office. Consideration should be given to

the number of Government installations within the field division and past

experience with gasoline thefts. You should also consider the fact that

this technique could be of assistance in bringing to light offenses which

hitherto went undetected.

Your reply with respect to the above is requested by April 16,

next.

(C) TRAINING - POLICE

A RESERVE AND AUXILIARY POLICE --

Bureau has learned the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) is intensifying its

efforts to help local governments train people in disaster techniques so

they may be utilized as auxiliary or reserve police in the event of an

emergency. Matching Federal funds will be available for police training

in civil defense requirements and for civil defense identification or

insignia. In the near future, OCD will distribute a basic and advanced

police instructors guide and an advanced police students manual covering

police services required to cope with conditions during a civil defense

emergency. Allegedly, these matching Federal funds will not be avail-

able for the purchase of police equipment such as batons, helmets,

firearms, etc. OCD plans that all training shall be given by the local

law enforcement agencies involved.

Bureau policy with respect to the training of auxiliary or

reserve police remains as set forth in the pamphlet entitled "Bureau

Policies, Rules, Regulations and Instructions Concerning Field Police

Schools"; namely, we will furnish no training assistance to such groups

other than a lecture on our work and jurisdiction and the use of our

training films.

(D) FUGITIVE INVESTIGATIONS -- There has always been a hard core of

Bureau fugitives capable bif and willing to take desperate measures to evade

apprehension. Previous SAC Letters on lugitive matters brought this to

your attention. This potentially dangerous fugitive group has been sub-

stantially enlarged with the general increase in criminal activity and the

Bureau's expanded jurisdiction, which has resulted in an ever-increasing;

volume of fugitive cases.

Several recent apprehensions have'highlighted the need for

careful preparation in the pursuit of fugitive leads. Serious consequences

to Agent personnel have been averted due to deçisive, courageous action

taken under extremely adverse circumstances. Detailed careful planning,

full knowledge of the fugitive's background, current precise physical

description with recent good-likeness photograph of fugitive, and utilization

of sufficient manpower should serve to cut down on the frequency of

emergency situations which might give temporary auvantage to the arrestee.

•It is felt that the following specific examples will serve to

be of considerable benefit in the investigation and planning of arrest

situations. In one case where the suspect was in possession of identification

showing him to be anöther individual, an Agent sought to establish an

identity by tattoos on suspect's arms. On the request of Agent to remove

sleeve of jacket for inspection of forearm for tattoos, the suspect mani-

fested a willingness to comply but when the arm was removed from the

jacket sleeve the Bureau Agent was confronted with an automatic weapon

in his hand... Quick, courageous action on the part of the Agent in the

execution of a disarming technique while the subject's attention was

temporarily distracted prevented the suspect from carrying out his avowed

intent to kill the Agent.

In another case while two Agents were seeking to identify a

person reported possibly identical with an Identification Order fugitive,

the suspect who was employed in a hospital produced a weapon from a

hospital garment pocket. Here again aggressive, determined, courageous

conduct on the part of the apprehending Agents subdued the fugitive, although

one Agent did sustain a gunshot wound. In a third case involving investi-

gation in a remote rural area, a bank robbery fugitive who had assumed

the identity of a farmer was fortuitously located while walking on a country

road with hands in pockets.

Immediately upon realization that he was being

approached by law enforcement officers he removed one hand from pocket

which contained a weapon. He also indicated his intention to kill the Agent.

Another bank robbery fugitive, when Agents approached to make an

apprehension, fired at the Agents before being apprehended.

There have been a number of instances where weapons have been

found on the person or in close proximity of the arrestee. Frequently,

these individuals have indicated that had they the opportunity the firearms

would have been used to resist arrest.

This is being brought to your attention in order that you will

carefully consider each and every arrest situation. It has been the Bureau's

experience that the case classification is not always a proper criterion

to evaluate the dangerousness of the subject. It has been found deserters,.

check passers, and even persons being sought for crimes against property

are extremely dangerous when confronted with the loss of liberty.

The continuing over-all increase in fugitive accomplishments,

including prompt apprehensions which have been obtained in a large number

of cases involving badly wanted persons, who in some instances have

assaulted or killed local officers, testifies to the enthusiastic, aggressive

and thorough manner in which Agents are approaching these investigations.

I desire that Agents conducting fugitive investigations be made aware of

my views, together with the admonition to thoroughly develop such investi-

gations, carefully plan steps to check out a suspect or to arrest a subject

and to not drop their guard even for a moment during the execution of

their assignment. By doing so, we should be able to continue the excellent

progress which has been made and, at the same time, maintain maximum

protection to innocent individuals and to our personnel.

with the Internal Revenue Service and on several occasions representatives of

that agency have offered testimony concerning alleged use of technical equipment

by the FBI and even, in one instance, alleging that an FBI field representative

trained an IRS employee in the technique of wire tapping.

technical equipment and strong policy controls have been maintained by the Seat

of Government. It is imperative that such controls be continued and that no

discussions ensue with persons outside the FBI relative to the use.or maintenance

of technical equipment.

You should be most circumspect to avoid any collaboration with other

agencies in the technical field which would give rise to further needless testimony

GALLUP POLL RE FBI -* On August 8, 1965, the Gallup Poll published

results oi a recent survey of public opinion regarding the fBI. A copy of this

poll is attached. While the poll results are generally highly favorable, it is

noted that large segments of the public are still unfamiliar with or confused

about FBI jurisdiction. SAC's should seize every opportunity to clarify these

deficiencies in their public contacts. Agents, during the regular course of

business, should also overlook no chance to educate the public and enlist citizen

cooperation. Suggestions of means to rectify the apparent lack of knowledge on

the part of many members of the public are desired and each oifice should

submit recommendations to the Bureau, "Attention: Crime Records Division, "

(*) CHINESE COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN.U. S. RACIAL MATTERS -- Recent

pronouncements of the: Chinese communist (Chicom) leadership and government

broadcasts emanating from Peking clearly point out the desire of that government

to promote and abet racial strite in this country,

Because this presents such an extreme threat to the internal security,

every Agent should be constantly on the alert for information relating to such

activities and should immediately advise the Bureau upon receipt of such

information. Informants should be developed who can uncover activities of

this nature and penetrate any foreign involvement in the U. S. racial situation.

Conversely, such informants should also be considered for assistance in

uncovering and penetrating Chicom intelligence activities directed against the

• United States.

In order to assist Agents handling Chinese and related investigative

matters in analyzing and evaluating their individual cases, the Bureau will

soon commence publication of a "Chinèse Intelligence Bulletin" which will contain

valuable information relating to Chicom efforts; techniques, weaknesses, et

cetera, throughout the world.

Any information relating to this situation should be submitted under

the caption "Chinese Communist Activities in U. S. Racial Matters."

(F) SURVEILLANCE PHOTOGRAPHY MATTER - The Bureau has for several

years made available to the field an ultra high speed film for surveillance

photography in low light level/situations such as a dimly/lighted street or entry

way at night. Originally this was Eastman Kodak Royal-X Recording film which

has now been replaced with Eastman Kodak 2475 Recording film. The 2475

Recording film has increased speed in incandescent illumination due to increased

sensitivity of this film to red and infrared illumination. If the source of the

illumination is incandescent the normal speed rating of the film is ASA 1600

(Tri-& film normally supplied to the field is ASA 400) but if the source of the

illumination is fluorescent the rating is ASA 1200. By extending processing

time for this illm the speed rating may be increased as much as AsA 4000 to

ASA 10, 000 depending upon the subject matter, light direction, etc. It is

recommended under adverse lighting conditions that the meter be set for an

index of 4000 and that the film be developed in DK 50 developer at 68 degrees

Fahrenheit for eight minutes.

This processing of the film will produce

maximum film density. Normal processing for this film is five minutes in

DK 50 at 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

There should be constant agitation during

the processing and the film should be handled only in total darkness.

To make use of the maximum potential of the 2475 Recording film

the exposure and development must be fitted to the subject type and lighting

conditions. Ordinarily this can best be determined through test exposures made

at the scene. However, in emergencies, meter readings made with a Gossen

Lunasix light meter set as indicated above shouid provide good indications of

necessary camera settings and processing time.

Because of the extreme sensitivity of the 2475 Recording film, it

is imperative that the film be loaded into the camera and unloaded from the

camera only in total darkness. The 35mm film cassettes should not be removed

from the cans in a lighted room prior to loading the film into a camera and

should be replaced in the can in the dark at the time the camera is unloaded.

Eastman Kodak's 2175 Recording film is a special order item and

is not available through local suppliers. The Laboratory maintains supplies

of both 16mm and 35mm sizes and will furnish required amounts on request.

If special handling and processing cannot be arranged locally, film may be

forwarded to the Laboratory for processing. Furnish details of conditions under

• WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

October 3, 1967

(AY TRINING - POLICE & I have been concerned about the mounting ;

Crime rate and what ly

/'enforcement in the United States can do to

reverse this undesirable trend. All of the causes of crime in this

generation have not been identified to date, despite tremendous public

and private research in this field. Certainly there are some causes

of crime, particularly those in the socio-economic area, which law

enforcement as a group can do very little about. I feel,

however, that

since the American police service represents the first line in the war

against crime, an over-all increase in law enforcement effectiveness

would have an appreciable effect on the crime rate. I believe our field

police instructors can provide a noteworthy contribution in this regard

by emphasizing the following factors during field police training schools:

1. The effectiveness of police investigative, patrol, and

other line functions must be increased. This means not only affording

the individual officer adequate training in how to do the job, but also

motivating him to the point where he strives for individual excellence

in his performance.

2. There must be an improvement in police supervisory. and

management techniques to enable proper and close supervision of operating

personnel. Selection procedures must be strengthened to insure only

the best enter the police service and controls such as inspections must

be designed to aid in obtaining high productivity and adherence to

departmental rules and policies.

As you know, the latest management

techniques are being given to local law enforcement administrators by

field instructors and by management instructors from the Training

Division. There must be more emphasis and training in the vital areas

of supervision and administration. In scheduling schools for command

and administrative personnel, you should not overlook the desirability

of using outstanding instructional personnel from business, industry

and the educational field. All of our advanced training must be on a

highly sophisticated basis.

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525. Page 70

---

## Page 71

3. There must be high standards of ethics and integrity

prevalent in all ranks of law enforcement. Corruption at any level of

a law enforcement agency may completely defeat the attainment of the

agency's objectives and goals. We should take advantage of every

opportunity in field police training schools to stress the importance of

ethics and integrity and, where appropriate, separate lectures should

be afforded on these topics.

We are living in a time when the average citizen is becoming

more and more concerned about crime and the efficiency of law enforce-

ment. Training is a proven important factor in upgrading the quality

of police service. Every police instructor should recognize his

responsibility to improve law enforcement effectiveness through his

personal efforts.

SAC LETTER 67-59

B) TRAMING - SPECIALIZED PHOTOGRAPHIC -- The FBI

Laboratory, in the near future, will conduct additional specialized

photographic schools for the purpose of making available to all head-

quarters cities an agent trained in specialized photography. Upon

justilication, such training will also be provided to additional agents

in larger headquarters cities as well as other areas where past

experience and kinds of work handled indicate potential need for such

agents.

You are reminded that specialized photographic training

furnished by the Laboratory includes work with long-range lenses,

remote-controlled cameras, camera concealments, darkroom procedures

as well as nighttime, crime scene, color, document and related photo-

graphic problems.

Classes are scheduled for two weeks each, conducted

at Bureau Headquarters, Washington, D. C.., and at the FBI Academy,

Quantico, and confined to six agents each in order that equipment and

darkroom space for practical work will be available.

Each SAC should re-evaluate his current needs for agents

with this training.

In this regard, agents trained only in surveillance

photography (1963-64 series of schools) should not be considered fully

trained in making this evaluation and these agents may be recommended

10/3/67

SAC LETTER 67-59

- 2 -

NW 55041 - DocId:32989525, Page 71

## Page 72

for one of the pending schools provided they otherwise qualify. Keep in

mind that properly trained personnel is necessary to effectively operate

much of the highly sophisticated photographic equipment and to apply

the photographic techniques that are available today. Agent personnel

not trained in this specific area cannot adequately handle the non-

routine photographic assignments nor recognize the potential of such

applications. Also, the effective applications of photography in locating,

recording, and retaining all kinds of evidence as an important law en-

forcement tool take on added importance in the face of the increase in

crimes in all categories and in view of the increased limitations placed

by the courts on the use of certain kinds of evidence.

Each SAC should recommend only agents qualified and avail-

able to receive this specialized training. Set forth basic qualifications

for agents named including prior experience or work in basic photography,

aptitude, interest and patential future tenure in the Bureau's service.

Any office that does not have an agent qualified to receive the training

described herein but has a need for such an agent, should set forth this

fact. If agents are available with outstanding qualifications for this

training but are not needed for this specific purpose in their respective

offices, these should.also be named so that consideration can be given

to providing them with such training in light of the Bureau's continuing

(C) VETERANS ADMINISTRATION MATTERS -- The Veterans'

Pension and Readjustment Assistance Act of 1967 became Public Law

90-77 on August 31, 1967, and provided increased allowances and

certain additional benefits for veterans who had served in the military

services for ninety days or more beginning August 5, 1954.. These

provisions are to become effective October 1, 1967. This law deals

mostly with increased allowances for disability compensation, pension

payments, and educational allowances for veterans of the military

services since the beginning of the Vietnam Era. It extends the

eligibility period for World War II veterans relative to obtaining

Veterans Administration guaranteed home loans to July 25, 1970.

It also provides new training benefits for veterans. Eligible

veterans will be able to take flight training, on-the-farm training in

conjunction with farming courses at approved educational institutions,

and on-the-job training through approved apprenticeship or training

programs. Veterans taking advantage of these benefits will receive

allowances from the Veterans Administration for up to thirty-six

months of training.

Since these increased allowances and new benefits expand

the areas of possible fraud, you should insure that your liaison with

the regional offices of the Veterans Administration is such that vio-

lations involving false statements and false claims by veterans,

employers or educational institutions relative to these allowances and

benefits are promptly referred to your office. Such violations will

continue to be prosecuted under the false claim and false statement

statutes, Sections 287 and 1001, Title 18, United States Code,

respectively.

In the future, cases in this classification are to be carried

under the single character Veterans Administration Matters, inasmuch

as a dual character to indicate the act under which the cases arose no

longer serves any useful administrative purpose to the Veterans

Administration or to the Bureau.

The above will be incorporated in a revision of the Veterans

Administration Matters sections of the FBI Handbook and Manual of

Instructions which are being prepared.

(D) CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - ACCOMPLISHMENTS -- Increased

investigative responsibilities dictate that our accomplishments show a

comparable gain:. Fiscal Year 1967 yielded an all-time high of 13, 032

convictions resulting from our investigative efforts. The many

• obstacles confronting us, such as crowded court conditions, shortages

of judges and prosecuting attorneys, require us to take. every logical

step to insure our accomplishments are depicted in the most favorable

form.

Toward this end, the Bureau solicited the observations of

field offices which had contributed substantial conviction gains during

Fiscal Year 1967 in order to analyze the results and determine what

steps, programs and procedures were utilized by them to achieve their

success. Upon review of the replies received, the general underlying

theme was that each of these offices immediately recognized cases with

prosecutive potential and followed these cases aggressively up through

the prosecutive stage. In addition, these offices felt that the results

obtained were due to a large extent to the excellent liaison and close

rapport they had maintained with the United States Attorneys and their

staffs. :

There follows a summary of some of the methods utilized

by these offices during Fiscal Year 1967 which may merit your con-

Sideration and appraisal within your own field office as a means to

obtain greater accomplishments:

i. Extensive use of police training programs to educate

local police officers as to our investigative jurisdiction. These schools

were also, usea as a means of restoring the confidence of local police

through legal matter courses so that they are familiar with the legality

of arrests and searches, thereby insuring the acceptance of these local

procedures should the case be tried in Federal Court.

2. A revitalized criminal informant program which not only

creates more cases within our jurisdiction, but furnishes information

which will give proper direction to those cases under investigation.

3. Assurances by the Special Agent in Charge that he will

supply "stop-gap" manpower to certain Resident Agencies when they

become involved in time-consuming prosecutable cases.

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525

Page 74

## Page 75

4. Creating a "score card" system within the field office

which is made available to all Agents so that a competitive spirit is

aroused.

5. Proper indoctrination and training to insure that Agents

presenting cases to United States Attorneys are fully armed with all

the vital facts and that these presentations are carried out with the

Bureau's best interest in mind. In this regard, some offices have

successfully utilized selected personnel to handle all presentations.

6. In some instances, these offices noted that Assistant

United States Attorneys either through timidity or lack of experience

do not render prosecutive opinions. In such situations, these offices

suggested to the United States Attorney that he present the facts to a

grand jury if one is sitting in the immediate future, thereby precluding

him from having to make a decision in the matter.

7. Making certain that Special Agents are specifically as-

signed liaison with sources of cases and insuring that regular contact

is made so that matters within our jurisdiction are promptly referred

and investigation immediately instituted where cases have prosecutable

potential.

The above data is being furnished for your information and

guidance and these observations should be borne in mind by you and

your supervisory staff. I cannot overemphasize the absolute necessity

for each office to contribute equitably to the Bureau's accomplishments

and you will be held personally accountable for this important phase of

the operations of your office.

(E) MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE DEPART-

MENTS OF'JUSTICE AND DEFENSE RELATIVE TO THE PROSECUTION

OF MILITARY OFFENDERS - THEFTOF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY -

CRIME ON GOVERNMENT RESERVATION -- SAC Letters 63-10 (C)

dated 2-2:6-63, 62-1 (F) dated 1-2-62, and 60-57 (H) dated 12-13-60,

emphasized the need to adhere to the provisions of the Memorandum of

Understanding (MU) and to be certain that the military did not encroach

on our jurisdiction in regard to investigation of military subjects

particularly in Theft of Government Property (GP) cases.

A number of recent incidents indicate a need to once again

emphasize that the spirit and letter of the MU clearly give the FBI

primary investigative jurisdiction in all but minor TGP and related

violations whether involving civilian or military offenders or both.

The MU specilically requires the military to advise the FBI of TGP

and related violations involving military subjects. However, the MU

also permits the military to investigate such matters unless the

military receives prompt advice that the FBI will undertake the

investigation.

When the case is one that the FBI should investigate, you

should promptly advise the military that the FBI will assume investi-

gative jurisdiction. There should be no need te consult the United

States Attorney in each and every instance before accepting jurisdiction

from the military as the MU specifically states, ".

'... decisions with

respect to the application in particular cases of the provisions of the

Memorandum of Understanding will be made... between... the local

office of the FBI and the local Military Commander. " You should,

of course, maintain close liaison with the United States Attorney and

consult with him in particular cases when such action is desirable.

Note, however, that in some instances, for example, embezzlements

of Government property, the seriousness of the violation may not be

known at the outset and any discussion with the United States Attorney

prior to investigation may be premature.

While you should continue to be alert for deviations from the

MU by the military, you should also be alert to the necessity of taking

positive action when a United States Attorney or one of his assistants

renders an opinion not in accord with the MU.. You should, of course,

10/3/67

SAC LETTER 67-59

- 7-

• NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 •Page 76

---

## Page 77

make every effort to resolve these matters on a local level. Recently

two offices that received an opinion from an Assistant United States

Attorney which was contrary to the spirit and letter of the MU arranged

a conference with the United States Attorney and appropriate members of

his staff. In both instances, the United States Attorneys agreed that their

offices had not handled the matter properly and promised full compliance

with the MU in the future.

The MU was designed to give general guidelines in areas

where the Departments of Defense and Justice have concurrent investi-

gative and prosecutive jurisdiction and each case is to be decided on

its own merits within these guidelines. However, if a military offender

is involved in a serious theft of Government property or similar vio-

lation, there is no doubt but that primary investigative jurisdiction

is with the FBi. It should be a rare case with exceptional circumstances

before this jurisdiction is turned over to the military.

During recent years, there has been a substantial increase

in Government spending both at home and abroad. Agencies such as

the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Defense Supply

Agency (DSA) are custodians of millions of dollars worth of Government

property. Some recent FBI investigations have shown that large-scale

theft ring's are operating at various Government supply facilities and

not infrequently the victimized agency is unable to state how much or

what kina oI property is missing. this and related problems are

currently being discussed with GrA and the Department of Defense at

the Headquarters level. The Bureau desires to know of any instances

Where inadequate record keeping or ineffective inventory procedures

are hampering the investigations of these cases.

Each office should reappraise its investigative program in

the TGP field to assure that liaison and informant coverage are

effective and that violations are being thoroughly investigated.

The above should be brought to the attention of appropriate

personnel.

(F) CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT

PROGRAM -- Information has recently been received indicating a former

target for development in the Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program

has been providing information regarding crime conditions to a writer

who is preparing a magazine article. Prior to the receipt of this data,

contacts with him were discontinued when it was ascertained that he had

breached his confidential relationship with the Bureau.

This serves to emphasize the urgent need for all Special

Agents to exercise the utmost care and discretion in attempting to

develop informants. You are reminded that all interviews with potential

informants must be handled in a circumspect manner which will preclude

the possibility of embarrassment to the Bureau.

These instructions in no way lessen your responsibility.to

insure your office has a continuous and well-planned program to

broaden your informant coverage. To enable the Bureau to meet its

heavy commitments, the development of additional informants is

mandatory.

Your efforts to expand informant coverage must be

characterized by good judgment on the part of all Special Agents.

- These instructions should be brought to the attention of

appropriate personnel.

(G) INTERVIEWS WITH POTENTIAL WITNESSES IN SEDITION CASES --

The Departnient has requested that all Agents who may hake occasion

to interview potential witnesses in matters involving violations of the

sedition statutes be instructed not to ask persons being interviewed

whether they recall any remarks of a subject which they believe may

be construed as counseling draft evasion or obstructing the recruiting

service of the military. The Department indicated that this request

was being made to eliminate insofar as possible having the opinions

and conclusions of potential witnesses appear on the Interview Report

Form (FD-302) which might eventually be introduced in court.

You should bring the foregoing to the attention of all Special

Agent personnel in your division and instruct them to comply with the

Department's request. However, if an individual being interviewed

volunteers an opinion or conclusion or offers any information which

would be favorable to a defendant, this information, as well as unfavor-

able information developéd, should be recorded on the Interview Report

Form in accordance with existing Bureau policy. Such/information

shouid be clearly set forth in the Interview Report Forn as an opinion

or conclusion voluntarily offered by the person being interviewed.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

April 23, 1968

(A) BIENNIAL REPORT ON VOLUME OF RECORDS - FEDERAL

RECORDS ACT OF 1950 -- Re SAC Letters 66-34 (C) and 66-81 (C).

In accordance with the Federal Records Act of 1950,

the Bureau is required to furnish on a biennial basis each even-

numbered year a statistical summary of its records holdings to

the Department of Justice for submission to the National Archives

and Records Service of the General Services Administration.

In order for the Bureau to compile this summary,

each office and Seat of Government division must furnish the following

statistics in the order set forth below:

(1) Volume of records in cubic feet on hand as of 7-1-66;

(2) Volume of records in cubic feet on hand as of 6-30-68;

• (3) Volume of records in cubic feet disposed of during the

two-year period 7-1-66 to 6-30-68.

These figures should include the space reacquired as.

a result of conversion to shelf filing as well as space reacquired by

destruction of record material. All records must be taken into

consideration. Examples of nonrecord material which need not be

considered are preliminary work sheets, ticklers, reference books, etc.

During the perioa 1-10-67 to 2-20-67, all Offices and

divisions at the Seat of Government participated in a "Cleanout Campaign"

as described in SAC Letter 66-81 (C). During that campaign, volume of

both "record" and "nonrecord" material destroyed was set forth; however,

only the volume of "record" material destroyed during that campaign should

be included in the statistical summary to be submitted..

Desired statistics should be furnished to Bureau, attention

Records Branch, no later than 7-5-68. It is not necessary to wait until the

close of the fiscal year to make the above computations.

(C) SURVEILLANCE PHOTOGRAPHY - MOTORIZED SEQUENCE

CAMERA APPUICATIONS - Your attention is directed to some recent

operated as a remote sequence camera when used with an available

electric motor accessory. The Beattie-Coleman 35mm camera is

also available. This camera is built specifically for such use and is

available with a sound-proof jacket which provides for secure in-

stallations.

One office was recently successful in obtaining photo-

graphs of approaching automobiles along a busy highway at speeds as

high as 70 miles per hour with sufficient definition to clearly read

license plates. Even though the photography was conducted from a

moving vehicle, it had to be done discreetly due to the natüre of the

case.

To accomplish this photography, a Beseler Topcon 35mm

camera with a motor attached was mounted in front of the radiator

back of the front grill of the vehicle with a remote operating cable

wired to the passenger's side of the dash. For this photography, the

camera was equipped with a 58mm 12. 8 Topcor lens set at a focusing

distance of 30 feet and Eastman Kodak Tri-X film was used at a

shutter speed at 1/1.000th of a second. The lens'

diaphragm opening

(f-stop) was set appropriate to the light available based on exposure

meter readings.

Camera installations such as that described above could

also be used to obtain identifiable photographs of individuals along a.

street under certain circumstances and might be particularly useful

for discreetly photographing a subject at night in the headlights of a

vehicle.

In another application, the Topcon camera with motor

was used through an altered back-up light lens of an automobile. In

this application, the camera was operated by an Agent in the trunk

of the automobile. This general technique has been used previously;

however, the motor attached to the camera enabled the operator to make

a larger number of exposures within a short period of time and also

allowed more time for observations since less time had to be devoted

to the mechanics of operating the camera.

A Beattie-Coleman camera was used recently concealed

within a filing storage case to obtain up-to-date photographs of all at-

tendees at a convention of the Young Socialist Alliance. In this appli-

cation, with the hotel's cooperation, the filing storage case containing the

camera was strategically placed back of the registration desk and

remotely operated by Agents positioned at another point out of view.

Excellent photographs were obtained of all participants even though

the hotel lobby lighting was poor.

Motorized sequence cameras have in the past also been

installed to photograph subjects involved in thefts of government property,

thefts from interstate shipments, etcetera. Such cameras, suitably

concealed and disguised can be activated by appropriate switches placed

in doorways, activated by removal of items stolen, et cetera.

In requesting Laboratory assistance in the applications

of motorized sequence cameras similar to those described herein, full

details resulting from a survey of the area where the photography is

to be conducted should be furnished the FBI Laboratory. Agents who

have completed the FBI Laboratory"s Specialized Photographic Training

available in most offices are familiar with these potential applications

and are best equipped to make surveys in the field preparatory to

furnishing required information to the Laboratory. On receipt of

justified field requests and adequate preliminary information, appropriate

equipment, including concealments when required, will be assembled

and prepared in the Laboratory suitable to each potential application.

This equipment, concealments, et cetera will be furnished with in-

structions and suggestions for installation and use. If required and

justified, Laboratory personnel will proceed to the site of applications

to assist in surveys and with installations.

totaled at the end of each month so that a continuing record is available.

On July 1, 1969, each office should submit a communication

to the Bureau, attention Voucher-Statistical Section, captioned "Matters

Referred for Prosecution by United States Attorneys," setting forth

the number of referrals for April, May and June, 1969. On October 1,

(D) WIRETAPPING AND EAVESDROPPING - INTERCEPTION OF

COMMONICATIONS - Under separate cover you will receive five (5)

copies of Memo No. 613, dated March 12, 1969, from the Department

to all U. S Attorneys re 'Interception of Communications. " The

instructions contained in that memorandum are for your immediate

guidance in ailwiretapping and eavesdropping matters based on Title

Ill of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, codified

as Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 2510 to 2520, inclusive.

The referenced memorandum comprises a part-by-part

explanation of Title III and the statement of certain policies which will

be followed in the enforcement of that statute. You and your supervisory

personnel must understand the law and follow the policies here established.

Your attention is drawn in particular to several points. First,

you must be conversant with the several types of conduct prohibited by

the statute. These prohibitions not only reveal the nature of the violations

concerning which you will receive complaints and make investigations;

they also mark the perimeter of permissible conduct for the investigative

personnel.of your office. Second, you must follow the policies set out

in the memorandum for various stages of each case, such as initiation of

the case, investigation, and forfeiture of contraband. Third, you should .

be constantly aware of the exceptions to the general prohibitions against

interception of communications. For example, nothing in the statute

prohibits a law enforcément officer from picking up an extension telephone

and listening to a telephone conversation, with the consent of one party/to

that conversation, and then testifying to what he heard. Another exception

allows law enforcement officers to intercept by court order.

Your constant awareness of the exceptions is necessary to the

effective discharge of the Bureau's responsibilities in other areas of our

jurisdiction. It is through these exceptions, properly used, that important

evicence may be obtained. You must be alert to possibilities for their

use and suggest these to the Bureau both in the individual case and in

• general. You must not make any use of forbidden interception devices,

however, without specific and prior Bureau approval in the individual case.

PHOTOGRAPHIC MATTERS -- COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY -- SAC

Letter 65-24(A), dated April 27, 1965, pointed out that the Bureau did

not contemplate authorizing any field office to set up color, photographic

laboratories. This policy is still in effect and requests for these facil-

ities will not be approved. Direct requests for color processing and

printing to Photographic Unit of Mechanical Section. If a situation exists

where it is impractical to submit film to Bureau, work may be done

locally through contract photographers or processing firms. M

Use color film where there are definite evidentiary or investigative

advantages. Avoid repeated exposures of same scene as this creates

needless work. Curtail use of Kodachrome film as Bureau cannot process

it and if received, it is sent out to be processed. When returned, a

negative must be prepared which causes delay, increases cost, and loses

some quality. It slides are needed, use Ektachrome film and forward to

Bureau for processing.

Do not use Polaroid film when negative-producing film should be

used. Restrict use of Polaroid film to situations which, due to time ele-

ment, do not permit normal procedures. To obtain additional prints of

Polaroid photographs, a negative must be made and detail is lost. When

color Polaroid film is used, a color shift is noted which prevents true

colors from being reproduced.

Be sure cut sheet film is properly seated in holders and inserted

so emulsion side is facing correct way. Bureau has often found film is

reversed, not seated properly, and misidentified as to color when it is

black and white or vice versa.

Discuss above natters with pertinent personnel.

RUSSIA - To effect more efficient utilization of manpower assigned to

these investigations, certain existing programs are being curtailed. Pro-

grams are identified below with current and revised criteria set forth.

New criteria are effective immediately. Pending investigations in these

areas should be immediately reviewed, cases not meeting revised criteria

closed and Bureau advised under individual caption. Changes apply only

to Soviet investigations. Revisions of indicated sections of Manual of

Instructions (MOI) will be issued.

•(1) Visitors to Russia (Section 105G, MOI) '

Current provisions require cases to be opened on a selective basis

in instances where U. S. citizens or resident aliens in I. S. travel to

Soviet Union.

Henceforth, investigation should be initiated only in those cases in

which an allegation is present indicating some degree of interest in sub-

ject by Soyiet Intelligence Services (SIS) or other unusual circumstances

exist which imply a direct FBI interest. Examples of such circumstances

are: hostage situation exists; subject is former Soviet national; subject

is known to be pro-Soviet or has close personal ties to Soviet Union; or

previous information indicates significant contacts between subject and

Soviet officials and/or' nationals. Advise Bureau when investigation is

opened.

(2)

Nonofficial Soviet Visitors to U. S. (Section 105E, MOI)

Current provisions require cases be opened on a nonofficial

Soviet visitor (B-2 type vida) only if between the ages of 17 and 60 and

resident of USSR within two years preceding entry into U. S.

Henceforth, no cases of this type will be opened except where

review of Bureau or field office files indicates that visitor is affiliated

with Soviet intelligence or that the individual to whom Soviet is destined

is so sensitively employed as to be a logical target of Soviet intelligence.

(3) Soviet Participants in East-West Exchange Program (Section

105K, MOI)

Current provisions require cases be opened on all Soviet tourist

and exchange groups and all individual Soviet participants in the exchange

program and investigation conducted depending on intelligence significance

and length of stay in U. S.

Henceforth, no investigations will be conducted of either groups

or individuals regardless of their length of stay in any one area in the

absence of any information indicating affiliation with Soviet intelligence.

Bureau files will continue to be checked concerning Soviet par-

ticipants and where information is developed concerning intelligence

affiliation;, appropriate instructions will be issued to the field.

In the absence of significant intelligence data, copies of Depart-

ment of State telegrams will be furnished to interested field offices

for informative purposes only and no inquiry should be initiated upon re-

ceipt thereof. The names of the Soviet participants should be indexed

by the offices to which destined and the forms filed in a suitable control

file.

(E) INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OT CRIMES AGÁINST THE

PERSON -- On several recent occasions the Bureau has noted individual

field offices taking steps to initiate prosecutive action in crimes

against the person such as extortion, kidnaping, crime on a Government

reservation, assault, rape, et cetera, based solely on a statement

furnished by the victim. While it is imperative that a prosecutive

decision be sought as early as possible during the investigation, care

should be exercised so that such discussions with the U. S. Attorney

(USA) do not result in prematurely obtaining process.

Accordingly, if a victim reports a crime against his person

within FBI jurisdiction, immediate investigation should be initiated to

corroborate. through evidence the allegations made by the victim. In

many instances, investigation may show a relationship between the sub-

ject and victim. This may have a definite bearing upon the prosecutive

decision of the USA. Thorough investigation of all such complaints

at the outset will oftentimes save unnecessary investigative time and

effort.

These instructions are not to be interpreted as suggesting you

delay in conferring with USA when such action is obviously required.

(C) FALSE STATEMENTS TO BUREAU AGENTS! FRAUD AGAINST

THE GOVERNMENT -- There has been a noticeable increase in the

number of instances in which U. S. Attorneys have authorized prosecution

under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1001, without first obtaining authori-

zation from: the appropriate Assistant Attorney General, Department of

Justice, when false statements and complaints have been made to Bureau

Agents.

In many of these instances the Department has instructed the

U. S. Attorneys to dismiss process since the facts do not warrant

prosecution.

For your guidance, the Department's memorandum #3 18 to

all U. S. Attorneys dated July 23, 1962, and as modified by its

memorandum #331 dated November 5, 1962, stated that Title 10, U. s.

Code, Section 1001, should be applied cautiously due to the tendency such

prosecutions may have to discourage the making of legitimate complaints.

These memoranda provide that no prosecution under this Statute involving

false statements, oral or written, volunteered or otherwise, made to any

Agent or investigator of any Department or agency of the Government,

may be initiated without permission of the appropriate Assistant Attorney

General.

In July, 1967, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in

U. S. V. Adler, 380 E2d 917 (1967), upheld the conviction of Adler for

making a false complaint of bribery on Government construction contracts

to the New York FBI Office. On December 11, 1967, the U. S. Supreme

Court denied certiorari in the Adler case which leaves the conviction

standing. Even though the Adler decision is favorable to the Bureau,

there has been no change in the Department's views as expressed in its

memoranda #'s 318 and 331.

It has been the policy of the Department to limit prosecution

to those deserving cases involving unsolicited false statements to investi-

gative personnel which result in the expenditure of undue Agent investigative

time and effort.

All investigative personnel must be alert to the Department's

policy in false statement cases during discussions with U. S. Attorneys.

In instances where prosecution is being considered, the Agents must

make certain that the J. S. Attorney has secured Department authority

prior to initiating prosecutive action. Specific comments on this point

are to be included in communications advising the Bureau of the prosecutive

action.

(D) TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTION -

The following significant decisions were reported in

January, 1971, and should be read by all Legal Instructors: U. S.

v. Nasse, 432 F2d 1293 (1970) (7th Cir.), decision quotes approved

FBI affidavit for motor yehicle search warrant based on report irom

confidential informant, U.' S. v. Harrison, 432 F2d 1328 (1970) (D. C.

Cir.), action of officers in grabbing defendant by throat to prevent

him from swallowing evidence was reasonable action to prevent

-destruction of evidence while executing arrest and search warrants;

U. S. V. Robinson, 432 E2d 1348 (1970) (D. C. Cir.), post-arrest

suspect identification by display of subject's photograph among others

approved; U. S. v. Kwitek, 433 F2d 18 (1970) (7th Cir.), where

defendant was arrested on third floor of hotel and was searched and

key to hotel room 30 yards away was taken from his pocket, search

of that room incidental to arrest was unreasonable, U. S. v. Cataldo,

433 F2d 38 (1970) (2nd Cir.), joint tenant of apartment had authority

to consent to entry by FBI Agents into cotenant's separate bedroom;

Ü. S. v. Polk, 433 F2d 644 (1970) (5th Cir.), police observation of

vehicle identification number on suspect car being legally held was not

an unreasonable search; U. S. v. Viggiano, 433 'F2d 716 (1970 (2nd

Cir.), example of approved FBI search warrant affidavit based on

investigation and report from informant; U. S. v. Magnotti, 318 F.

Supp. 535 (1970) (D. Conn.), suspect has no right to have counsel

present during viewing of photographs by bank robbery witnesses.

Suspect not prejudiced by fact that his photo was full-length and those

of seven other persons were mug shots, Haskins v. U. S., 433 F2d

836 (1970) (10th Cir.), an accused has no constitutional right to be

identified from a lineup; U. S. v. DeBose, 433 F2d 916 (1970) (6th

Cir.), where a suspect was 6 feet 5 inches tall and only one other

man in lineup was as tall as 6 feet, the lineup was impermissibly

suggestive; Terry v. Peyton, 433 F2d 1016 (1970) (4th Cir.), "One

on one" lineup is improper but does not invalidate in-court identifi-

cation where victim- witness had good look at subject when robbery

occurred. Accord: U.S. V. Kemper, 433 ERa 1153 (1970) 1D. C.

Cir.), U.

S. V. Hopkins, 433 F2d 1041 (1970) (5th Cir.), warrant-

less inspection of lawfully impounded car to locate vehicle identifi-

cation number is not an unreasonable search. Properly warned

accused who first refused to waive Miranda rights and then initiated

exculpatory conversation has by latter act waived those rights; U. S.

(E) CRIME ABOARD AIRCRAFT MATTERS - - Reference is made to SAC

Letter 70-53 dated September 25, 1970.

Violations of the Crime Aboard Aircraft Statute have been in-

creasing throughout the country. Referenced SAC Letter instructed each

office to formulate plans to effectively discharge its responsibilities

regarding violations of this statute. Proper liaisen must be established

with the U. S. Marshal; local authorities, and airline officials so that

they are fully aware of our investigative responsibilities. Effective

liaison will insure we are promptly notified of violations.

Each office should insure sufficient personnel are available

on a 24-hour basis to respond to all complaints. An immediate response

to complaints is necessary in order that appropriate investigation can be

conducted, the U: S.. Attorney contacted, and a prosecutive opinion

obtained. If prosecution is authorized, you should immediately follow

through with the necessary prosecutive steps.

Each SAC will be held personally responsible to insure these

cases are properly handled.

(F) PHOTOGRAPHING OF VISITORS TO PUBLIC AGENCIES -- Adverse

publicity has followed a recent incident in which persons visiting a Federal

agency for the purpose of lodging a complaint were photograped by the

local police department. In order to preclude the Bureau becoming

involved in a similar incident in the future, no attempts are to be made

to photograph such visitors without the specific authority.of the Bureau. :

In each such incident of this nature the authority of the Attorney.

General must be ebtained. Ample time must be allowed, therefore, in

order to obtain such authority.

These instructions do not change previous requirements as

set out in SAC Letter 65-49, dated September 1, 1965.

2/16/71.

SAC LETTER 71-7

(G) TEN MOST WANTED FUGITIVES PROGRAM -- To insure continued

success of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives Program, this is to remind

all offices of their individual responsibility to undertake independent,

self-initiated investigation relative to each of these important cases.

While offices of origin are responsible at the field level for giving

direction to these cases, experience has demonstrated that most of these

subjects are located outside the territory of the office of origin. As you

know, present requirements (FBI Handbook, Part I, page 25) are that

all ,continental offices must keep these cases pending and are to. fully

exploit investigative techniques which are readily available, including

various record checks.

The fact that a number of the subjects on the Ten Most Wanted

Fugitives list presently being sought are associated with cases generally

described as being in the "New Left" category underscores the need for

closely coordinating these cases within each field division. Such cases

provide an excellent opportunity for developing sources and informants,

both in the criminal and security fields, and for close teamwork on the

part of Agents working in both of these fields.

Publicity given by news

media to the mode of life adopted by persons in this category, including

the: ease with which criminals of all types being sought can find assistance

through these individuals and groups, makes it particularly important that

2/16/71

SAC LETTER 71-7

-5-

NW 55041 DooId: 32989525 Page 104

---

## Page 105

this type of close coordination, including free exchange of photographs

and descriptive data, be maintained among all Agents.

Continued efforts must be made to determine whether or not

any of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives may be hidden out in so-called

"communes" in either urban or rural areas of your territory. This must

include continued full utilization of such investigative aids as publicity

concerning these individuals, circularization through use of a letter con-

taining photographs and descriptive data of the fugitives aimed at specific

facets of the subjects' backgrounds, special circularization of

Identification Orders and Wanted Flyers, and judicious use of financial

inducement. With regard to the latter, Bureau clearance must be obtained,

of course, in connection with any specific offer.

• Each office must, on a continuing basis, review cases on the

Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list and, based on the facts within the particular

field division, apply those techniques which offer the greatest potential

for successful results.

In order for the Bureau to be informed of the extent of investi-

gative activity which is being initiated throughout the field in these cases,

you are instructed to submit to the Bureau within two weeks of the date

of this letter a comprehensive communication setting out by case caption

a succinct summary of exactly what is being done to locate individuals

on the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list within your field division territory.

At the same time, we have been authorized to increase our personnel

complement; and it is, therefore, mandatory every ettori be exerted

in order for the Bureau to favorably portray its'investigative

Reports setting forth the results of prosecution,

including sentences received, are to be immediately submitted to the

No delays or shortcomings will be tolerated.

• (I) THUMBNAIL SKETCHES - Under existing reporting procedures,

thumbnail skeiches prepared as appendix pages are affixed to reports

and letterhead memoranda (LHMs) to characterize each subversive

organization mentioned in the pertinent communication. In many®

instances, this has considerably increased the size of the report or

LHM. In order to save space, effect a monetary saving, and add to

the readability of these documents, this procedure is being modifiea.

Appendix page thumbnail sketches will continue to be required in

Security of Government Employees and Applicant investigations,

with such pages being added to the end of the communication.

However, reporis and uhMs in all other security classifications will

contain an abbreviated characterization in the details immediately

following the first mention of an organization, and appending a

thumbnail sketch will be eliminated. Field offices will continue to

furnisli current thumbnail sketches to the Bureau on an annual basis

on organizations where they are office of origin. An abbreviated

characterization of two or three lines will be included with these

annual submissions, and the abbreviated version will be used in all

security; classifications, except as noted.

for your guidance, the following abbreviated thumbnail

sketch of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) has been approved by

the Bureau:

The PLP was founded in 1962 by

individuals expelled from the Communist

, Party, USA, for following the Chinese

communist line. Its objective is the

establishment of a militant working-class

movement based on Marxism-Leninism and

MAO Tse-tung thought.

As is currently required, thumbnail sketches will first

be approved at the Seat of Government and thereafter used throughout

the field. Similarly,. Bureau approval of the abbreviated character-

izations will also be required before field use.

In order to implement this new procedure as soon as

practical, all field offices are instructed to submit by April 1, 1971,

abbreviated characterizations on organizations where they are origin

and on which they have already submitted full-length thumbnail

sketches. Each brief descriptive characterization should be on a

separate page with a single cover communication referencing this

SAC Letter. This procedure will also be followed when thumbnail

sketches are submitted on organizations not presently characterized

or whenever changes in existing thumbnail sketches become necessary.

(A) TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTION -

The following instructive Federal decisions reported in

November, 1971, should be read by alf Legal Instructors: City officers

searching residence by warrant for stolen clothing invited Narcotics officer

along to 'keep eyes open for narcotics." Search extended beyond finding

of clothing, and located contraband firearm. Firearm/excluded from

evidence; search as to that item was not in good faith! U.S. V. Tranquillo,

330 F. Supp. 871 (1971)(M.D. Fla.). Volunteered admissions concerning

one criminal charge, made by person in jail on unrelated charge, admissible

without proof of Miranda warnings. Cook v. Cox, 330 F. Supp. 1323 (1971)

(W.D. Va.). Good review of various types of searches which are exceptions

to basic rule that all searches must be by warrant. Wheeler y. foodman

330 E. Supp. 1356 (1971) (W.D. N.C.). Ettective waiver oi Miranda rights

may be given orally after refusal to sign formal waiver form. On-the-scene

identification of bank robber returned to bank by arresting officer within 30

minutes of commission of offense was lawfull' U.S. Yu Savage, 331 F. Supp.

177 (1971)(E. D. Pa.). Where Narcotics officers, acting on court wiretapping

order, monitored all calls 24 hours a day, and approximately 60% of calls

had nothing to do with crime, failure of the officers to follow the court's order

to "minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to

interception" required suppression of all conversations overheard.

MUS m Scott, 331 F. Supp. 233 (1971)(D.C.). Example of "close pursuit"

justifying pificer's arrest beyond his geographical jurisdiction. Reves v

Slayton, 331 F. Supp. 325 (1971)(W.D. Va.). A confession motivated by

prior unlawful search and seizure of defendant, his articles or his premises,

is inadmissible in evidence.JU.S. v. Ortiz, 331 F. Supp. 514 (1971)

(D. Puerto Rico). FBI Agents with Warrants to search person and

premises of defendant as interstate gambling operator broke into his

barricaded premises and found him eating the paper evidence. Defendant

refused to cease mastication and was forcibly restrained. Charged with

factors affecting reliability of confidential informant in stating probable

cause. Corroborated informant is reliable without proof of past reliability.

Announcement of "police" and "you are under arrest" was sufficient

compliance under circumstances with statutory requirement of notice

before entry. U.S. v. Squella-Avedano, 447 F2d 575 (1971)(5th Cir.).

No arrest where suspect voluntarily complies with request of ofticers

that his earlier post-arrest admissions were involuntary.WU.S. v. Howell,

34T F2d 1114 (1971)(2d Cir.). Defendant's fingerprints may be taken at

trial for purpose of proving prior offenses at sentencing hearing."" Redd te

Decker, 447 FZa 1346 (1971)(5th Cir.). Instructive opinion on vehicle

search by trattic ofticer. No license plate light, no registration, and an

open can of beer on front seat led to lawful search of entire vehicle and

discovery of stolen goods. Kendrick v. Nelson, 448 F2d 25 (1971)(9th Cir.).

Circumstances justifying investigative stop of suspect felon. Probable

cause for later search of vehicle by one officer may be found in collective

knowledge of all officers working on case. Test of probable cause is

found in objective view of facts rather than in officer's ability to articulate

his theory a White v. U.S., 448 F2d 250 (1971)(8th Cir.). Refusal of

entrance to known law enforcement ofticer is factor in showing probable

cause for arrest. Entry without announcement justified where facts

known to officer indicate subject attempting to escape and that contraband

was threatened with destruction.y U.S. V. Cisneros, 448 E2d 298 (1971)

(9th Cir.). Once an accused in custody has been warned under Miranda

and has refused to sign written waiver, interrogation must cease unless

accused himself initiates further discussion. Otherwise, subsequent

statement is inadmissible. Note: This decision more restrictive than

in other circuits:: U.S. v. Ramos, 448 F2d 398 (1971)(5th Cir.). For

evidence and contraband seen close to an end table, in room of arrest,

(D) PASSPORT OFFICE WATCH LIST -- The Passport Office of the

Department of State has computerized the names and dates of birth

of persons of interest to the Government for various reasons in order

that the interested agency may be informed should such persons apply

stor a United states passport.

In connection with security cases, these

lookout notices will automatically expire five years from the date they

were requested. Should such a lookout be desired in any security case,

a lead should be set out for the Washington Field Office to place a stop

with the Passport Office. This stop should be canceled as soon as the

subject is no longer of security interest and appropriate ticklers should

be set so that the Washington Field Office may be requested to ask that

the notice be extended beyond the five-year expiration date, if this is

considered necessary.

Information which may be expected as the result of a

Passport Office stop notice includes a general proposed itinerary,

normally consisting solely of the names of the countries to be visited,

and the proposed dates of travel. Once a passport is issued, the proposed

travel need not be undertaken, and the itinerary may be altered at will.

Additional foreign travel, of course, can be taken with the passport

without any notification to the Department of State.

LIAISON -- It

has come to the Bureau's attention ta & west Coast manufacturing

company has been soliciting FBI attendance at demonstrations of their

product in various field office territories. In at least one case where

the company's invitation was accepted, an attempt was made to explore

the FBI's "reaction" to the demonstration to the extent that an inquiry

was made of a United States Congressman. The Congressman was

advised, and you are being reminded that, as a matter of policy, the

FBI does not evaluate or recommend commercial products except

for its own internal use.

C

It later developed that an executive of the company has

engaged in promoting investment in the concern among police officers

claiming that the IBI has expressed interest in his equipment.

It is recognized that occasionally a tiela office receives

unsolicited information pertaining to technical eatipment which may

have application in our work. The FBI Laboratory wants to be aware

of technical developments and appreciates receiving material of this

sort from the field for evaluation. Notwithstanding this, Agents

should be most circumspect in expressing what they consider to be

the Bureau's needs for specific equipment last their remarks be

interpreted as FBI approval of a particular product.

REPULSE - ESPIONAGE - R -- The Soviet Disinformation Department of

the KGB, the Soviet Committee for State Security, is currently engaged in an

intensive smear campaign directed against me which amounts to character

assassination. The campaign involves widespread mailings of what purports to

be a letter over my signature to former White House aide Walter Jenkins,

The first mailings of these letters occurred in January, 1965. Others

were mailed in April, 1965. The most recent mailings were postmarked

January 2, 1966, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore, Maryland. The

envelopes used in the mailings are either white or gray and bear a typewritten

address, but no return address. They are stamped with an ordinary five cent

stamp, a Christmas stamp, or a Robert Fulton commemorative stamp.

The scurrilous contents of the enrelopes consist of a reproduction of a

page from the "U. S. News & World Report"' magazine issue dated November 2;

1964, captioned "What the FBI Found in the Jenkins Case." On the reverse side

of the page is a montage of what purports to be fragments of a letter bearing my

signature, a letter to the President at the White House, and a typewritten comment

commencing "Dear Friend. "

Should such a letter come to your attention, the original envelope and

its contents should be transmitted immediately to the Bureau marked for the

attention of the FBI Laboratory, with the request that the typewriting be compared

with other specimens in this matter and that latent fingerprints be developed.

In the recent flood of mailings, letters were directed to various

Senators, Congressmen and other prominent Government officials in Washington,

D. C. Among the recipients was Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper, who requested

that I furnish him with the complete facts, as known to this Bureau, concerning

the anonymous communication received by him. Attached for your information

is a copy of my reply to him. Senator Hickenlooper has advised me of his

intention to have my reply printed in the "Congressional Record." As soon as

this is done, reprints of it will be mailed by the Bureau to all the known

recipients of the letters to date. In addition, reprints will be turnished to all

field offices to be used in answering any inquiries which may be received

concerning this widespread Soviet smear compaign, whether they originate

from individuals who also may receive copies of the scurrilous letter or irom

other individuals such as members of the press who may hear about them and

make inquiry of you concerning them. Until you receive such reprints, your

replies to any inquiries received may be based on the information contained in my

attached reply to Senator Hickenlooper.

Honorable Bourke B. Hickenlooper

United States Senate

Washington, D. C.

My dear Senator:

This is to acknowledge your request for the

complete facts as known to this Bureau concerning the

anonymous letter you received containing what purports

to be a copy of a personal letter to former White House

aide Walter Jenkins over my signature.

I am pleased to comply with your request and

will begin first by stating without any equivocation

that I never wrote

such

• a letter.

The letter you received is one of many

anonymous mailings sent to various senators, Congressmen,

and other prominent Government officials within the past

week.

They are part of a concerted communist smear

campaign which was launched a year ago.

The campaign began in January, 1965, when

several letters of this type were received by individuals

who also brought them to my attention. Several more were

brought to my attention by individuals who received them

in April, 1965.

Upon examination, the copy of the letter

supposedly signed by me was determined to be a crude

forgery.

Comparison of all the letters disclosed they

had all been prepared by the same person or persons.

Further comparison with other letters circulated in

the past in this and other countries by the Soviet

Disinformation Department proved irreiutably that this

was a communist

scheme.

Honorable Bourke B. Hickenlooper

You may recall that the nefarious schemes

of the Soviet Disinformation Department were exposed in

a report prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency

last year.

The details of that Agency's study were

printed in the "Congressional Record" of September 28, 1965.

The study revealed that the Soviet Disinformation

Department of the KGB, the Soviet Committee for State

NeCurIty, wages a broad-scaled propaganda offensive

against United States agencies

and pointed out that I

and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are priority

targets for attacks. It also disclosed that the over-all

objective is to discredit United States agencies here

and abroad and emphasized that a preferred instrument used

by the Soviets in their attacks is the forged document.

Typical of the tactics used in such efforts was

the circulation of letters in South America in the Summer

of 1964.

In that case too, my name had been forged on

the letters. They were designed to make it appear that

the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central

Intelligence Agency had something to do with the Brazilian

revolution of April, 1964.

The intricacies of that

communist scheme became further apparent when we determined

that my signature had been forged from a letter stolen by

Cubans in Havana in 1960.

I trust that in making these facts available

to you I have satisfied any and all questions which

the

scurrilous anonymous communication you received may have

raised. If not, do not hesitate to call on me again.

In conclusion, I would like to express my

appreciation to you for bringing the letter to my attention.

It provides another link in the chain of evidence being put

together to complete the picture of this Soviet smear

campaign, which amounts to character assassination.

Sincerely yours,

/S/ J. Edgar Hoover

(A) UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS -- A Senate Subcommittee recently

opened an inquiry into the United States Commissioner system, possibly in

response to criticism of various features of the system such as payment on

a fee basis and the appointment of Commissioners untrained in the law.

You are instructed to advise the Bureau of the merits and the

demerits of the system which have been noticed in your field office territory.

The range of possible defects is wide, including, but not limited to, your

inability to locate a Commissioner when needed; unfamiliarity of the

Commissioner with the law on probable cause for arrest warrants, arrest

without a warrant and search warrants; abuse of authority by attempting to

convert a hearing into a trial on the merits; prejudice; refusal of a

Commissioner to issue a warrant to an Agent whose only information is

that obtained from other Agents; refusal to accept hearsay evidence to

establish probable cause at the preliminary hearing; too few Commissioners

or too many in your territory, et cetera.

Show the number and location of Commissioners in your territory

at this time and the maximum distance that any Resident Agent in the territory

must travel to reach a Commissioner.

Advise the Bureau only of those apparent defects which have come

to your attention in the normal course of business. Do not make an official

inquiry or survey of any kind, or make any comment to persons outside

the Bureau

To the extent that the experience of your office with the system

is favorable, you should so advise. The Bureau desires a fair appraisal

of the system on the basis of facts known to you at this time.

accordance with arrangements made with the American Telephone and Telegraph

Company, long distance toll tickets will be retained for only a six-month period

by Bell System companies. In the event there is substantial reason to believe

that the retention of such records for a longer period of time is of import to

together with information indicating whether your telephone company contacts

are such as to conveniently secure the needed records.

(C) SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS - DELINQUENCY -- The continuing

trend toward a higher delinquency in the handling of Selective Service investigations

is noted on the part of a number of field offices.

The ever-increasing number of Selective Service cases being referred

to the Bureau for investigation is consistent with the increasing number of men

being called into military service. With the heavy Armed Forces commitments

this country has in various parts of the world, there must be no lengthy delays

in these investigations.

Each Special Agent in Charge should immediately look into the status

of pending Selective Service matters. You should make certain that these

investigations are being instituted promptly and that once the investigation

commences, there are no unwarranted delays.

(D) COMMUNIST SUBVERSION IN LATIN AMERICA -- Your attention is directed

to SAC Letter €5-31 (A) dated June 2, 1965, which pointed out the over-all need

for additional informants and sources in the Latin-American field because of

the critical state of unrest in Latin America.

Recent intelligence reports on happenings at the Tri-Continental

Conference held in Havana, Cuba, from January 3-14, 1966, underscore the

importance which must be attached to Latin-American investigations and

related matters.

At this Tri-Continental Conference attended by approximately 450

key revolutionary leaders primarily from countries of Africa, Asia and Latin

America, Premier Fidèl Castro and President Osvaldo Dorticos of Cuba made

a most vitriolic attack against the United States and issued a strong call for an

'implacable struggle against "imperialism." The destruction of the United

States position in Latin America was enunciated as a primary foreign policy

objective of Cuba.

In this regard, possibly the most significant development was the

formation of a Latin-American Solidarity Organization, with headquarters in

Havana. This organization was formed by representatives from 27 of the

Latin-American Delegations who attended the Tri-Continental Conference

and it was announced that this organization would use all means available to

support liberation movements and would develop "a constant campaign against

the increasing policy of Yankee imperialism...."

In view of this overt indication on the part of Cuba of increased

support to communist subversion throughout Latin America, you must make

most certain that the informant coverage within your Division among all Latin-

American nationality groups where such exist is not lacking in any respect.

The importance which the Bureau attaches to Latin-American

investigations and related matters in this field such as source development

and foreign intelligence collection cannot be stressed too strongly.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(A) CORRESPONDENCE MATTER - FURNISHING OF HOME ADDRESSES

AND ZIP CODES -- Effective immediately it is desired that you furnish

the home addresses and Zip codes when recommending personal letters

for individuals who have retired and have left their previous places of

employment. This would include SAC contacts, prominent businessmen,

National Academy graduates and the like. Many instances have been noted

recently where such data was not furnished, and it is most difficult to

locate the correct address through Bureau source material because of the

similarity in names.

(B) OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE - NAVAL INVESTIGATIVE

SERVICE -- The Naval Investigative Service recently became the new

name of those elements of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) charged

with the world-wide investigative and counterintelligence responsibilities

of the Department of the Navy. This resulted from a reorganization, ordered

by the Secretary of the Navy, for the primary purpose of placing the Director

of Naval Intelligence in full control of personnel in the field and removing

them from control of the Commandants of Naval Districts in the United

States and Naval commanders in overseas areas. In addition, field

personnel will now report directly to the Director of ONI, through the

Naval Investigative Service Headquarters at Washington.

All District Intelligence Offices in the United States have been

abolished and reconstituted as Naval Investigative Service Offices, each

headed by the former District Intelligence Officer, now called Commanding

Officer.

Overseas elements, which formerly operated under the name

Naval Counterintelligence Support Activity, have been similarly reconstituted.

The fact that the new component is a subsidiary of ONI will be made plain by

the use of the ONI seal on its stationery and the appearance of the name

"Office of Naval Intelligence" on the doors of its offices.

It is not anticipated that this internal change will have any effect

on our relations with ONI, either at the Seat of Government or in the field;

however, you are being advised of it as a matter of information.

(C) TRAINING - POLICE - COMMAND AND SUPERVISORY SCHOOLS -- Bureau

has previously instructed you to insure that local law enforcement is aware of

the availability of our assistance in schools for command and supervisory

personnel. With the increasing efforts to raise the standards and the status of

law enforcement, training for police administrators at all levels is of

paramount importance. It is axiomatic that police executives need to be

apprised of developments and innovations in law enforcement, just as recruits

need basic training, to function effectively.

Representatives throughout our field divisions attended the

Specialized Police Instructors School on Police Management held at the Seat

of Government on 2/28 - 3/11/66. Bureau instructors are now particularly

well qualified to provide instruction on topical matters of interest to law

enforcement administrators. No prescribed format for these schools is

being suggested, as each school should be tailored to meet the needs of

those in attendance. General police instructors, in addition to those who

attended the above-mentioned Police Instructors School, should review and

assimilate the considerable amount of resource material distributed at the

School in order that each office will have an adequate corps of qualified

instructors to handle this phase of training.

You should insure that law enforcement executives throughout your

division know we are equipped to provide training on the Police Management

level. Without soliciting such training you should, nevertheless, set up a

vigorous program of promoting knowledge of our training services in that

field. Bureau should not be placed in the untenable position of defending

ourselves against critics who might maintain we do not have an adequate

program of training for police executives; such a situation may possibly

develop if you adopt a listless attitude toward such training.

(D) TELEPHONES - ECONOMY - SEMIANNUAL DESK-TO-DESK

TELEPHONE SURVEY -- Each field division will survey its field head-

quarters and resident agency telephone equipment and facilities during April,

Remove all equipment and facilities not needed for conducting

day-to-day business. Do not retain any facility or equipment simply for

convenience, prestige, or because its use has become a habit rather than

a necessity. The reduction in lines (extensions off the switchboard) and

multibutton telephone instruments with "hold"' and lights should be your

first concern. Any line used for less than 20 combined in-and-out calls

a day should be removed from service, and justification for its retention

can be based only on some unusual circumstance, especially if a number

of the daily calls handled on it are outgoing calls which could have been

made on another line on the same telephone instrument.

There is no charge for a telephone company's work in reducing

facilities. Remove wink hold (the light on the button for a line winks when

the line is placed on hold) on each line on which it appears. Where it is

not removed justify its retention in your survey report, explaining fully

the number of lines on the instrument and why the wink feature is necessary.

Submit as an attachment to form FD-344 for each of your resident

agencies the number of Special Agents assigned, an itemization of telephone

equipment, including telephone trunk numbers, and monthly cost of each

item of equipment.

It is suggested you assign your senior Electronic

Maintenance Technician to handle technical aspects of the survey unless

another employee is better qualified.

SAC LETTER 66-19

(E) ARRESTS - SEARCHES AND SEIZURES - COMPLAINTS FILED

BEFORE U. S. COMMISSIONERS -- A recent field inspection disclosed

that complaints filed before the U. S. Commissioner by Bureau Agents

upon which arrest warrants were issued contained no information about

the crimes alleged except for conclusory allegations that the persons

named in the warrants had committed certain offenses.

The complaint

in these instances stated no facts (probable cause) to back up the

complainant's conclusion that the subject had committed the crime.

All warrants - both arrest warrants and search warrants -

issued on nothing more than conclusory allegations of crime are deficient

and vulnerable to being declared null and void. The Fourth Amendment:

requires that each arrest be made on probable cause for belief of guilt,

3/29/66

SAC LETTER 66-19

-3 -

MW 55041 DooId: 32989525 Page 129

---

## Page 130

and that each search by search warrant also be made on probable cause.

If the arresting or searching officers first apply for a warrant, they must

reveal to the U. S. Commissioner or other issuing officer a set of facts

of sufficient quantity and quality to show probable cause. Giordenello v.

U.S., 357 U. S. 480 (1958); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 (1964). If

the arrest is made without a warrant, the facts of probable cause must be

given when the subsequent complaint is filed. If no complaint is filed after

arrest, as in some state cases, the facts of probable cause must be given

to the judge when he holds a hearing on the issue of probable cause after

it has been raised by the defense. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U. S. 89 (1964).

The reason for the procedure stated above is that it is the

magistrate or judge who must finally determine the issue of probable

cause, and he can perform this duty only on the basis of facts indicating

The officer's personal conclusion of guilt is not enough.

The proper method of showing probable cause was brought to

your attention in SAC Letters 58-44 (B) and (C), 58-49 (F), 58-60 (G),

and 58-80 (D). Samples of complaints based on facts stated were shown.

See also the Bureau manuals.

You are instructed to immediately review this subject and to

make sure that the personnel of your office are following Bureau instructions

in general regarding the filing of complaints and those issued by the U. S.

Attorney in each particular case.

It is the responsibility of the Special Agent signing the complaint

to be sure that it contains an adequate statement of probable cause and he

should be certain that if facts constituting probable cause were furnished

the U. S. Commissioner orally they have been sufficiently set forth in the

typing of the complaint. The advice of the U. S. Attorney may be obtained

as to the particular facts necessary to show probable cause in the

complaint.

(F) "KIDS' LETTERS TO THE'F. B.I." - BY BILL ADLER - ILLUSTRATED

BY ARNOLD ROTH -- The Bureau assisted in the preparation of this book

which is being released on April 1, 1966, by Prentice-Hall, Incorporated.

This book, which is 156 pages long, is composed of approximately 110

letters received by the Bureau from boys and girls of various ages. By

their nature, the letters are most humorous and portray the FBI in a warm

and human manner.

The retail price of the book is $2. 50 but through a bulk purchase

arrangement with the publisher, FBI employees may buy it for $1.25

through the FBI Recreation Association. Inasmuch as it is believed this

publication will be very popular with FBI employees, an initial order has

been placed with Prentice-Hall for 5, 000 copies. The Crime Records

Division will handle the distribution of this book.

You should canvass the employees in your office to determine

the number who are interested in purchasing this book at the reduced

price.

Each office should submit its initial order, along with one check

covering the total order in your office figured at $1. 25 per copy, by

routing slip to the Crime Records Division by April 15, 1966. This

check should be made payable to the "FBIRA." Regular orders can be

submitted at any time after this date.

(G) ASSAULTING, KILLING OR KIDNAPING THE PRESIDENT OF THE

UNITED STATES -- The attention of all personnel is directed to current

instructions concerning the handling of violations of this statute which

have recently been placed in both the FBI Agents' Handbook and the Manual

of Instructions. It is imperative that all investigative personnel and all

clerical personnel in a position to receive complaints be fully aware of

FBI investigative responsibilities under the new law, Section 1751, Title

18, U. S. Code, approved August 28, 1965. All personnel should be

particularly alert to differentiate between violations of this statute which

are under FBI jurisdiction and violations of Section 871, Title 18, U. S.

Code, Threats Against the President, under United States Secret Service

jurisdiction. Any question of jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of

immediate investigation by the FBI in accordance with existing instructions.

Each SAC will be held personally responsible to insure that

complaints involving violations of Section 1751, Title 18, are afforded

immediate, aggressive investigative attention, utilizing whatever manpower

is necessary to resolve the situation and the Bureau is notified immediately

by telephone. Subsequent to Bureau notification, the Secret Service should

be advised locally and, where appropriate, notified that the FBIis conducting

investigation in order to determine whether a violation of Section 1751,

Title 18, U. S. Code, exists.

(H) MAINTENANCE AND DESTRUCTION OF OBSCENE EVIDENCE -

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF OBSCENE MATTER -- Because of

the large volume of obscene evidence being regularly received in the FBI

Laboratory and the urgent need for careful handling, the basic rules for

maintenance and destruction as set forth in Section 57C, page 3, of the

Manual of Instructions are restated.

"Obscene material is submitted to the Laboratory in order that

it may be:

a. Reviewed at the Bureau with regard to its character as an obscene exhibit

b. Compared with specimens already in the obscene matter file of the FBI

Laboratory, and any latent fingerprints developed thereon searched

3/29/66

SAC LETTER 66-19

NW 55041

DocId: 32989525

through the obscene matter dealers section of the single fingerprint

file, to determine its source

Compared with specimens already in the obscene matter file of the

FBI Laboratory for information that may indicate that the questioned

obscene material has moved in interstate commerce

d. Included as a permanent part of the obscene matter file or destroyed

where no purpose could be served by filing the exhibit."

The manual instructs that in all cases exhibits returned to the

submitting division must ultimately be returned to the FBI Laboratory for

filing or destruction and that no obscene material is to be permanently

maintained in any field office. There are instances, however, involving

huge quantities of pornography seized in certain cases where there is

considerable expense in shipping the evidence back to the Laboratory for

final disposition. In these instances the Bureau's advice should be sought

as to whether it should be returned to the FBI Laboratory or whether Bureau

permission may be granted to destroy the material in the field division under

the personal supervision of the SAC. If little or none of the bulky evidence

is needed for the Obscene File and common sense suggests, the Bureau may

authorize destruction of the useless portion of the material in the division

office under rigid controls, personally supervised by the SAC.

While obscene material which may arouse the curiosity of

employees is in the office, it must be maintained in either the gun vault or

the SAC's safe. At no time should it be kept in a place which is readily

accessible to other employees, such as the stock room or mail room.

While this material is in the office, it must not be shown to

other personnel of the office who have no need to observe it. Of course,

personnel handling the case may have need to observe it for investigative

purposes or for packaging and wrapping purposes. However, there should

be no undue curiosity about such filth.

information of a nature revealing the presence of any effort designed to cause

physical harm or embarrassment to the Secretary of State or to members of

the U. S. Delegation accompanying him during his travel. Accordingly, all

offices should immediately contact any informants and sources in a position

to furnish information of this nature and forward to the Bureau in form suitable

(B) COMMUNIST PARTY, USA - 18TH NATIONAL CONVENTION -- You

have previously been advised that the Communist Party, USA, is preparing

to hold its 18th National Convention at Webster Hall in New York City on

June 22 through June 26, 1966. To attract youth and obtain the sanction of the .:

"liberal left," the Convention will endeavor to portray the Party as a legitimate

political organization. Every effort will be made at the Convention to depict

the Party as the vanguard of the "peace" and "civil rights" movements. As

in the past, the Convention will endeavor to identify the Party with the working

class and trade-union movement.

The Party is making an all-out effort toward making this the

most publicized National Convention ever held. A massive public campaign

is underway to obtain the widest possible dissemination of communist views

aimed at achieving legitimacy for the Party. Each Party district has been

given a liberal quota of Party observers and non-Party visitors from its

area. Additional plans are being formulated each day at the Party's National

Headquarters.

Various state and district organizations will hold conventions

in May and early June of this year for the purpose of selecting delegates to

the National Convention. Each state and district organization will be entitled

to one delegate, regardless of its size. In addition, each state and district

organization will be permitted to elect delegates on the basis of membership

determined by average dues payments computed during the period October 1,

1965, through March 31, 1966, as follows:

(1) For first 100 members, add one delegate for

each 20 members.

(2) For 101 to 350 members, add one delegate for

each 30 members.

(3) For 351 or more members, add one delegate for

each 35 members.

In addition, each district will be permitted one alternate

delegate for every two delegates. The national office of the Communist Party,

USA, contemplates that approximately 300 delegates and 150 alternate

delegates will attend the 18th National Convention.

In the past, two years' membership prior to the date of the

National Convention was required in order to be eligible for election as a

delegate to the National Convention. A referendum sponsored by the national

leadership is now being circulated in all Party areas changing the two-year

membership requirement to six months in an effort to afford more repre-

sentation to youth. Although certain districts have voiced opposition to this

change, it will most likely be adopted.

The next Nationa: Committee will be comprised of persons who

are delegates to the National Convention and, if we hope to penetrate the

National Committee with informant coverage, appropriate steps must be

taken at this time to insure that a number of our informants are selected by

state or district organizations as delegates to the National Convention.

Each office is instructed to advise by letter under the caption

"Communist Party, USA, Organization, 18th National Convention, Internal

Security - C" no. later than May 12, 1966, the identities of informants who

are in the best position to be selected as delegates to the 18th National

Convention, together with the plan of action contemplated to have specific

informants so selected.

It is essential that we have informants attending the National

Convention as delegates to insure proper coverage of this event and,

ultimately, penetration of the National Committee by informants to properly

cover the activities of this important policy-making body in the future.

The Bureau's responsibility to provide adequate coverage of

the National Convention and to promptly disseminate pertinent data developed

cannot be overemphasized. You are expected to afford this matter continuous

aggressive investigative attention and keep the Bureau advised of all pertinent

developments.

There are increasing indications that the public is losing

patience with the continued succession of demonstrations which have been

occurring in all parts of the nation. This rising tide of public indignation is

more and more creating waves of retributive action directed at the

demonstrators. Increasingly, irate spectators are rejecting their passive

roles and expressing their opposition and indignation toward the demonstrators

by attacking them physically.

On the other hand, leaders of many of the groups involved in

demonstrations have been exhorting their followers to more "direct action

tactics" to gain their ends. Thus, the demonstrations have been marked

by a growing militancy.

Clearly, the situation is one in which the conflict of interests

produces a growing tension. With summer approaching, the potentialities

for violent outbreaks will increase immeasurably, whether demonstrations

are directed at opposition toward United States foreign policy in Vietnam or

protests involving racial issues.

We must not only intensify and expand our coverage to insure

prompt and accurate reporting of violent outbreaks of this nature but also

to insure that advance signs of such outbreaks are detected and disseminated

to appropriate authorities.

I want to stress to you that the emphasis in these matters must

be on advance detection. Post mortem reporting is of secondary consequence.

We are an intelligence agency and as such are expected to know what is going

to or is likely to happen. National, state, and local authorities rely upon

us to obtain this information so they can take appropriate action to avert

disastrous outbreaks.

I am holding each Special Agent in Charge personally responsible

for the development and implementation of programs and procedures to fulfill

our responsibility. When a violent outbreak occurs and an analysis reveals

there were clear-cut signs of imminent violence that went undetected and un-

reported, the Special Agent in Charge will be called upon to explain the

reason for this failure and for his personal inadequacy.

(B) RECORD CHECKS OF TELEPHONE COMPANIES -- A Bureau field

office recently requested a confidential source at a local telephone company

to make available long distance toll call records relating to a subject under

investigation. A telephone clerk inadvertently forwarded the requested

records directly to the subject who in turn called the matter to the attention

of an attorney who over the years has attempted to thwart our investigations

and embarrass this Bureau, When the attorney made inquiries of the

telephone company the company, after consulting with its parent corporation,

advised the attorney the request for the toll call records had been initiated

by the FBI. The Bureau office was not advised of these facts until our

interest had been revealed.

In view of this incident, no request may be made of any

telephone company for a review of long distance telephone toll call records

without prior Bureau authority. In the future, if you desire to review long

distance toll call records a request under the substantive caption must be

submitted for Bureau approval prior to any contact with the telephone

company. Each request must include assurances that the review of the

telephone company records may be accomplished with full security and that

the Bureau's interest will be protected.

a statistical summary of its record holdings to the Department of Justice

for submission to the National Archives and Records Service of the General

Services Administration.

In order for the Bureau to compile this summary, each office

and Seat of Government division must furnish the following statistics in

the order set forth below.

(1) Volume of records in cubic feet on hand as of 7-1-64.

(2) Volume of records in cubic feet on hand as of 6-30-66.

(3) Volume of records in cubic feet disposed of during

the two-year period 7-1-64 to 6-30-66.

These figures should include the space reacquired as a result

of conversion to shelf filing as well as space reacquired by destruction of

record material. All records must be taken into consideration. Examples

of nonrecord material which need not be considered are preliminary work

sheets, ticklers, reference books, etc.

The Bureau is required to submit this statistical data to the

Department of Justice no later than 7-20-66; therefore, the field should

furnish these figures to the Bureau, Attention: Records Branch no later

than 7-8-66. It is not necessary to wait until the close of the fiscal year

to make the above computations.

are received from the courts, United States Attorneys or Government

agencies for costs of Bureau investigations. It recently has been necessary

for the Bureau to communicate with auxiliary offices involved in

investigations and request the required data because they have not taken

action based on the communication from the office of origin. Since there is

usually a very short deadline, due to the fact that the information is to be

used in court, all offices are to handle matters of this nature promptly in

the future in order that the Bureau can compute costs and advise the office

of origin within the required deadline, which in turn will furnish such

information to the source which requested it.

Your attention is also called to the fact that requests for cost

information are to be referred to the Bureau for a determination as to

whether such information is available or can be furnished. As pointed out

in the Manual of Rules and Regulations, in no instance should such

information be furnished without prior Bureau authority.

(E) MONTHLY ECONOMY REPORTS ON TRAVEL AND COMMUNICATIONS

COSTS-FBI FORM BCOK - Captioned report is being discontinued after

the report for the month of June 1966. However, those offices whose

submissions for June are incomplete should submit final revised figures

by August 15, 1966.

In lieu of such reports the Bureau intends to keep a close

watch on travel costs and to require explanations from offices whose costs

appear to be too high. With respect to communications costs it appears

likely that we will expand the usage of General Services Administration

communications facilities for long-distance messages with consequent

centralized billing for such costs to the Bureau at the Seat of Government.

In that event offices will have billing records of only the charges for local

service and equipment in use, billed through field office by the telephone

companies. The Bureau will continue to exercise the same close control

over such equipment as in the past.

Offices participating in the Federal Telecommunications

System will be expected to maintain records and submit quarterly reports

to the Bureau showing monthly volume of long-distance traffic on that

system. To assure the Bureau's expenditures for telephone and teletype

message service will be maintained at the lowest level possible, you will

be expected to exercise continuing administrative control over local and

facilities are used excessively; that long-distance telephone and teletype

are used only when necessary and not as a substitute for the exchange of

information by mail.

(F) NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMPANY - TELEVISION PROGRAM ON

CRIME CONDITIONS -- The Bureau has received information indicating that

the National Broadcasting Company is preparing a three-hour special television

program dealing with crime conditions in the United States which will be

presented nationwide next August. It is quite possible that representatives

of this program may contact local FBI offices for the purpose of gathering

material.

In the event such inquiries are received by you, the representative

should be treated courteously but no information should be furnished. He should

be politely requested to direct his inquiry to the Bureau. You should, of

course, promptly advise the Bureau if you or personnel of your office are

(G) BUREAU APPLICANTS - SPECIAL AGENT RECRUITMENT

PROGRAM -- As a result of an extremely successful Special Agent

Recruitment Program, we now have a sufficient number of qualified

Special Agent applicants under consideration to fill our limited vacancies

through November, 1966. For those applicants who are willing to wait

for vacancies which will occur after November, 1966, I have scheduled

the following classes for the remainder of fiscal year 1967: December

12, 1966; January 9, 1967; February 13, 1967; March 13, 1967; April 24,

1967; May 22, 1967; and June 26, 1967.

In view of the foregoing, you should not place under investi-

gation any applicant who is not available for the class scheduled in

December or one of the subsequent classes. On those applicants who

have been favorably recommended and who are only interested in immedi-

ate employment, they should be informed that we have no existing vacancies;

however, their interest will be made a matter of record. You should

forward their related papers to the Bureau. In connection with those appli-

cants favorably recommended whose papers have been forwarded to the

• Bureau for further consideration, specific instructions will be furnished

to you concerning their processing. You should not contact any applicant

currently under investigation regarding his availability date until advised

to do so by the Bureau. For your information, the Bureau will continue

its policy of offering appointments to applicants, found qualified, six

months in advance of their availability date. A 21-day deadline should be

set on investigations instituted on those applicants available for the above-

mentioned classes.

(H) COLLECTION OF POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION CON-

CERNING CHINA -- The United States Intelligence Board (USIB) has

placed China on the same priority as that of the Soviet Union in collection

of positive intelligence information. The Board has pointed out to its

members that a recent analysis of information collected by U. S:

intelligence agencies concerning Communist China indicates a definite lack

of and need for information concerning Chinese communist capabilities.

In support of this need, the Board has listed ten critical questions and the

present state of the U. S. Government's knowledge for each of these

questions. In no instance is U. S. knowledge rated better than good and

for the most part only fair to poor. Under our present program "Chinese

Aliens Entering the U. S. " we have an excellent opportunity to provide

pertinent information in answer to some of these questions. These

highest priority questions, classified "Tòp Secret" by USIB, are as follows:

(1) Chinese intentions as to subversive activities in non-

communist world, including support of insurgency, (2) Overall development

of science and technology, (3) Chinese intentions as to military action

against adjacent areas, (4) Estimated Chinese response to possible U. S.

courses of action, such as U. S. deployment programs in Southeast Asia,

(5) Progress in development of advanced weapons, (6) Capabilities of

Chinese military forces, (7) Economy, especially

food-population problem,

(8) Peking's relationship with other communist governments and Communist

Parties, (9) MAO Tse-tung's successors, their policies, differences and

stability, (10) Popular morale in China and the potential for resistance.

It is realized that the Bureau is not expected or in a position

to obtain information concerning all of these questions. However, through

searching interviews under our alien program we have the opportunity to

provide the U. S. intelligence community information with respect to morale

in China, the potential for resistance, economy, industry, education and the

food-population problem.

Information developed on the above questions in any of these

categories should be incorporated promptly into letterhead memorandum

suitable for dissemination.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(B) TRAVEL - REDUCED AIR FARES -- The United States General Accounting

Office by letter dated May 25, 1966, to the various Government agencies,

advised that effective March 27, 1966, all of the eleven domestic trunk air-

lines and one local service carrier (Mohawk Airlines) reduced fares by 25

per cent for round-trip travel via their respective lines. These reduced

rates are subject to certain conditions; however, in most instances they will

apply to travel in any class of service except jet first-class. It is anticipated

• that these reduced fares will remain in effect until December 31, 1966, with

a good possibility that they will be extended.

The reduced air fares are valid only on flights scheduled to

depart not earlier than noon Monday and not later than noon Friday and not

earlier than noon Saturday and not later than noon Sunday. In other words,

the reduced fares are in effect from 12:00 noon on Monday through 12:00 noon

on Friday. For the weekend, they are valid from 12:00 noon Saturday

through 12:00 noon Sunday. In addition, they will not be available during

holiday periods, most of the month of June, and the entire month of August.

Furthermore, return travel may not start earlier than 12:01 a.m. on the

Sunday following the passenger's departure from point of origin and all travel

must be completed not later than midnight of the 30th day following the date

the transportation commences.

*:.

Round-trip excursion fares apply only when tickets are pur-

chased at such fares prior to departure from point of origin. Therefore, in

cases where it is determined that the travel will be performed within the

excursion fare period the Government Transportation Request should specify

"Excursion Fare." In those instances where it is definitely known that travel

will not be performed within the excursion fare period, the transportation

request should specify "Regular Fare." In those instances where the round-

trip commences within the excursion fare period but there is doubt as to the

actual date of return, the Government Transportation Request should be

issued to show "Excursion Fare." Should it develop that the return trip

does not come within the excursion fare period, any difference in cost

between the excursion fare and the regular fare must be paid. A Government

Transportation Request may be issued to upgrade the ticket or the difference

may be paid in cash and reclaimed on the traveler's expense voucher.

Notwithstanding the fact there are limitations on the applicable

period for the reduced air fares it should be possible for a certain amount

of official round-trip travel to be performed at the reduced fares. All

employees of your office who have occasion to perform official travel are

to be advised of these reduced air fares and that where possible all air

travel reservations should be made to take advantage of the savings that are

possible through use of the round-trip excursion tickets.

(C) U.S. SAVINGS BONDS CAMPAIGN -- 1966 -- The President has requested

extension of the bond drive through June since the results in some agencies

disclose they failed to meet the minimum 75 per cent participation rate goal.

The Chairman of the drive has indicated the President's disappointment and

has emphasized that the President is personally interested and daily checks

charts regarding progress of agencies. Participation in this worthwhile

savings program helps to stabilize the country's economy. Deductions for

• bond purchases under the payroll savings plan are a service which agencies

provide for their employees.

If all nonparticipants signed up for the

minimum of $3. 75 per pay period, such action would certainly demonstrate

interest on the part of employees to help the Nation as well as themselves

in this patriotic endeavor.

The Department of Justice announced its overall

participation rate had risen to 54. 9 per cent as of June 3, 1966, and that the

(D) INTERVIEWS OF SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRANTS BY ARMY

REPRESENTATIVES -- Under current U. S. Army procedures, when a

Selective Service registrant is called for preinduction processing at an

Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station, he is required to fill out a

DD Form 398 (Statement of Personal History) and a DD Form 98 (Armed

Forces Security Questionnaire). On many occasions, a registrant will

qualify these forms by either listing some adverse subversive information

about a relative or by listing membership on his part in an organization

designated by the Attorney General. Past experience has shown that in

a great number of these cases, the qualification of these forms has been

the result of either an overconscientious registrant making a mistake or

an apparent deliberate attempt on a registrant's part to be rejected because

of a nonexistent subversive background. Past experience has also shown

that when a registrant qualifies a form, processing of the individual is

stopped, the registrant is sent home and often a period of months elapses

before he is investigated, located, and interviewed. In most instances,

the matter can be resolved by an on-the-spot interview at the Armed

Forces Examining and Entrance Station.

This matter has been discussed with appropriate representatives

of the Department of the Army. It was agreed that it is essential that Army

continue to obtain FBI concurrence prior to conducting any investigation of

registrants who have qualified or refused to complete their security forms

in order not to interfere with or compromise any investigation the FBi may

be conducting of the registrant or his relatives. FBI concurrence, how-

ever, is not necessary merely to conduct an interview which strives to

immediately clarify and resolve a registrant's qualification of a form and/or

ascertain his reasons for refusal to complete the form.

In the cases of Bureau informants who are under consideration

for induction into the Armed Forces, you are instructed to continue the

policy of having such individuals advise your Office of their imminent induction.

In the event a problem is involved regarding the execution of required forms

by an informant, the facts should be submitted to the Bureau with your

recommendation as to appropriate action. In this connection, your attention

is directed to Section 107P of the Manual of Instructions, captioned "Signing

of Loyalty Oaths, Affidavits, and Statements."

(E) COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF LABOR UNIONS -- Since its inception,

the Communist Party, USA, in line with communist theory, has held labor

unions to be a medium through which a nation's economy can be weakened

to such an extent that communists could seize control of that nation.

During the late 1930s and early 1940s the Communist Party,

USA, successfully infiltrated and developed a position of control within a

number of powerful labor unions. Subsequent to this period, labor legislation

was enacted which made it increasingly difficult for Party members to hold

union office and which denied the services of the National Labor Relations

Board to communist-infiltrated labor unions.

Recent United States Supreme Court decisions, however, have

nullified the anticipated effect of such legislation. Subsequent to the November

15, 1965, Supreme Court decision which held that the membership provision

of the Internal Security Act of 1950 was unenforceable, Gus Hall, General

Secretary, Communist Party, USA, announced that the Party would now

expand, become more active and would soon issue its new program to the

American people.

Pages 46 through 50 of the draft of the "New Program of the

Communist Party U.S, A. " stress the importance of labor within the

communist movement by cleverly pitting the "working class" against

"monopoly." Analysis of this passage clearly reveals it is designed to

create an unbridgeable division between the "capitalists" and the "workers"

which would cause an inevitable clash with the "workers," championed

by the communists, emerging victoriously.

It is anticipated that the Party's interest in regaining positions

of control within labor unions in this country will be strongly stressed

during the Party's forthcoming 18th National Convention, scheduled to be

held in New York, New York, from June 22 through June 26, 1966.

In view of this, each office is instructed to take full cognizance

of the Party's renewed interest in labor. Each office should accordingly

take appropriate action necessary to achieve complete coverage of any

attempts by the Party to regain positions of control within labor unions

or otherwise attempt to infiltrate these unions:

(A) ZIP CODE - WANTED FLYERS AND IDENTIFICATION ORDERS -

ADDRESSOGRAPH -- Effective January 1, 1967, postal regulations will re-

quire that all addresses contain zip code; that no numbers, letters or

characters of any kind follow the zip code number on the same line or appear

anywhere below the zip code in the mailing address. This requirement is

necessary since automatic scanning equipment, which the Post Office Depart-

ment is in the process of installing, will not function properly unless above

procedure is adhered to.

Accordingly, as of July 1, 1966, all offices should discontinue

printing their local telephone number on the bottom of Wanted Flyers and

Identification Orders and after above date they will be folded so as to eliminate

space for this purpose. The Field Office designation letters such as AL for

Albany will be permissible and are not to be removed. However, they must

always be at least one line above the zip code number, preferably on the

top line of the address. In eliminating the telephone number from Wanted

Flyers, simply remove the separate "date plate" from the addressograph

machine and destroy it.

Elimination of the telephone number from Identification Orders

can be done as follows: (1) Offices using KK style plates, remove the bottom

section containing the telephone number and destroy it. (2) Offices using

any style plates other than KK can remove the last two lines from the rubber

platen which will prevent the telephone number from printing when the

Identification Orders are addressed. To do this, trim off a strip of the

rubber approximately 3/8" wide from the bottom of the platen. This pro-

cedure has been followed at the Bureau for a number of years with excellent

results. Any office which experiences trouble trimming and adjusting the

plater should contact the local addressograph representative for assistance.

It is not anticipated that it will be necessary to make new plates.

The changeover date of July 1, 1966, will enable all field offices,

as well as the Seat of Government, to make required changes and adjustments

prior to the effective date. All plates ordered thereafter should specify

address and field office designation only. Any office encountering a problem

in regard to this change should direct a request for assistance to the Bureau,

It is desired at this time that you determine the number of

In March, 1966, according to information received by

the Canadian Government, ia Special Agent) of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation entered Canada to pursue an inquiry relating to the

Selective Service status of Malcolm Briscoe who was then residing

in British Columbia. On the basis of the information available

to the Canadian Government it would appear that (the Special

Agent), in pursuing this inquiry, departed from the usual practices

between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Federal Bureau

of Investigation. It will be appreciated that an essential feature

of the normal practices between the two agencies in matters of

this kind is that neither agency will attempt to conduct inquiries

in each other's jurisdiction without seeking permission through

appropriate channels in each case and that further, as a general

rule, the actual inquiry will be made by the agency having

jurisdiction in the area of the inquiry. On some occasions

officers of both agencies are present at a particular inquiry.

These practices, which are reciprocal, do not provide for the

unaccompanied conduct of an inquiry by representatives of either

of the agencies in the jurisdiction of the other.

It is regrettable that on this occasion the established

practices were not followed. The Canadian Government considers

that it is in the mutual interests of our two Governments that

in this sensitive area there be no departure from the established

procedures which are designed to provide a proper framework

for the essential cooperation between these important agencies

of our two Governments with full respect for the authority of

each agency and for the rights of the citizens of both countries.

(D) CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR INVESTIGATIONS - SELECTIVE SERVICE

MATTERS -- Prompt objective-type investigations must be conducted in

Conscientious Objector cases. Organizational activity, such as Students for

a Democratic Society, in protesting military action in Vietnam, has resorted

to making known to all persons of draft age current regulations of Selective

Service regarding draft deferments. This has resulted in a substantial

increase in the number of Conscientious Objector cases.

It is imperative we develop fully all information concerning the

registrant's sincerity and association with any subversive organization,

individual or publication. As summaries of our investigations are furnished

to Selective Service and to the registrant, extreme caution should be taken

to protect our informants. Wherever possible, information from informants

should be utilized for lead purposes, thereby reducing the need for classifying

many reports as confidential. Information from informants can frequently

pinpoint public source data and/or the identities of individuals who can furnish

substantially the same information as the informant and who are available

as witnesses if needed. In this connection, the Bureau has been in close

contact with the Department and, by virtue of a recent Supreme Court

decision, the Department is obligated to furnish to the registrant detailed

information regarding our investigations. If public source material is

utilized to a greater degree, it would result in the reduction of classified

information and furnish far

more information to Selective Service officials

on which to base an opinion regarding the registrant's sincerity. All of the

registrant's references, where no information exists that would preclude

contact, must be interviewed to prevent any claim by the registrant that the

FBI did not conduct a full, unbiased inquiry concerning his sincerity and

religious beliefs. Unavailability of a reference must be set forth in the

details of the report and expanded in the cover pages as necessary.

Current employment of the registrant must be ascertained. If

defense-connected, the extent of participation and knowledge of registrant

must be developed.

Conscientious Objector cases are not criminal investigations

and complete investigations must, in all instances, reflect a clear determination

of the registrant's character and good faith.

(E) THEFT FROM INTERSTATE SHIPMENT (TFIS; MATTERS -- The U. S.

Supreme Court on May 23, 1966, in the case of the United States v. John W.

Cook, ruled by unanimous decision that Section 660, Title 18, U. S. Code,

encompasses embezzlement by employees of individually owned common

• carriers. This decision resulted from a jurisdictional statement submitted

by the Department in the Cook case requesting clarification of the employee

embezzlement section of the TFIS Stattte.

This most recent decision by the U. S. Supreme Court will now

extend our investigative jurisdiction of employee embezzlement under Section

660, Title 18, U. S. Code, to include privately owner common carriers and

those owned in partnership which were previously not considered to be in

violation of the TFIS Statute.

This recent Supreme Court decision should be immediately brought

to the attention of all investigative persornel and appropriate liaison should

be instituted with all common carriers which will now be included within the

scope of our investigat-ve jurisdiction under Section 660. Manual changes

are being prepared.

(F) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently, a field office

failed to obtain prior Bureau authority in connection with the activity of a

high-ranking Kian informant who resigned from his position as a Klan official

and was attempting to form a new organization. His activity was not in

keeping with the Bureau's over-all objectives in Klan investigations.

Obviously, high-ranking Klan informants serve a valuable

purpose. Permitting them to drastically change their status affects the

Bureau's Klan coverage and may affect operations being directed against

the national Klan organization. In dealing with sources holding top-level

positions, Agents must be alert for any situation of this type and present

the full facts to the Bureau before action is taken.

In addition, you should insure that your office has a practice of

keeping Agents posted on a regular basis of significant Klan developments

as well as the objectives of your office in Klan investigations in order that

they may operate and direct the activities of their informants in line with

these objectives.

Review of correspondence reveals that some racial informants

are not authenticating their reports. This indicates that they have not been

indoctrinated to the degree where they have complete contidence in the FBI.

This matter must be brought to the attention of all Agents, and

it should be impressed upon them that racial informants should be controlled

and operated in such a manner that they develop compiete confidence in the

Agent who is handling them and show this confidence in their attitude toward

the Bureau. One indication of confidence in the FBI would be authenticating

reports.

It should be impressed upon informants through their contact

with Agents that the purpose of signing a report is to afford them the

opportunity to insure that the data furnished has been recorded accurately.

In addition, the confidential nature of the FBI files and the security precautions

the Bureau takes to protect information should also be impressed upon them.

Special Agents not only should collect information from informants,

but also should be aware of their activities and maintain a close relationship

in order to know what the informants are thinking with regard to Bureau

matters. Activities since the previous contact should be carefully reviewed

to make certain informants furnish in writing or verbally all information they

have obtained since the last contact.

A review of recent correspondence indicates greater care regarding

the following would expedite the handling of informant mail.

(1) In connection with recommendation to remove an

individual from probation, it is necessary for your

office to satisfy itself through investigation and con-

tacts that the informant is not a plant and can be

operated in the future without danger of embarrassment

to the Bureau. A statement to this effect must be

included in your communication.

(2) In payment letters, previous payments for

services and expenses should be broken down to

show the amounts paid for each.

(3). In the progress letters under "Number of Written

and Oral Statements Submitted," it is only necessary

to show the actual number of each. Details regarding

each report are not desired. A summary of the con-

tents of the reports should be set out under the heading

"Summary of Information Furnished."

(4) Insure that your payment letters contain a state-

ment as to what percentage of the information furnished

has been verified through other sources.

(5) Insure that payments are made in direct proportion

to the value of the information furnished. In addition,

informants should be paid in such a manner that they

clearly understand they are being paid on a C.O.D.

basis and not on a salary basis.

Each Special Agent should realize the importance of this operation.

Proper handling of an informant requires that he be given close supervision

and control. It also requires positive thinking in order that the Bureau will

placed and properly guided to obtain the data the Bureau requires to fulfill

its responsibilities in the racial field.

(A) CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS -- Your attention is directed to the

diversion by U. S. Attorneys of subjects in Bureau cases to local and

military authorities for prosecution. In the event local or military

authorities fail to follow through with prosecution, the offender will

not be punished for his criminal activity.

In an effort to determine the extent of this situation the

Bureau desires the following procedure be initiated by each office on a

trial six-month basis.

At the time of presentation of a case to the U. S. Attorney

and where he declines prosecution in favor of local or military handling,

an expression is to be secured from him as to whether in the event local

or military prosecution is not initiated he will reconsider his declination.

If he agrees, the case is to be maintained in a pending status until

prosecution by local or military authorities is completed. Should these

authorities not take action after the subject is turned over to them for

handling, the U. S. Attorney is to be recontacted in line with his

previous commitment to reconsider.

This procedure is to be kept in effect for a period of

six months from the date of this SAC Letter. At the expiration of

this period the Bureau is to be advised of the results of this procedure

including the identity of specific cases where U. S. Attorneys sub-

sequently authorize upon recontact. Your recommendations are also

of guilty and more cases going to trial. If this happens, we may expect more

frequent defense challenges to the legality of our arrests and the reasonableness

of our searches and seizures. Aside from confessions, the arrests and

searches are the principal points of defense attack in criminal cases.

With respect to searches and seizures, all field Agents were given

Special training in their offices during 1965 as instructed in SAC Letter 65-40.

Additionally, written material on this subject has been given to all offices in

Training Document No. 61 entitled 'The Federal Law on Search and Seizure,"

and in the recent pamphlet on "Search of the Person" which reprinted articles

from the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin. All of this material should be

constantly available to investigative personnel; it contains nothing of a classified

nature.

As to the law of arrest, a study of 100 recent arrest cases heard in

the Federal courts, chosen at random, revealed that in two-thirds of those

cases the principal question at issue, or the only question, was probable cause

for the arrest. More specifically, in cases of arrest without a warrant, did

there exist, at the moment of arrest, sufficient information to justify the

conclusion of the officers that the accused had committed a crime? Or, in

case of arrest with a warrant, did the complaint on which the warrant was

based state, on its face, facts sufficient to show probable cause? The

conclusion is obvious; special attention must be given to this subject. The

law-trained Special Agents who attended the Specialized Legal In-Service

which opened on June 13, 1966, have been given special training, with a text,

on probable cause as it applies to all arrests, affidavits for search warrants,

and searches of mobile vehicles on probable cause. You are hereby instructed

that these Agents, assisted if necessary by those who have attended either of

the two previous Specialized Legal In-Service classes, are to give all Agents

of your office special instructions in probable cause, in addition to a

discussion of the new rule concerning statements relating to guilt. Follow

generally, the plan outlined in SAC Letter 65-40, mentioned earlier.

NW 55041 Docid: 32989525

Page 160

## Page 161

A minimum of four hours of instruction must be given. Most of the time is

to be spent on probable cause. The rule on statements regarding guilt is

important but it does not differ substantially from long-standing practice of

this Bureau (see SAC Letter 66-38), and certain questions left unanswered

by the Court must necessarily be resolved by subsequent court decisions

and advice from the Department.

Initiate this instruction promptly, complete it by September 1,

1966, and advise the Bureau by letter, Attention: Training Division, on

completion.

You are instructed also that, effective immediately, for all

complaints for arrest warrants and affidavits for search warrants, the

Agent must prepare a written statement of sufficient facts of probable

cause and have it checked by the United States Attorney or an assistant

before filing with the United States Commissioner. Agents outside head-

quarters city may check the wording of their complaint or affidavit with

the United States Attorney when obtaining permission to file. See SAC

Letters 58-44 (B), 58-49 (F), 58-60 (G) and 58-80 (D) which were written

after the Supreme Court reversed a conviction in a narcotics case because

•the complaint for the arrest warrant failed to state probable cause. At

that time the Department instructed all United States Attorneys, on

September 22, 1958, to review complaints filed by Federal officers to

make sure that probable cause was stated. If any United States Attorney,

or assistant, refuses at this time to review your complaints and affidavits.

advise the Bureau promptly in all necessary detail and we will ask the cooperation

of the Department in reissuing their instructions.

SAC LETTER 66-41

(B) TRAINING - POLICE - LEGAL MATTERS -- In view of recent Supreme

Court decisions which have a profound effect upon the workaday duties of

law enforcement officers, it is imperative that they understand and abide by

those rulings. Our field police training program affords Bureau an excellent

forum through which we may alleviate the confusion encountered by police in

attempting to comply with current rulings regarding arrests, interrogations,

and searches and seizures.

With completion of the recent Specialized Legal In-Service,

Bureau has an enlarged corps of police instructors on legal topics and it

is your

responsibility to insure maximum use of their training. Instruction

in the legal field should be an integral part of your over-all police training

program. You may schedule specialized schools on local and/or regional

bases or incorporate the instruction into Basic, Recruit, In-Service,

et cetera, schools. The instruction should include the three elements:

Probable Cause for Arrest, Due Process in Criminal Interrogation, and

Search and Seizure.

A competent, well-trained force of police officers is a potent

force in obviating allegations of improper performance by law enforcement

representatives. Providing instruction on above-mentioned topics is an

area in which Bureau does, and must continue to, excel.

You should make

certain your division takes an aggressive stand in furnishing instruction in

this field.

(C) BUREAU INVESTIGATIONS IN NATIONAL FIREARMS ACT AND

the Bureau's instructions as set forth in SAC Letter #65-10, dated 3/9/65,

and captioned, "(B) INVESTIGATION OF RACIAL MATTERS AND HATE

GROUPS - CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS. "

Information that is received by the Bureau concerning possible

violations of the National Firearms Act or Federal Firearms Act relating

to any investigation over which the Bureau has primary investigative

jurisdiction is to be immediately investigated by the Bureau. This will

include information of National or Federal Firearms Act violations

developed during racial investigations, Klan and other hate-type groups.

These cases are not to be referred to Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division

(ATTD) for it to investigate; however, there will be instances where it

will be necessary to advise ATTD of the fact that the Bureau is conducting

a National Firearms Act or Federal Firearms Act investigation.

Information concerning convictions obtained by the Bureau in

National and Federal Firearms Act cases is still to be disseminated in

appropriate form to your local office of the ATTD.

(D) HARASSMENT OF BUREAU AGENTS BY THE KLAN - RACIAL MATTERS

(KLAN) - There is every indication that the Klan is continuing and, in

fact, increasing its efforts to harass and intimidate the Special Agents

conducting racial and Klan investigations. This harassment ranges from

open hostility and verbal abuse to activities which border on physical assault.

Recently, Agents conducting surveillance of a klansman were

involved in an accident which was apparently intentionally caused by a car

being driven by a klansman. Fortunately, no injuries resulted.

On other occasions, telephone conversations between klansmen

and Special Agents were recorded as well as interviews between klansmen

and our Agents. Our informants advise that the Klan has discussed such

things as causing accidents to Bureau cars, threatening to shoot Agents

who come onto the property of a klansman, and putting sugar in the gas

tanks of Bureau cars.

In addition to the above, the Klan has discussed

in the past, and is still contemplating, other tactics which may cause

embarrassment or possibly physical harm to the Special Agents.

I am cognizant of the hostility which exists in certain areas of

the country because of the Bureau's involvement in enforcing civil rights

legislation and conducting investigations concerning Klan organizations.

It is obvious that our intensive investigations are hurting the Klan. We

have been effective in penetrating the various Klan organizations and this

success must be continued. Our investigations must not be lessened;

however, we should be alert to the Klan's attempts to embarrass the Bureau

in order that appropriate action can be taken to nullify these attempts.

You are reminded that telephone conversations and interviews

of klansmen are to be conducted under secure conditions and in a business-

like manner which will leave no possibility of any embarrassing reper-

cussions. In addition, you should be alert for any actions on the part of

the Klan to harass Agents and appropriate steps should be taken to thwart

these attempts.

The Bureau should be notified immediately in all instances

where information is received concerning plans of the Klan to harass Agents.

At such time as the Klan carries out a harassment tactic, advise the Bureau

and indicate what steps you recommend should be taken. It is recognized

that in some situations good judgment would dictate no retaliation. Of

course, you should be aware that klansmen who violate certain Federal

laws such as assault, interfering with or threatening a Federal officer

and destruction of government property should be handled in accordance

with the policy governing these statutes. In addition, you should be cognizant

of proposed violations of local statutes and action should be taken in

cooperation with authorities having jurisdiction over these statutes.

As our intensive investigations are continued in the Klan,

civil rights, and racial matters fields, you may expect that there will be

corresponding efforts by the Klan to retaliate against the Bureau and its

Agents. Be ever alert for these possibilities, use good judgment, and

take whatever action is reasonable under the circumstances in line with

Bureau policy.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

RE: TELEPHONE CALL TRACING

The Bell System has undertaken a comprehensive program to com-

bat use of the telephone for annoyance calls of all types. As part of this program,

American Telephone and Telegraph Company has directed the Operating

Companies of the Bell System to abandon the past generally negative attitude

regarding cail tracing and to implement a positive aggressive policy directed

toward identification of calling lines from which annoyance calls are made.

Particular emphasis has been placed on the need to successfully trace those

telephone calls which are abusive, harassing, obscene or threatening to life

or property.

In order that you will be aware of the scope of the Bell System

annoyance cail program and alert to publicity which may result from it, the

major facets of the program are being set forth for your information.

Specifically, the program calls for: (1) Training of telephone

company personnel to handle annoyance call complaints; (2) establishment of

administrative procedures for handling operational, legal and technical problems

which may arise in processing of any annoyance call complaint; (3) use of

trained technicians and all available technical aids in tracing annoyance calls

io their source; (4) prosecution of offenders in jurisdictions where criminal

statules are violated; and (5) publicizing the program by newspaper articles

and by a national advertising campaign to begin in the immediate future.

Officials of American Telephone and Telegraph Company have

advised that they have no new device. equipment or techrique to automatically

insure the successiul identification of a calling line in the different types of

swilching equipment used or to automaticaliy effect a call trace between difierent

exchanges in metropolitan areas, Call tracing must still be accomplished by the

application of those cail tracing aids particularly suited to a local telephone

system and to the equipment used in it.

American Telephone and Telegraph Company has taken steps to

insure that each local telephone unit of the Bell System does have available the

best suited aids for its call tracing applications. It has evaluated the many

devices designed to aid in call tracing and has supplied the Operating Companies

NW 55041 DooId: 32989525 Page 166

---

## Page 167

with descriptions, specifications, limitations, installation instructions and

sources of supply for the devices recommended for Bell System use. This has

enabled each Operating Company to select those devices most applicable for use

with its equipment and to have available for use those call tracing aids which

most increase the probability of successful identification of calling lines.

With the application of the best currently available call tracing

devices and techniques, call tracing still remains a technically difficult and

uncertain operation. However, the new impetus given to call tracing under the

Bell System annoyance call program, the use of best available technical aids

to call tracing and training of telephone company technicians in call tracing

procedures should result in an increased call tracing capability in Operating

Companies of the Bell System. You should be alert to any change in call

tracing capability which may result in local Bell System Operating Companies

in your area and should be guided accordingly in investigative situations which

might warrant attempts to trace the source of telephone calls.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(A) FRED B. BLACK, JR. - ANTIRACKETEERING -- There is attached

for your information a copy of the Supplemental Memorandum filed by

the Department of Justice with the United States Supreme Court on July

13, 1966, in captioned case. In the event any inquiries are directed to

you in connection with this matter, you should make no comment but

direct the inquirer's attention to that portion of Page 3, paragraph 1,

authorization to the FBI for listening devices in the following words:

"Under Departmental practice in effect for a

period of years prior to 1963, and continuing into 1965,

the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was

given authority to approve the installation of devices

such as that in question for intelligence (and not

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF TH: UNITED STATES

OCTOBER. TEM,

1966

No. 1029, October Term, 1965

FRED B. BLACK, JR.,

PETITIONER

v.

UNITED STATES

OF AMERICA

SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM FOR THE UNITED STATES

This supplemental memorandum is submitted in

response to this Court's order

of June 13, 1966, requesting

"a response from the Government in this case, not

Limited

to, but directed

in particular toward the kind of apparatus

used by the Government; the person or persons who authorized

it's

installation; the statute or Executive Order relied

upon; the date or dates of installation; whether there is

in existence a recording of conversations heard; when the

information concerning petitioner came into the hands of

any attorney for the government

and to which ones, as well

as what use was made of the information in the case against

petitioner."

The listening device referred to in our

memorandum of May 24, 1966, was a tubular microphone which

was installed through the common

wall of a room adjoining

the suite occupied by petitioner

at

the sheraton-Carlton

Hotel in washington, D. C. The microphone extended through

• the six-inch common wall and one-fourth of an

inch into

the one-half inch molding of petitioner's suite. It was

installed on the, afternoon of February 7, 1963, and agents.

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation began to monitor

conversations in petitioner's suite on the afternoon of

the following day.

The installation was removed and the

monitoring was terminated on April 25, 1963.

No recording of any portion of the monitored

conversations exists today. The assignment of the monitoring

agents was

to keep

a contemporaneous log

in which were

summarized the conversations in petitioner's suite. A

tape recorder

was available and was used to record particular

conversations whenever a monitoring agent felt that such a

recording

would be helpful in preparing his summaries:

After the summaries were prepared, the used tape was erased.

While none of the recordings are, consequently,

available today, the handwritten notes of the monitoring

agents do exist.

These notes summarize the conversations

and, in some instances, contain excerpts from conversations.

2. No specific statute or executive order was

relied upon in the installation of the listening device

in question. Under 5 U.s.C. 300, the Attorney General has .

the authority to appoint officials for the detection and

prosecution of crimes against the United States.

carrying out this responsibility, Attorneys General have

delegated to the Director of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation the duty to gather intelligence, to investigate

violations of federal laws, and to collect evidence in cases

in which the United States is or may be a party. See 28 C.f.

in each instance.

No similar procedure

existed until 1965 with

respect to the use

of devices

such as. those involved in the instant case, although records

of oral and written communications within the Department of

Justice

reflect concern by Attorneys General and the Direc-

tor of the federal Bureau of Investigation that the use of

a strictly limited category of situations. Under

establishment, prohibits the use of such listening devices

(as wail as the intercuption of telephone and other wire

communications)

all instances other than those involving

the collection of intelligence affecting the national

security.

The specific authorization of the Attorney

General must be obtained in each instance when this

exception

is

invoked.

3. The information concerning petitioner obtained

by the monitoring agents was submitted to their superiors in

the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the form of the logs

previously mentioned. Some of this information was then

incorporated

into two reports and two memoranda captioned

"anti-racketeering" since these dealt with petitioner's possible

affiliation with organized criminal activity in the United

States.

The reports; dated April. 17, 1963, and July 12,

1963, were transmitted by the Federal Bureau of Investiga-

tion to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice,

and the memoranda, dated April 5, 1963, and April 9, 1963,

were sent to the Attorney General with copies to the

Criminal Division. The date on which the April 1963 report

was received by attorneys in the Organized Crime ana

Racketeering Section is not known,

but it was transmitted

to the Office

of the Assistant Attorney

General in charge

of the Criminal Division, where it was received on

November 6, 1963.

The july 1963 report was received in

the Organized Crime & Racketeering Section on August 2, 1963,

and in the Office of the Assistant Attorney General in

charge of the Criminal Division on October 28, 1963.

memoranda were received in the Office of the Attorney

General on April 5 and April 9, 1963, respectively.

Neither the reports nor the memoranda were seen by

attorneys of the tax Division responsible for the prosecution

of the tax evasion charges against petitioner until

January 1964 when, in preparing

for trial, they requested

fom the Criminal Division such material as the latter possessed

concerning

petitioner.

The F.B.I. reports and memoranda

were included in the material transmitted pursuant.to this

request.

They were

received and examined by the lax Division

attorneys

some time between January 31, 1964, and April 15,

1964, when petitioner's trial began.

The bulk of the information contained in the

reports had been obtained from sources other than the

monitoring.

Neither the reports nor the memoranda indicated.

that any portion of the information was derived

from a

listening device.

The Tax Division

attorneys found nothing

in the

F.B.I. reports or memoranda which they considered relevant

to the tax evasion case.

No information from these reports

or memoranda (whether obtained from the listening device

ox from any other source) was used by government counsei

in petitioner's tax-evasion trial. The charges against

petitioner in this case were based upon his failure to

include in his income tax returns for 1956 through

1959

certain specific items of

income. The proof that petitioner"

• had received these items in those tax years was obtained not

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation but by agents of the

Internal Revenue Service in an invastigation begun in the spring

of 1960 and concluded late in 1962. On December 12, 1962,

the Internal Revenue Service referred the case to the Tax

Division of the Department of Justice for criminal

prosecution. All evidence produced by the government at

petitioner's trial was detailed

in an

accompanying

report

of the Internal Revenue Service. Neither additional

evidence nor. any lead to additional evidence was obtained

from the F.B.I. reports and memoranda.

In connection with an inquiry on an unrelated

matter; the F.B.I. informed the Attorney General and the

"Criminal Division in late August 1965 that a listening

device had been installed in petitioner's hotel suite.

The logs were then

obtained and reviewed within the Criminal

Division in connection with the unrelated matter. However,

the fact that conversations between petitioner and counsel

whom he had then retained had been overheard was not noted

by any attorney in the Department of Justice until after

April 21, 1966, when the logs were again

exanined, this

time by attorneys in the Tax Division who were

familiar with

the history of petitioner's case, they completed their

review in

early May and brought this fact to the attention

of the Attorney General. At his direction, the solicitor

General was advised on May 10, 1066, that a listening device

had been in operation in petitioner's hotel suite and that

such conversations had been overheard, and our memorand. of

May 24, 2966,

was accordingly filed in this Court.

(E) BUREAU APPLICANTS - CLERICAL APPLICANT RECRUITMENT

PROGRAM -- On January 28, 1966, by SAC Letter 66-7 you were advised

of the Bureau's concern over the number of appointments declined and

steps to be taken by you in this matter. A recent survey of clerical

appointments for employment at Seat of Government offered and declined

revealed the following main reasons given by the applicants: (1) To accept

other employment; (2, To continue education; (3) Appointee decided not

to come to Washington, D. C.; (4) Parents refused to allow appointee to

come to Washington, D. C.; (5; Financial reasons; í6; Marriage.

In order to keep our appointments at the highest possible

level of acceptance it is imperative that interviews of prospective applicants

be well planned and most penetrative. Any weakness or indecision on the

part of an applicant should be developed during interview. It is realized

that many fields of employment are now available to above-average

applicants and it should be clearly established at the outset whether or

not an individual is sincerely interested in working for the Bureau or merely

making application to have another iron in the fire. In those instances

where there is doubt due to the youth of the applicant, you should consider

contacting the parents to insure they are agreeable to allowing the applicant

to leave home and work in Washington, D. C. Misconceived ideas and

ill-formed opinions of living conditions in metropolitan Washington should

be refuted. Educational opportunities and attendant costs, as well as

costs of supporting himself until he receives his first salary check, should

be thoroughly discussed. The above are not the only reasons given for

declining appointment; however, these are being set out for your guidance.

The above matters should be brought to the attention of all

personnel processing applicants to insure that problems existing at the

time of interview are resolved during the interview.

The above-revised quotas were given thorough consideration

and will provide an even flow of qualified applicants to meet anticipated

vacancies at Seat of Government. If wholehearted participation is given

to this program by each office, it should not be necessary to double the quota

at any time, barring any unforeseen emergency, thus allowing each office a

higher consistency in assignment of personnel. Since the quotas will not go

into effect until October 1, 1966, you will have ample time to formulate your

recruitment program bearing in mind that appointments may be offered six

months in advance.

Each quota office will be held directly responsible to insure the

success of this program. I want to clearly emphasize that those offices not

designated as quota offices still have the responsibility of procuring

applicants for employment at the Seat of Government. This matter will be

closely supervised at Seat of Government and will be analyzed during the

inspection of each office.

(G) COMMUNIST PARTY, USA -- The 18th National Convention of the

Communist Party, USA, was held in New York City, June 22-26, 1966.

I want to direct your attention to the significance of the Convention as it

relates to our investigations of communist activities.

The very fact that the Convention was held--the first one

since 1959--denotes the feeling of communists that the time has come for

them to resume operations openly and boldly. The pervading mood of

those who attended the Convention was one of optimism based on the

conviction that the political climate is ripe for radicalism.

The effect of the Convention on the Communist Party was

important in several ways. It assured a continuing leadership dedicated

to Soviet interests; it tightened the framework of Party organization; it

established greater unity of purpose in regard to objectives; it gave birth

to a youthful cadre demanding a greater voice in Party affairs and

advocating a more militant role for the Party; and it originated a number

of programs aimed at increasing the Party's membership and influence.

As a result of the programs adopted at the Convention, we

can expect the Communist Party to (1) intensify efforts to infiltrate labor

unions; (2) inject itself openly into civil rights struggles; (3) increase

participation in antiwar demonstrations; (4) expand relationships with

elements of the so-called New Left movement in the United States; and

(5) exploit grievances of campus groups and minority segments to a

greater degree for the purpose of gaining new supporters and increasing

communist influence.

The intensified communist activity that can be expected

represents both a challenge and an opportunity. All offices must be prepared

to insure that the increased activities are adequately covered and reported.

This can best be accomplished by seizing the opportunity to develop new

informants as the Party steps up its recruitment efforts. In this regard, a

significant increase in the number of informants in the Communist Party

should be made within the next year. In addition, greater stress should be

placed on disruptive efforts aimed at the Communist Party through our

Counterintelligence Program.

In short, you must be fully aware of the fact that the

Communist Party is going to move aggressively now on the national scene.

I expect you to counter this move with an imaginative approach and to be

particularly alert to communist efforts to expand influence in political

groups, labor unions, civil rights groups, and on the campuses.

(H) SOVIET DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITIES - INTERNAL SECURITY -

RUSSIA -- Instructions in Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II,

Section Nine, page 12, indicate that five copies of reports should be

submitted to Bureau in classification 105 except in reporting coverage of

travel by Soviet-bloc personnel who engage in activity of interest to one

of the military agencies. These circumstances require submission of

eight copies of reports.

Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section Four, page

35, indicates that in submitting data in nonprosecutable cases in

classifications 65 and 105, number of copies of letterhead memoranda should

be governed by the dissemination required. In most instances, field is not

cognizant of what dissemination will be made of information furnished by

Bureau. Frequently information is contained in communications submitted

by the field which would be of obvious interest to other agencies such as

Atomic Energy Commission, United States Information Agency, and

National Security Agency; therefore, you should thoroughly analyze the

content of communications submitted to insure that sufficient copies are

being made available so that Bureau may fulfill its dissemination respon-

sibilities without effecting reproduction of the communications. If any

doubt exists in this regard, it should be resolved in favor of submitting

extra copies of the communication. Continuing interest by military

organizations and other Government agencies in the activities of

personnel assigned to the Office of the Soviet Military, Naval, and Air

Attaches, indicates necessity to furnish ten copies of communications

submitted concerning the activities of these persons in the future.

Similar interest by other agencies of the Government in activities of

Soviet correspondents and persons assigned to the Press Department of

the Soviet Embassy, makes it necessary to furnish eight copies of

communications concerning these persons in the future.

Rules of Criminal Procedure became effective July 1, 1966. Printed copies

of the Rules are being obtained and will be distributed to all offices. The

Department of Justice is issuing no instructions concerning the new Rules at

For your further information, there are set out below analyses

of the new material appearing in the Rules which appear to be most pertinent

to the work of this Bureau.

RULE 4

WARRANT OR SUMMONS UPON COMPLAINT

(a) Issuance

The probable cause necessary for the issuance of a warrant

formerly had to be shown in the complaint. This amendment provides

that probable cause may be shown in the complaint or in an affidavit to be

filed with the complaint. This change is consistent with the instructions

in SAC Letter 66-41 (A).

RULE 16 DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

The right of the defendant to examine and copy information

and objects in the possession of the government before trial has been

expanded by amended rule 16. The court may order the attorney for the

government to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph

relevant (1) written or recorded statements or confessions made by the

defendant (2) results or reports of physical or mental examinations, and of

scientific tests or experiments made in connection with the particular case

and (3) recorded testimony of the defendant before a grand jury.

The court also may order the attorney for the government to

permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph books, papers,

documents, tangible objects, buildings or places, upon a showing of materiality

to the preparation of his defense and that the request is reasonable. This rule

does not apply to investigative reports, memoranda, other internal government

documents or to statements made by witnesses.

The net effect is to permit the defendant access to government-

held recordings of his own statements, items of physical evidence, and the

results of certain tests and examinations before their introduction at trial.

Where such inspection is ordered, it will be incumbent upon the custodian of

the items to assure that their condition is not altered in any way.

The new rule also provides that upon a sufficient showing the

court may at any time order that the discovery or inspection be denied,

restricted or deferred, or make such other order as is appropriate. The

government may make a sufficient showing in the form of a written statement

to be inspected by the court in camera.

The government also may be granted discovery. If the court

has ordered the government to make available certain objects and information

under this rule, the court may condition its order by requiring that the

defendant permit the government to inspect and copy or photograph scientific

or medical reports, books, papers, documents, tangible objects, or copies

or portions thereof, which the defendant intends to produce at trial and which

are in his possesion, custody or control, upon a showing of materiality to

the preparation of the government's case and that the request is reasonable.

This does not require production of reports, memoranda, or other internal

defense documents. In addition, production is not required of statements

made by the defendant, or statements made by government or defense

witnesses, or by prospective government or defense witnesses to the defendant.

RULE 20

TRANSFER FROM THE DISTRICT FOR PLEA AND SENTENCE

(a) Indictment or Information Pending

The amended rule provides for disposition of the case on a plea

of guilty or nolo contendere in the district in which the defendant was arrested

or in which he is held. A defendant already in custody may, therefore, request

transfer of Federal charges pending against him in another district.

(b) Indictment or Information Not Pending

This new subsection to the rule provides for the defendant arrested

on a warrant issued on a complaint in a district other than the district of arrest

to have his case disposed of in the latter district by entering a plea of guilty

or nolo contendere. The defendant is permitted to waive indictment and to

enter a plea to an information.

(d) Juveniies

A juvenile arrested or held in a district other than the one in which

the offense was committed may consent to be proceeded against as a juvenile

delinquent in the district in which he is arrested or held.

RULE 32

SENTENCE AND JUDGMENT

(c) Presentence Investigation

(2) Report

This subsection as amended provides that the court, before

imposing sentence, may disclose to the defendant or his counsel all or part

record, his characteristics, financial condition, and the circumstances

KNIGHT -- Attached are (1) a copy of the syndicated column by Drew Pearson

which appeared in the August 4, 1966, edition of "The Washington Post and

Times Herald"' and (2) a copy of the letter dated August 5, 1966, which I have -

sent to Mr. Fortune Pope, President of the Bell-McClure Syndicate, protesting

against Pearson's irresponsible reporting. If you receive inquiries regarding

Pearson's column and/or the letter purportedly written to me by Miss Frances

Knight of the State Department, you may use the material in the second

paragraph of my letter of August 5, 1966, in answering them. Furthermore,

you may point out that the "Congressional Record" for April 5, 1966, contains

a letter written by Secretary of State Dean Rusk clearly showing that the State

Department was not asked to conduct an investigation or surveillance of

Harvard Professor H. Stuart Hughes--as Pearson asserts.

D) RIOTS AND DISTURBANCES - No area of the country has escaped

unrest and turbulence based on racial and ethnic considerations. Outbreaks

ranging from minor disturbances to major violence and actual riots

accompanied by looting, arson, and attacks on law enforcement and

constituted authority have occurred in such places as Cleveland, Ohio,

and Chicago, Illinois.

With the hot month of August upon us and Labor Day approaching,

the tenor of the times is heavy with the threat of similar outbreaks in many

parts of the Nation. For the Bureau to carry out its urgent and pressing

responsibilities in the extremely critical racial situation, it is essentiai that

we be completely knowledgeable of the over-all racial situation, trouble

spots, and any indications of outbreaks of violence.

As you were previously informed, I am holding each Special

Agent in Charge personally responsible to see to it that all necessary

arrangements are made to insure that he will be apprised in advance of all

racial developments in his territory which clearly point to the possibility

of mob violence and riotous conditions. To accomplish this: you must

continue to maintain a constant and effective check on existing racial conditions

and developments through your racial, criminal, and security informants and

through your other sources and liaison contacts. You should see to it that you

have the necessary informant and source coverage to stay on top of the situation.

I wish to reiterate the importance of giving your sources and

informants specific assignments to obtain in advance information concerning

racial developments, organizational activity, youth gang behavior or the

activities of other violent elements which may possibly develop into mou violence

or riotous conditions. You are reminded that existing Bureau instructions

require that you maintain close coverage of subversive organizations, hate

groups, and black nationalist groups in order to know of their involvement

in racial matters.

In the event of an actual riot or violent disturbance, direct and

specific information is needed as to what individuals and organizations, if

any, are fanning the flames, inciting to riot, loot, and burn, and whether

these persons or organizations are communist including splinter groups and

the "new left" movement, black nationalist, hate group or youth gang types,

or riotous lawless youths with no group affiliation.

8-9-66

SAC LETTER 66-50

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 186

---

## Page 187

Liaison in depth with police and the intelligent utilization of

informants and sources are essential in providing such intelligence coverage.

Other methods and techniques for obtaining the necessary information, such

as the assignment of Agent personnel of the same ethnic groups as that

involved in the disturbance who can function effectively and safely in the

disturbance area, must be considered. The methods and techniques necessary

will, of course, be dependent upon the nature and extent of the violence or

activity involved and it will be incumbent upon you to take the appropriate

action in this regard. However, photographing and observation of specific

demonstrations by Bureau personnel, where they are identified as such,

should not be conducted without prior Bureau authority. You should bear in

mind that the Bureau has no protective responsibilities with regard to these

situations.

Immediate notification to the Bureau of any outbreaks of

violence is absolutely essential and follow-up communications of pertinent

developments must be submitted on a timely basis in order that the Bureau

will have the details necessary for a complete picture of the situation. It

is imperative that such information should be submitted to the Bureau on a

continuing and timely basis because high-ranking officials of the Executive

Branch of the Government rely heavily on the racial intelligence developed by

the Bureau to keep them abreast of the situation in fulfilling their administrative

responsibilities.

You are also reminded that when rumors or allegations of pending

violence are received you should take logical steps to "run down" each matter

to the original source to determine if there is any substance to it. Such

immediate and positive action can have a deterrent effect on those involved.

You must be certain that any information developed or received

of plans or rumors of impending violence is immediately furnished to

appropriate law enforcement officials on a continuing basis. In the past,

the timely dissemination of such information has been most effective and has

made it possible for law enforcement officials to take direct action against

individuals or groups to prevent or curtail their plans for violence.

Honorable Fortune Popa

President

Bell-VIcClure Syndicate, Inc.

230 West 41st Street

New York, New York 10036

Dear Mr. Pope:

In the interest of fairness and accuracy, I am writing

you relative to the enclosed column by Mir. Drew Pearson entitled

"The Washington Merry-Go-Round, " which appeared in "The

Washington Post and Times Herald"' on August 4, 1966. Whtle Ihave

not written you previously with respect to the many inaccurate and

distorted statements about the FBI made by Mr. Pearson, I do feel

compelled to call to your attention this most recent and flagrant

example of his irresponsible reporting.

In his column of August 1, 1966, Mi. Pearson places

great reliance on a letter dated March 21, 1935, purportedly written

to me by Miss Frances Knight of the Department of State. I have

never received such a letter, and Miss Knight has branded the letter

a complete forgery.

Several members of the Washington press corps have

advised us that copies of the letter upon which Mr. Pearson bases his

August 4th column were sent to them anonymously last week. Unlike

Mr. Pearson, these reporters had both the common sense and the

integrity to check the facts, and they found that the letter was a com-

plete fabrication.

I am certain that it is equally as inconceivable to you,

as it is to me, that any so-called news "authority" would publish

material received from an anonymous source without making an effort

Honorable Fortune Pope

to verify its authenticity. Yety neither Mr. Peazaon nor any merabes

of his stat contacted the FB% regarding the purported letter from

Miss Knight. Nor, I have been advised, was Miss Knight contacted.

In his August 4th coluan, Mr. Fearson accuses the

F'BI of requesting the State Dapartment to concuct a "aurvelllance.'

and to "spy on" Harvard Professor II. Stuart Eughea during a trip

abroad. Records of both the State Department and the FBi, Including

correspondence between Secretary Dean Fusk and me, clearly retlect

that we did not make such a zequest. The fact that erronecus repostion

compounded by ill-advised statements by a Stata Department press

officer. Implying that the FBI made such & request were circulated

last spring doas not relieve Mis. Pearson of his responsibilly to ba

accurate in his facts, because & true account of the matter in readily

available in the public record.

While it is an unfortunate lact that a satraction never

catches up with the original false report, nonetheless I do feel that the

subscribers to your syndicate are entitled to a statement of the truch.

I trust that you are just as intarested as l am in tairess and journallatio

integrity.

Sinceraly yours,

The NOI is an all-Negro organization which was

originally organized in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan. Muhammad

claims to have been selected by Allah, the Supreme Being, to

lead the so-called Negro race out of slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an independent black nation

in the United States. Members following Muhammad's teachings

and his interpretation of the "Koran" believe there is no such

thing as a Negro; that the

so-called Negroes are slaves of the

white race, referred to as "white devils," in the United States;

and that the white race, because of its exploitation of the

so-called Negroes, must and will be destroyed in the approaching

"War of Armageddon."

In the past, officials and members of the NOI,

including huhammad, have refused to register under the provisions

of the Selective Service Acts and have declared that members

owe no allegiance to the United states.

In may s, 195o, the tirst source advised that huhamma

nad, upon advice of legal counsel, tempered his persona.

statements and instructions to his ministers concerning the

principles of his organization in order to avoid possible

prosecution by the united states Government; however, he did not

indicate any fundamental changes in the teachings of

his organi-

• zation.

On May 2, 1966, a third source advised that Muhammad

had, early in July, 1958, decided to de-emphasize the religious

aspects of the teachings of Islam and to stress the economic

benefits to be derived by those 'Negroes who joired the NOI.

This policy change, according to luhammad, would help him

acquire additional followers and create more interest in his

Internal Security Act of 1950, as amended.

A second source advised in May, 1964, that the

full support and approval, and the CP took the position that

the committee's composition must be extremely broad and the

Party's direct influence must be kept to a minimum, The CP

taking this position. Lillian Berman, NCRMA Executive Secretary,

United States. This Manifesto indicated that RAM had oriented

its program to one of education and political revolution and

the organization of a "black" political party with revolutionary

objectives, having recognized the need for a "black revolution"

that could

RAM philosophy is described

in this document as one of revolutionary nationalism, that is,

one involving the struggles of the non-white races of the

world against exploitation and ensiavement by the white

capitalist and imperialist nations.

Regarding Williams, above, it should be noted that

is dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalist system in

the United States, by violence ifrecessary, and to its

replacement by a socialistic system oriented toward the

Chinese Communist interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.

"UE - the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of

America" was established in 1936 at a convention in Buffalo,

New York.

At that time the organization was called the

United Electrical and Radio Workers of America. Shortly

a large group of American Federation of Labor

machenists, locals joined the UE and the full name became

the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America

(UE) .

The UE is known as an "International Union" because

companies of both the United States and Canada are under

contract.

"100 Things You Should Know About Communism and

Labor," prepared and released by the Committee on Un-American

Activities, United States House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.,

1951, relates the following information: "In 1944, the

Committee on Un-American Activities found the 'United Electrical,

Radio and Machine Workers of America (CIO)' to be one of the

unions which was described as having 'communist leadership

...strongly entrenched.'

The 'United' Electrical, Radio and

Machine Workers of America' was listed as one of

the unions

which was expelled from the Congress of Industrial

Organizations in 1950 because of its communist domination."

The "Internal Security Annual Report for 1957,

Report of the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration

of the Internal Security Act and other Internal Security

Laws,

of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,"

on page 61, refers to UE as "one of the strongest communist

purpose of setting in motion forces for the establishment

of a new national Marxist-oriented youth organization which

would hunt for the most peaceful transition to socialism.

The delegates were told that it would be reasonable to

assume that the young socialists attracted into this new

organization would eventually pass into the CP itself.

A second

source has advised that the founding

convention for the new youth organization was held from

June 19-21, 1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco,

California, at which time the name W.L.B. DuBois Clubs ot

America (DCA) was

adopted.

Approximately 500 delegates from

throughout the United States attended this convention.

The

as set forth in the preamble to

aims of this organizationit is our belief that this nation

its constitution, are:

can best solve its problems in an atmosphere of peaceful

coexistence, complete disarmament and true freedom for all

peoples of

the world, and that these solutions will be

reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic

elements in our country, composed essentially of the working

people allied in the unity of Negroes and other minorities

with whites.

We further fully recognize that the greatest

threat to American democracy comes from the racist and right

wing forces in coalition with the most reactionary sections

of the economic power structure, using the tool of

anticommunism to divide and destroy the unified struggle of

the working people."

Over the labor Day weekend, 1965, the DCA held a

conference in Chicago,

Illinois, and

a new slate of officers

was elected to the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the

DCA.

Since Labor Day, 1965, identities of those serving on

the

NEC has varied; however, according to a third source as

of May, 1966, thirteen of the fifteen members of the NEC

were members

of the CP in the San Francisco Bay area.

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on February 12,

1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SW) minority group under the

leadership of National Committee member, Sam Ballan, split from

the SHe.

The source stated that this minority group, referred

to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and

policy

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpretation

of political events, split from the SVP on the grounds that the

Party was liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist

precepts of Leon Trotsky and retreating from the right for

the world socialist revolution.

The final issue which ultimately

forced the split was the minority's opposition to the SIP

regroupment policy which involved cooperation with the

Communist Party (CP) periphery - individuals characterized

by the minority as petty-bourgeois.

The above issue, page 6, set forth the founding

declaration of YSA.

This declaration stated that the YSA

recognizes the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only

existing political leadership on class struggle principles,

and that the

supporters of theis have come into basic political

solidarity with the SiP on the principles oi revolutionary

socialism.

A source advised on May 23, 1966, that the original

On December 10, 1966, Senator Robert F. Kennedy released

to the press a copy of a letter to him dated February 17, 1966, from

former Assistant Director Courtney A Evans. In direct contradiction

to official memorada prepared by Evans for Bureau files during the

Evans 'did not discuss the use of "microphones by the FBI with Kennedy

during his tenure as Attorney General--nor did Evans "'know of any

written material that was sent to you" (Kennedy) "at any time concerning"

microphone surveillances.

In view of; Evans' obvious lack of integrity, disregard for

OF THE DEPARTMENT

DATE:

July 7, 1961

In line with the Director's approval, the Attorney General was

contacted this morning, July 7, 1961, relative to his observation as to the

possibility of utilizing "electronic devices" in organized crime investigations.

It was pointed out to the Attorney General that we had taken action

with regard to the use of microphone surveillances in these cases and while

they represented an expensive investigative step, we were nevertheless utilizing

them in all instances where this was technically feasible and where valuable

information might be expected. The strong objections to the utilization of

telephone taps as contrasted to microphone surveillances was stressed. The

Attorney General stated he recognized the reasons why telephone taps should

be restricted to national defense-type cases and he was pleased we had been

using microphone surveillances where these objections do not apply wherever

possible in organized crime matters.

The Attorney General noted that he had approved several technical

surveillances in connection with security-type investigations since he took

office, but that he had not kept any record and didn't really know what he had

approved and what surveillances were currently in operation. He said that for

his own information he would like to see a list of the technical surveillances

now in operation. He added that this could be brought over to him personally

and that he would look it over and immediately return it because he realized

the importance of having these records maintained under the special security

conditions which only the FBI had.

If the Director approves, we will have the list of technical

surveillances prepared, delivered personally to the Attorney General and

then returned to the Bureau's file.

WASHINGTON 25. D. C.

August 17, 1961

In connection with the use of microphone

surveillances it is frequently necessary to lease a special telephone

line in order to monitor such a surveillance. These situations

occur when it is impossible to locate a secure monitoring point

in the immediate vicinity of the premises covered by the microphone.

Even though a special telephone line is utilized, this activity in

no way involves any interception of telephonic communications and

is not a telephone tap.

In the New York City area the telephone company

has over the years insisted that a letter be furnished to the telephone

company on each occasion when a special telephone line is leased by

the FBI. It is required that such a lease arrangement be with the

approval of the Attorney General. In the past we have restricted

the utilization of leased lines in New York City to situations involving

telephone taps, all of which have been approved by the Attorney General.

We have not previously used leased lines in connection

with microphone surveillances because of certain technical difficulties

which existed in New York City, These technical duriculties have,

however, now been overcome.

I we are permitted to use leased telephone

lines as an adjunct to our microphone surveillances, this type of coverage

can be materially extended both in security and major criminal cases.

Accordingly, your approval of our utilizing this leased line arrangement

is requested. A sample of the letter which it is proposed will be sent

to the telephone company if a leased line is secured in connection with

microphone surveillances is attached.

Approved:

(A) FEDERAL INCOME TAX - ADDITIONAL WITHHOLDING EXEMPTIONS --

Beginning in 1967, employees may be entitled to claim additional Federal

income tax exemptions if they have itemized deductions for 1966 and if they

expect to have itemized deductions for 1967. Claiming such additional

exemptions will have the effect of reducing the amount of income tax withheld

(from biweekly payments. To be eligible for such additional exemptions, an

employee must have filed his 1966 Federal Tax Return. To claim such

¡exemptions, an employee must submit a new W-4 Form as well as Schedule A

to this form. In completing these forms it is essential that the exemptions

claimed in Item 5 of the W-4 Form be in agreement with Item 7 of Schedule A.

Any W-4 Form submitted, bearing entries in Item 5, must be accompaniea oy

Schedule A. If an employee desires to have extra income tax withheld from his

'salary, he need only to enter the extra amount that he desires to be withheld each

pay period opposite Item 7 of the W-4 Form. Such amounts must be shown in

dollars only (no cents).

Exemptions claimed because of itemized deductions for 1967 will

remain in effect through April 30, 1968. To continue the withholding of such

exemptions beyond that date, a new W-4 Form and Schedule A must be submitted

based on the income tax return data for 1967. If no new forms are submitted,

Federal income tax deductions after April 30, 1968, will be based on exemptions

claimed on the existing W-4 Form except for those shown opposite Item 5. The

same general rule will apply in future years. Exemptions may be changed or

discontinued at any time by executing a W-4 Form, with Schedule A where

applicable.

The new W-4 Form, as well as Schedule A, has been ordered and

as soon as these forms are received a supply will be forwarded to your oifice.

When received, your current supply of W-4 Forms should be destroyed and the

new forms used exclusively thereafter. If additional forms are needed they

should be requisitioned in the usual manner from the Bureau.

(B) IMMIGRANTS FROM USSR AND SATELLITE COUNTRIES -- Bureau letter

to all offices August 2, 1966, expanded investigations of Soviet-bloc immigrants

for a trial period of six months based on our experience in a case of two Soviet i

illegal agents who entered the United States through Canada as immigrants

claiming East German birth.

The following case, which has recently come to the attention of

the Bureau, is being called to your attention in connection with investigations

under Section 105E, Vanual of Instructions, since it demonstrates the Soviet

Intelligence Service is recruiting immigrants to the United States.

Upon the

recommendation of a source on Estonian matters, a Russian immigrant of

Estonian descent was interviewed in 1964 to determine whether he might have

information of interest due to the fact he had recently arrived in the United

States from the Soviet Union. He did supply general information concerning

conditions in Estonia under Soviet domination.

On July 11, 1966, the immigrant directed a letter to the Bureau

requesting that he be contacted "to discuss some political problems." When

contacted, he supplied additional information concerning his background and

his efforts to rejoin his wife and two sons from whom he had become separated

tring World War II and who had been living in the United States.

He stated that after unsuccessful attempts to leave the Soviet

Union he had been interviewed by the "Security Police" and was told that the

only way he could go to the United States would be to agree to furnish information

to the Soviets and that after he had been in the United States for two and one-

half years the Soviets would get in touch with him. He agreed to do this and

was instructed in the use of contact paper for secret writing and the use of

microdots. Following his entry into the United States in 1963, the Soviets

made no contact with him until June, 1966, when he received a letter from

an acquaintance in Estonia indicating the Soviets were initiating contact with

• him.

No investigation of this Russian immigrant had been conducted

under Section 105E, Manual of Instructions. Inquiry disclosed the field office

covering the immigrant's original destination in the United States had no

record of notification from the Immigration and Naturalization Service con-

cerning the immigrant's arrival.

Each Special Agent in Charge is instructed to reexamine the

handling of cases under Section 1052, Manual of Instructions, to assure that

liaison with the Immigration and Naturalization Service is providing notifi-

cation of the arrival of all immigrants from the countries listed in that

Section; that screening procedures and investigations are thorough; and

that all Agents handling security investigations are alert to recognize

immigrants who might have been recruited as intelligence Agents and who

have not been investigated.

Due to his age (52) and family status, the above immigrant might

have been eliminated under the criteria in Section 105E, Manual öf Instructions.

Therefore, these criteria must be broadened with regard to immigrants from

the Soviet Union. Manual changes regarding this will be forthcoming.

Attention is also called to the possibility that persons in the

Latvian, Lithuanian, or Estonian ethnic groups who may have been recruited

by the Soviet Intelligence Service may be more willing to reveal their recruit-

ment than persons of Russian descent.

Above Bureau letter of August 2, 1966, advised immigrants

could enter the United States without a sponsor if they had assured employment

in this country. For your information, immigrants may also enter without

sponsors if they can show they will not become public charges because of

financial resources in their own possession. The granting of visas is within

the discretion of United States Consular officials and the Immigration and

Naturalization Service records may not show the specific basis upon which

immigrants are admitted without a sponsor.

## Page 230

During fiscal year 1966, FBI personnel drove more than 42, 600, 000

miles in fulfilling our responsibilities.

Due to the fact our work requires

extensive use of automotive vehicles with resuiting exposure to possibility

of accidents, it is imperative that continuing priority attention be given to

accident prevention and the encouragement of safe driving. As driving

conditions differ in the various parts of the country, it is necessary that

safety programs be designed to obtain best possible results in each geograph-

ical area. The success of these programs will depend upon the personal

interest and direction of the SAC from whom these programs must emanate.

Careful indoctrination is being afforded new agents during their attendance

at New Agents' Classes, which should be continued as they report in the field.

Automobile accidents not only cause loss of use of vehicles for

varied periods, increased operating costs, and additional administrative

work, but more important, possible injury or death to employee. Reduction

of accidents should be a challenge which all supervisors and officials should

accept.

The only acceptable goal for any office is the elimination of all

accidents and I am pleased to note that four offices and Quantico had no

accidents in fiscal year 1966. In addition, 19 other offices had no accidents

chargeable to employees. These offices are being awarded safe driving

certificates for prominent display in suitable locations in these offices. I

regret to advise increases in accidents were reported in 25 offices. It is

essential that each SAC take whatever aggressive action is necessary in his

office to achieve the goal of an accident-free record in the current fiscal

year. The performance of your office in this regard will reveal the

effectiveness of your efforts.

You should bring the foregoing information to the attention of all

authorized drivers of the Bureau's automotive equipment. Continued close

supervision must be afforded automobile accident investigations and personnel

are to be forcefully reminded of their accountability for damages to Govern-

ment property resulting from accidents in which they are responsible.

(B) FBI FACIAL IDENTIFICÁTION CATALOG - FBI FORM BOOK -- The

Exhibits Section of the Administrative Division has prepared an FBI Facial

Identification Catalog to be used by our Agents to assist in the interviewing

of witnesses in Bureau cases where an artist's conception of an unknown

subject is desired.

Copies of this Catalog along with a supply of the FBI Facial Identi-

fication Fact Sheet (FD-383) are being transmitted separately to each office.

Upon receipt, these Catalogs should be added to the nonexpendable inventory

of each office. There are attached to this SAC Letter three copies of FD-383;

one copy should be placed in the FBI Form Book.

The Catalogs should be afforded appropriate security but SAC's

should feel free to distribute them to appropriate squads and resident

agencies to permit ready access by Agent personnel. The FD-383 contains

instructions concerning its use and page 4 of the Catalog gives detailed

instructions. Agents should be thoroughly familiar with these instructions

prior to using the Catalog.

An artist's conception should be requested only when the inter-

viewing Agent feels that the witness recalls sufficient data concerning the

facial characteristics of the unknown subject to warrant such a request.

Artist's conceptions will be prepared in black and white. Color sketches are

very time consuming to prepare and generally add nothing from an investi-

gative aid standpoint over a black and white print. They will be considered

only after the witness advises a black and white sketch is a good likeness

and their preparation is completely justified by the requesting office.

Agents assigned to unsolved bank robbery and other major cases

should consider requesting the preparation of an artist's conception

whenever they feel the witness or witnesses are in a position to furnish

sufficient descriptive details of facial characteristics and when other

immediate leads have been exhausted. The Bureau's Exhibits Section has

a limited staff of artists available to prepare these artist's conceptions.

By the proper use of this Catalog, our artist's conceptions can be made

more effective but at the same time it should be borne in mind that

indiscriminate requests for artist's conceptions will only dilute the

effectiveness of this program.

(C) COMMUNICATIONS ECONOMY - TELETYPE SERVICE - SAC

Letter 66-54 (C), 8/30/66, advised you of increase in TWX teletype

message tolls effective 9/1/66, and of measures you should take to keep

teletype costs as low as possible. For your information, the average

Bureau single-address TWX teletype transmission is two and one-half

minutes, and for conference messages it is a minute longer. The longer

transmission time of conference messages is substantially because of

the increase in time to obtain an acknowledgment from each addressee

• office. This is another goou reason for sending messages individually

rather than as a conference transmission. At speed Bureau's teletype-

writers operate, a teletype message heading and approximately five

lines of text can be transmitted in one minute and approximately seven

lines of text for each additional full minute of transmission time. To.

transmission time must be added the time required for the acknowledgment.

Consider these facts in approving teletypes for transmission.

Assure your employees send multiple address messages to each addressee

individually rather than as conference messages in each instance it can

be done and that they acknowledge for messages immediately. Field

teletype bills for September, 1966, and subsequent bills for any office not

following instructions, will be examined at SOG to assure Bureau's desires

in this matter are followed.

(F) INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN PROPERTY -

prosecution under the subsection of Section 2314, Title 18, United States

Code, concerned with the interstate transportation of tools and implements

used in falsely making or counterfeiting securities, including cases where

check writers were considered as the tool or implement used. Some

United States Attorneys have, however, questioned whether a check writer

is a tool or implement within the meaning of the statute, and in at least

one instance the Department upheld declination of prosecution.

The Department has now directed our attention to the decision

by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the matter involving Elledge vs.

United States (359 F 2d 404 (C.A. 9, 1966)). This decision upheld the

indictment and affirmed the conviction in a case involving a check writer.

The court held in this instance that it is the fraudulent purpose of the

transportation rather than the criminal character of the thing transporied

which constitutes the offense.

(G) SECURITY INFORMANTS -- Current restrictions on the use of confidential

investigative techniques have made the gathering of intelligence data and the

protection of the country against subversives far more difficult than in the past.

• Furthermore, there have been expanded communist activities in general and

widespread demonstrations throughout the country involving subversive eiements.

Although we have made appreciable progress in our coverage of subversive

activities, it being noted that 16 security informants were placed in the

Communist Party during the first six months of this year against 15 during

the 12 months of 1965, additional informants are needed if we are to have

necessary coverage of subversive activities.

The importance of security informants to the Bureau and in turn to

the security of the United States demands that we continue to exercise every

effort and means to develop and maintain adequate informant coverage of the

Communist Party and other subversive organizations. There is still a great

need for additional security informant coverage in all phases of our investigative

activity in the internal security field. This matter should be stressed to all

personnel assigned to security investigations.

of the problems we face in the field of Soviet intelligence and discusses the

techniques and targets of Soviet agents. The article also sets forth suggestions

on how citizens, as well as industrial security officers, can be of assistance

to the FBI in this area.

This article should be considered as a possible investigative aid in

WASHINGION, D.C. 20535

October 11, 1966

RE:

DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION BY TELETYPE

1:

During the Dominican crisis, the unusual demands

of the situation required the Bureau to install a teletype

system whereby teletype dissemination could be made of current

intelligence data to the White House and other interested

agencies within the hour of its receipt at the Bureau from

Santo Domingo and other contributing offices. The White House,

Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense

Intelligence Agency, Department of the Army, Department of the

Air Force,

Secret Service, and

National Security Agency are on

the Bureau's teletype circuit.

As a result of the success and effectiveness of our

special teletype dissemination procedures in handling Dominican

traffic during the past year, the Bureau is now extending

these procedures to all current intelligence data concerning

security-type, racial

(exclusive of civil rights), threats

against the President, and foreign intelligence matters which,

because of importance

and urgency, are furnished to the Bureau

by teletype and which warrant inmediate dissemination to one

or more agencies on the teletype circuit.

By extending these special dissemination procedures,

the Bureau will not only be able to iurnish to other agencies

written dissemination of current intelligence electronically

with maxinum security in code provided, but the savings in

cost and manpower by eliminating duplicate reporting now

required by follow-up airtels and letterhead menoranda could

be considerable.

The

success, however, of this system will

depend on your ability to recognize the data which meet the

criteria for teletype dissemination and to prepare the field

teletype in a manner whereby such can be retransmitted with

an absolute minimum of editing at the Bureau.

i

NW 55041

DocId: 32989525

## Page 239

Immediately after appropriate caption, teletype

should be worded in the same manner as a well-prepared, concise

letterhead memorandum.

Use of abbreviations (except in the

administrative section) is restricted to those which are

universally accepted (such as Mr., Hrs., Dr..) and to well-

known abbreviations for a name or subject matter when it has

been set out in

full the first time it appears in the text.

When it is necessary to describe individuals and

organizations in the teletype, you must endeavor to utilize

succinct descriptions and in doing so be absolutely certain

that any such description is substantiated by back-up material

in your files.

With reference to submissions relating to threats

against the President, the body of the teletype prepared for

dissemination should contain names of organizations advised

locally, Identities of employees to whom information was

furnished, date and time of notification and identity of FBI

employee furnishing information.

under this system, set forth all acministrative data, including

references, at the end of the teletype under the heading

"Administrative." If the material is classified, give the

classification assigned and succinct reason for classification

327222

under this heading.

For your possible assistance, there is attached a

sample copy of a teletype submitted by the field in line with

the above.

In deciding whether information being submitted by

teletype meets the test for preparation in form whereby teletype

dissemination by the Bureau can be accomplished, the following

guidelines are suggested:

(1) Current intelligence information is of such

urgency that it is readily apparent the Bureau, to fulfill

Its responsibilities, must mase immediate dissemination on

receipt, and

(2) Dissemination being made would be to one or

more agencies on the Bureau's teletype network. Bear in mind

that the Department of Justice is not on the teletype network

and that if the Department of justice is the sole interested

10/11/66

## Page 240

agency, this teletype dissemination method cannot be used.

On the

other hand, the Bureau is able to make rapid written

dissemination to agencies not on the network by forwarding

by special messenger a Xerox copy of the teletype which has

been disseminated to agencies on the network.

Since teletypes prepared under this system are used

to provide written dissemination, subsequent submission of

letterhead memoranda by cover airtel solely to be used for

written confirmation purposes can be eliminated in many cases.

Accordingly, the administrative section of the field teletype

should state, "No LHM being submitted," when such is the case.

Likewise, preparation of letterhead memoranda solely

for the purpose of

making written dissemination to local

agencies can be eliminated under this system by requesting

the Bureau to furnish a copy of the teletype disseminated at

the Seat of Government. The Bureau will forward such copy

immediately to the originating field office by teletype (where

leased-line teletype facilities exist) and in other instances

expeditiously by sending a Xerox copy of such teletype by mail.

The field office can

then duplicate appropriate number of

copies of the disseminated message which can be used in making

local dissemination or confirming oral dissemination previously

made.

requesting Bureau to forward copy of disseminated

teletype, utilize code word, "SUCOP" (abbreviation for "submit

copy"),

in the administrative section of the teletype message.

When using "SUCOP," there will be no necessity for stating "No

LHM being submitted" as such will be understood.

Where circumstances warrant immediate local

dissemination, such information should be promptly disseminated

orally, not waiting for a Xerox copy from the Bureau.

The Xerox

copy should be utilized for written confirmation upon receipt.

Where the teletype synopsizes lengthy data, the

complete data must be prepared for the record in your files.

Where the more complete data would be essential to proper

10/11/66

SAC LETTER 66-63

NW 55041 DocId:32989525 Page 240

## Page 241

consideration by the Bureau and interested agencies, but is

not necessary to satisfy the need for immediate dissemination,

the teletype should be followed by a detailed letterhead

memorandum or report containing the complete data and the

administrative portion of the teletype should indicate a

letterhead memorandum or report follows.

In extending these special dissemination procedures,

the Bureau is definitely not encouraging the submission of

teletypes where airtels and letters should be used. In fact,

there should be no appreciable increase of teletype messages

involved as data which meet the criteria for this dissemination

system should always have been received at the Bureau previously

in teletype form because of urgency of information involved.

It is, however, the Bureau's intention to provide a readily

available system whereby intelligence data of urgent nature

are expeditiously disseminated in written form under maximum

security conditions to other agencies and the value of

this information is not diluted because of delay occasioned

by the use of outmoded dissemination procedures.

(A) REPORT WRITING - MAPS -- As the result of a suggestion the following

technique is being brought to your attention to be considered for use in reports

wherein it is necessary to describe or pinpoint a particular locality. Briely

the technique consists in mechanical reproduction of the pertinent portion of an

official state road map for inclusion in the first part of a bank robbery, bank

burglary, or other major case report. The item should be inserted in the

first report submitted suitably captioned and depicting the location and

description of the establishment or location where the crime was committed.

Pertinent points of interest or importance should be circled and numbered or

lettered. These markings should be explained on the same page if sufficient

space exists. The marking should be done aiter reproduction and ink or lead

other than black or blue black should be used as these colors tend to obliterate

the existing printed items on the map. Official state road maps should be

used to avoid infringement of copyrights.

This method is used most effectively to determine locales in

sparsely populated, rural or remote areas with less than the usual distinguish- •

ing features or points of reference; however, it will be of value in any type

of case where knowledge of the locale is of benefit to the reader of the report.

Where the technique is applicable, it is plain that it will save considerable

time which would be needed to sketch or verbally describe a particular location.

Holiday Inns located in each of the 50 states and in some parts of Canada

with their general office in Memphis, Tennessee, which may be beneficial

in locating Bureau fugitives and in other cases.

Each night a lengthy

business summary teletype is sent to all Holiday Inns. On a limited basis,:

• Holiday Inns officials have agreed to include with each summary not more

than two short messages concerning Bureau cases. Instances in which

facilities used must be highly sclective, limited to those wherein subjects

patronize, issue worthless checks or steal property from motels. Can-

cellation should be made in the same manner.

Address requests to Bureau

and Memphis on UACB basis. In instances where utilized, all offices

and Legat, Ottawa, must be furnished sufficient background to handle

• potential leads.

(D) CUBAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES -

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA -- There is being prepared at the Bureau

an album relating to Cuban intelligence personalities. This album will

contain background data, photographs, and descriptions of individuals

known to have or suspected of having intelligence assignments on behalf

of Cuba. While investigations of this type for the most part are handled

by San Juan, New York and Miami, other offices and/or Legal Attaches

may in the future acquire data or become involved in investigations

which would identify individuals who could be included in the album.

All offices should be alert for such information and the Bureau should

be advised under the above caption (Bufile 105-80787) in cases Where

data which can logically be included in the album is developed. A copy

of the above album will be furnished to New York, Miami, Newark, San

Juan and Legal Attaches, Mexico City and Ottawa, separately. Any

office desiring a copy of the album for use as an investigative aid

should direct an appropriate communication to the Bureau.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(B) REALIGNMENT OF JUDICIAL DISTRICTS OF CALIFORNIA -- Ef-

fective September 18, 1966, California was divided into the Northern,

Eastern, Central and Southern Judicial Districts. Prior to that date

the Northern and Southern Districts covered the entire state. Criminal

trials pending on the effective date were continued under the same

indictments and in the same courts. For example, assume that an

indictment was returned in the old Northern District and the trial began

in that District prior to September 18, 1966. If the trial was still in

progress on that date the realignment of Judicial Districts did not affect

it, even though the place in which the indictment was returned and the

location of the trial are in a different district under the realignment.

The trial continued as though the place of indictment and the place of

trial were still in the Northern District.

Cases in which the offense was committed prior to September

18, 1966, but trial had not begun by that date also are to be proceeded

with as though there was no realignment of the California Judicial

Districts. Such cases shall be captioned, presented for indictment

and tried in the respective district as it existed prior to September 18,

1966.

The Department of Justice has requested the United States

Attorneys of California to discuss this matter with Federal law enforce-

ment officials in their respective districts. The results of any such

discussions should be appropriately reported to the Bureau for the

attention of the Training Division.

(C) MAJOR CASES - DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION -- At the

present time, in connection with Bank Robbery Statute violations and

major cases involving classifications such as Interstate Transportation

of Stolen Property ard Theit From Interstate Shipment, the office of

origin sends communications to appropriate Bureau field offices, setting

forth the background of the case and requesting that law enforcement

agencies and logical informants be contacted for any pertinent information.

The suggestion has been made that in instances of this kind, the office of

origin incorporate the facts in blind memorandum form and furnish

appropriate offices this memorandum by cover airtel or letter. Receiving

offices having Xerox copying machines can then make a Xerox master

. of the blind memorandum, after which the necessary number of copies

can be reproduced on Multilith equipment. This procedure will

eliminate receiving offices' having to type a master copy from the

incoming communication, and considerable savings of typing time will

be realized.

Effective immediately, all offices requesting other field

divisions to contact confidential informants, law enforcement agencies,

etc., will set out pertinent background information and specific requests

in blind memorandum form, submitting these memoranda to receiving

offices by appropriate cover communication. Receiving offices who

now have Xerox copying machines may then reproduce the necessary

number of copies as outlined above.

(D) TELEPHONES - COMMUNICATIONS ECONOMY - INWARD WIDE

AREA TELEPHONE SERVICE (INWATS) -- Intrastate INWATS, which

permits callers in any area of the state to make telephone calls without

tolls to one specific location in the state, is now available in states

where there are FBI Field Offices as set out in attachment to this

letter. Availability in additional field office states will follow at

discretion of public utility authorities in the states in the next several

months and offices concerned will be advised by routing slip as this

information becomes available to the Bureau. If this information be-

comes available to a field office first, the Bureau should be advised.

Each office now having regular (outward) Wide Area Telephone

Service (WATS) and where INWATS is now available should examine

for the latest available 90-day billing period intrastate toll calls now

being made at Bureau expense and its WATS calls to determine if INWATS

may offer better service, or equivalent service at less cost. Consider

calling pattern and use of one measured time WATS and one full time

INWATS, or vice versa, or other combinations of these services offering

the most in service and economy in your operations. Offices which

have not been able to justify use of full time WATS are not likely to be

able to justify a combination of the two services.

In other offices where INWATS is available examine costs

and calling patterns for intrastate telephone toll calls exchanged with

Resident Agents and with outside agencies and individuals at Bureau

expense for the latest available 90-day billing period to determine

possible value of INWATS. Solicit cooperation of local telephone company

for information as to accumulative monthly circuit time of such toll

calls as pertinent to the study.

No change in current WATS service or use of new WATS or

INWATS may be made without Bureau approval. Offices where INWATS

is now available should furnish Bureau results of analysis of INWATS

value and recommendations for or against its use by December 16, 1966.

Offices where INW.ATS not now available should submit results of INWATS

study and recommendations for or against its use within 30 days of time

notified INWATS available in its headquarters city state.

(E) PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS OF ARTIST'S CONCEPTIONS -- Beginning

November 7, 1966, all artist's conception drawings prepared or revised by

Exhibits Section, Administrative Division (with exception of NABRA items),

will bear on the bottom of each copy, the Bureau file number, the pertinent

field office file number, and the date of issue of the drawing. Thus, the

drawing can be immediately identified with the case to which it pertains.

the office which requested the drawing, and the date of issue.

It will be incumbent upon all offices to remove this information

from copies of such drawings when they are used in circular letters or

released for reproduction by news media. This can be done by cutting

off the bottom portion of the photographic print which contains the file

numbers and date.

Note, however, that this information should not be removed

when these drawings are to be produced as evidence in a court trial, since

date of preparation could be relevant to a Government witness's testimony

and, if cut off, defense counsel could raise question regarding entirety

of evidence.

•STATES ATTORNEYS - Reference is made to SAC Letter 64-48 (B)

dated 9/29/64, and FBI Handbook for Special Agents, Part I, Page

16a.

I want to reiterate existing instructions that whenever Federal

prosecution is declined by a United States Attorney or his assistant

in favor of prosecution by local authorities, and investigation has been

conducted by Bureau personnel, the Bureau should be notified immedi-

ately by airtel or more expeditious means depending on the circum-

stances involved. This communication should contain a concise summary

of the violation, the extent of the investigation conducted by your office

and the specific reason why the United States Attorney feels the matter

should be handled in local court. Your recommendation should be sub-

mitted as to whether this matter should be taken up with Departmental

officials at the headquarters level.

In addition to the above, you should also advise the Bureau

of situations involving juveniles where the U. S. Attorney defers

prosecution and aggravated or other circumstances are present which

• would appear to warrant or justify Federal prosecution.

In order to protect the Bureau's interests, it is essential

there be strict compliance with this rule. Insure this matter is fre-

quently brought to the attention of all investigative personnel.

(G) TECHNICAL AND MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCES - USE OF

INFORMATION FROM ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN CRIMINAL PROSE-

• CUTIONS -- The Acting Attorney General by memorandum 4y3 dated

November 3, 1966, has transmitted to all United States Attorneys

instructions to be alert as to each prosecutive case for evidence that

might be tainted because of the use of electronic devices during the

investigation. The instructions require that in the event the United

States Attorney believes that there has been wire tapping or other

electronic surveillance touching a particular case, he is required to

11/15/66

:

immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General,

Internal Security Division.

With reference to this subject matter the Bureau is currently

handling numerous requests from the Department to check the names of

various subjects against the special indices set up at the Bureau on all

persons who have been subject of any FBI electronic surveillance. It

is expected that any cases questioned by the United States Attorneys

and referred to Mr. Yeagley will be given the same examination on the

request of the Department.

Although instructions to the United States Attorneys by the

Acting Attorney General do not specifically require contact with the

various investigative agencies at the field level, it is quite likely that

some of our field offices will receive inquiries from the United States

Attorneys. In case such inquiries are received by field offices requesting

that information obtained from electronic surveillances be furnished, the

Bureau should be immediately advised of the request and all pertinent

details. No response should be made to the United States Attorneys in

such instances without prior Bureau authorization. This procedure is

necessary in view of the possibility that the subject of a case may have

been in some way covered by an electronic surveillance in a field office

not participating in investigation of the prosecutive case in question.

The instructions issued to the United States Attorneys by the

Acting Attorney General are as follows:

ri/ "You will recall that in May 1966 the Department advised the

Supreme Court of facts relating to the case of Black v. United States,

October Term, 1965, No. 1029. Its memorandum in that case stated

in pertinent part:

'Notwithstanding the Department of Justice's conclusion

that the monitoring of conversations between petitioner and

his attorney had no effect upon his conviction or the fairness

of his trial, we have no doubt that in the circumstances

outlined above petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination.

We also recognize that petitioner has standing to raise, in a

district court, the question whether other conversations (1.e.,

conversations not involving an attorney-client relationship)

which were overheard as a result of the listening device

installed in his suite furnished any leads or evidence

in his case. At an appropriate hearing, the government

proposes to submit all of the facts upon which a full

judicial determination can be made. '

"This Department must never proceed with any investigation or

case which includes evidence illegally obtained or the fruits of that

evidence. No investigation or case of that character shall go forward

until such evidence and all of its fruits have been purged and we are in

a position to assure ourselves and the court that there is no taint or

unfairness. We must, also, scrupulously avoid any situation in which

an intrusion into a confidential relationship would deny a fair hearing

to a defendant or person under investigation.

"For this reason we are in the process of requesting each

investigative agency concerned to review its files in order to determine

whether there has been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching

a particular case or matter. We are making a similar review of cases

and matters pending in the Department. You will be informed im-

mediately whenever a case or matter in your office is found to fall

in this category.

"Many matters are referred directly to your offices by the

investigating agencies. Special attention must be given to these. But,

it is imperative that you and your assistants make every effort to

ascertain whether any cases, now pending or hereafter received, present

the problem of wiretapping or electronic surveillance. No single means

of checking is infallible but you should keep in mind that the same

person or matter may have been investigated by several Federal or

State agencies and the information supplied to you may in fact come

from more than one source. You should be particularly attentive

to those cases which involve, directly or indirectly, hard core elements

of organized crime.

"It is, of course, the very rare case--one out of thousands--

in which you will encounter the problem to which this memorandum is

addressed. The problem will arise in cases in which some investigation

was conducted prior to July, 1965. Present practice, adopted in July

1965 in confirmity with the policies declared by President Johnson on

June 30, 1965.for the entire Federal establishment, prohibits the

• installation of listening devices in private areas (as well as the

interception of telephone and other wire communications) in all

instances other than those involving the collection of intelligence

affecting the national security. The specific authorization of the

Attorney General must be obtained in each instance when this

exception is invoked. Intelligence data so collected will not be

available for investigative or litigative purposes.

"If you have any reason whatever to believe that there has

been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching a particular case,

you should immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant

Attorney General, Internal Security Division, so that further inquiry

may be pursued by the Department."

(H) THEFT FROM INTERSTATE SHIPMENT (TFIS) MATTERS --

An increase in the volume of valuable merchandise being forwarded

in interstate and foreign commerce can be expected with the approach of the

holiday season. Wemustbe prepared to cope with the corresponding

increase in the number of thefts or hijacking of such shipments.

With this in mind each office should prepare to effectively

meet the expected increase in thefts. Informants and sources should

be alerted and coverage in these cases should be increased. Insure

that you have strong, effective liaison with shippers, common carriers,

local law enforcement agencies, and others so that prompt referral

of matters within our jurisdiction will be had.

All thefts must receive immediate and thorough investigative

attention.

for examination purposes.

In order to hold shipping costs to a minimum and insure uniform

(C) HOODLUM COVERAGE IN THE GREATER MIAMI, FLORIDA, AREA

. DURING WINTER SEASON 1966 - 1967 - CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM --

During the winter season it is necessary for the Miami Office to make special

plans to afford coverage of the activities of out-of-town hoodlums who visit the

area. These plans include the utilization of informants and sources in places

frequented by racketeers and the dissemination of appropriate information to

responsible local officials and authorities.

To assist the Miami Office in the prompt establishment of effective

• soverage on hoodlums and racketeers traveling to the Miami area, field offices

are instructed to furnish to the Miami Office background information, including

criminal records and physical descriptions, as well as details of itineraries

of such hoodlums. Information on travel plans should be forwarded expeditiously

by appropriate communication to provide as much notice as possible to the

Miami Office. Make certain that information received from confidential

informants and valuable sources is not jeopardized by investigative activity

or dissemination to other agencies, but is appropriately paraphrased where

necessary. All surveillances instituted must be discreet and should only be

conducted where there is a definite and useful objective to be achieved.

All offices should furnish a brief outline to Miami of public source

data identifying any of these hoodlums as members of organized criminal

groups, such as La Cosa Nostra, which information can be made available

if necessary to local law enforcement officials and news media.

• Each field office should advise the Bureau and Miami Office if any

highly placed informants are in a position to travel to Florida to provide

coverage on hoodlum activities, which would be of significant value to the

Bureau. The Bureau will thereafter decide if the travel of a particular informant

is warranted.

section of Grand Bahama Island. This casino is reported to be approximately

three times the size of the Monte Carlo casino which is now in operation on

this island in the Bahamas. Numerous gamblers and hoodlums will undoubt-

edly be making plans to attend either the grand opening of the new casino or

visit it during the coming season.

(D) CHINESE UNIVERSITIES AND GRADUATE SCHOOLS - - In May, 1965,

the Bureau established on an experimental basis, a special index which provides

a central repository of names of individuals now in the United States who have

attended universities and graduate schools in Communist China. When

'established only four offices, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and

Washington Field, contributed to this index. However, it is believed this

index could be of substantial value to all offices.

Accordingly, when submitting results of an interview of a person

who has attended a university or graduate school in Communist China, you

should also submit a five by eight index card containing the following infor-

mation: (1) the name of educational institution and Chinese Telegraphic Code

numbers for the name; (2) location of the school; (3) name of the person inter-

viewed and Chinese Telegraphic Code numbers for his name; (4) interviewee's

current residence; (5) dates he attended the educational institution; (6) his

major field of study: (7) campus organizations to which he belonged; and (8)

FBI file number, Immigration and Naturalization Service number, or other

such identifying data.

Bureau will, on request, furnish you available names of other

persons who have attended the same school during the appropriate time period

and who may have information concerning your subject.

While it is not desired that a concerted effort be made to review

closed cases concerning persons previously interviewed for the sole purpose

of submitting index cards, you should submit a card containing appropriate

information when such cases do come to your attention. In this instance,

submit card by routing slip to the attention of the Nationalities Intelligence

WASHINGION, D.C. 20535

November 22, 1966

(A) FEDERAL CLAIMS COLLECTION ACT OF 1966 - BUREAU AUTOMOBILE

ACCIDENTS -- Under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, effective

January 15, 1967, agencies are required to attempt collection of claims for

money or property arising out of the activities of the agency. When the

principal amount is not in excess of $20, 000, the Act authorizes compromise,

termination or suspension if no indication exists of fraud, misrepresentation

or violation of the Antitrust Laws. Collection action may be terminated or

suspended only when it appears that no person liable on the claim has the

financial ability, present or prospective, to pay any significant amount on the

claim, or when the cost of collection is likely to exceed the amount of recovery.

The Act requires agencies to take aggressive action on a timely

basis with effective follow-up through written demands made upon the debtor in

terms which inform him of the consequences of failure to cooperate. Three

written demands, prepared at the field level, are made at 30-day intervals

unless a response to the first or second demand indicates further demana

would be futile. This procedure will apply to claims against third parties

involved in Bucar accidents and should be strictly adhered to. Consequences of

failure to cooperate should be stated in general terms such as "failure to

cooperate will necessitate collection through available legal remedies." The

amount owed by the debtor should be stated and documented. Bureau should

be furnished copies of any such letters and be informed of all responses from

debtors. As in the past, every effort should be made to have the debtor

reimburse the repair garage directly so that such costs will not be payable

from our appropriations.

Should information available to you indicate compromise, termination

or suspension of the claim expedient, Bureau should be promptly informed of your

recommendations and basis therefor, but the debtor should not be informed of

such possibility without prior Bureau authority. In the event referrals for litigation

become necessary, the following information should be forwarded to the Bureau:

Debtor's current address or name and address of the agent for a corporation upon

whom service may be made; current credit data, summary of actions previously

taken to collect or compromise the claim and any records and exhibits on the

claim. Regulations implementing the Act instruct that claims of less than $250,

exclusive of interest, should not be referred for litigation unless referral is

important to a significant enforcement policy or the debtor has not only the clear

ability to pay but Government can effectively enforce payment.

(B) CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS -- It is essential that cases having prosecutive

potential be immediately and thoroughly investigated so that court action can be

initiated at the earliest possible time. Therefore, effective immediately, in

every case where criminal prosecution is possible, all investigative activity

must be completed, including presentation to the U. S. Attorney and the filing

of process, within thirty days after a subject has been identified.

Failure to comply with the above rule must be fully explained on

the cover page in the initial report submitted to the Bureau.

SAC LETTER 66-73

(C) FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT - CHRISTMAS POST OFFICE FRAUD

CASES - Establish immediate liaison with local postal inspectors to assure •

prompt referrals of indicated false statements in applications for temporary

Christmas employment. The Postmaster General has recently announced the

Post Office Department has commenced employing 150, 000 temporary employees

to move an avalanche of early Christmas mails. While many of these employees

are already on Civil Service registers, it can be expected that a large number

of new applications for employment will be received by post offices.

Insure that the U. S. Attorney is given all pertinent facts, including

the point that these are not merely a series of isolated frauds but in the aggregate

cause considerable expense to the Government through costs of investigating

applicants and consequent need for recruiting replacements. In addition, the

danger to the integrity of the mails through the hiring of criminals for such jobs

is obvious.

These cases must be given thorough and careful investigative

attention by all offices. Although streamlined procedures are desirable to insure

efficient handling of these cases, they should not be treated as routine matters.

Particular attention should be paid to concealment of felony convictions.

(D) SPECIALLY FINANCED PROJECTS TO STUDY ORGANIZED

CRIME - Recently it came to the Bureau's attention that two well-known

professors on the faculty of one of our leading universities had obtained from

one of the country's best known and wealthiest foundations a tentative grant

of over $100, 000 per year for a three-year period for a study of organized

crime. It was only by chance, and not through any established, normal

liaison, that the Bureau learned of this situation despite the prominence of

the two professors and their school, the foundation, and the fact that

arrangements had been effected to obtain the services of a very prominent,

highly publicized police officer whose assignments and publicity had been

in the field of organized crime and criminal intelligence.

The Bureau must know of such matters in order that it will be

in a position to protect its own interests as well as the interests of law

enforcement generally. There is substantial reason to believe that in the

cited situation the persons involved opportunistically selected "organized

crime" as a subject of study largely because of its current popularity as a

topic in view of which it was considered to be a means of instituting the initial

grant, after which additional funds could be obtained for purposes more

directly connected with the principals' primary interests. Regardless of the

truth or falsity of this reasoning, the fact remains that a major undertaking

in a field where the Bureau has paramount responsibilities and interests

was negotiated without so much as a hint being reported to the Seat of Government.

Each Special Agent in Charge must be sure that there are

established liaison and sufficient alertness that we will have timely notice of

possible organized crime or related projects seeking foundation or other

financing. In each instance this occurs, the Bureau should be promptly

advised, accompanied by recommendations for action to protect the Bureau's

interests.

(E) VISITORS TO COMMUNIST CHINA - In connection with investigative

matters involving travel of U. S. citizens and resident aliens to Communist

China, an increase in the number of authorizations by the Department of State

for such travel has been noted since the change in State Department policy of

December, 1965. The Department of State is presently authorizing newsmen,

doctors and scientists in the fields of medicine and public health to travel to

China if their travel is related to their professional responsibilities. In spite

of the increase in authorizations by State, actual travel to China by such

individuals has been negligible due to China's apparent policy of only allowing

those persons to enter China who, for the most part, have evidenced sympathies

favorable to China. Practically all travel to China by U. S. citizens has been

unauthorized. Such visits continue to raise a strong suspicion of subversive

activity in the absence of special circumstances, and our investigations

concerning visitors to China should be keyed to unauthorized travelers.

Section 87D, Manual of Instructions, details the procedure to be

followed concerning foreign travel by subjects of current or past security

investigations and certain other individuals with subversive backgrounds. These

instructions apply in cases where travelers to China tall within the specified

categories. In cases not covered by provisions therein, the field shouid, upon

receipt of information indicating a U. S. citizen or resident alien has traveled

or plans to travel to Communist China, unless already known, conduct limited

inquiry to identify the individual involved, ascertain current residence and

employment and whether the individual has access to classified information.

Check office indices and determine whether travel was authorized. If travel

was authorized and no unusual circumstances exist indicating need for further

investigation or interview, no further action is necessary. Any interviews

deemed warranted should be cleared with Bureau. Unless further investigation

is conducted or individual interviewed, no communication need be sent to Bureau.

If travel was unauthorized, attempt to determine the reason for the

travel through available sources. Contact informants and, if necessary, place

appropriate stop with Department of State or Immigration and Naturalization

Service (INS) to insure FBI notification of the individual's return to the United

States. Upon receipt of information that the individual has returned to the

United States, determine his activities and consider an interview. Bureau

authority is necessary prior to such interviews.

Unauthorized travel to China could be a violation of Section 1185,

Title 8, U. S. Code and Section 1544, Title 18, U. S. Code. However, such

violations are the primary responsibility of the Department of State. Investigation

solely to develop evidence to prove a violation should not be conducted in the

absence of a specific request by the Department of Justice or State nor without

Bureau authority.

All pertinent information developed concerning unauthorized

travel to China should be submitted to the Bureau in a letterhead memorandum

for appropriate dissemination. In cases involving resident aliens, a copy

of the letterhead memorandum should be disseminated to INS locally. If

inquiries indicate the individual should be included or may be recommended

for inclusion on the Security Index, the data developed should be submitted

in a report.

Appropriate manual changes are being prepared.

(A) ELECTRONIC LISTENING DEVICES - ANSWERING PUBLIC INQUIRIES -- In

recent weeks, a great deal of public interest has been focused upon the FBI's use

of microphones and other electronic listening devices. Considerable information--

much of it grossly inaccurate--has been published or otherwise disseminated

creating the false impression that the FBI engages in extensive use of these

devices on its own initiative.

When false statements are made in their presence, as well as when

honest inquiries are received from responsible citizens, investigative personnel

of your office should not hesitate to provide a clear and forthright account of the

facts underlying our use of these devices. These facts are:

(1) The FBI employs wiretaps (or telephone taps) only with the advance

written approval of the Attorney General. From 1940 through June, 1965, wire-

taps were used by the FBI only in investigations involving the national security

(such as espionage and sabotage cases) and in investigations involving a threat

• to human life (such as kidnapings and extortion). Today, they are used only in

investigations involving the collection of intelligence affecting the national

security.

(2) In a "'Supplemental Memorandum for the United States" which he

submitted to the Supreme Court on July 13, 1966, in connection with the Fred B.

Black case, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall had the following to say

regarding the EBI's use of electronic listening devices (not telephone taps):

"Under Departmental practice in effect for a perioa of years

prior to 1963, and continuing into 1965, the Director of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation was given authority to approve the installation

of devices such as that in question for intelligence (and not evidentiary)

purposes when required in the interest of internal security or national

safety, including organized crime, kidnappings and matters wherein

human life might be at stake. Acting on the basis of the aforementioned

Departmental authorization, the Director approved installation of

the device involved in the instant case."

NW 55041 DooId: 32989525 Page 267

---

## Page 268

i .

The memorandum submitted to the Supreme Court by the Solicitor

General on July 13, 1966, further stated:

"Present Departmental practice, adopted in July, 1965, in

conformity with the policies declared by the President. . . for the

entire federal establishment, prohibits the use of such listening

devices (as well as the interception of telephone and other wire

communications) in all instances other than those involving the

collection of intelligence affecting the national security. The

specific authorization of the Attorney General must be obtained

in each instance when this exception is invoked. "

The above-cited facts clearly show that the FBI has employed

wiretaps and other electronic devices (a) only on a highly limited and rigidly

controlled basis and (b) with the full knowledge and approval of the Justice

Department.

Investigative personnel of your office should not go beyond the above

facts in answering public inquiries or in straightening out persons whom they

hear unjustifiably criticizing the FBI in connection with our use of electronic

• listening devices.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

(A) WIRETAPS AND MICROPHONES -- Reference is made to SAC Letter 66576

pointing out that considerable information, much of it grossly inaccurate, has

been published or otherwise disseminated in recent weeks regarding the

FBI's

use of wiretaps, microphones and other electronic listening devices.

On December 5, 1966, Congressman H. R. Gross of Iowa wrote me

concerning our use of these devices. A copy of Congressman Gross' letter is

enclosed.

Enclosed also is a copy of my December T, 1966, reply to Congress-

man Gross. It includes copies of a communication dated August 17, 1961, bearing

the then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's signature and a letter dated May

25, 1961, from Herbert J. Miller, Jr., to Senator Sam J. Ervin, Jr.

On December 10, 1966--after Congressman Gross had made my letter

to him and its two enclosures available to the press--Senator Robert F. Kennedy

issued a statement claiming that "apparently" I had been "misinformed."

On the afternoon of December 11, 1966, the Bureau issued a press

release pointing out that during Robert F. Kennedy's tenure as Attorney General

in 1961-64, the FBI's use of microphone and wiretap surveillances was known

to and approved by him. A copy of the December 11, 1966, press release is

enclosed, together with the three documents which were released to the press

as enclosures to it. These three documents are memoranda from former

Assistant Director C. A. Evans to former Assistant to the Director A. H.

Belmont dated July 7, 1961, and August 17, 1961, and a copy of the previously

mentioned communication dated August 17, 1961, signed by Robert F. Kennedy.

You should feel free to make copies of the enclosed documents for

the use and assistance of reliable news contacts of your office who may express

an interest in preparing special articles or editorials reflecting the true facts

concerning Robert Kennedy's knowledge and approval of FBI microphone and

wiretap surveillances in 1961-64. Copies of all such articles and editorials

should promptly be furnished to the Crime Records Division.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

It has come to my attention that there have been many news stories

that have indicated that the FBI has engaged in "eavesdropping" and

wire tapping without authorization from the Attorney General. There

have been statements from former Attorneys General indicating, if

not saying, that they did not authorize some of the "eavesdropping"

in a number of well publicized cases.

It had been my impression in the past that the FBI engaged in "eaves-

dropping" and wire tapping only upon authority from the Attorney Gen-

eral. It was my understanding that the FBI has adhered to this pol-

icy, and that there exists "full documentation" of the fact that

the

FBI actions were authorized by the Attorney General.

I would appreciate it if you would send me any documentation that

you have that authorized the FBI "eavesdropping" that resulted in

the overhearing of the conversations of Robert G. (Bobby) Baker,

Fred B. Black, Edward Levinson and Benjamin Sigelbaum.

If there is some reason why the documentation itself cannot be sent

to me in any of these cases, I would appreciate your assurance that

such documentation exists with the name of the Attorney General,

Deputy Attorney General, or other Justice Department official who

gave the authorization.

I am sure that you will want this matter cleared up as much as I

do. I dislike seeing the good name of the FBI damaged by what would

appear to be unfounded allegations that the agency was acting with-

out authority from an Attorney General.

Honorable H. R. Gross

House of Representatives

Washington, D. C. 20515

My dear Congressman:

I welcome the opportunity to answer your letter of

December 5, 1966. The questions you raised were most incisive.

I have always felt that the Congress, in representing the general

public, has every right to know the true facts of any controversy.

This is the policy I have always practiced when appearing before

the appropriations committees of the Congress; consequently, 1

feel compelled to do likewise in replying to your letter.

Your impression that the FBI engaged in the usage

of wiretaps and microphones only upon the authority of the Attorney

General of the United States is absolutely correct. You are also

correct when you state that it is your understanding that "full

documentation" exists as proof of such authorizations.

All wiretaps utilized by the FBI have always been

approved in writing, in advance, by the Attorney General.

As examples of authorization covering the period in

which you were specifically interested, you will find attached to

this letter a communication dated August 17, 1961, signed by former

Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, in which he approved policy for

the usage of microphones covering both security and major criminal

cases. Mr. Kennedy, during his term of office, exhibited great

interest in pursuing such matters and, while in different metropolitan

areas, not only listened to the results of microphone surveillances

but raised questions relative to obtaining better equipment. He was

briefed frequently by an FBI official regarding such matters. FBI

usage of such devices, while always handled in a sparing, carefully

controlled manner and, as indicated, only with the specific authority

of the Attorney General, was obviously increased at Mr. Kennedy's

insistence while he was in office.

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 271

Honorable H. R. Gross

I thought you might like to know that the Congress

has been advised by the Department of Justice on occasion regarding

FBI usage of electronic equipment, both in the internal security and

organized crime fields. Senator Sam J. Exvin, Jr., wrote

Mr. Kennedy's assistant, Herbert J. Miller, Jr., Assistant Attorney

General, Criminal Division, on May 19, 1961, relative to this matter.

Mr. Miller, under date of May 25, 1961, in reply, indicated the

complete knowledge of the Department of Justice in such matters in

that the specific number and areas of usage were definitely pinpointed.

A copy of Mr. Miller's letter is attached.

I had a conference with the then Attorney General

Nicholas deB. Katzenbach on March 30, 1965, in which I made recom-

mendations similar to those I had made to each successive Attorney

General following the administration of Attorney General Tom C. Clark.

Such recommendations concerned strong, simple control by the Attorney

General of procedures affecting electronic devices utilized by all Federal

investigative agencies. President Lyndon B. Johnson on June 30, 1965,

issued a memorandum to all Executive departments and agencies pro-

hibiting wiretapping in all cases except those related to the internal

security of the United States. This prohibition included the fact that

no interception was to be undertaken or continued without first obtaining

the approval of the Attorney General. This, of course, is the practice

which has always been followed by the FBI.

I can assure you, backed by the proven record of long

years of service, both by myself and the many career personnel of this

Bureau, that the FBI has never operated in an irresponsible, unauthorized

or uncontrolled manner. To reiterate, the minute number of electronic

devices used have been authorized by the Attorney General. I would not

allow practices to exist otherwise.

It was good of you to write me, and your interest in our

activities is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Began sire

Dear Senator:

Thank you for your letter of May 19, 1961.

I have been advised that as of February 8, 1960, the

Federal Bureau of Investigation maintained 78 wiretaps.

You also request information "relative to the nature

and extent of the use of electronic eavesdropping apparatus by

agents of the Department of Justice." I have checked with the

Federal Bureau of Investigation and, as in the case of wire-

tapping, the technique of electronic listening devices is used on

a highly restricted basis. The Federal Bureau of Investigation

has 67 of these devices in operation. The majority are in the

field of internal security with a few used to obtain intelligence

information with regard to organized crime.

The Department feels the information in the third

paragraph should remain confidential. However, whether the

information should be made public is left with your discretion.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DECEMBER 11, 1966

FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover today labeled as "absolutely

inconceivable" the December 10, 1966, statement of Senator Robert F.

Kennedy -- a statement in which Mr. Kennedy implied that Mr. Hoover

had been misinformed concerning Mr. Kennedy's knowledge of the use

of electronic listening devices by the FBI during his tenure as Attorney

General in 1961-64. Senator Kennedy's statement attached a letter

dated February 17, 1966, from a former FBI employee, Mr. Courtney

A. Evans, which reflects that Mr. Evans "did not discuss the use" of

microphones with Mr. Kennedy - nor did Evans "know of any written

material that was sent to you (the then Attorney General Kennedy) at

any time concerning this procedure. "

Mr. Hoover said it is absolutely inconceivable that either

Senator Kennedy or Mr. Evans can make such a statement. He pointed

out that official records of the FBI not only reflect discussions between

former Attorney General Kennedy and Mr. Evans concerning the FBI's

use of microphone surveillances, but also contain documents -- including

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 274

---

## Page 275

some bearing Mr. Kennedy's signature or initials -- showing that the

FBI's use of microphone and wiretap surveillances was known to and

approved by Mr. Kennedy.

Mr. Evans, who retired from the FBI in 1964, now is an

official associated with the Department of Justice.

Attached to this statement are two memoranda personally

prepared by Mr. Evans to one of his superiors. One memorandum

is dated July 7, 1961, and the other is dated August 17, 1961. Both

relate to discussions which Mr. Evans had with the then Attorney

General Kennedy concerning the use of microphone surveillances by

the FBI.

In the August 17, 1961, memorandum, Mr. Evans states

that the matter of using leased telephone lines in connection with

microphone surveillances "was discussed with the Attorney General"

and that the "Attorney General approved the proposed procedure in

this regard and personally signed the attached memorandum evidenc-

ing such approval, " (Also attached is a copy of the August 17, 1961,

memorandum signed by Mr. Kennedy.)

In his July 7, 1961, memorandum, Mr. Evans states

that he contacted the Attorney General that day "relative to his

(Mr. Kennedy's) observation as to the possibility of utilizing

'electronic devices' in organized crime investigations. " Mr. Evans'

memorandum reports that the then Attorney General Kennedy "was

pleased we had been using microphone surveillances... in organized

crime matters."

In line with the Director's approval, the Attorney General was

conside i mili let one e tea ve to anised ration estations.

It was pointed out to the Attorney General that we had taken action

with regard to the use of microphone surveillances in these cases and while

they represented an expensive investigative step, we were nevertheless utilizing

them in all instances where this was technically feasible and where valuable

information might be expected. The strong objections to the utilization of

telephone taps as contrasted to microphone surveillances was stressed. The

Attorney General stated he recognized the reasons why telephone taps should

be restricted to national defense type cases and he was pleased we had been

using microphone surveillances where these objections do not apply wherever

possible in organized crime matters.

The Attorney General noted that he had approved several technical

surveillances in connection with security-type investigations since he took

office, but that he had not kept any record and didn't really know what he had

approved and what survelllances were currently in operation. He said that for

his own information he would like to see a list of the technical surveillances

now in operation. He added that this could be brought over to him personally

and that he would look it over and immediately return it because he realized

the importance of having these records maintained under the special security

conditions which only the FBI had.

If the Director approves, we will have the list of technical

surveillances prepared, delivered personally to the Attorney General and

then returned to the Bureau's file.

WASHINGION 25. D. C.

August 17, 1961

In connection with the use of microphone

surveillances it is frequently necessary to lease a special telephone

line in order to monitor such a surveillance. These situations

occur when it is impossible to locate a secure monitoring point

in the immediate vicinity of the premises covered by the microphone.

Even though a special telephone line is utilized, this activity in

no way involves any interception of telephonic communications and

is not a telephone tap.

In the New York City area the telephone company

has over the years insisted that a letter be furnished to the telephone

company on each occasion when a special telephone line is leased by

the FBI. It is required that such a lease arrangement be with the

approval of the Attorney General. In the past we have restricted

the utilization of leased lines in New York City to situations involving

telephone taps, all of which have been approved by the Attorney General.

We have not previously used leased lines in connection

with microphone surveillances because of certain technical difficulties

which existed in New York City. These technical difficulties have,

however, now been overcome.

If we are permitted to use leased telephone

lines as an adjunct to our microphone surveillances, this type of coverage

can be materially extended both in security and major criminal cases.

Accordingly, your approval of our utilizing this leased line arrangement

is requested. A sample of the letter which it is proposed will be sent

to the telephone company it a leased line is secured in connection with

microphone surveillances is attached.

Approved:

In connection with the use of microphone

surveillances it is frequently necessary to lease a special telephone

line in order to monitor such a surveillance. These situations

occur when it is impossible to locate a secure monitoring point

in the immediate vicinity of the premises covered by the microphone.

Even though a special telephone line is utilized, this activity in

no way involves any interception of telephonic communications and

is not a telephone tap.

In the New York City area the telephone company

has over the years insisted that a letter be furnished to the telephone

company on each occasion when a special telephone line is leased by

the FBI. It is required that such a lease arrangement be with the

approval of the Attorney General.

In the past we have restricted

the utilization of leased lines in New York City to situations involving

telephone taps, all of which have been approved by the Attorney General.

We have not previously used leased lines in connection

with microphone surveillances because of certain technical difficulties

which existed in New York City. These technical difficulties have,

however, now been overcome.

I we are permitted to use leased telephone

lines as an adjunct to our microphone surveillances, this type of coverage

can be materially extended both in security and major criminal cases.

Accordingly, your approval of our utilizing this leased line arrangement

is requested.

A sample of the letter which it is proposed will be sent

to the telephone company if a leased line is secured in connection with

microphone surveillances is attached.

Approved:

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

January 28, 1975

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) SPECIAL AGENT RECRUITMENT PROGRAM - Commencing

immediately, the one-year waiting period for retesting Special Agent™

(Accountant) applicants who fail the accounting test is being temporarily

reduced. Such applicants can be reexamined using a different accounting

test in six months or after the completion of a Certified Public Accountant

(CPA) review course, whichever is earlier. This, of course, applies

only to applicants who have initially been recommended as outstanding

candidates and, in every instance, before retesting, you should obtain

Bureau authority to do so. This change in retesting applies only to

Special Agent (Accountant) applicants and includes both those from within

and from outside the Bureau.

MEMORÄNDUM 5-75

(B) SPECIAL AGENT TRANSFERS - Reference is made to Memorandum

to All Special Agents in Charge, 9-74, wherein the Bureau's transfer policy

was outlined. Difficulty has been experienced in attempting to implement

this policy due to the fact that there has been a paucity of new Agents during

the past year.

The Bureau intends to make every effort which will permit

Agents in their first office of assignment to remain in that division for a

period of two to three years, consistent, of course, With our overall

manpower needs. Because of this, there may be instances when an Agent

will not be able to remain in his first office of assignment for the period

specified above. As you are aware, the Bureau has found it necessary in

the recent past to transfer a substantial number of Agents to some of our

larger offices so that we might better fulfill our responsibilities in the

counterintelligence field. It is anticipated that we will have to continue to

make such transfers.

The Bureau has received a number of inquiries concerning the

desirability of Agents in their first office of assignment purchasing homes.

First office Agents should bear in mind that while every effort will be made

to keep them in their first office for a two-to-three-year period, it well

may be that they will have to be transferred prior to that time to fill pressing

manpower needs in other divisions,

such as the number and date of issue of a National Bank Charter, Federal

Deposit Insurance Corporation certificate, Federal Savings and Loan

obtained during the initial contact at the victim financial institution and

set forth in the first report together with the identity of its custodian

within the financial institution to be subpoenaed in the event of trial.

(E) THEFT OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY MATTERS -- Theft of

Government Property is a matter of considerable concern not only to

the FBI but to a number of Governmental agencies throughout the

United States. One such agency that recently expressed such a concern

is the General Services Administration (GSA) which has approximately

10, 000 properties under its charge and control. GSA is authorized by

-statute, Title 40, -USC, Section-318-318d,- to maintain, operate; and-

protect property under its jurisdiction, and its investigators, pursuant

to this statute, while on real property under the charge and control of

GSA, have the power to enforce Federal laws for the protection of

persons and property. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) of GSA

has approximately 35 investigators assigned to the 10 regions of GSA

throughout the United States and it is their responsibility to provide that

protection. They also investigate and report on Theft of Government

Property matters pursuant to the authority of Title 40, USC, Section

318-318d.

FPS investigators have been directed to coordinate and confer

with FBI Offices in order to preclude interfering with any matter inder

FBl jurisdiction. CSA is aware that the FBI has primary investigative

jurisdiction in Theft of Government Property matters; however, it is

concerned with those minor-type violations that occur in buildings

under its control where no investigation is conducted by the FBI because

of the provisions set forth on Page 95, Part III, of the FBI Handbook.

-

GSA has advised that in many of these instances local authorities likewise

conduct no or very limited investigation.

Because of a noticeable increase in crime-related incidents

occurring on properties under its control, particularly thefts, GSA has

endeavored to show prompt responsiveness and visibility of its presence

to the tenants of these properties. In this manner GSA has attempted to

assert itself in an effort directed at reducing these crimes and desires

to create an awareness of its function, foster cooperation with, and

assist all law enforcement agencies in reducing these crimes.

The foregoing is being brought to your attention as the

detection and prevention of crime, as well as the prosecution of those

responsible, are of paramount importance to all law enforcement

agencies. Any encroachment, however, upon FBI jurisdiction is to be

challenged and resolved without delay.

(F) LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING AT'FBI ACADEMY -- SAC

Memorandum 61-74, dated December 24, 1974, set forth the new

policy that all Agents attending In-Service training will arrive at

the FBI Academy on Sunday evening rather than on Monday morning.

Effective upon receipt of this memorandum, all law enforcement

classes will adhere to the same policy.. In effect, all students

coming to the Academy will follow one set of regulations. -

Each field office will advise Training Division of Agents

and police officers who plan to drive personally owned automobiles

to Quantico at least one week prior to the beginning of their class

session. This is the only means by which the Bureau can have the " wi

appropriate number of buses available for transportation. The only

exception to this policy will be those police officers attending Anti-

Sniper and Survival Training and they will continue the policy of

taking a taxi from whatever airport they arrive since they come in

groups of five.

The Dining Hall at the Academy cloges at 6:30 p.m.

on Sunday, but the Snack Bar serves sandwiches and beverages until

11:00 p.m., on a cash basis.

(G) FBIRA MATTER - INTEROFFICE FIREARMS COMPETITION -- The

Interoffice Firearms Competition Shoot was recently reevaluated and the

FBIRA will no longer sponsor this competition. The following lactors were

considered in arriving at this decision: (1) the supervision and Agent time

required to administer this shoot in the field and at Quantico is sub-

stantial; (2) the annual cost. for handling this program in the Computer -

Systems Division is approximately $1, 450; (3) due to the handicap

system, the office with the best shooters does not necessarily win and,.

therefore, it is not a measure or reward for the best shooting office;

(4) due to changes in the firearms training program, the Practical Pistol

Course (PPC) which is used in this particular shoot is no longer required

in the field (except for this shoot) and has been replaced by more advanced

courses; and (5) it is apparent that enthusiasm in this activity has

diminished over the years.

Inasmuch as the field has already been furnished the firearms

training program for this calendar year, there will be no change and the

PPC will remain in the program as previously set forth. The reason the

PPC will remain in the schedule during this calendar year is to give

Agents an opportunity to earn a Possible medal. A new course is being

developed to replace the PPC which will still give Agents an oppoitunity

to earn a Possible medal and will be included in the 1976 field firearms

training schedule.

February 11, 1975

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) PUBLIC LAW 93-350 - SUPPLEMENTAL CIVIL SERVICE

COMMISSION (CSC) RETIREMENT REGULATIONS - As will be

recalled, information concerning the effect of enactment of P. L.

93-350 on retirement benefits for Special Agent personnel was

furnished in airtel to all Divisions and Legal Attaches, dated July 26,

1974. The Bureau is now in receipt of supplemental regulations issued

by the CSC, and the following is furnished you for your assistance in

responding to inquiries from eligible employees contemplating

retirement.

Effective with the first pay period which began after

December 31, 1974 (January 5, 1975), retirement withholdings and

agency contributions to the retirement fund are at a rate of 7 1/2%, and

such are mandatory for an empicyee covered as a 'law enforcement

officer" or "firefighter." If, at retirement, an employee who has had

the 7 1/2% deduction withheld while in a covered position; does not

qualify for the special liberalized computation (2 1/2% for each of the

first 20 years of service, and 2% for all years thereafter, with premium

overtime pay included with base salary for annuity computation purposes),

there is no refund of the extra withholdings.

Concerning retirement claims, an employee who retires

under any of the other retirement provisions (e.g., disability or deferred

retirement) cannot get the special computation formula provided under

the law entorcement/ firefighter provisions, nor is the additional amount

of withholdings refundable. Premium pay received by an employee in such

covered positions (after December 31, 1974), that is included as basic

pay, will be considered for high-three average purposes, even though the

employee does not retire under the special provisions for law enforcement

officers and firefighters.

Appropriate Manual revisions will follow.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

April 22, 1975

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A) EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY --

Enclosed is a memorandum to the Heads of Departments

and Agencies signed by President Ford March 6, 1975, on equal

opportunity in Federal employment which you should bring to the

attention of all supervisors and employees in your office. I want to

take this opportunity to add to long.standing Bureau policy my

personal commitment to the principles of equal employment opportunity.

I join with the President in the theme that equal opportunity in employ-

ment becomes a reality principally through the positive actions of

those in supervisory positions and that vigorous efforts in this regard

must be continued and expanded. Application of the spirit and meaning

vi equal opportunity in employment must prevail in every segment of

our organization. I will afford this matter continued attention and

expect each of you to renew personal efforts in support of this program.

The President has specifically addressed the need for strong

affirmative actions to assure that all persons have an opportunity to

compete on a fair and equal basis for employment and advancement in

the Federal Government. In this connection, your attention is directed

to the Bureau's positive Equal Employment Opportunity Program aimed

primarily at circulating opportunities in the FBI for minority groups

and women, attracting those interested in qualifying and at fully utilizing

the abilities of all employees. Your leadership in this area is demon-

strated when your program is such that you move promptly and

aggressively without awaiting instructions from FBIHQ. Particular

attention should also be paid to the staffing of your own field offices.

As Special Agents in Charge, you are responsible for recruiting your own

clerical personnel and are expected to afford continued concentration

to assuring your staffs are fully representative in terms of minority

employees.

(B) UNITED STATES SAVINGS BOND CAMPAIGN - 1975 - 1

• The 1975

Savings Bond Campaign will commence May 1, 1975 and will extend

through May 30, 1975.

Goals this year are to increase our participation

by 10% and persuade 50% of those participating to increase their allotments.

These Bonds may be purchased by executing form FD-308 and

forwarding same to the Bureau, Attention: Data Processing Section, which

will, under the Payroll Savings Plan, withhold the amount employee allots

per pay period until the Bond is paid for. Official Bureau names and

accurate Social Security Numbers must be used on applications which

should be typed or legibly printed.

As of March 15, 1975, only 47.7% of all FBI employees were

participating in this program. Each employee should be contacted at

least once to insure he or she is aware of the advantages of buying

United States Savings Bonds. I would appreciate your immediate at-

tention to this important program.

Bond literature will be sent to yoü before the drive. Also,

Data Processing Section will distribute reports to you at the beginning

and at the conclusion of the drive so you will be able to measure your

progress.

(C) INSURANCE MATTER -- In recent weeks representatives from various

insurance companies have been contacting Government employees, both on

the job and at home, in an attempt to sell supplemental Federal Employees'

Group Life Insurance (FEGLI). These salesmen have no official affiliation

with FEGLI or the United States Government even though they convey this

impression and can arrange to have their insurance premiums automatically

deducted from the employee's salary by payroll allotment.

Some FBI personnel have lost valuable benefits by canceling

FEGLI and SAMBA in order to subscribe to more costly and inferior private

plans.

This situation should be brought to the attention of all employees.

They should be cautioned to carefully evaluate established Government

insurance programs to make certain any supplemental coverage they con- .

template buying is not already available to them at a lower cost than that

offered by these private companies.

(D) ASSIGNMENT CARDS - FBI FORM BOOK -- As the result of a receni

suggestion, to facilitate the determination of whether an office is functioning

as office of origin in a case or handling it in an auxiliary capacity, the

assignment cards, Forms FD-1c and FD-Id, are being appropriately

revised to designate a space to enter office of origin. In making such

entry, it will be sufficient to use the teletype abbreviation of the office

which is origin. Until such time as the revised forms are available for

distribution, each office will enter the necessary information when the

assignment card is prepared by typing thereon, in the space below the

present preprinted items, the customary abbreviation for office of origin

followed by the teletype abbreviation as, for example:

0. 0.: AL

Appropriate manual changes are being made and Forms FD-1c

and FD-1d are being appropriately revised to implement this procedure

as well as to provide space for noting the date the file is eligible for

destruction.

(E) EXAMINATIONS OF EVIDENTIARY MATERIALS - BUREAU CASES,

STATE AND/OR LOCAL FACILITIES -- Materials of evidentiary value

located at a crime scene, or otherwise obtained during our investigative

activities, offer invaluable potential for investigative information and

probative results. The facilities and expertise of the FBI Laboratory

and Identification Divisions provide the best in available scientific

analyses and technical fingerprint services for these materials and should

be utilized whenever possible in matters of interest to the FBI. It may

also be pointed out that the Bureau is appropriated money yearly by

Congress to conduct its own evidentiary examinations and to have local

crime laboratories perform such examinations for which we are actually

being funded could result in criticism.

Instances may arise in matters of joint jurisdiction where state

and local crime laboratories handle materials obtained by local law en-

forcement agencies prior to our involvement, or have custody of items

located during their investigations of concurrent violations. Such situations

the exercise of diplomacy and good judgement to avoid creating

the impresston that the FBI lacks respect for the investigative, techmical,

or scientific competence of local authorities. At the same time we must

protect our interests in the event the matter at hand is ultimately prosecuted

in the Federal Courts since the U. S. Attorney cannot be certain that the .

more stringent federal safeguards for the handling of evidentiary materials

have been followed by state and local scientific and technical personnel.

When circumstances and good judgement dictate that consideration

be given to utilizing state or local fingerprint technicians and/or crime

laboratory personnel in Bureau cases the following conditions must be met

before your decision is made:

1. The SAC must be fully aware of the facts of the case

and the nature of the examinations) to be conducted.

2. Extenuating circumstances must exist which justify

SAC approval of the utilization of state/local facilities

and personnel.

3. As soon as time permits, the FBI Laboratory and/or

Identification Division should be contacted to assure

that all necessary examinations are being performed.

Bear in mind that concurrent violations frequently

require different elements of proof. State and local

facilities must thereiore be alerted to the nature

of Bureau requirements so that nothing will be done

to the evidentiary material that will destroy its

usefulness from our standpoint. They should also

be made aware of our willingness to consult with

them on scientific and technical aspects of their

examinations as well as provide additional exami-

nations that may not be possible locally.

4.

In each case where local examinations are conducted,

a copy of the report of same should be furnished the

FBI Laboratory and/or Identification Division when

such becomes available.

Under no circumstances should "curbstone" opinions be sought

of local scientific or technical personnel to assess the potential value of

evidentiary materials prior to submitting these itoms to the Bureau for

examination. Any preliminary local analyses could cause alteration

and/or contamination of these materials and a possible conflict of opinion

due to variation in testing procedures. This could severely hamper the

effectiveness of our efforts, as well as possibly unduly complicate the

"chain of custody." Appropriate Manual changes follow.

(G) POSITION CLASSIFICATION MATTERS - MASTER DESCRIPTION

FOR ACCOUNTING TECHNICIAN GS 5 -- Enclosed are two copies of

master description for position Accounting Technician (AT) GS 5, which

is being established due to the need to relieve Special Agent Accountants

(SAAs) of the more routine work in accounting investigations. Duties

set forth in master description for 75 to 100 percent of time should not

be changed in any way and every effort should be made to have employee

spend 100 percent of time on these duties, providing your office has

sufficient work of the type set out in master description. If this is not

feasible, other duties for up to 25 percent of time may be assigned which

should be as nearly as possible commensurate with the grade of the

position. These additional duties should be properly recorded, along with

appropriate percentage(s) of time, on the separate page attached to the

description. Type of supervision afforded each additional phase of work

and the official position title and number of supervisors) should be fur-

nished. Attached is a brief listing of suggested additional duties, not all

inclusive, which may be assigned to ATs. A detailed description of these

or other duties assigned should be furnished.

Lines 5, 6, and 7 of both copies of the master description should

be completed and descriptions forwarded to Bureau by transmittal letter,

FD-243a, in accordance with instructions in Position Classification Manual.

Complete justification for establishment of position must be furnished.

If you cannot justify need for AT position at this time, retain both copies

of master description for possible future use.

The AT will assist SAAs in review and examination of accounting

and other business records. The scope of any examination and the specific

activities of the AT will be determined by the individual case Agent and his

Special Agent Supervisor. In any investigative matter, the responsibility

of insuring a thorough and complete investigation will remain that of the

case Agent. An AT should not be assigned duties that would normally re-

sult in court testimony. Situations may arise wherein an AT might be

called upon to testify, however, these should be avoided whenever possible.

The AT should be assigned to the squad handling accounting matters and

the supervisor should insure the AT is properly utilized. Every Special

Agent having an occasion to supervise the work of an AT should be

thoroughly conversant with the AT's duties and responsibilities as set

forth in his position description. It will be his responsibility to insure

Upon the approval of an AT position in an individual field office,

_additional guidance for the training to-be afforded the ATs-will-be furnished

by separate communication.

After the AT Program is fully established and its progress has

taken form, it will be evaluated to determine if higher grade positions are

warranted.

The AT position is to be filled by persons possessing a four-year

degree in accounting from an accredited university or college who would

qualify for the SAA position except for age and/or accounting experience

and who have indicated a desire for future SA appointment. You may con-

sider any employee in your office possessing these qualifications for the

AT position provided there is sufficient work to justify the position. Any

requests to establish this position shoula be submitied io the Bureau with

full justification together with a transcript of the grades of the person

recommended. If you have a need for this position and cannot fill it from

your existing complement, you may recruit a qualified employee locally -

after approval has been received to establish the position. Submit a

transcript of any applicant's grades at the time of your recommendation

to initiate investigation.

The duties to be performed by the AT have been carefully re-

viewed and it has been determined they are sufficient to satisfy the one

year of accounting and/or auditing experience necessary to qualify for

the SAA position. Accordingly, anyone who serves in this position for one

year may be given SAA consideration provided he is able to satisfactorily

pass the Bureau's accounting test. In this regard, you should insure that

employees placed in this position fully understand that no commitment

is being made to appoint them as SAAs after one year. It will be neces-

sary for them to measure up in all aspects to the requirements of the

SAA position.

(B) CHARACTERIZATIONS OF SUBVERSIVE AND EXTREMIST

ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLICATIONS - The following comments

and observations are being made in view of upcoming June 1 reporting.

requirements in this matter.

As you are aware, characterizations are to be maintained..

in a current status at all times so that pertinent changes in the nature

of organizations are clearly shown as they occur together with the

dates thereof. Up-to-date characterizations are to be submitted to

FBIHQ promptly for approval as changes occur. This will insure the

currency of predications for investigations in which characterizations

appear as descriptive paragraphs. A change of an organization from

subversive to nonsubversive, for example, will eliminate the statutory

basis for investigation thereby pointing to the need to discontinue

investigation. When doubt exists in any given matter as to investigative

jurisdiction, correspond with FBIHQ, stating the facts and furnishing

appropriate recommendations.

Instructions relative to instant program are set forth

in the Manval of Rules and Regulations (MRR), Part II, Section 4, .

pages 21 to 23. FBIHQ has noted instances during the past year in

which these and related FBIHQ instructions have not been closely

followed. The following comments are pertinent.

When a characterization is submitted as an enclosure to

an initial report on an organization, or to a letter or similar communi-

cation, it should be prepared on letterhead stationery showing the date

and name of field office thereon. Below a characterization and

sufficiently separated by spacing, data should be set out concerning

any source whose information is utilized therein. Each characterization

is to be prepared as concisely as possible, showing essential details

but eliminating unnecessary verbiage.

The above-mentioned MRR Section instructs, when

characterizing an affiliate of an organization, that a statement should

be included showing affiliation with the parent organization, characteri-

zation of which should be handled on a separate page. That instruction

is hereby rescinded. Henceforth, set forth brief descriptive information

of a parent organization, or any other subversive or extremist

organization mentioned in a characterization, within the body of the

characterization. Such descriptive material should be an essential

extraction from FBIHQ-approved characterizations or substantiated by

back-up material in your files.

Refer to various field-wide character-

izations, prepared at FBIHQ, for guidance. Exemplifying this procedure

are characterizations of organizations and publications such as "Alhadaf"

(newspaper of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine), Fruit

of Islam (group within the Nation of Islam), and Young Socialist Alliance

(youth group of the Socialist Workers Party). This procedure will reduce

the length of certain reports and letterhead memoranda prepared in

security-type cases including Security of Government Employees and

Applicant-type matters.

(A) HOUSEHOLD GOODS - COMMUTATION OF EXPENSES FOR

TRANSPORTATION OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND PERSONAL EFFECTS--

The General Services Administration has prescribed changes in the com-

muted rates for transportation and storage of household goods and personal

effects and a copy of the changes is enclosed. The new rates are effective

for transportation begun on and after January 3, 1974.

All employees in your office who have occasion to submit

(B) AGENTS' ANNUAL TECHNICAL TRAINING -- II-1-1a, Manual of

Rules and Regulations, provides that Agents are to be afforded training

in technical subjects at firearms sessions, through use of equipment

on actual cases, and at other convenient and practical times. The

agenda for these training sessions have been provided by the Bureau

and the fact that such training was received by an Agent must be recorded

on his Form FD-41.

These instructions are being amended to a limited degree.

• It still will be necessary that Agents receive technical training at least

once annually but, in the preparation of an agenda, it will be within the

discretion of the SAC to choose those subjects of a technical nature which

he believes are of the most need and will be of the most assistance to

his investigative personnel. FBI Headquarters, from time to time, may

instruct that a specific subject matter be included in this program, as

necessity dictates. Record results on Form FD-41 as previously.

Agenda for technical training sessions must be forwarded to the Bureau,

attention Training Division, with a copy placed in the field office

control file showing the date the training was given.

(C) SECURITY OF INFORMATION --

By memorandum dated January 4, 1974, the Director of Central

Intelligence, United States Intelligence Board, concerned with intelligence

leaks, requested that all individuals with access to intelligence-type

materials be reminded of the following:

*1. In recent weeks there-have been a number of instances in

which highly classified material has appeared in the press. In some

situations these reflected a conscious release of information about world

developments by senior officials of our Government. Such cases are quite

appropriate in view of the necessity to inform the American people of

developments in conformity with our American constitutional structure.

"2. In some instances, however, the revelations have gone into

detail as to intelligence sources and methods well beyond senior officials'

releases and have apparently originated from independent release of the

information without authorization. While it is clear that information will

and must be made available to the public by authorized levels of the U. S.

.. Government, it is equally important that the Intelligence Community take

steps to protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods. Such

unauthorized revelations can:

"a.

Threaten the safety and welfare of individuals who may

be providing us intelligence at a substantial personal risk.

"b. Permit the identification of our sources and their

consequent termination.

"c. Lead other nations to make substantial changes in

procedures which terminate our access to information now

being collected.

"d. Produce substantial diplomatic and political difficulties

in our foreign relations.

'3. A number of actions have been taken to close this gap in the

security of the Intelligence Community. Personal representation by

previous Directors backed by strong expressions of Presidential concern

have been made. You have established security guides which, if scrupulously

MEMORANDUM 5-74

i NW 55041" Docid: 32989525

Page '305

## Page 306

followed, should reduce the number of inadvertent disclosures and limit

damage from deliberate leaks. These actions have had some success, but

in the final analysis the solution to the leak problem rests with the individuals

at all levels who have authorized access to classified materials.

"4. The responsibility for protection of foreign intelligence

sources and methods requires a personal commitment. It requires the

individual to take upon himself the responsibility to ensure the integrity

of the privileged information with which he is entrusted. It requires that

the individual accept the general and fundamental concept that one individual

cannot assume responsibility independent of proper authority for deciding

what should and what should not be revealed. It requires use of established

procedures when release of intelligence seems indicated for whatever reason. "

Details concerning classification and declassification procedures

under Executive Order 11652, which pertains to classified material affecting

national security, are set out in the Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II,

Section 4, paragraph M4.

1/29/74

MEMORANDUM 5-74

(D) CLASSIFICATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION -

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11652 -- SAC Memorandum 25-73, paragraph (B),

dated June 5, 1973, outlined policy with respect to the classification of

• documents which disclose an interest in a foreign diplomatic official or

establishment, employee, exchange participant, or officials and/or

employees of international organizations. For your further information,

practice of classifying FBI documents of this type should be limited to

those communications which indicate a security-type interest in the

individuals or organizations involved. No classification should be used

with respect to communications which relate solely to criminal or other

non-security type of matters, such as where a foreign official has been

the victim of a crime. This would include communications dealing with

investigations conducted under the Act for the Protection of Foreign

Officials and Official Guests in the United States.

taken for security reasons. Provisions of SAC Memorandum 35-73

dated August 28, 1973, paragraph (F) are rescinded at the time this new

procedure goes into effect.

COMMUTED RATES FOR TRANSPORTATION AND TEMPORARY STORAGE

WITHIN THE CONTINENIAL UNITED STATES, EXCLUDING ALASKA

SECTION I - TRANSPORTATION RATES

METHOD OF-COMPUTING ALLOWANCES: The amount to be paid to the employee for

transportation of his household goods (including any costs for packing,

crating, or related services) is computed by multiplying the number of

hundreds of pounds shipped (as shown on original bills of lading or other

evidence of weight shipped) by the applicable rate per hundred pounds for

the distance shipped, as shown in the aypropriate table of this section..

The distance shall be determined in accordance with household goods mile-

age guides filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. If the rate is

not shown in the table for the exact mileage, the rate shown for the next

greater distance shall apply. If the weight transported is less than the

lowest minimum weight provided in the commercial carrier's applicable

rate table, the reimbursement shall be based on the lowest minimum weight

provided in the carrier's rate table instead of the actual weight

transported.

(D) ASSISTANCE TO CORRECTIONAL AUTHORITIES -- A report,

"Revolutionary Target: The American Penal System, " issued December

18, 1973, by the Committee on Internal Security, U. S. House of

Representatives, discusses the problems facing correctional authorities

as a result of revolutionary and racial extremist elements both inside and

outside prisons. I have advised the Attorney General of my intention

that this Bureau assist-correctional officials-by providing appropriate -

information on the above elements.

As in the past, you should continue to furnish information

on the activities of revolutionary and racial extremist groups to Federal

and state correctional authorities when those activities relate to the

responsibilities of the officials. Also, you should advise those authorities

in your Division that, when requested by them, you will also furnish

information on the organizations, aims and activities of revolutionary

and racial extremist groups.

Further, you should advise the correctional authorities that

FBI representatives are available upon request to appear in training

programs held by those authorities in order to present information on the

pertinent groups. To provide information on racial extremist groups,

you should utilize appropriate police instructors and assure that objective

presentations are made in appearances before correctional officers.

-

As you are aware, it is Bureau policy that only FBI

Headquarters representatives are authorized to provide information on

revolutionary communist and New Left groups. Therefore, you should

forward to FBI Headquarters any requests for FBI representatives tọ

provide such information to training courses for correctional officers.

Also furnish any comments relating to acceptance of such requests.

MEMORANDUM 13-74

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

March 12, 1974

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A) SUMMARY ANALYSIS OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT

-SYMPOSIUMS --•

SAC Memorandum 42-73 dated 10/3/73 advised of

eight management symposiums to be held between 10/29/73 and

1/14/74 at various locations throughout the country. The training

curriculum for these sessions was developed in cooperation with the

Police Foundation, Bureau personnel from the Training Division and

professional consultants from the private sector. Ifeel very strongly

based on my own participation in these sessions and from information

that has been provided me, both informally and formally from the

participants, that this program was highly successful.

I have recently received a summary analysis of these

sessions from the outside professional consultants; Larry Kirkhart,

Ph. D., Department of Political Science, Louisiana State University

in New Orleans, and Richard B. Ross, Ross and Associates, Redondo

Beach, California.

For those of you not in attendance at the symposiums,

it is important for you to know the program was basically identified as

a training session in organizational change. The participants were

introduced to the concept of organizational change after which the pro-

gram focused on the FBI's organization. Techniques were employed by

the consultants to assess the Bureau's organization/ environment relations.

These included questionnaires and the dividing of the participants into

small groups representing a cross section of the bureau to identity

those areas they felt were the most important areas for improvement.

I think it is important that all of you be aware of their findings, based

on the imput from all participants, and what steps have been implemented

or will be implemented to address those areas of concern mentioned in

their findings. Naturally, I cannot provide detailed information on all

facets of their findings,, but I will address those considered the most

important.

Conformity - degree of feeling towards existing rules

and regulations to which employees must conform.

Evaluation: Slight decrease in conformity

requirements would enhance performance. The

actual (what is) and ideal (what.should be) scores

(based on a 10 point rating scale) were strikingly

- high. This seems to reflect a recognition that,

given the Bureau's purposes, considerable con-

formity is necessary.

Standards - degree of emphasis placed on quality

performance, high productivity and challenging

goals.

Evaluation: Bureau is functioning at a

high level but it could operate at an even higher

level. Both scures are quite high, actual and

ideal, which implies actuai and desired level of

performance are exceptionally rigorous.

Organizational Clarity - well defined structure with

clear goals and operational priorities.

Evaluation: Organization has a moderately

high level of clarity, however, a very high level of

clarity would allow it to be even more effective.

Warmth and Support - extent to which work

relationships are based on trust and mutual

support.

Evaluation: An exceptionally high level

of warmth and support exists and a slight increase

in this area would help stimulate more effective

performance. Both scores (actual and ideal) are

extraordinarily high.

Leadership - the extent that the organization 1S

staffed with leaders of demonstrated expertise

and the extent to which leadership is shared a.

opposed to being confined in a few individuals

Evaluation: Extent of leadership based

on expertise and extent to which it is shared

among many people is rather high, however,

a strong desire exists for additional improve-

ments in these areas.

Relationship Between the Field and Headquarters -

degree to which there is a mutual supportive

relationship between Headquarters and the Field

and this relationship is well defined.

Evaluation: Relationship has been effective

in accomplishing mission of organization, however,

broader dissemination of information from

Headquarters, improved flow of opinions and

suggestions from the field and clearly defined

role of SAC and ASAC would improve this

relationship.

Manpower Utilization and Development - degree

to which manpower resources are most effectively

utilized and properly trained for their assignments.

Evaluation: An enhanced leadership

development and training program and a more

explicit career path for investigative personnel

would be beneficial to the effectiveness and

efficiency of the organization. This also

includes the area of promotion and transfer

policies.

I have previously instructed the Office of Planning and

Evaluation (OPE) to conduct studies in many areas of the Bureau's

operations. It is encouraging to note the Bureau has already addressed

itself to almost every area mentioned in the symposium analysis. In

some areas, I have already initiated action. As you know there has

been a recent review and change in our transfer policies. The Role

and-Responsibilities of SACs_and ASACs is a major study and certain

facets of this study have been resolved and will be implemented in the

immediate future. The Career Development Program is another major

study and the career path for investigative personnel is being clearly

delineated showing opportunities, selection and promotion criteria and

training enhancements. This information will be disseminated to you

in the near future. I request that you refer to the memorandum to

all offices dated 11/28/73, captioned, Office of Planning and Evaluation,

Current Studies, which clearly describes other studies currently under- -

way by OPE. You have recently participated in the answering of a

probative questionnaire. This will be used to further identify those

areas of concern to which the Bureau must direct its attention. I intend

to follow through in all these areas to improve the Bureau's over-all

stature, effectiveness and efficiency.

Organizational change and improvement does take time.

The Bureau is moving in the right direction. The evaluations from the

private consultants indicate we can be justifiably proud of our organization.

We are, as they point out, very self-demanding and so we are looking

for ways to improve. I solicit your continued participation and support.

(B) TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM (TECIP) --

The keystone of an effective organized crime program is aj continuous,

well-planned, and aggressive TECIP. The Bureau has heavy respon-

sibilities in the organized crime field which cannot be adequately

discharged without strategically placed informants in all elements

of organized crime. The FBI has recorded significant achievements

in the organized crime field. It is your responsibility_to_make_-

certain that this momentum continues. This can best be achieved

through a revitalized TECIP.

Your program should be specifically aimed at broadening

coverage of the racketeering element in your territory. All controlling

organized criminal groups in your territory should be targeted for

attention.

You are also reminded of the need to expand your coverage

of narcotics trafficking. Continue to debrief your informants and,

where appropriate, provide them with direction to obtain narcotics

data which can be disseminated to those agencies having the primary

investigative jurisdiction. Your progress in this area will be cioseiy

followed.

It is expected that under your leadership the TECIP will

produce the results this program was designed to develop.

(C) UNNECESSARY FILING OF COPIES OF SECURITY REPORTS --

During the course of a recent inspection of a field office, it was

found that in many cases where reports were prepared and submitted

concerning a subversive organization, copies of this report were

placed in the main file of subjects who were active in the organization

and whose names appeared in the organizational report. Conversely,

when reports were prepared on individual members of the subversive

organization, a copy of the reports was placed in the main file of the

subversive organization.

The above procedure results in a waste of paper, filing

space and clerical time. Except in extremely unusual circumstances,

nothing of value is gained and it serves no useful purpose. Insure

that this is brought to the attention of all investigative personnel in-

volved in preparing security reports so that the above undesirable

practice will not be used in the future.

NMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(K) WHITE COLLAR CRIME MATTERS -- As you are aware, the field

supervisors who handle White Collar Crime investigations recently

posticipated in Seminars held at FBIHQ and the FBI Academy. I had

he pleasure of meeting each SAC, ASAC and field supervisor who

attended these important training sessions.

At that time, I reiterated to these men my desire that the

FEl not only continue its leadership in investigations of fraud and cor-

cuption but that we strengthen our efforts in this area of crime. I

pointed out that while approximately 12% of our investigative efforts

Maerow spent on White Collar Crime matters, in the near future this

Sigire may increase substantially in view of the extreme importance

of the White Collar Crime problem to the nation. In that regard, it

Jay well be that Special Agent manpower will have to be diverted from

ther areas to White Collar Crime investigations.

*I realize that different field offices have different individual

arblems and the designation by FBIHQ of a specific number of Special

Agents in each field office to work on such cases is not practical or

useful. However, I do believe the reputation of the FBI in the future

will, in large measure, be dependent upon the success we achieve in

the identification, investigation and prosecution of offenders in these

aises.Therefore, I would like to call the attention of each SAC,

(SAC and Special Agent to the urgent need for intensifying our in-

vestigative efforts against White Collar Crime.

With respect to the several suggestions which were made at

the White Collar Crime Seminars, these are being evaluated at FBIHQ.

The results of this evaluation will be appropriately brought to your

attention in the near future.

(B) ASSIGNMENT OF CLERK-STENOGRAPHERS TO RESIDENT

AGENCIES --

A recent survey was conducted of eleven field offices having

stenographers assigned to Resident Agencies (RAs) for more than three

months to obtain information regarding the advantages and disadvantages

resulting from such assignments. The offices were unanimous in their

endorsement of this program and no problems were reported. In order

to afford appropriate security, the RAs are kept locked when no Agents

are present. The survey disclosed that since the assignment of

stenographers, the delinquency in the RAs has decreased substantially

and Agents now make less frequent trips to Headquarters city, thereby

saving investigative time and fuel. Several offices reported that

stenographic production in the RAs is higher than in Headquarters city

and that morale is high, as the stenographers feel that they are closer

to the field activities and have a greater part in the operation of the office.

In citing benefits resulting from these assignments, one office

noted that experienced personnel with ability to work with very limited

supervision are necessary for such assignments to be of benefit to tha

Bureau. Other offices feel that the assignment of stenographers to RAs

has been extremely valuable to the overall effectiveness of the division

and recommend extension of the program wherever possible. One office

felt that this has been the single most significant step in recent years to

enhance the professional image of the FBI in the RA territory and to

increase the efficiency and productivity of the RA.

There are 489 RAs and the policy of only assigning stenographers

to RAs with eight Agents or more has been generally followed. There are

87 RAs with eight or more Agents assigned and 57 stenographers have now

been assigned to 47 RAs. In view of the very favorable comments

received from offices having stenographers assigned to RAs, it is suggested

that you consider the feasibility of assigning a stenographer at this time

to any RAs with eight or more Agents. It is felt that an RA of this size

will provide a sufficient amount of work to keep a stenographer fully

occupied at all times.

to be used for stenographic employees assigned to RAs were furnished to

you by Memorandum 1-74 To All Special Agents in Charge dated 1/8/74.

In submitting recommendations for such assignments, you should include

specific and-complete justification for the position and a statement

concerning the procedures for guarantying the security of the RA when no

Agents are present. Such assignments will not increase your overall

clerical complement as the stenographers will be handling stenographic

work that would otherwise be assigned to Headquarters personnel.

(C) MODIFICATION OF FUGITIVE'S NCIC RECORD -- During recent

inspections of FBI Field Offices, several instances were noted wherein

an office having a fugitive's record on file had overlooked in a communi-

cation new descriptive data regarding the fugitive. Consequently, the

fugitive's NCIC record had not been modified to add the new data.

New identifying data concerning a fugitive is extremely

important, and the subject's NCIC record should be modified to include

all new descriptive information as soon as possible. Conversely, data

which is no longer valid should be deleted from NCIC as soon as possible.

To prevent oversights, upon developing any data which should

be added to or changed in a fugitive's NCIC record, this data should

be set forth as a specific lead to modify the NCIC record in a communi-

cation to the office having the record on file.

Manual changes will be forwarded under separate cover.

(D) RETIREMENT LIBERALIZATION --

The Subcommittee on Compensation and Employment

Benefits of the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee conducted

hearings on April 24, 1974, concerning H. F. 9281 and S. 3263, bills to

liberalize retirement benefits for Federal law enforcement officers and

firefighters. H. R. 9281 is the bill sponsored by Congressman Frank--

Brasco of New York which passed the House of Representatives on

September 20, 1973. This has been the subject of prior SAC Memoranda

which outlined the basic provisions of the bill. S. 3263 is a relatively

new bill introduced by Senator Charles Percy of Illinois. It is identical

to H. R. 9281 except that it would provide for the annuity computation

factor of 2 1/2 percent to apply for all years of service and would count

premium overtime pay for retirement purposes retroactive to January

1970.

Thirteen witnesses appeared at the hearings, twelve of

whom supported the legislation. Senator Percy and Congressman Brasco

both appeared as witnesses in faver of the legislation.

Thomas A. Tinsley, Director, Bureau of Retirement,

Insurance, and Occupational Health, Civil Service Commission (CSC),

presented the only adverse testimony. His statement, however, disclosed

a marked change in CSC's position regarding this legislation up to the time

of the hearings. CSC previously had expressed opposition to preferential

retirement benefits on the grounds that it felt employees should not be

rewarded through retirement provisions for the particular type of work in

which they were engaged. Tinsley testified that the more liberal annuity

computation formula presently in existence "was not provided as a reward

for a particular kind of employment, but - - - - to make earlier retirement,

with resultant shorter service, economically feasible." Tinsley also

announced CSC was modifying its position with respect to the annuity

formula. CSC previously had proposed placing law enforcers and fire-

fightérs under the same formula applicable to all Government employees -

1 1/2 percent for five years, 1 3/4 percent for five years and 2 percent

for all years thereafter-but guaranteeing a minimum annuity of 50 percent

after 20 years of service and after reaching age 50. Tinsley in his state-

ment reported CSC suggested the present formula of 2 percent be retained

along with the guarantee for a minimum 50 percent annuity after 20 years'

service and age 50.

He admitted in his testimony this would be beneficial

only to employees who retire after serving from 20 to 24 years.

Among other witnesses who were very effective in

supporting this legislation were former Special Agent in Charge Joseph

Gamble who is now president of Wells Fargo; Edward J. Kiernan, president,

International Conference of Police Associations, Washington, D. C.;

Eugene Rossides, former Assistant Secretary of Treasury; and Ordway P.

Burden of William A. M. Burden and Company, New York City, who

testified as a private citizen interested in the law enforcement profession.

Senator Quentin Burdick, North Dakota, chaired the hearings.

In his opening remarks he announced that Senators John McClellan of

Arkansas, Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, Henry Jackson of Washington,

Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, and Roman

Hruska of Nebraska had filed statements with the Subcommittee in support

of the legislation. In addition, Senators Herman Talmadge of Georgia

and James Eastland of Mississippi have stated they are filing statements

with the Subcommittee in support of the legislation.

Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, a member of the Post Office

and Civil Service Committee, appeared briefly at the hearings and in an

impromptu statement indicated his support of this legislation.

Chairman Burdick has given no indication as to when he will

hold a Subcommittee meeting to consider this legislation; however, it is

anticipated that within the next few weeks this legislation will be brought

before the full Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee for action.

You will be kept advised of pertinent developments.

(E) INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOMB TECHNICIANS AND

INVESTIGATORS (IABTI) -- In March, 1974, captioned association was

established at a conference of bomb technicians and investigators at

Sacramento, California. A constitution for the association was adopted

and officers elected. The purposes and objectives of the association

are to foster an exchange of ideas and information within the field of

explosives, stimulate research and the development of new techniques -

within the field, maintain a high level of professional competence among

technicians and investigators, encourage the use of improved testing

procedures and methods of presentation of conclusions, and establish a

code of ethics for all members.

Membership dues are not to be less than $15 or more than

• $35 per year for all members of the association. There appears to be

widespread interest in the association by law enforcement officers en-

gaged in responsibilities for handling bombing cases. The association

will be divided geographically into six regions in the United States and •

one region for foreign participants, with each region establishing as

many chapters as needed. Police instructors qualified to lecture in

bombing matters are authorized to join the association at their own

expense. Submit to the Bureau, attention Training Division, the

identities of Agents who join this association, and we desire to be kept

informed concerning its activities in each region.

(E) SECURITY AND EXTREMIST INFORMANTS -- Recently an individual

publicly disclosed his confidential relationship with the FBI after voluntarily

furnishing information concerning revolutionary-type activities. This

incident reemphasizes the need for all Special Agents handling informants.

to stress upon the informants the necessity of maintaining the confidential

nature of their relationship with the FBI.

Each Special Agent in Charge is to impress upon Special

Agents dealing with individuals, whether they are Bureau-approved

or those voluntarily contacting your office, to proceed cautiously and

take all necessary steps to be reasonably sure that the individuals are

not plants, are stable, and are of such a character that they would be

unlikely to expose their relationship. In particular, you should impress

upon your Agents that each individual under development is a potential

plant. In this regard although it may not be possible to ascertain whether

an informant is completely reliable and not a plant, a reasonable amount

of time should be allowed to elapse before an informant is guided,

directed, or suggested io engage in activities on our behalf in order that

such a determination can be made.

The handling of informants is a very sensitive operation

and must be conducted on a careful and professional basis at all times. *~

Again, you are reminded that individuals who have not been approved as

informants should not be directed or guided in the event they volunteer

• to provide information without prior Bureau approval.

(B) SECURITY AND EXTREMIST INFORMANT PAYMENTS - SUB-

MISSION OF JUSTIFICATION LETTERS -- As you are aware, all

security and extremist informants receiving compensation from the

Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information furnished,

services rendered, and expenses incurred.

It is the responsibility.of each Special Agent in Charge to

insure all expenditures for information are on a strict c.o.d. basis

commensurate with the value of the information furnished. In this

regard, it has recently been noted that some justification letters do not

contain a complete detailed justification for monies paid to informants.

In the future, assure that these letters contain a complete detailed

justification in order that FBIHQ can make a reasonable determination

as to whether or not full value is being received for all monies ex-

pended for payments to informants.

In submitting your justification, avoid using generalities

and in each instance set out, under the summary of intormation fur-

nished, specific details of significant information furnished, includ-

ing examples. In other words, in addition to setting forth such infor-

mation as the number of meetings attended and/or the number of

individuals reported on, you must set forth specific information being

reported by the informant regarding activities of the organization

and/or individual which would warrant the payments recommended.

This matter will continue to receive careful attention at

FBIHQ and you will be held personally accountable to insure that all

payments are fully justified. These instructions should be called to

the attention of all Special Agents in your office handling informants

and sources.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) SPECIAL AGENT-WEEKEND DUTY ASSIGNMENTS --Field -

offices are required to have an Agent on duty on Saturday during

normal business hours, and some, depending on activity, have more

than one. A few offices, again depending on activity, have Agents

on duty on Sunday. Henceforth, when an Agent comes up for such duty

assignment,

, the workweek is to be administratively changed, to allow

the individual to have another day off to replace the normal day off of

either Saturday or Sunday, as the case may be. In the case of the

Saturday duty assignment, the workweek of the Agent, for that

particular week, is to be Tuesday through Saturday with normal

days off in that week of Sunday and Monday. In the case of Sunday

duty Agents, the workweek for that particular week will be Sunday

through Thursday, with normal days off of Friday and Saturday.

Should any of these official hours fall between 6:00 p.m.

and 6:00 a.m. the individual will be entitled to related night differential

pay, and if on Sunday to not over eight hours of Sunday differential

pay. No new work shifts involving such additional premium pay are to be

established without prior Bureau approval.

This should be placed in effect promptly. Duty schedules

should be established well in advance, in order that individuals concerned

may be aware of their responsibilities, and make any necessary adjust-

ments. Such weekend duty assignments are to

be rotated among the -

Agent staff of the office.

(B) DISTRESS SIGNAL FOR AGENTS IN TROUBLE - FM RADIO

STATION NETWORK - Recently a state highway patrolman was

taken hostage and driven in his own vehicle for approximately six

miles, and then murdered. Luring this period there were several

transmissions by radio with his hoadquarters and a prearranged

-signal could have alerted the dispatcher to his situation.-

Based on this incident a suggestion was made and

adopted that consideration be given to devising a uniform system

wherein a signal or code in conjunction with the Bureau's FM

radio network be used by an Agent held as a hostage when possible

to discreetly alert his office to his captive situation. A number

of proposals were considered and studied but each had numerous

disadvantages. A survey with selected field offices regarding the

proposed systems disclosed a wide divergence of opinion. Because

of these factors and the significant variations in radio procedures

among our 59 field offices, uniformity of any system adopted is not

believed practical for all offices. However, you should discuss with

all' investigative personnel the potential danger of a hostage situation

in a Bureau vehicle. It is also suggested that each SAC with his

staff consider possible radio code or signal procedure which could

best be applied in his particular aifice in such an emergency. If a

procedure is devised, it should be periodically reviewed to insure

that all personnel including new employees are fully aware of the

code or signal. I would appreciate the benefit of any developments

you feel have application outside four division.

AUTHORITIES REGARDING REVOLUTIONARY COMMUNIST AND

NEW LEFT MATTERS - FIELD POLICE TRAINING PROGRAM --

Reference Memorandum 8-74 (D) to all Special Agents in Charge,

February 19, 1974, captioned "'Assistance To Correctional'

Authorities, " relating to the availability of FBI police instructors to

provide information on racial extremist groups in appearances at-

training programs held by those authorities.

As pointed out in referenced Memorandum, only FBI

Headquarters (HQ) representatives have been authorized to provide

information on revolutionary communist and New Left groups.

Because of changing circumstances, and specifically the below-cited

development, this policy is hereby revised.

A national symposium on the American penal system

as a revolutionary target was held at the FBI Academy, Quantico,

Virginia, June 19-21, 1974. Individuals representing the penal

system from around the United States were in attendance. Agenda

included discussion of the targeting of the penal system by

revolutionaries of the Old Left/New Left representing organiza-

tions such as the National Alliance Against Racist and Political

Repression (Communist Party, USA, front), Weatherman and

Vietnam Veterans Against the War. During this symposium,

numerous attendees expressed the desire that FBI representatives

having knowledge of revolutionary communist and New Left matters

appear at their conferences and training programs as speakers.

To render assistance in this area, a thorough and current

knowledge of the background and developments in the revolutionary

communist and New Left fields is vital to the presentation of effective

briefings to law enforcement and correctional personnel. You are

accordingly authorized to assign your full-time security Supervisor(s)

of these types of investigations to present such briefings (even though

he may not be an approved police instructor) before duly constituted

police officers and sworn personnel of penal institutions. Submit a

Form FD-132 for each briefing commitment, and if a full-time

security Supervisor, who is not a qualified police instructor, is

given the assignment, note his qualifications on the Form FD-132.

philosophical or ideological discussions or debates with personnel

who are briefed on these topics. He should also be instructed not

to answer questions regarding specific topics that are part of our

investigative files, e. g., identities of members of an organization,

membership statistics, etc.

General background material is being prepared at HQ

and will be available for use in these briefings. It should be noted

that statements made by your personnel in line with the above

authorization are restricted to presentations before law enforcement

and penal groups and are not to be made before any other groups or

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT - PUBLIC LAW 93-253 - AMENDING

TITLE-28-UNITED-STATES CODE-SECTION 2680 (h) -- Reference is

made to SAC Memorandum 26-74 (E) dated 5-21-74. The Assistant

Attorney General, Civil Division, has advised that Section 2 of Public

Law 93-253, approved March 16, 1974, amends the Federal Tort Claims

Act (FTCA) with respect to Section 2680 (h) of Title 28, United States

• Code (USC). Section 2680 (h) of Title 28, now states:

"The provisions of this chapter and Section 1346 (b) of

this title shall not apply to any claim arising out of assault,

battery, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of

process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or

interference with contract rights: Provided, that, with

regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforce-

ment officers oi the United States Government, tho provisions

of this chapter and Section 1346 (b) of this title shall apply to

any claim arising, on or after the date of the enactment of

this proviso, out of assault, battery, false imprisonment,

false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.

For the purpose of this subsection, 'investigative or law

enforcement officer' means any officer of the United States

who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize

evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law. "

The amendment states that any claim arising on or after March

16, 1974, out of the offenses enumerated above by "investigative or law

enforcement officers of the United States Government"' may now be enter-

tained by Federal agencies under Title 28, USC, Section 2672. Upon denial

of the claim or upon expiration of the six-month period described in 28

USC 2675, suit may be commenced against the United States under the

jurisdictional grant found in 28 USC 1346 (b).

(B) CLERICAL RECRUITMENT PROGRAM - FBI HEADQUARTERS --

Due to your fine efforts during the recent recruiting drive for clerical

applicants, I am pitased to inform you that field office quotas will be

removed effective September 1, 1974. Since there is still a dire need

for Clerk-Typists at FBI Headquarters, you should continue your efforts

to recruit qualified Clerk-Typists through normal recruiting incidental

to the investigative activity. Agents now assigned exclusively to appli-.-

cant recruiting should be diverted to other investigative areas until such

time as it again becomes necessary to intensify our recruiting efforts.

The fine team effort displayed during this recruiting drive

is certainly appreciated and it is apparent that you have closely followed

this program and afforded it aggressive supervision. You must continue

to insure that all applicant interviews are thorough and penetrative so

that only those applicants who have above-average potential are considered

(C) FIREARMS - USE OF PERSONALLY OWNED SIDE ARMS BY

SPECIAL AGENTS -- Your attention is directed to Bureau letter to

Albany and all offices dated September 13, 1973, captioned "Firearms -

Use of Personally Owned Side Arms By Special Agents." As an enclosure

to that letter there was set forth a list of personally owned side arms

authorized for official use.

In addition to those weapons set out, you

are authorized to add to that-list the Smith and Wesson Model -10-6.-

Bureau permission for Special Agents to carry alloy-framed

side arms for official use is rescinded due to the fact that pressure

generated by the new service round would excessively stress frames

and cylinders of these weapons and inasmuch as certain repairs on alloy-

framed guns cannot be performed by our gunsmiths without voiding factory

warranties. This decision is supported by recommendations of the Sport-

ing Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute and the manufacturer

of our new service round.

Through the principal firearms man in your office, you

should insure that all Agent personnel currently authorized to carry

alloy-framed side arms execute form FD-431, deieting wese weapons

from their property records.

(D) ASSIGNMENT OF SYMBOL NUMBERS TO SECURITY INFORMANTS --

As you are aware, existing Bureau instructions state a symbol number

should be afforded to all individuals from the time any step, generally

the opening of an informant or source file, is taken to develop them as

sources or informants. However, these instructions do not set forth a

specific time period by which the Bureau should be notified of an

informant's symbol number.

From a review of the results of a recent inspection of a

large field office an undesirable trend was noted wherein there has been

undue delay in the submission of symbol numbers assigned to security

informants to the Bureau.

In order to clarify this matter, upon assigning a symbol

number, the Bureau should be immediately advised by secure teletype

of the symbol number, informant's true name, available background

information, and cover name, if assigned, for indexing purposes. This

matter should be called to the attention of all Special Agents handling

security informants and sources.

Manual and Handbook changes follow.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A) SPECIAL ACCIDENT AND TRAVEL INSURANCE (SATI) - OPEN

SEASON ENROLLMENT PERIOD, OCTOBER 15 THROUGH NOVEMBER

15, 1974, FOR LONG TERM DISABILITY BENEFIT PLAN --

The SATI insurance program is divided into three separate

plans. The Accidental Death, Dismemberment and Permanent Total

Disability Plan provides an indemnity to insured in event of accidental

death, dismemberment and/or permanent total disability. The

Accident Indemnification Plan provides for full reimbursement, to

limit chosen by insured, for all medical expenses resulting from an

accident. Since benefit payments are based on accidental causes,

employees may enroll in either of these plans at any time. The Long

Term Disability Beneffi Plan provides an indemnity for either

hospitalization or disability resulting from illness as well as acci-

dental causes.

The open season applies to this third plan, the Long

Term Disability Benefit Plan. Accordingly, in the event employee

does not enroll in this particular plan during the first 31 days

following entry on duty, it is necessary for employee to demonstrate

evidence of medical insurability, by means of a complete physical

examination, to enroll at any later date. All SATI benefits are in

addition to any other reimbursement received by insured from other

policies.

--

An open season enrollment period under SATI has been

declared from October 15 through November 15, 1974. Employees

may enroll during this period without providing evidence of medical

insurability. However, any pre-existing medical condition will not be

covered (for this particular condition only) if there has been any

treatment or medication within 90 days prior to the effective date of

10/17/74

MEMORANDUM 50-74

## Page 392

coverage. Following one year of enrollment any pre-existing medical

condition; including those requiring constant medication or treatment,

is completely covered providing employee is actively at work.

SATI coverage will become effective on the first day of

the pay period for which a payroll allotment has been deducted or. -

for which a premium coupon payment has been made. A supply of

the revised SATI brochures and Change Request Forms will be forwarded

in the immediate future.

New employees (less than 31 days service) or current

employees not presently enrolled in SATI should execute the enrollment

form and allotment form in the SATI brochure. Employees already

enrolled in SATI should execute the SATI Change Request Form and

allotment form in order to increase or change their present coverage.

Employees who already have two payroll allotments (maximum allowable)

may make premium payments through monthly coupon booklets mailed

directly to Wright and Company.

Under the Long Term Disability Plan an employee, in the

event of total disability, is currently eligible to receive 65 percent of

gross annual base salary up to a maximum insured salary of $27, 700.

Benefits, or course, will be reduced by any benefits paid to you under

Social Security or Civil Service Retirement Act, Bureau of Employees'

Compensation, Railroad Retirement Act, or similar Federal or state

legislation. If you have had a pay increase since the last open season

(October 1973) you should increase your coverage to your present salary

level, raised to the next highest $1, 000.

Since no savings allotments are deducted from the final check

of employee upon resignation, coverage under SATI is terminated the last day

of the pay period for which an allotment has been withheld from salary. (This

is not necessarily the last day on duty and is frequently two weeks prior to

that date depending upon notice given upon resignation.)

All forms should be promptly returned, upon execution

by employees, to Bureau marked for attention of Administrative Division.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A) FBI ACADEMY - LEARNING RESOURCE CENTER - DISSEMINATION

OF INFORMATION TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES -- The

FBI Academy Learning Resource Center (LRC) serves as the main research

and resource library for FBIHQ and FBI Field Offices. We are now capable

of offering these services free of charge to local and state law enforcement

agencies. Requests for information will be answered by letter or by fur-

nishing research monographs, bibliographies and abstracts of articles

relating to matters in question.

Procedures have been established which have opened avenues

for information concerning advanced technology of concern to law enforce-

ment which is reported in book and nonbook media. The Center cur-

rently houses approximately 60,000 items.

At the recent "Major City Chiefs of Police" meeting in Chicago,

it was suggested that the FBI might serve as a central repository and

disseminate information about research which is being done by police

agencies throughout the United States. To provide such service, I have

instructed that the FBI Academy LRC serve as a clearinghouse of infor-

mation for law enforcement by disseminating studies made by police

• departments throughout the country. All Special Agents, including

Resident Agents and police instructors, whenever and wherever pos-

sible, should inform law enforcement personnel, especially law enforce-

ment executives and command personnel, of the services available

through the LRC. Any inquiries or requests for information should be

made directly to the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia 22135, Attention:

LRC. At the same time, Agents should encourage those contacted to

provide input to this program by calling to the attention of the LRC any

research or experiments conducted with respect to the law enforcement

function. We must secure the needed input by police agencies so the

best and most efficient service can be provided to them in response to

their requests.

This program will allow Agent personnel more opportunity

for contact with the local police. It will provide a service to the police

and will afford an opportunity for the Agent to determine what, if any,

research has been done or is being done by the local police so this

information can be furnished to the LRC.

CHIEF CLERK'S OFFICES -- Refer to SAC Letter 60-21 (A) dated

April 19, 1960, and subsequent SAC Letters transmitting write-ups for

standardized-type clerical operations in Bureau field offices.

Standardized write-up for SEARCHING IN GENERAL INDICES GS 3 has

been revised and a new write-up for GENERAL AND SPECIALIZED

INDICES SEARCHING GS 4 has been prepared portraying the GS 3 and

GS 4 assignments. A copy of each of these two write-ups is enclosed.

The GS 3 indices searching position will remain on record

and fully operating. Qualifications for promotion to the GS 4 indices

searching position beyond usual considerations are that candidates must

have had at least six months' experience officially assigned to the GS 3

indices searching position and be certified by you in your recommendation

for promotion as having demonstrated effective performance of duties

with a considerable degree of independence and capability of performing

at the higher level. No trial assignment is necessary. Promotions

should not be regarded as automatic after six months of experience in

GS 3.

The supervisor of the GS 3 and Gs 4 positions should be the

same. At the GS 4 level incumbents should perform their duties more

independently, exercise a higher degree of initiative and judgment, and

their work should be reviewed only on a spot-check basis. This distinction

should be shown in the descriptions under the heading Supervision Received.

Carefully review the enclosed standardized write-ups and

shoüld you determine you can support a GS 4 indices searching position,

adjust your work operations as necessary and submit appropriate description

forms. With regard to the GS 3 write-up, since the title SEARCHING IN

GENERAL INDICES has not been changed, it will not be necessary to sub-

mit a revised description for the GS 3 position, providing employee(s)

will perform the duties as described in the revised write-up. If indices

searching duties do not occupy the full time of a position, the other duties

assigned should be as nearly as possible commensurate with the grade

level of the indices searching work performed.

Pertinent description forms for a GS 4 indices searching position,

and for any other position(s) that may be affected as a result of the estab-

lishment cf such a pesition, should. be submitted simultaneously.by.one

transmittal letter, Form FD-243a, along with your recommendation(s)

for promotion to the GS 4 position of the employee(s) you can certify for

promotion at this time.

(D) SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS - EXTREMIST

INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS -- The recent proliferation in

candidacies for public office on the part of members of subversive and

extremist organizations currently being investigated by this Bureau

under statutory basis has created a serious problem. Continued in-

vestigation of these individuals during the time of their candidacy could

lead to unwarranted charges that this Bureau is intimidating political

candidates and interfering with lawful political processes. On the other

hand, automatic suspension of investigation of an individual once his

candidacy for public office becomes known could result in termination

of an investigation where substantive violations exist. Such action

would result in the establishment of the unwise precedent of granting

investigative immunity to subversive and extremist candidates for

public office.

In the past, instances such as the foregoing were relatively

rare and were handled on an individual case basis. Recent political

activities, however, on the part of organizations such as the National

Caucus of Labor Committees; Communist Party, USA; and Black Panther

Party (which run candidates for pubiic office at various levels of political

life), coupled with the likelihood of civil suits being filed against this

Bureau by such individuals under investigation, dictate the establishment

of a uniform manner of handling such matters.

Upon learning of the candidacy for public office of a member

of a subversive or extremist organization, the office of origin should

promptly furnish FBIHQ with a communication suitable for dissemination

setting forth sufficient identifying data and a brief summary of the

individual's subversive or extremist activities, together with the details

of the individual's candidacy for public office.

In the absence of evidence

of a violation of a specific Federal statute, no investigation should be

conducted until subject's candidacy for public office is resolved. Infor-

mation received during the period of the individual's candidacy indicating

a specific violation of Federal law(s) should be furnished FBIHQ by means

consistent with the exigencies of the situation along with recommendations

as to additional action warranted. Other unsolicited subversive infor-.

mation received from sources and informants or obtained incidental to

other investigations, should be channeled to the individual's file and,

when appropriate, furnished to FBIHQ in disseminative form with recom-

mendations as to additional action warranted.

NW 55041 DooId: 32989525 Page 396

Results of candidacy in every instance should be furnished to

FBIHQ under individual caption. Should the candidate have been defeated,

necessary communication should contain recommendations as to additional

action warranted. Should the candidate have been successful, necessary

communication should contain statement that, in the absence of infor-

mation indicating a specific violation of a Federal statute, no additional

investigation will be conducted. At such time as the individual ceases

to serve in public office, the office of origin should submit such infor-

mation to FBIHQ, accompanied by recommendations as to additional

action warranted. Should information be received indicating a violation

of a specific Federal statute while the individual is in office, receiving

office should submit pertinent information to FBIHQ by means consistent

with the exigencies of the situation along with recommendations as to

additional action deemed warranted.

November 5, 1974

(A) DESTRUCTION OF FIELD FILES AND RECORDS --

Following extensive study and a canvass of all field

divisions, the following procedures have been adopted to provide .a.

more simplified file-destruction program for the field.

A - Files and records to be destroyed when 90 days old.

1 - Carbon copy of printout produced by NCIC terminal (retain

previous month plus current month

2 - Daily Report of Chief Clerk's Office

(FD-127)

3 - Encoded messages

4 - Field personnel files of separated employees when separation

was not for disciplinary reasons or for entering military

service. Electrccardiogram tracings and reports of medical

history (SF-93) are to be torwarded to the Bureau.

5 - Record of Registered Mail (FD-211)

6 - Number 3 Registers (FD-256)

7 - Transmittal letters - checks and bonds ..

B - Files and records to be destroyed when 120 days old. In auxiliary

offices, investigative leads requesting only record checks, when

• results are negative or of no continuing value.

C - Files and records to be destroyed when five years old if following

conditions are met.

1 - Noninvestigative files and material of no continuing value in

the following classifications:

a. Classification 1 - Training matters only

b. Classification 32 - Identification (Fingerprint matters)

c. Classification 33 - Uniform Crime Reporting

d. Classification 62 - Miscellaneous matters only

e. Classification 64 - Foreign miscellaneous

f. Classification 66 - Administrative matters

g. Classification 80 - Public Relations matters

h. Classification 94 - Research matters

i. Classification 95 - Laboratory cases, other than Bureau

• j. Classification 163 - Foreign police cooperation

D. Files and records to be destroyed when five years old if following

conditions are met.

1. Investigative files in all classifications in auxiliary offices

provided files are of no continuing value for evidentiary,

intelligence, historical or other reference purposes or if

the case is one in which the Bureau-is office.of origin. In

Bureau origin cases, retain 10 years.

2 - Dead files in all classifications if of no continuing value

3 - Zero files in all classifications if of no continuing value

E. Files and records to be destroyed when 10 years old.

1 - Investigative files in all classifications, except security

classifications, in offices of origin provided the files are of

no continuing value for evidence, intelligence, historical or

other reference purposes. In security classifications the files

may be destroyed only if all the pertinent information therein

has been made a matter of record at the Bureau.

2 - Investigative files in auxiliary offices in cases in which Bureau

is office of origin.

If there is any doubt concerning the destruction of the above

material by an auxiliary office, it should consult the office of origin. If

there is any doubt about the destruction of a file in an office of origin,

that office should consult the Bureau.

With respect to the mechanics of such file destruction

in a field office, the following procedure should be followed:

A. Since there will be only two destruction rules, five years and 10

years, which apply to investigative files under the new regula-

tions, the case Agent will either note the appropriate destruction

rule on the file copy of the communication closing the case or

referring it on completion (RUC) or else note that it should be

retained plus appropriate justification for such retention. The

case Agent is logically in the best position to determine the

potential value of the case; however, his recommendation would

be subject to approval by the supervisor when the communication

is initialed for closing or RUC. The file would not be returned

11-5-74

MEMORANDUM 52-74

- 2 -

INW 55041 DooId: 32989525 Page 400

---

## Page 401

to the supervisor unless additional material were received

between the time the case was closed or RUC and the actual date

for destruction.

B. The master assignment card should be used as a tickler for the

final destruction of an investigative file. Heretofore, the Chief

Clerk's Office (CCO) posted the date_of the file.copy of the closing.

or RUC communication to the reverse side of the master assign-

ment card and the card was retained for one year and then

destroyed. Under the new system so that these master assign-

ment cards can be used as ticklers, the CCO, in addition to

posting the date of the closing or RUC communication in each

case, will note on the front of the master assignment card the

destruction date which was recommended by the case Agent

and approved by the supervisor on the file copy of the communi-

cation. Instead of destroying the card in one year, it should be

retained as a tickler for destruction according to the date shown on

its front side. In the event the file is reopened during the period

intervening between being closed or RUC and its actual destruction,

the new master assignment card would supersede the old tickier.

C. Index cards relating to the case should be retained for 20 years

and then destroyed as encountered.

D. Original FD-302s, signed statements and other items of evidence

will be retained for 20 years or until of no further value if that be

longer than 20 years. Index cards relating to this material would

also be retained for a like period.

E. Two lists containing the numbers of the files destroyed should be

maintained. One list will be filed in front of each respective

classification in the closed files section; the other list will be

maintained in an administrative file created specifically for this

purpose.

Manual changes concerning the foregoing procedures

are being made and will be forthcoming in the near future.

(B) UNIFORM COURSE OF LEGAL INSTRUCTION FOR FIELD OFFICES --

Recognizing the legal difficulties that often arise during major

minimum period. The lectures on these topics should not be combined

but must be thorough and given as separate subjects. Obviously,

additional legal instruction on the above subjects or other topics will

be afforded as the need arises.

It must be emphasized that the sixteen-hour legal instruction

program outlined above is a minimum uniform course. Topics included

in the uniform course are of a general nature that all FBI investigative

personnel must know whatever their specialized assignments may be.

It must be augmented to meet the particular legal training needs of

individual squads or situations arising within a field office.

The most desirable scheduling of instruction would be for each

Agent to attend eight two-hour sessions scheduled over the fiscal year-

This scheduling is not mandatory and in particular, the best method of

providing this uniform course of instruction to resident agency personnel

is most practicably left to the discretion of the field offices.

In order to provide the legal instructors with resource material

(F) REVISION OF SECTION 107 - MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS (MOI)

The Manual of Instructions has been revised, after extensive study at

FBIHQ, and in consultation with the Chicago, New York, San Francisco,

and Washington Field Offices, to include in one subsection of Section 107,

viz., Part II, all instructions dealing with the development and handling

of foreign counterintelligence (FCI) informants (to be called assets). The

new subsection extracts all instructions dealing with such assets from

current Section 107 and from several letters and airtels to all offices, e.g.,

"double agent letters."

The purposes of the revision are to encourage asset development

by redefining them according to roles specifically applicable to FCI investi-

gations, by providing for more local authority, and by incorporating all

instructions pertaining to FCI assets in one place; to streamline administrative

handling; and to bring some of our terminology in line with that of the rest of

the U. S. intelligence community.

The revision deals with assets who are primarily engaged in our

investigations of tho activities ef foreign intelligence services or governments

It does not deal with domestic subversive or extremist informants or inform-

ants used against elements who may have some connection with a foreign

political movement, but no connection with a foreign intelligence service or

government. These informants will continue to be handled under Part I of -

Section 107, MOI.

The major changes which are effected by this revision are as

follows:

10нт

(1) Foreign counterintelligene informants will be called assets,

either operational assets (OA) or informative assets (IA).

(2) There is no "potential asset" category.

By definition, an IA is one in a position, i.e., currently in

a position to furnish information of value; and an OA is

• already operational or has immediate potential to be

developed for a specific use. (The only time any asset

would be "potential" and not "actual" is in the case of an

OA during his background investigation, a minimal period

of time which does not justify another formal administrative

category.)

(3) FBIHQ authority is required to conduct in-depth background

investigation and development of an FCI asset under the age

of 21.

This is more restrictive than the current age limit of 18.

Because of the sensitivity of FCI cases, and the rarity of

assets under 21 in FCI cases, the more conservative position

was adopted.

(4) The asset's symbol number suffix will specifically identify

whether he is an informative asset or an operational asset,

e. g., NY 1001-OA (or IA).

This will allow for more ready evaluation of the information

provided by an asset.

"(5) The caption of FCI asset cases will he his symbol, number,..

plus IS and the country concerning which the asset is primarily

reporting, e.g., NY-1001-OA, IS - R.

(6) IAs, except for certain restrictions, will be investigated,-

approved, and operated on SAC authority.

(7) All written interoffice communication regarding background

investigation of FCI assets is to be conducted by coded

"Nitel" only.

The sensitiveness of FCI cases, and the security of the asset

require this measure. An exception is made for a particularly

voluminous initial interview.

(8) Periodic evaluations of OAs and IAs paid on FBIHQ authority

are to be submitted by coded "Nitel" only.

This measure is essential for the asset's security since the

evaluation summarizes information provided by him and

tends to identify him.

DocId: 32989525

## Page 408

(9) Periodic evaluations of unpaid IAs or IAs paid on SAC

authority are made to the SAC.

Since these assets do not require FBIHQ attention in

matters of handling and payment, there is no need for

FBIHQ attention in evaluation.

(10) The DESECO Program is terminated.

DESECO has resulted primarily in inflated PSI statistics

and a large backlog of sources who are seldom activated.

The most productive method of targeting assets against

foreign intelligence officers (IO) is to analyze the personal

situation of a specific IO and the circumstances of his

particular operations, and then develop a source to

specifically fit his personal situation and one or more of

his operations. Experience indicates that more often an

individual whom we can initially recruit at the time he is

needea fits the situation better tanà DESECO.

The abolition of the DESECO Program will obviously result

in the numerical decline of security informants generally,

and FCI assets particularly; this is to be expected, and in

and of itself will not reflect adversely on any office. Now

the emphasis on source development in the FCI field is to

be on the development of sources who can be operationally

targeted against a foreign intelligence service immediately.

As with the rest of the MOI, this instruction is to be inter-

preted using the rule of reason. The term "immediate"

use of an OA must be interpreted to include a period of

time for background investigation,, a period of time for the

best or suitable targeting conditions to occur, e.g., cocktail

party, visit to establishment, etc., and perhaps a period

of time for pretargeting development. What the instruction

is intended to preclude is the creation of a large number of

assets (former DESECO and other PSIs) who are not producing

information of value or who do not hold immediate promise of

producing information of value in projected specific circum-

stances.

This does not preclude an office or squad from

(G) CHARACTERIZATIONS OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATIONS AND

PUBLICATIONS - Your attention is directed to the Manual of Rules and

Regulations (MRR), Part II, Section 4, page 41 (item 12. b. ), which instructs

that succinct descriptions are to be utilized when it is necessary to describe

or characterize an organization in a teletype that is to be disseminated at

FBIHQ on the Bureau's teletype network. You are reminded of this instruction

since FBIHQ has noted numerous teletypes, prepared for dissemination, that

have contained full-length characterizations of organizations. This unneces-

sarily adds to stenographic and/or typing time to prepare these communi-

cations, Agent and supervisory review time, and processing time at EBIHQ

to disseminate to interested Government officials and agencies. In utilizing

succinct characterizations of subversive organizations and publications in

disseminative teletypes, insure same is an essential extraction from FBIHQ

approved characterizations or is substantiated by back-up material in your

files.

Your attention is also directed to the fact that instructions

relating to characterizations in the MRR, Part II, Section 4, and FBI

Handbook for Special Agents, Part I, item 49. B., have been revised by

•deleting any reference to the Guide to Subversive Organizations and

Publications issued by the House Committee on Un-American Activities

(HCUA), revised and published on December 1, 1961. This was done since

information contained in the Guide is dated and is of little value in depict-

ing the present nature and activities of an organization or a publication.

Organizations and publications that were previously characterized on the

basis of material in the HCUA Guide should now be characterized by use

of other information demonstrating current or more recent activities

and/or affiliations.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) LIAISON WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES - It was

suggested to me at a recent Conference of United States Attorneys in

New Orleans, Louisiana, that meetings be held in field office cities

with representatives of other Federal agencies in the same manner as

on an FBI Headquarters level.

I am aware the Manual of Instructions, IV-102-23, requires

that each SAC specifically designate an Agent, or Agents, to be responsible

for developing and maintaining liaison with other Federal agencies, and

that these instructions are being followed. Ialso am aware that many, if

not most, SACs have other arrangements and opportunities for meeting

periodically with the heads of other Federal agencies in Headquarters

Cities, such as during regularly scheduled conferences, meetings

of the

Federal Executive Board or Association, interdepartmental intelligence

conferences, metropolitan police conference or association meetings, et

cetera.

I believe that periodic meetings with the heads of other

Federal agencies in Headquarters Cities, collectively, can do much to

engender and maintain a better understanding and working relationship

between the Bureau and those agencies and will result in advancing the

best interests of all. If no such opportunity currently exists in your

headquarters city, you should explore the feasibility of organizing such

a program, possibly with sponsorship of each meeting being changed on

a rotating basis. Representation from the local office of the United

States Attorney should be invited.

foreign offices, permit more thorough training and to establish a more

equitable and consistent standard of tenure and grade level, I have

approved a comprehensive program which is set out below. In the

future, investigative personnel assigned to foreign offices will be

returned to domestic assignment after a specified period. This re-

quirement is based upon the realization that such personnel must not

lose contact and familiarity with the ever-changing priorities, problems,

and objectives of the Bureau as well as sociological and related changes

in the United States. The program is meant to be a general guide and

it is understood that outstanding and unique periormance of an indiviuudi

or' circumstances peculiar to a particular Legat office, or best interest

of the Bureau will be taken into consideration and, on occasions,

exceptions to certain provisions will be necessary.

QUALIFICATIONS

Legat:

1. A well-rounded, experienced investigator;

2. At least two years of experience at FBIHQ or

previous experience as an Assistant Legat;

3. Fluent in one or more languages used in our

foreign offices. This will also apply to Agents

assigned to English-speaking posts in order to

achieve greater flexibility in use of personnel

for relief assignment or transfer to non-English

speaking Legat offices.

Assistant Legat:

1: Same as Number 1 above;

2. FBIHQ or field experience at the supervisory

or relief supervisory level, or other qualifying

(B) AUTOMOBILES - STEEL-BELTED RADIAL TIRES -- It was

recently learned that the use of steel-belted radial tires on police

vehicles in hot pursuit resulted in accidents causing the death of at

least one officer due to blowout at pursuit speed. Research developed

that such tires are not recommended by car manufacturers or tire

manufacturers on pursuit-type vehicles. The air pressure for such

tires must never be lower than 32 pounds per square inch cold. Running

such tiros at lower zir pressure creates very high temperatures which

cause the steel wires to get very hot, resulting in separation of the

plies. While the tire may not then blow out, once the plies separate

the tire is damaged to the point where the structure of the tire is

weakened and eventually a blowout or complete tread separation occurs.

Those offices known to have vehicles assigned equipped with •

' steel-belted radial tires have been instructed by direct communication

to replace such tires with radial pursuit tires of polyester cord con-

struction. Each Special Agent in Charge is to insure that any such

tires on any Bureau vehicle assigned are replaced immediately and

that such tires are not utilized in the future.

(C) SPECIAL WEAPONS AND TACTICS (SWAT) -- The effectiveness

of SWAT teams as a vital aid to the FBI--and to all law enforcement--

is a well-established fact. Through the proper utilization of these

highly trained units, many violent and potentially violent situations

have been satisfactorily resolved. Most importantly, the use of SWAT

teams has resulted in providing additional protection for law enforcement

officers and for the American public.

Despite the recorded successes of these operations, there

still exists some misunderstanding among elements of the news media

and the general public concerning SWAT teams. The role of these units

has been considerably distorted by some critics.

As you are no doubt aware, the SWAT concept equips the FBI

with a flexible and effective response to unconventional law enforcement

confrontations arising from our jurisdictional responsibilities. This is

not to suggest that the use of SWAT units must be reserved exclusively

for major case operations, nor is this to suggest that normal arrests

are to be conduated by SWAT-teams instead.of case agents. Rather, it

is intended that the SWAT concept should be employed in any situation

involving, what is in the judgment of the SAC, a higher-than-normal

danger risk.

As a general practice, the participation of SWAT teams in

an FBI operation should not be afforded undue publicity. Information

regarding the use of SWAT teams should not be furnished gratuitously

to the news media. However, all inquiries received from the public

and the news media should be promptly and accurately answered. To

assist with responding to these inquiries, the following is provided:

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) is a concept of operation

which is based on the premise that a small team of highly motivated and

well-conditioned individuals, especially armed, equipped, and trained

to function as a tactical unit in a variety of situations, can be more

effectively and safely employed in an enforcement confrontation than a

large group of persons not so trained and equipped. The basic FBI

SWAT team is a five-man unit.

It is believed that confronting a criminal or terrorist element

with a clearly superior force, such as a SWAT unit, will serve to diminish

any willful inclination to violent resistance, thus serving to accomplish

the objectives of SWAT.

(D) EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY - DESIGNATION OF

ADDITIONAL EEO COUNSELORS -- Reference is made to SAC letter

69-42, dated August 12, 1969, which transmitted Departmental

Memorandum Number 635 of July 17, 1969, and attached Equal

Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations, which have been replaced

by Departmental Order 1713.4. Consistent with the provisions of the

EEO regulations, Assistant Special Agents in Charge and Number One

Men to Assistant Directors were designated to be Equal Employment

Opportunity Counselors for their respective divisions.

In order to comply with Civil Service Commission guidelines

further defining the sclcotion criteria for EHO Counselors, Special

Agents in Charge and Assistant Directors are instructed to designate

one employee to act as EEO Counselor in addition to the Assistant

Special Agent in Charge or Number One Man to the Assistant Director.

While the sensitive nature of the duties involved requires the assign- -

ment of a very responsible individual, employees selected to perform

this function should not be members of the office or division supervisory

'staff. The role of the counselor continues to be very significant in

processing complaints of discrimination and Special Agents in Charge

and Assistant Directors should review the counselor's responsibilities

as set forth in Chapter 3 of Departmental Order 1713-4 and the Manual

of Rules and Regulations, Part I, Section 10 G, 3 and 4, prior to

selecting an employee to perform this function. The identities of those

selected should be submitted to FBIHQ for approval on a UACB basis

by November 25, 1974. Although current EEO Counselors have been

exposed to the workings of the discrimination complaint process,

provisions will be made for formal training of all counselors at a later

date. Meanwhile, employees so designated should also be instructed to

familiarize themselves with the role of the counselor in the complaint

processing regulations. Once the selection is approved,the employee's

identity must be included along with that of the ASAC or Number One

Man, on the poster captioned "Federal Policy Is Equal Opportunity"

located on key bulletin boards.

(F) CLASSIFICATION AND DECLASSIFICATION OF NATIONAL

SECURITY INFORMATION - EXECUTIVE ORDER 11652 --

Attention is directed to Revision 269 of the Manual of

Rules and Regulations dated October 29, 1974, Part II, Section 4, which

includes in pages 53 - 57B, a completely revamped and expanded set of

instructions relative to the classification and declassification of national-

security data. This portion of the Manual now represents a comprehen-

sive statement of existing Bureau policies and procedures in this area,

including the requirements relative to the classification of intra-Bureau

material which was initiated on May 1, 1974.

During recent months FBIHQ has noted several undesirable

trends in the implementation of classification rules by the field, including

a number of procedural errors on the part of various offices. Chief

among these have been the following:

1. A tendency to overclassify material or to assign a higher

ciassification level than necossary. Information should not be classified

to protect sources unless it is worded in such a manner that disclosure

would tend to jeopardize the particular source involved. If it could have

originated with a variety of sources, classification should ordinarily not

be used. Informant symbol numbers as such do not warrant classification.

The "Confidential" category should suffice for the vast majority of FBI

data regarding classification. The "Secret"' level is to be applied on a

selective basis and only where serious damage to national security could

result such as the disruption of foreign relations significantly affecting

national security or the disclosure of important intelligence operations.

Some offices have adopted the practice of classifying most foreign

intelligence matters at the "Secret" level irrespective of the significance

of the case or the importance of informants utilized. This is undesirable

and should be corrected.

2. Failure to include justification statement when basis for

classification not clear and self-evident. A justification statement is

necessary, for example, whenever a communication contains informa-

tion attributed to two or more confidential sources.

3. Failure to mark individual paragraphs or sections of a report

or letterhead memorandum as to classification level. The rule is that

individual paragraph markings should be included wherever this can be

done conveniently and without time-consuming delay. It would appear that

this could be easily done with regard to the vast majority of communica-

tions reporting on current investigations.

You should review the foregoing matters with appropriate super-

visory personnel and insure that all employees who have occasion to

prepare classified communications are thoroughly familiar with the revised

provisions of the Manual of Rules and Regulations covering this area.

(E) COPYRIGHT MATTER -- SAC Letter 72-22, (B), dated 4/25/72,

brought attention to the fact that as a result of the passage of Public

Law 92-140, signed by the President 10-15-71, and providing for

creation of a limited copyright for sound recordings (records or tapes),

the Copyright Office, Arlington, Virginia, had advised the Alexandria

Office that a time lag of-2-to-6-months existed at that time between -

receipt of a copyright application or a letter containing either notice

of use or intention to use copyright material, and the actual preparation

and indexing of a file card advising that same has been received.

The above time lag has become a source of difficulty in

adequately handling on a timely basis the requests received by the

Alexandria Office from other field offices. In addition, because of this

time lag factor, many Agent man-hours are lost in handling repeat

searches of the same titles.

In an attempt to overcome this situation which exists at the

Copyright Office and to prevent unnecessary expenditure of Agent man-

hours in making repeat searches of records, the following instructions

are being instituted:

in the investigation of a Copyright Matter, the field office

receiving the complaint should attempt to determine the actual producer

of the bona fide version of the tape or recording involved and then set out

a lead for the office covering the home office of that company to determine

the copyright status of the sound recording. If a copyright is, in fact,

held by that company, the company should be able to supply the copyright

date and number from its company records. It should be noted that

copyrights granted sound recordings are prefixed by the letter "N." Sub-

sequently, verification could be made at the U. S. Copyright Office,

Arlington, Virginia, by setting out a lead for the Alexandria Office.

Ad-

ditionally, since Public Law 92-140 provides as criteria for violation of

the sound recordings section that "only those sound recordings fixed and

published on or after ?-15-72, are eligible for registration, " verification

of the exact date the recording in question was fixed could be established

from the home office of that company. A sound recording is "fixed" when

the complete series of sounds constituting the work is first produced on

a final master recording that is later reproduced in published copies.

Hencetorth, it will be incumbent upon the office of origin

in Copyright Matter cases to contact a reputable tape and record dealer

in an effort to determine whether the allegedly illegal duplications are

in fact duplications of recordings fixed after 2-15-72. Most record

dealers have access to catalogs which provide basic information of this

nature. Astute selection of recordings with prosecutive merit should

be made to preclude investigative expenditure of Agent man-hours in

be first searched by an Agent when their use is discontinued. At the

time property is declared surplus and transferred to another agency

it should be searched by the property clerk, even though it has been

locked and/or otherwise sealed in the interim between original search

and disposal.

organizations that should not be classified as revolutionary, subversive

or extremist. This particularly occurs in communications containing

information on demonstrations or other types of protest activity

sponsored by groups which do not have revolutionary or subversive

backgrounds. Information relating to protests by legitimate organizations

in pursuance of their constitutional rights should not carry an Internal

Security, Revolutionary Activity or other character implying that the

FBI considers the groups to be a threat to the internal security or of a

revolutionary nature. Bearing in mind that the FBI has no interest

in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate dissent, where

it is deemed necessary to report on activities of such groups, communi-

cations should bear the character "Miscellaneous - Information Con-

cerning" foliowed by the pareuthetical insertion i the interested Buroa

division or section (see Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section

4, Item 14, page 3).

The above instructions are not intended to relieve you of the .

obligation of being aware of activity scheduled to take place in your

territory where the possibility of civil disorder may occur as a result

of disruptive elements. This type of activity should be followed through

public and established sources to develop any possible violations of Title

18, U. S. Code, Sections 231, 2101, 2383 or 2384 or any other statutes

over which the Bureau has investigative responsibility. In the event

a potential for violence develops, the Bureau should be promptly advised.

Any violation of Federal statutes should, of course, be submitted under

appropriate caption.

This should be brought to the attention of supervisory and

investigative personnel handling these matters to assure that current

Bureau instructions are being followed.

IN RESPONSE TO SUBPOENAS OR DEMANDS OF COURTS OR OTHER

AUTHORITIES - ATTORNEY GENERAL ORDER NO. 501-73 -- Recent

communications submitted pursuant to SAC Memoranda 8-73 (C) and

9-73 (B) have followed a trend of using language such as "The United

testify or produce material and he was advised of facts in the case. The

United States Attorney offered no objections to Agents testifying. Agents

will testify UACB."

specify that the Unitod States Attorney or Assistant United States Attorney

advised you the testimony, production, or disclosure was approved or

was not approved. The Attorney General's order places the burden on

the United States Attorney to obtain such approval from the appropriate

official.

Your responsibility in these matters was stated in SAC

Memorandum 9-73 (B).

For your information, where the subpoena or demand

arises in a Federal case, the Government attorney in charge of the

litigation has been delegated authority to reveal and furnish such

material and relevant documents or information secured by the FBI

as he deems necessary or desirable in the litigation. However; this

authority has specific limitations which are described in the Manual

encourage employees to accrue as much sick leave as they can and to

keep annual leave in reserve for emergencies.so that situations

necessitating requests for IWOP will be kept to a minimum. Appropriate

manual revisions will be prepared.

(C) HOBBS ACT -- The Criminal Division of the Department has advised

preliminary review of recent decision of U. S. Supreme Court in Hobbs

Act case of United States v. Enmons, et al., indicates such decision

rules against applicability of Hobbs Act to allegations of violence by union

in labor strike when the objective of union is to obtain legitimate labor

goals for existing employees such as increase of wages, however, this

decision does not rule against application of Hobbs Act to alleged violence

by union when illegitimate labor demands made such as payment for

total wages of additional employees who are unwanted and unneeded.

Results of this review will be sent to all U. S. Attorneys (USAs) in order

that they can make determinations with respect to applicability of Hobbs

Act concerning allegations received by Bureau relative to violence in

union strikes.

Complete analysis of foregoing decision of Supreme

Court being made by Department with view to determining whether such

decision will have any further effect on Bureau investigations.

Any complaints received by field offices regarding violence

in-union strikes should be discussed immediately with USAs in accordance

with foregoing and Bureau should be advised promptly. Likewise, any

pending Hobbs Act investigations concerning violence in union strikes

should be discussed immediately with USAs and Bureau should be advised.

In event USAs are not cognizant of mentioned Supreme Court decision, -

it should be suggested USAs may wish to confer with Criminal Division

of Department.

dated 5/4/71 and airtel to SAC, Albany, copy sent to all divisions,

dated 6/30/71 captioned "Informant Designations - Security of Resident

Agencies," instructed, among other things, that when it is necessary

to get out the identity of an informant or source or any background -

information such as address, residence, etc., which would in itself

tend to compromise the informant or source, such information must

be sent by secure teletype (usually a nitel).

•As a result of review of progress/justification letters

(FD-401) at FBI Headquarters, it was determined that some divisions

have not been complying with the above instructions. In particular,

the position of an informant in a subversive organization should not be

set out if it would easily pinpoint his identity. This type of information

should be separately submitted by secure teletype. However, these

instructions in no way lessen your obligation to submit an adequate

progress/justification letter. This matter should be called to the

attention of all Special Agents handling security and extremist inior-

mants and sources.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

April 24, 1973

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY-PLAN OF ACTION FOR

1973 -- Reference is made to SAC Letter 72-18 (B) dated, March 28,

1972, which enclosed a copy of thé Bureau's Plan of Action for 1972.

There is enclosed a copy of the Bureau's Plan of Action for 1973, which

replaces that for 1972.

You should carefully review the Plan and insure

it is applied. You will be furnished additional copies of the Plan separately

and copies should be made available to employees and the public upon

request.

Your attention is directed to Objective Number 73-2, Item A,

which specifically states that the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity

Affairs will maintain statistical data on the accomplishments of field

offices with respect to the number of minority individuals recruited for

all positions ana women ior the position of Speciai agent, as wei às tue

number of minority employees and female Special Agents working in

each office: While it is recognized that assignments of Special Agents

are decided at FBIHQ, Special Agents in Charge will be expected to

insure that representative numbers of minority group employees are

-

included on the clerical staffs of their offices. Additionally, although

not specifically mentioned in this year's Plan, Special Agents in Charge

will be expected to continue to utilize minority Special Agents in

recruitment activity. Also where practicable, continue to give

consideration to utilizing minority clerical employees in connection

with radio and television broadcasts. This is fully consistent with the

Bureau's positive Equal Employment Opportunity Program which is set

out in detail in Part I, Section 10, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

I want to make it completely clear that although we have no

numerical goals as such for the recruitment of minorities, the Bureau

does have a continuing basic goal to sustain a steady and substantial

increase of empioyees representing all minorities in all assignments

throughout the service. As an organization representing all Americans.

the Bureau should be as representative of the American public as

possible.

measures such as letter bombs.

In view of this information, immediate steps should be

taken to strengthen security regarding publication of home addresses

and home telephone numbers of our personnel and the identification of

our employees as members of the FBI. All investigative personnel

should be encouraged to obtain unlisted telephone numbers. All Agents

assigned to investigations involving Al Fatah members or sympathizers

should be furnished full details, including descriptive material,

concerning letter bombs so that they may properly caution other

members of their families w.1) might receive mail at their residences.

All personnel, particularly tise in switchboard and information-type

assignments, should have reiterated to them the proper procedures

for answering inquiries concerning employees. It should be made

clear. to all employees that residence addresses or other personal

data should not be divulged and any inquiries for same should be

routed through supervisory personnel for appropriate evaluation.

There follows the Bureau's Plan of Action for 1973 with

regional adaptations. It is designed to supplement our everall program

and to emphasize to all employees at every level in our organization what

the Bureau is focusing on in particular in the Equal Employment Opportunity

Program this year. The Plan is responsive to the overall Plan of Action

published by the Department of Justice and fulfills the requirement for

regional plans as called for by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of

1972. The objectives are identical for all four regions with the exception

of Objective 73-2 which target: particular minorities in accordance with

regional population patterns.

The effectiveness of the Plan depends on the

wholehearted support of everyóne. The Plan sets fortn certain specific

supervisory responsibility which Division Heads and officials in charge

Inust insure is applied. This Plan should be a topic during the discussion

of Equal Employment Opporturity in conferences as called for by the

--

Manual of Rules and Regulations.

OBJECTIVE NUMBER 73-1: ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION

A. The Equal Employment Coportunity Officer, Personnel Officer and

officials in charge of FBIHQ and field divisions will insure that all

employees are aware of the FBI's commitment to Equal Employment

Opportunity.

Target Date - Continuing

B. The Director will assign at least one full-time employee to the

development of positive EEO programs.

Target Date - 1/1/73

C. Management Training and Executive Development Training sessions

for supervisory personnel will include information advising them of

OBJECTIVE NUMBER 73-2: TO INSURE AND SUSTAIN RECRUITMENT

ACTIVITY DESIGNED TO REACH AND ATTRACT MINORITY CANDIDATES

FROM ALL LOGICAL AND PRODUCTIVE SOURCES

FBIHQ Responsibility:

A. The Office of Equal Employment Opportunity Affairs will maintain

statistical data on the accomplishments of field offices with respect to

the number of minority individuals recruited for all positions and women

recruited for the position of Special Agent during a given period and

the number of minority employees and female Special Agents working

in each office. In each region particular attention will be paid to the

minority group classification of employees entering on duty as compared

to the numbers in which they are concentrated in that area.

Target Date - Beginning 1/30/73

B. Office of Equal Employment Opportunities Affairs representatives visit

field offices, assess programs and efforts directed toward recruitment

of minorities and women and meet with influential minority community

leaders and women to demonstrate the sincerity of the FBI in desiring

to attract more minorities and women to our service, and secure sug-

gestions. These visits by OFEOA representatives hopefully will provide

a basis for follow up by field offices with influential minority community

leaders and women who may be in a position to assist our efforts.

Officials in charge of field offices must fully realize, however, that the

actual recruiting responsibility still lies with the field offices and any

activities by OEEOA representatives are only a supplement to field

office recruitment programs.

-Target Date - Beginning 1/30/73

groups set forth in the Manual of Rules and Regulations. However, it

Due to the mobility of today's society there is increased likeli-

hood of attracting minority individuals from areas in which they are not

concentrated in significant numbers. This is particularly true as concerns

those individuals having qualifications for the Special Agent position as

evidenced by a number of employees drawn to our rolls from such areas.

(B) CLASSIFICATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION -

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11652 -- Bureau has followed practice of classifying

letterhead memoranda and reports which disclose an interest in a foreign

diplomatic official or establishment. This is based on presumption that

unauthorized disclosure of this type-data would-damage-U.S: relations

with country concerned. The following instructions are aimed at

establishing uniform policy in this regard: Letterhead memoranda or

reports should be classified if they disclose FBI interest in foreign

diplomatic officials or establishments, foreign government employees,

foreign exchange participants, or officials and/or employees of inter-

national organizations. This applies even though communications do not

specifically reveal an investigative interest, but do disclose that the FBI

is collecting information on a foreign official, establishment, et cetera,

e.g., a transmittal letter or form which contains no substantive infor-

mation but does show the title nd character of a case (i.e., "Soviet

Mission to United Nations").

Under ordinary circumstances such communications should be

exempted from automatic declassification, exemption category (3), i.e.,

information relating to disclosure of a foreign relations matter. How-

ever, in those cases where a communication is classified both on the

--

grounds that it discloses an interest in a foreign official, establishment.

et cetera, and tends to disclose intelligence sources or methods,

category (2), both applicable exemption categories should be shown,

i.e., (2) (3).

Communications which are classified to protect our interest

in foreign officials, establishments, et cetera, should be classified

CONFIDENTIAL unless the sabject matter involved merits a higher

classification.

This matter should be brought to the attention of interested

Agent and clerical personnel. Advise FBIHQ, attention Document

Classification Officer, if you have any questions.

(C) VISITORS TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA - In order

to more effectively fulfill our counterintelligence responsibilities

in the Chinese investigative field and based on the volume of cases

currently under investigation and the manpower available to handle these

investigations, you should immediately utilize the following guidelines

concerning investigations of visitors to the People's Republic of China-

(PRC):

Unless information is contained in field office files dictating

otherwise, you should institute active investigation concerning only those

males of Chinese descent between the ages of 25 and 55 at the time of their

visit to the PRC. These persons should be assessed as both a security

risk and for source potential to be utilized against the PRC.

Regardless of age, sex, and ethnic background, individuals

whose occupations and professions would make them attractive to PRC

intelligence should be investigated and assessed for source potential

to be utilized against the PRC. These should include, but not necessarily

be limited to, engineers, medical doctor's and individuals with advanced

degrees in the field of science, including professors. Bureau authority

must be obtained prior to instituting investigations of professors at

-

educational institutions.

During the course of the investigation, determine employmert

and whether subject has access to classified and/or sensitive intormation

and determine status of health, along with indicators of his potential

and amenability to being activated as a source or double agent against

the PRC.

Effective immediately SACs may authorize interviews of

travelers to the PRC unless significant derogatory information exists,

you desire to conduct the interview prior to subject's travel, or the

individual falls in categories outlined in Section 105 A, Item 6, Manual

of Instructions.

These interviews must be conducted in a fashion which

will not jeopardize sensitive Legat, Hong Kong, sources providing

information regarding travel to the PRC.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A) EXTREMIST INFORMANT PROGRAM =- affective immediately

changes in the Extremist Informant Program as set out below are to

be implemented.

The revised Extremist Informant Program eliminates

the uxban (ghetto) informant category and will now be limited to the

following three categories:

(a) potential extremist informant (PEI)

(b) extremist informant (EI)

(c) confidential source-extremist (CS-E)

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PEI is an individual who is in a position to furnish in-

formation concerning extremist activities of individuals and organizations.

A PEI should also be utilized to furnish information of an extremist

nature in those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to designate

'and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions as noted below. These

informants are to be operated for a period of not more than one year and

not less than six months providing their potential is such that it aopears

they will qualify for elevation to II. The PEI must be discontinued im-

mediately following a determination that he has no future potential as

an EI.

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority for

granting the approval of the operation of a PEl. If any of the following

conditions exist, the SAC must obtain authority from FBIHQ prior to

operating any individual as a PEI:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news media,

educational field or any other fieid where disclosure as an informant

could cause concern to the Bureau).

7/31/73

MEMORANDUM 31-73

NW 55041 DocId 32989525. Page 445

---

## Page 446

2. Any individual contemplating membership in, being

considered for membership in, or presently in an extremist organization.

3. Any individual who has been charged with a felony

violation in the past five years.

-4... Any.individual-who is presently_under_-indictment.or:

is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet who is

in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information not available from

other sources.

The SAC has authority to authorize payments to PEIs in

the amount of up to $400. Additional payment authority must be obtained

from FBI Headquarters.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to an EI.

The field recommendation must contain full justification. I PEI does

not qualify as an El within one year, he is to be discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An El is an individual who has been operated as a PEI for

at least six months (in order that his reliability can be properly evaluated)

and is furnishing extremist information on a regular basis whether it be

concerning an extremist organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In

order to elevate a PEI to an El, he must have produced authentic data

on extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate with the

Bureau by furnishing extremist information coming to his attention by

virtue of his position in the community, by his employment, or in view

of his background. This individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the Bureau. Prior

to operating anyone as a CS-E, advise FBI Headquarters of the individual's

identity and the type of information he is to furnish on a UACB basis.

MEMORAND UNI 31-73

CS-Es are not to be kept in a pending status unless they

are furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting in-

frequently may be operated from a pending file vith a provision for

closing aiter a fixed period of inactivity, out of a dead file or out of a

control file. Each SAC should determine which method of operation

is best suited for his individual needs. You may also desire to establish

an informant map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical

area within your division.

You are instructed to carefully evaluate each of your

urban (ghetto) informants to determine if they should be considered for

redesignation as Els, PEIs, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal

Informant Programs, or discontinued altogether. This should be

handled promptly and be completed within sixty days of receipt of this

communication.

Under the revised program no individual is to be operated

as an El or a PEl solely because he is in a "lisiening post' position.

It is your responsibility to insure that there is informant coverage in

those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence. Alert

all Special Agent personnel to the need for deveioping information where

there is a potential for violence. Instruct those Special Agents not

directly involved with extremist matters to refer those individuals who

, may possess information of potential violence to the Extremist

Supervisor in order that the informant potential of these individuals may

be assessed.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs or elevated

as Els.

Appropriate Manual changes follow.

FEDEKAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

BASHINGTON. D.C. 20535

November 28, 1973

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ROLE OF THE FBI LABORATORY --

As I have had the occasion to personally inform many of you, I am

firmly committed to the management practice which insures that our top

field, as well as Headquarters, oificials be fully cognizant of important and

significant matters which affect the Bureau. In keeping with this, you will be

informed, on a periodic basis, of matters discussed at the Executives

Conference meetings held at Headquarters, attended by the Assistant Directors

and other top Headquarters officials.

Such a meeting was held November 27,

1973, and a topic was discussed which I thought would be of interest to all

of you.

Bureau Headquarters recently conducied a survey ut the local crimo

laboratories throughout the United States.

Much of the information derived

was obtained with the assistance of the field. It was determined that there are

presently 180 local laboratories operated for law enforcement purposes,

staffed by approximately 3.000 criminalists. While a number of the labora-

tories are of considerable size, the majority are relatively small and our

initial survey developed that they have a great need for training to improve

• their technical proticiency.

As a result of this survey, the Bureau decided to host a symposium

on crime laboratory development, financially assisted by the Law Enforce-

ment Assistance Administration.

This is being held at the FBI Academy at

Quantico, Virginia, from December 3 to 6, 19%5, and you are being separately

furnished information relative to publicity on this symposium. This occasion

will bring togother representatives from many of these laboratories throughout

the country to determine how the FBI can best assist them in doing a better job.

We must recognize that regional laboratories will proliferate because

of the needs of local law enforcement in improving technology, and it will be

necessary for le Bureau, in meeting the needs of these regional laboratories,

MEMORANDUM 53-73

11/28/73

NN 55941

- DocId: 32989525 Page 448

to adjust its position accordingly. Because of the reputation of the FBI

Laboratory, and the professional standing of its stait, the Bureau is ir

an excellent position, through providing training, consultation and research

support, to retain its preeminence in the forensic field.

It is anticipated that some reorganization of the FBI Laboratory

will be undertaken to make available those qualified to provide instruction

to local laboratory personnel and thereby make them better qualified in

their chosen field. We are also exploring the possibility of obtaining

fellowships which will assist such individuals in defraying the necessary

costs of such schooling at Bureau Headquarters.

I thought you would be interested in the foregoing information, and

I would welcome any constructive suggestions you might have for improving

the Bureau's activities in this area.

(D) ARMED SPECIAL AGENTS ON BOARD AIRCRAFT - CRIMES

ABOARD AIRCRAFT - Recent instances have been reported wherein

Bureau Agents on official business traveling by air upon boarding com-

mercial flights have been requested by the pilot to surrender their

weapons and/or cartridges to the custody of the pilot until the Agent

arrives at his destination. Agents are not to surrender their weapons

upon request to flight captains.

Pilots making a request of this nature are in direct opposition

with provisions in Title 49, U. S. Code, Section 1412, and Federai

Aviation Administration regulation in Air Security Bulletin 71-1,

paragraph 6b. A copy of the Federal Aviation Administration Bulletin

was previously furnished as an enclosure to SAC Letter 71-11 (C) en- -

titled "Crime Aboard Aircraft - Safety of Passengers and Crew."

To preclude similar incidents from occurring, the Special

'Agent in Charge, or in his absence the Assistant Special Agent in

Charge, in field divisions wherein the home office of a major U. S.

commercial carrier is located is contacting the appropriate executive

airline official, higher than the carrier's security officer, to advise

him of the FBI Agents' authority to be armed while on official business

and traveling via air transportation. Promptly advise the Bureau of

difficulties stemming from Agents being armed traveling by air carrier

on official business.

Peace Action Coalition (NPAC) National Convention, 12/3-5/71,

Cleveland, Ohio; IS - C (Trotskyist)," which set forth procedure for

reporting coverage of NPAC National Convention.

Based on analysis of the results of this reporting procedure,

I am authorizing permanent implementation of this procedure for cover-

age of future national conventions and conferences of subversive

organizations. In addition, consideration will be given to implementing

this procedure, on select basis and subject to Bureau approval, for

large steering committee meetings and other leadership meetings of

subversivé organizations at which attendance of several informants has

been authorized.

For ready reference purposes, reporting procedure is as

follows:

1. Each informant will be instructed to maintain close

telephonic contact, consistent with security, with host office to report

significant information as developed;

2. Host office will submit daily teletype summary during

convention to reach Bureau prior to 5 a.m. following day and will sub-

mit additional teletypes, as appropriate, to report particularly

significant developments;

3. Upon return of informant to respective field office ter-

ritory, he will be immediately contacted, consistent with security, and

interviewed in depth concerning convention, with any particularly signi-

ficant information not previously furnished to host office submitted

immediately to Bureau and other interested offices by teletype suitable

for dissemination;

4. Without fail, within five days after informant's return,

field office will prepare detailed informant report using FD-306 and

send copy, together with copies of any literature obtained by informant

during convention, under airtel cover to host office only;

and extremist informants, and confidential and panel sources, is no

longer a required investigative step to obtain background data. Bureau

has determined that identifying information supplied by credit agencies,

to which field has been limited, is generally in possession of field at

outset of these investigations.

Accordingly, since such checks often

represent a needless expense, they should be made only when deemed

necessary because of developments in individual instances.

Manual and Handbook changes follow.

The following is the Firearms and Defensive Tactics Training Program for

the 1972 calendar year. There will be four indoor firearms training sessions to be

given in January, February, October, and November, To insure regular and periodic

training, each Special Agent in Charge should schedule the four outdoor training

3. ' The following two changes will be made in the Tactical Revolver Course:

Upon completion of the first 36 rounds the shooters will load

with six rounds at the 25-yard line and holster. On command he

will move to the 15-yard line, draw, and fire 12 shots in 30 seconds.

This 30-second time limit includes moving from the 25-yard line to

the 15-yard line.

Upon completion of the point shoulder firing at the 15-yard

line the shooters will load with six rounds and holster. On command

he will move to the seven-yard line, draw, and fire 12 shots in 25

seconds. As in the above case, the 25-second time limit includes

moving from the 15-yard line to the seven-yard line.

Position Shooting

Position shooting is scheduled for the first three outdoor training periods prior

to shooting the Practical Pistol Course (PPC) or the 'Tactical Revolver Course (TRC).

The shooting should be from the 50-yard line for the PPC and consist of 10 rounds in

each position, prone, sitting, weak-hand barricade, and strong-hand barricade. For

the TRC-position-shooting, 36-rounds-wilt be fired from the 25-yard line, 12-rounds in

each position, kneeling right hand, kueeling left hand, and point shoulder. Targets

should be scored and pasted after each 10- or 12-round phase. There is no qualifying

score and scores should not be recorded on the Agent's FD-40.

Practical Pistol Course (PPC)

During the 1st and 3rd training periods, Agents will be permitted to fire the

PPC either singie- or double-action at the 60- and 50-yarc lines. The remainder of

the course will be fired double-action.

Instructors should refer to Training Document #7, pages 118-143, relative to

this course.

*hotgun Courses

Prior to the firing of any shotgun course, each Agent will receive instruction

in the safe and proper method of unloading either the Model 870 or the Model 31

shotgun, depending on which weapon is to be used.

To properly unload the Model 870 shotgun, each Agent will, with the safety o2,

depress the action release; pull the foregrip toward the rear until the front end of the

shell from the barrel is even with the front end of the ejection port; then lift the front

end of the shell from the receiver. (The action must be opened slowly to avoid

releasing the next shell from the magazine.) Press up on the shell carrier, place

hand under the receiver and pull foregrip fully to the rear which will drop the first

shell from the magazine. Leaving the action fully open, depress the right shell stop

which releases the second shell from the magazine. Repeat until the magazine is empty.

To properly unload the Model 31 shotgun, each Agent will, with the safety on,

depress the left shell stop which releases the first shell from the magazine. Repeal:

until the magazine is empty. Depress the action release, then pull he foregrip toward

the rear until the shell from the barrel is ejected.

Alter unloading either shotgun, the Agent should look through the ejection port

to insure there is no snell in the barrel or the magazine.

Shotgun Course #1

Shotgun Course #1 will be fired during the ist outdoor shoot. Ten points are

scored for each hit and a qualifying score is 60. Scores are to be recorded on each

Agent's FD-40. (See Training Document #30, pages 31-44.)

Shotgun Course #2

Shotgun Course #2 will be fired during the 2nd and 4th outdoor shoots. There

is no qualification; however, the scores should be posted on the Agent's FD-40.

(See Training Document #30, pages 45-69:)

Shotgun Course #3

Shotgun Course #3 will be fired during the 3rd outdoor shoot. The course

consists of firing five rifled slugs from the 50-yard line at an Army "E" (bobber)

target.

Only one round is to be loaded in the shotgun and the weapon reloaded after

each shot. The first two ritled slugs are fired from a standing position. Upon

• completion of the second shot, the shooter, with the action open and safety on, drops

to the strong knee and reloads one round.

The remaining three slugs are fired from

this kneeling position with stress being on the proper loading and handling of the

weapon. Each hit has a value of 20 and a qualifying score is 60. The score should

be entered on the Agent's FD-40.

--

Rifle Course

The Rifle Course will be fired during the ist and 3rd outdoor shoots using the

• Model 760, ,308 caliber Remington rifles and carbines. Plastic training ammunition

is to be used. The course will consist of firing 10 rounds, four rounds prone, four

rounds kneeling, and two rounds off-hand, from the 50-yard line at an Array "L"

(bull's-eye) target. The shots will be fired "slow fire." The point of aim should be

the center of the bull's-eye.. Scores should be posted on the Agent's FD-40.

Qualifying score is 60.

Technique and Use of the Blackjack

The blackjack is to be used only in self-defense. It is a matter of individual

preference where the blackjack is carried; however, it should be carried in the

same place at all times, in a place convenient to reach, and not exposed to public view.

-5-

NW 55041 .DocId: 32989525 Page 465

---

## Page 466

The blackjack may be held by grasping the handle with the thumb on top or

with the thumb overlapping the index finger. It may also be grasped using the regular

fist grasp on the weighted end. If there is a thong, it should not be wrapped around

the wrist, but rather, should be Icoped over the thumb or index finger and carried

across the back of the hand before grasping the butt of the blackjack. This grip will

secure the blackjack to the hand and also allow it to be released quickly if necessary.

Blows with the blackjack should be short and snappy, using mostly the wrist and

forearm. Roundhouse blows using the entire arm are not advisable because they are

slow, inaccurate, and it is difficult to regulate the force of the blow. When the

weighted end is grasped, short upward and sideward jabs with the tip of the blackjack

and orthodox fist blows are struck.

Effective blows can be struck on the various joints -- knuckles or back of hand,

wrist, elbow, shoulder, knee, and ankle; and on other vulnerable areas, such as:

the shin, collarbone, forearm, upper arm, thigh, kidney, pit of stomach, and solar

plexus.

Do not strike an individual on the head because: (1) fatal results might ensue;

(2) the head is easier to defend than otter vulnerable parts of the body; and (3) attempting

to strike an individual on the head places the blackjack and the hand and arm involved

in delivering the blow in a position ruinerable to a counterattack or disarming movement.

A suggested technique in handling the blackjack is to feint a blow to the head and then

_rike a joint (example: knee) or some other vulnerable area.

Gas Equipment

-

Training with the Bureau's gas equipment is scheduled for the 1st and 3rd out-

door shoots. Instructors should refer to Manual of Instructions, Volume I, Section 3,

Page 3, and Police Instructors' Bulletins on tear gas dated August 1, 1967, October 2,

1967, and November 13, 1968. The proper use of the aerosol tear gas dispensers

should be emphasized.

Each Agent should practice with his weak hand using the dis-

pensers with a bobber target used as targets at distances of five and ten feet.

Handcuffing, Searches, and Transporting Prisoners

During the 2nd and 4th outdoor shoots instructors should explain and demon-

strate the proper methods to apply handcufis, conduct searches, and transport

prisoners. Instructors shouid refer to Training Locument #72 entitled "Handcuffing"

and Training Document #48 on 'Searches of Persons." Instructors will insure each

Agent is proficient in the use of all restraining devices.

Reporting.

Each Special Agent in Charge must notify the Bureau, Attention: Training

Tivision, by July 31, 1972,

the results of both the ist and 2nd training periods.

The

cureau must also be notified by October 15, 1972, the results of both the 3rd and 1ti

training periods. The following information must be submitted:

Names of Agents who have missed the firearms and/or

defensive tactics training and have not made up the

training. The specific reasons for the delinquencies

should be indicated.

Make-up sessions should be scheduled at the completion of each regular

scheduled training period for those Agents who are unable to attend on their scheduled

days. No Agent should be permitted to become delinquent iwo consecutive training

periods except in cases of physical disability or in extreme emergencies. In-Service

training should be counted in lieu of one scheduled outdoor training period during the

year.

DEFENSIVE TACTICS .

A minimum of 60 minutes of each cutdoor firearms training period will he

devoted to practice in Defensive Tactics. This training should be scheduled during

the early part of the day rather than at the conclusion of firearms training. All

techniques must be practiced by each Agent.

1. All techniques must be first practiced in "slow action" and

speeded up only aiter the mechanics are thoroughly learned.

2. The Agent acting as the subject should offer only passive resistance

and give with pressure. Active resistance leads to injury and

impedes learning.

3. The Agent performing the techniques. should apply pressure

slowly and be extremely careful to simulate the striking of all

blows. This will allow the subject ample time to signal that he

is being hurt and the operator can stop before injury occurs.

4. Only the first phase of techniques involving a throw, trip,.

or take-down will be practiced.

5. In connection wich the practice of disarming methods, "dummy"

guns must be used.

There is a continuing need for a most serious approach to this training.

Accordingly, you are agein instructed to follow this program closely to make certain

that it is properly and effectively conducted. In addition, you should encourage

Agents to periodically rèview Bureau pamphlet entitled 'Defensive Tactics" so as to

maintain a working knowledge of all the techniques contained therein. During the

Is' and 3rd outdoor training periods, the following defensive tactics techniques

s) suld be covered:

Come-along holde

Disarming Methods

Defense Against Attack from the Front

Defense Against Attack from the Rear

The following defensive tactics techniques should be covered during the

2nd and 4th outdoor training periods:

Come-along holds

Disarming Methods

Defense Against Blows

Instructors should refer to the following outline as to the particular techniques

to be practiced. Page and figure references refer to Bureau pamphlet entitled

"Defensive Tactics."

--

1. Defense against attack from the rear.

A. Body locks - rear

1. Arms free (blows only) (Figures 36 and 37)

2. Arms pinned (blows only) (Figures 38, 39, and 40)

B. Rear strangle hold (Figures 66, 67, and 68).

Note: instructors should emphasize the application

of personal weapons to vulnerable areas

and the importance of body position.

including lowering the chin and turning the

head to side, in the situations indicated above.

WW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 468

## Page 469

The most logical blows to be used (Page 8)

should be demonstrated and then practiced

by the class; first, against an imaginary

adversary (combat speed) and secondly

against the subject (slow action). Subject

should attack from rear unannounced,

employing a body lock arms free, body lock

arms pinned, "or strangle hold.

2. Defense against attack from front.

A. Grasp on chest

1. Forearm to Forearm (Figures 29, 30, and 31)

B. Front strangle

°1. Two hands - windmill (Figures 48, 49, 50, and 51)

C. Defense against blows

1. Parry toward outside (Figures 91 and 92)

2. Parry toward inside (Figures 89 and 90)

NOTE: Class should parry blows as indicated

above and counter with a right-hand blow

to subject's midsection or other vulnerable areas.

3. Pertinent Police 'Techniques

A. Come-along holds

1. Arm and wrist (Figure 159) with "bent wrist, " (Figure 160)

"bent arm," (Figures 175, 176, 177, and 178)

"finger lock," (Figures 163, 164, and 165) and

"bar hammer lock"' (Figures 171, 172, 173, and 174).

NOTE: From position shown in Figure 159, upon

command of instructor, student will apply "bent

wrist" (Figure 160).

On command of instructor, subject will resist

by (1) pulling elbow downward -- student will

apply "pent arm" (Figures 175, 176, 177, and 178) -

(2) pulling elbow upward - student applies a "bar

hammer lock"' (Figures 171 and 172), by striking

"heel-of-hand" blow to rear of elbow (Figures 173

and 174). •

Students should also practice shifting grasp from

wrist to two middle fingers prior to the time

subject resists so as to be in a position to apply

a "finger lock" (Figure 163) if and when he does

offer resistance.

B. Out of Automobile

1. Reverse wrist lock, thumb and forefinger.

(Figures 233,

234, 235, 236, and 237)

4. Disarming Methods

NOTE: Instructor should state the purnose for

Disarming Methods (pages74 and 75)

A. Preliminary movements

1. Right hand - Figures 287, 288, and 289

2. Left hand - Figure 290

NOTE: Have subject try to move gun slightly

as soon as he sees the student move.

This procedure will afford the student

the opportunity of appraising his ability

along these lines.

B. Right hand - sling across body

(Figures.291, 292, 293, ard 294).

C. Left hand on wrist (or gun) - up toward shoulder -

twist (Figures 295, 296,

and 297).

D. Rear right turn - strike gun or arm forcefully

(Figures 306, 307, and 308).

Instructor should divide class into two lines. Line A should practice

techniques following commands given by instructor. When line A displays command

of a technique then line B should practice. By repeating the same technique at each

outdoor firearms training period, Agents will become more proficient; therefore,

less time would be devoted to demonstration and more time devoted to practice.

5. Defenses Against Knife

A. General Suggestions (page 30, G).

B. Downward Thrust.

1. Grasp and step across body (Figures 96, 97,

98, 99, and 100).

(C) TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTION --

The following instructive Federal decisions reported in

January, 1972, should be read by all Legal Instructors: U.S. v. Bailey,

332. F. Supp. 1351 (1971)(N. D. Ill.), grand jury may not compel one

who is witness, and possible defendant, to submit handwriting samples

without prior showing of reasonableness.

If samples properly compelled,

FBI experts may lawfully make handwriting examination in aid of grand

jury. U.S. v. Leta, 332 F. Supp. 1357 (1971)(M.D. Pa.), FBI wire-

tapping under Title III, 18 USC 2510, upheld. Seizure of some innocent

conversations does not require exclusion from evidence of incriminating

conversations seized. Decision shows basis for holding that wiretapping

is necessary because other investigative techniques are ineffective.

U.S. v. Cecere, 333 F. Supp. 124 (1971)(E.D. N. Y.), lawful occupant

of premises may consent to search thereof that is valid against person

allowed to store goods there as a convenience. See also U.S. v. Martinez

450 F2d 864 (1971)(8th Cir.); U.S. V. Novick, 450 F2d 1111 (1971)(Sth Cir.).

U.S. V. McClard, 333 F. Stup. 158 (1971)(E. D. Ark.), delay in execution

of search warrant for farm buildings ior six days because of inciement

weather predictably affecting success of search was reasonable. Further

delay of several hours on day of execution, to make sure all suspects

were in the barn, was reasonable. U.s. ex rel. Harden v. Hollette,

303 F. Supp. 371 (1970)(S. D. N. Y.), police show-up of lone suspect to

witness held unlawful. Little v.. Wainwright, 333 F. Supp. 466 (1971)

(M.D. Fla.), decision shows how facts discovered during permissible

stop for investigation, and recorded on field interrogation form, led to

probable cause for search of vehicle later found parked near saloon.

Dykes v. Camp, 333 F. Supp. 923 (1971)(E.D. Mo.), lawful arrest

of person in vehicle justifies protective frisk of subject's companion.

U.S. ex rel. Ellington y. Conjoy, 333 F. Supp. 1318 (1971)(S.D. N. Y.),

officer approached robbery suspect standing in group of persons in

• lobby of public building and accused suspect of the crime. Suspect made

an admission. Officer may testify to admission, without proof of

Miranda warnings; suspect was not in custody. LeDent v. Wolff,

334 F. Supp. 64 (1971)(D. Neb.), reliability of informant for search

warrant affidavit may be established by (1) extensive detail of his

information; (2) corroboration by police investigation; or (3) fact he

speaks against his own penal interest. U.S. V. Wright, 449 F2d 1355

(1971)(D.C. Cir.), stolen property that officer saw and recognized by

flashlight, was in plain view and subject to lawful seizure both then

and when he returned two hours later. U.S. V. Honore, 450 F2d 31

(1971) (9th Cir.), local officer searching premises under search warrant

for local offense found a carbine and a set of license plates, all wrapped

in a towel and not listed in his search warrant. Seizure approved. -

because he previously had learned from FBI that subject was suspected

of bank robbery. U.S. v. Kane, 450 E2d 77 (1971)(5th Cir.), FBI Agent

lawfully on gambling premises by search warrant, and who did not

impersonate the defendants, could testify to answering telephone and

taking b3 gambling calls during four hour period. U.S. v. Lopez, 450

F2d 169 (1971)(9th Cir.), valid Miranda, waiver also waives McNabb-

Mallory requirement of prompt appearance before Magistrate. U.S. v.

Sims, 450 F2d 261 (1971)(4th Cir.), anonymous telephone call to police,

describing allegedly armed man then in airport, shortly thereafter

corroborated by police view of person in airport meeting that description,

gave police lawful basis for immediate frisk, seizure of weapon found,

arrest for carrying weapon contrary to state law, and police station

search of attache case carried by subject. U.S. v. Sokolow, 450 F2d

324 (1971)(5th Cir.), officer arresting subject nea latter's garage, on

charge of stolen cigarettes, saw quantity of air conditioners in garage.

Officer had no evidence that air conditioners were stolen. His entry -

into garage to take serial numbers of air conditioners was an unreasonable

search. U.P: V. Marrero, 460 Ard 318 (1971/(2d Cir.), overnight

• lodging of defendant tor purpose of arraignment the next morning does

not violate the McNabb-Mallory Rule. See dictum on whether 18 USC

3501 affects that ruie.

Eisentrager v. Hocker, 450 F2d 490 (1971)

(9th Cir.), when landlady, acting without police instigation in any

form, entered tenant's apartment and found corpse of tenant's wife,

all evidence found by lancilady was admissible even assuming that

she was trespassing. U.S. ex rel. Brown v. Rundle, 450 F2d 517

• (1971)(5th Cir.), confession given while in custody will not be ruled

invalid merely because accused was only 16-years of age. Decision

shows value of log kept during interrogation. U.S. v. Sanchez, 450

F2d 525 (1971)(10th Cir.), brief detention for questioning under

suspicious circumstances, without arrest, is lawful. An informant

who informs against his own penal interest is considered reliable.

U.S. V. Catalano, 450 E2d 985 (1971)(7th Cir.), when three experienced

city police oificers saw known burglar outside of his neighborhood in the

early hours of the morning and driving a car containing tree passengers,

all of whom slouched below the car windows as it approacred the lighted

police car, the combination of these circumstances gave Lie ofticers a

lawful basis for a stop and temporary detention to investigate. U.S. v.

Harper, 450 F2d 1032 (1971)(5th Cir.), execution of search warrant for

premises may properly be delayed; during the statutory ten-day period,

to facilitate the search and the arrests planned as incidental thereto.

Evidence seized in delayed search will be excluded only if delay resulted

in legal prejudice to defendant. U.S. v. DeLarosa, 450 F2& 1057 (1971)

(3d Cir.), decision describes instructive problem in mairtaining chain

of custody for evidence found during "on-scene" investigation. U.S. v.

Kennedy,

450 F2d 1089 (1971)(9th Ciro), there is no constitutional right

to a lineup. U.S. v. Wilson, 451 F2d 209 (1971)(5th Cir.) use of body

recorder on informant, and evidence obtained thereby, upheld as

constitutional. Search warrant calling for seizure of "paraphernalia for

making coins" gave adequate description of things to be seized. U.S. v.

Drew, 451 F2d 230 (1971)(5th Cir.), city officers who legitimately

stopped subject for traffic violation had right in lonk inside the car while

talking to subject, and further right to seize opaque plastic package wnich

lay on right front floorboard and which had physical contours suggestive of

pistol inside. U.S. v. Knight, 451 E2d 275 (1971)(5th Cir.), when

performance of official duty requires an officer to enter upon private -

property, his conduct, otherwise a trespass, is justifiable. The

trespass does not of itself constitute an illegal search. That the

officer then saw in open view is lawfully seized. U.S. r. Glasgow,

451 F2d 557 (1971)(9th Cir.), Miranda rights may be waired without

signing waiver form. Interrogating officer's promise i advise court

and United States Attorney of subject's cooperation by coniessing

does not make the confession involuntary. U.S. V. Rcman. 451 E2d

579 (1971)(4th Cir•), decision shows text of approved FEi affidavit

for search warrant in auto theft case.

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - FBI FORM BOOK --

Under present procedure, the field submits an annual report on security

informants and sources advising which are paid regularly under Bureau

authority. This report lists subversive organizations, approximate

membership and coverage. The field also submits each quarter a

letter setting forth informant and source coverage, on college campuses.

A new form incorporating the above which is self-explanatory

quarterly by secure teletype (nitel) to replace these communications.

This quarterly communication will be submitted by the 10th of January,

April, July and October. This does not affect the submission of

quarterly reports concerning the New Left Movement and the monthly

report showing informants added and deleted.

Other self-explanatory forms are being prepared which will

require information be furnished on a monthly basis by secure teletype

concerning the number of informants, statistical accomplishments

and security informant accomplishments. All offices east of the

Mississippi will submit the monthly letter by the 3rd of the month and

all other offices will submit the monthly letter by the ith of the month.

These new procedures will not apply to extremist, white hate groups

or espionage matters.

(A) SELECTIVE SERVICE REGULATION CHANGES - PERSONNEL AND

RECRUITING MATTERS - National Selective Service Headquarters has-

advised of extensive changes in its regulations. Changes provide

additional new classifications as follows: 1-H: Registrant not currently

subject to processing for induction; 2-D: Registrant deferred because of

study preparing for the ministry; 4-G: Registrant exempted from service

during peace; 4-W: Conscientious objector who has completed alternate

service in lieu of induction. Classifications as follow have been revoked:

1-S: Student deferred by statute; 1-Y:

Registrant qualified for military

service only in time of war or national emergency (registrants with

temporary disqualifications subject to reexamination will be kept in

classification 1-A (available) until status resolved, those with other

than temporary disqualifications will be classified 4- F (not qualified));

5-A: Registrani even the age of liability for military service.

Other changes, in addition to ending college undergraduate

student (2-S) deferments for those who were not entitled to 2-S deferment

during the last quarter or semester of the 1970-1971 academic year,

include the following: Initial registration period extended to 60 days,

commencing 30 days before reaching of eighteenth birthday; registrants

to retain registration and classification cards only until the end of liability

for military service--age 25 for those never deferred and 35 for others;

only registrant may request exemptions, deferments, or postponements

from his local board; veterans now required to register only it not

registered prior to entry on active duty and they have not discharged

their military obligations; files of registrants over the age of 26 are to be

desiroyed except for doctors, allied medical personnel, and certain other

registrants, with only a record of prior classifications to be retained.

A processing ceiling cutoff is to be announced for registrants

subject to possible induction in 1972 and for the recently held 1973 lottery

with those above the ceiling to be reclassified 1~H and their files

inactivated. If at any future time the lottery number and priority group

of registrants classified 1-H should fall in the range of those being

-selected for induction, because of a national emergency, at that time

any claim for deferment could be presented for appropriate classification

with attendant procedural rights of appeal within 15 days (reduced from

30 days) of notice of reclassification. The Bureau will continue to

request of local draft boards, prior to expiration of occupational (2-A)

deferments, that our employees designated 2-A remain so classified

until notification has been received of reclassification to 1-H or that •

their active files have been destroyed. It will be necessary to include

with the Bureau's letter to the local draft board a request from the

individual employee that he remain in 2-A. Appropriate letter will be

furnished for signature of such employees.

Above changes should be carefully reviewed by all super-

visory and concerned investigative personnel. Ail male employees with

unfulfilled military obligations still subject to Selective Service regula-

tions are to be reminded of their obligation to keep their local draft

boards advised of pertinent address changes to insure any correspondence

emanating from their boards will reach them promptly; also, of standing

instructions to immediately advise the Bureau of any change in their drait

status, utilizing Form FD-295 (Selective Service - Reserve Status) unless

circumstances dictate more expeditious notification in which case the

form should be forwarded promptly thereafter. With the destruction of

active draft files for registrants age 26 or older, you should be alert

during investigations of male applicants age 26 or older to review the

record of prior classifications for any special classifications such as

1-A-O, 1-Y (revoked under current regulations), etc., and if revealed,

resolve fully with applicant furnishing pertinent data to Bureau expedi-

tiously. Manual changes will be furnished.

(B) BANK ROBBERY TRAINING FILM - Copies of a 16-millimeter,

20-minute, color film entitled "Holdup" are available for use by FBI

personnel in discussing bank robbery before banking personnel. The

film was prepared under the guidance of the Wells Fargo Bank, San

Francisco, for use in training its personnel in holdup matters.

This

film will be made available for use by Bureau representatives only;

it should not be requested for use by law enforcement personnel. The

film is not appropriate for use in police training schools as it was

produced from the banker's standpoint. It relates to plans which should

be instituted and training which should be given to bank employees

before a holdup occurs. In using the film, FBI representatives should

emphasize that it is an example ot a training aid used by a major bank

in training its employees regarding what to do before, during and

after a bank holdup. Our personnel should make it very clear that we

are not advertising or endorsir; Wells Fargo Bank or its policies or

practices in any nanner whatsnever, and that this film is shown

strictly for the purpose of possibly assisting banking institutions in

formulating their own procedures to thwart noiduys.

(E) LAWSUITS AGAINST THE FBI -- We are experiencing an ever-

increasing number of lawsuits designed to harass and disrupt FBI

operations and challenge FBI authority to investigate certain matters,

particularly in the security field. One such lawsuit was brought in

June, 1970, in U. S. District Court, Southern District of New York,

Sy The Filth Avenue Peace Parade Committee against the Director,

Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Office,

and The

Amalgamated Bank of New York (ABNY). This lawsuit charged that the

FBI harassed antiwar demonstrators in New York City during November,

1969, and that the ABNY gave information to the FBI without the

knowledge or consent of depositors and without a subpoena.

A Federal judge has held that the FBI indeed has authority

to gather intelligence information relating to demonstrations pursuant

to Title 28, U. S. Code, Section 533, and that the ABNY did not violate

plaintiffs' rights by releasing information to the FBI without a subpoena.

The suit against both the FBI and the ABNY was dismissed by the judge

who stated that plaintiffs had presented no evidence which proved their

rights had been violated.

During trial in this suit it became apparent that if our Agents

had deviated even slightly from existing Bureau instructions during the -

investigation, the legitimate purpose of the intelligence-gathering

investigation could have been exceeded and the rights of the demonstrators

abridged. For example, Agents openly carrying cameras in the immediate .

area of the demonstrators, interviewing demonstrators or drivers of

buses carrying demonstrators or, generally, being obtrusive could have

"chilled" the Constitutional rights of the demonstrators,

according to

the judge. In addition, judge ruled that dissemination of the results of

the investigation to agencies which would have no ostensible reason to

receive them would be an unconstitutional abridgment of demonstrators'

rights.

Each. Special Agent in Charge should insure that all

investigations in this most sensitive area are conducted with utmost

discretion and the results disseminated only to those agencies which

have legitimate need to receive them. You should also remain alert

for similar lawsuits, whether brought against the FBI or other law

enforcement agencies in your Division, and keep the Bureau fully.

advised of details, progress, and results.

Index (ADEX) extremist subjects for inclusion in the Stop Index File.

—In the future when proposing-such action, form ED-122 recommending

preparation of, or change in, an ADEX card for such a subject should

be submitted to the Bureau in triplicate. The succinct summary attached

to the FD-122 should contain a specific recommendation that the subject

be placed in the Stop Index File, as well as appropriate descriptive

data. Following approval of this recommendation at the Bureau, the third

copy of the FD-122 will be referred to the Voucher Statistical Section,

Computer Systems Division, which now maintains the Stop Index File

and one-half hours elapsed between arrest of juvenile at 7:30 a.m.

robbery, officers brought two handcuffed suspects to vicinity of wank -

where they were separately identified by two tellers without defense

counsel present. Third suspect similarly identified one and one-half

, hours after crime. These iientifications were proper. U.S. V. Medina,

452 E2d 1090 (1971)(3d Cir.,, prearrest identification of bank robber

by photo display, without counsel present, approved. U.S. v. Johnson,

452 F2d 1363 (1971)(D.C. Cir.), instructive decision on identification

by photograph. Also, when police had valid arrest warrant for armed

robber, searched defendant's home unsuccessiully to arrest him, and saw

pistol in closet where defendant could have been hiding, seizure of

search of the car without warrant was unlawiul. U.s. V. Rogers,

453

EZa 860 (1971) (9th CIr.), If thure is probable cause to arrest, it is

of no consequence that the search of the person immediately precedes

the arrest. U.S. v. Speaks, 153 F2d 965 (1972)(ist Cir.), where

officer explained prisoner's Miranda rights at length, and prisoner

history forms on instructions of officers who failed to tell him that

writing would be used for handwriting comparison. No prejudice of

reversible dimensions.. U.S. V. Shields, 453 F2d 1235 (1972)(Sth Cir.),

decision shows standards for lawial search of body cavity. U.S. v. Harris,

453 F2d 1317 (1972)(8th Cir.), taking handwriting exemplars is a

warned of right to refuse. If Miranda warnings were previously given,

these are sufficient to make consent voluntary. U.S. v. Furtney, 454

F2d.1 (1972)(3d Cir.), a lineup is not a constitutional requisite to

admission of a witness' in-court identification. U.S. v. Guinn, 454

F2d 29 (1972) (5th Cir.), although affidavit for search warrant must

speak-as of the time of issue, there is no arbitrary time limit on

how old the information in the affidavit may be. Wilson v. Gatiney,

454 F2d 142 (1972)(10th Cir.), at lineup a volunteer attorney may

serve in absence of subject's attorney retained or appointed.

Roderick v. Oregon, 454 E2d 214 (1972)(9th Cir.), where arresting

officers in Oregon had reliable information that felony warrant for

subject was outstanding in Idaho, their search of the vehicle of

arrest was justified for their own safety and the incriminating

weapon they found was properly seized.

(A) CRIMINAL FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS - SAC Letter 71-22 (A),

dated May 25, 1971, provides for all field offices to submit semiannual

reports to the Bureau concerning new criminal fraud matters (Fraud

Against the Government, Federal Housing Administration Matters,

and Veterans Administration Matters) if the total number of cases

received during a six-month period was less than the total number

during the same period of the prior year. Such reports were to be

submitted January 15 and July 15 of each year.

In view of the considerable rise in the number of criminal

fraud cases being received in the field, this program is being

discontinued and it will no longer be necessary for the field to submit

semiannual reports. Each cifice should, however, continue to make

a close check on the number (f violations received in these categories

to insure all such cases are being promptly reported and investigated.

(B) REPORTING OF PROTEST DEMONSTRATIONS -- The Bureau

has noted a trend toward incomplete and nonspecific reporting of

disruptive, anti-Government demonstrations and protest rallies. It

is often necessary to go back to the reporting office for pertinent

details concerning these disorders, which results in delayed -

dissemination. Details which have been neglected include failure to

report number of protesters present, identities of organizations,

and identities of speakers and leading activists.

The necessity for full and complete reporting must be

impressed on all personnel handling these matters. Existing

instructions require that communications reporting such incidents

are to be submitted under a substantive case caption with a brief,

accurate description of the event; for example, Students for a

Democratic Society - Demonstration Against ROTC, University of

Wisconsin, 4/25/72. Where multiple organizations are involved,

the group primarily responsible for organizing the demonstration

should be utilized in the caption.

When your original communication concerning a disruptive

demonstration does not contain all pertinent details, you should set

forth what steps you are taking to obtain this information. Make

certain that you submit recommendations for initiating investigation

of sponsoring organizations, if warranted, under criteria set forth

'in Section 87B, Manual of Instructions. For proper routing of

information at the Bureau continue to use code words "VIDEM"

(Vietnam Demonstration) and "STAG" (Student Agitation). Persons

arrested should be identified, since circumstances of an arrest, in

some cases, may indicate a propensity for violence. In considering

whether a security investigation of an individual is warranted, it.

should be noted that a mere arrest in connection with a demonstration

is insufficient basis in itself for investigation. The arrest must be

coupled with a demonstrated propensity for violence or with

subversive or revolutionary activity on the part of the individual

arrested.

The above guidelines are intended to reiterate and clarify

- - existing instructions and you must insure that in reporting these

matters you adhere to Bureau requirements.

(C) CONTACTS WITH THE PUBLIC - PROPER DEFINITION OF TERMS

INVESTIGATION AND SURVEILLANCE - In view of indications that

substantial segments of the public are confused concerning the proper

definition of the terms investigation and surveillance, as related to

Bureau operations, all Bureau speakers must remain particularly alert

to clearly and concisely convey the proper meaning of these terms

whenever it is necessary to mention them in connection with public

statements. Intra-Bureau understanding of the term surveillance means:

of course, a specific investigative technique selectively employed during

an investigation when individual circumstances warrant. Physical,

photographic, and electronic surveillances are included in this category

but such matters

should not normally be discussed, unless required to

correct an obvious misconception.

(D) ACCESS TO RECORDS MAINTAINED BY BANKING DSTITUTIONS --

The following legal analysis is being provided for guidance in responding

to inquiries concerning FBI access to records maintained by banking

institutions.

Bank records generally are available in response to the authority

of a Grand Jury subpoena or other appropriate order of a court. In the

absence of such authority, access to records won request may be approved

by the courts depending upon the nature of the investigation and the scope

of the request.

Generally, the case decisions have divided on the distinction.

between requests for information needed to establish the elements of a

criminal offense or to aid in discharging essential governmental

responsibilities and requests having no such basis. Access to records

based on a request in the first category has been approved due to the

reasorableness of the bank's response lo a public duty to disclose the

information. Requests of the latter type may be prompted by an agency's

desire simply to monitor the existence and degree of association of

individuals or groups. Such review of bank records for intelligence

gathering per se may be difficult, if not impossible, to defend against a

claim of First Amendment violation.

For example, in Pollard v. Roberts. 283 F. Supp. 248

(ED Ark. 1968), affirmed 393 U.s. 14, a prosecutor, conducting an

investigation of allegations of vote buying, sought access to the bank

account of the political group nained. The account data would have shown

not only payments made by drafts upon the account but also the amounts

of political contributions to the account and the identities of the contributors.

The court enjoined production of the account data except for the recorded

expenditures and expressed the opinion that the information regarding drafts

upon the account was appropriately available to the prosecutor looking into

alleged vote buying but that the other records of contributors' accounts were

protected by the First Amendment.

The theory at work here is that the right of people to associate

in groups to advocate and promote legitimate political, social or economic

action is protected even though such action may be controversial. If the

associated groups or their objectives are unpopular, revelation of the

6-13-72

MEMORANDUM 5-72

- 2 -

WW 55041-DocId:32989525 Page 493

---

## Page 494

identities of members may prorose reprisals from those opposed and fear

of such reprisals may discournge the free exercise of constitutional

rights. Therefore, government action which has the effect of impairing

enjoyment of the First Amendment is carefully limited by the courts.

The court noted that cisclosure of the bank records identifying

the contributors to a political association might be approved only where

there is a showing of a rational connection between the disclosure of such

information and a legitimate government end and that the government

interest is cogent and compelling. Moreover, even when disclosure would

be approved under such conditions, a sweeping and indiscriminate disclosure

in excess of the legitimate need would not be approved.

A similar result occurred in The Fifth Avenue Peace Parade

Committee, et al. V. J. Edgar Hoover, et al., 70 Civ. 2646, SDNY

(1972), (unreported) (appeal pending) where the plaintiffs sought an

injunction prohibiting access to account information in the absence of a

subpoena. The court dismissed the suit on the grounds that the government

interests were legitimate and that the plaintiffs had not shown any basis

for their claim that the information obtained from the bank intertered with

the enjoyment of their First Amendment rights.

In this case, the FBI sought information concerning the number

of persons who might be expected to attend protest activities at Washington,

D.C., on November 14, 15, and 16, 1969.

Further, information was

sought as to any indication that acts of violence might occur. One source

of such information was the bank account established to provide transpor-

tation for participants from New York City. The total of the deposits

would provide an indication of the extent of the transportation required and

therefore the numbers of participants that could be expected.

Access to bank records in investigations of criminzl offenses

having no First Amendment implications provides fewer legal difficulties.

A good example is United States v. Gross,

416 E2d 1205 (8th Cir. 1969)

cert. den. 397 U.S. 1013, in which a prosecution for mail and wire fraud

arising out of a check kiting scheme was based on a review of bank records.

The defendant claimed the records were inadmissible because they were

private, were obtained without the consent of the defendant and were the

product of an unlawful search and seizure. The court disagreed and held

6-13-72

MEMORANDUM 5-72

-3 -

NW. 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 494

---

## Page 495

that such records are not the proporty of the customer and the customer

has no standing to objent on Fourt: da Fifth Amendment grounds. While

the records in this cace were obtained by subpoena, the important principle

to be observed is that the records do not belong to the depositor but to the

bank. Therefore, even in the absence of a subpoena, access to bank records

pursuant to an official request in a criminal case would not taint the..

evidence.

Consistent with this result is the decision in United States v.

Gerhart, 275 F. Supp. 413 (SD W. Va. 1967) in which the court approved

the practice of the FBi in examining checks presented to the bank for

payment by a gamble? who had accepted them from patrons of his gambling

establishment.

The court's decision was based on the principle that once

the checks had been honored at the bank they became the property of the

bank and the gambler lost all legal interest in them.

General guicelines may be drawn from the above authorities to

descrihe the limitations on FBI access and use of the information in bank

records. They are available principally by subpoena but also by request

where the need for them can be demonstrated in a criminal case or in a

security matter involving important government interests such as those in

the Fifth Avenue case. Not tie Fowth or Fifth Amendments, but the First

Amendment, stands in the way of unlimited review of bank records and the

rights it protects may be found to be more important than the government

• interest behind the request even though the request is formalized in a

subpoena. Only impartial judicial analysis of each case wherein such

conflict occurs will resolve the issue whether disclosure by the bank is

necessary or proper.

In the course of liaison contacts, bank representatives may

express a different view in these matters because the banks stand in a

special relationship with the account holders. Some courts have recognized

an implied contractual requirement on the banks in favor of their depositors

to keep account records free from outside scrutiny until disclosure is

compelled by court order. Peterson v. Idaho First National Bank,

367 P2d

284 (Idaho 1961) (individual depositor); Milohnich v. First National Bank of

Miami Springs; 224 So. 2d 759 (District Court oi Appeal, Florida, 1969)

(corporate depositor); Brex v. Smith, 146 A24 (Court of Chancery, New

Jersey, 1929) (class action - depositors protected were all members of the

Newark, New Jersey, Police Department) However, it should be noted

that the court in the Fiith Avenue case also dismissed the suit against the

that, simply ich there to the formation t th been deal not, ng the ground

upon the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs.

Review of bank records should be requested only when needed

to meet a legitimate investigative objective. Where such access is denied

or where established policy of denial makes such request unnecessary,

and the information is still desired, advise the Bureau promptly.

supersede all previous instructions.

With the exception of Selective Service delinquents. the

appropriate substantive Division at Headquarters must approve all

individuals and vehicles before they are entered into the Stop Index

File. Therefore, communications requesting entry of a record must

be directed to the attention of the appropriate Division.

A new form (FD-457) has been developed that will

accommodate entry, modification, and cancellation of Stop Index File

records. A sample of the FD-457 is attached. The form is self-

explanatory. A supply of these forms will be furnished to each field

office.

For Selective Service delinquents, the field should continue

to use the Wanted-Flash-Cancellation Notice (FD-155). One copy

should be designated for the Voucher-Statistical Section, Computer

Systems Division, rather than National Crime Information Center

(NCIC). The Special Investigative Division does not have to approve

Selective Service delinquents prior to their entry.

For your information, the categories now authorized for

entry into the Stop Index File, by their respective Division, are as

approval.

There is no objection to requesting reservations, travel

to be burdensome, I should be advised.

(B) AUTOMOTIVE EQUIPMENT USED IN SURVEILLANCES -- You are

reminded of the necessity that automotive equipment used in surveillances

be sufficiently varied as to minimize the danger that persons under

surveillances will recognize it as "policemen's equipment." A limited

amount of special surveillance equipment is located in the various offices.

Efforts will be made in the future to augment this equipment. Until

procurement of sufficiently varied automotive equipment can be obtained,

you are authorized to make appropriate use of rental equipment where

necessary; however, it is your responsibility to see that such rental

equipment is completely justified. Whenever such use will be extensive

and the cost is estimated to exceed $100, prior Bureau authority must be

obtained and may be obtained on an expedite basis. You are reminded of

the importance of maintaining special surveillance vehicles and

equipment

in a secure manner to insure none of our surveillances are in any way

jeopardized. Existing regulations require that all radio-equipped

surveillance trucks be provided separate garage and storage treatment.

The desirability of maintaining other surveillance automotive equipment

separately from cur normal equipment should be carefully evaluated.

Where circumstances dictate, such equipment should be provided the

same separate facilities as is now required of radio-equipped surveillance

trucks. Appropriate manual changes concerning the rental of surveillance

equipment will be forthcoming.

(C) INTERVIEWS OF SUBJECTS OF SUBVERSIVE-TYPE AND

REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES -- INVESTIGATIONS ON

AUTHORITY OF SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE - SECURITY

INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS - SAC Letter 68-74 dated

December 24, 1968, authorized Special Agents in Charge to approve

interviews of rank-and-file black and white extremists as well as -

officers of white extremist groups up to state level unless employed

in or connected with areas of sensitivity.

Such interviews have been a primary source for the

development of significant and timely data on possible violations of

Federal statutes and have additionally resulted in the Bureau's

development of quality extremist informants.

It is apparent that expansion of SAC autority regarding

additional interviews will not only provide greater latitude of action

in the field but also will streamline operations by reducing the

amount of paper work in the field and at. Bureau Headauarters.

Effective immediately with regard to subversive and revolutionary

organizations, Special Agents in Charge are authorized to approve

interviews of rank-and-file members and their counterparts in

similar nonmembership groups.

Bureau authority, however, will continue to be necessary

prior to interview of subjects when circumstances indicate a delicate

situation and a greater than usual risk involved, such as nationally

prominent individuals, labor leaders and persons in educational,

mass media, religious or publishing fields. Bureau authority should

also be obtained to interview those who have publicly disclosed or are

likely to disclose to the mass media contacts by Bureau Agents for

the purpose of placing the Bureau in a bad light by falsely charging

harassment or who have misstated or are likely to misstate the facts

concerning the interview for self-serving purposes.

Manual and Handbook changes follow.

_Memorandum to All Special Agents in Charge

(A) CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF FBI FILES AND INVESTIGATIONS

AND SECURITY OF BUREAU SPACE -- Certain recent incidents dictate

that we reexamine at this time the quality of the continuing instructions

being given to our employees concerning the sanctity and integrity of FBI

files. It is essential that thorough and effective presentations be made

to all personnel at regular intervals to insure that they are thoroughly

familiar with the confidential nature of our files. The protection of

information delivered to us is one of our most important, if not the

most important, of our interests, and we must maintain tight security

in this area if we are to warrant the continued confidence of the

American people. In this regard, we must also guard against loose

talk, even among ourselves. Our investigations are not to be dis-

cussed with any of our colleagues except those who have a need to

know. You should also reemphasize to your employees at this time

the need for complete security ci FBI premises.

Instructions have been issued to you periodically concerning

the above matters, and you should refer to SAC Letter 67-16(A) dated

March 14, 1967. That SAC Letter contains an enclosure with 22

separate points relating generally to the confidential nature of the

Bureau's work, the security of space and information, the security

01 Bureau property, and penalties imposed for violations of security

regulations. That enclosure captioned "Security indoctrination of

FBI Employees" has been amended and a revision of same is attached.

You should utilize this document to implement your instructions to

your employees but should not be restricted to this material. Any

additional security precautions necessary for your particular office

should also be forcefully brought to the attention of your employees.

(C) CONSPIRACY TO IMPED OR INJURE OFFICER - Your attention

is directed to Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 372. This Statute provides

that if two or mora persons conspire to prevent by force, intimidation,

or threat any person from holling office under the United States, 0r

from discharging any duties thereof, or to injure him in his person or

property on account of his lawul discharge of the duties of his office

or impede him in the discharge of his official duties, each of such

persons shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more

than six years or both. The Assaulting a Federal Officer Statute, Title

18, U. S. Code, Section 111, covers FBI employees and states that

whoever forcibly assaults, impedes, intimidates, etc., violates the

statute. Thus to violate Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 111, some force

must be used. However, Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3T2, since It

does not require the prohibited acts be committed "forcibly"' provides

broader coverage for our employees in those instances where two or

more subjects are involved. All Agent personnel are to be alerted to

and utilize the Conspiracy to Irapede or Injure Officer Statute in

furtherance of their respective oïficial duties in those instances where

the Assaulting a Federal Officer Statute is not applicable.

United States, at any level of employment, determined to have

been responsible for any release or disclosure of national

security information or material in a manner-not-authorized

by or under this order or a directive of the President issued

through the National Security Council. Where a violation of

criminal statutes may be involved, Departments will refer any

such case promptly to the Department of Justice.' "

Memorandum to All Special Agents in Charge

(A) LAW ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM (LEEP) LOANS --

Reference is made to SAC Letters 69-34(B, dated June 24, 1969, and

71-36(A) dated August 3, 1971. These outlined basic information and

Bureau policy concerning handling of requests from applicants for

financial aid in the form of grants and loans to attend college for law

enforcement officers and students planning law enforcement careers

as provided by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of

1968.

The Bureau will now consider on an individual basis requests

from former employees for a letter required for LEEP loan applicants

indicating the Bureau will willingly consider the applicant as a desirabie

candidate for employment in the "criminal justice" field upon graduation

or completion of college and meeting required qualifications. As you

know, this is not a commitment to actually employ the loan applicant.

We will require a statement from the former employee as to his intentions

to pursue a career in law enforcement. This should also contain his

address plus the identity of the school official, title and address, in-

cluding zip code number, to whom the letter, if approved, is to be sub-

mitted. As you will recall, the Bureau's principal "criminal justice"

position is that of Special Agent. If the loan applicant is a former

employee of your division, submit your evaluation of the individual in-

volved and recommendation as to whether the letter should be supplied.

Current employees should continue to submit their requests

in the same manner as prescribed in above reference. Individuals with

no prior Bureau affiliation should continue to be informed we are unable

to comply with their request for an "employability letter" and a record

is to be kept of such requests. Any correspondence relative to this

matter should be addressed--Attention: Personnel Section.

(B) SPECIAL AGENTS ACTING UNDERCOVER - The Bureau held a

three-day seminar on Stolen and Counterfeit Securities cases for Agents

from selected offices between June 12 and 14, 1972. About six hours of

this seminar were devoted to exchange of ideas on informant develop-

ment, handling and control and to undercover activities: The consensus

of opinion at the seminar was that the technique of placing an Agent

undercover is not sufficiently recognized or encouraged.

This technique should be considered whenever you are faced

with the situation where your subjects are looking for an outlet for

stolen property. The opportunity to utilize this technique will ordinarily

come to your attention when an informant advises that a particular subject

is in possession of stolen property or contraband and is attempting to

dispose of same. In such a situation, the undercover Agent supplies the

outlet and places the subject in a position where he can be arrested in

the act of disposing of this material and the material recovered. The

technique, therefore, is suited to Theft of Government Property, Inter-

State Transportation of Stolen Property, and Theft From Interstate

Shipment cases. It has also been utilized to good advantage in gambling

investigations where Agents have been introduced into the "game" as

participants or customers and thereby lay the basis for the arrest or

raid. There are other instances where an undercover Agent can be a

valuable asset in our investigations.

The advantage over utilizing an informant in the same situation

is that the Agent is capable of acting incependently without the strict

control necessary for proper informant utilization and the Agent can, if

necessary, testify without impairing the informant. The Agent's

evidence will also be given greater weight in court than the evidence of

an informant. The Agent is a trained investigator and ordinarily will

obtain considerably more information concerning the criminal enter-

prise once he is on the "inside" than the informant.

For' a detailed discussion of this technique, your attention

is invited to Training Guide No. 4 dated June 19, 1969, captioned,

"Investigation of Stolen and Counterfeit Stock and Bond Cases." While

the "cover stories" and situations in this training guide are directed at

stock and bonds cases with slight alterations they can be used in a variety

"of situations.

(C) HARDSHIP TRANSFER REQUESTS -- There has been an increased

number of hardship transfer requests sent to FBIHQ. I recognize fully

that such requests must be given thorough and fair consideration. How-

ever, frequently, insufficient information is furnished in order that a

final and fair evaluation can be made. Therefore, the following procedures

are being placed in effect immediately in connection with such requests.

• Each such request must be forwarded to FBIHQ through the

Division Head. Any request received directly at FBIHQ will be

returned to the appropriate Division Head for necessary handling.

In the event the request is based on a problem involving

employee's parents or employee's spouse's parents, the following

information must be submitted. Their ages should be furnished as

well as written reports from any doctors involved including diagnosis,

prognosis, and any recommendation from a medical standpoint. Also

furnish the income of parents, who is assisting them now and if such

is the case why this would not he sufficient. Where do they live, such

as home or apartment; do they have a car; and, do they drive. Of

course, any other factors pertinent to the situation necessary in making

an evaluation should likewise be submitted.

If the problem relates to employee's spouse

or children

substantiating doctor's statements must be submitted setting forth

diagnosis and prognosis with the recommendation of the doctor. The

employee should also be prepared to supply necessary waivers in the

event it is necessary that the physician be contacted for additional

clarifying information.

Should the problem relate solely to the employee involved,

such as an allergy peculiar to the area of assignment, appropriate

medical statements must be furnished. Upon receipt of these, final

determination must be made by the local Government examining facility.

A thorough report of the particular situation by the Division

Head must accompany each such request with a specific recommendation

for action based on the results of the interview. In the communication

accompanying request, observations of the Division Head should include

whether a temporary assignment or a permanent change of station would

8/1/72

MEMORANDUM 14-72

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 512

## Page 513

be best in view of the circumstances or, of course, it may be recom-

mended that no action be talion. In any event, the interview by the Divi-

sion Head is considered one de the most important aspects in making a

final determination in such matters and, henceforth, merely forwarding

the necessary material with the comment that the employee receive

favorable consideration consistent with the needs of the Bureau will not

be considered acceptable. Of course, Division Head should specifically

state whether a replacement would be needed in the event favorable

consideration is given to the request. In those instances where a

temporary assignment is granted, expenses of same must be borne by

the employee.

In the event a permanent transfer is approved, employee

should understand that there will be a regular periodic follow-up to

determine if a hardship still exists. This will be done approximately

one year following the date the employee arrives at the new office of

assignment. Such employees should also understand that they will not

be considered for promotion to supervisory positions until advice is

received that they are completely available for administrative advancement.

You may be assured each case received will be given every

possible consideration. However, the above procedures must be followed

in each instance.

(D) CRIME ABOARD AIRCRAFT MATTERS - DR. DAVID GRAHAM

HUBBARD - PSYCHIATRIST -- Dr. David Graham Hubbard, born

October 5, 1920, at Dexter, New Mexico, is a psychiatrist who al-

legedly is an expert on skyjackers. In February, 1972, at the insistence

of the federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Dr. Hubbard resigned

as FAA hijacking consultant.

• This followed instances where he made*

irresponsible statements dealing with past hijackings, misquoted the

Administrator of FAA, and attempted to personally inject himself into

highly volatile hijacking situations. In one recent hijacking, he

exhibited his nuisance character by appearing on the scene and demanding

to talk to the hijackers on board the aircraft claiming he had Department

of Justice approval when, in fact, no such clearance had ever been

given.

In view of the fast-moving nature of aircraft hijacking matters,

it is imperative that there be no interference by outsiders. If Dr. Hubbard

appears in the future at the scene of a hijacking, you should act accord-

ingly and insure that he in no way participates in or interfores with the

effective investigation of a hijacking.

(E) INFORMANTS - USE OF FORM FD-356 -- Effective immediately

form FD-356 should be used when requesting routine record checks

for symbol informants. Previously such requests were sent by secure

teletype which, in many cases, required receiving offices to transcribe

information to FD-356. _ All references, such as symbol number, which

would tend to identify individual as an informart should be deleted.

Number classification (such as 134, 170, or 137) is sufficient to flag

receiving offices.

Manual and Handbook revisions follow.

An asterisk adjacent to an entry denotes the office has at least

one suggestion awaiting final decision.

The Legat Office in Manila reopened

in January, 1972, while those in Brasilia and Singapore opened in March and

April, 1972, respectively.

The total numiser of suggestions submitted was 924 of which

324 were adopted with 10 still awaiting resolution. Fourteen suggestions

from the previous two fiscal years were implemented during Fiscal Year 1972

making the overall total 338. Estimated firsi-year tangible benefits amounted

to over $200, 000 with additional intangible savings. Twenty-four employees

shared incentive awards amounting to $5890 and, in addition,& employees were

commended for, their contributions.

I wish to express my appreciation for the excellent interest and

cooperation displayed by our employees in achieving these noteworthy results.

I know I may continue to count on your wholehearted support and participation

in the Suggestion Program to help us meet the ever-increasing challenges we

face during Fiscal Year 1973.

(B) INCREASED USE OF COURT-AUTHORIZED ELECTRONIC

INTERCEPTS -- The Bureau's experience with electronic intercepts

clearly establishes their efficacy. Great inroads have been made into

organized crime especially in the gambling field by the use of this

technique.

It is felt that the Field-should-consider expanding its view.

of the areas in which this technique can be productive. You are

reminded that Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 2516, authorizes this

activity in Federal crimes involving, among others, murder, kidnaping,

robbery, extortion, Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property, Theft

From Interstate Shipment, Embezzlement of Pension and Welfare Funds,

Bribery, and Extortionate Credit Transactions.

It would appear that the utilization of this technique should

be considered wherever you have an enumerated offense particularly

those involving conspiratorial activity. Specifically, electronic

surveillance of a fence shoul i develop evidence implicating the fence

and the thieves he is doing business with in violation of the Interstate

Transportation of Stolen Property or Theft From Interstate Shipment

Statutes and produce a situation in which the fence can be prosecuted

together with many of the thieves that are supplying him with

merchandise. You should be alert to this kind of a situation in the

implementation of the Top jewel Thief program and in the investigation

of stolen securities cases. Some areas of the country have evidence

, that burglary rings are operating and electronic intercepts on a

principal member of such a ring should also be considered.

In all our investigative activity we must insure that our

Agents are fully aware of the extent of authority that has been granted

them in fulfilling their responsibilities and that it is being fully utilized.

Court-authorized electronic surveillance is one of the areas in which

we must insure all of our Agents have a firm understanding and a

willingness to expend the energy necessary to utilize this valuable

investigative tool.

(C) TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTION --

The following instructive Federal decisions reported in

June, 1912, should be read by all Legal Instructors: Acams v. Williams,

United States Supreme Court, June 12, 1972, officer had right to stop

and frisk on report of apparently reliable informant that nearby suspect

in high crime area during early morning hours was carrying narcotics

and had a gun at his waist. U.S. v. Brown, 457 E2d 731 (1972)(Ist Cir.),

officer investigating case has right to go upon private land even in absence

of probable cause. If officer finds stolen property he has right to remove

it if there is danger that it might be removed or destroyed by others while

a search warrant is being obtained. U.S. v. Ware, 457 F2d 828 (1972)

(7th Cir.), when officer has legitimate reason to identity a vehicle, it

is not a forbidden search to check the confidential serial number. U.S

ex rel. Moore v. Koelzer, 457 F2d 892 (1972)(3d Cir.), Federal Officers

are not immune from civil suits for damages for violation of constitutional

rights. U.S. v. Holiday, 457 F2d 912 (1972)(3d Cir.), FBI Agents made

emergency entrance to house to arrest bank robbers.

Subjects not there.

Agents properly seized evidence of the offense seen in plain view.

U.S. v. Cecil, 457 F2d 1178 (1972)(8th Cir.); officers lawfully in

dwelling to arrest known person had right to arrest unknown third party

found there holding a sawed-off shotgun. Advanced knowledge that gun

was not registered not required. U.S. V. Bell, 457 F2d 1231 (1972)

(5th Cir.), when informant is victim or eyewitness to crime, officer

preparing complaint or affidavit need not show proof of informant's

reliability. Photo display to witnesses not impermissibly suggestive

simply because suspect's photo was full length and others were bust type.

U.S. v. Wysocki,

- 457 E2d 1155 (1972)(5th Cir.), bank robbery suspect

arrested in motel room and seated in chair asked Agent to get his clothes

from closet. In closet saw box like common gun box, opened it and

found fruits of the crime. Evidence admissible. Colten v. Kentucky,

United States Supreme Court, June 12, 1972, officers properly enforcing

the law have right to do so "free from possible interference or interruption

from bystanders, even those claiming a third party interest in the transaction."

Defendant properly arrested and convicted for failure to move on when so

directed by officer. Argersinger v. Hamlin, United States Supreme Court,

June 12, 1972, absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may

be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor,

or felony, unless represented by counsel at trial. U.S. v. Smith, 340

F: Supp. 1023 (1972)(D. Conn.), items lawfully seized in search of arrested

- person, and placed in evidence envelope, may be later reexamined by

officers. Car which officers had probable cause to search at time of

arrest therein may be searched without warrant after arrestee is taken

to station. FBI affidavit for search warrant for premises failed to satisfy

conversations for 12 or 13 days did not violate the "minimization" rule

under the facts of this case. Beightol v. Kunowski, 340 F. Supp. 1134,

(1972)(M.D. Pa.), a state defendant released on bail without being finger-

printed or photographed and who the next day returned voluntarily to the

magistrate's office for his preliminary hearing could lawfully be seized by

police and fingerprinted and photographed without warrant or other process.

U.S. v. Troutman, 458 F2d 217 (1972)(10th Cir.), probable cause is

determined from the collective information possessed by all officers

involved in the arrest rather than from only that of the officer actually

making the arrest. U.S. v. Singer, 341 F. Supp. 136 (1972)(D, Del.),

where FBI Agent obtained written waiver of Miranda rights and subject

then confessed and voluntarily gave Agent incriminating personal documents

from her purse, the Miranda warning made the documents admissible in

evidence without proof of warning on right to be free from unreasonable

search and seizure. Hoover v. Slayton, 341 F. Supp. 317 (1972)(W.D. Va.),

One man showap of suspect to victim within three hours of the crime held

proper. U.S. V. Davis, 458 F2d 819 (1972)(D. Cir.), good review review.2f

factors important to establishing probable cause. U.S. v. Harper, 458

F2d 891 (1971)(7th Cir.), incriminating records of gambling enterprise

• taken by employee without any prior contact with Government agents are

admissible in evidence. U.S. V. Sadler, 458 F2d 906 (1972)(10th Cir.),

officer who lawfully stopped car for routine registration check not

required to give Miranda warnings before he had learned facts indicating

car stolen. U.S. V. Mitchell, 458 F2d 960 (1972)(9th Cir.), decision

strongly endorses police practice of inventorying and safekeeping

personal property visible in an impounded car.

ment in panel discussions and specified Field procedures in handling

such invitations, which instructions are hereby reiterated and emphasized.

Radio and television appearances are obviously included in

these instructions.

While it is recognized that the nature of a program is

ordinarily volunicied by the inviting party, it is incumbent on you to

specifically determine this data if such information is not provided

to insure that Bureau representatives are not inadvertently placed in

disadvantageous positions.

(D) REPORT WRITING- SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS --

Airtel to all SACs dated November 15, 1971. Captioned "Security Investi-

gations of Individuals" (Section 87G, Manual of Instructions), sets forth

the reporting schedule for the submission of periodic reports or letter-

head memoranda for the various categories of the Administrative Index

(ADEX).

In order to effect economy, reduce the required paper work

in the field, and release Agent personnel for more effective and productive

utilization of time in the security field, the following changes are being

made in the reporting requirements in security investigations of individuals:

1. Semiannual, annual, and biennial reports or letterhead

memoranda no longer need be submitted solely for the sake of reporting.

2. An initial summary report must be submitted at the time

the subject is recommended for inclusion on the ADEX and should beas

complete as possible.

3. Current significant pertinent information and/or activities

of the subject should be reported on a current basic as it occurs utilizing

teletypes, nitels, or airtels with letterhead memoranda suitable for dis-

semination.

4. In the event the complexity or prosecutive potential of case

or other reasons so dictate, the SAC or Headquarters may instruct that

reports be submitted.

5. These instructions in no way alter present investigative

and reporting requirements as they pertain to organizations.

6. Our responsibility to disseminate fresh, timely intelligence

information to other government agencies is in no way diminished by this

streamlining of reporting requirements. It is expected that with the

reduction of repetitive paper work, we should be in a better position in the

security field to develop a higher caliber of intelligence information

through the additional time that we can now devote to the development of

quality sources and informants.

(E) ADMINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX) - STREAMLINING MEASURES --

ADEX has now been in operation for more than & months, during which

time a thorough evaluation of its eftectiveness and procedures has been

made. Based on discussions with field personnel as well as our own

observations at Bureau Headquarters, it is believed that several major

revisions should be made at this time.

ADEX has represented a listing of individuals engaged in sub-

versive activity who are considered a potential or actual threat to the

national security. As now constituted, it is divided into four categories

corresponding to varying degrees of dangerousness. The current ADEX

criteria are broadly worded and allow the inclusion of individuals who,

although they subscribe to subversive or revolutionary doctrines, do not

necessarily represent a danger to the national security at this time.

After a careful assessment of this matter, it is believed that

ADEX criteria should be amended to provide for the inclusion only of

individuals who pose a realistic, direct, and current danger to the national

security. In other words, it is believed ADEX siould list only persons who

are regarded as dangerous now.

In reviewing existing criteria, it is believed that essentially

those individuals who are presently in Categories I and II would meet the

test of being dangerous now, but that most, if not all; of those in

Categories III and IV would not. It is further believed that ADEX should

not be broken into separate categories, but should be a single, selective

listing. It is also felt that ADEX should be strictly a by-product of our

investigative activity and not in and of itself generate any investigation

or govern reporting procedures.

Accordingly, the following revisions with respect to ADEX are

being placed in effect immediately:

1. REVISED CRITERIA

Only the following individuals should be included in ADEX:

Individuals, whether affiliated with organized groups or not,

who have shown a willingness and capability of engaging in treason,

rebellion or insurrection, seditious conspiracy, sabotage, espionage,

terrorism, guerrilla warfare, assassination of Government officials or

leaders, or other such acts which would result in interference with or a

threat to the survival and effective operation of national, state or local

government.

This would include leaders of organizations whose aims in-

clude the overthrow or destruction of the United States or the government

of any State, Territory, district, or possession thereof, or the govern-

ment of any political subdivision therein, by unlawful means. Mere

membership in such organizations is not sufficient in itself to warrant

inclusion in ADEX.

The term "leaders" denotes those individuals, irrespective

of title, who are in a position to significantly influence the policies or

direct the activities of the group.

Individuals should 'e considered "dangerous now" to the

national security when reliable information has been received that they

have engaged in activity falling within the above-described criteria during

the past two years and there is no indication they have given up or ceased

to engage in such activity.

There may be some instances where retention of an individual

in ADEX is justified even though no specific information is available dur=

ing the prior two years. For example, such retention would be warranted

in the case of individuals who have gone into hiding, left the country,

have been imprisoned, or sirilar circumstances and there is no reliable

information available indicating that they have renounced activities

covered in the above criteria.

2. IMPLEMENTATION OF REVISIONS

In order to bring about the desired revision of ADEX without

creating an additional work load both for the field and Bureau Headquarters,

the following procedures will be followed:

2.

Arrangement of ADEX into categories is hereby abolished.

Until such time as cases on each individual now included in ADEX can be

reviewed, ADEX will include only the names of those individuals now listed

under Categories I and II.

9/12/72

b. It is recoguized that many individuals currently listed in

Categories I and II do not fall within the criteria as described herein.

Likewise, it is possible that some individuals currently listed in Category

III or even Category IV could fall within the new criteria. However, to

avoid having to make an immediate determination of eligibility for ADEX

by reviewing each case, the arbitrary listing of Category I and II and

arbitrary deletion of Categories III and IV is being made at the outset.

c. Existing Category I cases are all in pending status at this

time. Each of these cases should be reviewed at time it next comes up

for reporting or verification purposes in line with ticklers set up under

the old ADEX rules. A determination should then be made as to whether

or not the subject meets the new criteria. If so, submit FD-122 to this

effect including succinct statement citing specific basis for inclusion.

If not, recommend deletion from ADEX by FD-122.

d. In connection with Category II subjects, no immediate

action is required. Case should be reopened when it is next scheduled

for verification ünder the old rules. Determination should then be made

as to whether or not subject meets new criteria. Thereafter, handle as

set out above regarding Category I subjects.

• e. Concerning Category III and IV subjects, no immediate -

action is necessary. (As indicated above, these individuals will have

been arbitrarily removed from the new ADEX.) These cases should be

reopened in accordance with the former ADEX verification schedule and

reviewed to determine whether or not the subject meets the new criteria.

If the individual does not meet the revised criteria, as can be expected

in most instances, advise Bureau by routing slip that review has been

made and subject does not meet new ADEX criteria. No further explana-

tion or comments are necessary. Also make appropriate notation in

field office file to the effect case has been reviewed and Bureau advised

that subject does not meet ADEX criteria. No additional action is needed.

It, on review; it is believed a Category III or IV subject does

meet the new criteria, submit FD-122 recommending subject for ADEX

and including a succinct statement justifying such action.

f. Form FD-122 will require revision for complete suitability

under the revised ADEX. However, you should continue to use the current

form until such revisions can be made.

g. Do not destroy any existing ADEX cards until instructed

to do so by Bureau. Category I and II cards should now be consolidated

to form revised ADEX. Category III and IV cards should be set aside

in separate inactive file (for possible future incorporation in ADEX when

cases are individually reviewed). Should it later be determined that cards

it Categories III and IV should be included in revised ADEX, such cards -

can then be moved into new ADEX. Eventually, all cards in revised ADEX

will be the same color. However, until new card is actually required

due to change of information, card being used now under current ADEX

categories should continue to be used. Category designation should be

deleted on all cards included in revised ADEX.

3. DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR ADEX

INCLUSION

The Bureau recognizes that anyone who has embraced a

philosophy that includes advocacy of the overthrow of our form of govern-

ment is a potential enemy. However, in many instances an individual may

believe in some other form of government or even in the overthrow of our

form of government, but have no willingness or capability of engaging in

activity other than a philosophical discussion or debate. Such persons

subscribe to an alien philosophy, but their activities have not gone beyond

an ideological stage. This would include attendance at meetings, taking--

part in theoretical discussions or other activity which stops short of

advocating or engaging in action to overthrow the United States.

Examples might be members of the Communist Party, USA,

or the Socialist Workers Party, or other old-linerevolutionary groups

which basically advocate an overthrow of our present form of government,

but where the subject's activity has been ideological in nature and not

oriented toward action.

- In this connection, however, each case must be

reviewed on its individual merits, since the willingness and capability of

individuals to engage in action dangerous to the national security is the

primary factor in making a determination for inclusion in ADEX.

Under normal circumstances members of such hate groups as

the Ku Klux Klan would not meet the criteria for inclusion in ADEX. There

could be exceptions, however, and each case must be examined individually

to determine if it meets the new criteria. These criteria can apply to

persons involved with extreme right as well as extreme left organizations,

or to individuals who have no affiliation with organized groups but whe are

anarchists and are engaged in attempts to destroy the United States.

C

The test is whether an individual has shown a willingness and

intent coupled with a capability to engage in activity covered in the ADEX

criteria and represents a current danger to the national security.

4: MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS

a. At the time an individual is recommended for ADEX under

the revised criteria, an administrative tickler should be prepared and set

to come up two years later. This tickler is independent of any assignment

card maintained on the case and is solely for the purpose of insuring

that all ADEX cases are reviewed at 2-year intervals to insure that they

continue to meet the criteria. When an ADEX case comes up for review

on such tickler, it should be carefully reviewed and a determination made

as to whether or not the subject's activities continue to fall within ADEX

criteria. If so, the tickler should be reset for an auditional two years.

If not, institute appropriate action to delete subject from ADEX by

FD-122 and destroy tickler.

b. If ai any time information is receive indicating that ADEs .

subject has changed his residence or employment addresses, appropriate

inquiry should be conducted and the Bureau advised by FD-122 if change

of address is verified.

c. If at any time information is received that an individual

carried in the ADEX no longer meets the criteria, appropriate inquiry

should be immediately instituted to resolve the matter. If it is determined

the subject no longer meets ADEX criteria, submit FD-122 recommending

deletion.

d. When subject is being recommended for ADEX, an investi-

gative report should be submitted summarizing the subject's activities and

setting forth his background, unless a report was previously furnished to

the Bureau in the case. In the latter instance, submit a report or LHM

bringing subject's activities up to date. No additional reports or LHMS

are required merely for.ADEX purposes. Changes or deletions in

pertinent background information or other data contained on the ADEX

card should be made by FD-122. Of course, any reporting requirements

set forth elsewhere in the Manual of Instructions or otherwise requested

by Bureau Headquarters should be adhered to.

e. Prior requirements concerning the periodic verification

of the employment and residence addresses of ADEX subjects are

abolished.

f. An individual's employment at a Key Facility is not a

determining factor as to whether or not he should be included in ADEX.

Persons employed in key facilities should be included in ADEX only if

they otherwise meet the new criteria.

Appropriate manual changes will follow. Any questions which

may arise in connection with the new ADEX criteria or any matter which

the field believes requires additional clarification, should promptly be

brought to the attention of Bureau Headquarters, attention Research

Section, Domestic Intelligence Division, using caption "ADEX."

1969, and 71-36 (A) dated August 3, 1971, which set out basic policy

concerning LEEP grants and loans.

It has recently been brought to the Bureau's attention that

Bureau cierical employees in the Washingion, D. C., area making their

first application for a loan under LEEP are being advised that there are

no funds available for students newly entering the Program in the

Washington, D. C., area. Law Enforcement Assistance Administration

officials advised that there may be some funds available for new student

loans beginning with the Winter quarter or semester; however, there

can be no guarantee that all students applying will be granted a loan.

The above information is being made available to all Field

Offices for information in connection with the clerical applicant recruit-

ment program for t'BI Headquarters. All persons inquiring about

educational opportunities in the Washington, D. C., area under the

LEEP should be advised of the current situation concerning availability

of funds.

(E) INTERVIEWS WITH SUBJECTS OF SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS --

Current Bureau regulations require that interviews with subjects of

security investigations should be conducted by two Agents. Additionally

two Agents should be physically present during interview or contact with

known or suspected Nation of Islam members in all cases. In white

extremist investigations, such as the Klan, two Agents should be present -

at interview when considerations of sensitivity or security warrant or

when good judgment dictates.

Taking into consideration the significant diversity between the

philosophies and propensity for violence of the organizations and individuals

that come within the purview of our security investigative jurisdiction, the

above requirements have been carefully analyzed and reviewed.

In order to streamline operations, and provide greater latitude

to the field, effective immediately, Special Agents in Charge are being

given the responsibility and ption of deciding when two Agents should be

present during interview of ¿ny security subject. This applies to all

types of security investigaticns, i.e., revolutionary, subversive, and

extremist.

Security, sensitivity and good judgment should continue to be

considerations in evaluating necessity for two Agents to conduct inter-

views of this nature.

Manual and Handbook changes follow.

HATE -- In order to standardize and limit dissemination of information

pertaining to white extremists, dissemination policy as set forth in

Manual of Instructions, Section 122, page 5, item 9 a, should be dis-

continued.

Effective immediately, you should furnish Navy, Army, and

Air Force, on a local level, only those reports or letterhead memoranda

pertaining to unaffiliated white extremists or individuals connected

with such Klan or other white extremist organizations where there is a

specific bona fide interest in the individual by the specific military

agency. Such documents should be furnished locally only in those

instances where the information pertains to military personnel,

individuals connected with the military, and/or organized or individual

activities planned against a specific military base. Do not disseminate

organizational reports unless a specific request is received from the

interested military agency.

Changes in Manual of Instructions will be forthcoming.

(B) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you are aware

informants and sources receiving compensation from the Bureau are

reimbursed on the basis of the value of the information reported,

services performed and expenses incurred. An increasing tendency

has been observed in field submissions to request special payments or

justify regular payments for informants or sources seemingly based

on personal needs of the informant as distinct from the value of infor-

mation furnished and legitimate and related expenses incurred. The

personal needs of an informant, such as repair of a vehicle, illness

or other pressing necessity for funds, do not meet the basic criteria

of information furnished or related expenses. Informants shouid not

be influenced to believe we will pay for such personal needs. The

basic concept that the informant is selling information of value on a

•C..O.d. basis, much as an independent contractor, and is not an

employee must be adhered to and understood by contacting Agents and

the informants.

This does not, however, preclude use of imagination and in-

novation when a source of considerable potential value needs financial

inducement to engage in gathering of information under conditions which

will take time to reach fruition and may involve considerable risk and

hardship. In such instances you should fully develop the facts and

present them to FBIH@ for approval prior to making any commitment.

This matter will continue to receive careful attention at FBIHQ

and you will be held accountable to insure that payments are for value

received. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling informants and sources.

(C) ADEX - SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS --

The revision of ADEX initiated by Memorandum to All SACs

21-72, dated September 12, 1972, should not ba construed as a reduction in

this. Bureau's efforts in the national security field. While the ADEX is now

to contain only individuals determined by investigation to be "dangerous

now, " there has been no change or relaxation in our responsibilities to

identify on a continuing basis through appropriate investigations those

individuals who may be dangerous or potentially dangerous to the national

security. It is important also to keep in mind that to obtain vital information

relating to national security matters, we must not relax our efforts to

develop and maintain a strong security informant program. The continued

maintenance of a strong informant program will enable us to identify those

who represent a current threat to the national security and who should be

included in ADEX. Additionally, a good informant program makes it

possible to redirect manpower resources to other high priority matters

in the internal security fieid.

Insofar as policy of instituting security investigations of

individuals is concerned, there has been no change in the policy set forth

in Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions. The same is true regarding

dissemination of information developed during security investigations of -

individuals. Aside from the provisions set forth in SAC Memorandum

21-72 (D) streamlining reporting procedures, policy on dissemination of

data developed in security investigations of individuals outlined in

Section 87H of the Manual of Instructions continues to apply. Agents

and supervisors handling secirity investigations should be thoroughly

familiar with these two sections of the Manual of Instructions.

For your information, a system of listing subversive and

extremist individuals for future identification and reference aside from

those included in ADEX is presently being formulated at the Bureau.

(A) FUGITIVE MATTERS--(a) FUGITIVE FORM LETTER (FD-65),

and (b) REDORTING APPREHENSION OR DISMISSAL OF PROCESS

PRIOR TO APPREUENSION; NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION

CENTER (NCIC) -- In the past the NCIC Control Room handled all

NCIC entries and other transactions for offices without an NCIC terminal.

Presently all field offices have access to NCIC through

their own terminal devices, except for the Anchorage and San Juan

Offices. Installation ci NCIC terminals in the Anchorage and San Juan

Offices is expected in the near future.

Until such time as a terminal is

installed in these oifices, NCIC transactions involving fugitives will be

handled temporarily for them through the NCIC terminal located in the

Special Investigative Division, Fugitive Section. Other transactions

for these two oftices will continue to be handled by the NCIC Control

Room.

Since offices now have the capability of handling their

own NCIC transactions by direct communications with the NCIC computer

through their own terminal devices, or in the case of the Anchorage and

the San Juan Offices having this done for them by the Fugitive Section, it—

is no longer necessary to provide the NCIC Control Room with data nec-

essary to "enter" fugitives in NCIC, or location/apprenension or dismissal

of process information needed to "clear" or "cancel" a fugitive's NCIC

record.

Therefore, effective immediately, all offices are to

achere to the following instructions. The original only of Fugitive Form

Letter (CD-65) is to be submitted to the Bureau. Further, a copy of

airtels reporting apprehension/location or dismissal of process prior

to apprehension should no longer be submitted to NCIC. Submit only

original of Deserter Fugitive Airtel (FD-220, blue) and one copy of

FD-220a, (thin white) to Bureau in deserter fugitive matters. When

teletypes are used for reporting this type of information, the abbreviation

"NCIC" is no longer to be placed in the title.

The above should be brought to the attention to all investi-

gative and stenographic personnel. Appropriate manual changes are

forthcoming.

(B) VISITORS TO RUSSIA - INTERNAL SECURITY - RUSSIA -- Over

the past several months, information has come to the attention of the

Bureau which indicates that various United States manulacturing concerns

are sending technical representatives io the Soviet Union in connection

-with-the-sale-of industrial-equipment_to_that country. Individuals in this

category may be presumed to have an extensive technical background

and their assignment in the Soviet Union may range from several days

to several weeks. They present an attractive target for recruitment

by Soviet intelligence services and their extended residence also presents

ample opportunity for assessment and a recruitment approach.

You should insure that all investigative personnel who have

responsibilities in this area are aware of these circumstances. If

instances of this type come to your attention, it is desired that investi-

gation be undertaken and, in the absence of lactors dictating to the

contrary, interviews be conducted to determine if recruitment approaches

• have been.made...

Follow instructions controlling investigations in this category

which are contained in Section 105G, Manual of Instructions. Advise

Bureau of results of any investigations initiated.

(A) EXPUNGING ARREST DATA - The volume of correspondence from

citizens, aitorneys, and court officials, concerning the expungement of arrest

data from FBI identification files has increased substantially. Accordingly,

we se immediately disseminating a letter to all fingerprint contributors

(cr y attached).

Bear in mind that while non-Federal arrest prints will be returned

to the submitting agency upon request,

•the same procedure is not followed as

regards Federal arrest prints. The latter are property of the United States

Government and are retained permanently in our files. U. S. Marshals Marual.

702. 02, provides "Fingerprint records may not in any case be returned to a

defendant, whether or not he is acquitted of the charge against him. " U. S.

Aitorneys Manual, 8-83: provides "United States Attorneys are directed to

vigorously oppose ail petitions, applications, or motions filed in any district

court seeking the return or destruction of such records." The Federal courts

consistently nave upheid this right to retain Federal arrest prints.

In your contacts with law enforcement agencies and court officials,

please emphasize that we will return non-Federal arrest prints only to the

contributing agency and this results in an automatic expunction of such

information in our files. The request for the return of prints must emanate

from the contributing agency. We will not honor requests from other sources,.

including court orders supplied directly by local courts, even though charges

have been dismissed or subject acquitted. All Special Agents in your office

should be thoroughly familiar with these procedures.

Department of Justice seeking guidelines as to investigative and prosecutive

handling of these matters.

Until such time as advice is furnished by. the Department, any

complaints received which fall within the areas of the amended statute

hould be thoroughly discussed with the appropriate U. S. Attorney prior to

conducting any investigation to determine whether prosecution would be

pursued by the U. S. Attorney should a violation be proven.

Department. Appropriate Manual and FBI Handbook changes will be

forthcoming.

(E) TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTORS - The following significant decisions

reported in Dccember, 1970, should be read by all Legal Instructors: U. S.

v. Edmons, 132 F2d 577 (1970) (2d Cir.), exclusionary rule outlaws evidence

obtained as dircct resuit of pretext arrest; U. S. V. Kaye, 132 F2d 647 (1970)

(D.C. Cir.), when description of premises to be searched is narrower in

warrant than in affidavit, warrant description controls; U. S. v. Cobb, 432

F2d 716 (1970) (4th Cir.) example of inadequate search warrant affidavit; any

person against whom search is directed has standing to complain: v. S. v.

Bekowies, 432 F2d 8 (1970) (9th Cir.), example of suspect being in custody

for Miranda purposes while being questioned by officers in his own home;

V. S. v. Barnes. 132 F2d 89 (1970) (9th Cir.), arrested suspects who refused

to waive Miranda rights were confronted by officers with third suspect who

then and there confessed. Original two suspects then confessed on being asked

by officers if third suspect's story was true. Confessions of original two

suspects not admissible; U. S. v. Fish, 432 E2d 107 (1970) (4th Cir.), absent

any unusual circumstances, questioning of suspect by officer in his own home

is noncustodial and does not r'equire Miranda warnings; Henry v. U. S:,

432 F2d 114 (1970) (9th Cir.), suspect in custody is noi entitled to counsel

when sample of his hair is taken for scientific examination as possible

-_evidence; U. S. v. James, 432 I2d 303 (1970) (5th Cir.), FBI warrantless

i search of jailed suspect's personal effects taken six hours earlier by sheritt

- ras reasonable because delay ior warrant might have frustrated government's

continuing and urgent investigation; U. S. v. Seay, 432 F2d 395 (1970) (5th

Cir.), if probable cause for local arrest was present, arrest is legal despite_

officer's plan to only hold suspect for federal charges.

Police towing of

suspect's locked car to storage place is not unreasonabie; Shepherd v. Nelson,

432 E2d 1045 (1970) (2d Cir.), FBI Agents who arrested subject in bank could

lawfully delay complete search of subject and his brief case until arrival a:

FBI office to which subject was promptly taken; U. S. v. Kersiner,

432 F2d

1066 (1970) (5ih Cir.), FBI frisis of murder suspect for weapon was not an

arrest. Confession implicating confessor and second defendant may be used

in evidence against confessor by deleting

references io second defendant;

U. S. v. Hamlin, 432 F2d 905 (1970) (8th Cír.), Miranda warnings not

necessary for interview of suspect who arrives at federal office voluntarily

and uninvited, is treated as visitor only, and permitted to leave after

interview; U. S. v. Jensen, 432 F2d 861 (1970) (6th Cir.), good esample of

(F') SPEECH MATTE 'S -- I was most pleased to note another highly

productive year of public appearance accomplishments, including radio and

television appearances:

during 1970. Particularly gratifying is the fact

that most of the personal appearances were beiore quality audiences in rey

geographical areas. it is hoped that this lavorable trend will continue during

the current year and that all offices will remain alert for opportunities to

apprar before outstanding civic and service organizations, business and

-prr essional associations, veterans organizations and law enforcement groups.

It appears timely to reiterate the Bureau's long-standing policy

c diplomatically declining requests to appear before political groups of any

t se. These declinations should be handled tactfully to preclude any

embarrassment to or criticism of the Bureau. You are also reminded that

all speaking engagements must be confirmed to the Bureau in writing and that

the Bureau should promptly be advised of all scheduled commitments so that

Bureau records are up to date at all times. It is not desired that commitments,

including "Career Day" appearances, be reported on a delayed basis at the

end of the month with one communication. They should be reported as scheduled.

Preferably, a copy of the confirming letter should be sent to the

"ureau and, in those instances where you are recommening as a speaker

omeone other than the Special Agent in Charge, the Assistant Special Agent

in Charge, or a fully approved Bureau speaker, full justification for the

exception must be set forth on the Bureau's copy. These should not be

submitted on a "Unless Advised to the Contrary by the Bureau" basis and

sufficient advance notice should be provided to permit the Bureau to respond

with the requested approval. Once approval is granted, no additional notice

to the Bureau is needed.

I wish to also reiterate that only one credit can be granted, regardless

of whether a speech, or segments thereof, are additionally carried on television

and/or radio, whether "live" or taped. In such instances, one speech credit

pertaining to the initial event will be tabulated.

The Bureau continues to insist upon SAC leadership in this important

program with emphasis placed on reaching high-quality groups throughout the

various field office territories. Your accomplishments will be closely followed.

(G) SECURITY INFORMANTS - INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST;

NEW LEFT -- Effcctive immediately, captions of communications submitted

concerning security informants and sources involved in Communist Party, New

Left, and related security matters should include a precise character designation;

that is, the identity of the organization with which the source is most closely

associated or on which the source is most capable of furnishing information.

For example, if a New Left source is primarily associated with or

furnishes information on-Students for a Democratic-Society (SDS), the character-

of any communication dealing with the administrative handling of the source

would be "Security Matter - Students for a Democratic Society" or "SM - SDS. "

If the source primarily furnishes information on the Young Socialist Alliance

(YSA), the character would be "Security Matter - Young Socialist Alliance" or

"SM - YSA. "

Captions of communications in security informant and source matters

concerning the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA); or related organizations should

contain a character showing the organization with which the source is primarily

associated or on which the source primarily furnishes information. For example,

a communication concerning a Communist Party informant would bear the

aracter "Security Mattei - Communist" or "'SM - C. " . A Progressive Labor

warty (PLP) informant would be "Security Matter - Progressive Labor Party"

or "SM - PLP."

The above procedures will facilitate the handling of security informant

matters at the Seat of Government and should be strictly adhered to.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20595

January 22, 1971

Letter-to All Fingerprint Contributors:

RE: EXPUNGING ARREST DATA

Dear Sir:

There has been an increase in unnecessary correspondence

being sent direct to the FBI Identification Division concerning the

expungement of arrest data. Much of this correspondence has originated

with attorneys and court officials. In order that you can be thoroughly

familiar with our expungement procedures, we feel it desirable to

reiterate them at this time.

The FBI will return a fingerprint card showing a non-

Federal arrest when the law enforcement agency which submitted it

requests that this be done. In most instances this action results when

charges have been dismissed or subject has been acquitted. The request

for the return of fingerprints not only must emanate from the original

contributor but also must indicate sufficient identifying data such as FBI

number or registry number to insure the return of the correct fingerprint

card.

The FBI has no provision for keeping certain fingerprints

such as might be submitted on a juvenile in a separate or confidential

file. All arrest data furnished to us is available for dissemination to any

duly constituted law enforcement agency or agency of the government,

either local, state or Federal.

For example, if charges are dismissed or an individual is

found not guilty, we can retain the arrest fingerprint card you submit

and merely post final action as disnosition data.

this procedure, of

course, will result in the arrest data being quoted to anyone entitled to

receive it. On the other hand, you can request the return of the fingerprint

card and in this way it will be completely expunged and will not appear

in the individual's record.

Keep these procedures in mind and, whenever appropriate,

apprise your prosecuting and court officials of them. Subject or his

attorney should deal directly with you as we will only honor requests

for the return of fingerprint cards when such requests are made by the

contributing agency.

Very truly yours,

Kimon

B) TAX REFORM ACT OF 1969 - REVISED WITHHOLDING RATES AND

TABLES FOR 1971 - FEDERAL TAX -- The Tax Reform Act of 1969

provides for periodic adjustments in Federal tax withhoiding by use of

revised rates and tables. It has been determined that the income tax

withholding for wages paid during 1971 will not satisfy the final tax liability

for many wage earners, Accordingly employees should review their with-

holding tax and estimate their final tax liability for 1971 to ascerwin whether

it will be necessary for them to have additional Federal tax withhold from

their salaries. Tax must be withheld in accordance with the rates provided;

however extra tax may be withheld if authorized by the employee. This may

be done by submitting a new "Employee's Withholding Exemption Certificate"

(Form W-4) to the Bureau indicating the amount of extra l'ederal tax to be

withheld. The new Form W-4 must be filled out completely for all items

since it will supersede any Form W-4 presently on tile with the Burcau.

All employees in your office should be advised of the above.

(C) ELECTRONIC INTERCEPTION -- SAC LETTER 70-45 (B), dated

August 25, 1970, sets out the full text of that portion of Public Law

91-358, enacted July 29, 1970, which amends Title Il of the Omnibus

Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. These amendments became

effective Fcbruary 1, 1971, and provide that (1) it is not unlawiul for the

communications carrier to cooperate with law enforcement officers

authorized to intercept.wire or oral communications; (2) upon request of

the applicant, the court authorizing the interception may order tha

carrier to furnish necessary assistance; and (3) the carrier will not be

liable for acts performed in accordance with the order.

To carry out the purposes of these amendments, the Depart-

ment has instructed that the following language be used in applications

and orders for 'Title Ill intercepts:

pursuant to the power conferred on it by Section 2518(4)(e)

are to be intercepted, the furnishing of such facilities

or technical assistance by the (name of telephone company)

to be compensated for by the applicant at the prevailing

(Insert immediately above first proviso clause at end of order)

The Department advised that as a result of this change in the

law, the Bell System operating companies have revised their guidelines

relating to court-ordered interceptions and will honor a request for

assistance upon presentation of a court order. The company will not

retain a copy, but will make appropriate notations which will be

maintained under strict security. The company will provide the

necessary assistance which will usually take the form of furnishing a

private leased line and, if requested, cable and pair and multiple

appearance information. Additionally, where particular circumstances

necessitate, the company, on a selective basis, may provide central

office connection when leased lines are not adequate. Where required

they will furnish amplifiers, booster equipment, and any required

technical assistance. However, the guidelines do not contemplate the

presence or participation of telephone company personnel in the actual

installation of the equipment.

The Department stated that liaison is to be through the

telephone company's security organization and any difficulties

encountered either in obtaining assistance or which affect security

should be immediately brought to the attention of the Assistant Attorney

General, Criminal Division, for resolution. You are instructed to

immediately advise the Bureau of any such matters so that the

Department may be contacted. These instructions relate to the Bell

System and all independent telephone companies.

Advise all interested personnel.

(E) SECURITY INFORMANTS - JUDICIAL MATTERS -- Recently,

security informants have, during the course of developing information

concerning New Leit groups and individuals, been in cuntact with

individuals invoived in New Left activities who may be subjects of

criminal proceedings of their attorneys. Numerous New Left activists

have recently been involved in criminal activities which are violations

of either local or Federal laws.

Section 107 of the Manual of Instructions, page eight, notes

that when an incormant is requested by the Communist Party or other

interested partes to assist in preparation of detense in subversive-type

cases or handle assionments where such information is readily available,

informant should tactiully decline. If he cannot avoid becoming involved,

he is to be instructed not to report any information pertaining to defense

plans of stratogy.

The Department has concluded informants may be utilized in

furnishing information concerning the location of fugitives or location

of other individuals who may be involved in New Leit activities even

though sach utilization may result in an informant being placed in a

position where he may inadvertently learn of defense pians or strategy.

However, should the occasion arise when the informant is present in

conversation between an attorney and individual under criminal indictment,

he should immediately leave. If he is unable to do so, he is not to report

the substance of any such conversation to the FBI. Additionally, the

informant is not to engage in or report the subsiance oi a conversation

with a criminal deiendant dealing with the offense for which the defendant

is under indictment.

Such instructions, of course, are to apply to all security

informants and you should insure that all are aware of these instructions.

Security informants have been and will be utilized in Government

¿ ' proceedings against New Leît individuals who are the subjects of criminal

indictments. Generally, at the time these informants become witnesses

for the Government they are no longer being utilized by the FBI and

payments by us will no longer be forthcoming to the informant. To avoid

possible attacks on the credibility of security informants who are being

utilized as witnesses in Government proceedings, you should make no

promises to these informants concerning payment of funds by Department

as te relocation or subsistence. Such arrangements are, to be made between

these informants

and local United States Attorneys or the Department.

(F) SECURITI CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES - Existing procedure •

requires that a Special Agent hardling a regularly used security

confidential source, who is not being paid on Bureau authority or who

is not an employee of a foreign diplomatic establishment or

international organization, must dictate a memorandum to the

Special-Agent in Charge for the sourceis file containing the same

certification as to siability and reliability as required in payment

letters.

In order to save Agent and stenographic time necessary

in dictation and preparation of such memoranda, this procedure is

being changed. Bitective immediately, stability and reliability of

security confidential sources in categories previously requiring a

memorandum can be certified by executing the stability and reliability

statement appearing near the bottom of FD-209, which is regularly

used to record contacts with security informants and sources.

Certification should be recorded at intervals not longer than six

months. • Manual changes follow.

does not have the capability of determining when a particular

conversation has terminated and that a different conversation is

about to commence, monitoring may be reinstituted at intervals of

Legal Instructors: U.S. v. Antonelli, 434 E2d 335 (1970)(2d Cir.),

Miranda warnings not required by private citizens or security

personnel employea thereby wno take suspect into custody. Sutton v.

U.S., 131 F2d 462 (1970)(D.C. Cir.), a contrest in shirt colors does

not so taint a line-up as to violate due process.

Mitchell v. U.S.,

434 F2d 483 (1970)D.C. Cir. ), waiver of right to remain silent,

following Miranda warnings, may be implied. U.s. v. Gonzalez,

319 F. Supp. Sts (1970)(D. Conn.), during arrest of suspect in his

car at night, in a high crime area, it was reasonable for officers to

restrain and frisk the unknown passenger attempting to leave the car.

U.S. v. Harrison, 319 F Supp. 888 (1970)(D.C., N.J.), officers

lawfully presen in defendant's apartment to make arrest, and who saw

what appeared to be a pipe bomb, acted properly in immediately calling

for Army Bomb Disposal Unit. To require officers to first obtain search

warrant in such dangerous circumstances would be unreasonable. U.S. v.

(D) VOUCHER MATTER - REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION EXPENSES -

SALES AND/OR PURCHASE CONTRACTS - SETTLEMENT DATES -- I

has been noted there is a growing tendercy for transferred employees to

delay the start of negotiations for the sale and/or purchase of a residence.

As a result several employees have lost their eligibility to claim

reimbursement for certain real estate transaction expenses.

It is

therefore desired to reiterate existing regulations concerning this matter.

Initial contract for the purchase and/or sale of a residence

must be made, without exception, within one year from the effective date

of an employee's transfer in order for that employee to ciaim eligibility

for reimbursement for real estate transaction expenses. Normally final

settlement on the real estate must also be made within this one-year.

period. In certain limited cases an extension of time not in excess of

one additional year may be granted. However, before such extension can

be granted it must be clearly shown that the initial contact was entered

into within a reasonable time after the transfer was eftected and the final

settlement could not be made within the one-year period for reasons

beyond the employee's control. The General Accounting Office has advised

that financial inability of an employee to purchase a home is not an acceptable

reason to extend the final settlement bayond the initial one-year period.

This matter should be brought to the attention of all employees

in your office who are subject to transfer.

(E) INVESTIGATIONS OF WHITE BATE-TYEE ORGANIZATIONS - For

your information and future handling, investigitions involving captioned

matters arc now supervised by the internal Security Section of the

Domestic Intelligence Division. In order to more efficiently handle

and administrate work in this field, effective immediately captions

of all communications submitted concerning white hate-type matters

including informants should include a precise character designation,

that is, where known, the identity of the organization with which the

subject is most closely associated should be indicated. Where

organizational affiliation is not specifically delineated, the general

term "White Fate Group" shouid be utilized. Instructions set forth

in Manual of instructions, section 122, page 20, continue to apply

regarding organizations and individuals.

For example, if subject is primarily affiliated with Klan

or Klan-type groups,

the character utilized should be "Racial Matters -

Klan"' or "RM - Klan." Il subject is primarily involved with National

Socialist White People's Party, character should be "Racial Matters -

National Socialist White People's Party" Or "RM - NSWPP." If

- subject's primary organizational affiliation has not been specifically

determined, then the character "Racial Matters - White Hate Group"

or "RM - WHG" should be utilized.

These changes relate specifically to the handling of white

hate and related extremist groups. No change is being made in the

handling of black extremist groups. • The above procedures will

facilitate the handling of these matters at the Seat of Government and

should be strictly adhered to.

OFFICE OF AIR TRANSPORTATION SECURITY

AIR SECURITY BULLETIN 71-1

SUBJEGT: Procedures for the Safe Carriage of Weapons Aboard Aircraft

TO: All Air Carriers, Commercial Operators, and Law Enforcement Agencies

1.

PURPOSE. To further enhance

safcty and support the President's anti-

hijacking program through appropriate standardized procedures for

the carriage of weapons aboard aircraft.

2.

BACKGROUND. Sky marshals and certain other authorized persons may

carry weapons aboard aircraft in connection with their basic law

enforcement responsibilities or when competent authority has

determined the nature of a specific mission requires a person to

be armed. Although the valid carriage of weapons serves the public

• interest when proporly performed, the Federal Aviation Administration

(FAA) has found a lack of proper notification procedures which could

lead. to a serious compromise of safety, including the possibility

inadvertent confrontation between legally armed personnel.

3. OBJECTIVE. To insure that only authorized and properly identified

personnel are permitted to carry weapons aboard aircraft, and that

operators are advised sufficiently in advance to properly notify

cremembers and other armed personnel who may be on board the

flight.

4. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS BULLETIN:

a Operator - Means an air carrier or commercial operator carrying

passengers in air commerce.

b. Law Enforcement Authority - Means the appropriate law enforcement

authority or agency having jurisdiction over a person who is

authorized to carry weapons aboard an aircraft.

c.

Officer - Means a law enforcement officer or agent, military

law enforcement officer, or a security officer of the Federal

Government or the operator who is authorized by appropriate

authority to carry weapons aboard aircraft.

'M 55041. DocId: 32989525

Page 559

---

## Page 560

d. Sky Marshal - Means an armed deputized U. S. Marshal who is

especially trained to insurc in-flight security in the case of

a hijacking situation.

Responsible Representative of the Opcrator - Means the operator's

station manager or i designated member of the station manager's

staff; the duty supervisor in charge of passenger services; the

"duty supervisor in charge-of the passenger ticket-counter; or

a person specifically designated by the operator to handle the

carriage

of weapons aboard aircraft at the particular station

involved.

f. Carriage of Weapons Aboard Aircraft - Means carrying a firearm

on or about the person of a passenger on board an aircraft

including his carry-on baggage.

5.

GINERAL. Law enforcement authorities should strictly limit requests

for the carriage of weapons aboard aircraft to those situations which

require

an officer to be armed in-flight to insure the safe comple-

tion of his mission. The operator should inform each law enforcement

authority, who regularly uses the operator's service, of its

"i procedures for the carriage of weapons ahoard aircraft and the law

enforcement authority should insure this vital information reaches

the appropriate officers and other affected personnel under its

jurisdiction.

6. NOTIFICATION AND CHECK-IN PROCEDURES. Operator(s) and Law

-—

enforcement authority(s) should establish appropriate procedures

to insure the following:

a. Officers whose mission requires them to carry weapons aboard a

particular flight should so notify a responsible representative

of the operator as far in advance as practical, but in no case

less than one hour prior to scheduled departure. The notifica-

tion may be made in person or by telephone.

b. Except in the case of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

and the United States Secret Service (USS$), the law enforcement

authority should provide the officer with official orders, travel

orders or other appropriate documents which state the general

nature of the mission (escort, surveillance, travel, etc.) and

the need for the officer to be armed on the particular flight.

Due to the nature of their investigative and protective respon-

sibilities, the need for FBI and USSS agents to carry weapons

should be assumed.

NW 55041 DocId 32989525

Page 560

## Page 561

C.

d.

Officers

should identify themselves to a responsible represent-

ative of the operator in accordance with the operator's

procedures.

His identification credentials should include:

3

clear, full-face picture, his signature and the signature of a

responsible official of the law enforcement authority. A

badge, shield or similar device should not be used as

the sole

means of identification.

When not required on the particular flight, i.e., the outgoing

of return portion of a prisoner escort mission, weapons should

be carried unloaded in the officer's checked baggage.

e. The responsible representative of the operator should determine

whether or not the officer is familiar with the operator's

procedures for the carriage of weapons aboard aircraft, and

brief him accordingly.

7.

INTERNAL NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES. Once the officer has been satis-

factorily identificd and the validity of the mission confirmed to

a responsible representative of the operator:

do. He should be assigned a specific seat in the aircraft whenever

possible so that his seat location is kaums io the crewmembers

and other armed officers who are on board.

b. His name, law enforcement authority, the general nature of his

mission (escort, surveillance, travel, etc.), his seat location,

and the name and seat location of the person he is escorting,

if appropriate, should be forwarded immediately to the operator's

local station operations office to be included in the pilot in

command's preflight briefing material.

c.

The pilot in command should brief (or cause to be briefed) the

other appropriate crewmembers (including at least the senior

flight attendant) and sky marshals if assigned to the flight.

d.

The responsible representative of the operator should obtain

from the operations duty supervisor and provide the officer

with the number and seat location of the other armed personnel

(including sky marshals) who will be aboard the flight.

e. In the case of a valid emergency situation resulting in

notification and check-in after the preflight briefing

stated

in 7b above, the responsible representative of the operator

should personally deliver that information to the pilot in

command and, if appropriate, escort the officer aboard the

aircraft.

This also applies to an officer boarding at an

enroute station where the pilot in command remains aboard

the aircraft.

-WW-55041. DocId: 32989525

Page 561

## Page 562

f.

In the case of a through flight with a crew change enroute, a

responsible

representative of the operator should personally

determine whether or not armed officers or marshals are

through passengers and insure the new pilot in command is so

advised during the preflight briefing stated in 7b above.

WEAPONS CARRIED IN CHECKED BAGGAGE OR CONTAINER. The operator's

procedures should insure that a responsible representative of the

operator determines the

weapon is unloaded and the baggage or

container is carried in a cargo area or compartment not readily

accessible to passengers.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

Chemical weapons such as mace, tear gas, vomit gas, etc., are

not permitted on board passenger aircraft.

bo

The officer should carefully avoid inadvertent display of

weapons or associated equipment.

c.

d.

The operator's training programs and standardized procedures

should stress the need of employee respect for the officer's

anonymity on the ground and in flight.

It should normally not be necessary for the officer to further

identify himself or his mission to that operator once he has

complied with the conditions stated in section 7 above.

(A) BANK NIGHT DEPOSITORY TRAP DEVICES - REFERENCE FILE --

Looting of night depositories of banks through use of "trapping" devices

is increasing.

A device suspended in the depository chute "traps" deposits

which are retrieved by the thief when he removes his trap. Often the

trap falls into the night deposit vault where it is recovered. Recovered

devices have been forwarded to the Laboratory for examination where

photographs of several hundred are maintained.

The Laboratory has determined that usually a thief will re-

peatedly utilize the same design and type of materials in constructing

his devices. Accordingly, it is possible to connect such larcenies in

different cities and states through a comparison of the recovered devices.

A reference file of such devices is being prepared by the

Laboratory which will enable a rapid check of recovered devices and

disclose locations and dates where similar devices have been utilized.

• Identities of suspects previousiy utilizing simila derices will be mait

known to the fieid and the Identification Division where their fingerprints

may be compared with any latent prints developed on recovered devices.

Instruct investigative personnel assigned such cases to submit

all recovered devices to the Laboratory. In cases involving suspected

thefts from depositories in which a device is not recovered, furnish

available information to the Laboratory for checking with the reference

file to determine if any devices have been recovered in neighboring

Divisions within a pertinent time span.

(B) TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTION

The following significant decisions reported in March, 1971,

should be read by all Legal Instructors: U.S. V. De Lutro, 435 F2d

255

(1970)(2d Ciro), Fourth Amendment not violated when officers, with victim's

consent, secretly recorded conversation between victim and detendant.

U.S. v.'

Crisp: 435 E2d 354 (1970)(7th Cir.), once an accused has refused

to waive his Miranda rights, the officer must not attempt to persuade him-

otherwise. Miranda waiver may be made orally despite refusal to sign a

waiver form. Dorman v. U.S., 435 E2d 385 (1970)(D.C. Cir.), decision

shows exigent circumstances in which officers may enter dwelling at

night to arrest without warrant, and seize evidence in plain view.

U.S. v. Wilson, 435 F2d 403 (1970)(D.C. Cir.), immediate identification

controntation of arrested accused by victim upheld. Young v. U.S., 435

F2d 405 (1970)(D.C. Cir.), on reasonable grounds an oiricer may temporarily

detain a vehicle and its passengers for brief interrogation even when

probable cause for arrest is absent. Gun in plain view may be taken

for protection of officer.

Example of unduly suggestive lineup.

U.S. v. Akin, 435 F2d 1011 (1970)(5th Cir.), interview of suspect by FBI

Agents in Bureuu car held not custodial for Miranda purposes. Musgrove v.

Eyman, 435 F2d 1235 (1271)(9th Cir.), report oi previously untested

informant, plus independent verification by officers, supplies probable

cause. Officer may seize contraband in plain view from place where he

is lawfully present. U.S. V. Briddle, 436 F2d 4 (1970)(8th Cir.), officers

making lawful arrest in apartment may conduct cursory search of apartment

for other persons as a security measure. Contraband in plain view during

search may be seized. U.S. v. Jackson, 436 E2d 39 (1970)(9th Cir.),

court upheld confession given to ofticers on second interview four days

after accused had refused to waive Miranda rights. U.S. v. Hilliker,

436 F2d 101 (1970)(9th Cir.), Miranda waiver need not be in writing

or explicit orally; it may be implied irom circumstances. U.S. v. Gaines

436 F2d 150 (1970)(D.C. Cir.), when accurate identification of accused

may be in doubt, formal identification procedure (lineup) should be

arranged promptly. U.S. V. Gantor, 436 F2d 364 (1970)(7th Cir.),

Miranda does not require express waiver of counsel. Kirby v. Cox,

435 F2d 684 (1970)(4th Cir.), search of vehicle incidental to arrest therein

may be temporarily delayed while officer awaits reinforcements to take

the prisoner. U.S. V. Case, 435 E2d 766(1970)(7th Cir.), a locked

hallway in a building complex is not a public place. Police surveillance

there without warrant violates Fourth Amendment. U.S. v. Lipscomb,

435 F2d 795 (1970)(5th Cir.), key found on subject during search of

person at jail after arrest may be tried on suspect vehicle found in parking

lot of motel where arrest made. U.S. v. Drew, 436 E2d 529 (1970)(5th Cir.),

in absence of statement detailing manner in which informant obtained his

information, his tip remains viable if it describes criminal activity of

the accused in sufficient detail that officer may know that informant is

relying on more than casual rumor or the general reputation of the accused.

U.S. V. Beale. 436 E2d 573 (1971)(5th Cir. (now on appeal,_ entry of

dwelling by arresting officers using ruse or deception violates statute

requiring notice oi authority and purpose, even when entry is without force.

U.S. v. Brown: 436 F2d 702 (1970)(9th Cir.), any well founded suspicion of

criminal concuct will justify brief detention of suspect or limited inquiry

in routine investigation even when probable cause for arrest is absent.

See also U.S. V. Harflinger, 436 F2d 928 (1970)(8th Cir.). U.S. v. Sacco, .

436 E2d 780 (1970)(2d Cir.), a thief's "possessory interest" in stolen

goods seized from the premises of another does not give the thief standing

to complain of the search and seizure. U.S. v. Harflinger, 436 E2d 928

(1970)(8th Cir.), officer's lawful discovery of gun under seat of car of

arrest entitied him to search trunk for more weapons. Stamps v. U.S.,

436 F2d 1059 (1971)(9th Cir.), officers who have lawfully announced authority

and purpose may conclude that entry has been aenied, and thus break doors

to enter, on hearing commotion within and footsteps running away.

• U.S. v.

Williams, 436 E2d 1166 (1970)(9th Cir.), defendant has no con-

stitutional right to an in court lineup, and no right to counsel at post-

arrest display of photos to witnesses, but Government should not attempt

,, to influence witness testimony by photo display shortly before trial.

U.S. V. Boyd, 436 E2d 1203 (1971)(5th Cir.), items found in routine

police station inventory search of car belonging to person arrested

therein are admissible in evidence. U.S. V. Hoffa, 437 F2d 11 (1971)

(6th Cir.), concealing tape recorder in informant's car with his

consent to record preindictment conversation with defendant is awful.

U.S. v. Garcia Mendez, 437 F2d 85 (1971)(5th Cir.), where officers

making arrest in house knew that defendant was in bed and had revolver

within reach, the officers were entitled to break in without announcing

authority and purpose. U.S. v. York, 321 F. Supp. 539 (1970), decision

shows the factors to consider in determining whether photographic identi-

fication is proper. U.S. V. Sullivan, 321 F. Supp. 597 (1971), apartment

tenant's consent to search of apartment, given by executing written form,

was voluntary despite fact that it was given to four officers in hallway

(D) COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY -- The Secure Teletype System (STS)

is utilized by all field offices and the Bureau for the transmission of

automatically coded teletype messages and security of transmitted mes-

are through use of the AFSAM 7 code machine, or interoffice cipher pads,

to encode messages.

The telephone is the least secure of all Bureau communications

facilities. When utilizing telephone facilities to make long distance calls,

or telephone calls outside of secure Bureau space, extreme care must be

exercised and material of a highly confidential, sensitive nature should

not be discussed.

These instructions should be brought to the attention of all

personnel with specific emphasis on the necessity of exercising caution

as to subject matter discussed telephonically.

(E) REPORT WRITING - UNDESIRABLE TRENDS REGARDING INCLU-

SION OF NONESSENTIAL REPRODUCED MATERIAL - It has been noted

that there is an ever-increasing tendency on the part of the field to

include en bioc in reports large amounts of mechanically reproduced

material not essential to the report. Examples of this practice are

telephone toll records which have not been analyzed for patterns or trends

and from which no leads have been set forth; documents and paraphernalia

seized in scarches by-both Bureau and outside agencies; documents obtained

by subpoena; Xeroxed copies of Title III affidavits, compiaints, warrants,

indictments and verbatim transcripts; credit card invoices, bills of

lading and shipping documents; material, such as business and identification

cards, found on the person of an arrested subject.

In many instances the problem of en bloc inclusion of this

material in a report is compounded by the fact that much of it is of

marginal legibility. The Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part Il,

Section 4B. 8, Page 3, states, "All copies of communications must be

legible."

The en bloc inclusion of this type material has in many

instances required numerous pages of an investigative report, and while

in many instances this material is necessary to an investigation, it

usually adds only limited information to a report and its excessive bulk

only serves to confuse and obliterate the essential investigative findings -

which are contained in the report. The massive nature of much of this

material also involves a high cost factor due to expenses incurred in

reproduction, mailing, handling and file storage.

Material of the type cited should more properly be filed as

a serial or in the exhibits section of the Field Office file and only a suc-

cinct summary of pertinent facts derived from the source material should

be reported in the details of an investigative report. Where copies of

the material are needed or desired by a United States Attorney or other

agency they could be reproduced as necessary and forwarded by a separate

cover letter.

It has also been noted that in many instances when affidavits

are forwarded to the Bureau in support of a Title III electronic surveil-

lance application, the affidavits have attachments or enclosures which

4-27-71

SAC LETTER 71-17

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 568

## Page 569

are not clearly denoted. When material or documents are submitted as

an enclosure or attachment to a Title Ill aifidavit they should be clearly

marked and each page appropriately numbered at the bottom; the affidavit

should also be so numbered.

By explicitly following current instructions as reiterated

herein, the savings to the Bureau in cost and space factors will be con-

siderable and Bureau reports will have more utility in their primary

purpose of succinctly setting forth the facts of a particular violation or

situation.

The Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 4D. 2,

Page 16, states in part regarding details of reports, "The details shall

be accurate statements of essential facts. They shall be written in

logical sequence and in a clear, concise, and complete manner."

The inclusion of en bloc reproduced materials as previously

indicated does not meet the criteria of essential information, reported

in a clear and concise manner. Such material should not be included as

part of an investigative report unless there is a compelling reason for its

inclusion, and then only with appropriate justification in Administrative

pages.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.G. 20535

May 1, 1971

(A) NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY ACT (NBA) - EXTENSION OF IMMUNITY --

The Department has issued instructions to U. S. Attorneys concerning

its analysis of Title Il of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. This

title extends the automatic immunity under Section 7 (a) (testimony of

bankrupt at the first meeting of the creditors) to include "any evidence

which is directly or indirectly derived from such testimony." The

immunity under this act extends only to the individual bankrupt, or the

person designated to represent the bankrupt corporation, and not to other

witnesses. This will bar the use of any leads developed from such testimony.

-

The Department observed that the Supreme Court may hold

that this immunity may extend to the bankrupt's testimony at the 21 (a)

hearing.

It has been so held by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals,

reasoning that the 21 (a) hearing is a continuation of the 7 (a) hearing;

therefore, effective immediately, the 7 (a) testimony of the bankrupt, or

of the person designated to testily for a bankrupi curpuraiion, shouid nui

be reviewed in the course of criminal bankruptcy investigation. Decision

to review 21 (a) testimony should be considered in individual cases and

no review should be undertaken in absence of concurrence of the U. S.

-

Attorney.

Close co-operation between the Bankruptcy Court, the U. S.

" Attorneys and FBI is called for to avoid tainting any criminal investigation

or prosecution. To this end, a referral procedure has been developed

by the Department whereunder the Bankrupicy Court will restrict access

to the bankrupt's testimony and direct that all who witness any immunized

testimony, oral or written, make no disclosures concerning same in event

of interview.

The Department's analysis provides that the U. S. Attorney

apprise the Referee of those investigations instituted on the basis of infor-

mation derived from sources other than the Referee or bankruptcy pro-

ceedings, in order that Referee may institute these safeguards. It is,

therefore, incumbent upon you to appropriately apprise the U. S. Attorney

when NBA investigations are instituted on information received from

In those instances where the only evidence of criminality

is developed in the bankrupt's testimony, the Referee will refer case to

U. S. Attorney without reference to such information. A limited inves-

tigation will be conducted by the FBI to determine if there is independent

evidence upon which to predicate full investigation.

The foregoing pertains to criminal investigations and will

not affect civil-type investigations requested by U. S. Attorney to enable

him to oppose bankrupt's discharge. The Department's instructions are

contained in Department of Justice Memorandum No. 744, dated April 6,

1971, a copy of which is being furnished, under separate cover, to each

office. Assure all investigative and supervisory personnel having respon-

(B) SECTION 105 - MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS - Bureau has prepared

updated and streamlined version of Section 105 which was distributed with

manual revisions of March 30, 1971. All Agents assigned to security matters

should carefully review the new chapter.

The new section has been greatly shortened by eliminating excess

wording and combining similar or nearly identical passages from different

subsections. Slight difterences in policy or criteria for investigation

relating to similar-type cases have been eliminated. We have also adopted

uniform policies with respect to the handling of communist immigrants,

repatriates, visitors, and ofticials.

Brief subsections have been added covering the need for type-

writing and handwriting samples of intelligence subjects, the type of visas

issued by State Department, and describing the TRAMUS (Tracing of Communist

Funds) Program.

The material in this chapter has also been compartmentalized

for convenience in locating policy relating to a particular subject matter.

Heretofore all data relating to immigrants, repatriates, and visitors was

combined in one lengthy subsection. This has now been split into three

different subsections for convenience. Similarly, information relating to

officials, couriers, contacts and the DESECO program has been all carried

as one very lengthy and somewhat confusing subsection. In streamlined version

these topics have been placed under separate headings.

(C) INFORMANT DESICNATIONS - SECURITY OF RESDENT AGENCIES --

Effectively immediately, Bureau is discontinuing practice of including

asterisk to designate highly sensitive informants: Do not include asterisk

in reporting information in the future from such sources.

• •:

This action is bring taken as result of public surfacing of this

practice as an outgrowth of burglary of various Bureau documents from

Media, Pennsjivania, Resident Agency.

Media incident has also underscored need to afford sensitive

FBI sources maximum protection possible in our correspondence. This

applies not only to symbol number informants, but to nonsymbol sources

of some sensitivity, such as telephone company employees, school

officials, bank representatives, hospital employees, or in certain instances

even Government representatives such as an official of a local draît board.

Unless there is definite and compelling need to identify such sources by

name in interotice correspondence, their specific identities should not

be shown on copies of communications to other uffices. Actual identity

of such persons is rarely needed by auxiliary offices and in most instances

they, can be described in such general terms as "a well-piaced source"

or "a knowledgeable source in a position to have information of this type."

Specific identity of the source should, of course, be shown on file copy

of communication maintained in originating office along with any other

documentation needed, such as Agent receiving information and date received.

To prohibit any future arbitrary destruction of any communication which

represents the sole record of an informant's identity, the file copy of

communication containing such information should be clearly and plainly

marked to show it must not be destroyed without prior Bureau authority.

If it is essential to include specific identities of such sources

in interoffice communications, their names should be set forth on a spearate

page or pages under the caption "Administrative" and such pages must be

detached prior to routing the communication to a Resident Agency.

A symbol number designation should be afforded to all individuals

from the time any step is taken to develop them as any type of Bureau source,

including informants, potential (or probationary) informants, confidential

sources and panel sources regardless of the status of their development.

Any such current sources under deveiopment should immcdiately be given

5-4-71

SAC LETTER 71-19

NW-55041-DocId:32989525 Page 574

---.

symbol numbers and, where appropriate, the Bureau advised. Names of

informants and potential informants should not be set forth in interoffice

correspondence reporting substantive data from such sources except where

absolutely necessary, such as in setting out leads to secure necessary

background information from auxiliary offices. Such correspondence should

include name but not

i symbol number of source. The only communication

setting forth both name and symbol number of source should be the initial

correspondence to the Bureau identifying a potential security or criminal

informant. For maximum security, this communication should be in

every case by secure teletype.

Manual changes forthcoming.

John Edgar Hoover

(C) RESTRICTION ON USE OF FACSIVILE XEROX TELECOPIER -

SECURITY OF FBI INFORMATION --

Bureau letter to Albany, with copy to all oifices, dated

March 23, 1971, captioned "Communications - Facsimile Xerox 400

Telecopier, " clearly instructed that facsimile transmissions must be

considered "Plaintext" unless material is first encoded on the AFSAM-7.

Facsimile transmission provides more privacy than plaintext teletype

or telephone calls since anyone attempting to intercept traffic would hear

only unintelligible tone signals and to read the transmission would have

to know what type of equipment is used and record signals for piayback

through identical unit.

However, the facsimile does not approach the

full security available through our secure teletype system (STS).

Referenced Bureau letter clearly stated that the telecopier

is to serve primarily as a backup for our sts.

...- In spite of these instructions, however, there have been

instances where the field has transmitted by telecopier teletypes

containing data which should be sent by STS or encoded by AFSAM-7

when STS is inoperative. Offices have concealed sources in the main

text of teletypes and identified the source under the Administrative

Section. This was the proper manner to prepare a teletype where the

information is subject to being disseminated at the Bureau. However,

when identity of a source requires concealment, this is suificient justi-

fication to use STS or off-line coding equipment since this data will be

classified. This is accomplished by indicating that the message should

• be sent in code.

In the cases mentioned above, the dictator indicated that

the teletype should be sent by plaintext and the supervisor approved

it in this manner. The sending operator then obviously relied on the

dictating Agent and approving supervisor to properly indicate the manner

in which the teletype should be sent.

It is the responsibility of the dictating Agent to inform the

stenographer whether a telctype should be sent in plaintext or code.

Good judgment must prevail, but it should be borne in mind that all

teletypes containing classified information should be sent coded. Also,

any information which could compromise a Bureau source, or which

5/11/71

SAC LETTER 71-20

WW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 577

## Page 578

could jeopardize a Bureau investigation or cause embarrassment to the

Bureau should be encoded. Personnel matters or other sensitive

administrative matters should likewise be encoded. In other words,

the consequences of Bureau data falling into unauthorized hands should

-be the primary consideration for determining-whether-to-send a teletype-

by code or plaintext.

You are also again reminded that whenever information

being submitted by teletype may be of interest to other Government

agencies at Seat of Government, instructions set forth in Part II,

Section 4, Page 41-46, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations must

be followed. It is important to remember that in such instances when

the field sends a teletype via STS, the Bureau teletype unit prepares

a simultaneous perforated tape which can be used for immediate

retransmittal to other Government agencies. For this reason, all

teletypes being prepared for possible dissemination at the Bureau

must be sent by teletype, not telecopier, regardless of classification

or other consideration.

You should immediately implement necessary administra-

tive procedures to insure that there is no misuse of telecopier equipment.

Failure to follow these instructions will result in administrative action

being taken against both Agent and supervisory personnel.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director .

(C) YOUNG AMERICAN MEDALS FOR BRAVERY AND SERVICE,

NOMINATIONS FOR 1970 --

The Attorney General has recently requested the

Governors of all the states and territories and the Mayor of the •

District of Columbia to submit nominations for the above awards.

The final date for submission of-nominations is July 30, 1971. It

is necessary that all nominations be accompanied by complete

documentation concerning the actions of the nominees for consider-

ation.

Offices covering State Capitals should bring this

program to the attention of appropriate officials when contacting

them on other matters. They shouid be advised that all nominations

must be made through the Governor of the individual state to the

Honorable Richard G. Kleindienst, Deputy Attorney General, Department

of Justice. Additional background information concerning these

awards is included in the May issue of the FBI Law Enforcement

Bulietin.

A total of 33 nominations were made by state Governors

for Young American Mecials Awards for 1969. The Governors of 11

states made 27 nominations for the bravery award and the Governors

of four states made six nominations for the service award. It

would, therefore, appear that not all worthy candidates are being

brought to the attention of the committee for consideration for

the awards. Accordingly, you should bring this program to the

attention of all investigative personnel in your office and they should

be instructed to be alert for any worthy candidates that may come

to their attention during their normal contacts with police and

other officials.

(E) FIREARMS - USE OF PERSONALLY OWNED SIDE ARMS BY

SPECIAL AGENTS - FBI FORM BOOK -

Effective 30 days from the date of this letter, all authoriza-

tions previously given Special Agents to carry personally owned handguns on

official business are reseinded. We must tighten the rules, regulations-and

training procedures relative to non-Bureau weapons. Within the next 30 days,

those Agents desiring to carry a personally owned side arm meeting Bureau

standards must reapply to you for permission and their requests should be

forwarded to the Bureau on Form FD-431.

Only personally owned handguns of the same type as the Bureau

revolver issued to Agents, or which have been provided to the field for official

use, will be approved. The revolver must be of at least. 38 Special caliber,

have at least a five-shot capacity, and must contain the same safety features

as Bureau-issued handguns. Agents currently having approval to carry per-

sonally owned revoivers meeting the above specifications but with an alloy

frame may reapply for authorization to carry the weagon, but future requests

for authorization iu carry such revolvers will be donica.

It has been deter

mined that revolvers with alloy frames are not as durable as steel-framed

weapons during regular training usage.

When an Agent requests authority to carry a personally owned

revolver on official business, it should be inspected by you or a firearms

expert. I the wearon meets the above standards and you approve the request,

Form FD-431 should be executed in triplicate. Two copies should be forwarded

to the Bureau and one copy placed in the requesting Agent's field personnel

file. If the request is approved by the Eureau, one copy will be so marked

and returned to you. Upon receipt of Bureau approval, the form should be

routed to your Principal Firearms Expert who will have the responsibility

of insuring that the Agent uses the approved personally owned side arm during

at least 50 percent of the revolver training courses during cutdoor and indoor

firearms training each calendar year. Date of Bureau approval should be

recorded on copy of Form FD-431 in Agent's field personnel file and descrip-

tion of personally owned revolver should be recorded on Agent's property

card. A supply of revised Form FD-431 will be furnished to you separately.

The . 38 Super and . 45 automatics in the field offices for police

training purposes should not be issued to Agents for official use.

All approved personally owned revolvers must be inspected by

a firearms expert at least once annually and such weapons must be brought

to Quantico by Agents when attending In-Service for inspection by a gunsmith

and for use during fircarms training.

(F) SPECIAL AGENT RECRUITMENT - DRAFT DEFERMENT MATTERS --

As you have been advised, applicants for the Special Agent

position under age 26 with an unfulfilled Selective Service obligation and

subject to possible induction but who have a valid occupational deferment

(IL-A) based on employment in a field unrelated to law enforcement may

be considered for processing if the Local Draft Board will favorably con-

sider continuing such deferment on appointment to the Special Agent posi-

tion.

However, the Bureau has been advised that the selective

Service System for the States of New York, Nebraska, and Ohio follow a

policy of not continuing Il-A deferments where occupational changes occur.

Therefore, applicants for the Special Agent position from those states who

are under age 26, have unfulfilled Selective Service obligation and a low

lottery number indicating possible induction, are not to be processed. if

he would otherwise be favorably considered.

inform applicant he may

reapply at such time as he is no longer subject to possible induction or

when his military obligation has been satisfied. Pertinent papers are,

of course, to be furnished to the Bureau.

You may also continue to consider applicants where the

Local Draft Board advises chances of induction are extremely remote

--

because of age (26 or over - national policy is not to induct registrants

in this age group) or who possess a high lottery number not likely to be

reached for induction. The Bureau has been advised that where regis-

trant is age 26 or over or assigned a lottery number not likely to be

reached that the Local Draft Board is to hold any requests to be con-

tinued in a deferred classification in abeyance on the theory there is

little likelihood of being called for induction. When discussing whether

II-A classification will be continued if appointed to Special Agent posi-

tion, insure applicant's age and lottery number are considered.

(G) REPORTING MATTER - PROTECTION OF RACIAL AND SECURITY

INFORMANTS -- Your attention is called to Sections 107 and 130 of the

Manual of Instructions and Section 4, Part Il of the Manual of Rules and

Regulations in which detailed procedures are set forth concerning the

protection of our confidential informants in reporting racial and security

matters. I wish to reiterate and stress that you must exercise utmost

care in the preparation of communications for dissemination in order to

avoid identification of or cast suspicion on our informants. Information

received from confidential sources must be carefully paraphrased and

set forth in a manner designed to fully protect the identity.of the source.

Extraneous information, especially that which tends to pinpoint the source,

must be eliminated. You should be guided by the knowledge that inef-

fective protection of an informant's identity may place his life in jeopardy:

The above instructions are also applicable in reporting data from

highly sensitive sources. You should avoid any wording which suggests

the nature of these sources.

All Ageut personnel should ba reminded of those instructions

and you should personally follow this matter to insure strict compliance.

(H) RACIAL MATTERS - CHANGE IN NUMBER OF REPORTS AND

LETTERHEAD MEMORANDA FORWARDED TO BUREAU - Experience

has demonstrated that the number of copies of reports and letterhead

memoranda being forwarded to the Bureau concerning investigations of

individual black nationalists and concerning racial riots and disturbances

should be reduced at this time. Effective immediately, you should only

forward five copies of such communications to the Bureau in investigations

of individual black nationalists and eight copies of letterhead memoranda

pertaining to racial riots and disturbances.

There is no change regarding the number of copies of reports

or letterhead memoranda to be forwarded the Bureau concerning investi-

gations of black nationalist organizations. Manual and Handbook changes

follow.

(C) "FRIENDS OF THE FBI" -- For your information, an

organization known as "Friends of the FBI" was recently formed

by a group of individuals including a prominent Chicago, Illinois,

attorney and a Washington, D. C., public relations man as a self-

described "grass roots" effort to support the Bureau and me in the

face of recent criticism.

It has been determined that Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., has

agreed to serve as Honorary Chairman and in this connection a form

letter bearing his facsimile signature has been mailed to various

individuals across the country setting forth the goals of this

organization and soliciting funds.

You are advised that "Friends of the FBI" is a private

enterprise initiated by the aforementioned individuals and formed

without the Bureau's knowledge, encouragement, or approval.

Although Mr. Zimbalist affiliated himself with it as its Honorary

Chairman without the Bureau's knowleage, he did so as a private

citizen who has the best interests of the Bureau at heart.

Should you receive any inquiries concerning this

organization or its activities, you should respond with this reply:

"The FBI has no connection or relationship of any kind with a recently

formed group calling itself 'Friends of the FBI.'"'

(D) INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

(ITSMV) INVESTIGATIONS -- SAC Letter 70-33 dated June 16, 1970,

Paragraph (A), contained instructions concerning moditications in

the handling of ITSMV cases. The procedures were effective July 1,

1970, on a one-yenr trial basis and-are now being made permanent.

Since the effective date of the above modifications, there

has been a decline in the over-all case load, as well as the accomplish-

ments in the ITSMV category. This trend has been attributed to the i

restrictive Departmental prosecutive policy. Your office must insure *

that violations within the jurisdiction of the FBI are promptly referred

to you. This can be brought about by effective liaison with local law

. enforcement agencies and sources.

To this end, an immediate

examination should be made by you to ascertain whether all ITSMV

violations are being promptly referred. This should be a continuing

program if we are to carry out our responsibilities under the law.

It is expected each office will initiate such action as is necessary

in order to accomplish these objectives.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(A) CLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION -- There has been an increase

in classified mail submitted by Burcau offices. In many instances the

classifications do not meet the criteria set out in Executive Order 10501.

Classified information is defined as official information the

protection of which is necessary in the interest of national defense and

which is protectively classifica for that purpose by appropriate classifying

authority. Note the reason for classifying material must be hinged on

national defense.

The reason for classification of Bureau mail should make

specific reference to national defense interests. For example, "Top

Secret"' is to be used only to protect that information or material the

defense aspect of which is paramount and the unauthorized disclosure

of which could result in excentionally grave damage io the Nation, such

as leading to a break in diplomate relations, an armed attacis against the

United States or the compromise of defense plans, intelligence operations

or scientific developments vital to the national defense. "Secret" should

be utilized only for defense information or material, the unauthorized

disclosure of which could result in serious damage to the Nation.

"Confidential" is to be used only for deiense intormacion or material,

the unauthorized disclosure of which could be prejudicial to the defense

interest of the Nation. Where it is necessary to classily intormation, the

lowest classification consistent with its proper protection should be

used. It is essential that unnecessary classification or over-classification

be avoided.

It has been noted many documents are classified merely be-

cause information was obtained from informants. In some instances this

information relates to public rallies, demonstrations or meetings and

the relcase of the information could in no way compromise the informant.

While protection of valuable informants and techniques is essential,

information obtained through them should be carefully evaluated to

determine whether classification of the information meets the criteria

7/6/71

SAC LETTER 71-30

wt.!

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 590

## Page 591

set out in Executive Order 10501. In this connection you should refer

to page 55, paragraph five, Section 4, Part II of the Manual of Rules

and Regulations. In each instance where such information is classified,

you must indicate the reasons for the classification.

Do not classify information merely to prevent embarrassment

to the Bureau or to lessen the likelihood it will be published. Classifi-

cation must be based on the criteria set out above.

Classification of mail will be closely followed at the Bureau.

and will be looked into during inspections. You will be held responsible

for improper or unnecessary classification.

(B) ARTIST'S CONCEPTIONS - FACSIMILE - XEROX 400 TELECOPIER --

The Xerox 400 Telecopier has been successfully utilized for a trial period

to transmit artist's conception requests and drawings between Bureau and

selected field offices.

Effective immediately, all offices and resident agencies having

Telecopier equipment should consider using this method to transmit requests

•for artist's conceptions. Requests should be dialed directly to Exhibits

Section on FTS 202-343-9148. Agent who prepares FD-383 should be

availabie when possible during transmittal to clarify or elaborate on

information secured from the witness by talking directly with the artist.

Completed drawing will be transmitted to requesting office by Telecopier.

Modifications to drawing may be handled in same manner. Field requests

should be transmitted between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., EDT.

-

The facsimile received by field will be 8 in. x 10 1/2 in. size

suitable for copying by Polaroid camera or other local photographic facilities.

Offices receiving artist's conception via Telecopier should always make a

photographic copy to insure its permanency for file and future reference.

The Facial Identification Catalog will still serve as the basic

source of reference for facial characteristics io be noted on FD-333.

Supplemental pages recently forwarded to all ofrices show examples of

contemporary hair and beard styles. Additional mug shots or graphic

material in your possession which will aid artist should be transmitted via

Telecopier with your request. The Telecopier can also be used to request

trial charts when transmittal of field sketches and diagrams is essential

but time does not permit the usual methods of communication. All

investigative personnel should be advised.

(D) INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS MATTERS -

Reference

is made to paragraph D, SAC Letter 69-21, dated April 1, 1969.

The Department has advised of an important change in its

policy to be followed in handling captioned matters. U. S. Attorneys

now have full authority to initiate prosecution or forfeiture and to

request further investigation upon completion of our preliminary

investigation in these matters. Formerly, upon receipt of complaint

of a possible violation, facts were furnished to U. S. Attorney

concerned and he could authorize only a limited, preliminary

investigation and offer his advice as to merits of case. Criminal

Division requested full field investigations and authorized prosecutions.

Prior Departmental authorization is no longer required.

The fifteen-day deadline for submission of reports is

rescinded; however, the field is to continue to promptly notify Bureau

by airtel or by more expeditious means, if good judgment so dictates,

of receipt of complaint and action or lack of action desired by U. S.

Attorney.:

(A) LAW ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM - GRANTS AND

LOANS -- SAC Letter 69-31 (B) dated June 24, 1969, advised of

basic information concerning financial aid in the form of grants and

Toans as provided by the Omnibus Crine Control and Safe Streets Act

of 1968. This financial aid is administered by the Law Enforcement

Assistance Administration (LEAA), Department of Justice, through

the participating schoois. Changes in regulations have been issued by

the LEAA as follows: Grants - effective July 1, 1971, only officers of

Federal agencies having primary criminal law enforcement or

correctional responsibilities relating to the national crime problem

are eligible. No supportive personnel are eligible. Accordingly, only

Bureau Special Agents are now eligible for such grants. Loans -

applicants for such aid are required to secure a letter from a criminal

justice agency to be directed to the school applicant is attending indicating

that if the loan applicant passes all the necessary tests and meets all

other qualifications for employment, the agency would willingly consider

him as a desirable candidate for employment in the "criminal justice"

field. The Bureau's principal "criminal justice" position is that of

Special Agent. This letter is not a commitment to actually employ the

loan applicant in such position. Any employee applying for a Law

Enforcement Education Program loan must submit his request for above-

type letter to his Division Head stating whether his objective is to apply ..

, for the Special Agent position. The identity of the person at the school

including title and specific address with postal zip code number to whom

such a letter should be directed must also be furnished. The Division Head

will forward the request to the Bureau, attention Personnel Section, with

an appropriate recommendation as to whether the letter should be furnished.

The Bureau will consider requests for such letters only for current Bureau

employees. Should any former employees or individuals with no prior

Bureau association request such a letter, they are to be informed we are

unable to comply with their request for an "employability letter." A

record is to be kept of any such requests and in the case of former

employees, pertinent intormation is to be furnished to the Bureau for

inclusion in their personnel file.

(B) TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTION - The following instructive

Federal decisions reported in July, 1971, should be read by all Legal

Instructors: U.S. v. Edwards, 141 I2d 749 (1971)(5th Cir.), court

uphola officer's searcir ot venicle from which driver fled aiter high-

speed chase apparently involving traffic violations only. The

contraband found was admissible. U.S. v. Fuller, 441 F2d 755

(1971)(5th Cir.), decision shows text of approved FBI affidavit for

search warrant in gambling case. Agents lawfully executing search

warrant in gambling premises may answer bookmaker's telephones,

give the gambling "line" information to customers, and testify to such

calls. U.S. v. Buonomo, 441 E2d 922 (1971)(7th Cir.), intormant

described only as having given reliable information in the past, was

held reliable because affidavit revealed circumstances of informant's

knowledge of crime in this case. In executing search warrant,

officers may seize recognized instrumentalities not mentioned in

search warrant. V.S. v. Stuckey, 441. F2d 1104 (1971)(3d Cir.),

implied waiver of Miranda rights upheld where subject was fully

advised in writing, rerused to sign waiver form, but then willingly

discussed the case. U.S. V. Gaines, 441 F2d 1122 (1971)(2d Cir.),

valid consent to search jacket was given when suspect, asked by

officers for identification, pointed to jacket on coatrack ten feet away

in his residence and said,

"It is in my jacket." Frazier v. Roberts,

441 F2d 1224 (1971)(0th Cir.), decision explains why a state search

warrant based on sworn oral testimony satisfies requirement of 4th

Amendment but identical Federal warrant does not.

Piazzola v.

Watkins, 442 EZd 284 (1971) (5th Cir.), student occupying room in

college dormitory has 4th Amendment protection against unreasonable

searches and seizures by law enforcement ofticers. Russell v. Cox,

326 I Supp. 27 (1971), officer investigating report of accident

involving armed man had right to frisk suspect on finding him in

vicinity. U.S. v. Marotta, 326 F. Supp. 377 (1971), when person

arrested in his home locates and surrenders evidence therein to the

officers in résponse to their order to do so, there is no valid consent

to search. U.S. v. Swede, 325 F. Supp. 533 (1971), customs officers

may make a lawiul and warrantless "border" search of a package

received in the mail from a foreign country on less information than the

probable cause nceded for a warrant to search domestic mail.

(C) DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION - I have been concerned for

some time over unnecessary dissemination, and current conditions

involving the saleguarding of information have made this matter an

even greater problem.

It is not Bureau policy to refuse to disseminate vital and

important information to which other agencies, including local law

enforcement, are justifiably entitled; however, good judgment and

common sense dictate that the need to disseminate must be both vital

and important and within the scope of present requirements to do so.

Care must be taken not to withhold any information the retention of

which might result in embarrassment to the Bureau; however, there

must be no indiscriminate or arbitrary dissemination, and if a

douht arises the matter must be brought to the attention of a super-

visory official.

Insure that appropriate personnel are fully cognizant of

these instructions.

(D) COMMUNIST PARTY, USA - 20TH NATIONAL CONVENTION -- Tho

Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), plans. to hold its 20th National

Convention February 11-14, 1972, in New York City. Prion to the

National Convention, the various districts will hold conventions to elect

delegates for the National Convention and prepare resolutions to be

• presented at the National Convention. Delegates are to be selected on

the basis of one deiegate for each district, plus one delegate for every

20 members or portion thereof up to 100 members; one delegate for

every 25 members over 100 up to 300; and one delegate for every 30

members over 300. "Members" referred to above means dues-paying

members, which figures are to be compiled on the basis of dues contiol

period from September-November, 1971. The CPUSA expects 175-200

delegates to attend the 20th National Convention.

Identification of these delegates is essential and should

provide an indication of the number of dues-paying members in each

district. Special efforts must be made to determine exactly where

the 20th National Convention will be held in New York City, details of

resolutions prepared in each district, and how delegates will vote on

controversial issues at the National Convention.

Each office must

instruct informants to be alert to obtain the desired information. This

matter must receive your closest attention. Bureau and New York

must be kept currently advised of pertinent developments. Offices

covering cities where district conventions will be held must insure

appropriate coverage is provided to establish the information needed

to fulfill our responsibilities. At the conclusion of each district

convention, submit results to Bureau and New York in form suitable

for dissemination.

(E) STUDENT AGITATION ON CAMPUSES - During the past school

year, September, 1970, to May, 1971, there was substantial campus

unrest; however, it did not reach the magnitude of the preceding year.

It is evident that the campuses of this country still harbor a large

number of militant activists who are striving to foment a communistic

or anarchistic revolution in this country. With the extension of the

voting rights to persons aged 18, it should be apparent that these

forces will step up political agitation on campuses. Another factor

that may influence future campus unrest is the publication oi the

so-called "Pentagon Papers." These papers are being used by

militants and radicals as justification in calling for a violent

revolution in the United States.

In view of the above, it is imperative that each office

insure that the Bureau is kept abreast of student agitation and

subversive activities on each campus in its territory. You should

also make certain that you obtain all specific information concerning

student agitation which

is available through public source material.

• There are numerous publications available which report on the

activities of student agitators. These publications should not be

overlooked as sources of definitive information through which

agitators and their planned demonstrations can be identified and

followed for potential vioiations of the laws under the Bureau's

jurisdiction.

You are reminded that the Bureau is not interested in

legitimate dissent or routine activity on campuses. Intormation

• from the above sources on student agitation must be promptly

submitted in form suitable for dissemination in order that the

Bureau can fulfill its obligations in the security field.

John Edgar Hoover

An asterisk adjacent to an entry denotes the office has a

suggestion awaiting final decision. The Legat Offices in Beirut, Caracas,

Copenhagen, La Paz, Managua and Tel Aviv commenced operations in

December, 1970.

The total number of suggestions submitted was 955 of.*

which 318 were adopted with three (3) still awaiting final decision.

Nineteen (19) suggestions from previous years were implemented

during Fiscal Year 1971 making the actual total of adoptions 337.

Estimated first-year tangible savings amounted to almost $110, 000.

Thirty-five employees shared in incentive awards totaling $4955 and,

in addition, 15 more were commended for their contributions.

I wish to express my appreciation for the fine spirit

of cooperation and interest displayed by our personnel in achieving

these results. The continued enthusiastic support and participation

by all of our employees will be vitally necessary in helping the Bureau

discharge the ever-increasing responsibilities with which it is

entrusted during Fiscal Year 1972.

(B) REMISSION OR MITIGATION OF FORFEITURES - Title 18, United

States Code, Section 1955(d), authorizes seizure and forfeiture of any

property used in an iliegal gambling business. Departmental Order. 453-71;

dated February 2, 1971, empowers FBI Agents to make such seizures.

Bureau policy in this regard is contained in Volume 4, Section 142, Manual

of Instructions.

You should be aware that when the interest of a third party,

such as a mortgagee or other lienholder, is adversely affected by seizure

and forfeiture of personal property, the third party may file with the United

States Attorney in the district where the seizure occurs, a petition for

remission or mitigation of forfeiture. 28 C.F.P.. 9.1-9.7. 35 F.R. 7013.

Departmental Order 430-70 (April 21, 1970). Upon receipt of a petition,

the United States Attorney will direct the seizing agency to investigate the

merits of the petition and submit a report thereon to him. 28 C. F.R. 9.3(b).

Therefore, FBI investigative responsibility does not necessarily terminate

with the arrest of a gambler and the seizure of his property. In those cases

where third parties have a legal interest in the property, particularly in

situations involving seized motor vehicles, the United States Attorney may

request field offices to conduct further investigation.

In order for a petitioner to justify remission or mitigation of

forfeiture, he must (1) establish a valid, good-faith interest in the seized

property, and (2) establish that at no time did he know or have reason to

believe the property in which he asserts an interest would be used in violation

of law. In addition, where the petitioner acquired his interest in the prop-

erty by dealing with a person who in fact had a criminal record or reputation

for gambling violations, Departmental Order 430-70 imposes a further

requirement. In such cases, the petitioner must show that he made in-

quiry as to the person's criminal record or reputation at the local law

enforcement agency prior to the petitioner acquiring his interest or such

other person acquiring his right to the property and was informed that the

person had no criminal record or reputation with that agency. For example,

a company financing the purchase of a vehicle and holding a lien thereon,

when seeking relief under the Departmental Order, must demonstrate that

before credit was extended, a check of t'le borrower was made at the local

law enforcement agency. Failure to make such inquiry may bar the petitioner

from relief under the Departmental Order. 28 C.F.R. 9.5.

Requests to investigate the merits of petitions for remission or

mitigation of forfeiture should be brought to the attention of the Bureau.

Investigations should be closely coordinated with the United States Attorney.

(C) FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT -- In view of the limitations

imposed by captioned law, information requested of consumer

reporting agencies will be restricted to (1) identifying information

(name, address, former addresses, place of employment, and

former places of employment) wnich may be obtained in any case

and (2) consumer reports, which may be obtained for employment

purposes on the applicant alone in applicant-type investigations and

where the Bureau has a legitimate business need for the information

such as Ascertaining Financial Ability cases.

When reporting information obtained from a consumer

report, the source of the data shoula be clearly identified as a

consumer reporting agency. Subsequent use of such information

contained in Bureau files is prohibited except for the purposes

authorized by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. See detailed analysis

of the Act in SAC Letter 70-67 (A) dated December 1, 1970.

Consumer reporting agency contract matters including

whether a waiver need be signed by applicants in employment cases

will be handled on a case-by-case basis as such problems arise.

Continue the present practice of submitting your proposals in these

matters for review at the Bureau.

Advise all investigative personnel of these changes.

character Racial Matters is no longer pertinent to these types of

organizations use Extremist Matters - (group name); for unaffiliated

black extremists use Extremist Matters - Black Nationalist; for the

Klan use Extremist Matters - Klan; for other white-hate organizations

use Extremist Matters - (group name); for unaffiliated white extremists

use Extremist Matters - White Hate. As to those matters formerly

carried under the character Racial Matters, such as distrubances and

riots, you will now use the character Civil Unrest.

The designation of racial informants should be changed as

follows: racial informants to extremist informants, probationary

racial informants to probationary extremist informants, and racial

ghetto informants to extremist ghetto informants.

As to Bureau-approved forms bearing the designation

racial, these changes will be made as the forms are due for printing;

and distribution will be made accordingly.

The Racial Intelligence Section of the Domestic Intelligence

Division will now be known as the Extremist Intelligence Section; and

accordingly, the field divisions having a Racial Squad should change the

name to Extremist Squad.

(E) SECURITY FLASH NOTICES REGARDING SECURITY INDEX

SUBJECTS -- In order to assure that continuous future arrest information

maintained by the FBI Identification Division is disseminated to the field

on those individuals who are Security index subjects on whom no finger-

prints are on file with the Identification Division, a Security Flash Notice

(FD-165) should be submitted periodically. This will enable the field to

determine if fingerprints of the subject have been received by the

Identification Division since the last check and, if so, to have a stop

placed in the fingerprint record to assure that the field is advised of all

subsequent submissions.

The period of submission of the FD-165 should be on a

staggered basis and at different intervals. Priority I, Security Index,

subject requests should be submitted every six months commencing

with the submission of an annual report and every six months thereafter.

In the case of Priority II and Priority IM. Security Index, subjects,

requests should be submitted on an annual basis in conjunction with the

submission of the annual report or annual verification of residence and

employment.

The periodic requirement would be satisfied upon notification

by the Identification Division of a fingerprint record on the subject and

the placing of a stop against such record or upon removal of a subject

from the Security Index.

This follow-up procedure does not relieve the field of the

responsibility of making every effort to obtain fingerprints of Security-

Index subjects locally when such prints are not on file in the Identification

Division. In this regard, you should bear in mind that fingerprint cards

• of arrested persons are not always submitted to the Identification Division

by local authorities. Therefore, local authorities may have fingerprints

of a particular Security Index subject when such prints are not available

in the files of the Identification Division.

In conjunction with the Bureau's sensitive investigations,

particularly on arrest-prone individuals who are frequently on the move,

it should be continuously porne in mind that the records of the FBI

Identification Division can be an important investigative aid and such

records should be eifectively utilized. However, these identification

files are of little value unless fingerprints of the Security Index subject

are on file in the Identification Division in view of the propensity for

this type of individual to use fictitious names when arrested.

Appropriate manual changes are being made.

(F) PROTEST ACTIVITY AND CIVIL DISTURBANCES - A review of

recent communications submitted by field offices relating to student

agitation, antiwar activities, and racial incidents reveals some offices

have failed in their initial communications to identify sponsors of

demonstrations or groups precipitating disorders. It is realized that

under some circumstances this is due to the fact that the sponsoring

group is of an ad hoe nature and, therefore, there is little background

information available. In other instances, particularly relating to racial

incidents and student agitation, demonstrations or

disorders erupt

spontaneously based upon some specific triggering event. Even in these

cases, however, existing groups will more frequently take the lead in

sponsoring the protests. You are reminded that despite the foregoing, it

is imperative that initial communications set out the sponsors of demon-

strations or specifically note that spontaneous groups or ad hoc

organizations are involved.

You are reminded that it is necessary to furnish the Bureau

with follow-up information regarding cancellations of demonstrations or

their failure to materizlize where the Eureau has previously been alerted

was .to.the scheduling of such events.

If a demonstration takes place as

scheduled, the Bureau should be advised in accordance with existing

instructions. If it is cancelled of rescheduled, this information should

be reported to the Bureau by teletype. Bear in mind that interested agencies

of Government often inquire concerning such proposed events.

--

Teletypes must be promptly submitted in a form suitable for

dissemination with an absolute minimum of editing. These should contain

• a concise characterization or description of any organization mentioned.

This is absolutely necessary so that the Bureau can properly and

intelligently disseminate the information.

In connection with the above instructions, you should review

Bureau letter to Albany dated August 28, 1970, captioned "Student Agitation,

Antiwar Activity, and Racial Incidents. "

On an increasing basis, a trend has been noted wherein

old-line revolutionary groups, such as the Progressive Labor Party,

Socialist Workers Party, and Communist Party, USA, along with their

youth groups, are sponsoring demonstrations protesting various aspects

of this country's domestic activity.

You should remain alert to these activities and promptly

In any type of mass activity (conference, rock festival, and

so förth) which is scheduled to take place in your territory, the

potential for violence or civil disturbance should be assessed and

where such a potential is felt to exist, the Bureau should be furnished

with background information in order that it will be knowledgeable

should inquiries be received from other Government agencies.

(B) SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS - CHANGE IN CHARACTER --

SAC Letter 71-35 (D), 7/27/71, revised character designations rela-

tive to security investigations which will facilitate routing of mail at

the Bureau. In connection with these changes, the character "Security

Matter - Anarchist"' was eliminated and "Security Matter - New Left"

was added. Manual of Instructions, Section 87G, page 37, is being

revised to eliminate "Anarchist" from and add "New-Left" to the list

of organizational affiliations of Security Index subjects..

When in the course of business an FD 122 is next submitted

reporting a change of employment, address, etc., relative to a Security

Index subject whose organization is listed as "Anarchist," the FD 122

should also recommend a change in the organizational altiliation. Such

a case should be thoroughly reviewed at that time and the most logical

organizational aifiliation listed. It does rot necessarily follow that

the organizational affiliation should be the same as the character of the

case. For example, if the character of a case is "Security Matter -

National University Conference (NUC)" the organizational affiliation

for Security Index purposes would be "New Left."

(A) SPECIAL ACCIDENT AND TRAVEL INSURANCE (SATI) -

PREMIUM PAYMENTS THROUGH PATROLL ALLOTMENT - OPEN

ENFOLLMENT SEASON THROUGIT 9/80/71=-

The SATI insurance program is divided into three plans: Long

Term Disability Benefit Plan; Accidental Death, Dismemberment and

Permanent Total Disability Flan; and Accident Indemnification Plan.

An employee may join the last two plans at any time since benefit pay-

ments are based on accidental causes. However, one may only enroll

in the Long Term Disability Benefit Plan the first 30 days following

entry on duty. Otherwise, employee must undergo a physical examina-

tion to show medical evidence of insurability. Employees may now make

premium payments for all three SATI insurnce pians through convenient

payroll allotment by execution of Standard Form 1198.

"A list of currently insured employees assigned to your office

together with a supply of SATI brochures (with attached Standard Form

1198) will be forwarded your office by 9/8/71. Insured employees who

desire to change over to the payroll aliotment system must file new

applications indicating desired amounts of insurance coverage and

execute attached Standard Form 1198. Insured employees who so

desire, and, those employees who already have two payroll allotments

(maximum allowable) may make premium payments through monthly

coupon booklets mailed direct to SATI Administrator. Insured employees

who enrolled during the original registration period, March, 1970, and

who paid a premium deposit need not make a September, 1971, payment

as the deposit will cover this period.

Premium payment through payroll

allotment is not only more convenient but also preciudes possibility of

loss of coverage due to individual lapse in payment. It will also result

in a 2 1/2% reduction in rate of cost for the Accidental Death, Dismem-

berment, and Permanent Total Disability Plan.

(B) STOP NOTICES -- In the future, there will be no need to prepare

Stop Notice cards on individuals or items which are entered in the National

Crime Information Center provided this is the only stop which has been

placed. This will not change the policy with respect to stops placed with

agencies, other establishments, or those which do not meet the necessary

criteria for entering them in the National Crime Inforination Center.

During the nest quarterly review of Stop Notices, those which meet the

above requirement should be destroyed and those which reflect an item

suitable for entry should be entered and the card then destroyed. If

some reason exists to justify the retention of the Stop Notice after entry

into the National Crime Information Center, this should be so indicated

on the card. The case Agent will be responsible for determining whether

a Stop Notice should be prepared in each instance.

TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTION --

The following instructive Federal decisions reported in

August, 1971, Should ba read by all Legal instructors: U.S. ex rel.

Dunham v. Cuinlan, 327 F. Supp. 115 (1971), fact that person is under

arrest and in jail does not of itself make involuntary his consent to

search of his dwelling. Sexton v. Gibbs, 327 F. Supp. 134 (1970),

arrest without probable cause. U.s. Y. smith, 4c4 ind 440(1911),

no violation of deiendant's righi to privacy where pouce outicer in

codefendant's apartment with codetendant secreted himself in back

room, with codefendant's permission, to listen to incriminating con-

versation between defendant and codeiendant. U.S. v. Manakan, 442

EZd 619 (1971)(7n Cir.), Oinicer standing on cucic siuewalk and looking

through window of defendant's garage at night, with aid of flashlight,

does not violate defendant's right to privacy.

U.s. V. Mojica, 442 F2d

through all portions jointly controlled. J.s. v. -ahler, sea Fra 11T2

(1971)(9th Cir.), "hearsay upon hearsay" may ve usea in affidavit for

search warrant.

When informant is victim of the offense, his reliability

for affidavit need not be corroborated by other facis. Photograph can

be instrumentality of crime. U.S. V. Biswell, 442 F2d 1189 (1971)

(10th Cir.), provision of Federal Gun Control Act, 18 USC 923(g),

allowing certain oîticers to enter private premises of firearms and ammu-

nitions dealer for inspection purposes, without search warrant, is in

violation of Fourth Amendment. U.S. v. Johnson, 442 F2d 1239 (1971)

(D.C.), officer making valid arrest for tramie violation has right to

require driver to get out and to maise protective frisk for weapons.

Contraband of different offense then seen in plain view in vehicle

justifies arrest for second offense. U.S. ex rel. Dutienzo v. Yeager,

413 F2d 228 (1971)(3d Cir.), accomplice vuo conesses against own

instead of seizing it at point of first discovery. U.S. ex rel. Cronan v.

Mancusi, 444 F2d 51 (1971)(2d Cir.), fact that suspect was suitering from

severe gunshot wound at the moment did not necessarily make him incapable

of giving a voluntary confession. U.S. V. Edwards, 441 F2d 122 (1971)

received from the Civil Service Commission concerning processing of

--

within-grade increases during the freeze. The Bureau will continue to

process within-grade increases as heretofore, with the exception, of

course, that actual monetary increases cannot be granted because of the

freeze.

Employees are orcinarily notified of a within-grade increase

through intormation on their statement of earnings. During the freeze,

employees certified for within-grade increases will be notified of same

via a copy of Form 3-542 directed to them. The new salary will be shown

but will be asterisked, and the following explanation will be shown under

"Remarks": "Employee will be paid the 'Old Salary' shown above until

salary stabilization period directed by Executive Order 11615 is terminated."

This is being furnished for your information should you rcceive any inquiry

as to processing of within-grade increases. As Forms 3-542 on employees

are received in your office, they should be appropriately distributed.

(C) INTERSTATE TRANSFORTATION OF STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

(ITSMV) MATTERS - ACCOLPLISFLIENTS - At the close of the first

two months of Fiscal Year 1972, there was a 12% deficit in the number

of automobiles recovered throughout the Bureau, as compared with the

same period in Fiscal Year 1971.

You should immediately examine your liaison with local law

enforcement agencies and other sources of ITSMV matters to insure that

all stolen vehicles recovered from out of state, which have not been

entered in NCIC, are reported to your office. All personnel assigned to

these cases should be instructed to particularly re-evaluate their liaison

with automobile auctions, car dealers, informants, police agencies,

storage garages, et cetera, to make absolutely sure all stolen vehicles

from out of state are being promptly referred to them and are being

promptly reported to the Bureau as recoveries in line with current Bureau

instructions.

• In Fiscal 1971 there was a substantial drop in ITSMV convictions.

The restrictive effect of the Departmental prosecutive guidelines places

an added responsibility on your office to give prosecutable cases prompt,

vigorous attention. Such cases should be immediately and thoroughly

discussed with United States Attorneys and their prosecution closely followed

and reported.

increased demonstrations and protest activity developing on the occasion

of the travel of the President, the use of the code word "TROPUS" is

being broadened to include communications reporting on demonstrations

and protest activity relating to the appearance of the President. An

appropriate caption should include the following phrase or one similar

thereto: Demonstration in Connection with the Appearance of the President,

OPERATIONS - The U. S. Postal Service has recently assumed the respon-

sibility of prov.ing security protection for Federal courtrcoms housed in

Postal buildings and for the upgrading of the general security of major Postal

facilities throughout the country. Enforcement of security regulations on

Postal property has been assigned to a newly formed protective organization

called the U. S. Postal Service Security Force, a function of the Postal

Inspection Service.

- At the request of the Postal-Service, the Bureau has-agreed to

provide the Postal Inspection Service, Washington, D.C., with intelligence

information on civil disorders, demonstrations and activities of extremist

and revolutionary-oriented organizations as they may affect Postal operations.

In addition, Postal inspection Service representatives at the local level are

to be notified by FBI field oifices of impending disruptive actions at Postal

facilities in their areas.

In accordance with this, you are to be alert to the receipt of .

information concerning planned demonstrations or civil disorders at

Postal facilities in your territories, particularly those having Federal

courtrooms. Promptly furnish this and other information which could

affect Postal operations to the local offices of the Postal Inspection

Service.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

October 19, 1971

(A) VOUCHER MATTER - REVISION STANDARDIZED GOVERNMENT

TRAVEL REGULATIONS -- There is enclosed a copy of revised

Standardized Government Travel Regulations, Office of Management and

Budget Circular Number A-7, dated August 17, 1971. The effective date

for the implementation of these revised regulations for Bureau personel

will be November 1, 1971. An additional supply of Circular Number A-7.

will be forwarded to you in the near future.

The majority of the revisions in the travel regulations are

for clarification only. There are, however, major changes to (1) mode

of transportation for official travel; (2) reimbursement for use of a

- personally owned automobile (POA); (3) calculation of per diem; and

• (1) amount of per diem. These changes are set forth below:

(1) Mode of transportation for official travel - Travel is to •

be performed by the most expeditious and economical mode. Therefore,

generally travel will be by coach airline accommodations unless

circumstances exist which would make this impractical or disadvantageous

to the Government. This will prohibit travel by train or boat in most

instances. Whenever travel is by automobile, train, boat, etc., the

pertinent voucher claiming reimbursement must be supported by statement

which clearly shows that the mode of transportation was necessary or to

the advantage of the Bureau. Any excess costs resulting from personal

• desires to travel by a particular mode must be borne by the employee.

This does not atfect the use of Bureau cars on official business or prohibit

the use of POA on transfers or otherwise if the best interest of the Bureau

is baing served.

(2) Reimbursement for use of a POA - Whenever a POA is used

10-19-71

SAC LETTER 71-51

ANW 55041 DocId: 32989525

Page 618

---

## Page 619

on official travel, other than that incidental to transfers the mileage rate

allowed has been increased to $. 11 when it is determined that use of such

POA is most advantageous to the Bureau. The $. 11 rate is also to be used

when a POA is used in lieu of common carrier.

However, the cost to the

Government in this situation is_limited to.what the cost would have been had..

the most economical public transportation been used. Other existing Bureau

regulations regarding the use of POA for official travel are not changed.

It is pointed out that it has been determined that the mileage rates of $. 09

and S. 05 for the use of POA set forth in the attached regulations are not

applicable to Bureau personnel. There has been no change in the POA rates

on transfers.

(3) Calculation of Per Diem - Computation of per diem, when

common carrier is used, has previously been computed on the basis of the

arrival and departure time of the common carrier. The revised regulations

provide that such computations will be based on the arrival and departure

from home or office, whichever is pertinent. This corresponds to the

present method of computing per diem where an automobile is used and

makes uniform the computation of per diem regardless of the mode of

travel. For travel performed by common carrier after November 1, 1971,

it will be necessary to show on the reimbursement voucher the departure

time from home or office, the scheduled departure time of the common

carrier, and the distance in miles between the home or office and the common

carrier terminal. On the return to point of assignment it will be necessary

to show the arrival time of the common carrier, the arrival time at home

or office, and the distance between the terminal or office.

(4) Amount of Per Diem - Revised regulations provide that

for official travel within the continental United States where lodging is

required per diem is to be fixed partly on the basis for the average cost

for lodging plus a suitable allowance for meals and miscellaneous expenses.

The rate for meals and miscellaneous expenses has been administratively

set at $12. The total amount of the average daily cost for lodging for the

voucher period plus the $12 rate for meals and miscellaneous expenses

rounded off to the next whole dollar will be the employee's per diem

rate for the period covered by the voucher provided such total does not

exceed the maximum rate of $25. If such total does exceed the $25 rate

10-19-71

SAC LETTER 71-51.

2 -

NW 55041 DoOId: 32989525 Page 619

---

## Page 620

then the $25 rate will be applicable. In support of any claim for per diem

where lodging is involved, it will be necessary that paid receipts for

lodging be submitted with the appropriate reimbursement voucher.

In those instances where no lodging is required the per diem

will be computed at the rate of $12 per day or $3 per quarter-day. On

transfers where spouse and/or children are traveling with the employee

per diem will be computed for the employee on the basis of what the

average "single" rate for the rooms for lodging would have been, plus

the $12 (not to exceed the $25 limitation). In such instances it will

be necessary for paid receipts for lodging to show the "single" rate.

Rates for the spouse and other family members will be computed in

accordance with present regulations, i.e., three-fourths of employee's

rate for the spouse, etc.

The Office of Management and Budget advised on

: October 6, 1971, that as a result of the President's 90-day freeze on wages

and prices, the increased mileage rate for use of POA as described in

Item 2 and the procedure for calculation of per diem described in Item 3

above cannot be implemented at this time.

This means that until the

freeze is removed the mileage rate for use of a POA for official travel ..

(other than incidental to a transfer) will remain at $ . 10 per mile and

when travel is performed by common carrier per diem will continue to be

computed on the basis of the arrival and departure time of the common

carrier. You will be advised when authorization is received which will

permit the implementation of these two items. Items 1 and 4 are not

involved and will go into effect November 1, 1971.

These revised regulations should be immediately brought

to the attention of all employees in your office who perform official

travel. Manual changes will be forthcoming.

(B) FINES, SAVINGS AND RECOVERIES -- Fines, savings and recoveries

during the first three months of the current fiscal year are 22% below the

amount recorded during the same period of Fiscal Year 1971. Although

automobiles recovered and Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property

matters contribute substantially to recoveries, various civil cases account

for the largest portion of savings and recoveries. The classifications of

such civil cases are Federal Tort Claims Act, Admiralty Matters, —

Ascertaining Financial Ability, Miscellaneous - Civil Suits, Court of

Claims and Renegotiation Act. Investigations of these classifications of

cases are requested by U. S. Attorneys and by the Civil Division of the

Department of Justice.

Regular contact is maintained by the Bureau with the Civil

Division concerning these matters and in order that the Bureau will meet

its responsibilities in these matters, all offices are instructed to contact

their respective U. S. Attorneys within two weeks and to maintain regular

contact thereafter for the purpose of insuring that all civil matters within

our investigative jurisdiction with potential savings and recoveries are

referred for investigative attention and that such matters receive prompt.

and thorough investigative attention.

Each office is also instructed to advise the Bureau within three

weeks as to the results of the initial contact with the U. S. Attorney and

as to the total potential savings and recoveries each office expects to

record by 12/31/71, as well as by 6/30/72. Those offices continuing to

show a decrease in fines, savings and recoveries will be followed on a

monthly basis to assure every effort is being made to improve that

situation.

(C) SPECIAL CLERK PROGRAM - The grades in the Special Clerk

Program range from grade GS 5 to GS 7 with grade GS 7 the full performance

fill a vacancy in the program, the grade of the vacancy should be that

(D) URBAN GUERRILLA WARFARE ACTIVITY - It is incumbent on

this Bureau to determine the extent of urban guerrilla terrorism in the

U. S. and to identify New Lcft and extremist groups and individuals

involved. Revolutionaries are engaging in: robberies indicative of

urban guerrilla expropriation activity; thefts of weapons, especially military

weapons; thefts of dynamite or other explosives appropriate for bomb

manufacture; bombings against revolutionary-type targets; attacks on and

ambushes of police; incendiary attacks against Government buildings, police

facilities, colleges, corporations that are black extremist or New Left

targets; and airplane hijackings. Exampies of these actions in the U. S.

last year can be found in the FBI Special Report, "1970: Year of the Urban

Guerrilla, " furnished each office. Whether Federal or local offenses are

involved, this Bureau must assess the urban guerrilia internal security threat.

In connection with the occurrence of any of the above, or any

incident that might appear to be urban guerrilla warfare-type action, a

separate communication should be submitted wherein a complete assessment

is made as to whether or not the incident was in any way involved with

extremist matters or New Left activity. In instances where a Bureau

violation is involved, one communication with a dual character to include

"Extremist Matters--Possible Urban Guerrilla Activities" or "New Left_

Movement--Violence--Possible Urban Guerrilla Activities" should be

used and extra copy submitted. If no Bureau violation is apparent, but

indications of urban guerrilla activity are present, open a case to

consider whether a preliminary inquiry should be conducted to determine

if extremist or New Left elements are involved. Advise Bureau under

descriptive caption and appropriate character, adding "Possible Urban

Guerrilla Activity, " of investigation contemplated.

In addition, informants and sources should be syecifically

targeted to determine whether any terrorist-type groups are operating

within your division. To determine the extent of this activity in the U. S.,

each office is to submit an airtel summary, by the tenth of the month, of

all incidents within the division for the previous month that appear to be

urban guerrilla activity. Caption this summary "Possible Urban

Guerrilla Activity, Research Matter. "

SAC Letter 70-18, dated 4/7/70, item (e) captioned "New

followed except the captions used in paragraph four should conform

with those used above.

Insure that there is a close coordination with local police and

between Special Agents-working-criminal and extremist matters so that all

indications of urban guerrilla terrorism are developed, reported, and

investigated. The Bureau must take the initiative in preventing the rise

in any Tupamaro-type guerrilla bands seeking to impose a reign of urban

terror in this country.

RE: TECHNICAL COORDINATOR

With the recent intensification in investigations utilizing

provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of

1968, as amended, there has been a marked increase from the field

for requests for Title III installations. Each of these requests requires

technical support equipment. In order to meet our commitments in

these matters and to facilitate the efficient use of essential equipment,

the following instructions are set forth:

1. Each Special Agent in Charge should designate one

sound-trained Agent as Technical Coordinator and should notify the

Bureau, attention Radio Engineering Section, FBi idvoratory, when

this has been done.

2. The Technical Coordinator will have prime responsibility

for requesting technical equipment and supplies from the Bureau ac-

-

cording to the needs of your office. In this regard, field supervisory

personnel should insure that the Technical Coordinator is made aware

of all proposed applications for Title Ill installations as soon as they

come under consideration. In this way, the Technical Coordinato,

or someone acting for him, will have ample time to plan the installation

intelligently, to seek; technical advice from the Laboratory, if neces-

sary, and to request equipment for the job.

3. At the conclusion of each Title III installation, you should

advise the Bureau, attention Radio Engineering Section, of this fact.

This communication should clcarly state the number of lines which were

involved and should itemize the specific equipment used, by serial

number. There should follow a statement to the effeci that the equip-

ment is or is not available for transfer to another office. It is assumed

that any equipment available for transfer will be in good working order.

Any equipment which is not in good order should be repaired orreturned

to the Laboratory prompily for repair. Your office may exempt certain

## Page 625

equipment from being available for transfer only if there is an immediate

need for its reuse. Your letter should be specific in those instances

where authority for the retention of equipment is being sought.

4. Within 15 days after receipt of this letter, your Technical

•Coordinator should furnish the Bureau, attention Radio Engineering

Section of the Laboratory, an itemized list of technical equipment (of

the type used in connection with Title III interceptions) which is not

presently being used and state whether the equipment is available for

reassignment.

WASHINGTON, D.G. 20535

December 28, 1971

(A), AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTI

GATION AND 'THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING

PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES - Reference is made to SAC Letter

65-10, dated March 9, 1965, which forwarded a copy of the "Agreement

Between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service

Concerning Presidential Frotection, " dated February 3, 1965. This

agreement is reviewed annually by both agencies. It was last revised

July 27, 1966, to incorporate FBI responsibilities under the Presidential

Assassination Statute (Title 18, Section 1751, United States Code).

Secret Service has now prepared a complete revision of the

agreement because of "thät agency's much broader protective

responsibilities which now include not only protection of the President

but also protection of certain other persons including visiting heads of

state and protection of certain foreign diplomatic establishments.

The

new agreement entitled "Agreement Between the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and the United States Secret Service Concerning Protective

Responsibilitics, " dated November 25, 1971, has been signed by the

Director of the FBI and the United States Secret Service. It supersedes

all prior agreements. A copy of the new agreement is attached for your

review. You will note that the basic changes in the agreement pertain

to Secret Service's enlarged protective responsibilities and to a

description of the types of information Secret Service desires to receive

from the Bureau to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities. The new

agreement also includes a reference to the provision in Public Law

90-331 wherein the Secret Service may request that FBI Agents be

detailed to Secret Service in order to augment the capacity of Secret

Service to perform its protective duties. In accordance with our

established procedures, the new agreement states that Secret Service

should direct any requests for such assistance to the Director of the

FBI at Headquarters level.

The new agreement should be carefully reviewed by all

supervisory and investigative personnel. Appropriate Manual and

Handbook changes are being prepared, and FD-376 is being revised.

type (usually a nitel).

As a result of reviews recently completed at the Seat of

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

AND THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE

CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

*

I. Purpose of Agreement

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) maintains the most

comprehensive files in the United States on subversive organizations

and individuals, and on actual, alleged, possible, or potential

criminal violations by individuals. The FBI originates, and receives

from other sources, large numbers of reports on individuals and

organizations. One purpose of this agreement is to define that

portion of the information on file with, or received or originated by, —

the FBI, which the United States Secret Service (USSS) desires to

receive in connection with its protective responsibilities.

The USSS has statutory authority to protect, or to engage in certain

activities to protect, the President and certain other persons.

(Certain other persons, as used in this agreement, refers to those

persons protected by the Secret Service under Title 18, U. S. Code,

Section 3056; and Public Law 90-331). The authority of the USSS to

protect the President can be interpreted to authorize it to investigate

subversive organizations and individuals who might constitute a threat

to the President. The FBI has statutory authority to investigate

assault, killing or kidnapping and attempts or conspiracies to kill

or kidnap the President of other designated individuals.

The FBI also has general jurisdiction in this country over subversion

against the United States and will make available to the USSS informa-

tion it may request or information which by its nature reveals a

definite or possible threat to the President's safety.

A second purpose of this agreement is to insure the most effective

• protection for the President by establishing a clear division of

responsibility between the duties of the FBI and the USSS. Such

division will also

avoid compromises of investigations or sources

and needless duplication of effort.

II.

General Responsibilities

The USSS is charged by Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056,

with the responsibility of protecting the person of the President of

the United States, the members of his immediate family, the

President-elect, the Vice President or other officer next in the order

lifetime and the person of a widow of a former President until her.

death or remarriage,

and minor children of a former President.

until they reach 16 years of age, unless such protection is declined;

protecting persons who aru desi mined from time to time by the

Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Advisory

Committee, as being major Presidential and Vice Presidential

candidates who should receive such protection (unless the candidate

has declined such protection); protecting the person of a visiting head

--

of a foreign state or foreign government and, at the direction of the

: President, other distinguished foreign visitors to the United States

and official representatives of the United States performing special

missions abroad (unless such persons decline protection).

The Executive Protective Service (formerly the White House Police),

under the direction of the Director, USSS, is charged by Title 3,

U.S. Code, Sections 202-208, with protection of the Executive

Mansion and grounds in the District of Columbia; any building in which

Presidential offices are located; foreign diplomatic missions located

-

diplomatic missions located in such other areas in the United States,

its territories and possessions, as-the-President, -on-a-case-by-case-

basis, may direct.

The FBI is charged under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751, with

investigative jurisdiction of the assault, killing of kidnapping, and.

• attempts or conspiracies to assault, kill or kidnap the President of

the United States and other designated individuals.

The FBI has investigative jurisdiction of violations of a wide range

of the laws of the United States including primary jurisdiction in this —

• country concerning sabotage and subversion against the United

States.

III.

Exchange of Information and Coordination of Responsibilities

The USSS undertakes to identify individuals or groups who,

because of their propensities or characteristics, may be dangerous

by its nature reveals a danger or possible danger to the President

and certain other persons, or which can be construed as falling

within the categories of information desired by the USSS as set

forth in Section IV of this agreement.

The FBI will inform the USSS of the identity of individuals or

organizations who come to the attention of the FBI as knowingly

and willingly advocating, abetting," advising, of teaching the duty,

necessity, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government

of the United States, or the government of any state, territory, or

, possession, or political subdivision therein, by force or violence,

or by the assassination of any officer of any such government. The

FBl will furnish the USSS with reports on such individuals or organi-

zations as requested. During investigation by the FBI of such

individuals or organizations, the FBI will be alert and promptly

other statute over which the FBI has jurisdiction.

It will be the responsibility of the FBI to advise the USSS when

investigation is being initiated under Section 1751 and thereafter to

(A) SPEECH MATTERS -- I was pleased to note that a new high of

14, 430 public appearance commitments (including speeches, radio and

television appearances, and career day functions) were handled in the

field during the 1969 calendar year. Additionally encouraging was the

continued strong leadership afforded this vital public relations program.

by Special Agents in Charge. The increased utilization of television and

radio facilities was likewise gratifying, and further intensification in these

areas is strongly encouraged. The availability of filmed featurettes on

the FBI Laboratory should be borne in mind, as they are particularly

effective for television use. By enthusiastically reaching key segments

of the population throughout the country the Bureau's responsibilities

and accomplishments can be kept before the public and the cooperation

of responsible citizens encouraged. Continued caution must be exercised

to avoid involvement in local controversies or situations capable of

generating unwarranted criticism of the Bureau. Suggestions for im-

proved achievements in the field of public appearances are welcome

(C) BUREAU AUTOMOBILE (BUCAR) - ACCIDENT MATTERS -- SAC

Letter 69-62 of October 21, 1969, informed you that there were 12 more

Bucar accidents during fiscal year 1969 than during iscal year 1968.

During the first six months of liscal year 1970, there were 30 more Bucar

accidents than during the comparable period in fiscal year 1969. Such an

increase represents an alarming trend-even though it is realized that-Bureau -

employees were not responsible for most of them. The fact remains

accidents were wasteful in terms of investigative and administrative time.

You must constantly stress to employees the human and financial

costs resulting from accidents and that safe operation of vehicles should be

foremost in the use of our automotive fleet. In considering the rapidly growing

volume of traffic on our roads, the importance of defensive driving needs

increased emphasis. Effective use of safety posters furnished by the Bureau,

discussions at conferences, continued training of new Agents and use of any

available safe driving films should be included in this regard.

As in the past, the office policy to use snow tires or chains rests

with the SAC because of the variations in prevailing weather conditions. There

has been a rash of accidents during recent months when snow or ice conditions

were a factor. If snow tires or chains are not being utilized under such

circumstances, your analysis of the accident must include your observations

whether their use might have prevented the accident together with any indicated

explanations and recommendations for administrative action.

In forwarding investigative reports, any photographs obtained

should be transmitted to the Bureau in duplicate, and you should insure

that reports and Form SF-91 (Operator's Report of Motor Vehicle Accidents)

contain no administrative information. Specifically, "official business"

should be used in lieu of any data which might identify the employee's

mission. Such administrative data should be set out only in the

cover pages of the report. Moreover, in forwarding Form SF-95 (Claim

for Damage or Injury) and any supporting documents, insure that Form

SF-95 is submitted in quadruplicate and that any supporting documents are

submitted in triplicate.

In this regard, all employees should be reminded that when a

claim is made, employees should make no admissions of responsibility

2/3/70

SAC LETTER 70-6

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 641

---

## Page 642

and should not enter into negotiations or discussions but should merely

furnish the Form SF-95 so the requisite administrative claim may be made.

Claims should definitely not be solicited.

While manual provisions obviate the necessity for investigations

of Bucar accidents involving no personal injury or property damage in excess

of $25, such accidents must nevertheless be promptly reported in accordance

with manual instructions. You will be held personally accountable for

insuring that the accident is promptly investigated in every instance where

circumstances indicate the desirability of such action. Particular care

should be exercised to make certain the extent of property damage has been

accurately estimated.

You should, accordingly, be alert to any information of the

nature requested, particularly with respect to French separatists or

Irish dissidents, and should furnish to the Bureau any such data received

in a form suitable for dissemination by Legat, Ottawa, to RCMP.

Information received during the visit or so soon beforehand as to obviate

the possibility of timely dissemination should be furnished the Bureau by

telephone or teletype and, in the case of Canadian border offices, should

be furnished at the same time to adjoining RCMP detachments.

(E) POSSIBLE VIOLENCE BY BLACK PANTHER PARTY DIRECTED

AGAINST BUREAU PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES - RACIAL MATTERS --

As the Bureau's exhaustive investigations of the violence-prone Black

Panther Party and its personnel continue and its leadership becomes aware

of our continuing efforts in combating their terroristic and illegal activities:

it has become apparent the Black Panther Party has adopted a more

fervently violent attitude with regard to the Bureau as an investigative

agency and, more specifically, with respect to our investigative personnel.

In view of the above and since the Black Panther Party has a

lengthy history of violent activities directed against law enforcement of-

ficers, it is obvious our investigative personnel should constantly be alert

to the possibility of acts of violence being directed against them and/or

our field offices and other operational facilities. It should therefore fol-

low that all investigative personnel be alert to the need for exercising

caution and good judgment, as well as thoroughness, in their day-to-day

investigations of this group and of the need for taking immediate and

aggressive action on development of such information.

(F) CHARACTERIZATIONS OF RACIAL AND MILITANT BLACK

ORGANIZATIONS - NATION OF ISLAM -- Under existing instructions,

auxiliary offices conducting continuing investigation of Nation of Islam

(NOI) affiliate branches are required to submit to the Bureau by June 1

of each year characterizations of the branches. Such action regarding

NOI-branches-is no-longer necessary-

Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, the NOI exercises

complete and continuing control of its affiliate branches which are referred

to as Muhammad's Mosques or Temples. Teachings of branch officials

are consistent with those of NOI leader Elijah Muhammad and his top

echelon; publication and distribution of its official newspaper to the

various branches are handled at the Chicago headquarters and money is

forwarded on a regular basis by the various branches to Chicago. Data

of this nature showing the close affiliation with the parent organization

is consistently set forth in reports and letterhead memoranda prepared

by offices responsible for branches and branch members.

Tha following up-to-date characterization of the national

organization of the NOI should be utilized in future communications

prepared for dissemination and requiring inclusion of the NOl characteri-

zation. The use of a characterization of a NOI affiliate branch in con-

junction with the national organization characterization is no longer -

necessary. Appropriate manual and handbook revisions will be forth-

coming-

NATION OF ISLAM

A source advised on January 12, 1970, the Nation of Islam

(NOI), an organization for members of the black race only, had its

origin in Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1930's. Headquarters is

Muhammad's Temple Number 2, 5335 South Greenwood Avenue, Chicago,

Illinois, which affords direction

to numerous atfiliate branches, commonly

referred to as Muhammad's Temples or Mosques, located throughout the

United States. The leader is Elijah Muhammad, self-styled "Messenger

of Allah" and the only divinely appointed leader of the black race in the

United States, who controls all policies and programs.

Muhammad's teachings stress Allah (God) selected him to

lead the so-called Negro out of slavery in North America through

establishment of an independent black nation in the United States; the

white man is the "devil" and open enemy of the black man; black and

white races must be separated; the white man, his Government and

religion will be destroyed by Allah through the forces of nature in the

"War of Armageddon," a war between Allah and the "devil. " Muhammad's

teachings are spread through weekly radio broadcasts throughout the

United States and through "Muhammad-Speaks; " the official NOI organ.

which is published weekly in Chicago and distributed to affiliate Mosques

for use in weekly sermons and for distribution to the public.

Muhammad and other NOI members have refused to comply

with Selective Service Laws stating that they respect laws of the United

States provided they do not conflict with NOI laws. They do not believe

the Government should force them to participate in wars when they have

nothing to gain.

(B) STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY (WEATHERMAN)

INTERNAL SECURITY - STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY --

Mark Rudd, leader of the violent militant Weatherman faction of the

Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), at a recent closed conterence

of Weatherman members in Cleveland made a statement that the current

plans of the group are to go underground and to direct "strategic

sabotage," not so much at Federal buildings; but at military and police

installations. This sabotage is to be implemented by the use of

bombs, assassinations and direct confrontation with the police. No

specific targets were mentioned by Ruda.

Field offices and their resident agencies can be considered

as police installations and appropriate personnel should be advised of

this threat and that the FBI could also be the target of this group.

Furthermore, appropriate contacts at local police agencies should be

advised of Rudd's statements so that they are aware of possible violence

directed against them.

The fieid has been instructed on a number of occasions to

vigorously investigate the Weatherman group and to develop intormant

coverage in all known Weatherman coliectives. Rudd and other

•Weatherman leaders have previously made similar statements; how~

ever, because of their impending underground status it is imperative -

that penetrative action is taken in these investigations so that the Bureau,

military and police are aware in advance of any violent plans for

terroristic actions directed against them.

March 3, 1970

(A) SATI - SPECIAL ACCIDENT AND TRAVEL INSURANCE -- A supply of

revised brochures and applications for enrollment in SATI are being furnished

under separate cover together with a list of all employees assigned to your

office. Brochure outlines the new Long Term Disability Benefit Plan and our

established Death, Dismemberment and Permanent Total Disability and

Accident Medical Reimbursement plans. The first, which provides total income

protection, is not available elsewhere in the Government. SATI has been

designed to supplement your existing hospital and insurance coverage and

does not duplicate existing programs or benefits.

The enrollment period, commencing immediately, ends on

March 31, 1970. Employees who elect to enroll prior to March 1, 1970, will

be covered effective that date. Employees enrolling after that date will have

coverage effective upon execution of form and submission to Health Benefits

Officer. Thereafter, employees who elected not to enroll in the Long Term

Disability Benefit Plan during this initial enrollment period must provide

medical evidence of insurability prior to a later enrollment. New employees

entering on duty must execute SATI form within 31 days indicating acceptance

or rejection of Long Term Disability Benefit Plan.

Enrollment in our established Death, Dismemberment and

Permanent Total Disability and Accident Medical Reimbursement plans will

continue, as in the past, to be allowed at any time without medical evidence

of insurability.

Accordingly, each Health Benefits Officer should insure that

each employee presently on the rolls executes this form by March 31, 1970,

indicating whether employee elects to enroll or not to enroll in the Long Term

Disability Plan. All forms should then be forwarded to Bureau marked for

attention of Administrative Division. Forms should be returned in alphabetical

order in two groups indicating those employees who elected to enroll in Long

Term Disability Plan and those who declined. The list of employees furnished

your office should also be returned, marked to indicate those employees who

enrolled and those who declined. Thereafter as each new employee enters on

duty, he should execute the form and it should be returned to the Bureau

together with employee's EOD papers.

Each enrollment form, where employee has elected to enroll,

should be accompanied by a deposit premium (check or money order) for one

month's premium. Upon receipt of enrollment form, a SATI Premium Book

containing a coupon for each monthly premium payment will'be forwarded

enrollee by Wright and Company, SATI Administrator. Thereafter on the

-first of each month, monthly coupon-for-coupons if it is desired to pay more

than one month) should be mailed along with premium payment.

Employees presently covered under SATI must file a new

enrollment form to continue their coverage. One may enroll for the same

or additional coverage and the SATI protection will continue without a lapse

in coverage.

Employees should note that this new Long Term Disability

coverage has outstanding features. Plan guarantees total income protection

in the event of disability commencing with the first day of hospitalization;

whether from accident or illness, and continuing through lifetime of employee.

wuhe benefits received are in addition to any annual or sick leave benefits or

other insurance held.

The Civil Service Commission has advised that it is not

possible to deduct premiums for the above plan through payroll deduction

since the plan is unique to the FBI and not a Government-wide program.

1970, and will graduate October 28, 1970. A specitic statement must be

made concerning the review of your field office indices on the applicants

and their law enforcement agencies in the letter listing your candidates.

Alternate candidates who were investigated for the 85th Session

Colby undertook a complete revision of this book last year. The new

version of the "FBI" picture book has just been published by Coward-

McCann, Incorporated, and will soon be available at book stores and

other commercial outlets at a cost of $3.29.

The FBI Recreation Association has arranged to sell the

newly revised book to FBI employées for a special discount price of

$2.60. Orders should be submitted by routing slip and marked:

"Attention, Crime Research Section."

All orders should be accompanied.

by a check payable to the FBI Recreation Association. In order to

facilitate the handling of orders, one employee in each Field Office or

section at the Seat of Government should be designated to coordinate at

least the initial order for these books.

All books mailed will be addressed to the sAC, but should

be distributed in the various offices by the employees designated to

handle the book orders. The Bureau should be notified if books ordered

are not received within a few weeks so they can be traced through the

mails.

(E) NEW LEFT MOVEMENT GROUPS -- By SAC Letter 67-24, dated

May 2, 1967, captioned "Investigation of Student Groups on College

Campuses," you were instructed to submit a quarterly letter listing

identities of such groups under investigation, coverage afforded each

group, and plans and programs of the office to develop necessary

coverage.

The current posture of the New Left movement includes off-

campus, extremely radical communes which advocate terroristic tactics,

including sabotage against police and military' installations and assassi-

nations, to attain political objectives. Informant penetration of such

groups is absolutely essential to develop advance knowledge of such

plans so that appropriate preventative or corrective measures may be

taken and the conspirators prosecuted. Successful prosecution, local

or federal, remains the best deterrent to such illegal activity.

In order to facilitate supervison of these matters at Seat

of Government and streamline paperwork, discuitinue submission-of

quarterly letter and hereafter show in cover pages of New Left

quarterly report, now being submitted, a breakdown of all New Left

groups by chapter, commune, collective, or other such group with

informant coverage afforded each.

(B) BUND DEFAULT MATTERS -- Reference is made to SAC Letter

Number 67-28 dated May 23, 1967, which pointed out the prosecutive

potential inherent in bond default cases. This is illustrated by the

accomplishments of a border office which has been credited with one

third of the convictions in the bond default classification thus far in the

current fiscal year.

Most of the cases handled by this border office involve

persons charged with smuggling narcotics into the United States and

when they failed to appear in the United States District Court for trial,

bond default warrants were obtained by the United States Attorney

and the Bureau's assistance requested to apprehend these individuals.

• Upon apprehension these bond defaulters were prosecuted for violation

of the Bond Default Statute and convictions were obtained with a

minimum of difficulty.

Make certain your office is fully conversant with bond

default matters and has established effective liaison with the United

States Attorney's Office in this regard.

structions which state that correspondence involving technical matters

is to be coordinated on a local basis with technically trained employees.

The sound-trained Agent and, in some instances, the senior Radio

Maintenance Technician (RMT), because of their specialized knowledge

and experience and ready access-to technical reference material, may

be able to supply desired information on the application, availability,

and operation of technical equipment, as well as the utilization of related

investigative techniques. Only through close coordination between

supervisory, investigative, and technical personnel can you obtain the

most efficient use of technical personnel and equipment.

Any technical problems which arise in your office should

be resolved, if possible, by coordination with your sound-trained

Agent or other technical personnel. In addition, you should insure

that all correspondence pertaining to technical matters has been reviewed

by the appropriate sound-trained or technical personnel prior to being

approved by you or other supervisors acting for you.

FBI Laboratory personnel are, of course, available at

• all times for consultation on your technical problems. They are also

available for active, on-site participation where the circumstances

warrant such action.

(D) SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS - POSSIBLE DESTRUCTION OF

SELECTIVE SERVICE RECORDS -- Destructive acts have been committed

at Selective Service boards throughout the country, principally in the

form of breaking and entering during nighttime hours followed by the

mutilation of drait records and damage to property.

The majority of these acts have been the result of anti-

Vietnam and related antidraft activities. Oftentimes, public credit for

the acts is claimed on behalf of individuals or, more frequently, in the

name of a group, such as "Beaver 55" or "Boston 8. "

Statements claiming credit do not, of course, of them-

selves provide proof that such persons or groups were responsible.

Concerted efforts must be made to obtain information from informants

and other sources to identify the persons actually responsible for the

planning and carrying out of such acts.

It is likely that individuals involved have connections.

with groups in other cities; therefore, it is most important that photo-

graphs of suspects and subjects be interchanged between offices.

The fact that individuals who have been identified with

-

such activities often reside out of the state makes it particularly important

that informant coverage is properly coordinated by the offices to assist

in the identification of the subjects in each instance. It is also essential

that thorough investigation be conducted at the scene and that the

physical evidence obtained, including latent fingerprints, be promptly

forwarded to the Bureau for appropriate examination.

(F) UNLAWFUL FLIGHT MATTERS -- The overall field accomplish-

ments in the unlawful flight category for the first eight months of Fiscal

Year 1970 disclosed 1, 788 persons have been apprehended as compared

with 1,875 for a similar period in Fiscal Year 1969. Case receipts by

many offices have shown a decrease.

Thus, the above figures suggest

that the liaison with local authorities needs to be strengthened so that

all meritorious cases are being considered under the Unlawful Flight

Statute. Many offices have advised that local agencies do not request

assistance because of insufficient evidence of interstate flight.

It is recognized that some indication of interstate flight is

necessary to justify authorization, however, you are reminded that

conclusive evidence of interstate flight is unnecessary in these cases

since Federal prosecution is not anticipated. While the Bureau does

not desire to explore the possiblity of unlawful flight process in those

local cases involving minor felonies or civil obligations, it is

mandatory that all offices establish close liaison with local authorities

in connection with rendering assistance under the Unlawful Flight

Statute. This is particularly important because of the notoriety of

many state felons arising from the vicious nature of their crimes.

Such individuals are also logical candidates for the Ten Most Wanted

Fugitives list and serve to sustain public interest in this most important

program. In those instances involving individuals engaged in obvious

crime sprees, each office is expected to promptly explore with local

authorities the possibility of unlawful flight process keeping in mind

that delay in entering such cases because of lack of absolute proof of

interstate flight will obviously affect the progress of the fugitive

investigation. Each office will be followed closely to insure that the

Bureau's obligation is discharged under this statute.

(B) NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS SUBMITTED TO BUREAU BY FIELD

OFFICES -- In a recent survey, it was determined that many offices are

remiss in submitting newspaper clippings to the Bureau pursuant to the

requirements outlined in the Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part 11,

Section 6H. The most common errors are tailure to submit suiticient

numbers of clippings, failure to submit them promptly, improper

-mounting, and the submission of articles bearing the date line of national

wire services.

You should make certain that appropriate personnel of

your office are thoroughly knowledgeable concerning Bureau require-

ments in this regard. The elimination of the Crimdel Program in no

way lessens the field's responsibility to continue to submit news clippings

which were formerly furnished in connection with that program. There

is an especially urgent need at the present time for articles dealing with

juvenile crime, and you should also insure that news items pertaining to

parole and probation abuses, sex offenders, examples of judicial leni-

ency, pornographic literature, and "Top Ten" fugitives are submitted to

the Bureau promptly.

You should follow this matter carefully and afford close

supervision to make certain that maximum effectiveness is being obtained

in your office.

(C) VOUCITER MATTER - MOVING EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS

WITHHOLDING AND DEDUCTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX --

The Tax Reform Act of 1969 (Puilic Law 91-172, approved December 30,

1969) broadened the scope of moving expense reimbursements reportable

as gross income on an employee's Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement;

however, the amount subject to Federal income tax withholdings has

been reduced and corresponding increased deductions are allowed on the

employee's Federal tax return.

The provisions of the Act are applicable

to reimbursements or allowances paid to the employee aiter December 31,

1969, and are not retroactive prior to that date.

Henceforth all amounts paid as reimbursements or allow-

ances for moving expenses must be included as gross income on an

employee's Form W-2. Amounts paid which are subject to tax with-

holdings will be reported on the Form W-2 as 'Wages Paid Subject to

Withholding." On the other hand, amounts paid as reimbursements or

allowances which are not subject to tax withholdings will be reported as

"Other Compensation Paid."

Reimbursements and allowances paid to an employee for

moving expenses are not subject to tax withholdings if, under the new

• regulations, he may deduct them from gross income for income tax

purposes.

Reimbursed moving expenses which are deductible, subject

to the limitations set forth below, are: (1) travel and transportation

expenses of the employee and his immediate family; (2) expenses for

transportation and storage of household goods and personal etfects: (3)

house-hunting trip expenses: (4) temporary quarters allowances; and

(5) real estate transactions and/or lease expenses.

Items (1) and (2) of the above are entirely deductible. The

total amount of deductions allowable for Items (3) and (4), the house-

hunting trip and temporary quarters expenses, is $1, 000. The total

amount allowable as a deduction for Item (5), real estate transactions

or lease expenses, is $2, 500, reduced by the total amount allowable for

• Items (3) and (4), house-hunting trips and/or temporary quarters. For

example if an employee is reimbursed $500 for a house-hunting trip

and/or temporary quarters expenses, he would be able to deduct only up

to $2, 000 for real estate and/or lease expenses. No deduction is

allowed for the miscellancous expense allowance. Reimbursements for

3/31/70

SAC LETTER Y0-M

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525 Page 664

---

## Page 665

moving expenses in excess of the prescribed deduction limitations,

along with reimbursements for the miscellaneous expense allowance,

are subject to tax withholdings at a rate of 20%.

Employees' Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, for

_calendar year 1970 will be prepared in accordance with the new regu-

lations. Therefore, it is incumbent upon each employee to maintain

records of any reimbursed moving expenses incurred so that he will be

able, if necessary, to reconcile for income tax purposes such expenses

with those amounts appearing on his Form W-2.

(D) GHETTO INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- As a result of re-

cent conferences concerning racial informants held at the Seat of Govern-

ment, it has been recommended and approved that ghetto informants be-

approved on the authority of the Special Agent in Charge and that the

probationary status of these informants will no longer be necessary:

Current policy requires that before a ghetto informant can be removed

from a probationary status the Bureau must be advised that certain

specific requirements have been satisfied; thereafter, Bureau authori-

zation is given to remove the probationary status of the informant. You

will no longer be required to advise the Bureau of the identity of the

ghetto irformants and your only requirement will be to give the number

of ghetto informants currently being operated by your office at the time

you submit your monthly racial informant status report.

wer no Current investigation required concerning development

of ghetto informants will remain in effect and it will be the responsi-

bility of each SAC to assure the necessary requirements are fulfilled

before approving these informants.

In addition to the above change it will no longer be necessary

to contact any ghetto informants on a two-week basis as was required in

the handling of probationary ghetto informants. You are now required

to contact ghetto informants on a 30-day basis.

The above changes do not affect your requirements to ob-

tain Bureau authority concerning ghetto informants who will be utilized

in connection with educational institutions.

The above changes should materially ease the administrative

handling of your Ghetto Informant Program and provide you with more

time to develop additional productive ghetto informants throughout your

territory.

Appropriate Manual changes are forthcoming.

(E) RACIAL INFORMANTS - GHETTO INFORMANTS -- As a result of recent

racial informant conferences held at the Seat of Government, a recom-

mendation was made and approved giving the Special Agent in Charge-

(SAC) the option of maintaining subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As you are aware, current policy concerning subfiles relating

to ghetto informants requires that a subfile be maintained on all ghetto

informants regardless of whether or not they are furnishing only "listen-

ing post' type information. Effective immediately, the maintenance of a

subfile for your ghetto informants is being left to the option of the SAC.

There is little reason to maintain a subfile on those ghetto informants

who are used primarily as "listening posts" and furnish information con-

cerning attitudes and tensions within a ghetto area. It will suffice to

place a copy of the report (FD-209) in the racial situation control file,

thereby eliminating its inclusion in a sübfile.

Subfiles may be necessary in those instances when ghetto

informants are reporting valuable substantive information.

Appropriate Manual Change forthcoming.

(F) SABOTAGE -- By SAC Letter 69-31 (C) dated June 3, 1969, you

were alerted to the increase in incidents of Reserve Officers' Training

Corps (ROTC) sabotage cases brought on by New Left antiwar protests.

At that time you were instructed that such matters should be investigated

as sabotage pursuant to Section 86;-Manual-of Instructions, and that these.

cases should be vigorously pursued and promptly reported.

For your information, after a summer without any incidents

of ROTC sabotage, these violent acts began again in September, 1969.

Since that time, there have been 22 separate incidents of ROTC sabotage

on campuses of colleges and universities in all parts of the United States.

The New Left, particularly Students for a Democratic Society,

has increased pressure for greater anti-ROTC action on the campuses.

This has led to violent acts perpetrated on ROTC facilities. From a

review of these incidents, you can fully expect a marked increase in

attacks on ROTC facilities up through the end of the current school year.

You should carefully comply with the provisions of Section 6, Manual of

Instructions, in connection with the investigation and reporting of sabotage

matters.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(A) RETIREMENT - SPECIAL AGENT - TAXABILITY OF ANNUITIES --

The Internal Revenue Service has advised that Special Agents who retire

under the liberalized plan as-distinguished from retiring for disability

are not entitled to the $100 per week exclusion from annuity for Federal

income tax purposes as if they had retired for disability. The Internal

Revenue Service said it has recently noted a number of instances where

the exclusion is being improperly claimed, in violation of Revenue

Ruling 66-182 (1966). Special Agents who retire should be advised

accordingly. The Bureau is making appropriate revision in its Form

3-196, a copy of which is given for information to employees who retire.

United States Attorneys immediately upon their assumption of office.

This instruction is being reemphasized at this time because it appeared._

that many Assistant United States Attorneys attending a recent conference

held at Washington, D. C., lacked a firm understanding of their

responsibilities in office and of their relationships with the FBI.

You should aggressively carry out your liaison responsibilities

by stressing the need for prompt and eifective prosecution of violations

within the Bureau's investigative jurisdiction in line with established

Bureau and Departmental policies.

(C) NEW LEFT AND BLACK EXTREMIST TERRORISM - BOMBING

MATTERS -- In accordance with existing instructions, every bombing

or attempted bombing is to be reported to the Bureau by teletype or

telephone. The Bureau's basic statute in Bombing Matters is Section

837, Title 18, U. S. Code: note that Molotov cocktails, other incendiary

devices and industrial explosions do not come within the purview of

this statute and should not be characterized as bombing matters. The

Department's basic policy with regard to this section is that Congress

clearly intended primary jurisdiction to remain at the state and local

level. Active investigation under this statute is instituted only upon the

specific request of the Department and the Department is highly selective

and restrictive in requesting investigations. While active investigation

should not be instituted under the Bombing Matters character in the

absence of a Departmental request, many bombings may require immediate

investigation under some other criminal statute such as those dealing

with civil rights, destruction of Government property, damaging aircrait

or motor vehicles, train-wrecking: crimes on a Government reservation,

destruction of interstate property, sabotage, and interference with the

Selective Service System. When these or other substantive offenses

within the Bureau's primary jurisdiction are involved, action should be

taken as required by instructions relating to the particular classification.

and the violation involved should be carried as the principal character

on all communications. If there is any question as to whether the facts

constitute a violation, the initial communication should set forth the

opinion of the U. S. Attorney or show that his opinion will be immediately

obtained, except that the opinion of the U. S. Attorney should not be

sought with regard to Section 837, Title 18, U. S. Code, civil rights

statutes or matters involving labor disputes.

Whether or not active investigation is to be instituted, local

authorities are to immediately be offered our cooperation consisting of

the facilities of the Identification Division and FBI Laboratory and the

coverage of out-of-state leads. The initial communication to the Bureau

should show this has been done or is being done. If there is some over-

riding reason why such cooperation should not be offered this is to be

set forth with full justification in the initial communication.

When substantive investigation is being undertaken by the FBI.

every effort should be made to obtain custody of all physical evidence

for appropriate laboratory examination for tracing to its source. If

substantive investigation is not being instituted, local authorities should

be encouraged to preserve all physical evidence.

Concerning instances of bombing or arson which appear to have

New Left or black extremist connotations or motivation, where-no-Bureau

substantive jurisdiction exists or the Department has advised no investi-

gation is warranted, you are immediately to advise the Bureau,

utilizing a dual caption which first sets forth a description of the bombing

or arson incident and is following by "New Left Movement - Violence;

IS - Miscellaneous," or "Black Nationalist Movement; RM." Do not use

a "Bombing Matter" character. A copy should be designated for Bureau

file 100-446997-73 or 157-8415, whichever is appropriate. Information

is to be set .out as to the specific informants contacted and police liaison

set up in conformance with instructions detailed in letter to all Special

Agents in Charge Number 68-41 (H) dated July 23, 1968. Information

should also be included concerning local conditions which would make

involvement of subversive groups or individuals suspect in the incident,

such as recent campus disorders or statements by local extremists.

You should also submit your recommendations as to any additional

investigation which is warranted to resolve whether subversive groups or

individuals were involved. Care and good judgment should be exercised -

to avoid the impression being made on local authorities that the Bureau

is indiscriminately investigating local violations.

You are expected to take an aggressive attitude toward these

matters, bearing in mind the Bureau's responsibility to determine the

full extent of subversive activities affecting the internal security of the

Nation and the expressed concern of the President, Attorney General

and other high officials that subversive groups are engaging in these

terroristic acts.

(B) YOUNG WORKERS LIBERATION LEAGUE (YWLL): ALSO KNOWN

AS YOUNG COMMUNIST WORKERS LIBERATION LEAGUE - INTERNAL

SECURITY - COMMUNIST -- On February 7-9, 1970, the Communist

Party, USA, (CPUSA) sponsored a convention in Chicago, Illinois, to

replace the W. E.B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) with a new com-

munist youth organization. This new organization was formed ostensibly

to attract working class youth, militant black nationalists and members

of the New Left into a communist-controlled "revolutionary organization"*

to aid in "liberation struggles."

This convention founded the Young Workers Liberation

League (YWLL) which at the discretion of each chapter's leadership

can be calied the Young Communist Workers Liberation League. A

thirty-live member central committec was elected which was made up

almost exclusively of the CP members who had controlled the convention

since its inception. Among the resolutions adopted were the uniting of

all youth and adults against war, instructing young people, especially

GI's, on the nature of imperialism and on the "socialist alternative,"

and fighting to end militarization on the campuses.

Mike Zagarell, National Youth Director, CPUSA, was elected

Education Secretary of the WLL and called for the recruitment of 1, 100

new members the first year, thereby making it the largest socialist

youth organization in the country.

All offices should institute necessary investigation and alert

informants and established sources in a position to obtain information •

relative to youth activities to the existence and aims of the YWLL.

Report the formation of any chapters within your respective divisions

to the Bureau and to the New York Office which is designated as the

office of origin in this case. In the event local chapters utilize a local

name for their organization, which is different from that set forth above,

this should be included in the title of any correspondence parenthetically

under the above title.

Defunct thumbnail characterizations and unreported activities

of DCA chapters should be submitted to the Bureau by those offices

where DCA chapters were previously located prior to closing these cases.

CONTACTS WITH COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES -- The Bureau has

been informed by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) that a few colleges

requirement that organizations defend corporate or agency policies to

student groups as a condition for recruitment on campus. CSC advises

that the College Placement Council, representing college placement

associations throughout the country, has transmitted a policy statement

to the president of colleges and universities pointing out its opposition.

The Council, while recognizing the desirability and necessity of effective

communication and exchange of information with students, faculty

members and college administrators, is opposed to an employer being

forced to meet with or to state its position to student groups as a condi-

tion of recruitment on campus.

Any interference with your recruitment effort, such as

outlined above, must be immediately brought to the attention of the

activities at colleges or universities where they or any associated student

groups interfere with or impose such conditions an campus recruitment.

(F) BUREAU APPLICANTS - DRAFT DEFERMENT CHANGES --

President Nixon, April 23, 1970, issued orders which bar occupational

is already occupationally deferred, Bureau will request extension of

deferment when it expires provided his services satistactory. In any

pending Special Agent applicant case where (1) applicant has unfulfilled

Selective Service obligation, (2) is under 26 and has no current occupa-

tional deferment based on employment in law enforcement, discontinue

investigation, advising applicant he can resubmit application when he has

fulfilled military obligation or is otherwise not subject to induction.

Only exception to above is where applicant's draft board states chances

of his induction extremely remote. If Special Agent applicant already has

occupational deferment on basis of existing law enforcement employment,

his case can be processed in usual way because Bureau if it desires to

appoint him is able to request continuation of deferment on basis Special

Agent status. No new Special Agent applicant cases should be opened

where applicant is under 26, has unfulfilled Selective Service obligation

and is potential draftee, unless local board advises chances of induction

extremely remote.

Information available to the Bureau since the issuance of

the above guidelines indicates United States Attorneys (USAs) are fol-

lowing these guidelines and declinations of Federal prosecution are

increasing. At the same time, information furnished by field offices

also indicates local authorities, for various reasons, are not willing to

prosecute in many instances. In order for the Bureau to fully assess

this situation, it is desired all offices maintain figures as to (a) total

number of ITSMV cases deferred by USAs to local or state authorities

and (b) figures showing the total number of these cases in which local

or state authorities will not entertain prosecutive action.

All field offices will begin the maintenance of these records

effective June 1, 1970. The totals will be submitted monthly to reach the

Bureau no later than the third working day of the succeeding month.

Furnish figures by letter, captioned as above, attention Voucher-

report or form FD-411 submitted in lieu thereof to Selective Service

Headquarters. Existing procedures should continue to be utilized in the

submission of a closing report or form FD-411; however, effective

immediately, only one copy of a closing report or form FD-411 submitted

in lieu thereof, should be furnished to the Bureau in Selective Service cases.

Of course, extra copies of reports would continue to be required in in-

stances when the Department has requested the investigation, when a clear

indication exists that the Department or some other Government agency

would require a copy and when Public Law 414, 82nd Congress, involving

exclusion of aliens from this country is applied.

In addition, it will no longer be necessary to furnish the

Bureau with a copy o1 a report or form FD-411 in routine-type cases that

have been resolved win 90 days of receipt of the case by the field, that is,

where the delinquency has been resolved and the U. S. Attorney has declined

prosecution. For uniformity, these cases should be closed by use of form

FD-411 being placed in the field oifice file and designating a copy to the

appropriate U. S. Attorney to serve as a confirmation of his prosecutive

(C) BUREAU AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS -- Since issuance of SAC

Letter 70-6 of February 3, 1970, the increase in the number of accidents

involving Bucars has continued. As of the end of April, 1970, 395

Bucar accidents were reported compared with 301 for the same period

during the previous fiscal year. This figure also is substantially higher

than the total of 363 for fiscal year 1969.

Causes of accidents include failure to adhere to such basic

safe-driving steps as use of the parking brake after bringing the vehicle

to a stop. It should be evident to all operators that use of the parking

lever alone is not adequate. When one considers the possible damage

to the Bucar, other property, and possible injury to persons, the

automatic use of both the parking lever and the parking brake is ele-

mentary and should be considered mandatory.

The attention of all employees who operate motor vehicles

should be brought to this frequent cause of accidents. When failure to

apply both the parking brake and parking lever contributes to the cause

of an accident involving a Bucar, employees will be held responsible

without fail and administrative action will be taken.

(D) - SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS - MORATORIUM ON

SECURITY MATTER - COMMUNIST (SM - C) INVESTIGATIONS --

Recent field inspection shows need to reiterate prior insiructions re-

garding current moratorium on SM - C investigations. Moratorium

was initiated by Bureau letter to all offices dated February 27, 1969,

and extended by letters dated September 17, 1969, and May 4, 1970,-

captioned "Security Investigations of Individuals." Moratorium will

be reevaluated January 1, 1971.

Routine SM - C investigations are not to be conducted during

moratorium. Do not open cases for verification of residence and employ-

ment of subjects in SM - C cases which have been placed in Priority II

or Ill of Security Index where cases were closed in line with existing

instructions. Note these instructions apply only to routine communist

investigations. Due to extreme radical, anti-United States and violent

nature of Marxists, anarchists and pro-Chinese revolutionaries who

largely make up such organizations as Progressive Labor Party,

Weatherman faction of Students for a Democratic Society, and Socialist

Workers Party and its extremist youth group, Young Socialist Alliance,

moratorium does not apply to investigations of these individuals.

Further, you must remain aware of whereabouts of those extremists

under Emergency Detention Program.

Discuss above with appropriate personnel to be certain

routine SM - C cases are not investigated during moratorium. Equally

insure your responsibilities are met in the more violent and revolution-

ary cases in security investigations of individuals.

Abbott H. Hoffman, members of the Black Panther Party and the

Weathermen (a faction oi Students for a Democratic Society) who are

admittedly dedicated to violence and who have in the past been known

to be in possession of explosives or weapons, have engaged in wide -

spread air travel recently in connection with their activities.. In view

of this increased air travel by members of extremist, militant and

possibly organized crime groups, you should be alert to violations of

the Crime Aboard Aircraft (CAA) Statute. In those instances where

your office learns in advance of travel plans of individuals associated

with these groups, you should promptly alert the Federal Aviation

Administration (FAA). Electronic metal detection equipment is

currently being utilized by FAA to identify individuals with concealed

weapons prior to their boarding an aircraft.

Violations of the CAA Statute coming to your attention

involving the above-mentioned groups should immodiately be presented

to appropriate U. S. Attorney for a prosecutive opinion. Under the

CAA Statute there is no necessity, nor is it desirable from the Bureau's

standpoint, that subjects considered for prosecution actually board.

(C) DESERTER MATTERS - MILITARY SERVICES ENTERING

*DESERTERS INTO NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) --

The Departments of the Navy and Air Force are currently entering

deserters into NCIC under their NCIC agency identifiers. On July 1,

1970, the Department of the Army began entering deserters through

Army field NCIC terminals located at the headquarters of each military

district headquarters (Fort George G. Meade, Maryland; Fort

McPherson, Georgia: Fort Sheridan, Illinois; Fort Sam Houston,

Texas; The Presidio of San Francisco, California; and the Military

District of Washington, Fort Myer, Virginia). It is expected the military

entries will be made prior to the referral of these cases to the Bureau

for investigation. The Marine Corps contemplates entering its

deserters into NCIC in the near future.

In order that there will be no misunderstanding, this will

in no way change existing procedures for accepting cases for active

deserter investigations. As in the past, we will initiate such investi-

gations only upon receipt at the Seat of Government of a properly executed

Department of Defense form 553 (DD-553) or Department of the Army

form 3545 (DA-3545) which has been processed by the interested branch

of the military and forwarded to the Bureau. Upon receipt of the proper

form from the Bureau initiating a FUDE investigation, the office of

origin will enter the fugitive deserter into NCIC under the Field Office

agency identifier.

In those instances where inquiry of NCIC resülts in a response

showing only a military record on file, the deserter is not considered a

Bureau fugitive. You will take no investigative action, but any information

concerning the deserter should be disseminated to proper military

authorities.

Where the response shows an FBI record and a military

record in NCIC, you will know the deserter is considered a Bureau

fugitive deserter and you will take all necessary action to protect the

Bureau's interests.

(D) HANDLING OF INQUIRIES REGARDING CORRESPONDENCE

MATTERS -- On occasion it is necessary to have discreet inquiries con-

ducted regarding communications received at the Seat of Government.

This is done in those instances where insufficient information is avail-

able in Bureau files to evaluate and handle the incoming communication.

Requests to receive the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, restricted

material, reprints in large volume, statements for special occasions;-

or autographed material of various types are frequently received. Recently,

a person representing himself to be a doctor telephonically requested an

autographed photograph for an individual described as a 16-year-old boy

dying of leukemia. Information developed by the field determined this

request to be a hoax.

In order to insure that future communications of a similar

nature may be appropriately evaluated and handled, general guidelines re-

garding the extent of inquiries to be conducted by the field are being set

forth.

While situations will vary, requests for the FBI Law Enforce-

ment Bulletin and for material which is restricted in distribution to law

enforcement personnel only require verification of status in law enforce-

ment and a check oi office indices to insure your files contain no infor-

mation which would make it inadvisable to honor the request.: Should the

request involve receiving reprint material in large volume or a statement

for a special occasion, your inquiries should be expanded to include a

check of appropriate credit and police agency records. If these records

do not indicate the general reputation of the person or group making the

request, limited, discreet inquiries of trusted contacts should be made.

In the event the matter requiring field attention involves a request of a

personal nature, such as a request for an autographed photograph, books

or other material, office indices, credit and police agency records are

to be checked to verify the individuals involved are who they are purported

to be and to determine if any derogatory information is known regarding

them.

If your indices, credit and police agency checks are all negative,

you see regret at co out person, involvet and ries to estab reques

is not a hoax or designed to embarrass the FBI. Of course, all inquiries

conducted must be handled in such a manner that the persons involved

will not become aware of our interest. These guidelines must be observed.

we cannot jeopardize our position by utilizing individuals who may

(A) "THE INVESTIGATOR" - In order to insure that each office re-

ceives the coverage available to it in "The Investigator, " all divisions

are urged to submit adequate material for inclusion. Some offices

-have a good record year after year. Others with a bit more effort

could increase their contributions and, by doing so, receive much

better representation in the magazine.

I want each SAC to encourage all employees of his

Division to fully cooperate with their Associate Editor so that

"The Investigator" may reflect the activities and interests of as many

employees as possible.

(B) RACIAL AND SECURITY INFORMANTS -- I am again calling to

your attention instructions previously issued concerning the need for

strict control of racial and security informants as well as the contin-

ving need for quality informants.

The necessity for in-depth quality informants in the

racial and security field is more imperative than ever under present

conditions in view of the upsurge in violence. I will not tolerate com-

placency or backsliding in informant coverage.

There must be close control and supervision of inform-

ants as well as the Special Agents handling these informants in this

extremely sensitive fieid. As you are well aware, embarrassment

brought about by the activities of an informant in the racial or secu-

rity field could endanger our entire intelligence gathering operation.

Accordingly, you must insure that these matters are given the super-.

vision that is required and you must also insure that all payments to

informants are made on a C.O.D. basis and fuil value is received for

each payment made.

I expect quality informants to be developed in these

extremist groups at a regular rate and that these informants furnish

the necessary intelligence information in order that we can fulfill our

obligations.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

(A) INVESTIGATION OF EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS -/ Recent

activities in Latin America as well as in California on the part of

revolutionary extremists in the kidnaping of public officials and

diplomats for hostage purposes dictate the need for intensification

of investigation of such extremist organizations as the Black

Panther Party, the Students for a Democratic Society including

the Weatherman faction, and similar violence-prone organizations

both national and local in scope.

I consider this to be a matter of greatest importance

and am holding you personally responsible for the development•

of informant coverage in these organizations whereby the Bureau

is in a position to ascertain the plans of such extremist elements

which might call for the abduction or kidnaping of high-ranking

Government officials (local and Federal), members of the diplomatic

corps, and United Nations officials as well as members of any

of their families for hostage purposes. ..

Your efforts in this regard will be the subject of close

scrutiny during future inspections.

(B) ELECTRONIC INTERCEPTION -- Attempts to install electronic

interception devices have sometimes been handicapped by refusal of the

communications carrier or other organization or person to cooperate

with law enforcement.

Refusal to cooperate was based on a fear of

violating the law and of being held either criminally or civilly responsible

-for the violation.

The problem appears to be resolved by amendments to the

pertinent statutes, enacted as a part of Public Law 91-358, effective

July 29, 1970. Briefly, the amendments provide that (1) it shall not be

unlawful for the communications carrier or its officer, employee, or

agent to cooperate with a law enforcement oificer authorized to intercept

a wire or oral communication; (2) the court authorizing the interception

may direct the carrier or person to cooperate; and (3) it the carrier or

person does so cooperate in good faith reliance on legal authorization of

the interception he shall have a complete defense to the criminal or civil

action which might be brought against him.

The full text of the pertinent amendments reads as follows:

Sec. 211. (a) Section 2511 (3) (a) of title 18, United

States Code, is amended (1) by inserting "(i)" immediately after _

'"(2) (a)"; and (2) by adding at the end thereof the following:

"(ii) It shall not be unlawful under this chanter for an

officer, employee, or agent of any communication common carrier

to provide information, facilities, or technical assistance to an

investigative or law enforcement aificer who, pursuant to this

chapter, is authorized to intercept a wire or oral communication."

(b) Section 2518 (4) of title 18, United States Code,

is amended by adding after and below paragraph (e) the

following:

"An order authorizing the interception of a wire or

oral communication shall, upon request of the applicant,

direct that a communication common carrier, landlord, cus-

todian or other person shall furnish the applicant forthwith

all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary

to accomplish the interception unobtrusively and with a minimum

of interference with the services that such carrier, landlord,

custodian, or person is according the person whose communi-

cations are to be intercepted. Any communication common

carrier, landlord, custodian or other person furnishing such

facilities or technical assistance-shall-be-compensated therefor -

by the applicant at the prevailing rates."

• (c) The last sentence of section 2520 of title 18, United

States Code, is amended to read as follows: "A good faith

reliance on a court order or legislative authorization shall con-

stitute a complete defense to any civil or criminal action brought

under this chapter or under any other law."

The quoted provisions take effect February 1, 1971.

Advise all investigative personnel.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGION, D.C. 20535

September 1, 1970

(A) "ATTACK ON TERROR: THE FBI AGAINST THE KU KLUX KLAN

IN MISSISSIPPI"' -- The Bureau has cooperated with Don Whitehead,

author of "The FBI Story," in a new book entitled "Attack on Terror:

The FBI Against the Ku Klux Klan in Mississiopi." This new book

is written in the same interesting, detailed and authentic manner as

"The FBI Story." It deals primarily with our investigation of the

murder of the three civil rights workers--James Chaney, Andrew

Goodman, and Michael Schwerner--near Philadelphia, Mississippi,

in June, 1964. Several other civil rights cases soived by the FBI in

the 1960's are explained in less detail in the book; and Don Whitehead

also cites specific examples of our success at penetrating Klan groups

with informants who helped to prevent other acts of violence.

"Attack on Terror: The FBI Against the Ku Klux Klan in

"Mississippi" has been selected by the publisher, Junk & Wagnalls, as

the top book on its fall, 1970, publication list. Its official publication

date is September 15th, and a condensation of it appears in the

September, 1970, issue of "The Reader's Digest."

Retail price of the book will be $6.95. However, through

special arrangements with the publisher, the FBIRA will be able to

sell the book to FBI employees ior $4.00. Fach Offce shouid advise

its personnel of the availability of this new book at the discount price

of $4.00. Orders for the book should be submitted to the Bureau by

routing slip (Attention: Crime Research Section) accompanied by a

check covering the full amount of the order made payable to the FBIRA.

(B) FLU INOC LATION PROGRAM - 1970-71 -- Flu shots are again

being offered te Bureau employees on a voluntary basis at Bureau expense.

Although no epidemic is forecast, past experience has demonstrated

that such forecasts have not been very accurate. For precautionary

health reasons it is desirable to encourage employees to barticipate

in this worthwhile program.

Make arrangements for the initial shot to be given in

September, 1970. The boöster shot should be administered no later than

the middle of November, 1970. Employees who did not receive a flu.

shot during the last flu season will require the initial and booster shots.

Employees who received a flu shot during the last season will require

only a single booster shot this coming flu season. If there is any question

as to the number of shots necessary, the physicians who will administer

your program this year should be consulted.. The formula for the Bivalent

flu vaccine remains the same as last year. It contains A-≥ (Hong Kong

Variant) and B strains (Massachusetts Variant). Vaccine should be

ordered by routing slip directed to. Property Management Unit; Room

5262. Adult and Minor Waiver forms (3-343 and 3-343a, respectively,)

should be ordered well in advance of inoculation dates by routing slip

to the Supply Unit, Room B-216. When the prugram is completed and

no later than December 31, 1970, advise the Personnel Section by routing

slip of the (a) total personnel; (b) number of employees inoculated; and

(c) doctor's fee. Waiver forms should be destroyed six months after

the current program ends. Secure a commitment now irom your super-

vising physician in order to insure your program will commence in

September, 1970.

Before ordering vaccine from the Bureau, canvass your

employees to secure the number who are interested in participating so

that your order will be accurate. When the vaccine is received it must

be kept under refrigeration and you should note freezing destroys its

potency. Do not order the vaccine from any source other than the Bureau.

Surplus vaccine should be returned Air Mail Special Delivery to the

Health Service, Room 4545, Seat of Government, promptly upon completion

of the program. You may again pay the supervising physician up to

$100 per day. Give this program your personal attention because greater

participation will help to minimize the effects of flu and reduce

absenteeism.

(F) NEW LEFT MOVEMENT - VIOLENCE - INTERNAL SECURITY -

MISCELLANEOUS (WEATHERMAN) -- The 'Declaration of War"

reportedly delivered by current Bureau fugitive Bernaräine Dohrn in

behalf of the Weatherman and the recent violent terromstic acts which

have taken lives oi Americans and caused serious consequences to the

public safety strongly indicate a positive need for aggressive action in

the development oi informants and sources who can furnish advance

information regaraing the activities of such organizations.

The terrorist philosophy of the Weatherman, called

"Strategic Sabotage," against military and police installations and

recently developed intelligence information unquestionably indicate that

the FBI, its field offices, and Resident Agencies throughout the country

are vulnerable to the terroristic tactics of these madmen. No office

can consider itself immune to such action.

:a.f..

The start of school this year will be a springboard for re-

cruiting young people into the various militant youth organizations and

the formation of their revolutionary pians.

To alert appropriate military and police officials to the

activities of these organizations to enable them to take appropriate action

to protect life and property, each Agent should be personally informed

of this threat and all security personnel charged with responsibility of

developing better intormant coverage. . Each Scecial Agent in Charge

is personally responsible to insure adequate precautions and plans are

taken to protect Bureau personnel and secure Bureau space.

(B) NEW LEFT AND BLACK EXTREMIST TERRORISM - INFORMANT

COVERAGE -- You have been advised in the past of the growing incidents

of terroristic acts by the New Left and black extremists and the need

for intensification of our investigations and development of new sources

to combat these escalating problems.

However, a review of the New Left Movement - Violence

airtels submitted monthly by each field office indicates generally that

• your informant coverage of terrorist organizations and individuals is

grossly inadequate.

You are, therefore, instructed to immediately institute

an aggressive policy of developing new productive informants who can

infiltrate the ranks of terrorist organizations, their collectives,

communes and staffs of their underground newspapers. The Bureau

fully recognizes that the development of sources to penetrate these

groups is made extremely difficult because oi their immoral conduct

and use of drugs. It calls for initiative and new approaches to develon

the needed intelligence information.

Concerning black extremists, it is essential that quality

informants are developed at a regular rate. These informants shouid -

be the type who can obtain advance information concerning planned

acts of violence or who are in a position to furnish information concern-

ing contemplated acts of violence.

You should include in Item 4 of your monthly airtel on

"New Left - Violence; Internal Security - Miscellaneous (Weatherman),"

as outlined in Bureau airtel to all offices May 13, 1970, constructive

plans to implement the program outlined above concerning New Leit

terrorist organizations through informant development. Recommendations

relating to the development of a specific source or plan of action should

be submitted to the Bureau by separate communication.

(C) SECURITY AND RACIAL INFORMANTS -- Never in our history have

we been confronted with as critical a need for informant coverage. Ter-

roristic violence surrounds us and more has been threaiened. Bombings,

assassination of police officers, kidnapping and murder are all part of

the picture. Fanatics are at large who are at war with the Government

and the American people. Particularly critical is the need for reliable™

information about the activities of violence-oriented youthful groups on

campus.

As you are aware, you have been previously instructed not

to use campus student informants under the age of 21. In view of cur-

rent circumstances, you are authorized to develop student security and

racial informants who are 18 years of age or older. This presents you

with a tremendous opportunity to expand your coverage, which is

expected. However, in no way are your obligations to exercise

selectivity and tight control lessened in this most sensitive area.

Appropriate manual and handbook changes are-fortheoming.

(A) HOLIDAY LEAVE POLICY -- Requests for annual leave during the

Christmas-New Year's holidays may be granted to the extent the

employees' services can be spared, with preference given thöse whö

have not had a vacation during the year for leave over one holiday or

both.

No leave without pay for absence during the holiday period

will be approved. All employees, particularly those who plan long

distance holiday travel, must bear this in mind.

The 1970 leave year does not end until January 9, 1971.

Employees having a maximum accumulation of thirty or more days

should understand that leave earned in the current leave year but

mused at the close of the leave year is forfeited. Likewise, an

employee with a maximum accumulation exceeaing thirty days will

lower it if he uses more leave during the year than he earns. Your

leave schedule must if possible be so arranged as to permit employees

to take annual leave they request and which they would otherwise lose.

The Bureau's concurrence must be secured when it is proposed to

deny an employee's request with the result he will forfeit leave.

(C) FILM ENTITLED "BANK ROBBERIES" -- The Bureau has prepared

a new film entitled "Bank Robberies." This is a 16-millimeter, black

and white sound film which has a running time of approximately eight

minutes.

It highlights the confusion caused by conversation between

witnesses and the contamination of the crime scene which often occurs

following bank robberies. The film stresses that bank employees should

strive to observe the bank robber closely during the robbery, be pre---

pared to provide law enforcement officers with details of the bank

robbery accurately, and endeavor to carefully preserve the crime scene

in order that it may be properly processed for evidence following the

crime. Film footage from actual bank robberies is used to illustrate

the points we wish to make.

This film is intended for your use in connection with lectures

on bank robbery before banking personnel and may also be utilized in

training programs dealing with this subject. It is felt that as a visual

aid it will have a stronger impact on the viewer if it is presented in

connection with an appropriate lecture by the Bureau representative

showing it.

(D) EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION -- The United States Court of Appeals

for the Third Circuit recently held that once an accused has been arrested

he has a constitutional right to the presence of counsel at any post-arrest

exhibition of identification photographs to witnesses who later testify at

trial to that identification. U. S. v. Zeiler, 427 F2d 1305 (1970).

The Zeiler decision is contrary to an earlier decision in

the same circuit, U. S. v. Conway, 415 F2d 158 (1969); reh. den. 422

F2d 388. Moreover, both the Second Circuit in U. S. V. Bennett, 409

F2d 888, cert. den. sub nom. Haywood v. U.S., 396 U.S. 852, reh.

den. 396 U.S. 949 (1970), and the Fifth Circuit in U. S. v. Ballard,

423 F2d 127 (1970), held that the accused under arrest is not entitled

to have counsel present at a post-arrest photographic identification. In

Ballard the Fifth Circuit cited Rech v. U. S.; 410 F2d 1131 (1969) (10th

Cir.), cert. den. 396 U.S. 970, and U. S. v. Robinson 406 F2d 64 (1969)

(7th Cir.), cert. den. 395 U.S. 926, as well as Bennett, supra, in support

of its position. Tafoya v. Eyman, 315 F. supp. 204 (1970) (D.C., Ariz.),

agrees with Bennett and Ballard.

This split among the circuits leaves some uncertainty.

For your guidance it can be said that the preferred method of eyewitness

identification in any post-arrest situation is in using the lineup only.

This procedure avoids raising the referenced question on which the circuits

are in disagreement. It also avoids that due process question which is

raised when the accused on trial contends that because of the characteris-

tics of the photographs shown, or the manner in which they were exhibited,

the investigating officers were in effect "suggesting" to the witness that

photograph which was the correct one to choose.

The rule stated immediately above is inadequate, however,

for three reasons. First, it fails te recognize the fart that in Bennett and

other cases the sometimes valuable technique of post-arrest identification

by photograph has been permitted. Second, it fails to recognize an appar-

ent conflict between Zeiler and Conway in the Third Circuit. Third, it

fails to recognize any one of the many special circumstances which might-

modify the position taken in Zeiler.

The technique of post-arrest identification by photograph

may be used, when believed necessary, in cases to be tried in those

circuits and districts in which it has been approved. If in doubt on the

rule in your circuit or district, consult the U. S. Attorney. In cases to

be tried in the Third Circuit, and in circuits and districts which have

taken no position on this question, the technique may be used, when

believed necessary, on the approval of the U. S. Attorney.

These instructions assume that in all photographic identifica-

tions the characteristics and the numbers of the photographs used, and the

manner in which they are displayed, will be such that there is nothing to

suggest to the witness which photograph he should select.

Advise all investigative personnel.

(F) EVALUATING INFORMANTS -- Bureau has noted recent tendency

of field to evaluate informants who have furnished reliable information

in the past as being "of known reliability."

SAC Letter 55-26 dated March 29, 1955, Paragraph E,

specitically instructed that an informant was not to be classified as

being "of known reliability" but rather when pertinent as one "who has.

furnished reliable information in the past." Manual of Rules and

Regulations, Part II, Section 4, Page 20, sets forth guidelines and

terminoiogy to be used in describing reliability of informants. No

provisions are made therein for use of phrase "of known reliability,"

and it should not be used.

(A) IDENTIFICATION MATTERS - REQUEST FOR CHECK OF IDENTI-

FICATION DIVISION RECORDS - SUBMISSION OF LATENT FINGER-

PRINT EVIDENCE AND REQUEST FOR TESTIMONY OF LATENT

FINGERPRINT EXAMINERS - In the past year the Identification Division

name files grew to a record 168 million index cards representing ap-

proximately 82 million persons. Also, requests of the Latent Finger-

print Section for latent print examinations, testimony and training

continued to increase at an unprecedented rate. The great demands

being made on these facets of the Bureau's operation necessitate that

current procedures be reviewed at this time and that all investigative

personnel be reminded to follow these procedures in order to be assured

of continued, prompt and positive handling of their requests.

When requesting a name search it should be borne in mind that

the Identification Division's name indices and fingerprint records are keyed

to FBI, local arrest, and military service numbers: therefore, this infor-

mation

should be furnished at all times, where possible, to assist in the

search and further for the purpose of providing a positive reply. Also, in

view of the present size of the name files, requests for searches of common

names should be avoided until sufficient identifying data is obtained and

submitted to aid in the search.

In making requests for the services of the Latent Fingerprint

Section the following procedures should be borne in mind: (1) When sub-

mitting evidence for examination the original items should be submitted

wherever possible instead of photographs of the latent lifts. If the original

items cannot be submitted, of course, photographs will suffice. (2) Re-

quests for the appearances of Fingerprint Examiners at preliminary and

grand jury hearings should be discouraged and in lieu of such appearances

the appropriate Latent Fingerprint Section reports should be used if at all

possible. (3) The Bureau should be given as much advance notice as

possible when requesting testimony of Fingerprint Examiners so as to

avoid any contlicts in court commitments. (4) All cancellations of testi-

mony should be furnished to the Bureau by the most expeditious means to

preclude possible unnecessary travel. (5) Prosecuting attorneys should

be encouraged to release Fingerprint Examiner personnel as soon as

possible after testimony.

available for noncombatant military service only), I-Y (registrant

qualified for military service only in time of war or national emergency),

IV-F (registrant not qualified for any military service), etc. Results

of inquiry should be set forth under general comments, item 35, of the

few months there will be several changes in United States Attorneys'

offices throughout the country. It is your responsibility to thoroughly

indoctrinate new United States Attorneys and new Assistant United States

Attorneys immediately upon their assumption of office. It is incumbent

on you to stress the necessity of prosecuting all violations within the

Bureau's investigative jurisdiction and the need for all United States

Attorneys to adopt a prompt and aggressive prosecutive policy..

You are again reminded that you must closely follow the

personnel situation as regards Federal Judges and in the United States

Attorneys' offices. It any shortage exists which has an effect on the

handling of our cases such shortage must immediately be brought to

the attention of the Bureau.

(D) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY ASSOCIATES RETRAINING SESSIONS

FOR 1969 -- Advise the Bureau, Attention: Training Division, by

June 1, 1969, the dates and places of your 1969 retraining sessions for

graduates of the FBI National Academy. If your retraining session

will be held in advance of that date, Bureau should be given at least

30 days' notice. The Bureau-should be furnished with the detailed -

program to be followed, and your personal attention should be given

to the planning of these

sessions to make certain that the emphasis is

on subject matter of value and interest to the graduates who will attend.

All correspondence should be directed to the Bureau,

Attention: Training Division, and should be submitted on an unless-

advised-to-the-contrary-by-Bureau (UACB) basis.

You are reminded that there will be a Sectional Retraining

Session in Section III (Southeastern States) from July 13-16, 1969, at

the Americana Hotel, Bal Harbour, Florida. No regularly scheduled

chapter. retraining gessions should be held in Section Il during 1969.

Graduates from the Southeastern States as well as from the rest of the

chapters should be invited to participate in your field firearms training

programs, police schools, and other Bureau functions.

• To assist the host Florida Chapter in Miami, each Special

Agent in Charge of field offices located in states making up Section II

• should make certain that all eligible graduates in their territories

are aware of the retraining session in Bal Harbour and have notified

the secretary of their own chapter whether they expect to attend.

Any graduate in good standing is welcome to attend Sectional

Retraining Sessions whether or not he works in that section. Any

graduate expecting to attend the Sectional Retraining Session in 1969

should be advised to make proper reservations through the host chapter

without delay. Each SAC must give his personal attention to stimulating

interest in not only the Sectional Retraining Session in Florida but also

each of the other chapter retraining sessions.

(E) PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION;+ U. S. ATTORNEYS AND THE

EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR U. S. ATTORNEYS -- One of our field offices

on a confidential basis obtained a copy of captioned document which was

prepared by the Department of Justice. It is probable other U. S.

Attorneys have received a copy of this document.

-In-summary, the Department apparently prepared this

document in an effort to consider certain prosecutive priorities

recognizing the increase in Federal crime and the limited manpower

available to prosecute violators.

Some of the views set forth in this document were previously

brought to the Bureau's attention, and we submitted our observations

relative to those items falling within our jurisdiction and interest. With

reference to the proposal concerning prosecution of interstate Trans-

portation of Stolen Motor Vehicle (ITSMV) subjects, we have told the :

Department that we feel that prosecution of ITSMV violators should

not be restricted to commercial cases and aduits but rather each case

should be considered on its individual merits. Our expression has

never been acknowledged by the Department.

It would appear the items concerning prosecution as set

forth in the captioned document are suggestions which could be followed

and are not at this point binding on all U. S. Attorneys. We know from

experience that many U. S. Attorneys continue to authorize Federal

prosecution for ITSMV violators in other than commercial cases and in

aggravated situations where juveniles are involved.

This is being brought to your attention so you will be aware

of this document and the Bureau's position with regard to prosecution

of ITSMV cases.

(G) DESERTER MATTERS - SANCTUARY SITUATIONS -- There have been

several instances in the recent past where servicemen have taken so-called

"sanctuary" in churches or other public buildings.

The Department of Defense has issued instructions to all

branches of the military which clarifies the jurisdiction for this type of case.

Briefly, the responsibility remains-with the military to apprehend deserter

fugitives in all instances where both deserter jugitives and other absentees

are present in the same "sanctuary" since it has the authority to arrest

both deserters and those in absent without leave status. The Bureau will

only make the apprehension where the deserter fugitive investigation was

in progress prior to the time information is developed that the fugitive is

in a so-called "sanctuary" and there are no other military absentees present.

If we have been investigating a deserter and he takes sanctuary while we

are looking for him, we will handle the sanctuary situation.

You should be alert in this type of case to any possible violation

of Title 18, Section 1391, United States Code: (FBI Handbook, Part III,

page 83b) for harboring a deserter, enticing or procuring desertion or

refusal to give up a deserter upon demand of an authorized officer. Facts

indicating a possible violation of this statute shöuld be presented to the

United States Attorney.

(H) CIVIL SERVICE STATUS - NATIONAL GUARD TECHNICIANS - -

Effective 1-1-69, National Guard technicians will assume status as civil

service employees of the Department of the Army and the Department

of the Air Force in conformance with provisions of Public Law 90-486,

the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968. The implication of these

employees in allegations relative to fraud, bribery, or related violations

would, subsequent to 12-31-68, bring such activity within the possible

scope of Federal criminal statutes. Of course, allegations relating to a

period prior to 1-1-69 would have occurred while such individuals were

state employees and should continue to be referred to the appropriate

authorities.

(I) INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF EXPLOSIVE AND

INCENDIARY DEVICES BY TERRORISTS - SABOTAGE -- For your pos-

sible assistance in sabotage or other investigations within the Bureau's

jurisdiction involving explosive or incendiary devices, there are attached

for each office two copies of a translated reproduction of instructions

in Spanish reportedly seized by the Venezuelan National Guard from a

terrorist. Believed to be of Cuban origin, these instructions relate to

the preparation of components as well as finished explosive and incendiary

devices.

/

Bureau experience with bombing matters has not revealed any

specific instances where the device used was prepared from these in-

structions. Nevertheless, they should be brought to the attention of

investigative personnel and should be considered by them during investi-.

gations as noted above, particularly where Cubans (either pro-Castro or.

anti-Castro) or Cuban-udined suspects are involved. In the latter

category might be included also any extremist militants of the New Left -

or Black Power movements who may have visited Cuba, received training

there, or who have Cuban contacts with subversive backgrounds. Any

--

specific example or indication that a device was prepared from these

instructions should be brought promptly to the Bureau's attention.

The foregoing in no way alters standing instructions concern-

ing the handling of explosives by Bureau personnel. As in the past, they

should be guided in such matters by instructions in the Agent's Handbook,

Part III, Chapter 65, page 160, and the Manual of Instructions, Section

86, pages 5 and 7.

(A) BỌY SCOUTS OF AMERICA SPECIAL INTEREST EXPLORER

POSTS - COOPERATION WITH -- The Chairman of the United States

Civil Service Commission has furnished information concerning Boy..

Scouts of America Special Interest Explorer Posts, which the Depart-

ment has requested we bring to the attention of all FBI Field Divisions.

The program is designed to bring the principles of scouting to inner

city, disadvantaged youth by the establishment of these special posts,

sponsored by various organizations. The Federal Executive Boards

(FEB) have been urged to sponsor some of these posts. The Department

asked that the FBI support the Boards in this effort.

While the Bureau is in accord with the aims of this program,

it is not desired that any FBI Office act as official sponsor for any

Boy Scout group. Should you be approached by either the Boy Scouts

or a representative of the FEB. our cooperation should be limited to

providing Bureau speakers and offering tours of FBI facilities.

(B) NEW LEFT MOVEMENT - POLICE TRAINING MATTER - -

Recently various field offices have proposed that Special Agents familiar

with the New Left movement speak before groups of local law enforcement

personnel concerning this movement. The Bureau is of the ppinion

that such talks or briefings concerning the New Left movement would

be beneficial to both the FBI and law enforcement; however, should be

handled by a qualified speaker from the Seat of Government familiar-

with all current and national facets of this movement as well as being

completely versed in Bureau policy.

The Bureau will, therefore, consider on a highly selective

basis requests from the field to send a qualified representative to speak

before closed meetings of local law enforcement personnel. This talk

would best be handled in conjunction with a school or conference con-

cerning other police matters. The field office requesting a Bureau

speaker in this matter should have strong control over the school or

conference. Submit request setting forth date of school or conference:

the number of law enforcement personnel attending, and your comments

on why you feel this talk would be. a benefit to this particular group..

This should not be interpreted to mean that the Bureau is

soliciting invitations for wide-spread participation in briefing of local

law enforcement personnel in regard to New Left matters. To the

contrary it is felt that briefing of this nature should be held to a minimum

and should only be given to command level law enforcement administrators

on a very selective basis. I personally intend to examine each and every

request for a briefing of this type to insure that it is worthwhile and

justifies the time, effort, and expenditure of money necessary to handle

such commitments.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

You should continue to insure that only those applicants who

personal appearance, personality ana maturity are recommended for

the Special Agent position.

As you are aware, there is a continuing need for qualified

Special Agent applicants from minority groups, especially Negroes. In-

this regard, every logical source should be fully explored particularly

military separation centers.

I wish to re-emphasize the need for careful and penetrative

screening in the initial stages of processing to insure that only those

applicants who have far-above-average potential are considered for the

Special Agent position. In connection with the processing of applicants,

you should insure that the application is completely executed, that all

periods of time are accounted for and that where appropriate, selective

service status is completely resolved prior to forwarding papers to:

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

CASES - FBI FORM BOOK -- Effective March 1, 1969, all automobile

recoveries in Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle (ITSMV)

cases will be reported-on-the-FĐ-387 (Deferment of-Prosecution Form) --

or the FD-410 (Automobile Recovery Form). You are to report automobile

recoveries in accordance with the following instructions:

(1) ITSMV cases deferred to local prosecutors. Report

automobile recoveries on FD-387. This form has been revised to add

a space for reporting recovery value of a vehicle and the source of that

recovery value. In addition, the brief statement of facts on this form

must include information showing the stolen vehicle was transported inter-

state, its model year, make, and Vehicle Identification Number.

(2) All other ITSVIV cases, including cases with more than one

investigative character. Peport recovery of vehicles on FD-410. This

form is to be completely filled in and has sufficient spaces for data on it

to allow the Bureau to record your automobile recoveries. The spaces

for this data are all self-explanatory. At the bottom of the form is a

space entitled "Give Brief Summary of Investigation Conducted to Date:"

in which you are to set forth in teletype language a succinct summary of

the investigation conducted by your office in order to insure field and

Seat of Government supervisory personnel that the case has received

appropriate investigative attention. Two copies of the FD.-410 are to be

furnished to the Bureau.

With the automobile recovery reported on either the FD-387

or the FD-410, there will be no need to submit investigative reports in

cases deferred to local prosecutors or in unknown subject ITSMV cases

where all logical investigation has been completea in the initial 90 days

of investigation, and may be closed on the authority of the Special Agent

in Charge. In known subject ITSMV cases, it will be necessary to sub-

mit an FD-410 and an investigative report. In no instance will an auto-

mobile recovery be reported in an investigative report for the purpose

of recording at the Bureau in any ITSMV case.

Intrastate stolen vehicles recovered during the course of our

investigations are to be set forth on FD-410 with proper justification.

(C) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Information has .

recently been received that an individual who is attempting to form a

Black Panther Party organization in Washington, D. C., has suggested

that young members of the Black Panther Party can help identify FBI

informants by gaining the acquaintanceship of FBI female personnel.

This again highlights the ever present danger of infiltration

not only of our informant ranks but also even of the ranks of our

employees. While our investigations and system of operation are

geared to uncover any "plant.

" we must never lose sight of this pos-

sibility, since penetration of law enforcement agencies is a priority

target of these extremist groups. Accordingly, immediately reevaluate

security measures currently in operation in your office to insure that

the security of our operations, files, and identities of informants are

fully safeguarded. Within 30 days of receipt of this letter, advise the

results of your evaluation.

(A) "THE FBI IN OUR OPEN SOCIETY" BY HARRY AND BONARO

OVERSTREET -- W. W. Norton Company has just published "The

FBI in Our Open Society" by Harry and Boraro Overstreet. This is

an excellent book and portrays the FBI in a most favorable way. Dr.

and Mrs. Overstreet, weil-known scholars and educators, have

carefully studied and refuted the false charges made against the Bureau

by such vicious critics as Max Lowenthal, Fred J. Cook and William

W. Turner. The Overstreets emphasize that the operations of the FBI

do not in any way represent a threat to the freedoms of our free and

open society and that charges that the Bureau is a national police

agency are completely false. The book is highly readable, intellectually

stimulating and extremely lucid..

• The Bureau has made arrangements with W. W. Norton

Company to secure copies of this book for sale to employces at the

special discount rate of $3.75.

You should survey your personnel and advise the Bureau

promptly of the number of books to be sent to your office. All initial

orders should be submitted by routing slip marked "Attention, Crime

Records Section" and should be accompanied by one check payable to

the FBI Recreation Association covering the entire order. Subsequently,

of course, additional orders can be submitted in the same manner.

In order to facilitate the handling of orders, one employee

should be designated in each office or section at the Seat of Government

to coordinate the orders. All books mailed will be addressed to the

SAC but should be distributed in the various offices by the employee

handling orders. The Bureau should be notified if books ordered are

not received within a few weeks so they can be traced through the mails.

Keep in mind this instruction in no way lessens your

responsibility to insure money expended for criminal informant

development is on a C.O.D. basis and that full value is received for

all funds disbursed. You should thoroughly scrutinize every request

to pay criminal sources and make certain all payments are completely

(A) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY - 84TH SESSION -- By April 1, 1969,

you should submit to the Bureau, Attention: Training Division, the names

of candidates from your territory whom you desire to recommend to

attend the 84th Session of the FBI National Academy, which convenes

August 18, 1969, and will graduate November 5, 1969. A specific state-

ment must be made concerning the review of your field office indices on

the applicants and their law entorcement agencies in the letter listing

your candidates.

Alternate candidates who were investigated for the 83rd Session

of the National Academy and not invited to attend that session in view of

lack of space will be considered the principal candidates for the 84th

Session of the National Academy from the field offices covering their law

enforcement agencies.

• * 27?

All candidates nominated for the 84tn Session must have been

interviewed by the current Special Agent in Charge.. It such has not been

done, appropriate interview iorm should be submitted along with your

recommendations. It is expected that only outstanding candidates who

have a potential in the training or administrative fields will be nominated.

Since the Bureau now pays travel and subsistence allowances to attendees,

those offices covering more than one state should, where feasible,

nominate a candidate from each of those states.

(B) LEAVE - CHANGES IN POLICY -- One year's Bureau service will

no longer be required as the minimum for an employee to qualify for

maternity leave. Six months' service will henceforth suffice for this

purpose.

The requirement enunciated in SAC Letter 69-3 that all requests

for leave without pay would require Bureau approval is hereby modified.

Only those requests for leave without pay exceeding one day will require

such approval. This change in no way broadens the reasons for which

leave without pay can be granted; it simply relieves division heads of the

necessity for securing Bureau approval of leave without pay of a day or

less for those purposes for which Bureau policy has previously provided

leave without pay. Any request for leave without pay not included within

those purposes will require Bureau approval even though it may be for

one day or less.

(C) ASSOCIATED CREDIT BUREAUS, INC. -- The Associated Credit

Bureaus (ACB), Inc., which is a trade association, and has some 2100

member credit bureaus, has issued guidelines to protect consumer privacy.

One of the guidelines pertains to service to noncredit granting govern-

mental agencies. The guidelines provide that member credit bureaus

may supply to those agencies under contract identifying information-

such as names, addresses, former addresses, places of employment

or former employment. Any other information in credit bureau files will

be supplied only in response to legal process unless the investigation

is for security purposes.

A source at ACB has advised that these guidelines would affect

the FBI; however, they are worded broadly enough not to stop credit

bureaus from furnishing the necessary information. Certain types of

to furnish the requested intormation without contract or agreement, the

issue should not be raised. In those instances where member credit

bureaus will not furnish such information without some agreement along

the line of the above guidelines, you are authorized to sign such an

agreement if it does not go into such matters as a membership fee and

other charges. A copy of each such signed agreement should be furnished

(D) FLEX-CUF TIES - TEMPORARY RESTRAINING DEVICES -- For-

warded under separate cover is a supply of white nylon flex-Cuf Ties

with an appropriate number for training purposes with the locking barb

removed. The training ties are dyed a distinctive red color to prevent

-confusion with those that may be used in arrest situations. -Since these

devices can be removed by sustained application of intense flame or

sharp instrument, appropriate searches and subsequent guarding of

restrained persons are paramount, as in the case of any arrest.

It is imperative that all of our Agents receive training in their

use. Field police instructors should atiora training to police agencies

requesting same.

These devices are not meant to replace handcuffs but are an

expendable alternate restraining device to augment the present supply

of handcuffs in your office. They can be made available to Agents, at

your discretion, to be carried in the glove compartment of Bureau cars,

brief cases or on the person.

The August, 1968, issue of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin

sets forth specifications of these devices as well as methods of utilizing

them. The Planning and Research Unit of the Training Division is pre-

paring a Police Instructor's Bulletin with additional techniques for their

application. These ties have a one-time use and must be cut to be

removed. To avoid severe wrist and finger cuts, diagonal or cutting

pliers are recommended to remove them.

(E) NIGHT-VIEWING EQUIPMENT - SURVEILLANCES -- There is

available from the Radio Engineering Section of the Laboratory a new

night- viewing device called the "Starlight Scope." This unit is completely

portable and is packaged in a luggage-type metal carrying case. The

viewing unit operates on one self-contained 6. 75-volt mercury cell which

will give efficient service from 50 to 100 hours, depending upon the

frequency of viewer use. Functioning of this device is based on the

technique of low-light level image intensification or amplification. It

utilizes and amplifies the natural or ambient light radiations (moonlight

or starlight) emanating from the night sky which are reflected by the

scene under surveillance. As a result, no artificial illumination, such

as infrared, is needed to flood the area for night observation.

67-38 advised no warning of rights is necessary so long as the

interrogation of the deserter suspect or subject is confined to

(F) DESERTER MATTERS - REQUEST FOR FOREIGN

INVESTIGATION -- There has been a significant increase in the

fled to Canada and other countries. To facilitate handling the

letterhead memoranda both at the Seat of Government and by the

Legal Attaches, you should insure that the requirements as set forth

in the FBI Handbook, Part I, page 50b, are closely followed.

"Some of the most frequent errors in the preparation of the

letterhead memoranda are: failure to set out specific investigation

required,

requesting that servicemen be interviewed rather than

having their residence verified, use of the property stamp, and

occasionally requesting the arrest of the servicemen.

After setting forth the specific investigation desired, the

letterhead memorandum should request that the deserter fugitive's

presence in the country of asylum be verified. No request for arrest

should be made. Since the letterhead memorandum is to be delivered

to the foreign investigating agency, it should not contain the usual

restrictive property statement.

(H) NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN AMERICA -- Your

attention is directed to SAC Letters 65-31 (A) dated June 2, 1965, and

66-8 (D) dated February 1, 1966, both of which stressed the importance

attached by the Bureau to Latin-American investigations and related

matters in this field.

In the recent past, the press has reported a statement by

a high-ranking United States official that President Richard M. Nixon

plans a trip to Latin America, possibly at the end of this year. The

official described the President as very interested in stepping up

United States economic aid and improving relations with Latin America.

The current attempt of a Presidential envoy to ease the United States-

Peruvian crisis and the projected visits to Latin America on the

President's behalf by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, beginning in

April, 1969, attest to the President's concern.

The Bureau has received no official notification of

Presidential plans for travel to Latin America. However, stepped-up

anti-United States nationalistic influences, increased diplomatic and

commercial relations with Soviet-bloc countries, and efforts of the

latter to promote discord and subversion in the area are likely to

generate continuing and grave problems with ramifications in the

United States.

We should anticipate that the need for pertinent

intelligence data will remain acute in the foreseeable future. Therefore,

, the Bureau is stressing at this time the necessity for adequate coverage

of Latin-American exile organizational activities, plots to overthrow

existing governments, and general activity of importance from an

intelligence standpoint. Significant developments should be reported

expeditiously:

John Edgar Hoover

Detailed information and instructions concerning the program are being

furnished separately in the form of a Memorandum to All Employees.

An initial supply of SF-1189 and SF-1198 is being forwarded

to your office under separate cover. The SF-1189 is the prescribed

Standard Form to be used in requesting an allotment of not pay for credit

to a checking account with a designated financial organization. The

SF-1198 is the Standard Form to be used in requesting an allotment of

pay for credit to a savings account with a financial organization. Should

you need additional forms they may be requisitioned from the Bureau.

You should assure that all employees of your office carefully

read the instructions being forwarded to them before making any allotment

in order that they will be fully aware of the procedures to be followed and

the possible difficulty they may encounter.

Your office can be of considerable assistance in the

implementation of this program by insuring that each request is properly

executed before it is submitted to the Bureau. In forwarding the allotment

requests to the Bureau, the transmittal communication should be marked

to the attention of the Voucher-Statistical Section.

(D) BANK LARCENY -- The Criminal Division of the Department recently

advised that false statements by a person which induce a bank to turn over

the possession of funds to that person, but where there is no intention on

the bank's part to convey title, constitute a crime of larceny by trick in

violation of 18, U.S. Code, 2113 (b). An example is a person who falsely

poses as an armored car employee authorized to pick up certain funds

for delivery to a stated place, and by the impersonation induces the bank

to relinquish possession of the funds. The bank did not intend to deliver

title to the impersonator, just as it had no intention to deliver title to the

armored car employee. Title remained in the bank. Abuse of title is

larceny and, as such, is covered by 18, U.S. Code, 2113 (b).

The Department reiterated its position that larceny by false

pretense, that is, the obtaining of both possession and title by fraudulent

representation, (quick change artist, fake rolled coins, fraudulent

passbook withdrawals, etc.) is not covered under the Federal Bank Robbery

and Incidental Crimes Statute. In these situations the bank intends to

transfer title of the money to the person making the lalse representation.

In situations which arise where there is doubt whether the act

committed constitutes larceny under the Federal Bank Robbery Statute,-

the U. S. Attorney should be consulted and the Bureau advised.

Gus Hall, General Secretary of the Communist Party, USA, (CPUSA)

remarked that a Party-supported trade-union publication would be issued

in the near future and would appear under the name "Labor Today."

On January 5, 1962, records in the Assumed Name Section

of the County Clerk's Office, Wayne County, Detroit, Michigan, indicated

Certificate Number 145344 issued for conducting business under an

assumed name, was issued to "Labor Today" (a bimonthly publication)

having a business address at 12065 Wyoming, Detroit 4, Michigan. A

certificate was filed on January 2, 1962, and the names of the persons

listed as owning, conducting and transacting the business were Charles

H. Walters, 9309 Memorial, Detroit, Michigan, and Eve Neidelman,

19972 Marlowe, Detroit, Michigan.

A second source advised on December 15, 1961, that

Charles Walters was then a member of the Michigan District CP State

Committee. This source advised on September 18, 1959, that Eve

Neidelman was then a member of the Michigan District CP State

Committee.

A third source advised on January 18, 1966, that as of

December 31, 1965, Eve Neidelman was a member of the Miscellaneous

Jewish Community Club, Michigan District CP.

The Founding Statement contained in the first issue of

"Labor Today" (Spring, 1962) indicated two additional issues would be

forthcoming in 1962, and beginning in 1963, "Labor Today" would appear

regularly as a 'bimonthly journal. "

The masthead of "Labor Today, " Volume 8, Number 1,

February, 1969, issue states that "Labor Today" is presently being

published monthly except August by "Labor Today Associates, " a

(G) RACIAL AND SECURITY INFORMANTS -- Recently an informant

voluntarily advised a police officer who was investigating a case that he

was assisting the FBI. While this police officer has maintained the

confidence of the above information, this incident should not have occurred.

There has been another incident where an informant has voluntarily

disclosed his identity as a source of this Bureau and his actions were not

in keeping with the Bureau's system of controlling and directing the

informants.

In view of the above, each Special Agent in Charge must

insure that Special Agents operating informants impress on these

informants the necessity of informants maintaining the confidential nature

of their relationship with the FBI.

It should also be impressed upon the informants that in the

event they have any doubts as to what course of action to take, they should

immediately contact a representative of the FBI and be guided by the

instructions given to them.

In addition, each Special Agent handling informants must

afford these informants close supervision and control so that incidents can

be avoided which may affect Bureau operations.

Each Special Agent in Charge is being held personally

responsible to insure that the Special Agents assigned to his division are

affording the informants being operated by them tight supervision and

control in accordance with the above.

Furthermore, I want each Special Agent in Charge to impress

upon Special Agents dealing with individuals, whether they are Bureau-

approved informants or those voluntarily contacting your office, who

provide information about the New Left, that every interview must be

on a most discreet and completely professional basis. Also, extreme

caution should be used at all times to be certain that the individuals

are not plants. All conversations should be most circumspect because

of the possibility uf the conversations being recorded. Individuals who

have not been approved by the Bureau as intormants shouid not be

(C) STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY - SUBVERSIVE ORGANI-

ZATION CHARACTERIZATION -- Set forth below is a current characteri-

zation of Students for a Democratic Society which should be utilized in

the future when it is necessary to characterize this organization in

investigative reports and other types of communications.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic -

Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into being at a founding

convention held at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 1962. From an

initial ideological posture of "participatory democracy," the current

line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

Michael Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the

building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement. The program

of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war position and finally to its present advocacy of an anti-

imperialist line, linking up the oppressed peoples of Asia. Africa and

Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China:

!. Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are leading.

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism. On the

other hand, SDS regaras the Soviet Union as an imperialist power and

does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608 West

Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper "New Left Notes"

reflects the line of the national leadership and program adopted at

meetings of the National Council and National Interim Committee

(NIC) Three national officers and a NIC of eleven members are

elected each year during a June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college chapters

elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and

ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autonomous in

nature and is free to carry out independent policy and programs

reflective of local conditions.

(D) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- With the coming

of summer, many of the radical Negro students on college campuses

who have been creating such havoc will undoubtedly interrupt their studies

for the summer months. The hatred engendered in them by their

campus agitation will undoubtedly follow them into the communities

where they will be living. It is logical to assume that they will continue

to demonstrate their anarchistic feelings by engaging in or seeking to

promote racial violence. The most logical areas for such agitation are

the Negro ghettos.

In view of the above, you must immediately reevaluate your

informant coverage in the gheto areas in your division. In those areas

where such coverage is not already adequate to thoroughly saturate every

level of activity in the ghetto, you must make immediate aggressive

efforts to expand such coverage to adequate levels. This matter must

be given immediate and continuous attention in view of the extremely

costly potential in loss of human lives and property which can resuit

from unchecked racial violence.

Your primary goal in developing a network of ghetto-type

racial informants must be to have such coverage as to enable you to

advise appropriate local and Federal authorities in avance of potential

large scale racial violence. Only by a network of ghetto informants

sufficiently widespread to develop information of that type can the

Bureau fulfill its current responsibilities.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

(A) EM RABIO - RADIO CALL SIGIIDENTIFICATION -- The Manual

of Instructions, Volume I, Section 8Q, 1. e. (2), page 34, requires

field office FM radio stations having a separate dispatching position to

transmit the station call sign on the hour, half-hour, and quarter-hour

during periods when the station is open for business.

Both Ecderal Government and Federal Communications

Commission (ICC) regulations concerning ideuffication of stations

may soon be strengthened as a result of proposed international radio

regulations. To preclude the possibility of receiving infraction reports,

FIV radio dispatchers should be reminded of the importance of proper

station identification. This regulation does not apply to special operations

such as surveillance stations or those where there is an investigative

requirement that no call sign be used.

(B) ORGAlIZED CRIME, RACKETERING - TECHNICAL EXAMINA-

EVIDENCE -- SAC Letter 69-23 dated 4/15/69 stated specific emphasis

should be devoted for the development of cases under the federal

Gambling Statutes and Exid. tionate Credit Transactions. The following

is to be brought to the attention of atl investigative personnel.

The FBI Labotatory has the capability to make technical

examinations of physical evidence and to furnish competent expert

testimony in matters relating to numbers (numbers--pool, policy,

Bolita; Cuba, et cetera), horse racing, lottery in its several forms,

tip boards, et cetera. Further, games and equipment (cards, dice,

electronic and mechanical devices, et cetera) related to the gaming

'industry are examined to determine whether such paraphernalia is

fair or deliberately deceptive via alterations.

Generally, expert testimony will not be furnished on purely

- hypothetical matters or general gambling procedures in cases where

no physical evidence was made avilable for Laboratory examination.

However, this specialized knowledge is available for guidance in these

matters.

• (C) SABOTAGE -- The increased militancy of New Left, antiwar and

antid, aft extremists has been directed against Reserve Officers'

Training Corps (ROaC) on campuses of colices and universities

throughout the United States. These dissident protests have in many

cases resulted in damage to facilities and equipment utilized by ROTC

units.

The Department has determined that such facilities con-

stitute "war premises" or "national defense premises" as defined in

the Sabotage Statutes, Sections 2151 - 2156, Title 18, U. S. Code.

One conviction has resulted.

The investigation of such incidents should be handled in

accordance with procedures and policies set forth in Section 86, Manual

of Instructions. These cases must be vigorously pursued and promptly

reported in order that the Department may be furnished the necessary

information on which it can base a prosecuiive upidivi.

Such incidents often constitute violations of other Federal

laws within the investigative jurisaiction of the Bureau such as

Destruction of Government Property and Interference with Government

Communications System. You should insure that with regard to these

deliberate acts of violence, the possibility of sabotage is thoroughly

explored and that all communications include that character.

(D) OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS ACT OF 1968 --

Recently the Attorney General furnished the Bureau detailed instructions

relating to cluetronic surveillances (wirtiaps and microp'one coverage)

in the internal sccurity field vhich are pertinent to captioned Act. A

summary of the instructions is being furnished herein for your guidance

and compliance.

When requesting authority for an electronic surveillance,

make certain all additional data now required is set forth in Fcrm FD-142.

For reasons of security, electronic surveillances in the

internal security field should be requested under the Presidential

authorization provision of the Act; however, if prosecution appears

likely, consideration should be given to recommending use of a court

order. Basis for the type desired should be clearly set forth.

The Supreme Court's decisions have shown that the legality

of the interception is of prime importance in determining whether

information regarding electronic surveillance must be disclosed to a

defendant whose conversation has been intercepted. Therefore, future

requests for electronic surveillances in the internal security field

should contain:

(1). An identification of the premises and location, and the

room or office, in which the interception device is to be placed or phone

to which such a device is to be attached and facts regarding the instal-

'lation to assist in determining whether a trespass will be involved.

(2). A general description of the activities subject is engaged

in and the type of information which it is anticipated will be obtained

through the electronic coverage.

(3). The period of time for which approval is requested,.

with subsequent advice as to date of installation.

(4). Whether it is anticipated that the conversations of any.

other subject who is under active investigation for possible criminal

violations will be overheard.

With regard to tave recordings of intercepted conversations,

such tapes should be prestived for a minimum period of ten years.

If it is anticipated results will be introduced into evidence

or leads to evidence will be obtained where installation is being

recommended under the Presidential authorization, the following

additional information should be included:

(1). The crime or crimes which it is believed are being

committed by the person or persons whose conversations are likely

to be overheard.

(2). A complete description of the investigation being con-

ducted - its origin, development and present status. This description

should include a detailed analysis of all investigative procedures

utilized and a statement as to their inadequacy and the need to use the

proposed technique.

(3). The names and backgrounds of each prospective subject

of the investigation.

(4). A description of the communications expected to be

intercepted, together with an analysis of the relevance of the communi-

cation to the investigation.

Requests for coverage should be for no longer than a period

, of thirty days, subject, of course, to requests for extension.

Dissemination of intercepted information may be made to

other intelligence and law enforcement agencies and allies of the United

States on a need-to-know basis and should be appropriately classified,

and in no case violate the dissemination limitations which are currently

imposed upon classified national defense information. If evidence of

possible criminal conduct is developed, extreme caution should be

exercised in disseminating the information outside of the FBI and the.

information should be clearly identified as having originated from an

electronic surveillance. If a question should arise whether a particular

item of information falls within or without these general guidelines,

advice of the Department should be obtained as to whether dissemination

should be made.

It is realized that the instructions present certain serious

problems, such as preservation of tapes for a minimum of ten years,

and also certain questions, such as the manner of identitying information

as coming from an electronic surveillance when disseminating infor-

mation of a possible criminal conduct. These and other such matters

will be taken up with the Department for clarification. Pending the

receipt of clarification, however, you should follow the instructions

set out herein to the best of your ability, communicating with the

Bureau in the event a specific situation presents a special problem.

For your information, the Criminal Division of the Depart-

ment is currently preparing a "Manual for Conduct of Electronic

Surveillance" which will contain detailed instructions regarding the

form of, and the information to be contained in, future requests to the

Attorney General for authorization to apply for an interception order

from the courts.

(A) DR. VASSILIS C. P. MORFOPOULOS - EXPERT FINGERPRINT

TESTIMONY - IDENTIFICATION MATTER -- The October, 1968, issue

of "The Legal Aid Briefcase," a publication of the National Legal Aid and

Defender Association, American Bar Center, Chicago, Illinois, published

an article entitled "Some Fingerprints Lie." This concerned a murder

trial in Dutchess County, New York, in which Morfopoulos testified as a

fingerprint expert for the deiense.

Two prosecution fingerprint experts

had testified that a bloody latent fingerprint found on the headboard of the

victim's bed was identical with one of the fingerprints of the defendant.

Dr. Moropoulos testified that it was not identical with the fingerprint of

the defendant. The article extolled the expert testimony of Moriopoulos

and attempted to cast serious doubt on the infallibility of fingerprint

evidence.

=-----

FBI ingerprini experts have examined fingerprint evidence

in this case and found that the latent fingerprint is identical with the

fingerprint of the defendant. A letter of rebuttal has been sent to the

President of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association setting out

the true facts and correcting the erroneous impression conveyed by the

article with the suggestion that the letter be published in a future issue of

"The Legal Aid Briefcase."

Morfopoulos' qualifications as a fingerprint expert are deemed

to be questionable. He is described as being a Greek immigrant who

entered the United States in 1955 to attend school. He has a degree in

•engineering science and is presently Director of the American Standards

Testing Bureau in New York City, a private concern. While his educa-

tional background appears extensive in certain scientific fields, he has

practically no background or experience in fingerprint work. He describes

himself as a microscopist, one who observes objects through a micro-

scope.

Should any information concerning this matter or the partici-

pation of Moropoulos in the field of fingerprint identification or testimony

come to your attention, you should promptly advise the Bureau.

(B) LAW ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION - GRANTS AND LOANS -- The

Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 authorized a

program of educational aid to law enforcement officers and students

planning law enforcement careers. The Office of Academic Assistance,

of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, has just issued basic

information which should be made available to interested Special Agent

and clerical personnel of your office.

The educational aid is in the form of (1) grants and (2) loans.

Grants pay up to S300 per semester or $200 per quarter for eligible law

enforcement officers taking courses related to law enforcement. "Courses

related to law enforcement" are, for example, sociology, chemistry,

economics, computer science, and urban planning. The official interpre-

tation of "law enforcement officers" includes FBI Agents but not our non-

Agent personnel. Money is paid to the educational institution rather than

to the student. The student must get his employer's certification that

the courses are of the appropriate kind and that he is employed as a law

enforcement officer. He must agree to remain with his agency for two

years following completion of any course covered by a grant. If he

violates the agreement he must repay the amount of the grant with 7o

interest. He cannot receive education benefits from the Veterans Admin-

istration concurrently.

/ Loans of up to $1800 per academic year can be made to full-

time students employed by a law enforcment agency or preparing to enter

law enforcement.

A 'full-time student" is one carrying at least 75° of

the normal academic load. He must be pursuing studies leading to a

certificate or degree in an area directly related to law enforcement. If

he is enrolled in studies potentially relevant to other areas as well as law

enforcement such as chemistry, sociology, or economics, his overall

• curriculum must include a minimum of 15 semester credit hours or their

equivalent in law enforcement subjects. Examples of the latter are

criminal investigation, police administration and organization, criminology,

juvenile delinquency, and police community relations. A loan does not

prevent the student's réceiving concurrent GI education benefits. He must

agree to repay the loan plus 7.e interest within ten years after the repayment

begins. The total amount of the loan and interest is cancelled, if he serves

as a full-time law enforcement officer or employee, at the rate of 25'c

of the total for each full year of service. The borrowed money goes

directly to the participating educational institution, not to the borrower.

FBI clerks are potentially eligible to obtain such loans, which could help

them complete college studies designed to qualify them for the Special

Agent position.

Any employee desiring to apply for a loan or a grant should

contact the school of his choice to see if it is participating in the program

and if so as to the application procedure. Any documents required to be

executed by the employer should be forwarded to the Bureau, attention

Personnel Section, with a cover letter detailing the circumstances. It

now appears no such documents will be necessary for loan applications,

but the Bureau desires to be informed by you of any such applications for

record purposes, communications of this type also being directed to the

attention of the Personnel Section.

(DESECO) -- Effective immediately, the following streamlining

procedures should be followed in this program, which is designed to

develop individuals on a highly selective basis for eventual penetration

of Soviet-bloc intelligence activities.

If, during the "sounding-out" interview, the Deseco subject

• clearly exhibits a willingness and potential to cooperate with the Bureau,

he should be informed of our desire to have him participate in

• confidential activity in support of the Bureau's responsibility for the

protection of the internal security of the United States. He should

clearly understand that this cooperation may require his time and

effort beyond his normal occupational endeavors.

This procedure should assist in resolving that the individual

is ready, willing; and able to actively assist the Bureau and insure that

our ensuing background investigation is necessary and worthwhile.

It he continues to be cooperative and willing to assist the

Bureau actively, and the ensuing background investigation of him is

favorable, a summary of the results of the "sounding-out" interview

and background investigation should be submitted to the Bureau, advising

on a UACB basis that he will be recontacted to further assess his •

potential and availability, and specifically informed of our desire to

have him develop a relationship with a Soviet-bloc official. All other

MATTERS - Regulations issued pursuant to the Bank Protection

Act of 1968 require that effective July 15, 1969, "bait" money be

maintained by banks and that the 'bait" money consist of used

Federal Reserve notes.

Some offices have in the past suggested to banks that

Federal Reserve notes issued in distant Federal Reserve districts

be used as "bait" bills in order to make "bait" bills more noticeable.

For example, banks in Texas might use as "bait" money Federal

Reserve notes issued by the Federal Reserve in San Francisco

because few such bills will be in circulation in Texas.

The Federal Reserve System has advised that some of

the Federal Reserve Banks have recently been requested by

commercial banks to supply used currency from another Federal

Reserve district for use as "fait" bills: The Federal Reserve:.

is not set up to handle these transactions and desires that banks

obtain used Federal Reserve notes issued in other districts

by contacting a correspondent bank rather than a Federal

Reserve Bank.

You should keep the above in mind when discussing

"bait" bills with bankers in your territory.

(A) OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS ACT OF 1968_-=

Reference is made to SAC Letter 69-31 of June 3, 1969, captioned as

above.

/ Tape recordings of conversations deemed sufficiently pertinent to

monitor through electronic surveillances (elsurs) (wiretaps and micro-

phone surveillances) are to be made whenever feasible when coverage is...

authorized for intelligence purposes in the internal security field.

Particular effort should be made to record on tape the conversation of

an individual who is known to be a subject in a Federal criminal case.

Whenever the intercepted conversations clearly contain no.

evidence or leads to evidence of criminal conduct, the tapes need not be.

retained atter they have served the needs of your office. However, the

Department has pointed out that frequently it is required to disclose to

the court and sometimes to defense counsel recorded conversations of a

defendant in a Federal criminal case to refute the contention that infor-

mation relevant to that case was obtained through elsur. Therefore, the

Department has suggested that when an individual whose conversation is

being monitored is known by monitoring personnel or by the Special

Agent who prepares a summation of the conversation to be the subject

in a Federal criminal case, the taped recording or a verbatim transcript

of the conversation should be retained whenever possible.

The Department has further instructed that when an individal

becomes a defendant in a Federal criminal case, every effort should be

made to avoid monitoring his conversations through elsurs. Equal effort

must be made to avoid monitoring any and all conversations of anyone

known to be serving as an attorney for a defendant in a Federal criminal

case.

Therefore, whenever an elsur is operated in a substantive case

in which current or future prosecution in a Federal court is or may be

involved, monitoring should be conducted by a Special Agent or Special

Employee. The monitoring personnel must be instructed in writing that

they must immediately cease monitoring, both in person and by electronic

recording, any conversation as soon as it becomes clear that the parties

thereto are either a defendant or an attorney of a defendant in a Federal

criminal case.

- NW. 55041_.DoaId: 32989525

Page 795

## Page 796

It is recognized that it is impossible to make monitoring person-

nel aware of all defendants and their attorneys in all existing or

contemplated Federal criminal cases. Our efforts must be directed at

surviving the test of whether our approach was logical, reasonable, and

practical. It is logical and reasonable to expect that as a practical matter

our monitoring personnel should be aware of the identities of the defendants

and their. attorneys in substantive.cases where elsurs are.being used.and

prosecution is contemplated. To further insure that they do they must be

provided with a list of such defendants and their attorneys. They should

also be instructed that they must be alert not to monitor other individuals

in the same categories aside from the substantive case when there is

reasonable basis for the possible future contention that it was generally

publicly known that such individuals were involved in prosecutive action

in a Federal court.

The monitors should be instructed that in such situations they are

to make a notation in the log, as appropriate, that the conversation was

cut off and was not overheard, after identifying the name of the defendant

or attorney who was conversing which occasioned the cut-off. Further-

more, any time a conversation relating to defense strategy or tactics;

between any two persons, takes place, the conversation should be immedi-

ately cut off as soon as the subject matter of the conversation becomes

apparent. The same procedure should be followed with respect to

monitoring in other cases in which it may be reasonably expected calls

will be received from defendants or attorneys involved in current or

future prosecution.

If a conversation of a defendant or one of his attorneys should in-

advertently be overheard and later comes to the attention of a Special

Agent, that Special Agent shall immediately seal the record of the con-

versation, attaching a memorandum certifying that he has not and will

not orally or in writing relate the substance of the conversation to

any other representative of the Government or to anyone else except

upon order from the Attorney General. This sealed log and the Agent's

certification should immediately be forwarded to the Bureau for trans-

mittal to the appropriate Assistant Attorney General.

Elsur logs should be confined to: basic entries of dates, time,

identification of individual to monitored conversations; notification made

that monitoring ceased when one of the parties to the conversation was

recognized as a defendant in a pending Federal criminal case or an

attorney of such individual; identity of person monitoring; and identity

of reel number and location of the conversation on the reel.

Summations of contents of conversation are to be prepared only

by Special Agents after reviewing tapes, notes and logs, except in those

instances when a foreign language is involved. In such instances the

summations are to be prepared by personnel who handle foreign language

translations.

Indexing of names is to be made from the summation rather than

from the logs.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

August 19, 1969

(A) CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - ACCOMPLISHMENTS -- As you

are aware, many investigative demands are being made of the Bureau

necessitating the increased use of manpower. There is no indication

that this situation will abate. These increased responsibilities make it

mandatory that you devise procedures which will insure all matters within

our investigative jurisdiction are promptly and adequately investigated

followed by timely, well-organized presentations to United States

Attorneys.

During the past year with the change in the administration, many

new United States Attorneys and Assistant United States Attorneys have

been appointed. Others are being appointed on a continuing basis. It

is your responsibility to thoroughly indoctrinate new United States

Attorneys and their assistants. It is incumbent on you to stress the

desirability to prosecute all violations within our investigativejurisdic

tion. You must closely follow the personnel situation not only in the

United States Attorneys' offices but also with regard to Federal judges.

In the event shortages or other situations exist which have an effect on

the handling of our cases, the Bureau should be immediately advised.

The Bureau's preeminence in the law enforcement field was built

on performance and results. Notwithstanding certain factors which at

first glance would seem to be beyond our control, I expect you to exert

every effort to insure our investigative record at the close of the current

fiscal year will withstand close scrutiny from any source.

(B) CIVIL DISORDERS - RIOTS AND DISTURBANCES - Pursuant to

a Civil Disturbance Plan adopted by the Department of Justice, a Civil

Disturbance Group has been newly established in the Office of the

Deputy Attorney General to coordinate all activities connected with

civil disorders. One of its principal functions is the evaluation of

intelligence data in order for the Attorney General to make a judgment

as to the necessity for dispatching Departmental Civil Disorder Task

Forces to areas experiencing-serious civil disorder.- You were pre-

viously advised of the establishment of the Task Forces by airtel to all

SACs dated May 8, 1969, captioned "Departmental Civil Disorder Task

Forces."

The Department is fully dependent upon the FBI for the collec-

tion and prompt reporting of intelligence data related to threatened or

actual civil disorders. It is also dependent upon the Bureau for assist-

ance in evaluating intelligence data regarding developing situations

having a potential for violence. It is absolutely essential, therefore.

that the Bureau be immediately notified by the most expeditious means

warranted by the urgency of the circumstances of any outbreak of civil

disorder or situations which threaten to expand into mob violence or

riots.

In those instances where the Bureau is initially notified by tele-

phone, a confirming teletype setting forth the available details must be

submitted within the hour and in a form suitable for dissemination. The

Bureau must be kept fully informed of all subsequent pertinent develop-

ments by teletype, or by telephone followed by teletype it the informa-

tion or circumstances so warrant.

I wish to reiterate that in order for the Bureau to carry out its

responsibilities in this extremely critical field, a constant and effective

check on existing conditions which may lead to riots or mob violence

must be maintained. School and campus disorders and the activities of

racial and other types of extremists must be considered in this regard.

Tg accomplish this coverage, full utilization of informants and in-depth

liaison with local law enforcement agencies is essential.

I am holding each SAC personally responsible to see that the

above instructions are fully complied with and to insure that law en-.

forcement agencies in his Division fully understand the importance of the

FBI being immediately notified of any threatened or actual outbreak of

civil disorder. Any delay whatsoever in reporting data in this area to

the Bureau will not be tolerated.

(C) INFILTRATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE

AGENCIES BY BLACK EXTREMIST GROUPS - RACIAL MATTERS --

Information has recently been developed by the Washington| Field Office

that a black extremist leader indicated he had been thinking of recruiting

young black people into his organization with the thought that they could

be infiltrated into the FBI and/or CIA. There is no indication that such

a program had been implemented.-

This again highlights the ever present danger of infiltration of

the ranks of our employees. As you are aware, our investigations and

system of operation are geared to uncover any "plant"'; however, we

must never lose sight of this possibility, since penetration of law

enforcement agencies is a priority target of these extremist groups.

All Bureau Agents should be alert for information indicating

that infiltration as outlined above is being considered or is taking place.

During contacts with informants, this matter should be pursued to

determine if they have any information regarding infiltration by

extremist groups into the FBI, other intelligence agencies, and local

law enforcement. Advise the Bureau promptly of any information

developed.

The next Black Nationalist Movement semiannual report which -

is due 9/10/69 and all subsequent reports should contain all information

developed including contacts with sources and informants regarding

this matter. The results should be set forth under above caption as

Section VI of the report.

John Edgar Hoover

(A) VOUCHERS - MOVING EXPENSES - BUREAU OF THE BUDGET -

CIRCULAR A-56 REVISED JUNE 26, 1969 -- Bureau of the Budget has

issued revised regulations governing additional benefits provided by

Public Law 89-516, approved July 21, 1966, for employees who are

officially transierred. The revised regulations were effective as of June

26, 1969, and are not retroactive prior to that date. A copy of the re-

vised regulations is attached and additional copies in the form of inserts

to the Voucher Guide will be forwarded to your office in the near future.

A summary of the pertinent changes together with the Bureau's

regulations thereon follows:

OVERSEAS TRAVEL OF DEPENDENTS

If a member of an employee's immediate family reaches his 21st

birthday while the employee is stationed overseas and the Government

paid the cost of his transportation to the overseas station when the

employee was transferred, such member may be returned to the United

States at Government expense provided the return travel is performed

within the prescribed time limitation. Heretofore the regulations

prohibited the travel of such member of the employee's immediate family

at Government cost.

COMPUTATION OF PER DIEM

An employee traveling on transfer, or traveling to or from an

overseas duty station on home leave, or returning to his place of resi-

dence in the United States from an overseas duty station for separation,

is now entitled to a claim of per diem regardless of the fact that the

travel time for the trip is less than ten hours. Members of the employce's

immediate family traveling with the employee under these conditions are

also entitled to a claim of per diem. The previous regulations contained

NW 55041 DocId: 32989525

Page 801

---

## Page 802

a ten-hour restriction with respect to the computation of per diem. It

is desired to point out that the elimination of the ten-hour rule does not

apply when travel is incidental to temporary duty. Each per diem claim

under this regulation must be supported by a statement to the effect that

-additional expenses were incurred

TEMPORARY QUARTERS ALLOWANCES (TIME)

The revised regulation extends the period of time during which

the employee may begin his temporary quarters. allowance. The

temporary quarters claim must begin not later than 30 days from the

date the employee reported for duty at the new station or it not begun

during this period, then not later than 30 days from the date the family

vacated the residence at the old station. Previously the 30-day rule for

the starting time of a temporary quarters claim did not include the

condition for the extension of time relating to the family vacating the

residence at the old station. - as

RECEIPT REQUIREMENT FOR TEMPORARY QUARTERS EXPENSES

Receipts are required for lodging, laundry and cleaning expenses-

(except when coin-operated machines are used for laundering and/or

cleaning of clothes). The previous regulations did not specify the

requirement for receipts to support expenses incurred for laundry and

cleaning of clothes.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION

SETTLEMENT DATES

The new regulations now provide for an additional condition

wherein the period of time for the settlement dates on a real estate

transaction may be extended. An additional period of time not in excess

of one year may be authorized or approved by the agency when it is

determined that circumstances justifying the exception exist which

precluded settlement within the initial one-year period of the sale and/or

purchase contract entered into in good faith by the employee during the

initial one-year period. All circumstances used to justify the extension

of time must be set forth in writing. The extension of time will only be

granted in those cases where all facts show that the employee entered

8/26/69

SAC LETTER 69-45

NW 65041 DooId: 32989525

Page

---

## Page 803

into a sale or purchase contract which would have allowed sufficient

time under normal conditions for the transaction to have been completed

within the initial one-year period of time. Each employee's voucher

submitted for real estate transaction expenses wherein the settlement

dates extend beyond the one-year initial time period must be supported

by a statement of information from the employee concerning the causes

for the delay and forwarded to the Bureau with your personal recommen-

dations concerning the merits involved in the case.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES

Several changes have been made to clarify various types of

expenses that are now proper for reimbursement. The cost of a title

insurance policy and legal and related expenses for a title opinion are

now reimbursable. The same types of expenses incurred in both the

sale and purchase transactions are now reimbursable; whereas,

heretofore they were restricted to either the sale or purchase transaction

but not both.

The new regulations eliminate as reimbursable the cost

incurred by the employee in obtaining a loan for the purchase of a

dwelling and also prohibits reimbursement to the employee for expenses

that are determined to be a part of the financial cost under the Truth

end-Lending Act (Public Law 90-321).

(B) ASCERTAINING FINANCIAL ABILITY MATTERS - Your attention

is directed to SAC Letter 69-39 dated 7/22/69 setting the minimum

acceptance amount in Ascertaining Financial Ability (AFA) cases at

$1,500. At the request of the Criminal Division of the Department an

exception is being made concerning referrals for AFA investigations in

connection with criminal fine and appearance bond judgments and the

minimum in these cases is being set at $500. Request for investigation

of criminal fines and appearance bonds involving smaller amounts may

be accepted should a special situation exist. Of course, the $1, 500

minimum acceptance amount will remain in effect relative to all other

requests for AFA investigations. The Department is in the process of

issuing advice to all U. S. Attorneys..

Appropriate Manual and Agent Handbook changes are forthcoming.

(A) INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL, RACIAL AND SECURITY - Your

-attention is again directed-to the-urgent-necessity-to-exercise-the utmost

care and discretion in the selection of individuals for development as

informants. There must be greater stress placed on this important

phase of your informant programs.

Keep in mind that any doubt regarding a potential informant's

emotional stability or veracity should be immediately resolved in the

best interests of the Bureau.

You should afford continuous strong supervision through all

steps of the development and handling of informants. There is like-

wise a need for tight supervision of Agent personnel engaged in the

handling of informants to insure all actions taken are proper and above

criticism. Under no circumstances should favors or gratuities be

accepted from informants or any other action be taken which could

compromise the Special Agent involved or the Bureau.

Any deviation from these instructions will not be tolerated.

Your efforts to obtain adequate informant coverage must be

characterized by good judgment on the part of all Special Agents.

These instructions in no way lessen your responsibility to

insure your office has a continuous and well-planned program to expand

your informant coverage.

Appropriate personnel should be advised with respect to

these instructions.

(A) PAYMENTS TO INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL, RACIAL, AND

SECURITY -- There have been too many instances recently where

the field has requested exorbitant lump-sum payments to informants.

I want immediate positive steps taken to insure that all future

requests are more careiully scrutinized and cut down to a reason-

able and proper level. As you have been instructed in the past, it

is the responsibility of each SAC to closely examine informant

payment requests submitted. It is apparent that scrutiny by you

of lump-sum payment requests has not received adequate. attention.

Unless payments to informants are maintained at reasonable levels

there will have to be a material reduction in the number of incentive

awards made to our own personnel. You are expected to bring this

to the attention of all personnel handling informants, and it will be

incumbent upon vou to see that these instructions are closely followed

in the future.

(A) CONDUCT DURING INTERVIEWS -- It is recognized that Special

Agents often conduct interviews with persons who deliberately become

obnoxious and may go out of their way to irritate and provoke the

Agents. Even under such trying circumstances Agents should remain

calm and in complete control of their speech in order to avoid the use

of any provocative language that a reasonable person could consider

to be offensive.

These observations are to be brought to the attention of

all investigative personnel.

(B) SECURITY AND RACIAL INFORMANTS -- A recent survey conducted

by the Inspection Division of informants and sources on the campuses of

educational institutions determined that there exists a need for tight controls

and great selectivity in this most sensitive area.

Accordingly, no student should be developed as a campus security

or racial informant or source of any type in security or racial matters who

is under the age of 21. In the event there exist highly unusual circumstances

which would warrant an exception, you should submit such a request to the

Bureau setting out full justification.

Upon initial contact with a potential student informant or source,

informant or source should be requested to execute a brief signed written

statement for the field file to the effect that such individual has voluntarily

furnished information to the FBI because of his concern of individuals and

groups acting against the interests of his government and that he understands

that the FBI is not interested in the legitimate activities of educational

institutions.

Also, you will submit a quarterly letter regarding each student

or teacher authorized for contact as a potential informant, informant or panel

source in security and racial matters. This letter should contain details

regarding productivity, citing specific information furnished by the source not

otherwise available to your office from public source material or other avail-

able sources off campus. Sufficient information must be contained in this

letter to justify the continued utilization of the source.

The initial quarterly letters should be submitted by each office

by January 1, 1970, and should be transmitted to the Bureau by cover com-

munication under the caption "Utilization of Informants and Sources at

Institutions of Learning." The cover communication should set forth an over-

all analysis of coverage afforded by campus sources in each division including

the number of informants and sources active and under development at each

educational institution where sources are being utilized. Subsequent letters

should be submitted in a like manner on a quarterly basis.

Requests for payments should not be included in these quarterly

letters. Rules governing such requests remain unchanged and will continue

to be the subject of separate communications.

These instructions in no way lessen your responsibility to insure

that your office has a continuous and well-planned program to obtain neces-

sary coverage at institutions of learning so that the Bureau can fulfill its

obligations.

Appropriate manual and handbook changes are forthcoming.

identical with that of the Remington Model 870 shotgun which will

simplify training with the new weapon. You will be furnished a supply

of 150 grain, metal-cased. •308 ammunition for service use. For

training purposes you will receive a supply of reduced velocity

ammunition, appropriately color-codea, which will permit training

on your present pistol range. A training bulletin regarding this new

weapon will be forwarded in the near future.

Each SAC will immediately advise the Bureau, Attention:

Training Division, the number of Remington Model 81 rifles in his

office, listing by caliber and serial number the condition of each:

excellent, good, or fair. Also advise the number of carrying cases

for the Model 81 rifle and the amount of Remington .30 or .35 caliber

(B) SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - AMERICAN

SERVICEMEN'S UNION -- Set forth below is an up-to-date characteri-

zation of the American Servicemen's Union (ASU) which is believed to

have field-wide application.

On September 20, 1969, a source advised that the ASU,

formed during early 1968, maintains headquarters at 156 Fifth Avenue,

New York, New York. ASU is dominated and controlled by the

Workers World Party (WWP) and is designed to advance WWP efforts

to undermine United States political and military objectives abroad

by fomenting discontent among military enlisted personnel and by

calling for the establishment of a servicemen's union. ASU's chief

propaganda weapon is the publication of "The Bond - The Servicemen's

Newspaper" which is widely circulated at military installations free

of charge and at times unsolicited.

: The source also advised that the ASU's Chairman is Andrew

Dean Stapp, undesirably discharged from the United States Army in

April, 1968. Stapp is a member of the WWP. ASU and "The Bond"

are terms used interchangeably in connection with WWP interests in

military matters. The former has no real existence apart from the

latter since the publication is the primary means of generating interest

among and communicating with servicemen interested in the formation

of a union. The Union does not function as an organization at this

time. It has, however, been given much publicity in each edition of

"The Bond."

A characterization of the WW as set out on page

44 of SAC Letter 69-50 dated September 19, 1969,

will be used in conjunction with the above

Characterization.

(A) SECURITY INFORMANT AND RACIAL INFORMANT PROGRAMS -

R' DUCTION IN COST - The value of productive live informants in the

s curity and racial fields cannot be overemphasized and in this connection

I want to stress that there are many areas where informant coverage is in-

dequate or weak. However, in an effort to cope with an ever-increasing

ost of our operations, particularly in the payments to informants for

vervices and expenses, I want each Special Agent in Charge to undertake

a detailed analysis of his individual security and racial informant programs

in an effort to determine if there are any ways in wnich savings may be

effected through retrenchment, refinement and/or elimination of duplication

of effort.

In approaching this problem, each Special Agent in Charge is

urged to be both critical and constructive. You should consider what is

necossary to your efficient operations as opposed to whai is desirable. How-

ever, it is expected that the productivity of each and every informant will

Se taken into account, bearing in mind that in some instances the primary

value of an informant is to provide corroboration of intelligence received

from other informants. While a system of corroborating iniormation provided

by other informants is essential in determining the validity of our data and the

integrity of newly developed informants and sources, and may be the desirable

manner of cross-checking information, it may be that in some instances back-

up informants are being continued for corroborative purposes even though

integrity and reliability of other primary sources of the same information

have been established. Such practice leans more to the desirable maximum

coverage rather than the more economical necessary coverage and wherever

possible should be eliminated or curtailed.

This is not to suggest that justified payments to established,

productive informants should be arbitrarily reduced in order to achieve savings;

nor should you arbitrarily discontinue informants who may occasionally fur-

nish duplicate or corroborative information but for the most part produce

valuable first-hand intelligence. In particular you should not curtail your

_NW 55041 DocId: 32989525

Page 013

---

## Page 814

informant program as such, although it is recognized that in order to

accomplish a reduction in expenses it may be necessary for you to cut back

the total number of informants being operated by your office in the security

field. Each office should place stress on quality over quantity in evaluating

its informant coverage. In some instances informants being paid on a regular

basis may have authorized amounts reduced to more realistic figures.

1. Other

informants might logically be reduced to the status of confidential sources,

while still others might be discontinued entirely, subject of course to being

reinstated if the circumstances so dictate. Discontinuance of such informants

should of course be accomplished in such a manner that should the need arise,

they may be reactivated.

You should also consider the possibility of redirecting efforts

of any informant whose services, while desirable in one field, may be more

valuable in another area where there is inadequate coverage.

Such redirection

might result in a decrease in activity with an accompanying decrease in the

amount paid to him for services and/or expenses.

It is recognized that of necessity there will be an abrupt decrease

in informant statistics because of cutbacks in the overall informant strength.

However, I feel that this will be more than offset by projected savings which

will be realized.and this will be fully taken into account during inspections of

your office. Cutbacks in individual situations must not result in a letdown on the

part of each individual Agent in his continuing search for well-qualified security

and racial informants and participation by each Special Agent in this important

program will also continue to be examined by the inspection staff.

Within thirty days from the date of this letter each office must

submit to the Bureau by letter captioned "SECURITY AND RACIAL INFOR-

MANT COVERAGE - REDUCTION IN COST" overall results of its detailed

analysis together with its recommendations for measures which will result

in savings in informant costs in the office. Your letter should identify each

case by title and Bureau file number, wherein savings can be effected, to-

gether with the projected sayings and the effect the measure will have on

your informant program. This letter must be immediately followed by

separate letters for individual case files of informants affected. In addition

to recommendation for discontinuance, redirection, reduction in status,

reduction in authorized payments or other action, each letter must specifically

comment as to the possibility of reactivation of discontinued informants

should the need arise and whether the informant offers any potential for re-

direction in another field where informant coverage is weak or inadequate.

(B) MEDICARE - MEDICAID - FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT --

In recent months considerable publicity has appeared in various parts

of the country concerning large-scale frauds and other abuses by doctors,

dentists, hospitals and nursing homes in connection with the operation of

Medicare and Medicaid programs. These abuses relate to alleged mis-

-management by state authorities, charges for services not rendered,

inflated fees, double billings, charges for unnecessary services and

services to ineligible patients. In order to insure unitorm handling by

the field of complaints received concerning the operations of these programs,

and to avoid duplication of investigation, the following is being set forth.

• Medicare is a Federal program enacted July 30, 1965, to provide

hospital and medical insurance to persons over 65 years of age and is

available all over the United States. This insurance program is financed

by monthly premiums and is administered by the Social Security

Administration. Fraudulent claims submitted under this program would

be a violation of Title 42, U. S. Code, Section 408 (Section 208 of the

Social Security Act), which as a general rule would take precedence over

the general criminal traud statutes.

The Social Security Administration has an investigative staff and

has primary responsibility for the administration of Social Security Act

benefits, including the Medicare program. Recent irregularities brought

to light concerning this program have been investigated by the Social

Security Administration.

In view of the foregoing: any complaints received by the field con-

cerning possible frauds or other abuses in the operation of the Medicare

program should be referred to the nearest local oftice of the Social Security

Administration without any investigation.

Medicaid is a grant-in-aid program in which Federal and state

(and sometimes local) governments share the costs of medical care for

people with low income. States design their own programs within Federal

guidelines and benefits vary from state to state. The Department of

Health, Education, and Welfare is responsible for the administration of

the program on the Federal level, whereas state agencies have this

responsibility on a local level. Any complaints received concerning alleged

irregularities in connection with this program should be submitted to the

nearest local office of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare

without investigation.

The foregoing should be brought to the attention of all investi-

gative personnel.

(C) INVESTIGATION OF UNAF FILIATED WHITE RACIAL EXTREMISTS -

RACIAL MATTERS -- Under existing instructions, investigation of white

extremists is restricted to those individuals who are associated with the

Klan or other white hate-type organizations. In view of the recent marked

increase in violent acts throughout the United States on the part of indi-

viduals who are not affiliated with the Klan or other white hate-type

organizations, it is: necessary to modify existing instructions to broaden

the scope of our investigative responsibilities to include these unaffiliated

individuals.

Investigation has established that many of the individuals

involved in these recent acts of violence, although not currently members

of the Klan or other white hate-type groups, did have previous affiliation

with such groups and still maintain their extremist tendencies.

Hereafter, investigation must be promptly instituted on these

unaffiliated white racial extremists and their activities closely followed.

In conducting these investigations, you should be guided by instruc-

tions set out in Section 122A, Volume IV, Manual of Instructions, which

apply to investigations of the Klan and white hate-type organizations and

associated individuals. Appropriate manual and handbook revisions will

be forthcoming.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director.

(B) IMPREST FUNDS - AUDIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1969 -- Treasury

Department regulations require that at the close of the period covered by

a surety bond on Imprest Fund Cashiers, the cash in the hands of Cashiers

or Alternate Cashiers be verified by two disinterested persons, designated

for this purpose by the special Agent in Charge, and that a report of the

same be submitted to the Chief Disbursing Officer of the Treasury Depart-

ment.

The surety bond presently covering our Cashiers and Alternate —

Cashiers was executed for a two-year period, which will expire at the

close of business, December 31, 1969. Accordingly, it wilt be necessary

for you to designate two disinterested employees to audit the Imprest Fund:

of your office on December 31: 1969. Form FD-301 should be executed in

an original and two copies and signed by the individuals making the audit."

The original and one copy should be forwarded to the Bureau, attention

"Budget Unit." This audit cannot be made on any other day, nor can one of

the semiannual audits be used for the purpose.. You are not to interpret this

as eliminating or supersecing either of the semiannual audits. This is an

audit which must be made every two years in addition to any other audits

that are required to be made. The original of this audit report will have to be

forwarded to a different branch of the Treasury Department than that to which

the regular semiannual reports are sent. Also, it is desired to stress

that both of the individuals making the audit must sign the report.

(C) TRAINING - POLICE - ASSIGNMENT OF INSTRUCTORS -- I am

concerned that sufficient care is not being used in the assignment of

police instructors in field schools to insure the most effective use of

our available manpower. Our investigative commitments have never

been as heavy, and I want you to carefully review the manner in which

your police instructors-are assigned-to-avoid the use of an excessive

number of different instructors in any police school commitment. This

should be accomplished by assigning instructor personnel to handle

multiple topics unless some strong reason makes this impossible, such

as when specialized topics are involved.

(D) SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - TRI -

CONTINENTAL INFORMATION CENTER -- Set forth velow is an up-

to-date characterization of the Tri-Continental Information Center

which replaces the one in SAC Letter 69-50.

A source advised on February 18, 1967, that it was announced

at an Executive Board meeting of the Communist Party of Minneapolis:

Minnesota, in 1967, that Mike Myerson was forming an anti-imperialist

center. This center became known as the Tri-Continental Information

Center (TCIC) and maintained an office in Room 640, 1133 Broadway,

New York City.

A second source advised on May 11, 1967, that the TCIC was

founded by Mike Myerson, who attended a Communist Party, USA,

National Committee meeting in June, 1967, in New York City, as a

Communist Party front organization supported by Communist Party

funds.

The TCIC was described in Volume I, Number 1, May, 1967,

issue of the "Tri-Continental Information Center Bulletin" as an

organization established to raise, through education and information, an

anti-imperialist consciousness in the United States--particularly within -

the growing movements for peace, human rights and democracy.

A third source advised on September 26, 1969, the TCIC was

considered defunct as of that time.

(C) FBI NATIONA ALADEMY TRAVEL AND SUBSISTENCE ALLOW-

ANCES -- As you vere advised by SAC Letter 68-47(A), travel and

subsistence expenses were made available under the Omnibus Crime

Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 for local law enforcement officers

from the United States attending the FBI National Academy. Officers

attending in Fiscal Year 1970 received travel and $16 per day subsistence

allowances from the regular FBI appropriations.

Since we assist officers in obtaining housing accommodations

and encourage them to share expenses while attending the National

Academy, we feel that the $16 a day allowance is sufficient at the present

time to handle their expenses while in Washington. The most recent

National Academy class felt that $16 a day was sufficient to handle their

expenses. We will, of course, reevaluate this matter from time to time

and in the event there is any change, you will be advised.

The $16 a day per diem rate will apply to any other officers

attending FBI-sponsored schools in Washington, D. C., wherein travel

and subsistence allowances are authorized.

(D) TITLE III OF THE OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS

ACT OF 1968 -- A review of the use of court-approved electronic surveil-

lance pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

Act of 1968 shows that excellent results have been obtained through

coverage of carefully selected locations.

This legal evidence-gathering technique has been effectively

utilized in organized crime investigations, particularly those relating to

• loan-sharking and gambling operations.

For example, just one operation revealed those in control

were handling $60, 000, 000 per year principally in lay-off action. In

another instance, data irom electronic surveillance enabled the Bureau

to conduct 54 fruitful search-warrant raids involving an extensive

interstate gambling operation.

Insure Agent personnel handling investigations in connection

with the Criminal Intelligence Program and other major criminal investiga-

tions are thoroughly familiar with all aspects of Title III. They should be

continually alert to the possibility of requesting use ot this most effective

investigative technique.

As you know, it is mandatory that probable cause be established

prior to approval of use of electronic surveillance. An analysis of affidavits

which have been approved requesting use of electronic surveillance reveals

that top echelon informants and other sources have made substantial contribu-

tions in establishing probable cause. Keep in mind informants can be of

material assistance in this regard.

In the event you have a specific situation presenting a special

problem with respect to use of electronic surveillance, communicate with

the Bureau.

It is your responsibility to make certain that whenever special

circumstances are existent which completely justify use of electronic

surveillance pursuant to Title III, appropriate action is taken by your office.

arrest on a charge of kidnapping growing out of a racial

incident in Monroe, North Carolina. He published and

broadcast hate-type material in Cuba and China prior

to his return to the United States in September, 1969.

A second source has advised that the purpose of the

RNA is to establish an independent black nation within the

United States, demanding the States of Alabama, Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina in addition to $10,000

per black citizen as payment for 400 years of. ancestral slave

labor.

A third source advised on March 14, 1969, that an

army of the RiA, known as the Black Legion, dedicated to black

freedom and committed to the concept of systematic armed

revolution, has been established. Black Legion members are

expected to participate in military training and engage in

firearms practice.

The RiA plans to establish an underground

Black Legion in addition to an aboveground Black Legion in

order to avoid detection by the police.

REVOLUTIONARY ACTION MOVEMENT

•A source in November: 1964, made available a document

which indicated that the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) was

organized in 1963 by Afro-Americans who supported the revolutionary

objectives of Robert F. Williams and his concept of organized

violence to achieve the liberation of Afro-American people in

the United States.

Williams fled the United States in 1961 following

issuance of a local warrant for his arrest on a charge of

kidnapping growing out of a racial incident in Monroe,

North Carolina. He published and broadcast hate-type

material in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969.

According to this document, RAM oriented its

program to education, political revolution and the organization

of a black political

party with revolutionary objectives, recog-

nizing the need for "black revolution" that could and would

seize power.

This source in September, 1964, advised that RAM

is dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalistic system in the

United States, by violence if necessary, and to its replacement

by a socialistic system oriented toward the Chinese Communist

interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.

In September, 1969, a second source advised that RAM

has ceased to exist in the New Jork City area since the arrests

of some of its leaders and members in 1967 on a number of charges

including the

state crime of Advocacy of Criminal Anarchy.

In October, 1969, a third source advised RAM had ceased

to exist in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which along with New York

City had been its main sphere of activity.

STUDENT NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE

A source advised the Student National Coordinating -

Committee (SNCC), formerly known as the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee, is a normembership organization founded

in 1960, during the civil rights movement in the South.

Under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael, who served

as National Chairman during the period 1966-67, SNCC evolved from

a civil rights oriented group into a full-blown black revolutionary

organization.

A publication entitled "1967 High Tide of Black

Resistance" indicates the year 1967 was considered by SNCC as a

historic milestone for the liberation of black people in the

United States and the year that revolutionaries throughout the

world began to understand more fully the impact of the black

movement. The publication declared that "liberation will come

only when there is final destruction of this mad octopus--the

capitalistic system of the United States with all its life-

sucking tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke the

people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The realities of

black life, together with the recognition instilled in SNCC

workers, forced its members to further popularize the legitimacy

of self-defense and rebellions when oppression became too great."

A second source advised that H. Rap Brown succeeded

Carmichael as National Chairman of SNCC in May, 1968, and served

in that capacity until June, 1968, at which time SNCC reorganized,

creating ten deputy chairmen in an effort to relieve pressure by

law enforcement.

In April, 1969, SNCC moved its national headquarters

from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City, where it is presently

located.

H. Rap Brown announced at a press conference in

New York City on July 22, 1969, that he had been elected

*Chaimart of the Student Nonvivleni Guordinating Committee.

He announced the organization was dropping the word

"Nonviolent" from its title and will be known as the

Student National Coordinating Committee, with a Revolutionary

Political Council functioning as its governing body. Brown,

at that time, stated the use of force is necessary in obtaining

revolutionary goals.

(E) STUDENTS FOR/A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY - SUBVERSIVE

ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION -- Set forth below is a current

characterization of Students for a Democratic Society which should be

utilized in the future when it is necessary to characterize this

organization in investigative-reports-and other types.of.communications.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at a founding

convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an initial

posture of "participatory democracy" the line of the national leadership

has revealed a growing Marxist-Leninist adherence which currently

calls for the building of a revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently,

the program of SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist position.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders of worldwide

struggles against United States imperialism wnereas the Soviet Union

is held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive.

Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expelled. As a

result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its National Head-

quarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, and the PLP faction

set up headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This headquarters

subsequently moved to Boston. Each group elected its own national

officers, which include three national secretaries and a National

Interim Committee of eight. Both the NO forces and the PLP forces

claim to be the true SDS. Both groups also print their versions of

"New Left Notes" which sets forth the line and the program of the

particular faction. The NO version of "New Left Notes" was recently

printed under the title "The Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass

appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within the

NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth Movement

(RYM) I faction, and the RYM II laction. Weatherman is action-oriented

upholding Castro's position that the duty of revolutionaries is to make

revolution. Weatherman is regarded by RYM II as an adventuristic,

12/9/69

SAC LETTER 69-73

- NW 55041 DocId:32989525 Page 836

## Page 837

elitist faction which denies the historical role of the working class as

the base for revolution. RYM II maintains that revolution, although

desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes

organizing and raising the political consciousness of the working class

upon whom they feel successful revolution depends. Although disclaiming

control and domination by the Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two

factions have in the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and

to follow the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-

• Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP faction which

is more commonly known as the Worker Student Alliance is dominated

and controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to identify

themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist philosophy of the

PLP. They advocate that an alliance between workers and students

is vital to the bringing about of a revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters, although

operating under the outlines of the SDS National Constitution, are

autonomous in nature and free to carry out independent policy reflective

of local conditions.

Because of this autonomy internal struggles

reflecting the major factional interests of SDS have occurred at the

chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

(B) DISCONTINUANCE OF FREEDOM SHARE NOTES - The Treasury

Department has advised that issuance of Freedom Share Notes is being

discontinued and applications for such Notes will no longer be accepted.

Freedom Share Notes issued to employees will continue to earn interest

until maturity at the original 5% rate.

It further advises that the interest

rate for Series E Bonds, effective June 1, 1969, has been increased from

46 to 5%.

In the immediate future you will be furnished a list of all

the employees of your office who are now purchasing Freedom Share

Notes. These employees should be personally contacted and advised

that with the first pay period beginning in January, 1970, no deductions

will be made from their salary for Freedom Share Notes after full

purchase price for a Note has been completed. Unless the employee

cancels the authorization in writing, deductions presently authorized for

the combined Freedom Share Note-Series E Bond will be automatically

converted to a deduction for a Series E Bond only. A Series E Bond

will then be issued in a denomination equal to the combined face value

of the Series E Bond and the Freedom Share Note. The amount deducted

will be adjusted accordingly. For example, if an employee is having

$39 withheld for one $25 Series E Bond and for one $25 Freedom Share

Note, the amount of $37. 50 will be withheld for one $50 Bond. The

inscription on the $50 Bond will be identical to that on the previous $25

Bond.

Employees now purchasing Freedom Share Notes who do not

desire the automatic conversion to Series E Bonds only should forward

a signed request to cancel their present authorization no later than

(C) BRIBERY AND CRIMINAL FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS --| This is to again

bring to your attention the necessity of affording Bribery, Fraud Against

the Government, Federal Housing Administration Matters and Veterans

Administration Matters continuous, preferred and thorough investigative

and supervisory attention. Increased federally

financed programs

dealing with poverty, housing, employment, training and education have

placed added investigative demands on the Bureau in recent months. In

addition, there has been a noticeable increase in large procurement type

frauds requiring substantial investigative activity on the part of Bureau

Agents.

Fraud and corruption growing out of Government procurements

and other federally sponsored programs affect the proper and efficient

functioning of the Federal Government, its Departments and Agencies

and cast suspicion on the integrity of Government employees. These

so-called "white-collar crimes" are most serious and usually generate

intense interest by the public, the press and Congress. Other Departments

and Agencies have administrative responsibilities to perform when alleged

violations relate to their personnel or the management of their contracts.

and they frequently withhold administrative action pending receipt of the ..

results of the Bureau's completed investigations. Consequently, it is

most essential that there be no delay by the Bureau in fulfilling its

responsibilities in these cases.

You are reminded that the field's responsibilities are not

ended with the completion of investigations. There must be prompt, full

and well-organized presentations to the United States Attorneys, Cases

warranting prosecutive consideration must be closely followed with the

United States Attorneys to insure that there is no delay in prosecuting

worthy cases. Unnecessary delays either in the investigative or

prosecutive stages can be most embarrassing to the Government and can

seriously jeopardize chances for successful prosecution.

It is desired that you make an immediate, thorough analysis

of the present administrative and investigative handling of these matters

to insure that there is no delay in the initiation and completion of our

investigations of Bribery and Criminal Fraud allegations. Supervisory

and investigative personnel should be made aware of the Bureau's concern

in this regard. The handling of these important matters will continue

to be closely scrutinized at the Seat of Government to insure these in-

structions are fully complied with.

Applicants - A survey has been completed on clerical appointments

declined for the period 1-1-69 through 11-30-69. During this period a

total of 4,213 appointments were offered, 3, 106 clerks entered on duty

and 1, 107 appointments were declined. The percentage of declination

was 26.3°. Reasons given are set forth below.

This survey disclosed no significant changes in the reasons for

declinations as compared to similar surveys conducted in the past. It

demonstrates the absolute necessity of insuring that before an applicant

is placed under investigation, you must be assured that he is sincerely

interested in employment by the Eureau at Washington, D. C.

In view of the great demands already placed on our investigative

personnel. it is essential that appointments are kept at the highest level

of acceptance. Through gonetrative interviews people who have no interest

in Bureau employment or who have not given sufficient thought to ali the

ramifications involved in seeking employment away from home will be

weeded out. As you have been previously advised, contacting the parents

of young applicants to insure that they will allow the applicant to come to

Washington results in a saring of investigative time and cuts down con-

siderably on the number or declinations. You should use this technique

in any instance where it appears that parental approval has not been given

to the applicant.

Recruitment of 1970 Graduates - You are reminded that appointments are

offered as much as six months in advance of the applicant's availability

date; therefore, you should as soon as possible begin the recruitment and

investigation of those applicants who will be available following May and

June graduation. In order to insure expedite processing of the 1970 - -

graduates, the exact graduation date of the applicant as well as his

availability date should be set forth on the Interview Report Form

(FD- 190). If exact date is not known to applicant, determine how many

days he will need following graduation prior to reporting for employment

at Seat of Government. During course of investigation in those instances

where graduation date in unknown, determine same from appropriate

school officials and report it in your airtel summary.

(E) E'BI DISASTER SQUAD ACTIVITIES - The FBI Disaster Squad has

rendered identification assistance in numerous disasters and, because of

the large repository of fingerprints in the Identification Division, has been

successful in identifying many victims through fingerprints. The number

of fingerprint identifications made is governed by the availability of known

fingerprints for the victims coupled with the condition of the remains.

Eighty per cent of the disasters in which the Disaster Squad has par-

ticipated involved aircraft accidents. With the advent of jet aircraft,

the percentage of fingerprint identifications has declined because of

severe incineration and mutilation of the remains. In some aircraft

disasters, Special Agent personnel have interviewed friends and/or

relatives for detailed background information, obtained dental charts

and medical records, and forwarded same to the disaster scene for

the use of dentists and pathologists in identifying those victims not

identifiable by fingerprints. This procedure requires a substantial

amount of Agent time and if followed in the future could place an un-

usually heavy burden on the Bureau with the introduction in early 1970

of aircraft carrying 300 to 400 passengers. Consequently, participation

by the FBI in future disasters will be limited to identitying as many of

the victims by fingerprints as possible and Agent personnel will not be

used in obtaining complete background information concerning each

victim unless such information is needed in a case where the Bureau

has investigative jurisdiction.

This limitation should be clearly

explained to representatives of the carrier, local police or other

requesting agency at the time request for Disaster Squad assistance

(G) EMERGENCY DETENTION PROGRAM -- The Department has ap-

proved a suggestion that Security Index (SI) subjects currently designated

as Priority Ill be maintained separately. For administrative purposes

Priority IlI subjects will continue to be maintained as a portion of the SI

but all decisions relating to such individuals will be made strictly within

the Bureau. Priority I and Priority II subjects will continue to be re-

viewed and approved by the Department. This decision was based on the

Department's intention to consider only those individuals in Priority I

and Priority Il for apprehension in the event the. Emergency Detention

Program is placed in effect.

All SI cards pertaining to Priority Ill subjects should be

immediately separated from those cards pertaining to Priority I and

Priority II subjects and maintained in a separate section of the SI. These

subjects will continue to be designated as Priority III and the criteria for

including subjects in this category will remain the same. The Depart-

ment will be completely divorced from any action pertaining to Priority

III subjects.

This administrative handling of Priority III subjects should not

generate any reevaluation of your SI subjects since any redesignations of

Priorities at this time will be carefully scrutinized at the Bureau.

• Residence and employment of Priority III subjects should be

verified on an annual basis as is the current practice. In connection with

this verification, the case file should be thoroughly reviewed for any

necessary action to be taken including a reevaluation of the subject's

status. This includes removal from Priority III or possible redesignation

as a Priority I or Priority II SI subject.

As investigations are completed regarding additional security

subjects, the investigative results should be submitted to the Bureau by

summary-type report along with your recommendations regarding in-

clusion on Priorities I, I or Ill. Once an individual is approved for

inclusion in Priority Il any pertinent subsequent information may be

urnished by letterhead memorandum. No investigative reports will

be required in Priority Ill cases subsequent to the initial summary-type

report. Reports will continue to be required in Priority I and Priority II

SI cases in accordance with Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions,

With the establishment of this procedure, the maintenance of

the Reserve Index A (RI-A) will be discontinued at the Bureau. The

RI-A will be maintained solely by each field division in the same manner

as Reserve Index B is currently handled.

Manual changes will be forthcoming. All surveys and programs

in connection with Emergency Detention Program should be adjusted

accordingly. Revision of necessary forms will be forthcoming.
