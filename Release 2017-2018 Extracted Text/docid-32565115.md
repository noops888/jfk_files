information:

reluctant to do so, but when advised that BUFALINO had been

one of those attending the Apalachin meeting, WALTER agreed

to do so because he said that he knew that those who had

attended this meeting did not talk.

The subject was taken by

BRUNO to talk to Congressman WALTER. During this meeting

WALTER indicated a knowledge of the subject's immigration

problem.

He asked BUFALINO what type of business he was in,

WALTER

asked him if he could open a factory in his congressional

district because if he did, he (WALTER) could do him a lot of

good with government contracts and the like.

WALTER was asked

WALTER said he would think about this.

During the meeting

WALTER was

reported to have agreed to see what he could do

about helping BUFALINO and his problems with the Immigration

Service.
