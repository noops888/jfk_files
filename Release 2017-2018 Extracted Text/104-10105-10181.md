less a percentage to be rotalned by the IC. An Investi

The Investigation produced no evidence that any

Individual dontions were ever solleited or received and

recomended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the

booke of the Ney Orlenng Exporters Compny be Investigated

for, evidence of personal sala and possible evidenco of

officials of the FDC. Approximately one nonth after the

EmIlIO SANTANA (paragraph T CO! reference nenorandu.)

1. Subject le probably Identifiable wIth Emillo SANTANA

Galindo, who s recruited by dullave In Lecember 1960 18 .

guide for an infiltration team. SANTAl as pale a monthly

enlary under provisions of his Mc until he vas teruinted

on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team

became Inoperable due to occupation of the target ares by

Borlet technicians.

Another compelling reason for SANTAnA'e

ternination sterned fron his untruthful reporting concerning

certain aspects of the team operations.

In an attenpt to establish positive identification,

JHAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (1laml)

Sheriff'e office that an Emillo SANTAMA (no mtronynie)

born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a fugitive tron

Lousian on a federal warrant a Decenter 1965, F3l Sneet

office on & February 1906 and ms presumbly sent back to

Louisian

At the tine of his arrest SANTANA gave hia

address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miant, which is the same

address shown on an old lulgration fun when he was

living in Hiant.

Headquarters files Indicate SANTANA 16

separated from his wife to apparently still rentdes at

the old Miant address. Since SANTANA's date of birth varies

on verlous docents in ala col 11le, the variation In bIrt

not war aborter in i

inte on his arrost sheet te not conclusive. The fact he

did give his former address to the arresting offleers

indicates he 1e Imilio SANTANA Galindo. A 1962 fumigration

JWAVE for identification purposes 11 thie becomes necessary•

Although JIVAVE has had no contact with SANTANA

since his termination, there la a note in station 111e8

dated 23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as hia

employer on an auto credit application.

FRENTS REVOLICIONARIO DE OCRATICO (FRD)

(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FRONT)

1. The IRD was created with Agency assistance,

guidance and financial support in lay 1960 and consister

of several anti-CASTRO sroupE.

The FRD was formed as a

political action, propaganda and uilitary unit.

Initial

actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,

demonstrations, and tripe throughout the Hemisphere to galn

support for the fight against CAsTro.

The IRD also functioned

as the front organization for recruiting the membere of

the Bay of Pigs Invasion force and carried out a massive

progran of social assistance to Brigade 8506 members in

training camps and their fanilies. Although the FRD head

quarters vere based in Miami, delegates were assigned to

other Breas waich included New Orleans, Louisiana, Tampa,

Force, and sexico City, to gather Intelligence and

coordinate Cuban refugee activities.

2.

In late 1960 or early 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL. (CHC) was formed to coordinate and direct FRD

actlultles and this group was headed by Agency and White

House sponsored Dr. Jose MIlD Cardona, assiated by Manuel

ARTINE and DI. Antonio VARONA.

Both the IRD and the CRo

continued to function until October 1961 when the IRD was

completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion

resulting fron duplication of personnel, activities and

funding.

The CHC also had direct access to President

Kennedy and top White House aides.

Bacause of the magnitude

of the FID and CRC operations and the Agency partieipation

In the activities and funding of the groups, a large number

Of JWAVE and Headquarters were directly Involved with both

IRD and CHC personnel.

tion concerning Hiss Juanita CASTRO.

2 There la no indiention of any Agency rolatlorship

wIth INCA prior to January 1963 when INCA sponsored H1g1

shortly after Miss CASTRO"s defection and there was

considerable interest in her appearance.

INCA was particularly

Interested since it had distributed hundreds of Engllah

and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when

she ms surfaced in Mexico. In October 1966 INCA again

requested that MIss CASTRO appoar as & guest sponker In

Jor American cities In connection with the release of

DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)

(STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1. The DRE was conceived, created and funded by the

Agency in September 1960 and terminated in December 1966.

It was an outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba

which fought against BATISTA and later against CASTRO.

Many of the leaders came into exile around September 1960

and were subsequently trained and infiltrated into Cuba

by the Agency in late 1960 where they operated by obtain

ing Intelligence setting up action teams, etc., up through

the Bay of Pigs invasion.

While the DRE was initially set

up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a

large amount of paramilitary aid in funds and material.

After the Bay of Pigs, the DRE engaged in independent

military actions which declined at Agency direction and

because of a reduction in funds from late 1962 unt11 ter

tee then

mination of the group. Members were used through 1966 as

political action agents, for publishing propaganda which

was sent throughout the Hemisphere, attending international

student meetings at Agency direction, and

producing radio

programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2.

After the cutback in military operations my

of the

best DRE members relocated in other areas.

present there are delegations in most Latin American coun-

tries which have maintained sone contact with various

Agency stations over the years although the DRE is no

longer very active. During the organization's 6 year

period of active existence DRE personnel were in contact

with several JWAVE staffers and outside contract agents.

However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contact

with DRE personnel was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel

SALVAT, the current DRE Secretary General who is now

operating a bookstore in Miami, Florida, and Fernando

GARCIA Chacon who was relocated in El Salvador.
