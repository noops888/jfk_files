- about whom

little was known or

discussed -- located at various places throughout the

country.

As an illustration, LICATAmentioned "our group"

in san Francisco and "our group"in San Jose, California.

He then identified the "Boss"

of the San Francisco group as

JAMES LANZA and the "Boss" of the San Jose group as JOE

CERRITO. LICATA also spoke of another such group as

"our

group"

in Texas. He did not elaborate further, but the

inference drawn by informant was that other such small

sroups were located elsewhere, and their existence was not

LICATA did not further identify such groups.

He did mention that DESIMONE had numerous expenses in connection

with these trips.

He also mentioned that DESIMONE had to go

out east

at least a half dozen times last year and after

such trips he had to relay instructions to certain other

contacts except to mention that DESIMONE had among other

LICATA then told informant in strict confidence --

requesting informant not to discuss this with any other

"member" of the

"Brugad"

-- that DESIMONE had to be in

New York on 1/25/65 to attend a meeting of the "Commissione"

LICATA did not state that he knew the purpose of

this meeting, but speculated.

that it possibly would relate

to the appointment of a new

by all the other

indicate, however, that after this meeting, "Bosses" to

be necessary for DESIMONE to contact other

For the information of the listed offices,

the late JACK DRAGNA (deceased

in 1956) as

Los Angeles "Brugad"

of La Cosa Nostra.

DESIMONE was an

attendee at the Apalachin Meeting in November, 1957.

For a number of months, DESIMONE has not resided

in the Los Angeles area and his whereabouts are known only to

whereabouts of DESIMONE or where they meet.

Recent investigation has determined that DESIMONE

is presently residing at 517 Tyron Street, El Cajon,

California.

This home and all utilities are listed

in the

name of an associate, PETE MONTANA. DESIMONE, has apparently

kept his residence here a well-guarded secret.

This

information has been handled in a most discreet manner

by the San Diego and Los Angeles Offices.
