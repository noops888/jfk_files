fined

In the U.S. by the Agency for

a period of approximately three years.

NOSENKO first contacted Agency per.

sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962

subsequently defected in santary

NOSINKO was brought to the l.5.

and after i period of rolative freedon.

he was involuntarily confined in

April 1964.

From April 1964 to

August 1965, he was confined it an

Agency controlled site in Clinton,

From August 1065 to

October 1967, NOSINKO wus confined

In October

196r, no was returned to the kashington

area, given increasing amounts of

freedom until he was given total free-

dom in April 1969.

NOSENKO became a

was. employed by the Agency. as a

consultant in March 1969 and continues

under contract to date.

His present

salary is $23,500 per ycar.

against his will was discussed by

Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others sith

1964 (Tab 1) .

On 3 April 1964, the

Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence

RESULTS

TERMINATION

COMMENTS

My memorandom dared 2 October 1908,

the bircutor of Security formarded

two reports to the DUct summarizing

the results of the NOSENdO case to

that date.

The reports are voluminous.

One was prepared by the Office of

scourity and the other hy the FBl.

Both reports conclude that NOSENKO

was a bona fide defector.

A draft

memorandum attached to this file,

dated 21 October 1968 and prepared

by the Cl Staff, raises question

regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and challenges the shove two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

thc: луспсу.

He is brought to Washington

periodically to consult on matters

germane to his background and experience.

Various reports are available in the

filos of the Offico of Socurity which

detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since

the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original

they do not

document the rationale

confinement of NOSENKO for his continued

confinement over so long a period of time.

A memorandum dated 5 August 1909 states

that various congressional staff officers

were briefed on NOSENKO and states that

concern for his safety, as well as con-

cern regarding his bona fides, prompted

the prolonged confinement.

(See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Sccurity files document

a period in 1969 during which a mail

cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip

to Florida.

During this trip, Agency personnel, with

apparent Headquarters approval, obtained

the services of prostitutes.

This

apparently occurred on at least two

occasions.

SUBJECT:

Discussion

with Depusy Actorney.

General on Nosento Case

Ms lelas,' Mr. Houston and Mr. Nurphy not wich

the Deputy Attornoy Conoral and seabers of his staff to

discuss subject case.

Present fron Mr. Katzonbach g.

staff were Messrs. Foley, Yeagley and Rais.

2. Mr. Holas explained cha liosento case briefly

and indicated that shortly ve rould be faced wich whoe

we at lease considored to be two problens on which ve

would like the advico

of the Deparcient of Juseice.

First, wo would seoon

fool coapelled to begin hostllo

interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive a? the cruch

with respect to hig mission for the KGB and ve wonderod

what the legal position would be in circuistances in

which we datained Nosenko against his will for this pur-

pose.

Second, we would have to be roady aftor detorain-

ing that we

could obtain no addisional inforantion fron

Nosenko to deport hiu.. Me had thought of caking bia to

Cormany and transferring him to Soviat custody in Borlin

where this has been done a nuber of times in the past.

3.

There was sono discussion of shetbor deportation

to mother country might be a consideration.

Nt. Helas

explained no would probably face publicity problems in

deporting

to & third country of the kind we would en-

counter'if ho were froo in the U. S. Mr. Helms noted

thore were many itons of inforsation which me and the

FBI realizo aro of no significance because of the filo

holdings-re have but wich an unscrupulous newspapor san

could use so creato nischief.

This aspect was then dropped

and it was the consensus that serlin was probably the best

place.

2223

4. The question of the basis for detention was again

raised and relacod by Mr. Foloy so the conjiciong under

which Nosenko is in this country. la is horo as an "ox-

which seans ho bas not been

sunitted and has boon paroled to che dzency which is

parolo can be interproted to moan parolo to a spocifle

locale which would provide sone justification for our

detaining hin for questioning.

It was then pointed out,

however, that if be said ho wished to leave the country

to raturn to the Soviet Union, tochnically we would not

be

ablo to detain hin further.

In this event, ve would

bo faced with the need so deport his quickly and quietly

and for this purpose tbe inmigration marrant of arrest

and deportation was probably the boss instruciont.

Ira Katzenbach ashod MI. Foley to chock Inte

Mr.. Holus thanked. Mr. latzenbach for his assistinco

about what we expected

so happon to him when he starrad to climb over that "vall"

MEMORANDUM FOR:

. Director of Security

SUBJECT:

Parole Status of Dofectora

1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department

of Justice or the status of aliens whose inspection by I& NS is deferred

upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to thie Agency.

Is was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible

for taking any action necessary to carry out the torms of the parole.

•Z. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the

Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. Altor setting up

conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:

"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agancy will assume

responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it

believes consistent with the internal jecurity neads oi the United States

during continuance of their parole starus." This means that the

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary

, to protect the internal security needs of the United. States. The word

"minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good

judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.

The agreement further provides that upon completion of the

parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or it

internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from

this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such

case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

portiong.

He is to have no dessert or "trimmings, "

eat properly. (CAUTION--Extreme care should be

exercised with regard to controlling the silverware,

...

and it was suggested that at least two of the guards.

be required to count the silverware in and out; that

the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner

where it could be observed before the guards enter

the room, etc.)

adequate air-conditioning equipment to insure that a

wish to explore some modifications in the assigament of personnel

or schedule of assignments. In addition, the Acting Chief, Support

Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to

devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an

emergency involving loss of control of the Subject. This should

be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors

and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed

as to their responsibilities in this matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Yuriy Svanovich NOSENKO

In early or mid-1967, the Agency General. Counsel was

provided a summary of the Nosenko case.

The negorandum

sought an advisory opinion from the General Counsel on the

Agency's legal basis for its handling of losenko through

that date and on the legal aspects on the eventual disposi-

tion of Nosenko. Shortly subsequent to this negorandum to

the General Counsel, Nosenko took

up residence in October 1967

in an apartment in the Washington area and was reminded that

should he wish, he could travel freely anywhere at anytime.

He gradually created

a new life for himself in the United

States and has indicated on several occasions that he holds

no ill feeling about his handling by the Agency at anytime.

Background

Nosenko voluntarily established contact with CIA repre-

sentatives in Geneva in 1962. He identified hinself as a

staff officer of the KGB's internal security directorate and

offered to sell counterintelligence information. This offer

was

accepted and he was recruited

debriofed on counterintelligence matters during five meetings

in Geneva. He then returned to the USSR. He came to Geneva

again in January 1964 as the security officer for the Soviet

disarmament delegation. After i number of mectings with his

CIA handlers he defected on 4 February 1964 and was secretly

taken to Frankfurt, Germany, crossing the Swiss-German border

on the night of 1/5 February with

alias U.S. Army identity

documents. In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,

Nosenko wrote out®

an asylum request, requesting political

asylum

from the U.S. Government.

Because serious doubts about Nosenko's bona fides had

arisen on the basis of the information he had provided both

in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-

inally planned to do a detailed bona fides debriefing and

assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving

Nosenko

to the United States. However, unprecedented action

by the Soviet. Government in respect to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the

press that

Nosenko, described as an "expert attached to the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected.

SECRET

## Page 50

SECRET

Because of mounting

pressure from

the press, which included

much speculation that Nosenko was a

high level scientist or

disarmament expert, it was decided

that the State Department

would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's

request for asylum in the U.S. and identifying him'as a

member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February. On 11 Feb-

ruary, the Sovict Government delivered a note to the American

Embassy in Moscow

asking how Nosenko left Switzerland and

requesting an immediate interview with him

and his

relcase.

On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-

ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he

accused the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in

locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected

these charges, the American Ambassador to Switzerland recom-

mended that swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko

to convince thenselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of

his own free will.

On 12 February

1964, on the instructions of the Director,

Nosenko was brought to the United States.

He travelled by

commercial air, again using alias

and was admitted to the country..at New York City (in true

name) on parole under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (5)

of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

On the evening of 14 february, the U.S. State Department made

Nosenio's bona fides had not yet been established. It was

uating the significance of Nosenko's information as it affects

the security interests of the State Department.

Because so much of Nosenko's information affected u.s.

internal security matters for which the FBI bears primary

responsibility, and because the possibility that Nosenko was

a KGB plant had a direct bearing

the validity of cortain

FBI operations, the FBI was kept fully informed on our views

about Nosenko's bona fides and our progress in interrogating

and investigating him from

the moment of his defection.. The

FBI liaison officer was

told of our reservations on losenko's

bona fides as

carly as 5 February 1964. The Director öf the

FBI and his deputy for Internal

Security, Millian Sullivan,

possible that

(and several members of his

ervations

about Nosenko on 2

to have the time to analye and resolve this case, and to

plan and execute appropriate countermeasures, it was essential

that we attempt to keep the NGB fron learning of our awareness

of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and

the implications thereof, was restricted tu a very few people

in the Agency and the intelligence community. Nonetheless,

we did advise

key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-

ligence community, even though this carried the incritable

risk of leakage.

Soviet Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the Soviets

were making a serious effort

to find out what happened to

Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant

and unusual of these was the approach by a Soviet journalist,

Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the Frerch

magazine

Paris Match with an offer

8o provide photographs and materials

for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family, According

to Korolev, Nosenko's wifo was

considering an approach

to an

international juridicial

orgahization

in an effort to obtain

compensation from Nosenko

for damages caused by his abandon-

ment of her

and her children.

In responding to this approach

se quoted a statement, purporting to be fron Nosenko himself,

these

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach

to repre.

sent blatant and cruel manipulation of his family by the KGB.

and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing

to an interview or in any other way.

Nosenko's Status

To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions

of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality

Act.. Parole responsibility is delegated to the Agency by

the Attorney General under the terms of an agreement executed

by the Attorney General and the ECl on 10 February 1955,

which states:

"After

parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-

ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

care, supervison and control of a kind and

degree it believes consistent with the internal

security needs of the United

States during con-

tinuance of their parole status."

In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and

because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious

and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we.

ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

12

States. From

12 February to a April 1004 it was possible to

keep

Nosenio at a location where he could enjoy a certain

amount of novement and of

contact with the outside world.

After & April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was

necessary to keep him incommunicado at a location which is

known to no one outside of the agency land to very fow within

it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country

undor the Special Agreement Procedures was periodically

extended bo the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Although his freedon of movement had been severely

restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and he made no com-

plaint about his treatment. On the contrary, we had soveral

written statements from him in which he stated that our

handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal

From the time that Nosenko was brought to this country

we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation

as a contingency measure. In carly 1964, we thought that it

might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda

drawbacks of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenko

has confessed his true KGB role.

With the passage of tame,

however, and in view of

our much firmer

conclusions about his

real role and mission

and our clearer understanding of what

13

SECRET

---

## Page 61

SECRET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems

stood in

the way of his deportation

to either the USSR or a

third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous

occasions

that he will never contemplate return

to the USSR,

and, although we suspect that he might secretly

welcome such

is move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end

with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,

etc. When the possibility of expulsion was discussed with

Departnent of State officials in 1964, both tho Secretary of

State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for

the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-

tors.

Forcible repatriation of political refugees is against

long established U.S. policy, and would be cortain to arouse

violent reaction

from

ethnic minority groups in the United

States.

Under these circumstances an alleged "confession"

by Nosenko would have come under very close scrutiny, and

might have backfired very

badly. Another point that had to

be considered was the possibility that the Soviets, again

playing their part, might have refused

to accupe Nosenko on

the grounds that he has renounced his Sovict citizenship.

Third country: Although we believed it likely that

Nosenko would accede to deportation to a third country.

14

there

is certainly no country in the free world on which we

could

conceivably have unloaded Nosenko without first inform-

ing them of his true status.

Even if we considered this a

desirable objective, it seemed certain that the Department

of State would veto such à piece of intergovernmental duplic-

Ty on the basis of the-politient risks involved t

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel

SUBJECT

: Office of Security reports on PARAGON,

NOSENKO, AELADLE, CELOTEX I and Il

and MOCKINGBIRD

n0n.

Forwarded herewith is a 3l December 1971 memorandum

from the Arting. Director of Security on subject activities. The

material represents responses to questions posed by your office.

Obviously, the next phase of the investigation will require more

detailed reviews of each activity.

2. Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON

We should

spell out what is meant by the

statement that the FBI "deferred further coveragé

to the Office of Security, " how it was expressed and

what form it took.

The taping of two conversations does not seem

to constitute "'electronic surveillance" in the usual

sense. It certainly is not trespatory surveillance.

A little more detail on the equipment will be wanted.

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI

knowledge, and report such information as we ger.

AELADLE

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry.

P2.93000

## Page 68

CELOTEX !

We will want more detail on the actual

surveillance, including possible higher approval.

This is responsive to the DCI's request for

newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

CELOTEX II

Questions similar to CELOTEX I.

"We may want actual copies of newspaper

stories for display, in addition to memos,

should

DCI wish to use it..

- MOCKING BIRD:

No recorded (in CIA) formal approval by

Attorney General. It may be that Justice will

1.

Reference

is made to Mr.

Ainslie's vorbal request

for a

revicw of Office of Security files in

effort to

provide information pertinent to a case mentioned

on page

170 of the Report to the President by the Commission on CIA

activitics within the United States.

The case in question

from page 170 of the Commission

is quoted as

"In one other case, a defector

was physically abüsed, although not seriously injured.

Director-of-Contral=Intolligencerdischarged the-employee in

volved.

3.

A search of Office of Security file resources has

roflected information pertinent to i

case in which a defector

was-physically- abused-at an overscas location, and the Agency

employee was later. terminated by the bet.

It is not known

whether the following case is identical to the referenced

case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts

appear to be quite similar.

Information developed by this Office of possible in-

terest to the Inspector General, pertains to one

John Torpats,

an ex-CIA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

5.

• Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a

naturalized U.S. citizen

in 1926.

Torpats was employed by

CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961. • The

ile information reflected that in July 1956

Torpats was found

in Frankfurt, West Germany.

The alien involved was Eduard

an Estonian who defected

from Estonia through Sweden

The incident in Frankfurt involved sistreatment of

Oun during interrogations directed by Torpats.

ine charges

of physical abuse included the striking of bun with the fist:

application of turpentine and ointments to various parts of

the body he sening on be set brush. and f

and forca

interrogations with only very brief rest periods.

7.

Torpats was returned to leadyuarters and was brought

beforc

an Employment Review Board for consideration of separa-

tion from

the Agency

the Board's recommendation's

were that Torpats be "transferred to an area outside

the

Clandestine Services."

Torpats appealed the decision,

and a

later recommendation included reduction in grade from GS-14

to GS-13.

Torpats later reccived unsatisfactory fitness re-

ports

and engoged in various "in house" battles with Agency

officials concerning his employment.

8.

Torpats was later terminated in accordince with the

authority granted the DCI under Section 102(C) of the National

Sccurity Act of 1947, as ammended, effective 30 January 1961.

Later in 10 torpats liled suit-against -the-Delscontestingf

his dismissal and the-U.S. Distriot Court for the District of

"columbia granted the government's motion for summary judgment

against Torpats. Torpats appealed the decision,

and the U.s.

Court of Appeals, in 1962, upheld the lower court's ruling

that Torpats!

- termination was.legal.....

9. The Office of Security file of Eduard Oun contained

little

information other than

interrogation reports dated 1956.

It was

not clear from

file information whether Oun entered the

United

States after the Frankfurt incident.

The most recent

document contained in the Oun file was dated 17 September

1956 and noted that Oun had been psychiatrically examined and

found

qualified

for Agency sponsored immigration to the u.s.

under Public Law 203..

Nott:

Nosenko was aried why he was chosen to so to Gieneve in 1962

1ndad of an didicer from the Department (KCH) Delegation.

Ammering this question lie mentioned thie recrustment of ten

Americans

decidud you go,

that 1 must be hero (in Genevi). I sald, "Be my

docided "You will go. That's all" (Nosenko knocked on the desk). ..

Well, what am 1?...... Who Who have I recruitted?.. • Ten Americans,

III. Sovict vinas and other regulations for tourists traveling to the USSR

1. 1. Didn't you know or remember how Oswald's visa was processed and

from what country Oswald entered the USSR? Is it porsible that he

entered the USSR on a "podvisnaya" visa?

V2. You previoualy said that you saw Oswald's visa application, but you could

not say from what country Oswald came to the USSR.

In your opinion, is

It possible that Oswald received his visa application in some other European

country, then went to Finland and through Finland entered the USSR without

contacting the Sovier consulate in Helsinki? Did you hear any talk about the

possibility that is described above? Il su, when did you hear it and from

whom?

3. On 3 July 1961 you staied that you have seen Oswald's anketa (visa

application). Do you remember what was in that anketa? Did you read

the anketa? What did you mean that you saw the anketa? Was it in the

nane Lee Harvey Oswald, or was there another name? Did you see the

name of the person uto signed the anketa?

Ao lore your disor any information des the effred thear Ossold might not have

come: 10 the 50al conoulate or to the Soviet Enharay in Helsinki lo

slain his visio! Could he hive ghtined is vine in Switserlaud.ur. Sweden

lins nave corne to deisinti and, without reporting do the soviet conculate

is Helsinki, hase lilien a train do leningrad and then lo Moscuw?.

I So becording to your previous inforsnation, "iny tourist - he luys a lour

t0 the Soviel Union, makes out the ankrlie, and the comes lo Moscow."

- In shat country die Onwale buy a tour to the USSR? In what country did

Oswald fill in the ankota? If the ankela ques lo Moscow, lo what offico

in Moscow does it go? To MID, KGI? Is it possiblo that all the data on

Oswald from his ankcia was sent to Moscow by a cable? Did you see and

read Oswald's ankets or a telegrarn that Oswald la coming to Moscow?

If you did not read the anketa, who among the KCiB officers of the Second

Chief Directorate or the First Chief Directorate send the anketa or had

access to it? Who would logically have access lo tho anketa?

vl. Necording to your previous information, any person who wants to visit the

USSR has to buy a tour in a foreign touriat firm in his home country or any

other country, and the tourist firm will make arrangements for his stay in

the USSR. It is understood that he must fill in tho ankota, and in addition to

the general questions, the common tourist ghould mako requests for the

cities he intends to visit and for the accommodations he wants. The tourist

would know in advance when he receives his visa his date of arrival in

Moscow; in what hotel he is going to stay, and what kind of accommodations

he would be given. The question, then, is do you know when Intourist

received Oswald's request and application and when it answered hini that

his derands are met and that he is welcome in Moscow?

IT. From your knowledge, when Oswald arrived in Moscow, was he handled by

the Intourist Agency or by Sputnik, the Youth Tourist Bureau of the USSR,.

or by the Central Council for Tourism of the Soviet Trade Unions?

Note:

The Central Council for Touriem of the Suwet Trade Unions organizes

exchanges of tourists between trade unions of the USSR and other

countries. Sputnik was organized in June 1958 for the exchange of.

of tourists (students and other youths).

Whee wine thre

application to the Soviet Embassy?

J9. You stated previously that Oswald with not condidered a defector. If he

was not a defector, then what was he?

Note:

If the KGB die nut consider Oswald to be a defector, then it is

possible that Oswald was known to the KGB long before his arrival

in the USSK as i tourigt and Oswald was assured that when he

arrived in the USSR he would be given Soviet citizenship or at

least a permanent residence permil. Although he would be a defector

anyway, it could be that Oswald did not like the word defector

and the Y.GB decided not to call him à defector but, let us say, a

volunteer.

The Soviet Constitution states that the USSR grants the

right of anylum to all foreign citizens "uto are persecuted for

salcguarding the interests of the working class or who are persecuted

for scientific activitieg, for national-liberation struggle. " (Article

129 of the USSR Constitution of 1936.)

1 10. You staled previously that "since about 1960, every Sovict ambassador

- can give a visa in threo to five days.

It so, what was so special for the

Soviet government that the ambassador would be personally involved in

issuing a visa to Oswald?

"It is known that in 1957 the Soviet government adopted some measures

to improve travel for foroign tourists in the USSR.

They mostly

concerned currency eschange.

The 1957 regulations said nothing

about visas, Nosenko should be questioned about the 1957 decision

of the Soviet government to determine if he is not mistaking the 1957

decision with that of 1960.

11. You stated previously that since about 1960, every Soviet ambassador

can give vigas in from throe to five days. The available information

published by the Soviets unmistakenly states that a visa cannot be obtained

in less than seven days (in some cases it takes five to seven days). Following

are excerpts from a book entitled Moscow, A Tourists Companion, published. M

in Moscow in 1963, and from the magazine Soviet Life, May 1978, p. 59.

Soviet Life stated that "visas are issued within 10 days of receipt of

application at a Soviet consulate. "

2o. What do you know about Alcksandr Nikiforovich Aksenev?

Note:

(a) Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of the KGB of Belorussia

from 1959 to 1960. It is assumed that when Oswald arrived

in Minsk in January 1960, Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of

of the KGB and would definitely know about the Oswald case.

From 1960 to 1965, Aksenov was MVD Minister of Belorussia.

Therefore it would be under his direction that Oswald's passport

and the departure of Oswald and Marina from Minsk was

arranged. If Nosenko had access to Oswald's file, he must

know about Aksenov. From 1965 to 1971, Aksenov was First

Secretary of the Vitchsk Obkom of CP Belorussia, and since

1971, Aksenov has been Second Secretary of the Central

Committee of the Belorussian CP. He has been a member of

the CC CPSU since 1976, and he is also a deputy to the USSR

Supreme Soviet. On May 9, 1978, Aksenov arrived in Columbia

He headed the Soviet delegation on the invitation of the Columbian

Communist Party.

Marina Orwald had an interview in 1961.

Akseav In also

mentioned in McMillan's book (pages 138-133). Alsehov

illegarily said to Mirinia:

"Tell your husband not to worry.. I

believe your request willr granted." Also see piage 125 of

the same book.

13. Dirl you linow or know of Arkadiy Denisovich Rudak?

Note: Budak wag Deputy Chairman of the KGB during 1959 to 1760 and

might have taken part in the Oswald case whilc. Orwald lived

in Minsk.

1.. Did you know or know of Major General Stepan Alekseyevich Smorodinskiy?

Note:

Smorodingkiy was Deputy Chairman of the KGI for Belorussia in

1962 and most likely know about the Oswald case.

His name

would most likely appear in the Oswald file.

J. 5.. Do you know It. General Vasilly Ivanovich Petrov?

Note: Petrov was KGB Chairman for Belorussia from 1959 to 1973.

Thereforc, it would be his agency, the KGB, which would watch

Oswald in Minsk. It is safe to assume that after the assassination

of President Kennedy in 1963, Petrov, ao Chairman of the KGB

of Belorussia, would review the Oswald file and send it to Moscow.

He would also have been called to Moscow KGB headquarters to

take part in the preparation of the spravka (summary) of the

Oswald file.

,. What do you know about Lit. General Aleksandr Ivanovich Perepelitayn?

Note: Perepelitayn was Chairman of the KGB of the Belorugsian Republic

from 1954 to 1959.

Nosenko should know him or at least about him.

Nosenko should be asked if Perepelitsyn took any part in the

investigation of Oswald. (Perepelitsyn was Deputy Chairman of

the KGB of the USSR from 1959 to 1967. He died in Moscow.)

v%. What part, if any, was played by General Sergey Grigoryevich Bannikov

in the Oswald casc, especially after the assassination of President Kennedy?.

Note:

Bannikov was mentioned by Nosenko as one of the Deputy Chiefs of

the Second Chief Directorate and later on as one of the Deputy

Chairmen of the KGB of the USSR,

From 1968 to 1978, Bannikov

was Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Supreme Court.

V. Nosenko - Nikolayev

~ I. Can you explain why you went to England and Cuba under the name Nikolayev

and to Geneva using your true name, Nosenko? What would have happened

if some Englishman or English intelligence officer had met you in Geneva

in 1962 or in 1964 and grecied you in the presence of the other delegates

with the words, "Oh, dr. Nihologes! How are you?

remember you.

You visited England with the team of loxers."

a 1. From where did you lourn that the fill was not informed shout Oswald's

presencr. in the USSR? Wouldn't the GRU officer in Intourist, whom you

mentioned carlier, have known about Oswald's presence in the USSR?

Did you ever hear that Oswald possibly had contact with the Soviet

intelligence during his service

in Japan?

Z.. You stated previously that there was no information that Oswald offered

to give information on the US Marine Corps. You did not read the file.

Then how do you know this to be the case? How do you know that the KGB

and GRU made no attempt to debrief Oswald about his service in the

US Marine Corps?

/ 3. Previously you mentioned one Colonel Voloshin as an officer of the

Dofense Ministry of the USSR. Can you provide any additional information

on this Voloshin? Could it be possible that he was a KGB officer instcad

of in the Defense Ministry?

Note: (a) Accoïding to Epstein's book, one Pavel T. Voloshin was an

administrator at Patrice Lumumba University and was a KGB

officer who accompanied a group of Russian dancers to Los Angeles

in 1959 at just about the same time that Oswald was making

weckend trips there to get his passport and possibly to make other

arrangements for his trip to Moscow. A few weeks after Oswald

decided to return to the United States, he received a letter from

Patrice Lumumba University Signed by Voloshin. (page 111)

(b) P. D. knew one KGB officer by the name of Voloshin (first

and middle name forgotten) who used to work in SMERSH

(military CI) and later in the late 1940's and beginning of the

1950's in S & T Department of the KGB.

VIL. Marina.

i. I. From where did you pick up the information that Marina was a "simple.

óbyvatel" (a politically unaware person) and that she was not anti-Soviet

if you did not rear the Oswald file?

16

## Page 114

Lo You stated previously that Marina was an Obstatel: Do you here any

comments on the following: "We knew each time you had i date.

We

knew when you applied for youg marriage licends..

We knew the date of

your worlding." These were the words of the loomol recretry in

Mingl: when Marina was expolled from the Komsomol.

i3. Do you have any comments on Marina's statement when she said,

"Our governinent (Soviet) knows every move I makc." She make this

comment shortly after her expulsion from the Kunisomol.

• 4. Did you know that while in Minsk Marina belonged to a group of youths

who gathered together to listen to Voice of America and BBC? Would

that be enough for the KGB to have Marina in its card files? Is it

possible that Marina was the KGB agent reporting on them?

~ S. You stated that if Marina had been recruited by the KGB, you would

know about it and it would be in the file.

But you did not rend the file.

How then do you know that she was not recruited?

v 6. You said that among Marina's relatives there was an officer of tho Minsk

Militia, a Lt. Colonel. Do you have any comments on Marina's

revelation that her real father was a traitor and that he was shot? If

her father was a traitor and he was shot, would his name be in the KGB

card file? Would the name of Marina's mother be in the KGB card file

as the wife of a traitor? Is it then possible that Marina's name also

would be in the KGB card file somewhere?

• 7. You stated previously that KGB had no interest in Marina prior to her

meeting Oswald and that the KGB investigated her only after Oswald

applied for permission to register marriage with Marina. How do you

know that? Did you read a special file on Marina? Marina revealed

lately that while she was living in Leningrad in 1958 or 1959, she met

a diplomat from Afghanistan who lured her to his hotel room and tried

to make love to her.. Do you think the KGB in Leningrad would know

about this diplomat and whom he lured to his hotel? Is it possible that

• 8. You stilled previouly that you saw Ossald's file only briefly and you

read only a summary. Then how would you know that Marina wins novor

used by. the KGD? Did you personally make a direct check on whother or.

not Marina Was a KCB informante

• % In your previous testimony, you categorically denied that Marina was a

KGB-MVD agent or informer. Do you have any comments on Marina's

statement to Lifo Magazino that she was a "Soviet agent"? Is there any

possibility that the KGB or MVD in Belorussia or in Leningrad, whore

Marina had lived previously, had recruitted her as an agent or informer

and she continued to work for the KGB or the MVD until her departuro to

the US? Did you have any information about the possibility that there was

another file in the KGB on Marina, a file for an agent or informer of the

KGB or MVD? If such a file existed, it must be reflected in the Oswald

file, as well as in the surnmary which you read.

~ 10. Did you hear or know that while in Leningrad Marina dated one Oleg

Tarussin, a student who had ambitions to enter the Soviet diplomatic

service and who had some trouble with the authorities over a minor

political incident?

11. Was there any information in Oswald's file to show that after Oswald

married Marina, Marina was in the hospital for about five days?

v.. 12. What do you know about Marina's vacation in Kharkov shortly alter

she married Oswald?

Note: She may have been in Moscow instead of Kharkov.

• 13. Did you know that while in Minsk Oswald was in the Fourth Clinical

Hospital for surgery on his adenoids? (Oswald go: special attention from

the doctors.)

Note: Marina's Aunt Valya, whose husband was an MVD Colonel, sent

eggs to Oswald while he was in the hospital.

V 4. Are you sure that there was no file on Oswald in the KGB before he

arrived in the USSR? How do you know this? Did you personally check it?

¡ 5. You previously told American authorities that on the cover of Oswald's

file "there definitely was a 'klichka'. " But you said you did not remember

the klichka. Do you remember

whether the klichka was one word or two. As you did not read the file,

is it possible that it was an old file, opened a few years previously by

the First Chief Directorate or by the GRU?

abnormal without medical expertise.

the Ministry of Foreign Alfairs, not Inform the Arnerican Embassy about

it?

Note: In his provious interrogation, Nosenko hesitated in answering those

questions.

~ 20. You stated previouely that Oswald was in the hospital, the hoapital said

that Oswald was not normal, and there was no action taken to inform the

American Embassy. How do you know all of this without reading the

any comments on the fict that alter his arrival in the USSK, and altor

having made oral requeals for Sovict citizenship, he returned to the

Do you think the KCB monitored Oswald'e conversations with the

American Consulate officers or received reporte from the American

Embassy (from Soviet employces there or Soviet agents there) about

Oswald's denunciation of US citizenship? Did the KGB instruct Oswald

to denounce hle American citizenship at the American Embassy before

ho would be permitted to apply for Soviet citizenship?

26. You stated that the decision to give Oswald a stipend was mado by the

Red Cross.. Explain in detail how the Red Cross learned that Oswald

arrived in the USSR. Who informed the Red Cross that there was an

American who needed help? Why was it decided to give halp from the

Red Cross and not from the Trade Unlon? It is understandable that

Oswald might not have had enough money to start a new life in the USSR,

but he was not a poor beggar who needed to be turned to the Red Cross

instoad of the Trade Union. How did you find out that it was the Red Cross

that made the decision? According to available information, the Red

Cross does not assign money to anybody without the recommendation of

some other Soviet office. Which office was it; the KGB, MVD, the

Council of Ministers, Intourist, or the USSR Supreme Soviet? Who

Marina?

V'28. You stated previously that Oswald's file was sent to the Second Directorale

of the Belorussian KGB. Hen do you know that it was sent specifically

to the Second Directorate and not to the KGB chairman or hie deputy

with a special instruction?

his American citizenship but had become a citizen uf the USSR. "

Note:

In important cases the real file is in the place where the subject

lives and works.

In this case, the Oswald file was in Minsk.

Moscow would have an almost identical file on the subject for

MEMORANDUM FOR: :

. Director of Security

SUBJECT:

Parole Status of Dofectora

1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Dapartment.

of Justice on the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is defarred

upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this agency.

It was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible

for taking any action necessary to carsy out the torms of the parole.

2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the

Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. Altor setting up

conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:

"Aftes parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligenco Agency will assume

responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it

believes consistent with the internal Jecurity needs of the United Srateo

during continuance of their parole status. " This means that the

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary

, to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word

"minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good

judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.

3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the

parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if

internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from

this country through arrangements made by she Agency and, in such

case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

departure.

but may have the necessary silverware with which to

eat properly. (CAUTION»-Extreme care should be

exercised with regard to controlling the silverware,

be required to count the silverware in and out; that

the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner

where it could be observed before the guards enter

the room, etc.)

(2)

Arraugements are to be made for the installation of

adequate air-conditioning equipment to insure that a

wish to explore some modifications in the assignment of personnel

or schedule of assignments. In addition, the Acting Chief, Support

Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to

devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an

emergency involving loss of control of the Subject This should

be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors

and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed

as to their responsibilities in this matter.

Question

#3 - Did McCone of Raborn have iny information

on this:

What?

Answer:

Office of Security records contain only limited information

in regard to this question.

The St Division

(then SR) was the

responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until latc

October 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the

Office of Security by the DCI.

It is prosumed that the DCI was

at lcust generally aware of the confinement of Nosenko and the

conditions of confinement, but any delinite statement must be

based on SE records.

Question 11 - Where is Nosenko working now?

Answer:

Nosenko is currently emplojed at his personally owned

residence

_ Ile is engaged in research and

analytical work based on his previous knowlcdge of the KGB

and other Soviet matters.

He is in the Washington, D. C. arca

for several days approximately evory six wocks for direct

interviews by the FBl.and Office of

Security personnel.

Question 15 - Is he working for CIA?

Answer:

Nosenko has been employed by the Agency on a full-time

contractual basis since 1 March 1969.

The original contract

has been periodically amended to rellect adultional remuneration,

primarily

to compensate for cost of living increases. In late

1974, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agrecment for salary

not reccived during the 1 April 1964 to l March 1969.

In addition,

on 12 July 1975 Nosenko signed an acknowledgement and release

of the United States Government and the Central Intelligence

Agency from

any claims

prior to

that date.

Question 16 - What is his legal status?

Answer:

Nosenko was naturalized as a United States citizen

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Yuriy avanovich NOSENKO

In early or mid-1967, the Agency General Counsel was

provided a summary of the Nosenko case.

The negorandum

sought

an advisory opinion from the General Counsel on the

Agency's legal basis for its handling of liosenko through

that date and on the logal aspects on the eventual dispost-

tion of Nosenko. Shortly subsequent to this senorandum to

the General Counsel, Nosenko took up residence in October 1967

in an apartment in the Washington area and was reminded that

should he wish, he could travel freely anywhere at anytime.

He gradually created a now life for himself in the United

States and has indicated on several occasions that he holds

307.9

no ill feeling about his handling by the Agency at anytime.

Background

Nosenko voluntarily established contact with ClA repre-.

sentatives in Genevi in 1962. He identified hisself as a

staff officer of the KGB's internal security directorate and

offered

to

sell counterintelligence information. This offer

was accepted and he was recruited as an agent in place and

debriefed on counterintelligence matters during five meetings

in Geneva. He then returned to the USSR. He came to Geneva

---

again in January 1964 as the security officer for

the

Soviet

disarmament delegation. Niter a number of mectings with his

CIA handlers he defected on 4 February 1967 and was secretly

taken to Frankfurt, Germany, crossing the Swiss-German border.-

on the night of 1/5 February with alias U.S. Army identity

documents.

In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,

Nosenko wrote out

an asylum request, requesting political

asylum from the U.S. Government.

Because serious doubts about Nosenio's bona fides had

arison on the basis of the information he had provided both

in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-

inally planned to do a detailed bona fides dobriefing and

assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving.

Nosenko to the United States. However, unpreccuented action

by the Soviet Government in respect to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the

press that Nosenko, described as an "expert attached to the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected.

2

SECRET

## Page 174

SECRET

Because of mounting pressure from the press, which included

much speculation that Nosenko was a high

level scientist or

disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department

would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko stand

request for asylum in the U.S. and identifying him as a

member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February. On 11 Feb-

ruary, the Soviet Government delivered a note to the Amcrican

Embassy in Moscow

isking how

Nosenko left

Switzerland and

requesting an

immediate intervicw with him and his

relcase.

On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-

ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva

in which he

accused the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in

locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected

these charges, the Amcrican Ambassador to Switzerland recom-

mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko..

to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of

his own free will.

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,

Nosenko was brought to the United States.

He travelled by

commercial air, again using alias

dentification,

and was admitted to the country. at New York City (in true

name) on parole under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (5)

of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

On 13 Fchruary, representatives

of the Swiss and Sovict

Embassies in Washington advised the State Department that

they desired

interviens with dosenko. On 14. February, in

Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO called in Ambassador

KOHLER and protestéd "impermissable activities" on the part

of the U.S. in Nosenko's case. Soviet press spokesmen took

an even harder line to lestern correspondents, and accused

the U.S. of kidnapping Nosenko. On the afternoon of 14 Sep-

tember, at two separate interviers, he spoke first to Swiss

Embassy and then

to Soviet Enbassy representatives.. At

these intervicws, which were also attended by State Department

and INS officials, Nosenko confirmed that he left Switzerland

of his own

free will to seek asylum in the U.S. In addition,

he replied

to questions of the Soviet Embassy representative

to the effect that he was renouncing his Soviet.citisenship.

On the evening of 14 February, the.U.S. State Department made

a brief formal reply to the soviet

protest, then

issued a

brief statement to the press noting that the interviews had

been held and that Nosenko had confirmed his desire

to remain

in this country.

cors and socurity guards. Evidence continued to mount that

he was is KGB plant, and it the

same time it became obvious

that it would be impossible to proccod further to resolve

the many suspicious points and contradictions that had arisen

without changing the conditions in which he was being held.

Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially

when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed

for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the issuance

of an alien registration card. At the same time, vosenko's

heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were causing

increasing difficulties to the security personnel charger ee

keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in

accordance with Agency local responsibility. It was clear

that it was only a matter of time before he created a public.

scandal.. More importantly, he was in a position to communi-

cate with the KGB since physical control could

nut

be absolute.

On 4 April 1964, Nosenio voluntarily underwent a polygraph

examination. The results of this examination indicated deception

on il number of critical points indicating that he wis sent

Dy the KGB to porform one or more missions which also involved

his penetration of the Agency and its operations. It was

sccided, thererore, that the physical circunstances or Nosenkors

stay in this country would have to be drastically changed if

the drency were to carry out

its counterintelligence responsi-

bilities ind adhere to the torms of the parole agreement. As

a result, he was

moved to quarters where his movements could

be more casily controlled, and his outing privileges vere

suspended pending resolution of bona fides.

It is worth noting that had we not taken the above action

nue accopted Nosento at face value, it is quite possible thae

we sould have proceeded with a series of operational actions

on the basis of his information. The results of some of these

actions could have been very embarrassing to the U.S. Governient

politically and damaging to U.S. national security. for exam-

ple, his chief operational proposal it the time, and one that

he was most insistent

that we should proceed

with immediately,

involved the compromise of a very

senior Soviet official.

in interrogations of Nosenko (in which he willingly cooperated)

investigations. We concluded that it had been established

beyond reusonable doubt that Nosenko was a NiB agent who

established contact with CIA, subsequently defected on NGB

instructions, and that he came to the United States on a

deception mission. The implications of this mission had a

grave and direct

bearing on U.S, national security. Although

our findings were supported by the results of two polygraph

examinations, the nature of the evidence was inadmissable in

a court of law. In any case, it is clear that Nosenko had

not been in a position to perform any overt act of transgres-

sion of U.S. espionage laws since 4 April 1901 when he was.

placed in a restricted area and deprived of any conceivahle

means of communication with the KGB.

Nosenko did not admit that he defected on NGB orders

or that he came to the U.S. on a KGe mission.. He has admitted,:

however, that he made numerous lies about his personal history

and about the details of his KGB service to U.S. officials,

both before and after arriving in the United States."

Secretary of State, the Ariorney Genoral, the Special Assis-

USIB members on 11 and 19 Ichruary 1964, which stated that

Nosenio's bond fides had not yet been established. It wils

agreed that no DS number would he issued to josenko, and that

he would be handled on a special basis by this Agency. In

internal

responsibility, and because the possibility that Nosenko was

a KGB plant had a direct bearing on the validity of certain

F3l operations, the FBI was kept fully informed on our viers

in interrogating

and investigating him from

the moment of his defection.

to have the time to analyze and resolve this case, and to

plan and execute appropriate countermensures, it vas essential

that he attempt to keep the doB fron learning of our awareness

of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of the depth and scope of our

suspicions about Nosento, and

the implications thereof, has restricted tu a very few people

in the Agency and the intelligence community. Nonetheless,

we did advise key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-

• ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

risk of Icakage.

Sovier Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the Soviets

were making a serious effort

to find out what happened to

Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant

and unusual of these was the

approach by a Soviet journalist,

Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the Frerch magazine

Paris Match with an offer to provide photographs and

matcrials

for an exclusive story of losenko and his family, decording

to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering an approach to an

international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain

compensation fron Nosenko for damages caused by his abandon-

ment of her and her children..

In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be from josenko himself,

"*.

## Page 183

SECRET

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach to repre-

sent blatant and cruel manipulation

of his fanily by the KGB

and that he will not lend himself to

the schene by agreeing

to an interview or in any other way.

Nosenko's Status

To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12. February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions

of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality

Act.

Parole responsibility is delcgated to the Agency by

the Attorney Gencral under the terms of an agreement executed

by the Attorney General and the Eil on 10 February 1955,

which

states:

"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-

ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

care, supervison

and control of a kind and

degree it believes consistent with the internal

security needs of the United

States during con-

tinuance of their parole status."

In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and

because we had reason to believe that josenko was a conscious

and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we

ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

12

## Page 184

SECRET

States. From 12 February to & April 1964 it was possible to

keep dosenio it a location where he could enjoy a certain

amount of movement and of contact with the outside world.

After 1 April 1904, for reasons explained above, it was

necessary to keep him incommunicado at a location which is

known to no one outside of the dyency land to very few within

it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country

under the Special Agreement Procedures was periodically

extended bo the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Although his frcedon of movement had been severely

restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and he made no com-

plaine about his treatment. On the contrary, we had several

written statements from him

in which he stated that our

handling of him

was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal

From

the time that Nosenko was brought to this country

we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation

as a contingency measure.

In carly 1964, we thought that it a

might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda

drawbachs of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosento

has confessed his true KGB role. With the passage of time,

however, and in vich of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission and our clearer understanding of what

13

SECRET

---

## Page 185

14-00000

SECRET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems

stood in the way of his deportation to either the USSR or a

third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous : . '

occasions that he will never contemplate return to the USSR,

and, although we suspect that he might secretly welcome such

is move, we would expect him

to ict out his part to the end

with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,

etc.

When the possibility of expulsion was discussed with

Departnent of State officials in 1964, both the Secretary of

State and Anbassador Thompson expressed their concern for

the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-

tors. Forcible repatriation of political rufugees is against

long established U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse

violent reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United

States.

Under these circumstances an alleged "confession"

by losenko would have come under very close scrutiny, and

might have backfired very badly. Another point that had to

be considered was

the possibility that the Soviets, again

playing their

part, might have refused

to accept Nosenko on

the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.

Third Country: Although we believed it likely that

Yosenko would accode to deportation to a third country,

14

SECRET

---

## Page 186

SEGRET

there is certainly no country in the free world on which we

could conceivably have unloaded Nosento without

first inform-

ing them of his true status.

Even if we considered this a

desirable objective, it seemed certain that the Department

of State would veto such a piece of intergovernmentil duplic-

it! on che basis of the political rists involved.

NOSENKO, AELADLE, CELOTEX I and I

and MOCKINGBIRD

1. Forwarded herewith is a 31 December 1974 memorandum

from the Acting Director of Security on subject activities. The

material represents responses lo questions posed by your office.

Obviously, the next phase of the investigation will require more

detailed reviews of each activity.

2. Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON

We should spell out what is meant by the

statement that the FBI "deferred further coveragé

to the Office of Security," how it was expressed and

what form it took.

The taping of two conversations does not seem

to constitute "electronic surveillance" in the usual

ense. It certainly is not trespatory surveillance

A little more detail on the equipment will be wanted

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI

knowledge, and report such information as we gei.

AFLADLE

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry.

-5999

## Page 192

• CELOTEX I

We will want more detail on the actual

surveillance, including possible higher approval.

This is responsive to the DCI's request for

newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

CELOTEX II

Questions similar to CELOTEX I.

We may want actual copies of newspaper

stories for display, in addition to memos, should

DCI wish to use it.

MOCKINGBIRD

No recorded (in CIA) formal approval by

Attorney General. It may be that Justice will

have a copy.

Does this raise a question of surveillance®

of congressmen if one is contacted by someone

under surveillance?
