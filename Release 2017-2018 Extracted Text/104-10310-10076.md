We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana

cuba, was Mario MAURi who was accompanied by his wite, Naria

Antonieta MAURI. We have been unable to determine who trans-

mitted the information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we

have not been able to locate any documents relating to this

matter in Latin America Division files or the OEwald file.

We have been unable to locate any documents which

would

indle te that there was a response to DIR 86054 from

Mexico City.

4. Assuming there was no response to DIR 86054, the

originating Headquarters component should have initiated

followup action if a response was not received.

le have been unable to find any further information

relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.
