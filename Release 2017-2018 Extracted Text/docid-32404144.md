Central Intelligence Agency

Wastington, D C 20505

30 September: 1992

The Honorable Thomas S. Foley

Speaker of the House of Representatives

Washington, D.C.

20515

Dear Mr. Speaker:

As part of the Historical Review Program and in

anticipation of the passage of the Assassination Materials

• Disclosure Act of 1992, the Central Intelligence Agency

(CIA) has declassified

and is sending records related to the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy to the National

Archives.

We have already cleared approximately 35,000

pages of

documents for transfer to the Archives.

To help us

in this process, we seek the agreement of the House of

Representatives

to release CIA records that are part of a

segregated document collection established by agreement

between CIA and the House Select Committee on Assassinations

(HSCA) •

In August 1977, Director of Central Intelligence

Stansfield Turner and the HSCA agreed in a Memorandum of

Understanding to create, upon termination of the HSCA,

a segregated and secure

collection of all Agency documents

reviewed by the committee.

The documents were to remain

segregated within CIA for 30 vears unless the DCI and the

House of Representatives agreed to a shorter period of time.

In early 1978, the HSCA and the DCI revised the MOU to

provide that only those documents designated by the

HSCA--not all documents reviewed by the Committeer-would

be placed in this collection.

We established the secure

collection in accordance with the MOU, as modified.

I know that you share with me the commitment to

declassify and publicly disclose as many government docu-

ments as possible related to the assassination of President

Kennedy.

The House, by passing the Assassination Materials

Disclosure Act, has

also gone on record in supporting the

The Honorable Thomas S. Foley

release of such documents.

Your consent, on behalf of the

House, to the immediate

release of CIA records within the

segregated collection will enable the Agency to make its

records available to the National Archives as expeditiously

as possible.
