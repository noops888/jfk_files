Thru : DC/SRS and C/FIOB/SRS

FROM : M. D. Stevens

SUBJECT: CAIN, Richard S.

#272 141

DATE: 9 October 1967

1 Reference is made to the attached 5 June 1967 DCS memo.

randum on Subjects which in turn made reference to previous DCS

i memoranda on him on 24 and 25 May 1967 and to an Office of Security

memorandum dated 29 May 1967.

The 5 June 1967 memorandum

enclosed copies of several 1963/1964 documents from the Chicago

Field Office's file on CAIN, which ADC/PSD forwarded to SRS with

the comment that "It appears DCS is cleaning out their files Ie Lee

Harvey OSWALD, et al."

2. Subject, it is obvious, had been a source of information

regarding an alleged discussion of the assassination of President

Kennedy at a secret meeting of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee

held in Chicago in February 1963 under the direction of Richard

CRILEY (#346 116). He also was the source of information regarding

the alleged attempted recruitment into the Communist Party of young

Cubans in the Chicago area by one Guillermo ESCOBAR, who accorda

ing to the Chicago office was "one of

_ (SAS) leads

obtained from Ralph PEREZ." (Presumably Ralph PEREZ, #444260.)

→ #199499.

The documents also indicated

that in February 1964 CAIN was the subject of a conversation initiated

by Eldon S. COHEN, #38557 o/c, with a representative of the DCS

Chicago office who believed his purpose was to learn whether or not

CAIN was in fact on a two-month's sick leave from the COOK County

Sheriff's office, as he was said to be, or was on a political under

cover assignment which CCHEN inferred involved tapping the tele

• phones of gubernatorial candidate Charles H. PERCY and other

political figures.

3. During review of CAIN's Security file, I noted a message

regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962, which mentioned

a "Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"

who obviously had had contact of some kind with CAIN, as well as with

a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. Il (Acopy of this memo

randum is attached). In answer to this message which reguested traces

n CAIN, Headguarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard

ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS, nor a claim

he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be substantiated.

The

Station was advised that he did have (or had had) a legitimate detective.

laboratory in Chicago.

5. The fittime CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office

sas when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request

stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which

he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches in

Chicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico

was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police

methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector;

and had added that he was investigating. Communism in a certain unnamed

Central American country.

6. In June 1962, the Mexico Station advised that CAIN was being

deported by the Mexican Ministry (of) Gobernacion for these violations:

a. Carrying a loaded revolver and brass knuckles

b. Impersonating a Mexican Government official

(He had identification as an investigato, for the

Mexican Treasury Office.)

c. Violating his tourist permit by working at his

detective office and at the Mexican Treasury

Subject was subseguently of interest to the DCS in September

1963 when an ad hoc clearance was requested to permit his being asked

to respond to general requirements regarding his knowlodge of certain

Cuban refugees and their potential for foreign positive intelligence. On

10 September 1963, the DCS was sent a memorandum which furnished

much of the above information on CAIN.

8. On 22 May 1967, the Director of Security indicated that he

had received information from the FBI which ties Subject to the Mafia

in Chicago; and he directed that the DCS be contacted for information

as to whether or not they ever established contact with him and, if so,

for what purpose. The DOS was also to be advised that, if they were

in contact with him, it was suggested that they break it oil. On 25

May 1967, the DCS advised that there had been no contact with CAIN

since 1963, and furnished copies of eight reports for which Subject had

been the source of information. These had to do with anti-Castro Cuban

activities, procurement of arms, etc.

9. On 29 May 1967, Security advised the DCS that there is a

current FBI investigative interest in Subject and recommended that

"there be no further contact with him at this time.

The 1 September 1967 copy of Life magazine contains an

article titled "Brazen Empire of Organized Crime," in shich it is

stated that Sam GIANCANA, Head of the Chicagö

a private investigator."
