which has as its purpose, as stated in its Icolaration of

Principles, the overthrow of the U. S. Government, the

institution of a dictatorship of the vorking class, and the

eventual achievemont of a cormunist society.

In Dunne V. U. Sir the court considered the

Declaration of Principles and said,

"The Doclaration sets forth the program

of action to effectuace this overthror of

the existing capitalist society and the

Government which supporto it. The first

step is to build the acrength of the party

so that it can have a najority of the

The final stop is to overthrow the cristing

Government by force."

FOREICH INFLUSHCE

Camojo denies that the I'TP is run by a forcign pover

of orranisation and stacos that SiP Members are

"internationalists"

who "maintain a relationahip of fraternal

solidarity with the Fourth Intemational."

The 1938 Declaration of Principles states,

"The revolutionary party in the United itates

collaborateo in the fullosi moasure with all

groups, organizations and parties in all other

countries standing on the same fundarental

program as our oi: and cooperates with them

in the elaboration of a complote vorld

progran. the s.l.P., thorofore, is affiliated

with the fureau for the Fourth International

as its section in United States.*

Canejo stated, "And although we strongly disagree

with the

Voorhis let, since it was passed in 1940 ve have not

boen affiliated to the Fourth International."

In Dunne v. U. Sa

the court discusses an attorpt to suspend and withdraw the

Declaration of Principles anú quotes dofendant James P.. Cannon

(founder and leader of the SWP until his doath in 1974) as

10110÷5:

"The principal Icason,

I nay say, was the passage

by Congross of a bill Inown as the Voochis ict, which penalizod

parties belonging to international organizations."

The court

thon concluded,

"ron as to the Voorhis hot, this action was

norcly a subterfuge and sholio scraen." Another quote fron

seens particularly appropriace when considering

tion while also folloving rotsky's toaching that communism

cannot be established with lastino success as an isolated

phenonenon in one country alone.

The court said,

"then they use words which nay or nay

The Fourth International continues to be the

vorldride Irotskyist revolutionary organization and is

presently headquartered in Brussels, Palmiu:

Although

claiming to have withdrawn fron fornal affiliation in 1940,

the ist continues to maintain a close association with

the

FI and participates and votes as a "sympathizing group" in

FI neetings.

The 1975 Prospects for a Socialist Novolution states:

"The Marrist model for construatiny a

rovolutionary program in the irperialist

epoch is the founding document of the

Fourth International, the world party of

socialist revolution, founded by Icon trotsky

in 1938."

"The socialist Workers Party is internationalist

ADVOCACY OF VIOLENCE

Carejo stated that the SiP "Joosn't advocate or

engage in violent or illegal notivity.

The IDI has never

produced any evidence to the contrary."

[I. "aClory asked

Camojo if the suit hain't originally advocated the overthrow

of the Governmen't by force of violence.

The court in Dunne V. U.S. considered the above and

other quotes fron the Declaration of trinciples and concluded

that the sip bolieved the 'final step is to overthrow the

The sip does not publicly espouse violence or

as Marists have alrays believed, that the philosophy and

the mathods of terrorism are damaging to the rockers

the majority position of the Fourch International

foi their support of the FI position which favors the current

use of guerrilla varfare in Latin America and elsevhere it

local conditions indicate that such violence would enhance the

revolution.

Father, they vere expolled for operating in

secrecy in violation of SiP dircctives governing its own

oporations. In fact, the majority of the sup did not reject

violence per se but refused to support the II position bocause

they felt the use of violence vas then premature. Some of the

followers of the Il position have been rcaccopted into the

StI by reneving their unconditional acceptance of the leadership

bodies of the SUIP.

within their proscribed mandate and subject to the rules of

confidence.

*ix. lurtagh alleged that the Bureau uses harsh dis-

ciplinary measures.

The standards of conduct of the rBI are

based on and are in accordance with the Nepartment of Justice

Order 350-65 and the Codo of Federal Regulations. Administra-

tive action for failure to moet these known and established

Standards is handled promptly and fairly. No administrative

action is ever talion tithout first obtaining an explanation

from the employec involved.

Disciplinary policies of the mid-

1960s vere no difforent than in previous decades and little

difforont than at present.

"r, "urtagh's allegation that dis-

ciplinary measures had so croded Agents' confidence in Ir. Hoover

by the mid-1960s that the policy "tell the man nothing" reached

the point there burcau suporvisors did not furnish ir. Hoover

with information that had come co their attention for fear of

reprisal, is without factual kasis, is not documented, and

appears to le a matter of Muriagh's personal opinion.

ix. Hurtagh alleged Agents under My. Hoover had no

avenuc through which they could air grievances involving

unothical or illegal practices. This is not true. If askod

or roquirod to take part in something illegal or unothical or

outside the igent's jol description his ovious initial re-

course would be to report same to the next higher supervisory

authority.

Since lurcagh insinuated that internal channels

rould not be

responsive to accepting or forwarding such

griovances, it nust also be pointed out that Agents could

Toscimony of Arthur lurtagh before the Select

Iir. lurtagh alleges that the FBI has carefully

selectod Agent personnel who vere politically disposod to

the right.

The FBI is exceptod from the compatitive Civil Service

in our employment of both Special Agents and clerical personnel.

Our omploycos are selected based on educational qualifications,

personal interviers, appropriate tooting and rigid bachground

investigations.

io instructiong have ever keen issued to deter

mine the political affiliation of applicants for employment

with the FBI.

Political affiliation or persuasion is not now

and has never lucen a prerequisite for employment.

Additionally, ilt. Murtagh alleges that thousands of

Agents have been forced to lcave the Bureau in "utter disgust."

This is not corroborated by the facts.

studies reveal that the turnover rate of Special Agents is con

sistently below that in the Faderal Government and private

industry.

In the first place, large numbers of Agents have not

resigned and no information has come to our attention that vould

in any vay indicate that large numbers of Agents have resigned

in "utter disgust."

He also suggests that either the salary scale for

Special Agents should be reduced or that we should establish

educational requirements to justify our high pay standards.

The starting grade for a Special Agent in the FBI is GS-10.

The U. S. Civil Sorvice Commission has found this position to

be correctly classified in grade GS-10, based on a thorough

study of all pertinent background infornation including the

caucational, physical and other qualification standards for

recruitnent, training courses and facilities, examination of

typical, practical case prosiens and a study of the scope oi

FBI jurisdiction and the numerous duties and responsibilities

of Special lgent personnel:

Classification standards for the

criminal investigating scries GS-1811 vere revised in Fcbruary,

1972, and information therein continues to support GS-10 as the

entrance level for Special Agents.

Testimony of Arthur

Kurtagh before the Select

Committee on Intelligence, Fovember 18, 1975

Ax. Murtagh recommends that to insure against re

establishment of uncontrollable power within the Bureau that

Agont selection be a legislative process so that future per-

sonnel would represent the full spectrum of American society

instead of only a narrow segment as it now does.

Our current Special Agent complement is made up of a

cross section of Americans representing all valks of life,

races and creeds.

All applications received are thoroughly

reviewed and treated in a like manner without regard to an

individual's station in life.

Equal opportunity is, and has been, an established

policy of the FBI.

The Bureau has applied an unqualified

policy of considering each applicant for employment without

regard to race or any other discriminatory factor. Over the

years ve have emphasized and reemphasized not only the need

but the desire to attract minority applicants to our ranks in

order to be representative of the American people and fulfill

our responsibilities.

In support of his allegation that the FBI practiced

institutional racisn in hiring, Ar. Murtagh also attributed to

Mir. (James B.) Adams of the FBI a statement to the effect that

Hurtagh's hiring of blacks for the Bureau's work force, would

have to be stopped.

Mr. Adams categorically denies having made any such

statement and the IBI's record of affirmative action in re

cruiting black employees belies any such statement.

TESTIMONY OF LORI PATON BEFORE THE GELECT

COMITTEE ON IITTILIGEICE, NOVELBER 18, 1975

Regarding statements before the United States House

Select Cormittee on Intelligence Nctivities (ISC) made by lori

Paton, the Federal Bureau of Investigntion (FBI) would like

to place the FBI's inquiry on Paton in proper perspective.

It

is inportant to note that the inguiry stemmed from the FBI's

investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SUP), the largest

Trotskyist-cormunist party in the United states.

Paton states she was subjected to public exposure and

suffered embarrassment and humiliation.

while the Fat did, of

course, conduct an inquiry to determine Paton's identity, the

FBI did not publicize that fact. The FBI prepared no formal

report on Paton and no information on her vas disseminated.

The FBI has maintained throughout the course of the civil action

instituted by is. Paton that it did not cause any of the alleged

notoriety and publicity following the inquiry.

The United States

Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit noted in its recent

opinion, "It would appear that a factfinder could conclude

this record that the investigation first became publicized

through the efforts of Gabrielson."

Mr. Gabrielson was the

chairman of the high school's social studies departnont but was

not the teacher of the class for which Paton wrote her letter

to the SuP.

Paton said she felt she should have been contacted by

the Agent.

This was not possible until she was identified. once

she was identified and the purpose of her contact with the SIP

was known, there no longer existed any Icason to contact her.

The reason for her contact with the SiP became known during the

Assoc. Dir. _ investigation,

It was concluded that she was not involved in

She states she was concerned about the Government

keeping a record on her as she might sone day sook covernment

criploynent.

She then filed suit to find out why she had been

investigated and to have har file destroyed. The Government

argued that her file vas an accurate record of a lawful inquiry.

and thus the FBI vas prohibited by Federal laws from destroying

her file. This mattor is still in litigation.

Rogarding Paton's attorney's request, on June 13, 1973,

a letter was directed to the Special Agent in Charge (SAC),

Hovark Office, FBI, with copies to the Acting Director, FBI and

of Rutgers University, School of Law, Constitutional Litigation

In this letter, Askin stated he was

making inquiry on bohalf of is. Lori Paton and Millian Gabrielcon,

Chairnan of the Social Studies Departrent, "endhan High School.

He said the inquiry vas prompted by a lettor sent by lls. Paton to

the Socialist labor Party in lew York, secling infomation for a

school project.

thai she and hor fonily verc

investigation.

He denanded to receive an answer fron the sac,

Rewark, to the following questions within five days, threatening

to take further action if a satisfactory answer was not received

by June 20, 1973.

"1. Now did the FBI learn of 1is. Paton's lotter to

the Socialist Labor Party?

2.

Does the FBI maintain a general policy of survail-

was

founded in the United States in 1938 as the

Amcrican section of the worldwide Trotskyist-communist

revolutionary organization named the Fourth International

(FI), which is headquartered in Europc. The fI was founded

in 1938 in Europe and embodies the ideology of Leon Trotsky

concerning the application of Marxism and the need

for

continuing revolution in the world to achieve communism.

:: i

In 1940, SVP withdrew its formal affiliation with

the FI to escape application of the Voorhis Act, which

regulates certain types of organizations subject to foreign

controi. Since 1940, however, SiP has conducted a close

association with the FI (a majority of which endorses and

supports the current use of violence) and SiP participates

and votes as i "syapathizing group" in FI meetings. See

SVP Internal Infornation Bulletin, dated Aprii, 1971, and.

International Internal Discussion Bulletin, dated April,

1974, annexed hereto.

While the SWP and YSA are not known by the FBI

to publicly advocate the use of violence at the present

time, these organizations maintain that eventual violent

revolution is incvitable. SHP and ISA seek to precipitate

sevolution when conditions are perceived by them to be ripe,

and

seek to seize control of and direct the revolution when

It occurs. Specifically, SWP and YSA are not known by

the FBI to have rejected the use of violent and illegal

means to achieve their purposes. Rather, information

received by the FBI indicates that SWP and YSA would use

violent and illegal means to achiove their purposes if such

mcans were considered by SYP and YSA as being expedient.

An important minority faction within the SiP intonds to

take all nocossary steps to effectively implement FI

decisions. See SYP Internal Infoiration Bulletin annexed

heroto.

successful strategy for socialist revolution was that

of the Russian Bölsheviks ir 1917."

James P. Cannon, longtime leader of SUP who

was

named as

a plaintiff in this case, has stated that

"It is the opinion of all Marxists that it (social

transformation) vill be accompanied by violence." (Quoted

from "Socialism on Trial," by James P. Cannon, Pathfinder

Press, 5th Edition, 1973, at page 1S5.j With reference iù

this very lawsuit, Cannon subsequently stated 'we

exploit the cracks and crevices in the bourgeois-democratic

system without paying the slightest respect to it."

• Quoted from the SVP newspaper "The Militant," issue

dated January 25, 1974, at page 7.)

It may also be noted on February 20, 1974,

Kevin T. Maroney, Deputy

Assistant Attorney General,

Criminal Division, Department of Justice, appeared before

the Committce on Internal Security, House of Representativos,

and testified concerning the domestic intelligence gathering

function of the FBI. A copy of Mr. Maroney's statement is

ILC MINORITY REPORT ON WORLD POLITICAL

SITUATION by Hans.

•Seasion recessed for lunch at 1:20 p.m.

Session reconvened at 3:05 p.m.

Chair reads siclement from Sicedish delegation: The

Swedish delegation prolests against the presence of Com-

rade Anders at this Congress who is not a delegate. The

leadership of the Swedish organization has neither been

Informed nor consulted prior to this accomplished fact.

This sisows that the so-cailed Leninist-Trotskyist Faction

places ils own factional interests and discipline above

the luterests and discipline of the sections of which they

are members.

Motion from lalian delegation by Edgardo: Not lo per-

mit Luigi to report on Iorid

Political

Situation for

Michrayonka Tendency because be is not a delegate.

Declaration of vote of Ilalian delegation:

The Italian delegation protests Comrade Luigi's partici-

pation in the proceedings of the Tenih Congress:

1. Because the delugalion does not feel that a minority

declaretlon is suilicient grounds ior having the rigle 1o

be seated and have voice at the world congress, especinlly

when insuficient votes were.cast lo elect a dcicgare ihis

right is reserved for delegates and members of outgoing

Jeaderships;

2. Because the molon put forth by Comrade I.'s ten-

dency at the congress

oi the Italian section asking ap-

proval to send one member of the lendency to the sorid

congress was rejectid by the vast majority of ine dele

gaies.

The Italian delegation feels that the Compass Tendency's

statement acknowledging ils erroneou's nethod was com-

pleiciy superfluous:

1. Because it involved the revetition of an error-l's

attendance

at the congress of the Walloon seciion having

gone against the advice of the section iscif-while at ibe

same time a nceling of the italian Central Comminse,

of waich L. is a member, was being reid;

2. Because it isn't worth very much lo make a self-

criticism that has no consequences. Givea the situarion.

the consequences should have incided ine rciusal io ad-

mil Comrade L. and the rejecion of a policy of mai-

ing ialt accompli decisions.

• Unanimous decison of the Itallan delegation.

Discussion Against Herb.

Chair read statement from United Sccretarial resom-

mending that Luigi be permited to bc a reporter:

1. Normal procedure requires that al a world congress

the reporters shoulá be either delegaies or members of

the IEC.

2. In case of small but recognized international tendes-

cles that have declared themseives as such on the basis

oi a writen platiorn, and in order lo prust user sexus

to full democratic participation in the discussion: the coa-

gress can make an exception and grant iom the riza:

to designate nondcicgaics as reporters if they think i: is

in the best interests of deionding their political positions

to do so. However, such proposals must be made ihrough

normal organizational channels and the leadership of ie

sections Involved must be consulled prior to submitting

their proposals to the congress.

3. In the case of lhe iniernational Compass Tendcac;

which has just indicaled lis programmatic basis in a

written form (see allachment +1) and which has desig-

nated Comrade Luigi as their reporter for the pollacai

resolution at the world congress, the United Secretariar

regreis that this procedure was not foilowed. The United

Secretariat notes that the international Compass Tendency

has itscif recognized that it made a mistale by no: doing

so. But in order lo underline the widest application of

tendency rights at this congress, the United Secretariat

suggests granting the International Compass Tezaracy

Its request.

Vole on Edgardo motion:

For, 45; against, 108; abstentions, 23.

2. No

reduction in status of groups currently recog-

3. Adoption of a general formulá to determine starus

in the following special situation:

In countries where adherents of the Fourth Interaa-

as a section, but all groups shall be recogniza

nize the united group as a suctior..

These are exceptional measures not lo be taken as

these measures to encourage splits by giving minor:-

groups the hope that they will receive recognition fron

2. That all scutions and sympathizing groups be granted

full voting rights at the next world congress in accordance

epeciled in the states of the Fourth International.

'3. That the present temporary starutas of the Fourth

it appears unlikely that these can be placed in ine rands

of the rank and file before the conterences où the sections

are beld to choose delegates for the nes norld conaress.

To overcome this difficulty and thus help lo assure a

full democratic discussion and election of zorld

con-

gress delegates, the United Secretariat thorafore uaani-

mously recommends so membership of tic I.E.C. posi

ponement of the world congress. In accordance with the

nes date it also recommends that the final date for sus-

mission of material be set approximately three monias in

advance of the world congress. The United Secretariat is

not bound to transiate and publisk material submilled

after that date.

All national pre-world congress conferences should be

rescheduled to be held as close to the world congress as

practical, but not earlier than t weeks before the congress.

Some comrades have expressed fear that the deisy in

transiating documents might be part of a process

would bring into question the authoritativeness of the

next world congress.

Secretariat is of the unanimous opinion

that fulfillment of the following conditions, regardless o

the date of the congress, will assure recugnition of ire

statutory authority of the decisions of the next world

the official formation oi an international tendency sor the

10th World Congress (4th since Reunitication) of the 4th

International.

This third international lendency is the outcome of the

political strungle of these tendencies and comrades in their

rections during lne Pie-il'orld-Congress discussion period

againsi the political and meinodorogical errors and in-

sufficiencies which, as we see it, are invoived with icy

important draft resoiutions of the lorid Congress. This

This common agreement was expressed in the Communi-

que of Frankfort from Nov. 18, 1973 (1IDB 24). In

this silvation, the formal deciaration oi a third inierna-

tonal tendency for the 10th World Congress based on po-

litical agreement in key important questions, is a neces-

cludes also to give critical support lo the baiance sheer

of the LTF on our experience with the gih ioria Con-

gress line in Argentina and bolivia, eg. lo vole for ihe

general line of part 2 and 3 of "Argentina and Boiivia -

The Balance Shect."

to defend the unity of our movement against the dan-

ger of a split in an organized way.

This international lendency is based on the following

posilions:

Kompass-Tendenz/GIM (Germany); Kempass-Tendency/

RSF (Denmark); T.ÀI.R./GCR (Raly); Arasio (member

of the steering commitice of Contre le Courant-iendency/

Wallonia).

Attachment 2: Why l Did Not Join the Third International Tendency

1. The creation of 4 national tendencies (Kompass-.

an orientation for the militants of the Fourth International

GIM1, TMIR- GCE, CLC - wallonia, Mompass - RSF) and

• the perspective of creating a thid international (endency

a) the analysis made by the 4 tendencies of the blind

alley into which the LTE and the INT had led the IVth

International - notably on the level of the funciioning of

Its leadership.

b) an extremely critical appreciation of the analyses of-

fered by the IMT on Eurnpe and even more on a world

scale we have alondy emphasized the cronevus method

of these analyses -objectivist and carastrophis.

c) the incapacity ot lie IMT lo offer a serious political

and organizotional balance 3heet of the orientation adopted

by the 9ih World Congress on Latin America; the succes-

sion of thirce or four documenis on Argentina and Eolivia:

the linal submission for vole at the Tenth World Congress

of a text entirled "Balance Sheet of the Arned Struggle in

Latin America which is. not a balance sheet and even less

overcome its current internal crisis.

The lateness and the content oi the LTF worid counter-

resolution; the partial character of its positions on Europe

and on the perspectives of revolutionary Marxists on his

continent; its circumspection -which tends io

make one

suspicious -concerning the dubious politics of the PRTÜ

and the PST-despile the correctness of many criticisms

it makes of the IMIT's Latin American postions: lis er-

roneous conception of political debate in a Leninist or-

ganization which applies demöcratic centralism (forming

a faction) all this has convinced us of the objective need

to break the IMIT/LTF 'duo' and lo begin lo present lo

the militants of the fl a proolematic and perspectives

which have been brought to the fore by the 3rd inier-

national lendency.

necessity/ subjective capacity come into play.

a) Two of the four tendencies within it (Kompass/ GIM

and TMR/GCR, were formed in the context of a racional

gress. This partly explains the lateness of the two others

(CLC and Kompass' Denmark) with respect to the work-

b) Although a nationai tendency may legitimately be

formed around a single issue, for an international

Dear Comrades,

The Bolchevik-Leninist Group of Vielnam (BLV), sends

you ils fraternal greetings and wishes the Congress great

success in keping with our great hopes.

We know tha, serious subjects are presently being dis-

cussed in the International, especially the Vietnamese prob-

lem. We deeply regret that for materiai reasons (date of

the Congress became known too laie, passporis, visas ...)

the BLV Is absent irom your debates. lie regret it all the

more because our group does not have the same position

as the International nor the comrades of lhe caposition.

We could contribule original ideas is Vietnamese Troisisy-

•Ists, having been able to read many Vietnamese documents

hardly known outside of the country.

Our BiV group was corstitured as a section of the inter-

national In 1947, by joining the International. It has a

long history behind it. Is was our group shat had suc

cessiully led, during the 194G-1953 period, the movement

of 20,000 emigrant workers in France. During this period,

it was able lo train nos cadres 1500 cadress who for ine

most part were sent to lurth Vietnam. Our group ras

able lo resist the must brutal repression of french im-

perialism during the first war in Vietnam.

Since the departure to Vietnam of most of our comrades

a small group remains in France and carries on in spite

of e thousand difficulties. It is the present defender of lei-

namese Trotsiyisi traditions and icieas.

Although for tactical reasons we don't officially identit;

-ourselves in ous press as Trolskvisis, all the Vietnamese

political circies in France know oi our exisierce, especial:

Dear Comrades,

one side in le debale, As cou kaos, the couriri where.

provide us with sullicient natice it was impossible lo get

the visas. Thus we were unable to atend the congress.

2. The resolution on balin America passed at the last

world congress,

which

included an orientation loward

guerrilia war, has been proved by mients lo haue hpon

completeiy wrong in the lo countries where it was tested

out— Argentina and Bolivia.

Recent developrients in Bolivia further underscore this:

the new rise of a peasant movement and the strike actions

of the miners and other sections of the workers.

The question is posed: Are the Bolivian Trotskyists to

continue with the line of guerrilla war, or are they to

participate in this new mass movement in acco-dare=ia.

pensable tool for building the revolutionary party in Larin

America, in order to join with the masses in their struggies

and advance toward the taking of power.

Armed struggle must be added lo

all the mcans used

by revolutionaries. It does not negate or repiace all those

that have been used up to now. On the contrary, armed

struggle strengthens and insures them. It must not sub-

stitute for the masses, but rather it must bu an in-

dispensable instrument of their struggles.

The organiza-

tion must see to its implemenration, in this way taking

on a vanguard role.

In order for the proietarial lo be able to arm itsell and

struggle for power, we revolutionaries musi prepare our-

seives beforchard, so that we are not surprised.by events.

This proparation is political and

military. To leave tire

military preparation io the moment when the masses are

ready to fight with arms in hand is criminal acgligence.

It is to forget the lessons of liare on the insurrection.

Today in Lain America, in order for an cuinchiic revo-

lusionary organicion lo insure lis permanent aristence,

to elude the repression, io be able lo take its propaganda

struggle along with all the other means we rcuolutionaries

Beginning from this point of departure, to the extent

that the class struggle sharens and the consciousness

of the masses gions, the parry will be strenginened and

the armed

struggle will be the indispensable instrumeni

for the taking of power by the proletariat.

In 1961

we were just beginning to understand these

probiems; the experiences were very costly but they could

and should have been used to advance to a deeper under-

standing of the question. Unfortunately conservative lead-

ers used the errors, which s'ere many, to absolve them-

ecives from responsibilities and not lo aid in overcoming

the errors critically. Thus we see leaders like Moreno who,

aller pushing military preparation, after approving ex-

propriations, and alter sending comrades to get military

training in Cuba, laced with those who have fallen and

the defeats, don't know how to do anything but beat a

retreat and avoid their responsibility; a leader who never

intended to personally take on the undoubtedly difficult

task of correculy applying armed struggle. How düferent

from the example of Irolsky who, at 40 years of age.

self at its head.

The truth is that in 1961 we didn't know anything about

military problems; when we look at Peru, we had nothing

-rescmbling a line, only the conviction that we had to

organize the military lask, because the mass movement

had made it indispensable: but in Argentina, where rather

than a rise in activity among the masses instead there had

been an cob since 1959, we also believed in the need 1o

organize the military lask, and in the possioility of guer-

rilla struggles. Thus the work in the North, in 'Fucuman,

was begun, with the sending of comrades there an ex.

propriation was carrica out. P. was in Peru and at the

2. The Present Francwork of the Polemic

•Today the role of armed struggle, among many other

things, is being debated in the International. I place myself

within the majority current but l believe it has short-

comings and errors that have facilitated the minority's

arguments. Alter the IX World Congress resolution on

were committed, which will have to be done with a deco

emerge regarding the best way lo usi armed strugete

without faliing into militarist deviations. Bur this solf-

criticism cannot be made from ihe relormist point of vie

of rejection of the use of a fundamental means oi action

for revolutionaries. Those who, while supporting the use

of armed struggle in words, are opposed to ils use in all

the countries in which they carry out their activity, and in

all the countrics that are being discussed, can scarcely helo

This is the basis of the present

debate. Supporters and opponcats oi armed struggle are

of the later crisis and split. Within dre PP.T those who

were partisans of 'armed siruggle and those who veren't

among the parlisans of the armed struggie thare was

confusion, many undoveloped shadings under the surlace.

Only practice would refine them, until it led finally 1o

had participated in in its beginnings, and fron which a

have given importance to the discussion which deveioped

at this time in Argentina among the three tendencies that

were established. So, can one deduce irom Santucho's

militarist deviation, which the United Secrearial supporied

valid? Absolutely not

One can and must deduce that it is necessary to eliminale

the deviations, that one mus: be very careiul, that the use

of armed strungle must answer the needs of the ciass

here with ige one adopted at the Ninth Congress for rec-

ognizing sections. At that time, when the siruation of the

PHT (Combalichte) and our orgnnization were being de

baled, Comrade Livio Maitan based the position for rec-

ognizing the PRT (C) exclusively

on the number of mili-

without considering. the political positions of each

of the organizations.

This criterion furthermore reflects putting factional in-

terests ahcad of those of the World Party and provides

a basis for judging the factionalist attitude that has given

this Congiess its undemocratic character.

We expressly request that ail the duegations be Informed

of this proicst, as the leadorship of the Fourth Internation-

al must stop commiting errors of this kind, where it has

gone to the length of openly discriminating against

organization that in ils

political development mediod

and practice stands on lie ground of orthodox Trolsitism.

We• have been subjected so ihis discrimination precisely

because our entire course shows that we will cortinue nur

fight to build the World farly oi te Socialist Revolution

and that in this fight we will oppose any mancuvers bi a

Icadership thrown up by an accidental majority that jeo-

pardize the future of world Trotskyism.

and we have participated in most oi the struggles of lihe

mass movement in our country since May 1968. when we

emerged as a party, consistently defending the positions

of orthodox Trotskyism.

Given the fact that groups having neither an organ nor

regular activity have been recognized as oilicial sections -

organizations which, moreover, have had nothing lo do

with the class struggle in their respcetive countries-this

discrimination against the Uruguayan Trotskyists can be

explained in

no other way but as a jactional mancuver

by the International majority to leep out vi the Fourth

International a section whose majority has adhered lo the

Icninist-Trotskyist minority tendency (and

Mx. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

I am happy to appear before you today on behalf of the

Department of Justice in response to your request for our views

on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's domestic intelligence-

gathering function and in particular the Bureau's authority and

responsibility to conduct such investigations.

Chairman Ichord is correct in noting that in recent times

and in fact over the last few

years serious questions have been

Iaised concerning the FBI's authority to investigate subversive

Gongress, logal scholars and journalists have addressed themselves

to this prosiem. The Department of Justice and in particular the

Federal Bureau of Investigation fully recognizes that its domestic

Intelligence-gathering functions must necessarily have a sound legal

basis and more significantly these functions must be carried out

in accordance with the great protections accorded all Americans

by the Bill of Rights. .

At the outset I would like to acknowledge a debt of

gratitude to your distinguished legislative counsel, Mr. Alfred M.

Nittle, for preparing his analysis of the statutory authority for

the Bureau's domestic intelligence activities. Mr. Nittle's

memorandum provides a good stazting point for members of your

Committce and others seeking to understand the difficult and

complex legal problems and considerations involved in under-

standing the FBI's domestic intelligence activities.

In response to your Committee's inquiry I shall

atteapt to set forth the basis for the FBI's authority and

responsibility to carry out its domestic intelligence activities,

while recognizing that additional constitutional, statutory and

Frenidential authority can and maybe also cited to sanction the

Broai range of FBI activities in the field of domestic intelligence,

particuiarly in instances of spocific investigations cartied out

pursuant to the request of the President or the Attorney General.

Broadly considared, the primary basis for the FBI's domestic

Intelligence activities is grounded in the constitutional powers

and responsibilities vested in the President under Article II of

che Constitution. The Supreme Court in United States v. United

States District Coust, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), in considering the

problem of varrantless electzonic surveillance in domestic

national sacurity cases observed:

"We begin the inquiry by noting that the

President of the United States has the fundamental

duty, under Axticle II, §1 of the Constitution 'to

preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of

the United States.' Implicit in that duty is the

power to protect our Government against those who

would subvert or overthrow it by unlawful means."

407 U.S. at 310..

Justice Powell, speaking for a unanimous Court, sub-

sequently added:.

"And unless Government safeguards its own capacity

to function and to preserve the security of its

people, society itself could become so disordered

that all rights and liberties would be endangered."

407 U.S. at 312.

Assistant Attorney General William H. Rehnquist, now

Justice Rehnquist, in testifying on the constitutional and

statutory sources of investigative authority in the Executive

Branch before the Subcormittee on Constitutional Rights of the

Senate Judiciary Committee on March 9, 1971, stated:

"The primary source of fedoral law enforcament

power emanates from Article II, section 3, of

the Constitution which assigns

to the President

the duty to '

... take Care that the Laws be

faithfully executed.

'The word [flaws has

been interpreted broadly by the Supreme Court as

encompassing not only statutes enacted by Congress

but

... the rights, duties and obligations

growing out of the Constitution itself, our

international relations and all the protection

implied by the nature of Government under the

Constitution.

In Re. Nagle, 135 U.S. 1, 64

(1890) ''

Furthermore,

we should also take cognizance of the

President's powers and responsibilities as Chief Executive,

Commander-in-Chief and his power to conduct our foreign relations.

This latter power, of course, relates more particularly to the

' Executive's power to conduct foreign intelligence activities here

and"äbroad. In addition, Article IV, '84, of the Constitution

provides that the United States shall guarantee to every State

of this Union a republican form of government and shall protect

them from invasion and on application of the legislature or of

the executive against domestic violence. In connection with

the foregoing I would call your attention to the fact that on

April 1, 1969, the President designated the Attorney General as

chief civilian officer to coordinate the Government's resporse to

civil disturbances. Às you may be aware, a great deal of comestio

intelligonce has pertained so this problem, particulariy in the

recent past.

: Without a broad range of intelligence information, the

President and the appropriate departments and agencies of the

• Executive Branch could not properly and adequately protect our

nation's security and enforce the numerous statutes pertaining

thereto. Perhaps the thought I have in mind has been best

,expressed in short form by the Supreme Court in the case of

Dennis v. United States: 341 V.S. 494 (1951), which upheld the

constitutional validity of the Smith Act. Title 18 U.S.C., Section

2385. In discussing the "clear and present danger" test the Court

warned:

'Is grounded in the numerous Federal criminal statutes found

throughout the United States Code which prohibit the type of

activity under investigation. Statutes dealing with treason,

espionage, sabotage, advocacy of violent overthrow of the Govern-

ment, bombing, aircraft piracy, assaults on foreign officials

activities afford the legal basis for practically all domestic

intelligence-type investigations. I will subnit as an appendis

to my statement a list uf significant statutes which serve as

a basis for the FBI's jurisdiction and authority for natioral

security investigations.

Pursuant to Title 3, Ü.S.fo, Section 301, the-President

is authorized to designate and empower the head of any department

or agency in the Executive Branch cr any öfficial thereof who

Is required to be appointed by and with the advice and consent

of the senate to perform without approval, racificacion or othe=

action by the Presidont, (1) any Function which is vested in

the President by lan or (2) any function which any officer is

requirad of authorized by law to perform only with or subject

to the approval, ratification or other action of the President.

Title 28 11.S.C., Section 509, provides that all functions

of other officers of the Depariment of Justice and all functions

of agencies and employees of the Department of Justice ace

vested in the Attorney Gencral, with certain limited exceptions.

Pursuant to Section 510 of Title 2a U.S.C. the Attorney General

may Exon time to time make such provisions as he considers

aspropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer,

employee or agency of the Department of Justice of any function

of the Attorney General.

Chapter 33 of Title 28, U.S.C., Sections 531-537,

deals with the Federal Bureau

: of Investigation, its director,

Its investigative and other officials; the acquisition, preserva-

tion and exchange of identification recoids and the

investigation

of crimes involving Government officers and employees. Section

533 provides:

"The Attorney General may appoint officials

(1) to detect and prosecute arimes against the

United States;

(2) to assist. in the protection of the Presicant and

(3)

to conduct such other investigations regarding

official matters under the control of the

Department of Justice and the Department

State as may be directed by the Attorney

General."

In addition, the functions of the FBI are more specifically

detailed in the Departmental regulations found in 28 C.F.R.,

Section 0.85-0.89.

In the words of former Director, John Edgar Hoover,

In appearing before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations on

March 2, 1972:

"The fundamental authority for the activities fo=

the Federal Bureau of Investigation is contained

in Chapter 33 of title 28, United States Code."

• Investigations are the Presidential directives issued by

Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Eisenhower, as well as Executive

Order 9835 issued by President Iruman on Maron 21, 1947, and its

successor, Esecutive Order 10450 issued on April 27, 1953, by Presi-

dent Eisenhower. In addition, Executive Order 10450 was amended

by Executive Order 11605 issued on July 2, 1971, by President

Nixon. The first three of the Presidential directives are arniy

discussed by Mir. Nittle in his memorandum, and your Committee is

quite familiar with the history and purpose

of the aforementiorrd

Executive Orders. Section 0.85(d) of the Departmental reguiatior:

Found in 28 C.F.R. and pertaining to the Federal Burcau of

Investigation specifies that subject to the general supervision

and direction of the Attorney General, the Director of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation shall: •

(a) Carry out the Presidential directive of

December 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presidential

directives

0i Jaruazy'8, 1943, July 24, 1950

and Decembez 15, 1953, designating the

Federat

Bureau of Investigation to take charac: 0s

espionage, sabotage, subversive activities and

related maticis.

•Copies of these Presidential Directives have also been made

part of the Appendix to my statement.

We recognize the complexity and difficulty of adequately

spelling out the FBI's authority and responsibility to conduct

domestic intelligence-type investigations. The concept of

national security is admittedly a broad one, while the term

subversive activities is even more difficult to define. However,

as the Supreme Court has recognized in numerous opinions, the

Government has a right, in fact a duty, to protect itself

from destruction and to safeguard its institutions from violenca

and forcible overthrow. The problems inherent in this comple::

field are touched upon by the Supreme Couff in United States v.

United States District Court, at page 322:

"We recognize that domestic security surveillance

may involve different policy and practical

considerations from the surveillance of 'ordinary

The gathering of security intelligence

Is often long-range and involves the interrelation

of various sources and types of information.

The exact targets of such surveillance

may be more difficult to identify than in

surveillance operations against many types of crine

of domestic inteiligence gathering is on the

have at this time.

tional Program and of the role of the revolutionary van-

Il was the adoption of the resolution on the "Building

International Executive Committee Plenum of December

1972 which led in ine ollicial announcement of the Mi-

notily Tendency. It was the Minority's vote against this

resolution which led to the formation of the International

Majority tendercy.

In fact, the leadership of the future Minority Terdency

had long before been making criticisms of the activity

of the European sections. This -tended lo focus in par-

ticular around a vicious campaign against the yourg

British section, the INiti. But as early as June 1952, Con-

VI. The organizational settlement

The stratogy of the IMT to the world congress had been

to make a certain number of organizational concessions

(postponement of the world congress, limitation of the

issues to be settled, proportional representation of LT'F

groups outside the Fourth International) in order to insure

a charlication of the key political dutcrences. THE IIT

THUS WON A CLEAR POLITICAL MAJORITY IN THE

DERATE. The World Congress had lo scule two organiza-

tional questiors: the credentiais of voting mandates claimed

by several groups. and the post-conaress caras of a ricole

number of groues aspiring to becoine sochors. Ore of the

main considerations in this mailer was lo establish the

authority of la. Word Congress.

Although there were numerous grounds on zaich the

credentials commince couid have challenged the figures

of the PST and others, it was agreed inat in order co

avoid a giant organizational hassle, no credentials what-

soever would be challenged. it is very difliculi lo gauge

and shouied him down for tenty

minutes with chants of "Si O No" (Yes or No) calls into

question the seriousness of this organization's interest in

T'rotskyism. The question of the lack of a candidacy pro-

gram is not irrelevant either. Althougn the development

of the YSA modifics the judgment, ine SWP is obviously

aifecled by the absence of such a requirement di political

education and commitment. What can be said then about

formations like the P§l' who recruit directly to temselves,

or like the Mexican LS which claimed to have grown

threefold in the two months before ihe deadline for the

for the world congress? Unfortunately, the congress was

not able do fully clarify such questions, but it reiusea to

establish a precedent for further such breaches.

The final voling results are not available to us at this

time. The voling took place by placing check marks on

questionnaires. Horever the provisional figures on voting

results fell inlo three categories: the vore of sections: the

unchallenged roles of all present; and the ununimousiy

agreed to estimate of proportional representation for the

IEC. The first caregory, which is ine voting procedure

outlined by the slalutes of the Fl, and which is based on

only the voles of recornind sections of the f'l (this does

not include former secions like tre SiP of other organi-

zations like

Preliminary Repori to New York Caucus

of the Leninist-Trotskyist Faction on Fourth World

Congress Since Reunification (Tenth World Congress)

By Joseph Hanson

I have been asked

to present a balance sheet of the

Fourth World Congress of the Fourin International Since

Reunification (Tenth World Congress) from the viewpoint

of the Leninist-Trotskyist Faction.

Some of the conclu-

aions I will offer are subject to modification alier sie have

had

an opportunity to siudy the linai versions of the

documents presented at the congress by the iriernational

Executive Commince Majority

Tendersy.

These were

adopted by a majority of delegates bur mere subject lo

amendment and lo eding, and

are no: yet availabie.

On arrangements at the contress there das a consider.

able impro:ement over the congress heid in 1969. The

facilities were bener in cererai. For the frsi lime the prob-

Jem of translations was met in

an

accorale way. With

the up-to-date equipment that was used, it was possible

to have simultantous transiations in three languages —

Spanish, French, and Engiish. The time for discussion

was thus utilized much more efficiently than at any pre

Flous congress.

The congress was the largest yet held by the Fourth

International. Delegates and observers were present from

all continents end all the major countries except the Soviet

bioc.

Isi, addition lo delegates elected by official sections of

the Fourth International, the congress was oden to ob-

servers from sympathizing organizations-like the So-

clalist Workers Pariy-which are prevented by reaction-

ary legislation in their own countries from affiliat-

ing to the International. Such observers were invited

to express their ricis on ali dispuled political quesiions.

The discussion, which was quite intensive, centured on

fssues of the grearest importance.to the future of the world

Trotskyist movement. Some oi the differences were sharp

• and deep-going.

To understand the congress, its limitations, and its out-

corne, it is necessary to bear in mind the contert in which

It was held. The context was a crisis in the orientation and

leadership of the Fourth International.

The general outline of the development of this crisis

can be indicated by noting the key, points in the deepen-

Ing Internal differentiation.

The dillerences can be pegged roughly as having origi.

nated in the «dontion by the Ninth Worid Congress oi

a "turn" that included an orientation toward "rural ruer-

silla warlare." A minority at that congress voiced sirong

opposition to the new öriencation, predicting that the "turn"

could do serious damage to the Fourth

International.

and that if it were persisted in it would spread beyond

Jatin America and begin to impinge on the basic princi-

ples of our morement.

The debare on thia question d'as resumed about a year

after the Ninth World Congress. Already it was possible

to dran

certain

conclusions from the test of evenis. and

these were made more emphatic by further devc'opper's

including the desertion of the PRT (Combaterie). is

official Argentine section of the Fourth international.

The crisis in orientation and icadersao dé the Four

Iniernational was preciprated by the fature of inose ra

sponsible for the adoption of the orientatior toward cural

guerrilla waríare, and laier urban queralia mariare to

recognize the lessons of the evenis in

genuna. This was shown by the documenis they crote

going to great lengias in the cort to just their coursa

and by te criension of their erraneous ine in a reii-

fied form io other areas. ("The Bulding of Perciatio-ari

Parties in Capitalist Europe.") Their insisience on cei

misiaken course was formalized in the posiniors te; 5a-

heid al the pienum of the International Executive Co-

mittee in December 1972.

The IEC plenum was followed by a sharpening class

Ine minority sought.lo reverse the guerrilla war ories-

The outcome of this situation was the unanimously

agrred upon ten-point agrcenchi of Sepiember 19, 1973.

from expulsions or suspensions or application of disci-

milment to translate and • circuiate ail contributions to

the international internal discussion builetin in at least

Another important item was to hold over for further

discussion the following questions: (1) the "cultural rev-

(3) women's liberation, (1) the Middle East (5) Viet-

nam. It tas agreed to publish a monthly internal bul-

jeets.

It was also agreed that the next congress would be'held

within two years.

In face of the deepening and widening differences in the

movement as a whole, the ten-point agrcement outlined a

possible inodus vivendi until the next congress. However,

it remained to be sech what would háppen at the congress

A Now Poini Added lo Agenda

The actual agenda turned out to be somewhat different

from what had been

agreed on in

September.

In par-

ticular, a point called "Armed Siruggle in Latin America"

was Included -1 will come ivier to the reason for ihis-

so that the actual order was as folloirs: (1) world po-

probiem of initiatives in action, of "minority violence"

and of "injecting vioience into the class struggic."

It inciudes criticisms of particuiar iormulations mada

at the Minth Word Congress

in relation to the "iurn"

adopted then, but these are secondary.

The reporter theorized on the question of "armed strug.

. As lor the Leninist-Trotskyist facion, i's main post-

tions on these questions should be presented in a quite

different order inasmuch as its objective was lo put up

the strongest possible case for reversing a wrong orien-

On both Bollera and Argentina,

the reporters for the

turo respectively, siarted from the concrete siluations in

Finally, on the morid political situation, Comrade Jack

Barnes, explaining the vies of the Leninist-Troiskyist

Faction offered a broad analysis oi the objective reality

'for the past few decades. The purpose of this was to call

special altention to the changing paitern of the worid

revolution, which was now bringing to the fore the lead-

ing role of the rorking class, inciuding in the imperialist

centers, and opening up immense new opportanities for

the world Trotskyist movement. in takinz up the tasks

facing the Fourth International, he cailed for a realistic

assessment of the stage of devclopment of the Fourth in-

ternational and particuiarly of the resources at its dis-

posid. It this were done then the morid Trols"yist move

ment had every reason to count on highly encouraging

advances in the coming period.

In general, what the Leninist-Trotskyist Faction sought

to do at the congress was the lollowing.

1. Clarily the issues,

pariicularly the meaning of the

resolution

on "armed

the Internatioral Executive Commisce Mi-jority T'endency.

on armed struggle passed by the Minih World Congress

was about, Comrade liailan included the iollowing:

"That it was imperious for sections of the Fourth 'Inter-

national particularly in certain countries (Bolivia, Ar-

gentina) - where the threshold of a minimum accumula-

tion of cadres had alrezay been rcached. nei oniy to elab-

orate an orientation for armed struggia bur also to en-

form of armed struggle as this particular stage."

Bolivia and

weld that such actions set examples for the masses lo which

they can be expected to respond.

But this is quite falsc.

Indivlduals may respond but not masses.

What the theory of "exemplary actions" on a small scale

expresses is the hope of radicalized polty-bourgeols ele

for the theory of an allezed dialectic between "minority

violence" and "majority violence."

From this angle, what does the theory of the "new mass

Role of the Leninist-Troiskyist Faction

In conclusion, a lew words on how the Leninist-Irot-

skyist Faction functioned.

Another objective of the Leninist-Troiskvist Faction Fas

to do lis utmost lo block any soliting moves. i:s cou:se

was decisive, in my opinion, in enabling the congress

to chalk up a success in this respec.

Finally, the Leninist-Trotskyist Faction sought to es-

tablish the besi possible conditions for the mainterarca

vi unily sonowing ine congress. While it rcmairs in 0e

gaies that it would ac! as a resporsible minority in cou-

tinuing this policy in the coming period.

Following the congress. the Leninist-Trotskyist Faciion

held a two-day confcrence in shich there was a frse and

very educational discussion assessing the outcome and

what course to follow in the coming period. Ail of the

points I have louched on were raken up there.

Four decisions were made:

1. To try in the coming period to relax the factional

tensions that built up before the congress. Both sides

as a whole will welcome this, I think.

2. To give she majority an opportunity to make a far-

ther sest of its line. One can hope that this wüll not pro-

vide further ammunition for the minoriry when the dis-

cussion resumes, but a realistic assessment of ina: line in-

dicates that the minority will probably face an embarrass-

ment of riches.

3: In vlew of the nalure of the resolution on "armed

struggle" that was adopted, the ierinist-Trotskyist Fac-

tion will not dissolve but will continue lo function in a

disciplined, coordinated way.

4. The Leninist-Trotskyist Faction recognizes that the

unity of the fourth iniernational remains precarious de

cause of the possible consequences of the majority line

or: "armed siruggle."

was not as pictured in the SIT statement. According to

the information presented lo the Mandaies Commission,

a folal ol 5,277 comrades voted for the positions, of the

The rest of the menbers, which as a considerable num-

ber; either failed to vole or abstained because they were

not jet sure about the differences, or, in some sections

where supercentralist statutes are in force were denied the

right to vole because oi their status as "candidales" (their

membership being used nonchcless as part of the basis

for mandeles ai the congress).

It should be noted, too, that ine voles of youth groups

were not included in these laures. or even

As for the mandated votes at the congress, which pere

weighted in favor of the ISCMT because of the absien-

tions or restrictions, the vote was still only 137 to 125

with 7 abstentions and 1 nor voting on the IECHT reso-

lution on Argentina. In other words, the -IFCHT reso-

lution on Argentina received 50.5 percent of the voles.

one of the consequences being that the concessions "can

make the development of our movement more dillicult

in certain cases."

This contrasts with the position of the LTF, which we

thought was shared by the dil, that the nine points would

help maintain the unity of the Fourth International.

Nol once does the statument indicate that the organiza-

tional compromises were jointly reached in the interests

of the movement as a whole. it makes no mention what-

for the LCH-ETA(VI) and the GCl among others. The

IECMT leaders rejecied this formula for reasons they did

The representatives of the LTF voled against this anti-

Leninist procedure. As a consequence the three members

of the United Socretariut sclocted by the UTF to partici-

pale in the work of the Bureau, Hugo Bianco, Marcel,

and Johnson, were rejecied as not mecting MT' saccifica-

tions, and the MiT set up a Bureau consisting solely of

their own members.

Relerences to this turn of events are included in the finz

to paragrephs of the MT statement which was hands

1o the LTF the jolowing day. Summing up the ious wes

period following the world congress, the MT leaders ave

shat "the minority faction has refused-up to now -10

accept joint responsibility for the day-lo-day leadersbig

of the International."

They characterize this alleged refusal as reflecting *=

federalist concept of the International which conradies

the statutes and the line adopted by ine il'orld Conutess.

The MT -within four weeks! — is already suggestrg La!

the LTF is guilty of violating the stalutes and the line si
