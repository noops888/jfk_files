political covert action program, the Special Group

was told by Gordon Gray, Assistant to the President

for National Security:

NOTE:

Lumumba was assassinated on February 12, 1961.

Bissell allegedly contacted 0* Donnell about

assassinating Lumumba in the fall of 1960.

"Mr. Gray commented however, that his associates

had expressed extremely strong feelings on the

necessity for very straightforward action in this

situation, and he wondered whether the plans as

outlined would be sufficient to accomplish this."

A reading of the Special Group minutes in

context indicates that the phrase "Mr. Gray's a

associates" refers to the President. During

the Kennedy Administration, the phrase "higher ?

authority" was used in the Special Group minutes

to refer to the President.
