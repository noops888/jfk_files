coming wedding of BRUNO's daughter, JEANNE, BRUNO indicating

that both he and his wife disliked their prospective son-in-

law, RALPH PUPPO.

his plans for the future are not known

received,

stating that you could count on a relative giving

between $25.00 and $50.00 and from your friends you could

expect between $50.00 to $100.00.

Further, he said, that

he sorted all the envelopes bearing the money gifts,

arranged

them alphabetically by name of the giver, and listed the

amount each person gave on each envelope, commenting "You

have to consider this as a loan.". He concluded by saying.

according to the source, he first wanted to put the money

collected in a hatbox at the wedding reception; however, it

was too large to do this and he had to resort to using

an

to distribute to certain friends; FRANK NICOLETTI also hand-

carried several of them to deliver to selected friends; and

I-6 advised on August 1, 1962, that ANGELO BRUNO

to Atlantic City he did not desire to leave it in the house.

BRUNO Instructed TESTA to stop by the house and pick it up

MIKE at first indicated that he was making $10,000 to

$12,000 a week and BRUNO told him that this was not very

much because the take then would only come to one-half million

dollars a year.

After MIKE correoted his statement and

stated that he

was making actually $10,000 to $12,000 a

day, BRUNO commented that that would be a little, better

because it would come to about three million dollars a year.

BRUNO went on to tell MIKE and the informant that if he

went lato his numbers operation, he could pross 15 million

dollars a year:

BRUNO pointed out that just one of the

was contacted by one jIMMY, not further identified by I-?,

Philadelphia that might be able to help JIMMY but BRUNo was

sure, explaining that it has been fifteen years since he, himself,

has had anything to do with It and he is not sure what help he

could be.

JIMMY sald he appreciated the offer and inquired whether

'he himself could see the man but was told by BRUNO it would be

better if BRUNO handled the contact since the man was not

considering getting in touch with a couple of men he-met in

prison but BRUNO told him this was not advisable
