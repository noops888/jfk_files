Re Los Angeles letters dated 12/14/67 and

12/28/67, captioned LA 4960-PC, TECIP (Bufile. 137-

17525).

For the information of the Los Angeles

Office for use in subsequent contacts with LA 4960-

PC, It is to be noted that information furnished by

the informant with reference to Malia activities in

the Detroit area during the early 1900's appears to

be accurate and fits in closely with infrmation

developed by the Detroit Office in connection with

LCN investigations.

The brothers referred to by the informant

on page four of Los Angeles letter dated 12/14/67 are

undoubtedly identical with the GIANNOLA brothers, who

were notoriously known extortioners during the period

prior to the 1920's in Detroit.

All of them were

evidently killed in gangland wars.

Informant should be knowledgeable concerning

the RUGGIERELLO brothers who were active in Flint,

Michigan, during the 1920's and 1930's.

One of the

brothers

(both are deceased) named TODDO, was a close

personal friend of JOE ZERILLI, who is leader of the

Detroit LCN family and who rose to power during the

1920's.

4-1

TODDO RUGGIERELLO had four sons, two of

whom are still active in the numbers business in the

Flint, Michigan, area.
