OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

This report will cover the period 3u July 1965 through

15 September 1963 and is a follow-up report to reference A.

EFFORTS TO LEGALLY EXFILTRATE AMLEO-3 FAMILY FIQI CUBA

20.

developments occurred which effectively eliminated several alternate

solutions to the problem of the AlLEO-3 family in Cuba.

alternate solutions that were eliminated, as found in paragraph

3 of reference A, were (a) "Maintain Status Quo as a Family

attempting Leave

Cuba via Offices of Swiss Embassy as Part of the

American Repatriation Program"; (b) "Have AMLEO-3 Family

¡Withdraw Papers Fron the Swiss Embassy and American Repatriation

Program and Attempt Leave Cuba as Normal Refugees via Mexico

Or Spain": and (e) "Have the AMLEOS Family Case Taken up With the

GOC Through the 'Donovan' Channel for Possible Legal Exfiltration".

Elimination of the above alternates left only two solutions

that were at all feasible; (c) "Have the AlkO3 Family Take

Asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexcan Embassies in Havana",

"Have the AMLIO3 Family Exfiltrated black In a Maritime

Operation by either a RUBARK or Independent Maritime Team."

Because of the inherent risk involved in a black oxfiltration,

it was decided that the AMLEO3 family should be put into

asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexican embassies with all

possible speed.

In reply we can only state that audio?

was thoroughly briefed on the limitations of hia allas documentation

when said documentation was lagued to him.

He was told that the

credit card documents could never be used for identification or

credit purposes.

He had also been warned to avoid situations

whore he would be asked for positive identification, such as

renting a car, and by attempting to procure a rental car in

his actions, and again briefed on

the linitations of his allas

In order to strengthen his alias documentation

an I.D. card document Identifying him as an employeoeof "Charles

(Chester D. DAINOLD.

1n conversations with AMLEQ-3 In ZRuSTAl.

In regard to points a and b in paragraph 2 of reference C,

the KURIOT representative in WAVE Station states that the Florida

drivers license

issued to Joseph A. Reese is a valid, backstopped

drivers license for actual use by the Subject and the addrese

a legitimate uatehouse with backstopped rental cover.

Subject's

cover story was that he recently moved to the Miami area from

New Orleans, Louisiana (which city the Subjoct lived in for

several years and has relatives residing there). The Subjct's

documentation is therefore correct for hia cover story.

The

"pelling of "inatalment" on the National Credit Card was correctly

eppled from the

original document reproduced by KURIOT and we must

point out that "Instalment" is not only correct according to the

dictionaries but is the spellingiof the word which 1s now frequeutly

preferred.: (The Wall Street Journal Invariably prints the word

as "Instalnent" wIth one "I".) Tt would be appreciated 11

COSTS

16.

AMLBO3 continues to recelve a flat salary of five

hundred dollars ($500.00)

per month, and also is paid approxinately

one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for purchase of foodstuffs

since he is encouraged to eat his meals in the KUBARK

safehouse and stay out of public places.

to pay the wife of AlLEO-5 the amount of one hundred and twenty five

dollars ($125.00) per month for subsistance for herself and her

two children to supplement the $120.00 per month she receives

from the Cuban Refugee Center.

The C/O has continued his efforts

to find part-time employment

for Mrs: AMLEO-5 so that KUBARK

could be relleved of the necessity to aupport her, but to date

we have been unsuccessful in our efforte primarily because Mrs.

AMLEO-5 has never worked in her life and has no work skilla

whatsoever.

No other financial expenditures of note were made

the period, and no financial assistance 18 presently

contemplated for any other AMLEOS.

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

During the reporting period no positive Intelligence

reports were disseminated by the AMLEO group since none of the

active agents are located in the target area, nor do they

in Cuban exile circles.

We are continuing to utilize AMLEO-3 an & consultant

on the HAPRON program, and to this end are planning to have

hin expand his reporting of personality Information on selected

Individuals and to utilize him to explain interconnections

between various individuals and groups as they take shape

MHAPRON research.
