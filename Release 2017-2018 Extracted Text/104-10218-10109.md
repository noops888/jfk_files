•HEMMING:

In May, 1961. "Major" GEORGE TANNER formed an

anti-Communist brigade in Miani, Plorida.

This group

of about 40 men consisted of mercenaries and adventurero.

HEMMING later took over the group, operatod a military

training camp in the Plorida everglades. and changed the

name of the organization to Intercontinental Penetration

RE: GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, JR.

On July 2, 1961, HEMMING with abour five

mercenaries and Cuban exiles dressed in military uni-

forms, put on an air drop parachuting show for the

press at the airport at Davie, florida. HaMING and

his men were interviewed and he received considerable.

press publicity in south. Plorida bI being a person who

was recruiting sen to fight Communion in Latin America.

Also in July, 1961, HEMMING was contacting

different Cuban exile groups in Miani offering them

training camp facilities, and seeking *heir contributions

in dollar donations and weapons.

On August 24, 1961, HEMMING claimed he went to

Cuba and contacted representatives of the Cuban undor-

ground.

ANTONIO PEREZ QUESADA, Cuban exile boat captain,

on interview admitted he took HEMMING and six others to

Cuba on August 12, 1961 where they stayed about 42 hours.

However, neither HEMMING not his men made any contact

with the Cuban undergroune or militia.

On March 30, 1962, as a result of press publicity.

HEMMING decided to diswald other mercenaries and adventurers

from coning to Miami to join his organization. HEMMING

therefore sent out hundrado of form letters to persons

who previously made inquiry concerning joining INTERPEN.

• In March, 1962, most of the leading Cuban exile

organizations had disavowed any cooperation with HEMMING.

Most of the groups felt HEMMING was making a living at

the expense of the revolution and had no real intention

of taking his group to Cuba to üight against Communism.

In May, 1962, most of HEMMING's mercenaries

considered HEMMING completely unreliable in that he nad

taken no positive action and appearer to

be pore interested

Miami.

In August, 1962, HOMING planned a military

expedition to Cuba.

He obtained a boat and recruited

Cuban exiles, but at the last noment the exiled deserted

him, U. S. Customs agents searched the boat, and then the

boat broke down and became inoperative.

In Septenber, 1962, HEMMING opened a military

training camo at Big Pine Key, Plorida and had 14 of his

mercenaries training there.

The National Broadcasting Company, Time and

Life Corporation, and the Miani Herald Newspaper accepted

an invitation to visit the camp and photograph the

war games.

The National Broadcasting Company later used

these filas on a nationwido news program and claimed the

films were snuggled into the United States and were

photographs of actual internal revolution inoide of Cuba.

In November, 1962, HEMMING was working with a

private detective SAM BENION in Miani. HEMMING Was

supposed to sink pleasure boats so the owners. could

collect insurance.

The first boat he was to sink was

a 31 foot CrisCraft, however, HEMMING became frightened

and refused to sink the boat.

Therein, the business

enterprise between BENTON and HEMMING terminated.

Also in November, 1962, he obtained the use of

& 35 foot boat and planned

an expedition to Cuba.

HEMMING

threatened to shoot it out with the U. S. Border Patrol

and the U. S. Navy if they tried to stop him.

Problems

lator developed, the boat was not used, and the expedition

was called off.

In December, 1962, HEMMING rented a 35 foot

boat for an expedition to Cuba and planned to take 12

On December 4, 1962, U. S. Customs

agents arrested HEMMING and his group, confiscated the

arms, and arsunition on the boat and charged them with

conspiracy to export arms. On January 22, 1963, these

charges were dismissed.

donations, and ebtained amployment as a gardener.

In June,

maintained a large supply of arms at his residence.

HEMMING and his men pulled out gung, and threatened

ZARRAGA's life if he did not give them these arms.

ZARRAGA turned over these arus and REMMING left the

house momentarily.

While he was gone, U. S. Customs

agents arrived, confiscated the amus, and arrested

HEMMING's men.

In September, 1963, INTERPEN no longer existed.

HEMMING's followers lost interest and felt HEMMING would

never bo able to launch any military action ayainst Cuba.

The majority of the recruits left Miami, others were

run out of town by the police, an? others were arrested

for burglary, larceny, and vagrancy. During this period.

HEMMING visited leading Cuban exile

political figures

and a number of American right-wing conservatives for

donations. He travelled to Dallas, Texas, Chicago,

Illinois, and other places but was unable to raise

money •

On October 24, 1963, ALEXANDER I. RORKE, a free

lance photogragiri involved in Cuban revolutionary matters,

left on a flight for Central America.

He was never heard

It is noted that ROY EMORY HARGRAVES, an American

adventurer and mercenary, in July, 1970, advised he was

involved in a plan to effect warfare between the United

States and Cuba. The plan consisted of attempting to

have defecting Cuban military personnel fire missiles

against the United States Navy Base, Guantanamo, Cuba,

thus projecting the United States into a military take

aver of cuba.

HARGRAVES was closely associated in this

plan with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, another American mer-

cenary and adventurer and a long-time associate of

HARGRA VES •

MM T-l, an American citizen closely associated

with HARGRAVES

and HEMMING in the past ten years, on

September 15, 1970, advised that Mr. VINCENT OLLER,

detective, Dade County, Florida, Department of Public

Safety, Miami, stated that ha had been investigating

ROY EMORY HARGRAVES and GERALD PATRICK HEMMING inasmuch

as the United States Coast Guard in Miami had given him

some information concerning them.

MM I-1 said that OLLER indicated that HARGRAVES

"and HEIMING had devised sone illogical and irresponsible

military plan of action against Cuba which was highly

unlikely of any success whatever.

MM T-1 on November 13, 1970, advised that-

HARGRAVES recently moved his residence to a location

near Southwest 8th Street and themiami River, Miami,

and it was not known if he was at that time gainfully

employed.

MM T-l advised that HEMMING was then living

on Southwest 46th Street near 119th Avenue, Miami, ano

was unemployed.

HEMMING was scheduled for a job inter-

view with Butler Aviation Company, Miami International

Airport, but did not appear for the interview.

MM I-I said that although HARGRAVES and

HEMMING are now inactive in Cuban revolutionary

matters, they continually are devising irresponsible

military plans that will never be put into effect

because they lack the money, manpower, and necessary

military equipment.

MM T-2, another Government agency which

conducts intelligence investigations, on November 22,

1970, advised that agency had conducted investigation

into this matter and now thinks chances of HARGRAVES'

trying to promote such a plan are highly improbable.

MM T-2 stated that FARGRAVES and HEMMING are now

inactive but it is only a matter of time when they

will again devise sove illogical military plan to

be used against Cuba.
