1776-1976

RE: ASSASSINATION OF

JOHN F. KENNEDY

NOVEMBER 22, 1963

DALLAS, TEXAS

By letter dated October 20, 1978, the United States

Secret Service, Miami, Florida, furnished to the Federal Bureau

of Investigation (FBI), Miami,

a copy of a letter sent to

that agency

by the United States Drug Enforcement Administra-

tion (DEA), Miami, Florida, dated October 13, 1978.

The DEA

letter advised that an informant for DEA had indicated that

he was acquainted with Frank Sturgis of Watergate Notoriety,

and during a conversation Sturgis told the informant that he

had killed President John F. Kennedy. This remark was supposed

to have been made in the presence of an individual by the

name of Bill Johnson.

DEA advised that this informant could

be made available for interview.

On November 7, 1978, Peter F. Gruden, Inspector in

Charge, DEA, Miami, Florida, advised that the informant in

this matter was Thomas Joseph Holt. Gruden stated that Holt

was of questionable reliability, irrational, unpredictable,

and described him further as a murderer and perjurer.

He

advised that the only reason Holt was an informant for DEA

at this time was that Holt had furnished information of internal

nature. Gruden advised that David R. Wiser, Inspector, DEA,

Miami, could furnish more details concerning Holt..

On November 8, 1978, David R. Wiser advised that

Holt had come to DEA and had made allegations of wrongdoings

against a DEA Agent. Wiser advised that to date the internal

investigation in this DEA matter has not uncovered any evidence

to indicate any truth to the allegations of Holt. He advised

that the evidence to date indicates to the contrary.

Wiser advised that Holt had stated that during the late

summer 1978, he (Holt) was on Biscayne Boulevard in the downtown

Miami area, when he came upon Frank Sturgis, who was accompanied

by one Bill Johnson. Wiser advised that Holt stated that during

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of

the FBI.

It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your

agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed outside

your agency.

DALLAS, TEXAS

this encounter, Sturgis stated that he had killed John F.

Kennedy.

Wiser stated that he asked Holt "why would Sturgis

impart this interesting bit of news to Holt who was a

known government witness and publicized DEA informant from

the past?" And Holt replied that it was " one hit man to

another". Wiser advised that Holt had indicated an intention

to go to the news media regarding his allegations against the

DEA. Wiser further stated that he thought it likely that

Holt would also make mention of the Sturgis comment, in that

he had reported this to DEA, and that they had done nothing

about it.

Wiser advised for this very reason he wrote a memo

concerning what Holt had reported, and for this reason it was

furnished to the Secret Service.

Wiser made available a copy of this memo dated

October 4, 1978, which is attached.

Wiser further stated that in a case in which Holt was

a witness

for the prosecution Holt had allegedly called a

defendant during a trial and told him he was going to "get him".

The defendant in this matter, at the time of the call, had a

recording of his telephone call made which was played

for the

presiding judge.

Holt denied

making the call to the defendant,

and the

judge ruled that Holt's testimony could not be permit-

ted.

On November 9, 1978, Wiser had advised that Bill

Johnson was William J. Johson, date of birth March 11, 1931,

FBI number 133677C, last known address 1890 N.E. 118th Road,

Miami, Florida.

On November 31, 1978, Wiser advised that Holt had

been polygraphed on three occasions by DEA on November 30, 1978,

and he had failed the three polygraphs concerning his allegations

about DEA.
