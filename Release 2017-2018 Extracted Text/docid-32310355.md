RICHARD CHOPP, Small Business Administration (SBA),

Everett Dirksen Federal Building, advised the files of the

SBA show that the Chicago Automatic Machine Company had

received a loan and defaulted. GEORGE TARZIAN, 1742 Rosehill

Drive, Chicago, acting for Chicago Automatic Machine in May,

1974, obtained a loan of $250,000.00 from the Commercial

National Bank®

This loan was

guaranteed by SBA and defaulted

in May, 1976.

Assets. of Chicago Automatic Machine were sold.

The bill of sale was to the Herton Machine Works, 7326 North

Ridgeway Avenue, Skokie, Illinois, however, none of the

liabilities were assumed. IRWIN WEINER. was the person who

handled the negotiations and paid $40,000.00 for machinery

and equipment and $1,000.00 for assignment of patents.

$10,000.00 of this amount was paid in cash consisting of

$100 bills. An associate of WEINER who assisted in the

transaction was LARRY ROSS (True name LARRY ROSENBERG.) .

Chicago Automatic Machine is incorporated with

ROBERT ESTES as secretary-treasurer and attorney DAVID

FELDMAN as president.

GEORGE TARZIAN is acting as a consulting engineer

and, according to RICHARD CHOPP, without TARZIAN, Chicago

Automatic Machine would be nothing more than a machine shop.

He noted all his dealing was with IRWIN WEINER who is not

named in the corporation.
