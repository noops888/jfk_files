OF DOLLARS• SUPPOSEDLY, FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS COLLECTED AND GIVEN

TO ADELSTEIN. ADELSTEIN TOLD ANASTASIA HE GAVE THE MONEY TO PARISI AND •

ABOUT THAT TIME PARISI DIED. ANASTASIA DID NOT BELIEVE ADELSTEIN-S STORY

AND SENT INFORMANT TO GIVE ADELSTEIN A BEATING SO HE WOULD COME UP

WITH THE MONEY. INFORMANT GAVE ADELSTEIN A BEATING BUT ADELSTEIN STUCK

TO HIS STORY. ANASTASIA SENT INFORMANT TO GIVE ADELSTEIN A SECOND AND

THIRD BEATING. INFORMANT ADMINISTERED THE FIRST TWO BEATINGS, BUT DID

NOT ADMINISTER THE THIRD BEATING BECAUSE ABOUT THAT TIME SQUILLANTE AND

HIS CARTAGE BUSINESS BEGAN HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE AND THINGS
