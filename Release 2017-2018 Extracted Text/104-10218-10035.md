1. Identification

Mexico City, Mexico.

Support for singleton contract agent

operating into right-wing political milieu

in Mexico for

intelligence purposes with some covert action by-product.

2. Objectives

Objective

The objective of this project is to provide

support for a U.S. contract agent who has access to a wide variety

of right-wing political elements and organizations in Mexico.

b.

conduct of Project The contract agent, uhurts, was born

in Mexico and has had a long history of business experience in

Latin America, as well as, over the past fifteen vears. in Mexico.

At the present time, he is

which gives him a great deal of mobility

in both American and Mexican business circles.

Generally, it is

from the Mexican

business community that the financing and support

for right-wing political movements, organizations, and institutions

eminate.

Given the general trend of recent Mexican regimes,

as

well as

the present one,

toward more governmental

regulation and

manipulation of

the econonic life of

the country, the Mexican

businessmen continue to support right-wing political movements or

ostensibly nonprofit civic, research, and other types of organiza-

tions used by them as front instrumentalities for expounding

their philosophy and taking action in the politico-cconomic fields.

LIHUFF/1 has natural access through his present position and past

extensive experience in the business community here.

Over the

years,

as a matter of fact, his numerous associations with these

elements have earned him their trust and respect. In addition hurtle)

objectives of the RMD under certain circumstances where use

of right wing platforms and urganizations is merited.

3. Background.

a. Developments Leading! to Project.

(1) Mexico, politically, is a country in which, .

increasingly,

a centrist political concensus is developing

based on the

impact of education and economic development.

On either side though of this

growing central political

spectrum are extreme left and

extreme right wings which are

quite active and quite vocal and which have

an

influence in

the form of individuals,

organizations,

and movements greatly

out of

proportion to their numbers.

Political disturbances

and efforts to

induce lack of stability eminate in

the main

from these two extreme wings.

AS

the centrist force grows

5 lOWIY,

it is possible and probable. that these two wings will

intensify their efforts and become more and more radical.

The Station has intelligence coverage of the extreme left-

wing, but has neglected the equally. important extreme right-

in the final analysis, any threat to Mexican

wolftical stability by fomenting unrest and incidents does,

and

will continue

to, eminate

from

the right-wing as well

as

the left-wing.

Assuming that,

as indicated in the present

RMD, the long range national policy objectives of the U.s.

toward Mexico are to encourage a stable democratic government

and political environment, then coverage of the right-wing

is required if for no other reason than meeting

normal Station

responsibilities for political reporting.
