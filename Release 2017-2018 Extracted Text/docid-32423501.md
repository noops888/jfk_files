21 July 1975

Subject: CIA Intercession in Behalf of Robert Maheu and/or

Salvatore Giancana and/or John Roselli in Relation to

Possible Prosecutions Other than 1962 Las Vegas

Bugging Incident--Requested of Mr. Breckinridge

During Appearance Before SSC on 2 June.

Response:

A review of Agency files reveal one instance, in

addition to the 1962 intercession in connection with

the Las Vegas bugging incident, in which CIA

representatives approached law enforcement

authorities with reference to pending prosecution

against any of the above persons.

Records show that on 26 February 1971 the

Comnissioner, Inmigration and Naturalization Service,

separtment of Justice, was approached concerning

action reportedly being initiated for the

deportation of John Roselli. The purpose of this was

to forestall public disclosure of Roselli's past

operational association with CIA. It was agreed that

CIA would be kept informed of the progress of all

action. No further commitments were made.

17 July 1975

Subject:

SSC Request to Breckinridge During his 2 June Appearance,

for Files and Materials relating to the 1967 IG Report on

Assassinations, Including Tab A after Page 77 of the Report.

Response:

A search has been made for the files of the Chief, WH

Division in 1967 (Desmond Fitzgerald), and those of Col.

J. C. King. At that time Mr. Fitzgerald was alive; he

has since died and his files do not exist as an integral

collection, although portions may exist in different

holdings in WH Division. Col. King had retired at the

time of the IG inquiry, but he was still working under a

special contract and was at the Headquarters Building

at Langley where he had retained some personal files;

his files are no longer identifiable.

Other materials, reviewed by the Inspectors in 1967 were

limited in nature, some of which have been made available

to SSC Staff members in envelopes in which they have been

held since 196% The SSC Staff members have had access

to the project files of QJWIN, WIROGUE, ZRRIFLE and

EMDEED.

Should they wish

access to the files relating to the anti-Diem coup, they

can be made available on request.
