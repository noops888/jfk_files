CSDE 308-S, who has furnished reliable information

in the past, advised

SA J. RAYMOND COGILAN on May 26, 1961,

that he received no information indicating Subject's

present

whereabouts.

The Informant noted that JOHN ARTHUR SWEETMAN,

LOUIS HENRY JONES and LENNA SCHWEIZER JONES were not

personnally known to him. The Informant said he had received

no information

indicating any of these individuals or any other

members of the faculty or graduate student body of the University

of Michigan having requested teaching positions at universities

outside the United States. u.

The Informant added that the ónly LOUIS JONES

recently connected with the University of Michigan to his

knowledge was one LOUIS i. JONES who attended the University

of Michigan as a graduate student for the fall term of

1960-61 only.

JONES, according to the Informant, was the

announced "Co-Chairman of an organization formed in December,

1960, at the University of Michigan under the name "Committee

fôr improved Cuban-American Relations." The Informant said

that JONES claimed to have visited Cuba early during

1960,

presumably during the summer of 1960. His purpose in

organizing the Committee for Improved Cuban-American

Relations is announced as his intention to use this

organization as a vehicle for arranging low cost Christmas

tours to Cuba for students attending the University of Michigan.

appeared to follow the national program of the Fair Play for

Cuba organization which latter organization initiated the

"Holiday in Havana" student vacation tour for Christmas,

1960.

The Informant said that when the U. 'S. Department of

State issued an official caution to students on American

campuses participating in the Christmas holiday tour to Havana,

the purpose for the Comnittee for Improved Cuban-American

Relations at the University of Michigan was frustrated and

what limited student interest had existed in this tour

vanished. The Informant commented that the attempted

organizing of the Committee for Improved Cuban-American

Relations on the Michigan campus proved an aborted attempt

in view of the lack of student interest in the vacation

proposal and the

organization failed to become a functioning

campus group.

Informant said that to his knowledge JONES'

connection with the University of Michigan was

limited to

the one semester, fall of 1960.
