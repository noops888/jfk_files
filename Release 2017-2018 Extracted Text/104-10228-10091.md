VARONA was not familiar with the matter

and referred the query to DESFAIGNE. However. VARONA almo

informed Col. Johnson, who telephoned Air. Hurwlich on 15 June

and explained the background. Air. Hurwitch told Col. Johnson

that he was concerned that too much talk by Cubane might

jeopardise the U. S. Army progrars now under consideratlon."

3. In commenting on the reporte in the attached summary.

Col. Johnson stated that MIRC has deen urging the Cuban exlle

groups to encourage thelr men to calis: in the U. S. Army but

that the arguments reportedly vee in Paragrapha 1 and 4 of the

eltachmem are completely contrary to the Inatructions ho gave

MIRO. In MIRO's absence Col. Johnson diecuased this matter

-with VARONA, who denled that such arguments are being used.

VARONA stated that hia group (Movimiento de Rescate Constitu

clonal Democratico) had decided six monthe ago to analot la the

enforcement of the regiatration regulatione of the Selective

Service Syatem and t0 encourage la mambera to Join the U. S.
