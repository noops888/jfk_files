reviewed from the standpoint of value and usefulness with

a view

to determining whether the LILYRIc

without

materially affecting overall usefulness. *nI/OPS notes

that,

in the absence of further proof of uséfulness, the

CURRENT, OBJRCTIVES AND PRODUCTION RELATED THEREFO

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment. (in relation to project objectives.)

1.

"Io collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK. personnel

and physical facilities.

SCANTLING has continued to provide worthwhile in-

formation in support of this objective. (See previous project review forwarded

by HMMA-20052 of 18 October 1962.) During the past year SCANTLING was used to

follow up leads produced by both LIFEAT and LIENVOY in support of this objective..

In particular SCANTLING provided, in blueprint detail, casing reports on the

homes of two Soviet intelligence officers who are targets for Station technical

operations.

SCANTLING also is used to aid the Station in uaintaining current records

of the residences of Soviet personnel living in Mexiço.. This is accomplished by

SCANILING's FOllowup of LIENVOY leads which indicate Soviet interest in renting

specific properties.

2..

"To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of op-

portunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest

operating

in Mexico."

SCANILING has proved successful in providing information

on other Station targets:

2..

SCANTLING obtained infornation on AFMIQUELEI-2, a suspect Soviet

support asent which was the basis of further Station operations

against this target.

b.

SCANTLING provided a casing of the former Yugoslav Commercial

Office against which the Station had planned a technical operation.

However, this site was evacuated by the target mission before

plans were completed for this attempt.

c.

SCANTLING has conducted detailed investigations in various cases

involving possible agents. or contacts of hostile intelligence ser

vices. These cases were of prime concern to Station Mexico but

frequently were undertaken at the request of Headquarters or other

Stations.

30

"To provide support to other Station operations as ray be requested by

the Station officers concerned:

" In the past scabiNg's activites in this area

were

concerned primarily with recruitments, acbrietings and suurvatilances.. During

the reporting period, however, the weiglit: of SCANiLING's support to otherStation:*

operations have taken other forms.

Examples from this area of activity

include

the most fruitful efforts on SCAITLING'e part:

Support of the sensitive AMROD operation, in which Raymond I.

GERENDE also played a vital role, was of singular importance

to.

the success of the operation,

SCANTLING's many fields of op

erational experience were drawn on fully and he thereby provided

a unique contribution to the operation..

Without the assistance

of SCANTLING and GERINDE with their unique qualifications, this

operation would have been difficult in the extreme if indeed at

all possible.

In support of the Station's harassment campaign against Juan Jose

AREVALO Bermejo, launched at the request of Headquarters,

SCANILING again provided the means for carrying out a large portion

of the action taken. SCANTLING's efforts ranged fron the mailing

of "poisoned" candy to the target to the placing of threatening

phone calls.

SCANTLING also made calls to various Mexican news-

papers and mailed "montage" pictures of ARIVALO and a Soviet in-

telligence officer to Guatemalan newspapers in the campaign to

discredit and discourage AREVATO in the Guatemalan Presidential

C ..

SCANTLING is used as the alternate contactin a sensitive LAURICLE

This is for the purpose of minimizing the danger of the

action agent in this project being recognized as being in contact

with an obvious PBPRIME citizen.

SCANTLING's contribution to this

operation has been noteworthy both from the stanâpoint of security

and agent handling.

SCANTLING continued to conduct numerous pretext and neighborhood

Invostigations.

As in the past many of these investigations were

in relation to highly sensitive cases.

4.

Although SCANTLING'S LIEMPTY project objectives can not be completely

fulfilled, it

the Station's opinion that SCANTLING continues to meke valuable

conüributions to the objectives of the project and to other Station activities.

SCANTLIIG's production, measured against monetary empenditure, case officer time

and other intensibles feetors, unquestionably justifies his contiming as an

integral part, of Project LIENPIY.

Raymond Hi. OmIDE Segment (in ralation to project objectives):

2.

"To collect operational inforation and identify operational leads

pertaining to Station targets of opportunity."

The LIENTRAP operation,

handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective.

LIENIRAP operational emphasis continues to remain in the area

of photo stakeout

of prominent Mexican Communists and is presently vorking fulltime on providing

pictures of individual Conmunists, homes suspected of being meeting sites used

by the Cormunist Party and the Communist Party Headquarters itself.

LIENIRAP

has also recently. begun to be used on RINICK leads. It is expected that

activities of flENTRAP in that latter area will expand in the coming. year.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations including the

renting of hotel rooms and safe apartments, renting and servicing of post office

boxes, and conducting counter-survetllances." CERENDE's contribution to the

AMROD operation was noted in paragraph I.A.3.a. above.

GERENDE's comprehensive

area knowledge and personal operational capabilities enable him to make a

valuable contribution in such operations as AMROD and also enable him to procure

the mosi desireable safe sites in support of the Station's operations.

project's assets, particularly GERANDE and LIEMPIY-10, presently provide 20

post office box mail drops for use of Mexico City Station and other Stations.

Although it is plarned to reduce this nmoer considerably during the next year,

(since other Station assets now can provide a numoer of live accommodation

addresses, a number of post office boxes will be retained for use in îuture

operations.

4. The quality and quantity of oparational information produced by the

photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control and supervision

is considered by the Station worthwhile and in sone cases unique.

It is con-

cluded, therefore, that this segment of the LIMPIY Project should be continued.

C. Relationship to the Relaüed. Mission Directive

As notes in the

examples given abore, Project LIMPIY has provided valuable

support to many Station operations and thereby has been a contributing factor to

the fulfillment of the Related Mission objectives of the Station. The project

has not produced any positive intelligence nor is it intended to do so.

project's sole purpose is to provide a nechanism for the development of opera-

• tional incormation.

CHANCES

ordered by her doctors and an operation may be necessary in early 1964.

It is therefore unlikely that she will be able to work during the coming

project rear. Station does not plan to request cancellation of her operational

clearance at this time, but has not included salery payments to her in the

estimated costs of the project for the coming year.

The unusual salary increase reflected for LIEMPTY-19 in the "Project Costs"

(below) sectionfor the coming year is due to this agent's new duties of LIFEAT

processing in addition to her old duties as translator. Agent's OA was amended

for this use on 2 January 1963.

IIT.

EFFECTIVENESS

The corments made concerning the project's effectiveness in the Project

Renewal of 1960 (HMMA 15979) remain valid.

Indeed the Station's need for the

type of services provided by the assets of this project are at least as great

today as they were when those comments were originally forvarded.

IV.

PROBLEMS

There are presently no known major problems facing the operation which would

affect either the security or the effectiveness of this

operation.

the security

problem facing the LICATIA portion of the operation and described in HMMA-15979

and subsequent renewal requests has 'beeh resolved by the Cuban Government's release

of three KURIOT personnel earlier this year.

As was noted previously, one of

this group had inowledge of the LICATIA operation.

Both SCANILING and GERANDE took the LOFLUTTER during the month of October

1963.

No security problems were revealed by this test.

V. PLANS

The Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum size and

does not plan to expand it during the coming year.

Efforts will be continued to

refine ana better utilize the existing project organization and to improve the

compartmentasion and security of the projact.

Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the purpose of Project Renewal)

I. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1.

"To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities." SCANTLING has continued (see pre-

vious Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-17999, 31

October 1961, HMMA-14093, 13 November 1959, and HMMA- 15979, 18

November 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this. ob-

jective.

During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ex-

tensively to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY. An ex-

cellent example of this blending of various Station support assets was the

investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both

LIENVOY ard LIFEAT indicated the possibility of launching a successful

technical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIMERICK

intelligence officer assigned to Mexico under diplomatic cover. With the

aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed

by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station

support assets, were successful in installing a technical device in the

target.

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping

current records on the residences of the many Soviet personnel in Mexico

City. This is primarily accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of

all LIENVOY leads which indicate interest by Soviets in specific quarters.

(See previous project renewal requests for additional details.)

"To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence in-

terest operating: in Mexico": SCANTLING is very useful for collecting in-

formation on other Station targets:

On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installation in

Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an

operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural

machinery (ot U.S. origin) which was in transit to Cuba.

mount this operation, a precise and detailed casing ut the imple-

ment was essential.

This SCANTLING was able to accomplish in

one trip to Veracruz with resulis that contributed substangially to

the operation.

Excladed forg

b. SCANTLING provided the Station a detailed investigation

of Harotun ("Harry") KOPOLAN, employee of American Communists

Albert and Margaret MALTZ, which

determined the residence

of KOPOLAN as well as his family status and connections.

c. In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of

an otticial Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a projected

Station technical operation.

"To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances." SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both

directly and indirectly as noted in the following examples:

a. SCANTLING completed a detailed and secure interview of

the flancee of BESMOOTH to determine her connection with the

principals in the MCMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection

with procurement of documents used in the flight behind the Iron

This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING

was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an

admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the interview.

SCANTLING was called on for extensive initial spade work

in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation,

usual competent performance despite the fact that the role assigned

him was unique to his experience.

c. SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive

Station Soviet double agent which contributed significantly to that

operation.

d. SCANTLING was

used extensively during the visit of

GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort in providing maximum

protection for the GPIDEAL party.

a..

In addition, SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and

neighborhood investigations, some of which were highly sensitive.

SCANTLING also does most of the local investigations requested by

ODACID and other ODYOKE components.

4. In addition to his contribucions to the above objectives, SCANTLING

is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station.

For example,

SCANTLING handled LIEMBROIL-2 until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in July

1962. SCANTLING is also used io spot and rent sate houses and apartments

for other Station operations.

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,

although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be com-

pletely fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made

important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives

specifically and to other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's

production, measured against monetary expenditures, case officer time

and other intengible factors, unquestionably justifies his continuation

as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

"To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses."

Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute

to this objective.

To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual

description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute

to the above objective.

This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for

Project Renewal. (HMMA-15979)

"To collect operational information and identify operational

leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity. " The LIENTRAP operation,

handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective.

Among LIENTRAP's regular and extensive photographic assignments, was

the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have

never been photographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party

Headquarters. During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover

the recent move of PCM Headquarters (the first information Station had

of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site.

"To provide operational support to Station operations,

rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances.

GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other

Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area

knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an

extremely valuable Sation asset for such support activities. GERENDE

also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them.

4. The quality and quantity of operational information produced

by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE s control

and supervision is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique.

Station concludes, therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project

should be continued.

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in previous project renewals, it can readily be noted that

Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in

this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related

Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive intelligence

nor has it been intended that it should do so. The project's sole purpose

• is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information

in support of other Station operations.

IL. CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the

past project year affecting either objectives or personnel.

III. EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter

the validity of the remarks made in Section III of 1960 project renewal re-

quest (HMMA 15979)

IV. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation,

which was described in 1960 renewal request, is still present but has
