of CASTRO's entry

into Havana, Cuba.

This casino was insured for a sum of

$250,000.

The casino, #152 Offciof Street, Havana,

was founded

for an indefinite period by means of a Cuban public deed, dated.

August 6, 1957, and was registered in the Central Register, of

Stock Companies in Havana on Page 8460, File #25, of the 126th

This casino was insured under Policy No. 303,806-F

under the American International Insurance company, S.A.? Of

Cuba. Through negotiation, a final settlement was

payment for damages to this casino in the amount of $185,000.06,

with adjustment for debts, etc., resulting in a check being

issued in the

amount of $168,464.28.

The secretary of the Cuban corporation was a Cuban

attorney, Dr. EVERALDO SILVA. SANTANA. An agreement between

the

before-mentioned FRANK BURD and JOSEPH STASSI was such that

UBA

-the founders of the corporation were to establish the corporation

for the purpose of sub-leasing the gambling casino in the Plaza

Hotel, Havana, Cuba.

It was agreed that the Panamanian Corporation

would

have an authorized capital of 100 shares of common stock with

no par value, which were to be issued to the parties, their nominees,

or assigns.

From a confidential source it was ascertained that in

April 1960 ANGELO BRUNO claimed he had been able to recover most

of his investment in an undisclosed gambling casino in Cuba, but

had difficulty in removing the money from Cuba.

From an additional

source, BRUNO later stated that he had been able to get this money

out of Cuba and designated the sum he received as $180,000 for the

damage done to the gambling casino.

He indicated that he was

surprised that an unknown individual had refused to accept a

$20,000 offer for making this settlement even though the settlement

waS

made at a time, when the insurance premiums, had lapsed.
