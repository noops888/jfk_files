Dear Mr. Rhoads:

As it proceeds with its inquiry, the Senate Select Committee finds

that it would be extremely helpful to it to be able to review documents

in the Kennedy Library in Waltham, Massachusetts.

I have attached to this

letter a list of the materials in the Library which the Committee would

like to review. All are found in the Library's National Security Files.

Members of the Committee staff have been in touch with Messrs. Fenn and

Moss of the Library and with Dr. Reed and Mr. Jacobs of your staff.

Since the items in these files originated in various agencies--the

National Security Council staff, the Departments of State and Defense and

the Central Intelligence Agency--I understand that the Committee needs

clearances from those agencies.

Dr. Reed indicated to the Committee staff

that those clearances could best be obtained centrally, by your office.

The Committee requests your assistance in that regard.

The following Committee staff members should be cleared to review the

Kennedy Library materials. The security clearances each currently holds is

indicated.

Peter Fenn, TS/SI/TK/B

Karl R. Inderfurth, TS/SI/K/B

Alan Romberg, IS/SI/ TK/B

Gregory F. Treverton, TS/SI/TK/B

It would be helpful to us if the clearances could be obtained as soon

as possible. On behalf of the Committee, let me thank you for your assistance.

With best regards,

the think
