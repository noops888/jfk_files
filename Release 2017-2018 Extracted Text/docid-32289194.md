SUBJECT:

GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka.

SAMUEL MANNARINO; aka.

Remyairtel, 3/6/61.

on 3/8/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, as

follows:

Recently, one RALPH THOMAS, no other identifying information,

took about $2,000 worth of

knives, forks and other utensils, all

made of aluminum, to KELLY MANNARINO in Florida, reason unknown.

There were too many for MANNARINO. to use in his

i home in Surfside,

Fla., so KELLY must have a restaurant or other outlet there.

SAM MANNARINO recently visited Florida, and while he was there

he did not stop to see his brother, KELLY. This probably means

that they are still feuding.

On the same date, PG 612-C furnished SA FORSYTH with a copy of

an Empire Treasury Lottery Ticket, obtained 3/3/01, at City

News, 859 Third Ave.,

New Kensington, Pa., a numbers racket

outlet operated by TOM LATTOS and his wife, DONNA.

At that

time, informant stated these tickets are being distributed in

the New Kensington area by the "MANNARINO mob.
