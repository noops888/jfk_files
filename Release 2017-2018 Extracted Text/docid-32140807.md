According to information received on 3-5-64,Ktrom the /C

Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz (BfV - West German Federal Agency

for the Protection of

the Constitution] the November 29,

1963,

issue of "Deutsche National-Zeitung und

Soldaten-Zeitung" carried

the article furnished with re Bulet.&f)

the BIV can furnish no further information

regarding the origin of the information in that article.

pointed out, however,

that the same issue carried a rather lengthy

article reporting what, was described as a telephonic interview

with General Edwin A. Walker by a representative of the paper.

The report of

interview deals with Walker's comments on the

assassination of President Kennedy and does include several refer-

ences to Oswald and Ruby.

However according to the BfV th€

nterview does not contain anv information attributed to

Walker

which

would indicate that Oswald was the person who attempted to

shoot Walker.

+7.1a

The Brif Suggests the possibility that the article referred

to in relet, may have grown out of suggestions planted in the mind

of the reporter during the interview with Walker and may have been

the result of journalistic speculation on the part of the writer.
