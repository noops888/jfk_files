Coast Guard, Miami, indicating that on 4/12/66 JORGE GUTURREZ

ULLA (probably identical with JORGE GUITIERREZ), Chief of

Information for MIRR, stated that organization

is planning

two operations.

The first of these is the sabotage of a

ship belonging to some nation which continues to trade with

communist Cuba.

This act of sabotage will take place either

in Miami or Puerto Rico. GUITIERREZ indicated that JOSE

RODRIGUEZ PEREZ, who was arrested in Miami in connection

with the bombing of the Spanish motor vessel "Satrustegui"

would not participate in this

operation since the purpose

of this sabotage is to distract from the fact that RODRIGUEZ

PEREZ took part in the sabotaging of the "Satrustegul" (5-i)CET(4)
