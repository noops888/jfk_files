Photograph of

to E. Henry Knoche,

1.

In accordance with reference request, we have examined

and summarized the record concerning a cropped photograph that vas

considered by the Warren Commission in the course of its investi-

gation.

The photograph (together with others of the same

individual) originated from an intelligence operation conducted

in October 1963 by the CIA

2.

Under the extraordinary press of effort to develop infor-

mation on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the phota-

graph were made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on the

afternoon of 22 November to the local FBI representative. Later

that day, assertedly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies

were conveyed by an FBI representative on a special U. S. Naval

Attache flight to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use

in the ongoing investigation. One photograph, cropped by the

FBI, was shown to Mrs. Marguerite Ostia

(Lee Harvey OSWALD'S

mother) in Dallas on the evening

ber 1963 by an FBI

agent.

stay in Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the

morning of 2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the

unidentified man originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is

important; therefore, to an understanding of the acquisition and

handling of the photographs by the Mexico Station to review what.

the Station ascertained and did with the information it developed

about OSWALD in Mexico City, together with Headquarters action on

that information.

5: From all credible evidence known to this time (none,

incidentally, added since the exhaustive work of the Warren Com-

mission), Lee Harvey OSWALD spent fours

registered under alias.

Exhaystive and detailed interviews and

interrogation by the Mexican authorities and the FBI after the

assassination established that, in the recollection of all hotel

personnel, he left and returned late each day of his stay.

6. Allowing for the fact of late arrival and early departure,

and assuming that he slept one-third of the time of his stay

(38 or 39 hours), there remain some 78 hours of activity to be

coverage by CIA during the

Station had no live sour

7. It should be noted that

OSWALD was in no sense "under

investigation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in

the USSR and return to the U. S., 1959 - 1962, were known to the

Mexico. Station or in its files before 10 October 1963. On that

date, the bare bones of his biography were forwarded by. Head-

quarters in response to a Station cabled report of 8 October

which had forwarded, on a routine basis, what appeared to be a

contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR.

This was indicated and deduced from technically acquired infor-

mation on 1 October, which was the first and only occasion on that

visit in which OSWALD was recorded as identifying himself

(partially) by true name.

8.. At no time during his

acquire a photo of OSWALD.

This confirmed that there was no

CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his

Mexico trip

or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a cabled

request on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD

in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters - which

did not have.one either.-- before 22 November 1963.

9. It must be stressed that

chnical information the

Station had was not (and normally

volume of the infor-

mation preclude anything

reporting of items judged

to be of more than ordinary int

est

and, therefore, noted in

summary logs. Full texts of selected items require consultation

of the tape and either a full transcription or full translation

or both.

Photo coverage tends to become available in quantity

lots

which requires scanning and selection on a rapid and

accelerated basis in four or five day "peaks." One of the

"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more

speedy review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is

the mention of a name. This was precisely what occurred in the

second of two conversations on 1. October, during which the

speaker said he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information

reported by the Station to Headquarters in its first indication

on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

10. The Mexico Station did one

report on Lee OSWALD based on

of a male individual,

apparently an American, who w

observed entering an Embassy

on I October. The Station reported this detail on the 8th as

a matter of coincident fact. The Station did not assert or

suggest that the data led to any deduction that the photo was in

fact OSWALD of, indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.

additional element of backu

to

understanding the

on 23 November in

Dallas by the FBI agent:

wha

totality of CIA Mexico's

coverage of OSWALD's activity as of

the afternoon of the 23rd

when all available coverage had been checked?

12. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD consisted of five (5) voice intercepts.

Each of these items, including the text of the raw intercepts,

were read by, discussed with, and examined by Warren Commission

staffers, in Headquarters and at the Mexico Station during a stay

Fron 8-13 April 1964. All were made available promptly to

the FBI.

13. At about mid-day. on I October, the camera registered

the entry into an Embassy of a white-shirted individual.

In the

opinion of the Station, among all the persons photographed that

day, he appeared to be the only non-

and possibly American

who entered. On the chance that

14. The Station's action was not unusual and really amounted

to an analytic "quantum leap," in terms of the primitive status

of the OSWALD identification. Many examples of a similar kind of

thing can be found in the day-to-day record of Station-Headquarters

• 15. On 22 November 1963 the Mexico Station cabled Head-

quarters at 22292 time after learning of

arrest of Lee H.

OSWILD, age 24, possibly in connection

the assassination,

and referenced its carlier messagest of

Headquarters' repty of I0 octobal

could be identical with OSWALD."

I6. This obviously was for comparison at the Station

• which had estimated the age of the unidentified male whose

photograph it had selected as having the "apparent age of 35."

17. The Station meanwhile had begun an exhaustive and

accelerated review of all its technical and

photographic intel-

ligence. A dispatch was prepared in accordance with the

indication given in the cable of 22 November. The dispatch

noted that photo coverage of the unidentified individual had

turned up on 4 and 15 October. The text

of the 22 November 1963

pouched dispatch read:
