WFO 92-733

WASMAN, JACK LASOMAN, WASHERMAN, WATSERMAN, etc., as

appear in the person

to person toll call records, are

apparently phonetic spellings for JACK WASSERMAN since

all numbers are listed to him.

WFO indices contain no references to DONN S. MITCHELI.

A call to 223-2858 revealed that this number was disconnected;

however;

his residence number in Alexandria, Virginia, is

still active.
