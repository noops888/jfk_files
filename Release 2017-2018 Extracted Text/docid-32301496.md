Organization in Rockford for illegal purposes he would

assume that it is a reiatively small organization be-

cause hedoes not believe there is enough going on in

Rockford to support a large group.

On September 2, 1964, Detective Sergeant

ROBERT SELGREN advised SA RIGGS that he had heard

that CALO had returned to Rockford to get PHILLIP EMOR-

DENO (Chicago File 92-1714) back into line. Sergeant

SELGREN said that this seemed very unlikely. He said

that he could not imagine that it would be necessary to

have CALO return all the way from Sicily just to accom-

plish this.

An information copy of this communication is

being furnished New York and Springfield in order to

clarify the information set out in referenced Milwaukee

teletype.
