DN T-1 reported on February 3, 1964, that he observed

an advertisement in one of the Denver newspapers and correspon

ded with DE PUGH indicating his interest in MM. T-l reported

that he began receiving publications and literature from the MM.

T-l' advised that some time in 1962, DE PUGH contacted

him telephonically and urged him to assist in setting up a meet-

ing in Englewood, Colorado: DE PUGH also invited T-1 to visit

the MM headquarters near Kansas City.

T-1 reports that he still receives, through the mail,

literature distributed by the MM but has never attended any meet-

ings of the MM in Denver or anywhere else in the United States.

I-l advised that dues to the MM are $4.00 per year; however,

DE PUGH has made requests for contributions for various causes

during the period 1962 and 1963..

HAROLD C. TAYLOR, 2513 South Quitman Street, Denver,

advised on February 3, 1964, that in August or September, 1961,

he corresponded with DE PUGH as a result of reading an advertise-

ment in a local newspaper. He stated that the advertisement had

to do with securing a catalog on guns. TAYLOR stated he was

interested in collecting guns and had no interest in any political

activities of the MM. TAYLOR stated he did not secure from

DE PUCH any guns of any type and, after receiving some literature

from MM, he decided to disassociate himself with the organization

and wrote a letter to DE PUCH requesting that his name be removed

from DE PUGH's mailing list. TAYLOR stated he recalls receiving

a letter from DE PUGH right after he joined MM to help organize

a group in Denver but because of his disinterest in the aims of

the MM he did not make any effort for such an organization and

did not attend any meetings whatsoever held in Denver or anywhere

else in the United States.
