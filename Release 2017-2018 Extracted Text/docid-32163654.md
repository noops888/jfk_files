TEAMSTERS President JIMMY HOFFA instructed La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

bosses to kill President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963. Based upon

source's past relationship with both HOFFA and RAGANO, source

categorized RAGANO's claims as "lies". f) (U)

Source advised source's relationship with HOFFA began

in the late 1950s while HOFFA was a Vice President of the

TEAMSTERS. Source's relationship with HOFFA lasted until HOFFA's

disappearance. Source described the relationship between

and HOFFA as

"close" noting that source was one of HOFFA's few

associates who could meet with or call HOFFA at any time without

an appointment.

Source stated HOFFA offered source a position as

one of HOFFA'S trusted assistants which source respectfully

declined.

regard to RAGANO, [Source recalled attending only

three or

four meetings with HOFFA and others in the early 1960s

which were also attended by RAGANO.

Although source has not had

contact with RAGANO for many years,

source recalled RAGANO (like

most people attempting to contact HOFFA) was required to make an

appointment to see HOFFA in the early 1960s. Source was not aware

if RAGANO'S status with HOFFA changed in later years.

as EDDIE
