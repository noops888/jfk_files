RACIAL MATTER

On April 1, 1968, a confidential sour ce advised

he understood that following the racial disturbance which

Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) called a meeting of several

SCLC Executive officers which was held March 30, 1968, at

the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta. Among those attending

this meeting were James Bevel,

SCLC Executive Staff member;

Jesse Jackson, Northern Director, Project Breadbasket, SCLC;

nosea Williams, Director of Voter Registration and Political

Education, SCIC; and Stanley Levison.

Reverend King arranged this meeting for the purpose:

of reviewing the recent disturbance in Memphis and evaluating

the effect thereof upon SCLe's contemplated Washington Spring

Project (WSP).

Reverend King opened this meeting by again

the effect of the Memphis

disturbance on his image as a

civil

rights leader and the position of SCLC as a leading civil rights

organization. This entire matter apparently upset Reverend King

to the extent he found it desirable to excuse himself from this

meeting shortly after its commencement.

Source was unable to

advise whether Reverend King returned to the meeting.

This meeting lasted most of the day and concluded with

a decision on the part of those present that SCLC officials would

innediately return to Memphis, re-organize the striking Sanitation

Dis should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organization

Martin Luther King, Jr.

Security Matter - C

A confidential source,

who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on March 29, 1960, that on that

aate, stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr. discussed

the position which King has found himself in as a result of the

violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1968,

at the time wher King led a march

• through downtown Memphis. King

told Levison that he feels they have to face the fact thats

from a public relations

point of view and every other way,

are in serious trouble"

He referred to the Washington D.C.

Spring campaign, known as the Poor People's Campaign, and

• aS

far as it is concerned it is in trouble. King noted that it

will be much more difficult to recruit people for the Washington

campaign now because they (the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference) (SCLC) are recruiting non-violent people and these

people will hold back if they think they will be in a campaign

that is going to be taken over by violent elements.

King stated

that this is not a failure for the SCLC because it

has enough

of a program to affirm its position but that it is a personal

setback for himself.

King continued that persons such as Roy Wilkens

(Head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored

People) and Adam Clayton Powell, and Negroes who are influencec

by the press, will now feel that he, King, is finished, that his

non-violence

is notning, that no one is listening to it. King

reiterated that they have had a great public relations setback as

far as his image and leadership are concerned.

Martin Luther King, Jr.

Levison attempted to dissuade King from this point

of view stating that it would be true only if King accepts "their"

definition. He added that ha felt it is a profound error king.

is making..

King noted that he did not accept it himself but that

others will.

Levison retorted that people would accept it for

a: few days, but, if events prove otherwise, will not accept it.

King noted that events will not prove otherwise unless

they think soberly through this period.

He said that somehow he had

to reaffirm what

the press will

refuse

to affirm. He referred to

the Memphis incident stating that they all know it was just a

few people who were involved.

added that it was a failure

of the leadership in Memphis.

King informed Levison that persons

who were responsible for the violence came to see him on the

morning

He said these persons were fighting the

Leadership in Memphis, the men who ignored and neglected them, the

men who would not give them any attention, who ordered their

telephones cut off.

King added that he had no knowledge of all this,

that the

persons responsible for the violence were too sick to see

that what they were doing during the violence was hurting him, king,

nore than it could hurt the local preachers.

King related that he was so upset and shooked over.

Memphis violence that he was going to announce a personal fasi

as a means of appealing to the Memphis leadership, as well as

•se

who participated in the violence, to come to him in a united

front to take up the "cudget" and get on with the movement:

He said he felt this kind of spiritual move would be a way or

unifying the movément, of transiorming a minus into a plus.

added that he feels their Washington campaign is doomed.

Levison attempted to convince King that his reasonir

was not correct.

Levison said he was concerned over the "trop

King was placing non-violence in because King was saying that

he must have 100% adherence to non-violence which is an impossibility

jump out, do something, and then come back to hide within

the group.

King said he is a symbol of non-violence and

that the press is not going to say what Levison said.

He

said the symbol will be weakened and it will put many Negroes

in doubt.

He said he must do something that is a powerful

act to unify forces and refute the press.

Levison stated that if it had this result he would

agree but that he is bothered by the idea that king would be

accepting the logic of the press. that if King can control 99%,

and not the 1% who are violent, he is a failure. He said they

must find & way in which they do not accept this otherwise King

will never be able to do anything unless he always spiritually

reaches a level where he hypnotizes every Negro alive.

King questioned how he could say that they can

control the planned demonstrations in Washington, D.C. and at the

same time conclude they are going to have 1% violence.

Levison counseled that King can say that he can control

his followers and is not undertaking to control everybody else.

He said King could take the position that his followers are non-

violent and will do what they must do.

They agreed to discuss the matter in depthat a meeting

• In Atlanta, Georgia in King's church office on the morning of

March 30, 1968.

The same source advised on March 31, 1960, that on

that date Stanley Levison commented on the meeting held in Atlanta,

Georgia, on March 30, 1963. Levison's comments included the

following:

At the Atlanta meeting they examined the whole Memphis

incident and came up with a new approach.

"We are going

• back to

Memphis.

We are going to prove that you can have mass action

in the streets"

Martin Luther King had decided not to go

oack to memphis and not to go to washington (for the poor People':

campaign,. It was the determination of the (SCLC) staff that

SECRET

Martin Luther King, J:

changed King's thinking.

King is going back to Memphis

on Tuesday (April 2.

1968) and there will be a big march on

Friday (fpril 5, 1968). The Memphis incident was caused by

"a handful of kids" and it could have been controlled by "our

guys" (the SCLC) had they been there,

He, Levison, made the point that they could not let

"a couple of

kids" keep

"mass action" from being their weapon.

As for controlling the Washington, D.C. demonstrations,

King knows he can control the youth. What has to be done is

go to the high schools and tell them what the establishment

wants them to do. Once they grasp this there is no chance

of

anything happening.

What they (the SCLC) are afraid of in

Washington is a double cross from Stokley Carmichael and the

answer to that is that "our job" (the SCIO) is

not to stop violence

but to be non-violent themselves.

"Our position" is that. "we"

are going to go on because to be able to march inthe streets is

"our most important tool" and are not going on the streets because

It may start violence.

"Why do we have to be afraid of riots'

It is their problem not ours"

The Atlanta meeting was good because it shows how

much militancy there is in the SCLC.

A confidential source, who has furnished

in April, 1904, that Stanley Levison was

March 29, 1968

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

SECURITY MATTER - C

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER

On March 28, 1968, a confidential source advised that

during the morning of

that

296 date

date Reverend Martin Iuther King,

II., President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),

participated in a march in Memphis, Tennessee, conducted by

sanitation workers who are currently on strike in that community.

During this march, incidents of violence were engaged in by a

relatively small group of Negroes.

With reference to the above incidents, it was the

opinion on March 28, 1968, of Reverend King, Ralph D. Abernathy,

Vice President and Treasurer, SCLC; Bernard

Lee, Special Aide.

to the President, SCIC; and Hosea Williams, Director of Voter

Registration and Political Education,

SCIC,

that

those responsible

therefor were in no way connected with SCLC but rather represented

a minority who obviously are neither in sympathy with Reverend

King nor SCLC. Reverend King and his colleagues did not know

the

identities of these individuals but suspected they might possibly

be connected with sone "black power" organization.

Because of the disturbance in Memphis on March 28, 1968;

Reverend King became extremely dejected and discouraged as to the

prospects for success of SCIC's contemplated Washington Spring

Project (WSP).

Reverend King told his colleagues on this

date

that because of his participation in the Memphis march, the

disturbance which developed, and the ensuing publicity he was

gravely fearful that his image and that of SCLe as advocates of

nonviolence will be blemished.

This document contains neither recommendatiors nor conclusions

Martin Luther King,

Jr.

Security Matter - (

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on March 20, 1960, that,

late on that date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, JI.

discussed the violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee

on March

20, 1960, following King's leadership

of a protest -

march through downtown Memphis. King indicated that he has

become so depressed over the developments in Memphis that

he has considered calling off the Washington March (his

self-described Poor People's Campaign, scheduled to begin in

Washington, D.C. on April 22, 1968).

Levison told King that his depression was aggravated

because he is physically exhausted as a result of his recent

strenuous program.

He counseled King not to be on the defensive

over the events in Memphis but, on the contrary, should take

the position that the majority of people in the Memphis March

did not join in the rioting that took place, proving the

effectiveness of King's leadership and his policy of non-violence.

Levison emphasized that the Washington March will be different

in that King will have organized this march and his forces can

stress the importance of non-violence.

Levison suggested that

Saturday morning (March 30, 1968) would be a better time to

meet in Atlanta to discuss

the Memphis incident rather than

meeting on Friday night (March 29, 1968) because it will give

King time to rest.

Martin Luther King, Jr.

King agreed in every respect with Levison's

evaluation.

The source also ascertained that, prior to conferring

with king, Levison spoke with

• the Reverend

Ralph Abernathy,

an aide of Dr. King's, who advised Levison that King has

cancelled a scheduled

appearance in Washington, D.C. on

March 29, 1968.

Abernathy also noted that King is scheduled

to be in Virginia on Saturday (March 30, 1968) but will

probably cancel that appearance.

Abernathy continued that

it was a mistake for the King forces not to have a staff in

Memphis to train people in non-violence. He said it also was

a mistake on the part of the King forces not to have been

more aware of the local situation.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

On March 22, 1968, a source advised that a

representative of the

Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC), Atlanta, Georgia, had made reservations

for nine single rooms for

the night

of March 22, 1968 at

the Holiday Inn, Savannah, Georgia.

On the same date, the "Savannah (Georgia) Morning

News"

, a daily newspaper, announced that Rev. Martin Luther

President of the sche,

was scheduled to speak

that

night at 7:30 p.m. at the St. Paul C.M.B, Church,

Savannah, Georgia, about the planned "Poor People's Campaign".

On March 23, 1968, a second source advised that

Rev. King failed to appear the previous evening at Savannah

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to our memorandum dated March 19,

1968, and captioned as above, which sets forth information

concerning progress in the organization and planning of the

Washington Spring Project (WSP).

Martin Luther King, Ji., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced

he will conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign in the

Nation's Capitol during April, 1968, in an effort to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

In pursuit of this project, the SCLC has opened an

office in Washington, D. C., from which to organize and direct

the WSP.

On March 22, 1968, a press conférence was called by

WSP representatives at the SCLC Office, Washington, D. C. (WDC).

At the conference an announcement was made that King was expected

• to be in WDC on April 22, 1968, to initiate the WSP by presenting

his requests to Congress. They further announced that late in

April or early May, 1968, they expect three thousand demonstrators

• to arrive.

The emphasis is being placed on the length of the

demonstration rather than the number of demonstrators and they

do not expect the number of demonstrators to exceed five

thousand and will possibly limit the number to that figure. They

expect the demonstrators to remain in WDC as long as necessary or

until they get tired and return to their homes.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

CONFIDENTIAL

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised on March 23, 1968, that he had

learned that a meeting had been held on the morning of March 23,

1968, of heads and representatives of various committees

established to organize and plan the WSP. There were approxi-

mately twenty-five people there, including Reverend Walter E

Fauntroy, Vice-Chairman of the Washington City Council, and

a WDC affiliate of the SCLC....

The chairman of the Food Committee reported that

the Cooks Union had offered their services to the WSP. She

further advised that all food handlers would be screened and

examined.

A representative of the Xaverian College, 10000

New Hampshire Avenue, White Oak, Maryland, met with the group

and advised the college could handle six hundred people at one

time. The source did not know if this had reference to handling

six hundred people as residents or feeding that number at one

time.

No site has been located on which to erect the "New

City" to house the demonstrators. Three sources from which land

can be obtained were discussed.

They were:

District of Columbia land;

Federal Government land;

Land belonging to churches and private individuals.

Reverend Fauntroy suggested that Billy (simpson,

3815 Gaorgia Avenue, N.W., be named to head the fund raising

committee and that one Flaxie Pinkert be asked to assist.

A second confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised on March 25, 1968,

The racial situation is very uncertain. People

are apprehensive about Dr. Martin Luther King's "poor

people in WDC are not in sympathy with Dr. King's demonst-

ration plans. WDC leaders are attempting to evaluate the

potential of

Dr. King's impact on WDC, in April. Howard

University students began a sit-in at Howard University on

March 19, 1968, protesting possible disciplinary actions

against students involved in previous disruptive action

on the campus.

III. CURRENT EVALUATION OF VIOLENCE POTENTIAL

Source number one who lives in the Northeast and

works in the Northwest sections of WDC, advised as follows

on March 11, 1968:

The racial situation in WDC appears to be very.

uncertain. Nobody knows what is going to happen in WDC

and many people are scared.

They are not sure what will

happen when Dr. Martin Luther King's "poor people's campaign"

begins in April. Even though Dr. King has asked the

militants to stay out of the activities, there is no

assurance the request will be honored.

The March I1, 1968, issue of the "Newsweek"

magazine, page 45 contained a paragraph captioned "Washington".

It stated Washington had never been considered to be a

major racial tinderbox as much of its Negro population works

¡or the federal government and is insulated by civil service

security from the worst chills of black despair.

Washington was facing the summer with nervous uncertainty,

.2nd DI. King was bringing 3000 demonstrators to Washington

to begin a summer-long campaign of picketing and marching

Ior jobs and income..

The March 12, 1968 issue of "The Evening Star",

a daily WDC newspaper, page B-1 reported that District

• Safety Director Patrick V. Murphy had said the Washington

police hoped to train as many as 2,800 volunteers for

emergency duty this summer in an enlarged "Police Reserver

Most of them would be used for station duty and

thus free additional policemen during emergencies.

The March 12, 1968 issue of "Washington Afro-American",

a Washington, D. C. newspaper, page 12, reported that The

National Advisory Commission

• on Civil Disorders had said

that "Abrasive relationships between police and non-whites

have been a major source of rioting in the racial ghettos

of American cities'.

On March 14, 1968, source number two who works

in the ghettos of WDC and is acquainted with many of the

under privileged advised as follows:

The "poor people's campaign" which is a demonstra-

tion being planned by Dr. Nartin Luther King, Jr. has been

given the support of a number of the larger religious groups

IN WDC.

The demonstration will show the underprivileged

that much effort is being expended in efforts to 'improve

their life. It is believed the demonstration will be

beneficial. Plans are being made to have volunteers from

among the demonstrators, who will agree to be arrested if

necessary. It is not believed that any racial trouble will

result from the demonstration.

Source number two further advised as follows:

Stokely Carmichael is in Vashington, D. C. and has

organized the Black United Front, (BUF), but it is not

believed that Carmichael will have much

support from BUF

members if Carmichael decides to create violence in WDC.

majority of the BUT members are not expected to support

any plans for racial violence.

On March 14, 1968, source number three who resides

in the Northwest section of

HDC advised as follows:

It is his belief that a riot could take place in

HDC over some unexpected incident such as the arrest of a Negro.

This has happened in the past in other large cities.

Other

than the above situation, the conditions are such that the

source is optimistic about a riot-free summer in WDC.

Source number four who resides and works in the

ghetto areas of Northwest WDC, advised as follows on

March 18, 1968:

On March 17, 1968, Stokely Carmichael gave a talk

at The Church of The Redeemer, 15th and Girard Streets,

N. E., WDC at the invitation of the Fellowship Forum of the

church. Among other things, Carmichael said the black people

in the United States must connect with the 900 million black

people of the "third world" to liberate themselves from the

control of the white man. He described the "third world" as

including the black people of Cuba, West Indies, Haiti,

South America and Africa. He said

the United States is

planning genocide against the Negroes and for this reason

Negroes should arm themselves.

He said he did not mean a

.22. caliber either. He advocated that every black man in the

United States get a gun. He stated that if Negroes obtained

an arsenal, relations between whites and blacks would be equal.

Source number four further stated as follows:

Carmichael said he realized many black

people do not agree with his idelogy, and that there are many

"Uncle Toms" in the community.

Carmichael said his group

proposes that if they develop information about a person

"being that way", someone will talk to that person and

aitempt to change his mind and "if he does not change his

ways, he will be considered a traitor to his community and all

traitors die". Carmichael said black people should support

the Arabs in any conflict between the Arabs and the Israelis.

'He said the WDC Public School System is 93% Negro and the

curriculum must be changed to be more relative to the Negro

community.

The March 18, 1968, issue of "The Washington

spoken to a racially mixed audience

on March 17, 1968 at The Church of The Redeemer, WDC.

Among

Carmichael's comments to the group were "Ve are advocating

simply that every black man in this country should get a

gun.

The only reason the honkie (white man) is able to rule

is because he has a gua".

The March 18, 1968 issue of "The Evening Star",

a daily WDC newspaper on page B-3, reported that the District

chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of

Colored People had voted to support the goals of the Reverend

Dr. Martin Luther King's "Poor People's Campaign".

Source number five who lives and works in the

Northwest section of WDC, on March 18, 1968, advised as

follows:

It is believed there are some individuals in WDC

who may be inclined toward the creation of racial trouble

in WDC, but these are not likely to initiate any actions

toward

the starting of trouble.

The feeling among many in the

Northwest ghetto is that in order for the "poor people's

campaign" to be successful, Dr. Martin Luther King,

Jr.

will have to bring in outsiders for his reported "civil

disobedience" in WDC. In the event large numbers of outsiders

are brought in, their behavior will be very difficult to

control. Therefore anything may happen.

Source number one further advised as follows on

'March 18, 1968:

In the Northeast area

near the source's residence,

there has been a lack of enthusiasm by the WDC citizens for

Ir. King's "poor peoples campaign". These people are not in

sympathy with Dr. King's plans as they fail to see that any

benefits may result from any demonstration involving civil

•disobedience.

Source number six who resides in Northwest WDC

and is employed in a Northwest ghetto area, advised as

£ollows on March 18, 1968:

The foremost concern of people in WDC is the unknown

potential for racial trouble which could take place when Dr.

Martin Luther King and his "poor people's campaign" begins

in WDC in April 1968.

Many leaders of organizations in WDC

are attempting to evaluate the current and future potential

Of Dr. King's impact on the racial scene of WDC. These

leadeis are very concerned and are trying to determine what

response VDC citizens may give Di. King.

On March 19, 1968 at about 1:30 PM about fifty to

seventy-five students

began a sit-in in the lobby of the

about 4:45 PM, on March 19, 1968, approximately one hundred

and fifty students were engaging

in a sit-in in the Adminis-

According to Sergeant Vaughn, Stokely Carmichael

appeared brielly at the building, but did not participate in

the sit-in and then departed.

THEFTS OF GUNS AND AMMUNITION

Source number eight who is employed in the North-

west section of WDC, on March 18 and 19, 1968 advised as

, follows:

The source has received at least 50 or more handguns

of various types including automatic pistols, snub-nosed

weapons and weapons with a long barrel, from an individual

employed in WDC.

The guns have been obtained from the Fall -

of 1967 to the present time.

These were stolen guns.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

on March 19, 1905, that on that

date Stanley Levison contacted Harry Wachtel.

Levison, referrine

to Martin Luther King's Washington, D.C. spring campaign,

Wachtel that the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy

a generalized resolution on the (Vietnam) war and

specifically endorsed the Washington campaign.

He added that

Tudja Crowder, whom he described as the new Executive Director

of sane, had contacted him and wanted to nave a meeting on march 20,

1900, with a small group of the Sane Directors to have them

briefed by someone from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) to see how they can tie in.

Levison felt this was

• important

and said that, if there is an element of the peace movement they

might get to join "this" (the Washington Project), it will be

Sane.

Levisonalso mentioned that the Washington Jewish

Community Council had endorsed the Washington Spring Campaign

because Andrew Young, the Executive Vice President of the SCLC,

had told them that the SCLC would notify the Police on anything

they did. Levison questioned how Young could have promised this

since he

He said this is good because

this is the Jewish establishment.

Levison described the Washington Jewish Conmunity

the country, all of whom are Democrats and "tied into the machines"

Levison referred to Jack Greenberg (Director of the Legal

that is to

Dear Sir,

Di. Martin Luther King Jr. has announced that he will lead

a "poor peoples' campaign" in Washington, D.C. this spring.

This campaign will demand that the Congress of the United States

take immediate action to provide jobs u Incumo for the nation's

mure than do million poor. As you must well know, the question

of poverty is the crucial issue facing this country today. It thre-

tens to literally tear the United States apart at the seams. Dr.

King and the Southern Christian, Leadership Conference feel that

the clergy has a moral obligation to take the lead in the quest of

social justice and to reweave the moral fabric of this nation. The

job is massive and the time is short, we must act now. I'm sure

that that point isn't debatabe. The question is, what can we do?

Dr. King has dispatched organizers into fifteen major urban areas

across the nation to bring poor people to Washington in April, 1968.

They need your assistance to do their job. Attached is a leaflet

designating who the SCLC representative is in your area and where

you can get in touch with him.

Please call him for further information.

regarding plans for the latter's visit to Virginia on March 30,

1968.

these plans, which are subject to change, are that Dr. King

•will visit Danville, Virginia, and Prince Edward County, Virginia,

on the latter date.

He will appear at a rally held at & Negro

church in Richmond, Virginia, later in the day of March 30,

1968.

accoraing to Reverend smith,

the purpose of Di. King's visit to

Virginia is to stimulate interest and participation in the WSF

as well as to promote the interest and growth of scic.

Reverend Smith and other sources, who are in a position

to learn of activities in connection with WSP. have advised

generally that they do not anticipate that promotion of WSP will

be too successful in the Richmona area. They based their

opinions on past experiences in this type of activity.

They

advised these have not been too successful in the past, describing

race relations in the Richmond area as good.

They pointed out that there exists in Richmond a "nidale-

class complacency" that has prevented a concerted or mass united

reeh, is based on the fact there are jobs for Negroes and thiey

group is, compared to other areas, economically well ofi.

They pointed

out

that Negroes have

city jobs and in other positions formerty available only to

PROGRESS REPORT

As of this date information received indicates Rev. E.

RANDEL, OSBURN and MICHAEL, BIBLER, who are in charge of the WSP

in Cleveland, have been spending some of their time on recruiting

activities for the wsr, but the bulk of their activity has been

on two other projects: namely, operation Breadbasket and a sürike

at St. Luke's Hospital of the

Building service and Maintenance

Union: which was

recently settled.

How that the strike is settled,

OSBUKiN and BIBIER can devote more time to the wsP to recruit the

200 people to travel to Washington, D.C., in April, 1958.

Reportedly Rev. OSBURN is very hopeful of recruiting

these 200 people as he does not feel it is a large number to

obtain as he has recruited larger nmbers of individuals in

past for other projects.

"If I understand Dr. King's program, he says he

is going to keep his followers in Washington indefinitely.

Let's take a short period of 14 days.

Feeding each person

will cost at least $1.00 a day. This then, is 23,00.

In April weather even in Washington, these

people will have

to save some kind of shelter over their heads at night. If

" can get this for $1.00 per person per night, he will

be lucky. This is another $3, 000 per day.

To provide

other necessities that people

require each day, will cost

a minimum.or 50g per person a day. This adds

another $1,500.

So, at the lowest possible estimate, each person will cost

$2.50 per day. For 3,000 people, this adds up to $105,000

for just 14 days.

"Then, there are the expenses of Dr. King's staff and

other functionaries.

The traveling expense of these people

going and coming.

The whole thing will add up to a staggering

anount of somebody's money.

"How does Dr. King propose to raise this money?

Meving on faith is one thing, but, 3,000 people, no matter

how much faith they have, need food and shelter. Somebody

will have to produce this in fact, not theory.

"Since most, if not all of the people Dr. King is trying

to recruit are poor and unemployed, wouldn't it be better to

try to get these people into training programs in their local

communities?

Granting that some southern communities may not

have such federally financed programs, isn't it better to

petition the government to provide them rather than

taking these people off on a wild goose chase to Washington

where, no matter what happens, they will have to go back to

their

home connunities for whatever beneilts they are to

eventually receive.

RE: WASHINCTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

"Since lobbying for meaningful civil rights legis-

lation is the announced goal of Dr. King's efforts, Isn't

he really using these unfortunate people who can least

afford the time or money, as human pawns.

Inspiring them

with promises as an inducement to get their participation,

is creating a false hope of personal reward before they

return home. If they return home disillusioned and empty

"This must not be permitted to happen.

The best

way to prevent it, is not to take them to Washington

in the first place.

If a demonstration of power or force

oi whatever you want to call it, is deemed necessary in

Washington, then let those who can afford it march on

Congress and the President. Past efforts have proven that

sizeable numbers can be induced to turn out for a just cause.

"I an afraid Dr.

King's venture is frought with

rry dangers and problems.

The Negro has a just cause.

there is urgent need for putting pressure at every point

in our civil rights fight to achieve meaningful results.

This pressure should be pushed at the local, state and

national levels.

Every resource

at the Negro's command should

be pressed into the fight.

"On this, Dr. King or no one else will find any

opposition. However, doing something just for the publicity

of it and, using unfortunate human beings, is just going too

faX.

"It would be most unfortunate if what happened to

the bonus marchers in the late twenties during the Hoover

administration, happened to Dr. King's marchers. Unfortunately,

the present feeling of a large segment of white people is to

use the police force and, even the National Guard and the U.s.

Army to supress any riots. You can see from the way the

National Guard acted recently in Orangeburg, s.C., what to.

expect in any future riots. Every law enforcement agency

has been

in special training during the winter months.

They

have been given special riot control techniques.

Special

equipment and supplies have already been purchased for use.

There is no reason then for deliberately creating situations

that may endanger the lives of innocent Negroes.

"I certainly hope Dr. King and his staff will think

very carefully about what they do and how they do It.

Racial tensions in this country are now at a high pitch.

Entirely too many people are of the mind that another

bloody summer is in the offing. No matter what anybody

says, Negroes have not benefited in any substantial way

from

any riot.

Other than a looters holiday, the riots

of the past have been very costly to all Negroes.

not become another frustrating, bloody battleground."

"The Cleveland Press", a Cleveland daily afternoon

newspaper of general circulation, in its March 6, 1968 issue,

page A8, had an article entitled,

"200 Clevelanders Sought

fOr DI.

King's March"

", which read as follows:

"Efforts have begun to enlist 200 Clevelanders to

take part in the 'jobs or income! demonstration to be led.

by Ix. Martin Luther King in Washington on Apr. 22.

"The goal is to have 200 representatives from 15

cities, totaling 3000 participants, reported Hilbert

Perry, director of the Bruce Klunder Freedom House.

"The Freedom House is one of three groups here

which have endorsed the demonstration and are recruiting

participants.

The others are Domestic Workers of

America, a union of household workers, and the Cleveland

Welfare

Rights Movement, made up mostly of mothers on

relief rolls and their supporters.

"They are attempting to raise funds to charter buses

to washington and also seeking contributions to pay for child

care of mothers taking part, or families who will volunteer

to tend children.

"IN WASHINGTON, churches are to be asked to provide

meals and lodgings for those taking part.

"Perry said those being recruited here cennot be in-

formed yet of what form the demonstration will take be-

cause plans are still being worked out by Dr. King's head-

quarters in Atlanta.

But it is expected to start with mass

calls on senators and representatives from the communities

represented.

sovised on March 12, 1968, that Reverend E. RANDEL QSBURN

and i cABh BIBLER are the two main individuals who have been

working to organize the wst group in the cleveland area, however,

they also have some other unknown individuals who are assisting

in the recruiting activities.

For the most part, OSBURN and BIBER have been working

on two other projects which seem to take most of their time;

namely, Cperation Breadbasket, which is a program aimed at

increasing Negro employment through a boycott of various stores

and employers; the second is the strike at St. Luke's Hospital,

cleveland, ohio, by une Suilding, Service, and Maintenance Union.

this strike was recently settled, which will now give reverend

OSRUEN and BIBLER more time to work on the WSP.

The WSP in Cleveland has an office at 7902 Hough

Avenue, which is not being used as all the work is being done

from Reverend OSBURN's apartment at the Park Lane Villa Hotel,

cleveland, Ohio.

The WSP has been recruiting people in Cleveland

through the Bruce Klunder Freedom House, the Domestic Workers

inion, and Mothers on Welfare. Reverend OSBURN plans to recruit

two hundred people from the poor areas, those on welfare, etc.,

anu OSBURN feels he will not have too much trouble in getting

this many people as he has recruited larger numbers in the past

for other projects.

Reverend OSBUFIT has not indicated who will

take care of the families of those making this WSP trip to

Washington, D.C. in April, 1969, where the money will come from

to pay for the transportation, or living expenses in that city,

February cJ,

It said that the event was organized by

'Freedomways" Magazine and inaugurated a year of celebratior

of the 100th Anniversary of the birth of Dr. DuBois. DuBois

was described as a "scholar, writer, teacher, organizer and

Communist"

The article stated that Dr. Martin Luther King

delivered the address honoring the DuBois Centennial Year.

It recounted King's remarks in praise of DuBois and said

that:

"Summing up DuBois' life, King declared 'We can't

talk of Dr. DuBois without recognizing that he was a radical

all of his life.

Some people would like to ignore the fact

that he was a Communist in his later years:

It is worth

noting that Abraham Lincoln warmly welcomed the support of

Karl Marx during the Civil War and corresponded with him

freely'."

The article also stated that "King was vigorously

applauded when he said:

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Levison told Jones that he had received an excellent

response to a recent mailing. The solicitations were running

ahead of last year with $15,000 being received in one day.

Levison informed that the letter soliciting funds was carefully

written explaining King's project and, because of the success,

he was sending it to 250,000 more people.

Levison also told Jones that things are going well

in the mobilization for the project and King informed him that

people from Alabama and Mississippi are "just raring to go."

OBSERVATIONS:

On February 28, 1968, a WFO informant informed us

that Bernard Lafayette, project Director for SCLC, had informed

him King's organization is experiencing difficulty with re-

cruiting demonstrators for the "Washington Spring Project."

Because of this, the demonstrations would not start the first

week of April as originally planned.

Another WFO informant learned from Lafayette's

assistant, Anthony Henry, that a secret meeting had been held

by King's group and they had set April 27, 1968, as the date

for the project to start. Henry indicated this date can be

Imoved up or back depending on future developments.

It is felt that the President would be interested in

receiving information showing the communist help King is re-

ceiving in his proposed 'Washington Spring Project."

latter pant of February 1968

mentioned to several officers of

chairla endeagor to discuss with President Lyndon B. Johnsor

problems of Ghetto people; two, the advisability of Reverend

King addressing a joint session

of Congress as to problems

consider legal action against the United States Government for

financial redress to Negroes

based upon the many years the

American Negro has been held in "slavery". Rutherford offered

Concerning the possibility of him meeting with

President Johnson, Reverend King merely commented he felt

that at the present time the President would realize a greater

On February 28, 1968, a confidential source advised

that during the recent past Milliam A. Rutherfora, Executive

Director, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, (SCLC)

had suggested that SCLC consider the practicality of

periodically publishing a form of intra-organization

newspaper.

Rutherford explained the purpose of such a

publication would be essentially to maintain a closer

relationship between SCLC Headquarters personnel and

Field Staff.

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADINSHIP CONFERENCE

Rutherford's suggestion was recently adopted

by SCLC and the Department of Information, SCIC, 1s

currently in the process of preparing such a publication

which will be entitled, "soul Forth"

This paper is Ga

recruited for SCLC's forthcoming Washington Spring Project

(WSP) by explaining such topics as the necessity for

Federal legislation regarding jobs or income, various

objectives of the WSP, general news about the project,

et cetera.

Martin Luther King, Jr., on the night of February 23, 1960;

to the "Freedomways" Magazine sponsored affair at Carnegie

The same source learned on February 24, 1900, that

on that date, Stanley Levison told Clarence Jones about the

affair sponsored by

"Freedomways" Magazine on the night of

February 23, 1968.

Levison said he believed it illustrates

the degree of despair and depression prevalent in progressive

circles:

He described it as the

"deadest meeting"-he had

ever seen and said that people are depressed because they

frustrated over the Vietnam War and also feel there are no

answers to riots in the streets. Referring to Martin Luther

King's speech, he said that King has never read anything as

at the meeting.

He said that King felt it was his duty to

pay a tribute to(w.E.B.) DuBois but also knew it was not really

He said King read his speech as if he

reliable information in the past, advised that Reverend

Martin Luthes King, Jr. traveled to the Edwards, Mississippi

Political Welfare Rights (MPVR). He advised that the pur-

pose of the meeting was for king to solicit support for

his Poor Peoples March at Washington, D.C. in April, 1968,

and also to lend support to MPWR's

activities. Source

related that King planned to complete his appearances in

Mississippi on February 15, 1968, and travel to Montgomery,

Alabama, where a similar meeting was to be held. He advised

that presently in Grenada, Mississippi, Leon Wilbert Hall

and R. B. Cottonreader, Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) employees, were actively attempting to

locate individuals to travel to Washington, D.C. in April,

1968, to take part in the demonstration.

Source advised

that

Reverend B. J. Cameron, President, Grenada County

Freedom Movement, and affiliate of SCLC, will not travel to

Washington in the Spring.

On February 19, 1968, the source advised that Hall

was scheduled to appear before an unknown group at Batesville,

Mississippi, the evening of february 19, 1908, in an effort

to gain support for the Washington Spring Project.

On February 20, 1968, a second source, who has

furnished reliable information

in the past, advised that

Dr. Martin Luther King appeared before a group known as the

National Welfare Rights Organization, together with his

aides, in Chicago, Illinois, on February 3-4, 1968. He

advised that this group is operating in Mississippi as the

MPWR.

He stated that delegates from 24 states were present

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

at the Chicago, Illinois meeting which resulted in a

working coalition being established between this group and

SCLC to bring about a social change in the country. The

source advised that King also put forth requests for support

of his Poor Peoples March in April at Washington, D.C.

He advised that the delegate from Mississippi was one

Geraldine Smith, Holmes County, Mississippi, and furthermore

that the National President of

this organization was an

individual from Los Angeles, California.

On February 20, 1968, a third source advised that

Martin Luther King's

group is attempting to recruit 200

persons to participate in the April 26; 1968, demonstration

at Washington, D.C. He related that the primary recruiter

in this project in Mississippi appeared to be Mike Higson,

research worker, Lawyers Committee, .

233 North Farish Street,

Jackson, Mississippi.

On February 17, 1968, a fourth source who has

furnished reliable information

in the past, advised that a

recent meeting was held in Washington, D.C. in which

Reverend Martin Luther King and the former SNCC Chairman

Stokely Carmichael were present.

A discussion at this

meeting centered around the Washington Spring Project.

The source felt that the Project was completely controlled

by King and that any attempts to take over for the purpose

of promoting violence will meet with little success.

The

source reported that Carmichael stated something to the

effect "If King is going to run it, then that will be

all right"'.

The source advised that a meeting was to take,

place in Miami, Florida, February 19-23, 1968, and that this

meeting was being financed partially by the Ford Foundation

for the purpose of training Negro Ministers from large

northern cities in the area of leadership. Source related

that the captioned matter would possibly be discussed at

the meeting, but that was not the primary purpose for the

session.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Inspector OWEN W. DAVIS and Detective SILAS VAUGHN,

Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, D. C:, presently

in miami on assignent, statea

February 21, 1968, that they

attended workshop neetings and a general meeting on February

20, 1968.

There was no discussion at these meetings relative

to the lashington Spring Project.

The meetings generally

related to the Ministers leadership Training Program, as

outlined in a leaflet distributed

to the delegates.

Inspector DAVIS estimated 20 Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) members among the delegates.

He said most

of the delegates are ministers from various sections of the

United States.

Inspector DAVIS stated & press conference was held

February 20, 1968, with DI. ANDREW YOING and Reverend T. Y.

ROGERS, Jha, answaring most of the questions.. Dr. MARTIN

LUTHER

KING

was not present at the press conference and has

not been seen at the Sheraton Four Ambassadors Hotel by any

of the security and hotel personnel on February 20, 1968, and

the morning of February 21, 1968.

MM T-1 furnished the following infornation; on

February 21, 1968:

The SCLC meeting which he is attending at the

The group of ministers attending was broken up

into workshop units of approximately nine or ten ministers

each.

Each group had a leader who directed the activities

of his workshop.

One such workshop was directed by Reverend JESSIE

JACKSON, Who is & SCIC leader from Chicago. During the

progress of this workshop, Reverend JACKSON made the following

statements:

HH 55147 DocId:32989577 Page 287

## Page 288

RE:

WASRINSTOS SPRING FROJECT

He advocated that at least 1000 ministers go to

Fashington to demand tat the trited States

pull out of

Viet ram.

te felt that if such activity could be arranged,

it would bring eufficient weight to bear to cause the

Government to take such action.

Fe discussed what as termed "bread basket project"

which ms described as as SCiC project wish would be

instituted in the large city ghettos, wherein economic

pressure would be brought on white merchants to employ

Negro

help and also on the white business commity to deposit funds

In Negro bank.

pojects were to be set up in advance

and if the desired result was not obtained,

then the SCIC

gould resort to picketing and demonstrating and this would be

brought about through pre arrangements whereby it would be

only necessary to mike a number of move calls and give

code word knock outr which would bring the desired pickets

and demonstrators

to s pre-arranged location.

The above mis discussed

In general terns and no

specific cities or areas were mentioned.

But this was

put forth as a

project that could be put into effect.

Reverend JAvES BEVEL, * KINd aide from Chicago,

addressed a group in wich he stated that he firmly believed

in burning down the citios if southing significant would

come out of it.

But that he did not believe in burning the

cities just for the sake of burning them.

(JAVES BEVEL is referred to in the Appendix

section or this memorandun. )

Reverend BEEL additionally nade the statement

that he had attemptes to get Negro leaders im New York to

burn down the city wren ADAM CLAYTON FOrELL lost his

Congressional seat, however, was mauccessful.

AlsO froN BEVEL's address, it mas apparent that

there is a marked groying tendency away fron de-segregation

and integration and& definite nove by the SoLc towrd

economic and political black power.

Additionally, 1t vas evident fron BEVEL'S address

that there is s growing tendercy to degrade the institutional-

ized church wien was descriced as the "Sunday Church" that is

well established in this country and to unite s1l of the

colored churches

into

one tremendous, poverful group.

A150,

there is evidence of attempts to bresk the moral fiber of

attending ministers.

As a1 exanple, Reverend BEVEL stated that

he was convinced and firmly belleved that vary was raped by a

Romn soldier and that christ sas not the result of a virgin

birth.

(First Nome Inknown) WOODRUFF,

an Episcopal minister

Philadelphis ms overheard to state

that he was head of the

"Liberation Schoul" In Philadelphia and

that he had many classes

in various homes in the srea,

He stated that he was in favor of

using terrorist tactics to achieve the ends of "Black Power."

Also, it was overheard that WOODRUFF allegedly had been

arrested in Nashville,

tennessee, some time ago for having

operated & "hate school."

On February

21, 1968, MN To2 furnished the

following information:

At & workshop meeting held on February 21, 1963,

the fact that the Ford Fourdation was paying for this

meeting was discussed.

the main topic of aiscussion was, corever.

"operation bread basket which is to be put into effect

by the ministers when they return to their respective

cities.

This project is to bring economic pressure upon

the white business community in order to secure better.

jobs, better housing, more pag and to generally improve

the conditions of the Negroes in the large ghetto areas.

Tis project will take the fory of a coordinated,

concerted effort to bring econonic pressure and efforts will

be made to coordinate this program throughout the country so

that economic pressure can be brought on some specific

segment of the economy on

& national basis. An example wes

given wherein picketing and demonstrations could occur

APPENDIX

JANES BEVEL

BEVEL, in early March, 1966, was observed to be

present at the offices of the West Side N.E.B. DuBois

Club in Chicago (DCC).

Discussion took piace at this time

centering around reaction to a recent notification that

the Attorney General of the United States intended to label

Dubois Clubs as a Communist front. BEVEL, in conversation,

stated that he rould have ignored this notification, and kept

sbout the work in which he was engaged. He felt that if the

DuBois Clubs have a real program of help for the people, then

people would answer

for the clubs despite any labels applied

to them.

Most present

agreed that the attack on the Dubois

Clubs was a cart of

the pian by

'the "establishment" to

undermine the civil rights movement.

They felt that the

recent hearings into Klar activities in this country was

only a

beginning which wold

lead to & Iull attack on the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the real

target.

me of those present stated during the

course of

this discussion

that he was not a cormnist, and to this

BEVEL Has overhearo

to reply that every thinking American

should be.

He stated that Negroes have not begun to read

yet, but when they do, they will all be socialists.

civil disobedience campaign in Washington, D. C., in the Spring

of 1968. .

• BACKGROUND:

King in the past has publicly announced he will

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

'RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

King is currently holding the first of two workshops

from 2/19-23/68 at Miami, Florida.

He has invited approximately

150 Negro ministers throughout the nation to attend this meeting.

The Ford Foundation recently gave King's organization a $230,000

grant to hold these workshops in an effort to develop responsible

leadership in the Negro ghetto areas of the nation's major cities.

It has been determined that King plans to discuss the Washington

Spring Project at this workshop.

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

has tried, without success, to dissuade King from executing

the Project. Dr. Morsell is afraid that King cannot control

the demonstrators and there is a likelihood that the overall

demonstration will be taken over by extremists.

King appears to be concentrating his attention on

the South where he has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft

to help speed him about urging people to support his campaign.

ATuK Act 6 jadvised recently that the entire Washington

Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision, petty

bickering among the staff members and the idiosyncrasies of

{King's ego. This source advised that King is worried about

the lack of progress being made by his recruiters.

He is

concerned about the success of the program. He has instructed

his staff to seriously consider whether or not they can

successfully carry out the Project. If they cannot then it

will be necessary to establish a reason as to why he finds

it necessary to discontinue the Washington Spring Project.

RECOMMENDATION:

That copies of the enclosures be forwarded to

Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House; Mr. William Welsh,

Administrative Assistant to the Vice President; Secretary of

Agriculture Freeman; Secretary of Labor Wirtz; Secretary of

Defense; Secret Service; the Attorney General; the Deputy

The following information has been supplied by

reliable information in the past.

Martin Luther King, JI., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, is holding the first of

two workshops to train Negro ministers in urban leadership

from February 19 through 23, 1968; at Miami, Florida. He

has invited approximately 150 Negro ministers throughout

The Ford Foundation recently gave King's organiza-

tion a $230,000 grant to hold these workshops in an effort to

develop responsible leadership in the Negro ghetto areas of

the Nation's major cities.

It has been determined that King's massive civil

disobedience campaign, which he calls the "Washington Spring

Project," will be discussed at this workshop.

National ASSo Jaton Mo she Vanteent ExeCutive Directo,

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

This past week King concentrated his attention on

the South and spoke at rather large gatherings in Birmingham,

Montgomery, and Selma, Alabama.

King has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft to

help speed him about the South urging people to support his

Washington Spring Project:

Another source advised recently that the entire

Washington Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision,

petty bickering among the staff members, and the idiosyncrasies

of King's ego. This source advised that King is worried about

the lack of progress being made by his recruiters. He is con-

He has instructed his

staff to seriously consider whether or not they can successfülly

carry out the Project. If they cannot, then it will be necessary

to establish a reason as to why he finds it necessary to dis-

continue the Washington Spring Project.

In this connection, the "Miami Herald" newspaper on

February 18, 1968; reported that some Negro leaders will urge

• King to detour his planned massive civil disobedience demon-

stration scheduled for April, 1968, in Washington, D. C.; and

redirect the demonstrators to the local districts of Congressmén

who have voted against civil rights legislation. These leaders

feel that Congressmen do not care what happens in :

These Leaders

Washington, D. C., but they would feel the impact of these

demonstrations in their home districts.

Miami, Florida

February 20, 1968

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to communication from this Bureau

dated February 19, 1968.

The "Miami Herald" a local Miami, Florida, newspaper

on February 20, 1968, reported that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,

opened a series of meetings in Miami, Florida, on February

1968, designed to help Negro clergymen minister to the Social'

•and economic needs of their congregations. This article report-

ed that Dr. KING and Reverend ANDREW YOUNG, one of his top aides

im the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), said the

five-day series of conferences will not include planning for

civil rights or anti-war demonstrations.

It was also reported that Dr. KING and Reverend YOUNG

both said they did not expect STOKELY CARMICHAEL and RAP BROWN,

leaders of the vocal Black Nationalist militancy to attend.

However, Reverend YOUNG said, "If STOKELY aNd RAP COme we

won't throw them out." This article goes on to report that

, In sadition to the 150 official delegates, about 50 more

ministers are expected to attend the meetings, which are

not.

It was reported that about 125 delegates attended a

luncheon on February 19, 1968, and heard a talk by or: tA.

ABERNATHY, 3 Vice-President of SCiC.

In addition, this

article reports that three lecturers; followed by workshop

sessions, are scheduled for February

20, 1968.

MM T-1 advised that the Ministers Conference at the

neraton Four Ambassadors, Miami, Florida, opened on schedule

on February 19, 1968.

In welcoming the group, Dr. MARTIN

LUTHER KING, JR., reiterated that the purpose of this

conference was for discussion, study and training in

connection with problems facing the Negroes in the big city

areas.

RE: HASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

He further stated that attention would be given to

attempting to reconcile the term "black power" with the over-

all civil rights novement in the United States. During the

opening conference, nonviolence was continuously stressed.

Dr. KING stated that over-integration could occur to

the point that Negroes could lose their identity. He gave

as an example the integration of the Methodist Church, however,

this was not further explained.

The only remark that was made to the people in

attendance relative to the "Washington trip" was that this

conference in Miami would not be used for the purpose of

recruiting people for the trip to haskington, nor would it be

a topic of discussion.

wo into "workstor writs", 1568, the entire group will be broken

according to their interest and needs

of the area from

which the various ministers came. All leaders

are to take part in the activities of the workshop and report

back to the entire assemoly.

During the opening day of this neeting, only one

item of dissension occurred and that involved some opposition

to the fact that apparently DAN MONAHAN, who was formerly

..

connected with Urban Housing, has been

invited to address

, the

conference in Miani. Some ministers disagreed with this

lavitation, however, Reverend ANDREY YOUNG stated that his

presence could contribute to the conference, and that he

should be heard.

Included in the literature was a leaflet captioned

In addition, a state-

ment made by Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING,

on

December 4, 1967, which staterent relates to the

Washington

"CRISIS OF THE CITIES: A CREATIVE ANGLE

"The Ministers Leadership Training Program is

designed to train local leaders in the knowledge of

the many problems which the residents of the ghetto

face and in ways of solving these problems.

Our

focus is the Black Preacher and the Black church for

we believe that the greatest potential power for

controlling the forces which make and sustain as well

as those which can change the structure of the ghetto,

is within the Black church. He further believe that

because of the central place for which the Black

church holds in the Negro community, ye can develop

the kind of leadership which will develop programs to

transfer control of the ghetto to those who reside

there. Finally, the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference is an extension of the church and therefore

much of our emphasis should be on strengthening the

witness of the church in areas of 1ife where problems

are greatest.

"The Ministers Leadership Training Program will be

conducted in fifteen metropolitan areas of our nation.

We have selected a minimum of eight and a maximum

Of twenty preachers from these fifteen areas, depend-

ing upon the size and population, who will participate

in our program. Our

program begins with an orientation

workshop in Midni, Florida.

This workshop is

designed to acquaint the preachers who will partici-

pate in our program with the over all history and

philosophy of the Southern Christian Lesdership

Conference and with the programs which demand our

concern at present.

This workshop is also designed

to acquaint the participants with the

nature and scope

"of the multiplicity of problems facing the residents of

the ghetto.

Our enchasis vill be on a detailed

examination of the forces

which make the ghetto a

reality; the structures wich mintain the ghetto;

and the possibility of destroying the ghetto by re-

structuring and changing ornership of the economic

structures of the ghetto. There will also be an

examination of the theology of the church, a look

re-defining

of the ethic of the Black church in terms of the

problems faced by Black churches today.

"To accomplish the above mentioned ends we

have invited to

this workshop persons with expertise

in the problems of the ghetto. They will deal with

"Making of the Ghetto,' 'the New Mythology,'

Action and Political Coslition,' the

'Challenge of an Urban Ministry,' 'Jobs,'

"Welfare

Rights,' "Nonviolence and Social Change,' and other

problems facing the poor.

"During the orientation workshop the cities will

be organized. A convener will be chosen for each

city with the exception of New York City which will

have a convener for Brooklyn amd Queens and

another for Vanhattan and the Bronx.

sixteen conveners will call the men of their cities

together once per week for study, discussion,

learning, planning and executing programs.

conveners will serve as the link between the

Atlanta office of the Ministers Leadership Training

Program and ths particular city involved, and will

channel prograns and information to the members

of their group.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT -

"Statement by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference

Atlanta, Georgia

"December 4, 1967

*Ladies and Gentlemen:

"Last week the staff of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference held one of the nost important

meetings we have ever convened. He had intensive

discussions and anelyses of our work and of the

challenges which confront us and our nation, and at

the end we made a decision which I wish to announce

today.

62232

"The Southern Christian Leadership Conference

will lead waves of the nation's poor and disinherited

to Washington, D. C., next spring to demand redress of

their grievances by the United States government and

to secure at least jobs or income for all.

"We will go there, we will demand to be heard,

and we will stay until

America responds. If this

means forcible repression of our movement, we will

confront it, for we

have done this before.

If this

means scorn

or ridicule, we embrace it, for that is

what America's poor now

receive.

If it means jail, we

accept it willingly, for the millions of poor already

are imprisoned by exploitation and discrimination.

But we hope, with growing confidence, that our campaign

in Washington vill receive at first a sympathetic

understanding across our nation, followed by dramatic

expansion of nonviolent demonstrations in Washington

and simultaneous protests elsewhere.

In short, we

will be petitioning our government moves against

poverty.

"We have now begun preparations for the

vashington campaign.

Our staff will soon be taking

new assignments to

organize people to go to lashington

from 10 key cities and 5 rural areas.

This will be

no mere one-day march in Washington, but a trek to

the nation's caplisl by suffering and outraged citizens

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

"who will go to stay until some definite and positive

action is taken to provide jobs and income for the

poOr.

"We are sending our staff into these key areas

to meet with the local leadership of these areas to

discuss their readiness to cooperate with us in this

venture.

"In the coming weeks we will disclose our

detailed plans on nobilizing this massive campaign.

and on the specific proposals which we are formulating.

"Today I would like to tell you why the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference has decided to under-

take this task with the advice and participation we

anticipate from other organizations

and thousands of

individuals.

"America is at a crossroads of history, and it

is critically important for us, a nation and a society,

to choose a new path and move upon it with resolution

and courage.

"It is impossible to under-estimate the crisis we face

in America.

The stability of a civilization, the potential

of free government, and the simple honor of men are at

stake.

"Those who serve in the human-rights movement,

Including our Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

are keenly aware of the increasing bitterness and

despair and frustration that threaten the worst chaos,

hatred and violence any nation has ever encountered.

* In a

sense, we are already at war with and among

ourselves

Affluent Americans are locked into suburbs

of physical confort and mental insecurity; poor Americans

are locked inside ghettoes of naterial privation and

spiritual debilitation; and all of us can almost feel

the presence of a kind

of social insanity which could

lead to national ruin.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

"Consider,

for example, the spectacle of cities

burning while the national government speaks of

repression instead of rehabilitation.

Or think of

children starving in Mississippi while prosperous

farmers are rewarded for not producing food.

Negro mothers leaving children in tenements to work

in neighborhoods where people of color can not live,

Or the awesome bombardment, already greater than

the munitions re exploded

in World II, against a small

Asian land, while political brokers de-escalate and

very nearly disarm a timid action against poverty.

Or a nation gorged on money while millions of its

citizens are denied a good education, adequate health

services, decent housing, meaningful

and even

respect, and are

employment,

then toid to

• be responsible.

"The true responsibility for the existence of

these deplorable conditions lies ultimately with the

larger society, and much of the immediate respon-

sibility for removing the injustices can be laid

directly at the door of the federal government.

"This is the

institution which has the power to

act, the resources to tap, and the duty to respond.

And

yet, this very government now lacks the will to

make reforms which

are demanded by & rising chorus

across the nation. According to the Farris Poll, for

example, a substantial majority of Americans believe

that we

must proceed at once to tear down and rebuild

the slums, and a solid majority feel that everyone

should have a job. Concerned leaders of industry, civil-

rights organizations, labor unions and churches are

joining in such groups as the new Urban Coalition to

urge progressive economic measures at the national

level:

Many urban political leaders are ready to

carry

out enlightened programs 11 only the federal

government will provide the needed financial support.

Newsweek magazine recently devoted

an entire issue to

the problem of racisn in

America and set forth some

sound proposals for

dealing with this situation.

"I cite these facts merely to show that a clear

majority in Anerica are asking for the very things

which we will demand in

fashington.

this age of

wizardry and political innorality, the

poor are demanding that the basic need of people be met

Poor

people can not long be placated by the giamour of

Poor people

who encounter racial discrinination every day in every

aspect of their lives can not be fooled by patronizing

gestures and half-way promises.

Poor people who are

Washington and other areas.

Similarly, we will be

calling on the swelling masses of young people in this

country who are disenchanted with this mterialistic

society, and asking them to join us in our new

We also look for participation

by regresentatives of the millions of non-Negro poor-

Indians, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Appalachians,

and others.

And we shall welcome assistance from all

Americans of good will.

"And so, we have decided to go to Washington and

to use any means of legitimate nonviolent protest

necessary to move our nation and our government on a

new course of social, economic, and political reform.

As I said before,

the power to

initiate this reform

resides in washington.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to communication from the Miami

Office of the Federal Bureou of Investigation dated February

10, 1968.

reported February 18, 1968,

that some Negro

not further

identified, will urge Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., at meetings

in Miami, Florida, to detour ais planned massive civil dis

obedience demonstration scheduled for April in Washington, D.C.

The Negro leaders will recommend that efforts be redirected

to demonstrate in districts of Congressmen who have voted

against civil rights legislation.

The "Miami Herald" reported that one prominent civil

rights leader, who requested his identity be withheld, said

"Congressmen could care less about demonstrations in Washington--

and Negroes could be made to look bad nationally. But if the

demonstrations are held in the home districts of certain

Congressmen they most certainly will feel the impact."

MM T-I advised on February 19, 1968, that Di. MARTIN

LUTHER KING, JR., arrived at the Sheraton Four Ambassadors

Hotel at 10:30 PM on February 18, 1968.

DI. KING refused to

utilize the suite reserved for him and kept moving from room

to room. Two of DI. KING's aides, identified as Dr. A. YOUNG

and Reverend F. C. BENNETT, made & thorough check of the

Dr. KING, apprently looking for a

"bugging

device."

Dr. KING, through Dr. YOUNG and Reverend BENNETT,

according to the source, has already refused to be interviewed

by the

various news media and it appeared to the source that

KING was quite concerned with the anount of security being

effected by the Sheraton Four Ambassadors Hotel, along with

local authorities.

On February 9, 1968, a confidential source, who

nas turnished reliable information in the past, said

Albeft turner, state of Alabama leader oi the washingtor

Spring Project, and State of Alabama recruiter for the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) addressed

a meeting of the Alabama Action Committee (AAC), a Civil

Rights Group, at Montgomery, Alabama, on February 5, 1958.

At the times

Turner divulged that the ScLo received a

$25,000 grant within the last ten days from the Ford Foredation:

which was to help defray expenses of the uperming sou:

demonstrations to be held at Washington, D. C. this sprint.

Turner, the source said, is attempting to recruit

200 persons in Alabama for the Washington Spring project.

He is concentrating his activities in this regard in the

following seven counties:

Dallas

Monroe

Lowndes

Bullock

Montgomery

Macon

Autauga

The source added that Richard

Director of the AC, made an appearance tolley be cutter's

talk at the AAC meeting held on February 5, 1968, at Montgomery.

Boone confirmed Turner's announcement about the $25,000

contributed by the Ford foundation.

ALRANA ATION CAPINIETE=

Seemingly,

Turner and Boone have some kind of a

working agreement, the source said.

It would also appear,

the source said, that some kind of alliance exists between

the SCiC and the AAC, for the fact that Turner used a meeting

of the AAC as a platform to raise his quota of 200 demonstrators

for the Washington Spring Project.

the AAC and the SCLC are cooperating in the Washington

he has discovered nothing to cause him

to believe that Martin Luther king and Richard Boone are

not still at odds.

A second confidential source, who has furnished

reliable internation in the past, on february là and 15,

1960, advised that he had received a written notice, which

was undated, fron Albert Tuner at Marion, Alabama, inviting

him to attend a meeting to be held on Friday, February 16,

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

RACIAL MATTERS

On February 15, 1968, a confidential source, who

has furnished reliable information in the past, advised as

follows:

On february 12, 1968, a meeting of members of the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) was held at

the Paschel Motor Inn, Atlanta, Georgia, concerning the

Washington Spring Project which is planned to take place

during the first part of April, 1968, in Washington, D. C.

The following SCIC officers and staff members were present

at this meeting:

Martin Luther King:

President of SCLC

Reverend James Bevel

Reverend Jesse Jackson

Andrew Young

Bernard La Fayett

Hosea Williams

Reverend Fred C. Bennette

Bill. Rutherford

J. T. Johnson

Ralph Henry

Stoney Cooks

The discussion during this meeting primarily concerned

the march from Baltimore, Maryland, to Washington, D. C., which

is to signal the beginning of the Washington Spring Project.

It was reported at this meeting that there is believed to be

Re: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

a serious threat against the life of Martin Luther King and

that an attempt upon his life will be made during this march.

In order to counteract such an attempt, Reverend Bennette

was assigned to be in charge of security for Martin Luther

King and Ralph Henry was assigned to be Reverend Bennette's

assistant. It was indicated that those involved in this

security should be alert for danger, not only from white

persons but also from Negroes. No additional information

was given at this time concerning any possible threats.

It was reported by several of those present that

serious difficulty had been encountered in the northern states

in recruiting participants for the Washington Spring Project.

It was, therefore, decided to concentrate the recruitment of

participants in the southern states.

It was also reported that serious financial problems

have developed, especially in certain areas. Hosea Williams

presented proposed budgets for the "financially deprived or

unresponsive areas involved in the Washington campaign." He

stated that for one reason or another the following areas

seemed to be having unsolved financial problems in getting

their mobilization and recruiting started:

Mississippi

Alabama

Georgia

North Carolina

South Carolina

Virginia

Washington, D. C.

Baltimore, Maryland

Williams

, stated that it was originally planned that

each project area

was to raise its own tunds,

however,

does not seem possible in the

poorer areas at this time. • He

reported that he had conferred

with project leavers in the

above areas and they state that they can do the job provided

they are

furnished the resources to get it started.

Based on

Williams'

conversations

with these leaders, a budget has been

drawn up for each of the above areas which

provides between

$1,200 to 51,500 per month with the exception

of South Carolina

which will receive $740 and Washington, D. C.; which

will

receive $3,500.. These budgets include payments for items such

Washington Spring Project.

KING

On 1/29/68 at an SCLC Executive Staff meeting

announced HOSEA WILLIAMS would serve as "Field

Director" in Washington, D. C., of the WSP and also have

overall supervision of SCIC personnel involved in this

project (re Atlanta airtel and LM 2/2/68). ANDREW J.

Youid, Executive Vice President, SCLC, at that time was

instructed by KING to write a letter

member previously assigned to various cities and locations

to recruit demonstrators for the WSP in which he was to

the is a vien

SCIC stafi

inform them of WILLIAMS' position.

On 2/12/68 WILLIAMS determined this letter had

not been written and as a result SCLC personnel did not

imon to whom they should report or from whom to seek

assistance.

WILLIAMS also submitted during the 2/12/68 meeting

a memorandum in which he requested a budget (of approximately $10,000)

a sacretary, and an Assistant in order to effectively supervise

the wSP.

There then ensured at this meeting considerable

patty discussion as

' to the validity of WILLIAMs' requests.

WIULIAM A. RUTHERFORD, Executive Director, SCIC, made 21

issue over tne tact he did not have the time or

inclination

to pess judgment on a multitude of vouchers which WILlIams

would submit in connection with his budget. WILLIAMS became

enraged and left the meeting for almost an hour. KING made

no effort to contol the disorganized discussion or to render

& deCiSiOn.

The 2/12/68 meeting adjourned without the staff

resching a decision on WILLIAMS'

requests. KING,

PARTRENFORD, and RALPH D. ABERNATAY, Vice President and

Treasurer, SCLe, were supposed to meet regarding these issues or 83/

Insormant did not have opportunity to participate in this

necting and as of 2/14/68 had no further information regarding

this matter.

Informant observed that there appears to be a

costinuing battle of personalities between WILLIAMS and

RONEERFORD. He also observed that KING seems to be in a

substantial twofold dilemma predicated upon his tremen

2

AT 157-2924

dous ego, ie.; one,

should he cooperate fully with WILLIAMS

which probably will insure the success of the WSP but at

the same time vill permit WILLIAMS to have the limelight and

possibly become a virtual hero; two, should he keep WILTIAMS

more or less throttled despite his refusal to accept WILIAMS®

recent resignation and take a chance the WSP will be successful

without the benefit of WILLIAMS' full energies or take a chance

the WSP may not succeed and have the national and international

image of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., become tarnishea..

It is

because of the latter informant

believes that KING has indicated

he is considering the possibility of finding an excuse to drop

she WSP.

Based upon information herein and previous information

submitted it is felt informant's observations are reasorab

accurate.

Almost half the period of time criginally planned

by SCIC to recruit and train its WSP demonstrators has passed and

the entire project seems to be suffering from indecision and

petty

wangles on the past of the ScLo staff, not to mention the

"giosyncrasies of KING's ego.

At this point it would appear SCLC will require a good

moscare of luck to make its WSP a successful venture by early

April.

February 15, 1968

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER.

A confidential source on February 14, 1968, advised

he had learned that Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.,

President,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), continued to

be discouraged with the lack of progress made by SCLC staff

members in recruiting and training demonstrators for SCLC's

'Washington Spring. Project, (WSP)•

In this connection Reverend

King recently held an

officers to consider the WSP.

"emergency meeting" of the SCIC Executive

Reverend King pointed out that sCLC has prevously

announced that it will have 5,000 demonstrators in washington,

D: Co, in early April 1968, Should. only a few hundred demonstrators

appear in Washington, D. C., Reverend King said he and SChC would

become the laughing stock of the nation.' He declared that if

SCIC produces 3,000 demonstrators and the nation fails to react

appropriately this will be the responsibility of the nation

i

and not SCIC: On the other hand, he said, SCLC will be greatly

at fault if it does not produce the announced number of

demonstrators.

Reverend King suggested that officers of SCIC seriously

consider whether or not they can successfully. carry out the

planned WSP. He said if they feel they cannot then it will be

necessary to establish a reason as to why he and SCIc finds

it necessary to discontinue the WSP.

dated January 31, 1968.

Confidential Informant PH T-l, who has furnished

Leadership Conference (SCLC), with headquarters in Atlanta,

Gae, would be in Philadelphia to hold meetings and work-

shops on february 9, 10, 1968. On Friday, February 9, 1968,

KING had meetings scheduled from 9:00 a.m. until late in the

evening with black church men, suburban groups, welfare

rights people, community leadership people, Afro-American

groups, educational people, and milltants of Philadelphia.

Attendance at the conferences would be by Invitation only.

All of the meetings were to be held at st. Thomas Protestant

Episcopal Church at 52nd and Parrish, whose rector 1s Father

JESSE ANDERSON.

KING was also scheduling meetings at the church

for saturday, February 10, 1968, with other Interested olv11

rights people from 8:00 a.M. to 12:00 noon.

The source also advised that the solo had rented

the name of the Philadelphia Christian Leadership Conference

which would be the headquarters of the Rev. JAMES ORANGE

and WILLIE TABB and his wife, advance coordinators for KING's.

endeavor to obtain volunteers in Philadelphia for the

washington Spring Project of SCIC.

Source advised that KING arrived In Philadelphia

at 7:30 a.m. on February 9, 1968, from New York City by air

and

attempted to hold the first meeting with Negro miniaters

at st. Thomas Churah; however, only two ministers were pre-

sent by 10:20 a.M. KINQ had four other groups scheduled to

meet for an hour and an hour and a half apiece until 4:00

In the afternoon when a free period was scheduled plus

dinner and more meetings of other groups were scheduled

from 8:00 p.I. untll late at night.

Since no more than 15.

people showed up to take part in KING's activity at the

church, Dr. KING held a press conference at 11:45 a.m.

H1S

remarks to the assembled press dealt mainly with the Vietnam

war, national polley of the United States Government, and

Pueblo incident.

Dr. KING then left the church for lunch and

shortly after 3:00 p.ll. he returned to the church at the

Insistence of the Rev. ANDERSON, whereupon KING agreed

reluctantly to address the group with the stipulation he

spend no more than 15 minutes with them. There were approxi-

mately 20 people spoken to by Dr. KING.

After meeting with this group Dr. KING talked with

another group

which was designated as

"welfare rights

organizationg" and apparently the Rev. JAMES ORANGE alSO

addressed this group because subsequent to this meeting

several women were overheard to say "that ORANCE 1s a llar

and can do nothing for Mr. KING. He 1s a phony in every

sense of the word."

Dr. KING left the church at approximately 4:00 p.u.

for dinner and relaxation and returned at 8:20 p.m. to appear"

before a group of Individuals Identified as Afro-American

groups, militants, and educational people, there were

approximately 30 people in attendance and this meeting

lasted no more than 20 minutes.

The source advised that Dr. KING was extremely

annoyed,

agitated, and disappointed by the lack of atten-

dance at the meetings and he did not desire to return for

the evening meetings; however, he was tole by telephone

over a hundred people

were waiting when In reality there

were only about 30.

A conversation was overheard to the effect that

who 1s in charge of the Philadelphia office at 2102

Diamond Street of SCIC's Washington Spring Project, sald thisisa

temporary headquarters and will only be used in in attempt

to secure partioipants

for the Washington Spring Project.

KING has no further plans of any activity in Philadelphia

other than this recruitment.

KING's plans for meeting with groups on Saturday

morning were cancelled and acoording to press publlcity KING

was suffering from laryngitis; however, It 1$ the considered

opinion of the source that KING was piqued at the lack of

attendance at the Friday meetings.

The source also advised that there had apparently

been a concerted effort made by some unknown Individual to

• persuade ministers not to cooperate with KING by not showing

up at the Friday morning first conference.

This could very

Iikely be true since there were only two Negro ministers on

hand for the Friday morning meeting.

It would also appear from overheard conversations

and comments that KING's advance men, DRANCE and TABB, did

not do an effective job.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

CONFIDENTIAL

On January 22, 1968, a second confidential source,

advised an SA of the FBI that a

workshop to study non-violent

demonstration techniques was held at the Ohio State University

Student Union building, Columbus, Ohio, on January 20 and 21,

1968.

The second confidential source advised as follows:

The workshop was scheduled to be held from

10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., January 20, 1968, and from 11:00 a.m.

o 11:00 p.m.,

January 21, 1968.

HOwever,

participants in

the workshop did not begin arriving for the workshop until

late in the afternoon of January 20, 1968. • There were approxi-

mately twenty-six individuals present when the workshop finally

got underway.

Pat Shafer, field secretary of the Ohio Peace

Action Council, was in charge of the workshop.

The principal speakers at the workshop were

Reverend Ed Randall Osburn, Cleveland, Ohio, associated with

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); Mike

Bibler; and James Bristol, associated with the American

Friends Service Committee, (AFSC). Reverend Osburn had driven

to the workshop from Cleveland,

Ohio, with Mike Bibler, while

James Bristol had flown by airplane to Columbus, Ohio, from

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

From the afternoon of January 20, 1968, to the

conclusion of the workshop on that date

of non-violent demonstration techniques, there was no discussion

The discussions

centered around the Washington Spring Project, being sponsored

•by the SCLC at Washington, D.C., during the summer of 1968.

During their comments to the group, Reverend Osburn,

Bibler, and Bristol indicated they had

attended

a meeting of

the SCLC recently in Atlanta, Georgia,

where Martin Luther

King and other SCLC personnel discussed the Washington Spring

Project.

It was apparent that those three individuals had

been scheduled to attend the workshop in the Ohio Union building

for some time.

Reverend Osburn indicated the demonstration in

Washington, D. C., would be composed initially of about 3,000

people from poverty areas in the United States, including whites,

• Negroes, and Puerto Ricans.

Those persons would travel to

Washington, D. C., and during the first week or ten days would

"demonstrate on the issues of poverty and jobs. After that

period, the demonstration would pick up the peace issues.

Reverend Osburn indicated the Washington, D.C.,

demonstration would bes continuous program.

The initial

3,000 demonstrators would live in Washington, D.C., and carry

out demonstrations in the offices of Government officials and

in other pisces.

In tho event any of the original 3,000

demonstrators were removed by arrest or any other reason,

they would be replared by other persons coming from the same

aroa from which the original demonstrator had come.

Reverend Osburn emphasized that it was belleved

this would be the last chance to prove non-violent demonstrations

couiü be ellective in obtaining concessions on civil rights

matters.

Reverend Osburn stated if that effort failed, black

nationalist groups would take over the leadership in civil

rights matters.

In connection with that situation, Reverend.

Osburn remarked, "Let's hope this works".

Bibler and Bristol, in their talks to the group

attending the workshop, added nothing new, but supported the

siatimonts made by Reverend Osburn. All three speakers made

frequent favorable references to Martin Luther King.

It was determinad that Bristol anticipated there

would as a Cincinnati, Ohio, group participating in the

Washinston, D.E., demonstration.

Bibler

Fointed out what he believed the civil

rights moverint had to accomplish to

• be effective.

Bibler

listed those as follows:

1. Gather information

2. Education of poople.

3: Negotiations.

Confrontation and demonstration

5. Reconciliation.

Bibler was somewhat critical of peace groups and

ndicared he felt they had not accomplished anything.

During the workshop, it was brought out that there

Iwo main loints involved in the technique of civil disobed...nce.

1. Non-cooperation with an unjust law.

2. Non-cooperation with a just law to emphasize

an unjust situation not regulated by law.

Bristol pointed out that the technique of blocking

traffic was a case in which the traffic laws were just, but

could be used to emphasize a situation involving an

unjust

22w.

It was mentioned that as a technique, the demonstrators

is Washington, D. C., could tie up traffic. That could be

arcomplished without breaking a law, because while there are

laws which require a person to obey a stop light, there are no

laws requiring a person to drive on the green light.

A brochure, "Training In Non-Violence," published

by the fellowship of Reconciliation, was available

at the

worksho;. A bookiet, "Theory and Practice of Civil Disobedience,"

by Arthur Harver, Centerbury, New Hampshire, also was avail-

able, and a charge of fifty cents for that booklet was requested.

The workshop concluded at approximately 10:30 p.m.

on January 20, 1968.

Most of the persons present indicated

they would inturn for the meeting on January 21, 1968, inas-

much as many of the twenty-six individuals present appeared

to be Ohio State University students.

On January 19, 1968, Pat Shafer had emphasized

that selection of individuals to attend the workshop on January 20

and %1, 1968, should be done with great care, and persons

attending would be expected to have the ability to return to

their own areas and hold workshops on non-violence.

"The Southern Patriot" was cited as an "organ"

of the Southern Conference for

• Human Welfare (SCHW) by the

committee on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 12,

194?.

The SCHW was cited as a

communist front by the

Committee on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, on

June 12, 1947.

An amendment to the charter of the SCH dated

April 26, 1946, changed the nare of that organization to the

scer and

listed iis purpose as being to improve the

= Jucsiional and culturai standärds of the Southern people

In cocordance with the highesi American democratic institutions,

irisitions, and ideals.

The SCEF is self-described as having deep roots in

th. South where it began as the educational wing of the SCHw,

organized in 1938 to work for

economic and political reform.

When the SCaw disbanded in the late 1940's, SCEF continued as

an independent organization, rallying support for integration

and denocracy and helping to stimulate and nurture new

novements of the early 1960's.

The SCEF maintained head

quarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but in 1966 moved its

headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A source advised on March 2, 1961, that Claude

Lightloot, a Communist Party Functionary, stated at a meeting

o; the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,

1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any

progiessive movemani, but indirectly they do have some

influence in the SCEE.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases

of Communist irty activity in the New Orleans area, advised

on June 8, 1S6t, that during the time that the SCHW was.

in ezistence moubtes of the Communisi Party were members of

and worked actively in the SCil; however, since the formation

of ihe SCEF Communist Party members have

not been encouraged

to work in the SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is a

progressive liberal organization, which he considers a

Conmunist Party front organization because it has gone along

with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly on

the racial issue.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

BOURGET, engineer.

According to BOURGET, WOODALL has

indicated to him

that he is extremely "anti-MARTIN LUTHER KING"

and has agitated against KING in the past, in various locations.

WOODALL displayed a photo scrapbook regarding his picketing of

KING. Working with WOODALL at the hotel is one THOMAS FISHER,

born april y, 1937, residing at laly N. H. 66th

street, miam. Accordies to BOTHEr, FISTER appears to be a

supporter of KiNG rather than agitator.

ASHAUER stated that he has discussed this matter in

detail with Sergeant EVERETY KAY, Intelligence Unit, Miami'yo

Florida, Police Department, and every effort is being made

insure no trouble develops as a result of WOODALL's attitude

toward Dr. KING.

On February 6, 1968, ALPRONSO WOODALL telephonically

contacted the Miami Office of

the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation, to report that he is currently employed at the Four

Ambassadors.

He reported that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING will be

staying at the hotel in the near

future.

He went on to

relate that he had been questioned by members of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) Miami, Florida, if he

was going to picket Dr. KING when KING arrives in town.

WOODALL stated that he informed SCIC that he had no plans to

picket KING or to do anything against KING during KING's visit

to Miami.

On February 9, 1968, MM T-1, who has furnished

rellable information in the past, advised that ALPHoNSo WOODALL

is well known to him. He reported that wOODAlL is violently

opposed to all that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING stands for and

that it could be expected that WOODALL will attempt some type

of protest, during KING's visit to Miami.

MM T-1 reported

that he has no positive information in this regard, but will

be alert for any unusual activities on the part of

WOODALL.

MY T-1 reported that & close friend and associate

Of WOODALL IS THOMAS WASHINGTON,

a Negro male, described as

a "disciple" of ADAM CLAYTON POWELI.

He said

from the Liberty City section of Miami and is the type of

individual who would assist WOODAl in demonstrations against

DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

ALPHONSO WOODALL first came to the attention of

the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on July

11, 1967, when he telephonically advised that a group of

Negroes

were meeting at the Mary Elizabeth hotel, miami,

Florida. When contacted on July 31, 196%, WOODALL displayed

newspeper clippings concerning himself..

These articles

indicated that in April, 1967,

he picketed Dr. MARTIN

LUTHER KING in Cleveland, Onio.

He picketed KING because

of KING's stand against

the war in Viet Nam.

It was also

indicated in the clippings that he picketed KING because he,

WOODALL, had anl8 year old son who was killed in Viet Nam.

In January, 196%.

WOODALL Fas also quoted in these articles as

saying he was going to get STOKELY CARMICHAEL with violence

when he comes to Miami; however, CARMICHAlL has never come

to Miami.

It was also indicated that he threw a brick through

the window of Congressman ADAM CLAYTON POWELL'S campaign.

headquarters in New York City a few years ago. He hoped to.

get arrested and then expose the way POWELL was financing his

campaign for re-election to Congress. According to WOODALL,

they just repaired the window and never said anything.

When questioned concerning these articles,

'WOODALL stated that he never intended to commit any act

of violence if CARMICHAEL had come to Miami, but merely

intended to picket him as he had KING, and was misquoted

by newspapers.

On August 2, 1967, WOODALL telephonically contacted

the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at

about midnight. At this time, he appeared to be very upset,

and WOODALL stated that he had heard that MARTIN LUTHER KING

was going to come to Miami in the near future and that he was

going to again picket him.

He indicated that this picketing

would be of a peaceful nature.

WOODALL appears to become upset over information

concerning KING because of the death of his son in Viet Nam

and also because he has another son currently serving in

the United States

Army.

On the morning of August 4, 1967, HOODALL

telephonically contacted the Miami Office,

at which time

- 3 -

HH 55147 Do0Id:32989577 Page 408

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

he apologized for his being upset when he last called

the Office. He advised that he had received a letter from

his son, ALPHONSO WOODALI, IR., who is currently in the

United States Army and due to go to Viet Nam.

He stated that when he heard that KING was

coming he became upset, recalling his anti-Viet Nam war

stand.

He advised that if he picketed KiNG, It would

be of a peaceful nature and according to the laws or the

City. of Miami.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable al

and that the situation there is the

However, the source was

unable to ascertain clarifying information about the

situation in Philadelphia that Rutherford referred to.

The source continued that Rutherford advised

evison that the situation in washington,

D.C. was confused.

He noted that they (SCLC representatives) held a couple

of meetings

"with Rap Brown and his commandos occupying

that "the with walkie talkies and bodyguards"

• He added

invaded this church and took it over. They

wouldn't Let people in."

He said that "they" threw the

press out of the meeting and that "they walked out of the

meeting,

disrupted it, occupied the church, and literally

kept SCLC Board members out."

The following morning,

according to Rutherford, a picture of Stokely Carmichael

appeared on the front page of the "Washington Post"

Rutherford related that the day following the

stated that he told Stokely (Carmichael) that he, Rutherford,

wanted to hear what stokely had to say and that stokely

gave some "mealy-mouthed excuses" that did not stand up.

Rutherford also noted that he told Carmichael that "these

men told us" that they are interested in the total

destruction of the United States.

Levison commented that he had heard stokely say

this and Rutherford's comment was that "this is what

Rap (Brown) said last

night"

• Rutherford continued

that stokely is now

"sweet as pie.

He pulled a power play

on us in Washington".

, but did not win anything because

everybody was opposing him.

Levison commented that he could not see the SCLC

letting ten persons who threaten violence take over from

hundreds.

He described it as a dangerous thing, a king of

black facism.

Rutherford, in referring to the meeting, related

that a person named

Courtland (phonetic), whom he described

as naving been with the congress of racial Equality, made

the statement that "they" would not support "our campaign"

in washington, D.C., but would not participate in any

He said this is

"their whole life", that

although they could not take part in sometning they do

not believe in, even though they have trouble from their

constituents, they would not oppose it because anything

that leads to liberation is worthwhile.

Rutherford said that King became very upset after

chis private meeting and began berating him.

He said he told

"from them" was that they would not attemot to divide

the community.

He said

"they" were honest, that

"they"

stated that if the SCLC fails in Washington,

"we're going

to get a lot of new recruits" but if the SCLC is successful

"we are going to be in trouble".

He recalled that at

this moment King made a point, that if, "they" should

denounce the government, denounce the SCLe campaign and

criticize it, this would create an atmosphere within which

non-violence

would

have a better chance of succeeding.

He added that stokely responded that they have enough

problems, that there is enough confusion and division

in the black community, and that, if they should speak

out against King or what he is doing, people will not

know which way to turn.

Levison commented that he agreed with Carmichael

and disagreed with King on this point. He inquired as to

why King was upset.

Rutherford stated that King said the enemy was

violence and began to preach on how violence begets

violence.

Levison related

I that the key is that King states

the enemy is violence which is not true. The enemy are

the forces preventing

them from getting rights and violence

is one of the methods. He said that, therefore, they are

trying to develop a counter technique to violence.

in the war in Vietnam in Washington, D.C. on February

5,6, 1968, sponsored by the Clergy and Laymen Concerned

About Vietnam. It states that King addressed the gathering

of clergymen and laymen and told them that.

"it was imperative

that the freedom and peace movements be joined. Describing

the worsening economic conditions, he appealed to the

religious leaders to join and support the demonstrations his

organization has planned for Washington in April"

• The

article also notes that King made it clear that the targets

of the demonstrations would be the Vietnam war and Congress.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER

On february 7, 1968, a confidential source, who has

furnished reliable information in the past, advised that Doctor

Martin Lutherkking. JI.,. Of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, (SCIC) was scheduled to meet with Stokelym

and H. Rap. Brown of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

(SNCC) some

le time during the evening of February 7, 1968, at the

Pitts' Motor Hotel, 1451 Belmont Road, N. W.,. Washington, D. C..

The February 8, 1968, edition of the "Washington Post

and Times Herald," a daily Washington, D. C., newspaper, reported

that King had met with leaders of the SCLC and SNCC on the night

of February 7, 1968. Among SNCC representatives who reportedly

met with King was H. Rap Brown.

Later during the evening of February 7, 1968, King

attended a mass meeting at the Vermont Avenue Baptist Church,

• 1630 Vermont Avenue, N. W., Washington, D. C., which was sponsored

by the SCLC.

Several confidential sources, who have furnished

reliable information in the past, advised there were between 800

and 1,000 persons attending the meeting of which approximately

one hundred were white.

The meeting was presided over by Reverend Jefferson

Rogers, of the Church of the Redeemer, 15th and Girard Avenue,

N. E.,

, Washington, D.C.

King was the main speaker; however,

several others made short presentations to the group prior to

King's arrival. Among these speaking to the group were:

King was introduced by Reverend Jesse Jackson, SCLC

representative from Chicago, Illinois. King spoke for approx-

residents for the WSP. He did not discuss specific plans for

,the WSP but did describe it as a "wait in" with the indication

that the demonstrators would remain in Washington until satis-

factory results were obtained.

King stated the "hard core poor" would come to

Washington for the project and would continue the demonstration

until some type of action was taken by Congress, assuring them

of jobs or income.

King indicated no violence was planned for the project

but did state that whatever action necessary would be taken to

RACIAL MATTER

Reference is made to Chicago memorandum of

February 2, 1968, under the caption,

"Washington Spring

Project (WSP), Racial Matter," which in part reflected that

Martin Luther

King, Jr. was

to be in Chicago on that date

where he was to appear as a speaker for the West Side

•Organization (WSO), a small West Side Civil Rights group

in Chicago.

On February 5, 1968, a confidential source,.

which collects intelligence information in the Chicago area,

advised that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President, southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), headquartered in

Atlanta, Georgia, had arrived in Chicago at 11:20 a.m. on this

"date from Atlanta, via Delta Airlines Flight 614.

King was

accompanied by scLe officers, Reverend Andrew Young and

Reverend Ralph Abernathy.

A second confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised on February 5, 1968,

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

i POSSIBLE RACIAL INCIDENTS

DURING DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION,

INTERNATIONAL AMPHITHEATRE,

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS,

AUGUST,

1968

that King was in Chicago at this time generally to provide

impetus to the local organizing efforts in behalf of the

WSP, a program whereby the SCLC plans to mobilize large

numbers of persons in Washington, D.C. during April, 1968,

to protest United States Government

failures to solve the

problems of the

wash de poor.

In this connection King reportedly planned to met with

George Wiley, believed to be from New York City, and who is

head of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO).

The

NWRO is currently holding a three-day convention in Chicago.

According to this source, Wiley was at a recent

meeting in New York City, New York, where

support for the

WSP was solicited by SCLC personnel; however, Wiley would not

agree to participate in this SCLC project.

King's contact

with Wiley in Chicago, therefore, will represent an effort to

persuade him of the importance of lending his support to the

WSP.

This source, as well as the first source, advised

King has no known public appearances scheduled while in

Chicago other than a press conference to be held sometime

during the late afternoon or evening of this date.

King is

also not known to have any meetings scheduled with the local

SCLC staff; however, it was expected that in all probability

"he would meet individually with some key local personnel

in connection with the WSP.

No information was

available to either of the

above sources concerning King's departure plans from Chicago,

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

During the first week of the "Washington Spring

Project" calls will be made on Congressmen by demonstrators

from 17 different areas. During the second week of the

campaign the demonstrators will call on the heads of

departments such as the Secretary of Labor. On the first

visii the demonstrators will make their demands known and

on the second visit, if the demands are not met, a sit-in

will be conducted.

With respect to the individuals referred to

above it is noted that Stanley Levison was a secret member

of the Communist Party, USA, in July, 1963. In late 1963

and early 1964 he criticized the Conmunist Party for not

being sufficiently militant in the civil righis struggle.

Levison was described by the Conmunist Party leaders as

being to the "left" of the Communist Party in his position

on civil rights.

His differences with the Communist Party,

however, are merely tactical and he continues his ideological

adherence to communism. Stanley Levison is the owner and

operator of the Park Management Realty Company, 1841 Broadway,

New York, New Jock.

In March, 1944, the name Harry Wachtel was on a

list of names, significance not known, which was maintained

at the headquarters of Kings County Communist Party, Brooklyn,

New York. At that time the name of Leonora Wachtel, wife of

Harry Wachtel, and her address were listed on a list of names

of newly elecied officers of the Bath Beach Club of the Kings

County Communist Party.

On F'ebruary 26, 1957, a source identified a

Photograph of Clarence Jones as a person whom he knew during

leadership in the Labor Youth League.

The Labor Youth League has been designated

subversive pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

During the early 1940s Bayard Rustin was a member

been designated subversive pursuant to Executive Order

10450. The records of this Bureau's Identification Division

contain the following arrest record for Bayard Rustin:

On January 12, 1944, he was arrested for violation

of the Selective Service Act and on February 17, 1944,

received a sentence of three years. On September 15, 1948,

he was arrested in New York City on a disorderly conduct

charge and was sentenced to 15 days. On January 21, 1953,

he was arrested at Pasadena, California, for offering to

engage in an act of sex perversion of a homosexual nature

which he admitted and for which he was sentenced to serve

60 days.

In addition to the above, it has been reported

that the Communist arty of Cleveland, Onio, is showing

an interest in King's "Washington Spring Project" and members

thereof have expressed the opinion that every Communist Party

member in Cleveland should do all he can to contact people

in various groups and through organizations to urge them

to take an active part in the proposed demonstrations.

This meeting was presided over by King who restated

what he had said in the meeting mentioned earlier.

In addi-

tion, he said there were people in the audience who did not agree

with the planned WSP and asked that these people not hinder

the project even though they were not in agreement.

•

King reminisced about past demonstrations and projects

of the SCIC and their effect.

Doctor King advised they expected approximately

3,000 persons to come to WDC for the WSP. They plan to camp

on the Washington Monument or the Lincoln Memorial grounds.

They fully expect to be asked to move and when this is done

it will draw desired attention to themselves and their cause.

No mention of militancy or civil disobedience was made and

King indicated they would move their camp when asked to do so.

King indicated there would be similar demonstrations

in other cities during the same period of time as the WSP. He

did not identify these cities.

An announcement was made of a mass neeting of the

SCIC at the Vermont Avenue Baptist Church, 1630 Vermont

Avenue, I. W., WDC, on February 7, 1968.

The meeting ended at approximately 11:00 p.m.

RE: WASHINCTON SPRIN& PROJECT

On January 26, 1968, Confidential Informant T-1

advised that the weekly

meeting of the Alabama Christian

Movement for Human Rights- (ACMHR) was held on January 22,

1968, at St. Luke's ANE Zion Church, 3937 12th Avenue North,

Birmingham.

Albert Turner, Field Secretary, State of

Alabama, for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) made a speech to the two hundred persons who were

in attendance.

Confidential Informant I-l stated that Albert

Turner made a plea for 300 Alabamians to prepare to go to

Washington to take part in the Washington Spring Project

this April.

Turner said that Negroes must join in with

Dr. King because the SCLC is at a very low ebb and in danger

of a takeover by Black Power advocates. Turner made known

that he came to Birmingham from Detroit where violent

forces

claim that last sumner's burnings were small compared to what

they plan to do this summer.

Turner said that if these forces

try to destroy Detroit, that the entire Civil Rights movement

will be lost and the leaders killed or put in jail. Turner

told the group that Rev. M. L. Kings Jr's. program of civil

disobedience does not call

for lying down'in the streets but

merely "sitting in."

However, Turner stated that participants

should be ready to be jailed.

Confidential Informant T-l advised in conclusion

that Albert Turner indicated that in the near future, Rev.

M. L. King, Jr., will hold a state-wide meeting in Birmingham

in support of the Washington Spring Project.

All sources used in this communication have

CV T-1 advised on December 3, 1967 that he

recently learned that during the week commencing

November er:

1967 the Southern Christian Leadershig

Conference (SCLC) held a retreat aù Penn Center, erogmore,

South Carolina, which was presided over by Rev.

LUTHER KING, JR., President of SCLC and was attended

by approximately 70 individuals comprising the headquarters

and field staff of SCIC.

• various facets of ScLo's plan to conduct massive non-

no or other oe urine.

Reverend KING outlined this plan to those attending

the retreat; namely, that it had been tentatively decided

that in the

forepart of February, 1960, he, together with

other officers of SCLC and in all probability leading

representatives of other Civil Rights organizations not

identified) would personally present to the secretary of

specific requests for prompt Congressional action

pertaining to employment, income, housing, education;

other matters which constitute major problems experienced

by ghetto people. In the event these requests do not

receive an immediate unequivocal commitment insuring '

prompt Congressional action, an immediate massive non

violent demonstration would commence in Washington, D. C.

This demonstration would be conducted py sell and invoive

adults from all walks of llle, including students and

school children.

If an effort is made by civil and/or

military authorities to quell this demonstration, simultaneous

demonstrations of identical magnitude would commence in

NTIAL

RE:

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

CV T-l was not aware of the identity of all the

"target cities" referred to by Rev. KING but he understood

Cleveland was one of the cities included.

CV T-I went on that according to Rev. KING that.

during the period prior to early February, 1968, one or

two SCIC staff members would be assigned to Washington,

D. C. and each of the "target citias."

It will be the

responsibility of these members to select in each community

up to 200 individuals who will serve as leaders for

demonstrations. This type of individual sought will be

unemployed Negro males, whose general economic status is

low that they could lose nothing by participating in the

proposed demonstrations.

After selection of these indivicuals

it would then be the responsibility of the SCLO staff member

through mass meetings, workshops or other procedures to

indoctrinate these individuals with SCLC's overall

objectives and technique

of non-violent demonstration.

Rev.--KING emphasized that the individuals so selected

should be Negroes, however, he said once each demonstration

is actually commenced the assistance of white persons

would definitely be accepted and possibly solicited.

Reverend KING acknowledged this progran of

demonstrations

was a very substantial undertaking for SCIC

to embark upon.

He said it was imperative that SCLo be

successful in this undertaking because otherwise not only

would it be embarrassed by a failure but failure itself

in a large sense serve as a victory for the "Black

Power"

groups.

In this connection, he said it would be

necessary to solicit the cooperation of "Black Power"

Leaders not identified in order that such organizations

would permit SCIO to conduct its program without inter

ference.

He said he was extremely concerned over the

probability that such interference might easily turn any

demonstration into a riot.

He declared that if such

situation developed in any one of the communities in which

SCLC contemplates demonstrating SCLC will immediately

cease 8ll its activity in that community.

During the retreat an appreciable number of

SCIC staff members expressed doubt that the cooperation

of the "Black Power" organizations could be obtained and

raised a question as to whether the selection of up to

200 individuals in various communities might not present

Reverend KING responded by statiig

he was most confident ne could obtain the desired cooperation

of "Black Power" leaders. He said he realized these people

did not agree with his methods or the activities of SCIC

but is confident they have sufficient respect for him to

listen to his requests. He glso said he was quite confident

Furthermore, he expressed optimism

that once the demonstrations commence there will be sufficient

sympathy on the part of the general public that SCLo will

will receive adequate financial support.

CV T-I subsequently learned that Rev. KING had

informed SCLC staff members that this new activity would

be called Washington Spring Project.

CV T-I also advised on December 19, 1967 that

he recently learned that various assignments

had been

made of SCLC members to various cities

in the United

States in connection with the forthcoming WSP and the two

being assigned to the Cleveland area were EDDIE OSBURN and

MIKE BIBLER.

initiating in early April, 1969.

In attendance were

approximately 35 individuals, who were SCLo staff members.

on January 17, 1960, CV T-1 also furnished

information regarding the SCLC conference held at Atlanta,

Georgia from January 15-17, 1968; source added that during

the conference, Rev. KING said there was no doubt that

the requests that would be presented to the various

government agencies would receive a non-committal type

response. Then 200 demonstratorspreviously recruited by

SCLO in approximately 15 communities will then commence

a massive non-violent demonstration in Washington, D. C.

In conjunction with the activity of the

approximately 3000 demonstrators in Washington, D. C.,

SCIC contemplates that in each community from which these

demonstrators come there will be sympathetic simultaneous

demonstrations.

These demonstrations will be participated

in by individuals who do not go to Washington, D. C. but

experience the same problems and seek the same solutions

as the demonstrators

SCIC intends that the

demonstrators will not be intimidated in their efforts

by injunctions or other legal measures designed to serve

as deterrents.

The demonstrators

will submit to arrest and

incarceration without bail, however,

the place of

an incar

cerated demonstrator will be assumed by another demonstrator.

Rev. KING felt the WSP would produce affirmative action

promptly on the part of Congress regarding jobs or income

for Negroes.

CV I-1 advised on January 10, 1960 that he

learned Rev. KING planned to visit the

VaTIOUS

target cities

in connection with the WSP during February and March,

1968

and his schedule indicated he would be in Cleveland on

February 24, 1968:

in Cleveland at present.

The other members of Rev. KING'S

staff who had been working in the Cleveland area have been

moved to other cities

throughout the

country.

CV T-I had also learned that Rev. OSBURN had

been out of town for some time as he had been attending

an SCLC conference in Atlanta along with 150 other people

bui that OSBURN returned to Clevelana on January 18, 1968.

OSBURN mentioned on his return that he would have to get the

"ball rolling" in Caveland on the WSP indicating that

nothing has been done as of January 18, 1968 to organize

this project.

CV 13 reported on January 25, 1908 that he

learned that following Rev. OSBURN's attendance at the

SCLC conference in Atlanta on January 15-17, 1968, be

returned to Cleveland but then made another visit

Atlants for additional instructions regarding Cleveland's

role in the WSP.

On returning again to Cleveland, Rev.

OSBURN indicated that his organization now planned to

recruit approximately 200 distressed people

in the ghetto

area of Civeland to particicate in the WSP in wasnington,

D. C.

These people who will be unemployed and have nothing

to lose would not have the funds to make this trip or to

stay in Washington, D. C. but SCLC will make money available

to them. Rev.

OSBURN went on that he planned to open a

storefront office at E. 79th and Hough area, cleveland,

Ohio, on January 26, 1968, which is in the heart of the

most depressed area

of Cleveland and

the center of the

Hough area riots.

In addition Rev. OSBURN plans to issue

a brochure in the near future setting forth the aims, etc.

of the wSP.

RACIAL MATTER

on January 11, 1968, a contidential source

advised he had learned that the Southern Christian

19g, & cutter

Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date concluded

a retreat which was held January 15, 1968 -

January 17, 1968, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church,

Atlanta, Georgia, of which Church Reverend Martin

Luther King, Jr., President, SCLC, serves as co-pastor.

This retreat was concerned with SCLC's Washington

Spring Project (HSP) which it contemplates initiating

early in April 1968.

In attendance were approximately

50 individuals, about one-half of whom were SCLC field

representatives fron various locations.

Reverend king pointed out he did not have

any desire that SCLC should have any friction with

"Black Power groups" during the course of its WSP.

He said the basic issue of the WSP was jobs or incone

and the validity of

this issue could not be argued by

"Black Power groups" or anyone else.

He said SCLC

would simply go about its business of implementing

the WSP.

Reverend King declared that in the event

SCIC is not successful awakening the conscience of the

nation to the urgent need for jobs or income through

the WSP the nation will subsequently have to admit that

SCLC made a substantial effort in this regard. In the

event of such failure, Reverend King said there could

be no question that the

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER

On January 17, 1968, a confidential source

advised he had learned that the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date culminated

a three-day retreat held in Atlanta, Georgia.

This

retreat was held in facilities of the Ebenezer

Baptist Church of which Reverend Martin Luther King,

serves as co-pastor and also

attended by approximately 50 individuals. Approximately

one half of the individuals in attendance were SCLC

field representatives fron various locations.

A

representative (identity not known) of the American

Friends Service Connittee attended this retreat.

Reverend King served as the presiding officer

at the retreat, the essential purpose of which was twofold.

First, to afford SCLC staff members opportunity to fully

understand the objective of the SCLC Washington Spring

Project, discuss anticipated problems and seek solutions

therefo. Secondly, to permit Reverend Ring to infuse

SCLC staff members with enthusiasm to participate in the

project in order that it will be a success.

An appreciable amount of time atthe retreat was

devoted to group discussions by the SCLC field representatives

who will recruit demonstrators to participate

in the Washington Spring Project. James Bevel,

former Director of Direct Action, SCLC, and

Hosea Villians, Director of Voter Registration

and Political Education, ScLe, actively participated

in these discussions.

Both Bevel and Williams have

had considerable experience in the area of Civil

Rights demonstrations.

Reverend King lectured several times

during this retreat concerning the overall purpose

Of SCLC's Washington Spring Project.

He pointed

out this project would be predicated on the issue

of jobs or income for Ghetto Negroes and impoverished

people of all races in the United States.

However,

he emphasized this would not solve all the problems

experienced by the Negro, particularly those

regarding Inequality and therefore the Civil Rights

Movement as a whole will have many things to achieve

as years go by.

Acquiring jobs or income for Negroes alone,

Dr. King declared, will be a noteworthy achievement

on the part of the Washington Spring Project, however,

he stressed that the jobs or the income obtained would

represent a mere fraction of that which America owes

the Negro throughout history. He said America owes an

incalcuable sum to the Negro

who throughout his long

years of involuntary servitude labored to build this

country.

Dr. King stated that the many problems of the

Negro and other poor people will not be solved under

a Capitalistic system.

Capitalism, he said, has no remedy

for the poor.

The ultimate aim of all aggrieved people

in the United States

can only be to accomplish a change

in the existing Capitalistic economy and Government.

le suggested this change might be to "some form of

Socialistic Government'

• Reverend King did not discuss

in any detail how or when the change he referred to

might be accomplished.

On January 17, 1968, during his closing

comments at this retreat Reverend King emphasized

to the SCLC staff that the forthcoming Washington

Spring Project will be one of the most difficult

tasks which it to date has undertaken and

accordingly challenged the staff to maintain itself

both willing and able in order that the project will

be successful.

Reverend King referred to how Jesus found

it necessary to send His disciples on various missions.

He told the members of the SCIC staif that they were

including national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for

the purpose of setting in motion forces for the establishment of

ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director,

stated that in Negro communities

the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist

centors and to solidify the Party base through the DCA.

source also advised in September, 1966, that DANIEL RUBIN, CPUSA

National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes the

DEA siould have a working-class outlook and be a mass organization

favorabie to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism, and in

April, 1967, advised that GUS HALu: CPUSA General Secretary,

indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing mass

resistance to the draft.

A third source advised in September, 1967, that JARVIS

TYNER was elected chairman of the DA on September 10, 1967, at

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

The following information has been supplied

by a confidential source of this Bureau who has furnished

reliable information in the past.

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, held a conference

with approximately 50 people in Atlanta, Georgia, from

January 15 through 17, 1968, to discuss plans for the

massive civil disobedience in Washington, D. C., which he

calls the "Washington Spring Project." This project will

commence in late March, 1968. King's representatives

will attempt to recruit 3,000 Negro people from the ghetto

areas in 15 "target

cities! throughout the United States

. to go to Washington, D. Co, this spring and demonstrate.

The recruiters are currently en route to their assigned

cities of will arrive there in the next four or five days.

The

conference did not resolve when those indi

viduals recruited to demonstrate would arrive in Washington, D.C.

King still plans on presenting his initial demands to the

Department of Labor. He also expects to make demands, not

resolved, on other Government departments.

-

King feels that his demands will not be met by

any Government agency and his massive civil disobedience

will then commence.. The demonstrators will be instructed

not to abide by injunctions or other legal

deterrents. They

will sleep in Government office buildings and submit to arrest

and jail. Other demonstrators will take the place of those

jailed.

- MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

King envisions that these demonstrations will

tie up all business in Washington, D. C., in a matter of

a few days. King hopes the news of these demonstrations

traveling throughout the Nation will touch off simultaneous

demonstrations in the other "target cities." Initially

the demonstrators will press for jobs and income; however,

King feels the peace issue will naturally become

involved

and much support will be afforded the demonstrators in

Washington, D. C., by various peace groups. Because of • :

the demonstrations, King feels Congress will be forced to

pass legislation favorable to Negroes.

King plans to visit each "target city" and talk

to demonstrators recruited about the project and boost

morale. In that regard, King plans to visit Washington, D. C.,

on February 8, 1968. He also informed the conference he.

woüld be in Washington; D: C., for. the actual demonstrations.

The type of civil disobedience that the demon- .

strators would use was not discussed during this conference.

Even though King indicated that these demonstrations would

commence the last week in March, the source advised that

King has speaking engagements in several cities in Virginia

at that time. The source feels that the mass demonstrations

will not start until the first week in April.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

January 18, 1968

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On January 16, 1968, Lleutenant GEORGE FENCI, Philadelphia

POliCe Department, Civil Disobedience Unit, advised that on

January 11, 1968,

JAMES ORANGE, who was associated in some. way with.

Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING and the

Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC), was identified in Philadelphia and surveilled

throughout the day.

It was determined by the surveillance that

ORANGE was staying at 0540 Lincoln Drive, Philadelphia, which was the

residence of DI. ROBERT ANDERSON, no further identified by the

Philadelphia Police Department at this time.

During the evening hours, ORANGE went to the Universal

Church of Restoration at Gorgas Lane and Stenton Avenue in Philadelphia.

ORANGE and another individual went into the rear of the church. A

Ilst of license plates of other individuals', automobiles who entered

the church that evening was obtained by the Philadelphia Police Depart

ment.

The registered owners of these automobiles are being checked

by the Philadelohia Police Department.

About 11:30 P.M., ORANGE left the church with an unidentified

Negro male in a 1959 or 1960 Chevrolet, Tennessee License JJ8626.

This

license was subsequently determined to

be that registered to JAMES E.

WOODRUFF, 3211 Batavia Avenue, Nashville, Tenn. The Reverend JAMES E.

WOODRUFF is presently employed by the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania

in the Race Relations Section of the diocese. The Reverend WOODRUFF

is also the individual who was involved in the summer of 1966 with

the Liberation School in Nashville, Tenn., In which the Chief of Police

of Nashville, Tenn, alleged that the Ilberation School, which was

funded in part by the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity, was

teaching "hate whitey" classes.

ORANGE was observed driving a 1965 Pontiac sedan, Illinois

license KT3925, which later investigation determined was registered to

JAMES E. ORANGE, 1257 South Keeler Avenue, Chicago, Ill.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

When ORANGE returned to the residence at 6514 Lineuln

Drive around midnight, January 12, 1968, the surveillance was

dropped.

however as of mid afternoon

who has furnished reliable information in the past,

he had received unverified information that an individual

identified only as ORANGE had been at a mecting sometime around

the middle or latter part of December at the St. Thomas Episcopal

Church, 52nd and Pine Streets in Philadelphia during the evening,

meeting with civil rights leaders in Philadelphia.

It waS PA tol's

understanding that ORANGE represented Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING and

the ScId in regard to KING's coming project scheduled for the

spring of 1968 in Washington, D.t. and other cities. The gist

of the meeting was to the effect

that 1i Philadelphia civil rights

leaders were to support DI. KING's presence of SCIC in Philadelphia

sometime in early 1968, that any money collected through SCLO

¡efforts in Philadelphia would be used In Philadelphia rather than

being taken out of the city for the National Headquarters of SCLC

as had been done on a number of former appearances of Dr. KING in

Philadelphia.

PH I-I had no information as to whether or not this was

, accepted by ORANGE, SCIC, Or DI. KING. "

Enclosed for Bureau are ll copies and for Atlanta one

copy of an IHM of this date re captioned matter.

With respect to captioned matter, close contact has

been maintained by this office with racial

sources in Louisville,

Ky. and these sources, to date; have advised that they have re-

ceived no indication that activity re the captioned matter has

comnenced, other than the one meeting on 3-1-68, referred to

with respect to the captioned Project had commenced in Louisville,

such information would be known to the racial sources available

to this office. However, in view of the statement reported in

the enclosed, by MARTIN LUTHER KING's brother, Rev. A.D.

WILLIAMS. KING; that plans called for 200 people from Ky. to

participate in captioned Project, close contact is being main-

tained with racial sources to insure that any positive action

taken with respect to recruiting such individuals in Ky. will

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTERS

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., president, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced he will

conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign in the Nation's

Capitol the first week of April, 1968, in an effort to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorablé to the Negro.

on March 5, 1968, GOLDEN ASRO WRINKS, Field Secretary,

SCLC, was interviewed by Agent of the FBI at his residence

122 West Peterson Street, Edenton, North Carolina. FRINKS said

that he is pleased with the progress that Congress is making

with

leased with the

the proposed civil rights legislation, but he said that

even if legislation is passed, this will not change SCIC's

plans for a march on Washington, D. C. FRINKS pointed out that

DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING has not spelled out his demands as yet

and that they will include much more than just a housing law.

He suggested that one of the demands might be that all persons

are assured a ninimun income which would be paid by the Federal

government. His concept of this pian would be that the number

of days per year an individual is employed by private industry

would be subtracted from the total in the year and then the

government would pay the balance.

He said

that it would be the

government's responsibility to provide the work they wish these

individuals to do, even if it be only menial labor. He said that

it would also be the government's responsibility to enforce this

plan to insure that the persons are actually doing the work.

With regard to the march, he said that he has 21 paid

employees working for him throughout the State of North Carolina.

He said that these individuals are not being paid a salary but

subsistence only. He said that these people were unemployed

and that they had nothing else

to do, therefore they were willing

to work on that basis.

FRINKS advised he would provide the

numes of the 21 paid employees in about one week. He said he

did not have their names at the time of interview.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

FRINKS said that these 21 persons are recruiting others

to go to Washington, D. C., for the march and act as squad

leaders, guides, etc. for

the masses who will follow. He said

that his paid employees have a goal of 200 such persons and •

that 155 come ate, dy be recruited z ter the recou the

After the recruitment

payroll.

FRINKS said that he and his group of about 200 will

leave North Carolina on April 15 or 16, with a planned arrival

in Washington, D. C., on April 22, 1968.

Concerning transportation,

he said that the

means of transportation has not yet been worked

out.

He said he has

given consideration to buying old busses

or cars, but the busses especially do not seem to be available.

FRINKS said there has been

a suggestion to drive to a distance

of 100 miles south of Washington and then wall the rest of the

way.

There has also been the suggestion to walk the entire way.

FRINKS said he personally prefers to go by bus or car if possible,

stopping in the small towns en route.

He hopes to set up

tents

at night along the way.

He mentioned the town of Suffolk,

Virginia, as a possible first night stop. He commented that he

also hopes to set up tents in Washington, but he feels that they

will be prohibited from doing this..

Upon arrival at Washington, D. C., FRINKS believes that

Dr. KING will be there to meet them.

Shortly after their

arrival, he believes that KING will make his demands and then

call all Negroes to Washington who have grievances.

The hard

core group of squad leaders and guides will be stationed at

the entrances to the city and at the Federal buildings and

direct each incoming group to the office building that should

best be able to handle their particular grievance.

estimated that the demonstrations in Washington will last about •

three weeks.

FRINKS advised that he and Dr. KING are very much

concerned about STOKLEY CARMICHAEL and the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC) trying to interfere or take over

once the Negroes are in Washington.

He said CARMICHAEL'S

presence represents violence and the communist influence in the

civil rights movement. He said Dr. KING spoke with CARMICHAEL

during the last week in February and has a promise from him that

he will not interfere with the plans of SCLC. FRINKS advised

that KING plans additional talks with CARMICHAEL. FRINKS said

if he does come, "we will bust his head."

seeking impossible goals, and to get them to perform they are

being deliberately goaded into taking part in what is nothing

more or less than mob pressure to try to force action by the

Government. No Government, no matter the circumstances, car

attora to be Intimidated by moo action, and the beller is

growing that this is exactly what will happen when the extremist

leaders step in to take over after the initial "peaceful demon

stration" fails to accomplish its advertised purpose.

No information has been received from any sources

or local law enforcement intelligence agencies pertaining to

the Washington Spring Project.

individuals attended various smaller workshops to discuss

problems of the Negro living in the ghetto. A large amount

of time was spent discussing ways of putting economic

pressure on the white community to create more and better

jobs for Negroes,

The delegates were of variant opinions as to the

methods to be used in solving the problems within the civil

Martin Luther King, JI., President, Southern

c'9-ouea.

Christian Leadership Conference, held a week-long workshop

to train Negro ministers in urban leadership at Miami,

Florida, From February 19 through 23, 1968.

The Ford

Foundation recently gave King's organization a $230,000

grant to hold these workshops.

Approximately 150 Negro ministers throughout the

United States attended this conference. During the day these

individuals attended various smaller workshops to discuss

problems of the Negro living in

the ghetto. A large amount

of time was spent discussing ways of putting economic

pressure on the white community to create more and better

jobs for Negroes.

The delegates were of variant opinions as to the

methods to be used in solving the problems within the civil

rights movement. The majority of the delegates favored the

nonviolent approach. There were a few in attendance who were

desirous.of a more-militant approach: One of those advocating

a militant approach was Reverend James Bevel, an aide to King.

At one. point, Bevel stated he believed in burning down the

cities if something significant would be accomplished. He

did not believe in burning just for the sake of burning. He

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

advised he attempted to get Negro leaders in New York City

to burn that town down when Adam Clayton Powell lost his

congressional seat; however, he was unsuccessful.

Concerning religion, Reverend Bevel advised that

he did not believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. He

advised he was firmly convinced that "Mary" was raped by a

Roman soldier.

Another militant minister in attendance was

Reverend James E. Woodruff, an Episcopal minister from

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Reverend Woodruff confided to some in attendance

that he was the leader of a "'liberation school" and he also

conducted many classes in various homes in the Philadelphia

area. He also stated that he believed in terrorist tactics

to achieve black power.

Another source advised that there was a marked

tendency on the part of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference to move away from integration and to move toward

economic and political black power.

During the conference some members of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference attempted to gain support

for King's massive civil disobedience campaign to be held

early in April, 1968, in Washington; D. C. King calls this

• program his "Washington Spring Project." Most ministers in

attendance gave their reluctant approval to the "Washington

Spring Project" provided the Project would be approached

in a nonviolent manner.

Most of the delegates in attendance were opposed

to the militant approach to the problems of the civil rights

movement advocated by Stokely Carmichael, former Chairman of

the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. These indi-

viduals felt that the problems could be solved with a more

moderate approach.

now to soon lead a mass march on the National Capitol--to further

We are hopeful invasion will be dealt with in the manner

as the Bonas March some years ago -When our truly dedicated Veterans

of combat--Were driven from the Nations Capitol, with bayonets, torches,

and mounted troops--

There will also be millions across the Nation awaiting

to see how this agitator will be dealt with.

Surely, the "shanties" and "communism" will not be

permitted to blossom beneath those cherry trees, and in the shadows

of the Justice Dept. Bldg. An aroused country must be vitally conserned.

The caller made reference to a German lugar that

he wanted to kill MARTIN. LUTHER KING with and/or blow

up the hotel.

On February 21, 1968, BOB ASHAUER, Chief Security

call, however, on February 23, 1968, ASHAUER advised that

MALCHMAN had been eliminated as being responsible for the

anonymous calls threatening MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Refererce is made to communication from this Bureau

on February 21, 1968.

Inspector OWEN W. DAVIS, Metropolitan Police

Department,

Washington, D. C., presently on assignment in

Miami, Florida, reported

on February 22, 1968, that the

Ministers Leadership Training Program continues along

guidelines previously set out with little or no discussion

relating to the Washington Spring Project.

On February 21, 1968, the Miami Office of the

federad Bureau of Investigation received an anonymous

: telephone call from a male who inquired if the Federal

Bureau of Investigation was aware that MARTIN LUTHER KING

was in Miami, Florida.

The caller stated he intended to

kill KING and would like to bomb KING's room at the Sheraton-

Four Ambassadors Hotel, Miami, Florida, but feared injuring

other people.

Sergeant JOHN WEAVER, Miami, Florida, Police

Department, on duty at the Sheraton-Four Ambassadors Hotel,

reported on the evenicg of February 21, 1958, that the

swltchboard operator in the hotel received a

similar

anonymous call shortly before 8:00 PM on February 21,

1968.

The caller made reference to a German lugar that

he wanted to kill MARTIN LUTHER KING with and/or blow

up the hotel.

On February 21, 1958, BOB ASHAUER, Chief Security

Officer, Sheraton-four Ambassadors hotel, tentatively

•identified hotel guest HAROLD CHARLES MALCHMAN from Hyannis,

Massachusetts, as possibly being responsible for the anonymous

call, however, on February 23, 1968, ASHAUER advised that

MALCHMAN had been eliminated as being responsible for the

anonymous calls threatening MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Dear Sir:

It continues to be a mystery why our government allows a black

power leader the freedom to plan revolution.

If the White House and Justice Department "fear" the results of

Martin Luther King's April march on Washington and Carmichael's

Involvement in it why can't steps be taken to prevent this event?

It appears that we must fight communism in Vietnam, but not in

Washington D.C. Something is wrong!

Fear is growing among top offici-

als in the White House and Justice

Department that Dr. Martin Luther

King's April march of the poor on

Washington will result in a stun-

ning victory for Stokely Carmichael.

With only six weeks to go, little of

the detailed and massive planning

necessary for King's April campaign

has been done. Thus, in the opinion

, of Administration strategists, there

is a golden opportunity for Carmi-

chael to step in and gain primacy

among Negro leaders. Indeed, King

in desperation may even invite him

•to take a leading role in the

planning, with obvious implications

for the future.

But King,

never much of an

administrator, has nardly begun to

attack the mass of detail needed to

bring thousands of poor Negroes to

Washington

and

lead them. King badly misses Bay-

ard Rustin, chief planner for the

1963 march on Washington, who is

no estranged from King.

ment officials well know, King has a

'History" of surrendering control to

the better organized extremist ele-

ments in a critical situation. This

was precisely what happened during

the Selma, Ala., march in 1965 when

the Student Non-Violent Coordinat-

ing Committee (SNICK) forced King

to the wall and seized control.

Nor are Administration officials

alone in their apprehension. King's

more moderate lieutenants-such as

Walter Fauntroy,

chairman of the new Washington

City Council-have from the begin-

ning feared that control of the April

march would go to the extremists.

The decision by Carmichael's new

Black United Front to endorse the

"aims" of the King campaign has on-

ly fanned the fears. For Carmichael,

it avoids all responsibility for a pos-

sible fiasco but positions him per-

tectly to take command it the oppor-

tunity arises.

Indeed,

mere formation of the

Black United Front follows the Len-

inist line now followed by Carmi-

chael. Whether or not Carmichael

himself actually read Lenin during

his long travels in the Red world

last year, he returned to this coun

try a changed man. Once contemp-

tuous of non-radical Negroes, he im-

mediately proposed formation of the

Black United Front-a front of both

revolutionary and non-revolution-

ary elements along classic Leninist

Moderate Negro leaders here have

been uncertain about their reaction

Carmichael's

overtures.

Moultrie of the NAACP and Sterling

Tucker of the Urban League attend-

ed the first meetings of the front

more to keep an eye on Carmichael

than anything else. In a private con-

versation, Tucker told Carmichael

he realized each was trying to hood-

wink the other.

"But the moderates came under

heavy pressure not to consort with

Carmichael. Moultrie was particu-

larly chastised by national NAACP

headquarters. When the Black Unit-

ed Front met again last Wednesday:*

Feb. 14, neither Moultrie nor Tuck-

er' was present.

Present or not, they fully appre-

'ciate Carmichael's tactics. He is ex-

olicitly following Lenin's famed 1920

Injunction to the British Communist

Party not to attack the Labor Party

but to "support" the democratic So-

cialists "in the same way as the rope

supports a hanged man."

It is in precisely this way that

Stokely Carmichael may be able to

"support" - King six weeks hence.

The most charismatic and one of the

ablest Negro leaders,

Dear Sir:

It continues to be a mystery why vur governmen't allows a black

power leader the freedom to plan revolution.

If the thite House and Justice Department "fear" the results of

Martin Luther 'King's April march on Washington ard Carmichael's

Involvement in it why can't steps be taken to prevent this event?

It appears that we must fight communism in Vietnan, but not in

Dear Mrs. Philpot:

I have received your letter of February 6th and

certainly understand the concern which prompted you to contact

me.

With respect to the matter you mentioned, the

affording oi protection and the maintaining of order are not within

the scope of this Bureau's authority. The FBI is strictly an inves-

tigative agency of the Federal Government and, as such, does not

exercise any control over marches; demonstrations and similar

activities.

I want to assure you, however, that we in the FBI

will continue to discharge our duties with the highest degree of

thoroughness and dispatch in every area where we have an inves-

tigative responsibility.

Sincerely yours,

On 2/6/68 Mrs. Dorothe Matlack, Office of the

the Army, advised that on 2/5/68 Major General Roland del Mar

(U.S. Army, retired),

Apartment S-231, Washington, D.C., and whose telephone number

IS 554-7473, furnished the following information:

General del Mar said that he has been furnished •

information by a professional associate, whom he described

as a "friendly enemy" and with whom he maintains an armed

truce.

This associate, whom the General declined to iden-

tify

except to indicate that he is a fellow member of the

Council on Foreign Relations Study Group on U.S. Policy in

the Caribbean, has informed the General that when Martin

Luther King leads the April march in Washington, he plans to

rally on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court under the "Equal

Justice for All"'

engraving.

According to General del Mar's

source, there is a law which forbids this; therefore, King's

group hopes to be arrested.

The source advised that at the rally King will be

making demands for legislative action, giving Congress one

week to pass certain legislation. The source quoted King as

saying that,

"The Negroes are tired of Congress resting on

"Its dignity." According to the source, if the demands of

King's group are not satisfied within one week, they plan to

"burn Washington."

The source further said that King has not

really felt that he wanted to go along with H. "Rap" Brown but

that if King does not get his legislative demands in April,

he intends to join forces with those of Brown for all-out

violence. in the United States.

he recently attended conferences in Atlanta, Georgia,

other civil rights

workers from SCLC, Student Non-Vioient Coordinating

Committee (SMCC) and the National Association for the

of this conference was to plan demonstrations

He said

SCLC hopes to have immediate presage of certain civil

KING will call for

the possibility that the demonstration in Washington, D. C.,

might meet with resistance from the local Covernment,

FRINKS made no mention of other target cities."

He

said

if they are resisted in Washington, D. C., there will

be sit-ins and other forms of civil disobedience short of

violence. As to his role in this master plan, FRINKS

said it is his responsibility to train 200 persons

throughout this state to go to Washington, D. C., with

him and demonstrate at preselected locations.

As an

example, he used the Department of Interior as the

object of such a sit-in or demonstration by his group.

He said this group of 200 from North Carolina, would not

be from any or?

area of the state, but from every locality.

He said he would not want this group to meet unless he

called a meeting.

FRINXS felt that it they all came

from one area of

North Carolina, chances would be enhanced

that once trained, they might choose a violent course

of action rather than the

non-violent course he intends

to pursue.

Regarding violence, FRINKS admitted that

once the SCLC-sponsored demonstrations in Washington,

D. C., commenced, little could be done by SCLC to prevent

other groups from arriving in Washington, D. C., who

may be responsible for violence or riots.

FRINKS stated

he had

just returned from Ducham,, North Carolina, where

he had been working on the Washington,

D. C., project.

He stated he plans to return there about January 27 or 28,

1968, presumably both for responsibilities he has to

SCLC and REGINALD HAWKINS.

the Spring and Summer of 1968, to get action to aid Negroes

in the United States; KING gave no details of this project.

Donald F. O'Donnell, Chief Counsel of the Senate

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (chaired by Senator John L.

McClellan) which currently is conducting the hearings concerning riots

and civil disorders, has requested information concerning the demon-

stration being planned by Martin Luther King, Jr., in Washington this

spring. King has publicly stated that he intends to conduct massive

civil disobedience in Washington this year unless specific demands

for congressional action to solve the problems of poor Negroes are met.

Enclosed is a brief summary of pertinent information

concerning King's plans for this event. The information contained

therein is of a public source nature.

In addition to furnishing the enclosed write-up to

O'Donnell, it is felt we should keep the leadership in the House of

Representatives and the Senate advised of pertinent developments

concerning these demonstrations insofar as that they might affect

the Congress. Hence, it is believed a copy of the enclosed write-up

should be furnished to Speaker of the House McCormack and Senate

Majority Leader Mansfield for their information.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the enclosed write-up be approved and returned to

THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP

CONFERENCE PLANNED MARCH ON WASHINGTON

i t

At the 10th Annual Southern Christian Leadership

Conterence (SCht) in Atlanta, Georgia, August 15-11, 1906,

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Scue, spoke on August 15,

1:6%, urging a new drive be instituted to effect congressional action

to improve the life of the Negro in the United States. King said this

drive should include massive civil disobedience such as strikes, school

boycotts and a camp-in in Washington, D. C., li demands were noi met.

The SCLC held a retreat from September 12 to 17, 1967,

at Wacrenton, Virginia. King had announced the purpose of the retreat

would be to plan massive civil disobedience in several major cities

throughout the country.

In addition to the various SCLC staff members and

personnel, attending the retreat were Joan Baez, nationally known folk

singer and Vietnair war protestor, and Stanley Levison, one of King's

principal advisors who has been identified as a long-time secret

metaber of the Communist Party. (See remark of Senator James O

Maaland in the Congressional Hes dor July 2l, 1666)

15+- 8428500

An agreement was reached at this meeting to demand

legislation to guarantee jobs or a minimum income for poor people.

These demands would be presented in conjunction with a march on

Washington, D. C., in the Spring of 1066. The riarch would be organ-

ized by SCLC with participants recruited from the ghettos all across

the country and from rural areas in the South. If the march did not

produce the desired congressional comitment, massive civil

disobedience would be undertaken in Washingion and other major cities.

In the late Fall of 1967, SOLC held a retreat at

Frogmore, South Carolina, where specitic plans were made dottstaning

the group will be given no definite assurance of any positive action

and the program of massive civil disobedience then will begin.

Various reports indicate these activities may include attempts to

block the entrances to major government buildings and to disrupt trans-

portation facilities in and around the Nation's capital. Simultaneous

disturbances may be undertaken in various other cities around the

country.

King has announced that he is sending recruiters to

a number of cities and areas in the country to organize leadership

for the demonstrations. Cities where recruiters would be sent

include Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Louisville, Los Angeles,

Milwaukee, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh,

washington, Cincinnas, Cleveland, Akron, Toledo; Richmond and

Petersburg, Virginia. in addition, leaders are to be recruited in

the rural areas of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North and South

unequivocal commitment for prompt Congressional action.

If an effort is made to stop the Washington, D. C.,

demonstrations, simultaneous demonstrations will commence

in 15 other major cities throughout the United States.

In the interim SCLC will assign one or more staff

members to Washington, D. C., and other cities to select

and

train leaders for these demonstrations. It is King's

desire to train approximately 200 leaders in each of these

cities who in turn will recruit individuals to participate

in these proposed civil disobediences. The above-referenced

Atlanta airtel sets forth the name of

the cities involved

and, where known, the identity of individuals who will

participate in this regard.

In view of the above, recipient offices are to

advise the appropriate local authorities of these current

plans of SCLC. At that time, close liaison should be

established with these agencies so that any information

In this regard received by them will be immediately

furnished your office.

In addition, youshould alert your ghetto

informants to this matter and instruct them to immediately

advise you of the activities of the SCLC representatives

in your division. If you do not have ghetto informants

or sources in your division that can furnish this type

of information, you should immediately take steps to

remedy this undesirable situation.

Recently, King has announced to SCIC staff

members that this new activity will be called "Washington

Each recipient office should open a case

desire to train approximately 200 leaders in each of these

cities who in turn will recruit individuals to participate

FOR RELEASE WHEN DELIVERED ON FLOOR OF THE SENATE

REMARKS OF SENATOR JOHN L. MCCLELLAN

RELATING TO THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON

willial

Mr. President, the so-called "Poor People's March on Washington"

Is a matter of deep concern to every law abiding citizen of our country.

The stated intentions of the leaders of the march are to

assemble in this city many thousands of demonstrators--no one seems to

know how many there will be--in an atmosphere and under conditions which

are calculated to lead to civil disorders and violence. I quote one of

their leaders, the Reverend A. D. King, brother of the late Martin Luther

King, speaking on April 21, 1968: "We are going to Washington and

disrupt Washington so it cannot function unless it does something about

black people." On May 2, Reverend Abernathy, in addressing an audience

in Memphis, stated 'we are coming to Washington to turn Washington

downside up and upside down." There have been other serious threats

which were obviously intended to intimidate and coerce important officials

of the government.

On April 25, 1968, less than two weeks ago, the Senate

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a conference with the'

officials of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments to discuss

this March on Washington.

Present at the conference were members of the Subcommittee and

the following Federal officials: Attori-y General Ramsey Clark; Secretary

of the Interior Stewart.I. Udall; Under Secretary of the Army David

McGiffert; General Ralph E. Heines, JI., of the U. S. Army; Major General

Charles I. Southward of the National Guard; and Major General William P.

Yarborough of U. S. Army Intelligence. Distriet of Columbia officiale

who attended sere Mayor Waltar Washinston, Directop of Public Safety.

AH 55147

The purpose of the conterence was to ascertain what polleles

and procedures these governmental agencies propose to follow in prevestire,

controlling or supervising this demonstration. Specifically, we wanted

to learn what actions had been taken or would be taken to maintain law and

order in the District of Columbia during the march, to assure that the

orderly processes of government will not be disrupted, or halted, to

protect the citizens of

the city from physical harm and their property

from damage and destruction, and to prevent the outbreak of violence as

a consequence of the mass demonstrations which have been announced.

All of us are aware, through our mail and telegrams, that the

nation is deeply disturbed about the possible consequences of this march.

Our people have a right to know whether the government is making the

preparations necessary to avert another period of violence in our

nation's capital, or whether there is procrastination on the part of

responsible heads of government. We would like to know whether needed •

and firm decisions are being deferred

and unduly delayed during this

period of tense conditions in the wake of the recent rioting. The city

has had more than 50 instances of suspected arson since April 15.

In my opinion, the President of the United States bas the

obligation and responsibility to announce promptly and firmly to those

who are coming to Washington to participate in the demonstrations,

that lawlessness, disruption of goveranent, and incitement to rioting

and violence will not be tolerated. The time is getting short; the

marchers are already on the way. Word from the President should go out

immediately to the entire nation that the Government of the United States

in Its capital city will not be subjected to intimidation, humiliation

and disruption, and that any attempt at violence, rioting, burning and

plundering in the city of Washington will be promptly met with such

force as may be necessary to prevent or to quell such acts.

All American citizens have the right to peacefully petition

and officials for the redress of grievances, ard such

presented should be heard and appropriately acted upon.

permitted to employ intimidation and coercion or to resort to civil

disobedience and violence to impose its will or to achieve 1ts aims.

If this is tolerated, law and order will be destroyed and a safe and

peaceful society will surely perish.

In his press conference of May 3, the President acknowledged

the dangers attending this march. When he was asked about the march

by a news reporter, he made the following comments about the possibilities

of violence: "We hope that the presentation made will be nonviolent

although WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT NO SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. CAN GIVE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THEY CAN CONTROL A SITUATION LIKE THIS. IT CONTAINS MANY

INHERENT DANGERS. We are concerned with them. We have made extensive

preparations." Most regrettably, however, the President failed to take

advantage of the opportunity in his press conference, on nationwide

network television and before the assembled White House press corps,

to sound a firm warning to the marchers, and especially to their leaders,

and to give positive assurances to the American people that civil

disobedience, rioting, looting and burning will not be tolerated--that

such force as may be necessary to deal with violence effectively will

be positively and promptly used.

Mr. President, the Subcommittee today is releasing the

transcript of the conference of April 25 so that the public can be fully

informed and alerted to the dangers that are inherent in this impending

demonstration under a leadership who, as I

stated previously, have

announced that they are coming here to "turn Washington downside up and

upside down."

The Artorney General was urged by the Subcoumittee to seek

redress in the courts by injunction to prevent the marchers from resortins

to violence and civil disorders. The many public statements made by tha

leaders of the march alone would warrant the granting of such injuncern.

We are, or should be, a people of law and order. The government airuis

make use of the remedies that are available to it. It should invoke lie

H# 55147 DooId:32989577 Page 838

## Page 839

power of the courts to enjoin and prevent the threatened disorders and

Iawlessness In our nation's capital. It Is of the utmost importance

that all possible steps be taken to meet the dangers and challenges this

impending march imposes.

The transcript of the conference makes clear that some of the

Important decisions have not yet been made and that adequate planning 1s

far from complete. For example, we do not know where the marchers will

be allowed to build their "shantytown," because that decision has not

been made, or 1f made, has not been announced. The statements of

Secretary Udall indicate that the decision about the granting of a

permit for a "shantytown" will be a policy decision made in conjunction

with other high level authorities. Does this mean that the decision

and responsibility for permitting the building of a "shantytown" will be

In the white House? Will the marchers be permitted to pitch their tents

and build their shacks on the Mall or on the grounds around the Washington

Monument? We do not know, because we were informed in the conference

that no application for a permit had been submitted and no decision bad

yet been made.

I have also been advised by Secretary Udall that as of this

morning no request for a permit had been submitted. However, I read in

this morning's paper a statemet by a leader of the march that they

propose to utilize Federal property of their choosing without a permit

and without having requested a permit.

Apparently, the leaders of this march intend to defy the

authorities and deliberately violate the law for the purpose of provoking

an incident. In my opinion, this is contrery to every proper concept

of peaceful assembly. Instead, it is a premeditated act of contempt for

and rebellion against the sovereignty of government.

It is also clear that no one in authority knows how many persons

are coming or exactly where they are coming from. There may be 100,000

demonstrators on the streets on Memoriel Day, May 30, according to

estimates of the march leaders themselves.

. 8.

I sincerely believe that a positive and unequivocal warning

to that effect should be given to the marchers and their leaders who are

making dire threats of what they intend to do when they get here, and

such reassurances should be given to the entire nation by the President

himself, so the American people can know that this city is not faced

with shame and disgrace because of lack of purpose and determination

on the part of our government to prevent 1t.

The probability of violence exists, Mr. President. Indeed,

there is reliable inforuation that it is actually being planned by certain

militant advocates of violence who will swarm along the marchers'

routes and will move into the "shantytowys"when they are erected.

During the conference, I asked the Attorney General if he

had information that militants are plotting now to cast aside the

Reverend Ralph Abernathy and take over the mass demonstrations once

the marchers reach Washington.

He said that he was not familiar with

any such information.

The Subcommittee has received sworn Information that this 1s

actually being planned, and this information comes from within the

militant movement itself. There are militant leaders, now on the road

or ready to march with their followers towards Washington, who have

boasted to their followers that, once they arrive here, they will control

their own groups and Incite them to rioting and violence. They are

bragging that they will not leave Washington without new wardrobes

-

which they will acquire when the looting starts. They say that some

of their group will be armed with switch-blade knives and hand guns.

Some of the men who are doing the planning and making these

threats are given to violence and have criminal records.

Some of them

have been charged with serious crimes. One of them said in a meeting

of his group, "The only good white man is a dead white man," and "pick

to commit large numbers of troops to the city at very short notico to

The Subcommittee has evidence, Mr. President, that certain

militant leaders of marchers have announced in secret meetings that it

is their intention to carry out the following objectives:

1. They will build a "shantytown" on the Mall whether or not

they have a permit to do it.

2. They will prevent Senators and Congressuen from reaching

their offices by accosting them on the streets of Capitol Hill, and

they do not intend to obey the laws which prohibit demonstrations and

disorder on Capitol Hill.

3. They will place children in the forefront of demonstrations

in order to gain publicity about "police brutality" whenever the police

or the Aruy are required to control crowds and stop law violations.

4o They will obtain new clothing and other merchandise when

the looting starts.

5. They will carry weapons.

6. They will not post bond for their followers who may be

arrested s0 that the jails and other detention centers will be fillea

and will stay filled, and thus the District will be unable to remove

and detain masses of law violators.

7. They will incite demonstrators to violence and rioting.

Io prevent these things from happening, I would most respect-

fully suggest and urge that the President issue

a firm and unequivocal

warning to the marchers and reassurances to the public, in words so plain

and positive that they cannot be misunderstood, that violence, looting,

arson or the disruption of civic order and the functioning of government

will not be tolerated; that this city will not be turned "downside up

The Subconmittee has evidence, Mr. President, that certain

nilitant leaders of marchers have announced in secret meetings that it

Is their intention to carry out the following objectives:

2. They will build a "shantytown" on the Mall whether or not

they have a permit to do it.

2. They will prevent Senators and Congressuen frow reaching

their offices by accosting them on the streets of Capitol Hill, and

they do not intend to obey the laws which prohibit demonstrations and

disorder on Capitol Hill.

3. They will place children in the forefront of demonstrations

In oider to gain publicity about "police brutality" whenever the police

or the Arwy are required to control crowds and stop law violations.

4. They will obtain new clothing and other merchandise when

the l00ting starts.

5. They will carry weapons.

6. They will not post bond for their followers who may be

arrested so that the jails and other detention centers will be filled

and will stay filled, and thus the District will be unable to remove

and detain masses of law violators.

7. They will incite demonstrators to violence and rioting.

To prevent these things from happening, I would most respect-

fully suggest and urge that the President issue a firm and unequivocal

warning to the marchers and reassurances to the public, in woras so plein

- and positive that they cannot be misunderstood, that violence, looting,

arson or the disruption of civic order and the functioning of governrent

will not be tolerated; that this city will not be turned "downside up

and upside down;" that law and order definitely will be maintained, and,

disobedience, violence, Insurrection, and humiliation, whatever force

"If the police dogs and fire

Tenn., can't," he told the dis-

Pleading for unity, Dr. King

said:

"We have got to stay

together and maintain unity.

We have to keep the issues

where they are supposed to be.

The issue is the refusal of

Memphis to be honest with its

public servants who happen to

be garbage men."

Dr. King said the violence

that erupted during last Thurs-

day's mass march caused at-

tention to focus on the "broken

Demonstration Erupts

In an instant last week, a fairly orderly demonstration

in support of the sanitation strike degenerated into an'ugly

outbreak of looting and rioting, bloodshed and pillage. A

great part of the downtown area and the southwestern part

of the city were in a state of near martial law after police,

firemen, state troopers and the National Guard were

called to queach the frenzy.

Observers agreed the violence started when dozens of

Negro youths bolted from the pack on Beale Thursday and

started breaking windows and looting. That set off a

12-hour spell of violence that saw one Negro youth slain,

scores hurt and more than 300 arrested.

Dr. Martin Luther King, in town to lead the demon-

stration, was quickly whisked away when the disturbance

started. As it continued over a great area of the city, fires

were set, bombs were tossed and police and firemen were

harassed continuously. Determined guardsmen warned all

persons olf Beale Street, literally wrecked in the melce.

Mayor Henry Locb quickly set down at 7p.m.-to-5 a.m.

curfew under posers granted by a law rushed through the

Tonnessee General Assembly the day of the nutbreak.

Liquorand beer sales were forbidden, as was the sale of

IN-THE ACTUAL strike itseif, efforts, to mediate it

appeared futile. Union leaders walked out of mediation

talks with city government representatives in the seven-

week strike before the talks moved past the first issue,

union recognition. The break-oti came as the third day of

talks was near an end.

The union walked out and officials charged Mayor

Henry Loeb in effect had tied the city committee's hands

on the crucial issue. Immediately, there were two versions

as to why the talks broke off — one from the city, another

from the union.

The union charged the biggest roadblock was a conten-

tion by the city committee that it had no power to agree on

anything — that only the rayor could. However the city

committee claimed the union demanded it first be recog-

exclusive bargaining agent before-any other

points at issue could be discussed.

THE NEWLY CREATED National Alliance of Busi-

nessmen (NAB) and Labor Department are hoping Mem-

phis metropolitan area businessmen will hire 600 hard-core

unemployables

by June, 1969, and 1,500 disadvantaged

youths this summer. Such was the goal outlined to a

meeting of about 100 businessmen.

William Norwood Jr., regional manpower director with

the Labor Department, was reluctant to quote exact fig-

ures. However, he said, "We, hope the response by the

business community will prove these target figures to be a

low minimum." The alliance, backed by the Labor Depart-

ment and headed nationally by Henry Ford II, will attempt

to find jobs for 500,000 hard-core unempioyables by June,

1971. The goal is 100,000 by 1969, and this summer the

alliance wants to find jobs for 200,000 disadvantaged

•youths, said Porter Grace Jr., president of Union Planters

National Bank and chairman of the Memphis Chapter of

- the Alliance.

THE CITY COUNCIL rebuffed Councilman Jerred

Blanchard and refused to suspend its rules to consider a

new resolution approving the presently planned rouie of

the east-west expressway, through Overton Park. The

move apparently delayed any action on the heated issue

for at least another week despite a report that Federal

Highway Administrator Lowell Bridweil will not approve

any east-west expressway in the "foreseeable future"

unless the council changes its position with a new resolu-

tion.

Meanwhile in Washington, it came to light that nation-

al conservation interests™

may file a suit to stop the

expressway through the park. Mr. Bridwell apparently

does not want to commit funds to the through-the-park

route in the face of a threatened suit without the solid

backing of the City Council here.

SHELBY COUNTY VICTIM No. 109 of the fighting in

Vietnam was claimed last week. Army Pfc. David

Derry of 4599 Sunnybrook was killed in Vietnam, the

Defense Department reported to his wife.

Private Derry, who was 18, was riding in a vehicle

which hit a land mine. The telegram did not say where.

His wife, Mrs. Marie Derry, received a letter from him

recently in which he said he was looking forward to seeing

his child - she is three months pregnant.

unemployables by June, 1969, and 1,500 disadvantaged

youths this summer. Such was the goal outlined to a

meeting of about 100 businessmen.

William Norwood Jr., regional manpower director with

the Labor Department, was reluctant to quote exact fig-

ures. However, he said,

"We, hope the response by the

business community will prove these target figures to be a

low minimum.'

" The alliance, backed by the Labor Depart-

to find jobs for 500,000 hard-core unemployables by June,

1971. The goal is 100,000 by 1969, and this summer the

Blanchard and refused to suspend its rules to consider

new resolution approving the presently planned rouïe of

the east-west expressway through Overton Park. The

move apparently delayed any action on the heated issue

for at least another week despite a report that Federal

Highway Administrator Lowell Bridwell will not approve

any east-west expressway in the "foreseeable future"

unless the council changes its position with a new resolu-

tion.

Meanwhile in Washington, it came to light that nation-

al conservation interests may file a suit to stop the

expressway through the park. Mr. Bridwell apparently

does not want to commit funds to the through-the-park

route in the face of a threatened suit without the solid

backing of the City Council here.

YOUTH IS SLAIN;

SCORES INJURED

Juveniles Spark Violence, Looting

As King Leads Strike March

Teams of police and National Guardsmen-patrolled trouble

spots over a major part of Memphis last night, as a stunned

city counted one death, more than 200 arrests and scores of

injuries in its first full-scale race riot.

More than 3,800 National Guard troops moved into the city

afternoon

and last night in the wake of rioting and

looting that left Main Street and historic Beale Street littered

with bricks,

blood and broken glass. Police last night were

unable to estimate the number of businesses looted. Liquor

stores in predominantly Negro areas were favorite targets of

the looters.

The rioting was touched off during a march down Main led

by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader and

Nobel

Peace Prize winner was hustled away from the down-

town scene as violence began to flare.

A tight curfew — probably the first in the city's history

since the Civil War — was imposed by Mayor Henry Loeb. It

uthorized police to question anyone on the streets between th

ours of 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. and arrest anyone without "legit

mate business or emergency reasons."

Negro leaders and Fire and Police Director Frank L.

orderly one, and the trouble started when a group of about 200

youths — many of whom 'appeared to have been drinking —

separated themselves

from the main body of about 5.000

marchers, and went on a windos-breaking, Iooting binge.

Many of them were black power advocates, several wearing

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

::On March 22, 1968, a press conference was called

by representatives of the Washington Spring Froject (WSP) at

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) Office,

1401 U Street, N.W., Hashington, D.C. (WDC).

At the conference which was atended by between

fifty and sixty people, it was announced that Dr. Martin Luther

King, JI., President of the SCLC, would arrive. in MDC on

April 22, 1968, to initiate the WSP by presenting his

requests

to the United States (U.S.) Congress. They expect

three thousand demonstrators to arrive in Washington in

support of Dr. King late in April or early May, 1968. They

stressed that the emphasis would be in the length of the

demonstration rather than the number of demonstrators to

come to VDC and indicated they do not expect more than five

thousand and may. limit the demonstration to that number of

people. They expect these demonstrators to remain in WDC as

long as necessary or until they get tired and return to their

homes.

They emphasized the fact that there are no deadlines

and the demonstration could continue past the summer months.

It': was announced that no site had been selected for

the "New City'' which will be erected to house the demonstrators.

They added their present desire is to have the location as

near the U.S. Capitol as possible. They added they do not

plan any type of demonstration inside the Capitol building;

however, demonstrators will be instructed to contact their

respective congressmen.

April 22, 1968, to initiate the WSP by presenting his

requests to the United States (U.S.) Congress.

They expect

three thousand demonstrators to arrive in Washington in

support of Dr. King late in April or early May, 1968. They

stressed that the emphasis would be in the length of: the

demonstration rather than the number of demonstrators to

come to WDC and indicated they do not expect more than five

thousand and may. limit the demonstration to that number of

people. They expect these demonstrators to remain in WDC as

long as necessary or until they get tired and return to their

homes. They emphasized the fact that there are no deadlines

and the demonstration could continue past the summer months.

It': was announced that no site had been selected for

the "New City" which will be erected to house the demonstrators.

They added their present desire is to have the location as

near the U.S. Capitol as possible. They added they do not

plan any type of demonstration inside the Capitol building;

however, demonstrators will be instructed to contact their

respective congressmen.

March 22, 1968

RE:

SANITATION WORKERS STRIKE,

MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE;

RACIAL MATTERS

On the night of March 21, 1968, Captain Jewell

Ray, Inspectional Bureau, Memphis,

Tennessee, Police

Department, advised that

the Police Department had learned.

reliably that Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., President/S

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLO) :

of Atlanta, Georgia, was due to arrive in Memphis,

Tennessee,

at 8:15 a.m., March 22, 1968, from Atlanta

on Delta Airlines for the purpose

of leading a mass

downtown march in support of the sanitation Workers

who have been on strike since February 12, 1968.

He was scheduled to leave Memphis at 3:15 p.m.,

March 22, 1968, to return to Atlanta.

Ray pointed out that it was snowing hard in

Memphis on the night of March 21, 1968, and that there was

& good possibility that King would be unable to arrive, as

it was indicated that flights would be cancelled in and out

of Memphis.

On the morning of March 22, 1968, Lieutenant

E. H. Arkin, Inspectional Bureau,

Memphis Police Department,

advised that due to the fact that 12 inches of snow had

accumulated in Memphis and four additional inches were

predicted before the end of the day, Reverend James Morris

Lawson,

Jr., one of the ministers leading the strike

sympathy demonstrators and who had promoted the proposed

mass march in downtown Memphis headed by King, had called

the Police Department and stated that the march had been

officially called off and that plans would probably be

made in the indefinite future for some future march,

although this was a matter of conjecture on Lawson's

part.

Arkin further stated that as of 8:00 a.m.,

only 20 people had shown un at Clayborn Temple, where

the march was scheduled to start, and that those people

had been told to go home.

The Commercial Apneal newspaper, Memphis,

resolution drafted by its Chairnen, Downing Pryor,

callins utor the city and the striking sanitation

unIon, the American

Federation of State, County, and

Municipal Employees. to

sit down "in joint and continuous

conference" in an effort to end the strike; that the

resolution asked that Frank B. Miles, Director of

Industrial Relations for the E. I. Bruce Company, a

large lumber company, Memphis, be accepted by both sides

a mediator.

Pryor was quoted by the paper as saying he felt

the resolution was acceptable to Mayor Henry Loeb and

also to International President Jerry Wurf of the Union,

with Councilman J. O. Patterson, Jr., male Negro, casting

the only dissenting

vote among

the 13 Councilmen.

Arkin added that sidelights to the strike of

possible interest were reilected in events of March 21,

1968, namely that a Mrs. Evelyn McCray of 1253 Englewood

had

been shooting inside the city limits on larch 21,

1.968

after she told police that she fired tuo shots into

her fir in an attempt to scare a man who was kicking over

She claimed that Leslie Robinson, age

41, of 1244 Englewood, a striking sanitation worker,

had

begun kicking her gerbage cans into the street after she

would not agree to stop putting them on the curb for

sanitation pickup.

She claimed that he cursed her,

threatened to burn her house down, and then started

kicking the cans, which were full

of garbage, into the

street; that she

went into the house, got a pistol, and

fired twice in an attempt to scare him.

She claimed that

he then told her he was going to get a pistol and shoot

her.

The nolice subsequently arrived and arrested

Robinson at his home, based on an assault warrant sworn

out by Mrs. McCray.

Mrs. McCray was also charged with

shooting inside the city limits.

SECRLI

Security Matter ng

UI.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on March 29, 1968, that on that

date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr. discussed

the position which King has found himself in as a result of the

violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1963,

at the time when King led a march

through downtown Memphis.

King

cold Levison that he feels they have to face the fact thatse

from a public relations point of view and every other way,

are in serious trouble"

• He referred to the Washington D.C.

•as tar as it is concerned it is in trouble. King noted that it

will be much more difficult to recruii people for the washington

• campaign now because they (the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference) (SCLC) are recruiting non-violent people and these

people will hold back if they think they will be in a campaign

• that

is going to be taken over by violent elements.

King stated

that

this is not a failure for the SCLC because it has enough

of a program to affirm its position but that it is a personal

setback for himself.

King continued that persons such as Roy Wilkens

' (Head of the National Association for the Advancement of colored

reiterated that they have had a great public relations seback as

far as his image and leadership are concerned.

Martin Luther King, Jr.

Levison attempted to dissuade King from this point

of view stating that it would be true only if king accepts "their"

definitic:

He added that he feit it is a profound error King

is making..

King noted that he did not accept it himself but that

other's will.

Levison retorted that people would accept it for

a: few days,

but, if events prove otherwise, will not accept it.

King noted that events will not prove otherwise unless

they think soberly through this period. He said that somehow he had

to reaffirm what the press will refuse to affirm. He referred to

the Memphis incident stating that they all know it was just a

few people who were involved. He added that it was a failure

of the leadership in Memphis. King Informed Levison that persons

who were responsible for

the violence came to see him on the morning

of March 29, 1968.

He said these persons were fighting the

leadership in Memphis, the men who ignored and

neglected them, the

men who would not give

them any attention, who ordered their

telephones cut off.

King added that he had no knowledge of all this,

that the

persons

responsible for the violence were too sick to see

that what they were doing during the violence was hurting him, king,

more than it could hurt the local preachers.

King related that he was so upset and shocked over. the

• Memphis violence that he was going to announce a personal fast

as a means of appealing to the Memphis leadership, as well as those

who participatea in the violence, to come to him in a united

front to take up the

"cuaget" and

get on with the movement.

• He said he felt this kind of spiritual move would be a way of

unifying the movement, of transforming a minus into a plus. He

added that he feels their Washington campaign is doomed.

Levison attempted to convince Ring that his reasoning

was not correct. Levison said he was concerned over the "trap

King was placing non-violence in because King was saying that

he must have 100% adherence to non-violence which is an impossibility

King commented that they could not get 100% adherence but

that they must face the fact thatariot broke out in the ranks of

the march, that "these fellows"

jump out, do something, and then come back to hide within

the group. King said he is a symbol of non-violence and

that the press is not going to say what Levison said.

He

said the symbol will be weakened and it will put many Negroes

in doubt.

He said he must do someching that is a powerful

act to unify forces and refute the press.

Levison stated that if it had this result he would

agree but that he is bothered by the idea that King would be

accepting the logic of the press. that if King can control 997,

and not the li who are violent, he is a failure. He said they

must find a way in which they do not accept this otherwise King

they not

will never be able to do anything unless he always spiritually

reaches a level where he hypnotizes every Negro alive.

King questioned

how he could say that they can

control the planned demonstrations in Washington, D.C. and at the

same time conclude they are going to have l% violence.

Levison counseled that King can say that he can control

his followers and is not undertaking to control everybody else.

He said King could take the position that his followers are non

violent and will do what they must do.

They agreed to discuss the matter in depthat a meeting

• in Atlanta, Georgia in King's church office on the morning of

March 30, 1963.

The same source advised on March 31, 1900, that or

chat date Stanley Levison commented on the meeting held in Atlanta,

Georgia, on March 30, 1969. Levison's comments included the

following:

At the Atlanta meeting they examined the whole Memphis

Incident and came up with a new approach.

"We are going back to

Memphis.

We are going to prove that you can have mass action

in the streets"

Martin Luther King, Jr:

changed King's thinking.

King is going back to Memphis

on luesday (April 2.

1968) and there will be a big march on

Friday (April 5, 1968).

The Memphis incident was caused ty

"a handful of kids" and it could have been controlled by

"our

guys" (the SCLC) had they been there.

He, Levison, made the point that they could not let

"a couple of kids" keep "mass action" from being their weapon.

As Ior controlling the hashington, D.C. demonstrations,

King knows he can control the youth.

What has to be done is

go to the high schools and tell them what the establishment

wants them to do.

Once they grasp this there is no chance of

anything happening.

What they (the SCLG) are afraid of in

Washington is a double cross from Stokley Carmichael

and the

answer to that is that "our job" (the SCLO'")

but to be non-violent themselves.

"Our position" It thattor iolence

are going to go on because to be able to march inthe streets is

"our' most important tool" and are not going on the streets because

it may start violence. "why do we have to be afraid of riots.

It is their problem not ours"

The Atlanta meeting was good because it shows how

much militancy there is in the ScLc.

A contidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advisec

Mertin Luthet King,

Jr.

Security Matter

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on March 20, 1900, that,

lace on that date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr.

discussed the violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee

on March 28, 1968, following King's leadership

of a protest -

march through downtown Memohis.

King indicated that he has

become so depressed over the developments in Memphis that

he has considered calling off the Washington March (his

self-described Poor People's Campaign, scheduled to begin in

Washington, D.C. on April 22, 1968).

Levison told King that his depression was aggravated

because he is physically exhausted as a result of his recent

strenuous program.: He counseled King not to be on the defensive

over the wents in Memphis. but, on the contrary, should take

majority of people in the Memphis March

did not join in the rioting that took place, proving the

effectiveness of King's leadership and his policy of non-violence.

emphasized that the Washington March will be different

in that King will have organized this march and his forces can

stress the importance of non-violence.

Levison suggested that

Saturday morning (March 30, 1968) would be a better time to

meet in Atlanta to discuss

the Memphis incident rather then

meeting on Friday night (March 29, 1968) because it will give

King time to rest.

King agreed in every respect with Levison's

evaluation.

The source also ascertained that, prior to conferring

with King, Levison spoke with the Reverend

Ralph Abernathy,

an aide of Dr. King's, who advised Levison that King has

cancelled a scheduled

appearance in Washington, D.C. on

March 29, 1968.

Abernathy also noted that King is scheduled

to be in Virginia on Saturday (March 30, 1968) but will

probably cancel that

it was a mistake for the king forces not tohave a staff in

vista hot start

(Marg racing

Abernathy continued that

Memphis to train people in non-violence. He said it also was

a mistake on the part of the King forces not to have been

more aware of the local situation.

reliable information

in the past, advised

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to our memorandum dated March 19,

1968, and captioned as above, which sets forth information

concerning progress in, the organization and planning of the

Washington Spring Project (WSP).

Martin Luther king, Jr., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced

he will conduct a massive cavil disobedience campaign in the

Nation's Capitol during April, 1968, in an' eftort to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

In pursuit. of this project, the SCLC has opened an

' office in Washington, D. C., from which to organize and direct

the ISP.

On March 22, 1968, a press conference was called by

WS? representatives at the SCLC Office, Washington,D. C. (MC).

At the conference an announcement was made that King was expected

•to be in WDC on April 22, 1968, to initiate the WSP by presenting

his requests to Congress. They further announced that late in

April or early May: 1968, they expect three thousand demonstrators

to arrive. The emphasis

is being placed on the length of the

demonstration rather than the number of demonstratois and they

do not expect the number of demonstrators to exceed five

thousand and will possibly limit the number to that figure. They

expect the demonstrators to remain in WDC as long as necessary or

until they get tired and return to their homes.

militants to stay out of the activities, there is no

assurance the request will be honored.

RE:. WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

A source, who has furnished reliable information in

the past, advised

on March 5, 1968, that James Gibson, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Representative from

National Headquarters of, SCLE, Atlanta, Georgia, is presently

attempting to recruit participants for the Washington Spring

Project (WSP) in the Virginia Counties of Amelia, Brunswick

Lunenberg.

A characterization of SCIC is attached hereto.

It is stated this recruiting drive, aimed at

attracting persons in the hard-core unemployed and

low income

employed groups, has not been too successful. Persons approached

have been asked to attend and participate in captioned sctivities

at Washington, DoC. A lack of funds needed to obtain the required

transportation is a major problem.

s Who ras furnished reliable information

in the past, has advised that the participation of people from

Mississippi and, Alabama in list In the Richmond - Petersburgs

Virginia, area, is siill in a very nebulous plaming stage.

It appears that leon sall, Crensta, Mississippi, 1s

actively engaged in the foimulation of such plans.

tentative plans call for a march by these persons with persons

from Petersburg, Virginia, fron Fetersburg to Richmond

Virginia.

This march is to be conducted on or about April 22, 1968, the

announced date that a SCio sponsored march from Baltimore:

Maryland, to Washington, D.Co, will take place as a kick-ort

RE: WASHINGION SPRING PROJECT

On March 4, 1968, Reverend Everett D. Smith; Richmona,.

Virginia, & member of the State Board of Virginia of SCIC,

advised he has been in close contact with Dr. Martin Luther King

regarding plans for the latter's visit to Virginia on March 30,

1968.

These plans, which are subject to change, are that Di. King

will visit Danville, Virginia, and Prince Edward County, Virginia,

on the latter date.

He will appear at a rally held at a Negro

church

in Richmona, Virginia, later, In the day of March 30, 1960.

According to Reverend Smiun,

the purpose of Dr. King's visit to

Virginia is to stimulate interest and participation in the WSP

as well as to promote the interest and growth of SCho.

Reverend Smith and other sources, who are in a position

to learn of activities in connection with WSP. have advised

generally that they do not anticipate that promotion of WSP will

be too successiul in the Richmond area. They based their

opinions on past experiences in this type of activity.

They

advised these have not been too successful in the past, describing

race relations in the Richmond area as good.

They pointed out that there exists in Richmond a "rilddler

class complacency" that has prevented a concerted or mass united

effort in the promotion of activities designed to better the

conditions of Negroes in the community.

This "complacency"

teel, is based on the fact there are dogs for Nesses, and chiney

group is compared to other areas, economically well off.

They pointed

that Negroes heve

been and are being hired in

City jobs and in othei positions formerly available only to

persons of the white race.

"Getting 3,000 poor, unemployed folks to pick up

more than enthusiasm and

dedication.

now is he going to feed them every day? Where is he going

to house them every night?

problems? Their legal problems? The problems of discipline

Where is the money for all of these things going to come from?

"If I understand Dr. King's program, he

says he

is going to keep his followers in Washington indefinitely.

Let's iake a short period of 14 days.

Feeding each person

will cost at least 91.00 a day. This then, is $3,000.

In April weather even in Washington, these people will have

to nave some kind of shelter over their heads

at night. If

for $1.00 per person per night, he will

This is another $3,000 per day.

To provide

other necessities that people

require each day, will cost

a mininum of 50g per person a

day. This adds another $1,500.

So, at the lowesi possible estimate,

each person will cost

$2.50 per day.

For 3,000 people, this adds up to $105,000

for just 14 days.

"Then, there are the expenses of Dr. King's staff and

other functionaries.

The traveling expense of these people

going and coming.

the whole thing will add up to a staggering

amount of somebody's money.

"How deas Dr. King propose to raise this money?

Moving on faith is one thing, but, 3,000 people, no matter

how snuch faith they have, need food and shelter. Somebody

will have to produce this in fact, not theory.

"Since most, if not all of the people Dr. King is trying

to recruit are poor and unemployed, wouldn't it be better to

try to get these people into training programs in their local

communities?

franting that some southern communities may not

have auch federally. financed programs, isn't it better to

petition the government to provide them rather than

taking these paople off on a wild goose chase to Washington

where, no matter what happens, they will have to go back to

their home conmunities for whatever benefits they are to

"Since lobbying for meaningful civil rights legis-

he really using these unfortunate people who can least

afford the time or money, as human dawns. Inspiring them

with promises as an inducement to get their participation,

is creating a false hope of personal reward before they

return home.

If they return home disillusioned and empty

nanded, they become prime examples of futility in their

communities.

"This must not be permitted to happen.

The best

way to prevent it, is not to take them to Washington

in the first place.

If a demonstration of power or foice

or whatever you want to call it, is deemed necessary in

Washington, then let those who can afford it march on

Congress and the President.

Past efforts have proven that

sizeeble numbers can be induced

to ira out for a just cause.

"I an afraid Dr. King's venture is frought vith

The Negro has a just cause.

There is urgent need for putting pressure at every point

in our civil rights fight to achieve meaningful results.

This pressure should be pushed at the local, state and

retional levels.

Every resource at the Negro's command should

• be pressed into the fight.

"On this, Dr. King or no one else will find any

opposition.

However, doing something just for the publicity

of it and, using unfortunate human beings, is just going too

far.

"It would be most unfortunate if what happened to

the bonus merchers in the late twenties during the Hoover

administration, happened to Di. King's marchers. Unfortunately,

the present feeling of a large segment of white people is to

use the police force and, even the National Guard and the U.S.

Army to suncess any riots. You can see from the way the

National Guard acted recently in Orangeburg, S.C., what to

expect in any future riots. Every law enforcement agency

explaining that the Covernment would establish prog-ams

to employ those unable to get jobs elsewhere.

"'Present training and employment programs are

woefully inadequate.

And we doubt that business will pro-

vide the jobs needed despite the government subsidy to be

offered,' he said.

"Also to be urged is that congress discard the new

Social Security amendment which would limit the num-

ber of children on the Aid to Dependent Children program

for whom federal funds would be provided after July 1."

workly to organize the wSt group in the Cleveland area, however,

they also have sone other unknown individuals who are assisting

in the recruiting activities.

For the most part, OSBURN and SIBLER heve been working

two other projects which

seem to take most of their time;

namely, Operation Breadbasket, which is a program aimed at

increasing Negro employment through a boycott of varlous stores

and employers; the second is the strike at st. Luke's Hospital,

Cleveland, Ohio, by the building, Service, and Maintenance Union.

This strike was recently settled, which will now sive Reverend

OSTUKN and BIBLER more time to work on the WSP.

The WSP in Cleveland has an office at 7902 Hough

Avere, which is not being used as all the work is being done

fron kererend osaurk's apartment at the bark Lane Villa hotel:

The WSP has been recruiting people in Cleveland

through the bruce hunder rreedom flouse, the Domestic Workers

unzon, and Mothors on welfare. Reverend OSBURN plans to recruit

two hundred people from the poor areas, those on welfare, etc.,

and OSBURN feels he will not have too much trouble in getting

this many people as he has recruited larger numbers in the past

for other projects.

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Levison told Jones that he had received an excellent

response to a recent mailing. The solicitations were running

ahead of last year with $15,000 being received in one day.

Levison informed that the letter soliciting funds was carefully

written explaining King's project and, because of the success,

he was sending it to 250,000 more people.

Levison also told Jones that things are going well

in the mobilization for the project and King informed him that

people from Alabama and Mississippi are "just raring to go."

OBSERVATIONS:

On February 28, 1968, a WFO informant informed us

that Bernard Lafáyette, project Director for SCLC, had informed

him King's organization is experiencing difficulty with re-

cruiting demonstrators for the "Washington Spring Project."

Because of this; the demonstrations would not start the first

week of April as originally planned.

Another-WFO informant learned from Lafayette's

assistant. Anthony Henry that a secret meeting had been held

by King's group and they

had set April:27, 1968, as the date

for the project to start. Henry indicated this

date can be

moved up or back depending on future developments.

It is felt that the President would be interested in

receiving information showing the communist help King is re-

ceiving in his proposed "Washington Spring Project."

RECOMMENDATION:

That copies of the enclosures be forwärded to

Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House; Mr. William Welsh,

Administrative Assistant to the Vice President; Secretary of

Agriculture Freeman; Secretary of Labor Wirtz; Secretary of

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

has tried, without success, to dissuade King from executing

the Project. Dr. Morsell is afraid that King cannot control

: the demonstrators and there is alikelihood that the overall

demonstration will be taken over by extremists.

King appears to be concentrating his attention on

the South where he has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft

to help speid him about urging people to support his campaign.

SCLE advised recently that the entire Washington

Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision, petty

bickering among the staff members and the idiosyncrasies of

(King's ego. This source advised that King is worried about

the lack of progress being made by his recruiters. He is

conceried about the success of the program. He has instructed

his staff to seriously consider whether or not they can

successfully carry out the Project. If. they cannot then it

will be necessary to establish a reason as to why he finds

it necessary to discontinue the Washington Spring Project.

RECOMMENDATION:

Thai copies of the enclosures be forwarded to

Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House; Mr. William Welsh,

Adminiatrative Assistant to the Vice President; Secretary of

Agriculture Freeman;

Sacretary of Labor Wirtz; Secretary of

Defense; Secret Service; the Attorney General; the Deputy

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

This past

week King concentrated his attention on

the Sout' and spoke at rather larger gatherings in Birmingham,

Montgomery, and Selma, Alabama.

King has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft to

help speed him about the South urging people to support his

Washington Spring Project:

Another source advised

recently that the entire

•Washington Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision,

petty bickering among the staff members, and the idiosyncrasies

of King's ego. This source advised that King is worried about

the lack of progress being made by his recruiters.

He is con-

cerned about the success of the program. He has instructed his

staff to seriously consider whether or not they can successfully

carry out the Project. If they cannot, then it will be necessary

: to establish a reason as to why he finds is necessary to dis-

continue the Washington Spring Project.

In this connection, the "Miami Herald" newspaper on

February 18, 1968; reported that some Negro leaders will urge

• King to detour his planned massive civil disobedience demon-

stration scheduled for April, 1968, in Washington, D. C.; and

•redirect the demonstrators to the local districts of Congressmen

.:who have voted against civil rights legislation. These leaders

feel that Congressmen do not care what happens in

Washington, D. C., but they would feel the impact of these

demonstrations in their home districts.

anticipate from other organizations and thousands of

indiviäuals.

"America is at a crosscoads of history, and it

is critically important for us, a nation and a society,

to chooses new path and nove upon it with resolution

and courage.

"It is impossible to under-estimate the crisis we face

in America.

The stability of a civilization, the potential

a1 free government, and the simple boudr of men axe at

stake.

•

"Those who serve in the humi-fights movement,

including our Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

are keenly arare of the increasing bitterness and

despair and frustration that threaten the worst chico,

hatred and violence any nation has ever encountered.

"In a sense, we are alresdy at war with and ancug

ourselves.

Affluert Americans are locked into suburbs

of physical comort and neutal insecurity; poor Anericans

are locked irside ghettoes of material privation and

spiritusl debilitation; and all of us can almost feel

the presence of a kind

of social insanity which could

lead to national ruin.

Purrs starving to lass samp while prosperous

Negro mothers laaving children in terements to work

in neighborhoods "where people of color can not live.

Or the aresons comparcmere, already greater tran

very nearly disarm a timid action agairsi poverty.

Or a nation gorged on noney while nillions of its

citizers ara denied a good education, adequate health

services,

decent housing, meaninglul

employment,

and even

respect, and are then told to be responsible.

rhe true responsibility for the existence of

these deplorable conditions lies ultinately with the

larger society, and much of the immediate respon-

sibility for removing the injustices can be laid

directly at the door of the federal government.

siThis is the institution wich has

the power to

act, the resources to tag, and the duty to respond.

that we

must proceed at once io tear down and rebuild

joining in such groups as the new Urban Coslition io

urge progressive economic reasures at the national

level. Many

urban politioal leaders are ready to

carry out enlightened programs 11 only the federai

government will provide the needed financial support.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

The "Hiari Herald," a local Riani,

reported February 18, 1958, that soue Negro

leaders, not further

identified, will urge DI. MARTIN ITHER KING,

Jo, at neetings

In Miami, Florida, to detour his plarned rassive

civil

dis-

obedience demonstration scheduled for April in Washington, D.C.

The Negro leaders will recommend that efforts be redirected

to demonstrate in districts of Congressnen who have voted

against civil rights

legislation.

The "Miani Herald" reported that one prominent civil

rights leader, who requested

his identity be withheld,

said

"Congressmen could care 'less about demonstrations in

Fashington--

and Nagroes could be made to 100k bad

I nationally. But it the

denonstrations are held in the home districts of

certain

Congressner they most certainiy will teel the impact."

Mk T-l advised on February 19, 1968, chat Dr. MARTIN

NUThER LING, UR., arrIVed at thE

Sheraton Four. Ambassadors

Hotel &t 10:30 PM

on February 18, 1938.

DI. KING refused to

villize the suite reserved for hin and kept noving fron room

tO tOON.

Two Oi DI. KING's aides, identisied as Di. A. YOUNG

End Reverend F. C. BENNETT, made a

thorough check of the

room reserved for

Dr. KNG, apparently looking for a "bugging

device."

DI, KING, through Dr. YONG and Reverend BENNETT,

according to the source, has

already refuser to be intervieved

•Dy the various news nedia and it appeared to the source that

KING was quite concerned with the

amount of security being

eftected by the sheraton Four Ambassadors Hotel, along with

local authorities.

On February I2, 1968, a meeting of members of the

a serious thicat against the life of Martin Luther King and

that an attempt upon his life will be made during this march.

In order to counteraci such an attempt, Reverend Bennette

was assigned to be in charge of security for Martin Luther

King and Ralph Henry was assigned to be Reverend Bennette's

assistant. It was indicated thai those involved in this

security should be alert for dangor, not only from white

persons but also from Negroes.

No additional information

was given at this time concerning any possible threats.

It was reported by several of those present thai

serious difficulty had been encountered in the northern states

in recruiting participants for the lashington Spring Project.

li was, therefore, decided to concentrate the recruitment of

participants in the southern states.

It was also reported that serious financial problems

have developed, especially in certain areas. Hosea Williams

presented proposed budgets for the "financially deprived or

unresponsive areas involved in the Washington campaign." He

stated that for one roason or another the following areas

seemed to be having unsolved financial problems in getting

their mobilization and recruiting started:

Mississippi

Alabama

Georgia

North Carolina

South Carolina

Virginia

Washington, D. C.

Baltimore, Maryland

Williams stated that it was originally planned that

each project area was to raise its own funds,

however, this

•.does

not seem possible in the poorer areas at this time.

He

reported that he had conferred with project leaders in the

above areas and they state that they can do the job provided

they are furnished the resources to get it started. Based on

Williams' conversations with these leaders, a budget has been

drawn up for each of the above areas which

provides between

$1,200 to $1, 500 per month with the exception of south Carolina

which will receive $740 and Washington, D. C., which

will

receive $3, 500. Those budgets include paynents for items such

On 1/29/68 at an SCLC Executive Staff meeting

KING announced HOSEA WILLIANS would serve as "Field

Director" in Washington, D: C"., of the WSP and also kave'

overall supervision of SCLC personnel involved in this

project. (re Atlanta, airtel and LiM 2/2/68). ANDREW 5.

Executive Vice President, SCLC, at that time vas

instructed by KING to write a letter to, each SCIC stati

member previously assigned to various cities and locations

¿o recruit demonstrators for the WSP in which he was to

inforn them of WILLIAMS' position.

On 2/12/68 WILLIAMS determined this letter had

cor been written and as a result SCLC personnel. did not

keer to whon they should report or from whom to

seeks

assistance.

WILLIAMS also submitted during the 2/12/68 meeting

a memorandum in which he requested a budget (of approzimiely $10,000 )

a sacrsters,and an Assistant in order to effectively supervise

"SP.

Inere then ensured at this meeting considerable

jassy discussion as to the validity of WILLIAMS' requests.

WINDIAN A. RUTHERFORD, Executive Director, SCLe,

dorio over the fact he did not have the time or'inorintion

to pass jungment on a multitude of vouchers which WiLLians

would subnit in connection with his budget. WILLIANS became

enzaged and left the meeting for almost an hour. KINd mude

will be successêzi

without the benefit of WILLIANS' full energies or take a chance

tke.WSP may not succeed and have the national and international

It is

because of the latter informant

believes that KING has indicated

Based upon information herein and previous information

submitted it is felt informant's observations are ressoner

accurate.

Almost haif the period of time originally planed

by SCIC to recruit and train its WSP demonstrators has passed act

the entire project seems to be suffering from indecision and fetty

„PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER

A cunfidential source on Tebruary 14, 1968, advised

he had learned that Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.,

President,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), continued to

be discouraged with the lack of progress made by SCLe staff

members in recruiting and training demonstrators for SCiC's

Washington Spring Project, (WSP). In this connection Reverend

King recently held an

officers to consider the WSP.

"emergency meeting" of the SOLd Exacutive

Reverend ling pointed out that SCLC has presiously

announced that it will have s,000 demonstrators in Wastington,

Do Co. in early April 1968. Should only a few hundred demonstrators

appear in Washington, D. C., Reverend King said he and SCIC would

become the laughing stock of the nation.

'He declared that if

SCue produces 3,000 demonstrators and the nation fails to react

approprIateLy thIS Will be the reSponsIbility oI Goe nadon

and nor sould on the ocher bana, he said, schc will be greatly

at fault if it does not produce the

announced number of

demonstrators.

Reverend tang suggested that officers of SCiC seriously

cossider whether or not

they can succeserully.carry

• out the

planned WSP. He said if they feel they cannot then it will

be

necessary to establish a reason as to why he and SCIC finds

It necessary to discontinue the ISP.

to 11:00 p.M., January 21, 1968:

However,

the workshop did not begin arriving for the workshop until

late in the afternoon of January 20, 1568. There wire appromis

nately twenty-six individuals present when the workshop finally

non-violent demonstration techniques.

The discussions

centered around the lashington Spring Projeci, being sponsored

•by the SCLO at Washington, D.C., during the summer of 1968.

During thoir comments to the group, Reverend Oaburn,

Bibies, and Bristol indicated they had attended a meeting of

the SCiC recently in Atiania, Goorglas

Reverend Osburn indicated the demonstration in

Washington, D. C., would be composed initially of about 3,000

people from poverty areas in the United States, including

whites,

Negroes, and Puerto Ricans.

Washington, D. C., and during the first week or ten days would

demonstrate on the issues of poverty and jobs. After that

period, the

demonstration would pick up the peace issues.

In connection with that situation, Reverend

Bristol pointed out that the technique of blocking

in washington, D. C., could tie up traffic. That could be

accomplished without

laws which require a person to abey a stop light, there are no

Rutherford related that the day following the

church meeting they (scLe officials, held a private

meeting

"with these guys" and "lit into them'

Rutherford

stated that he told Stokely (Carmichael) that he, Rutherford,

wanted to hear what Stokely had to say, and that

Stokely

gave some "mealy-mouthed excuses" that did not stand up.

Rutherford also noted that he told Carmichael that "these

men told us" that they are interested in the total

destruction of the United States.

Levison commented that he had heard Stokely say

this and rutherford's comment was that "this is what

Rap (Brown) said last night"

• Rutherford continued

that stokely is now

"sweet as pie.

He pulled a power play

on us in washington".

, but aid not win anything because

everybody was opposing him.

Levison commented that he could not see the SCLC

lecting ten persons who threaten violence take over from

hundreds.

He described it as a dangerous thing, a king of

black facisin.

Rutherford, in referring to the meeting, related

that a person named

Courtland (phonetic), whom he

described

as having been with the Congress of Racial Equality, made

the statement that "they" would not support "our campaign"

"from them" was that they would not attempt to divide

the community.

He said

"they" were honest, that "they"

stated that if the SCLC. fails in Washington, "we're going

to get a'lot of new recruits!"

but if the SOLC is successful

"we are going to be in trouble"

• He recalled that at

Chis moment King made a point, that if "they" should

denounce the government, denounce the SCLC campaign and

criticize it, this would create an atmosphere within wnich

non-violence would have a better chance of succeeding.

He added that Stokely responded that they have enough

problems, that there is enough confusion and division

In the black community, and that; If they should speak

out against kins or what he is doing, people will not

know which way to turn.

Levison commented that he agreed with Carmichael

and disagreed with King on this point. He inquired as to

why King was upset..

Rutherford stated that king said the enemy was

violence and began to preach on how violence begets

violence.

Levison

related that the key is that King states

the enemy is violence which is not true. The enemy are

the forces preventing them from getting rights and violence

is one of the methods. He said that, therefore, they are

trying to develop a

counter technique to violence.

"The worker"

, an East Coast Communist newspaper,

in Its issue dated February 11, 1968, page one, contains

an article on the protest against United Suaves involvement

In the war in Vietnam in Washington, D.C. on February

5,6, 1968, sponsored by the Clergy and Laymen Concerned

About Vietnam.

It states that King addressed the gathering

of clergymen

and laymen and told them that "it was imperative

that the freedom and peace movements be joined. Describing

the worsening economic conditions, he appealed to the

religious leaders to join and support the demonstrations his

organization has planned for washington in April"

article also notes that king made It clear that the targets

of the demonstrations would be the Vietnam war and Congress.

can be trusied to not interfere with SCIC's efforts

concerning the

WSP.

Reverend King commented to several SCIC officials

that in anticipation of SNCC creating problems (not explained)

for SCLC in'implementing the WSP it might be very practical

for SCLC to organize "local groups" in Washington, D. C., and

other communities concerned with the WSP.

The function of

these groups, he said, would be to oppose any undesirable activity

on the part or SNCC rather than require SCLC personnel to divert

their energies from the NSP.

BH T-1 said Rev, Shuttles

worth has stated he does not look with favor on any coalition

between hippies, radical pacifists, drait, cara burners. black

cannot conceive of anything short of violence taking place

when these type factions get into a demonstration.

BH T-1 said Shuttlesworth recently stated, "It would

be impossible not to get the wrong people in such a march and

once violence got started you couldn't control it." According

to BH I-I, Shuttlesworth intends to raise questions about the

wisdom of

King's widely publicized Washington demonstrations

for April.

BH T-1 said Shuttlesworth feels that Rev.

king vill

try to find an honorable way to back down from the planned

demonstrations. Rev. Shuttlesworth said the country is in no

condition to stand "that type of thing" but he is opposed

the Vietnam war and

that King was in Chicago at this time generally to provide

impetus to the local organizing efforts in behalf of the

WSP, a program whereby the SCLC plans to mobilize large

numbers of persons in Washington, D.C. during April, 1968,

to protest United States Government failures to solve the

# In this connection King reportedly planned to met with

GeorgoWiley, believed to be from New York City, and who is

head of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) •

NWRO is currently holding a three day convention in Chicago.

According to this source, Wiley was at a recent

neeting In New York City, New York

where support for the

ISP was solicited by SCLC personnel; however, Wiley would not

agree to participate in this SCLC project.

King's contact

with Wiley in Chicago, therefore, will represent an effort to

persuade him of the importance of lending his support to the

WSP.

This source, as well'as the first source, advised

King has no known public appearances scheduled while in

Chicago other than a

press conference to be held sometime

during the late afternoon or evening of this date.

King is

also not known to have any meetings scheduled with the local

SCLC staif; however, it was expected that in all probability

he would meet individually with some key local personnel

in connection with the WSP.

No information was available to either of the

above sources concerning King's departure plans from Chicago,

although it was anticipated he would depart Chicago during

the late evening hours of February 5, 1968, or early on

February 6, 1968.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

intormation in the gast, learned on January 31, 1900, that or

that date, Stanley, Levison was in contact with williar

/Rutherford, Executive Director of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC). Levison noted that he met

red hike at harry, ach that lase Soned bast rustin,

colors" by opposing civil disobedience.

He said Rustin is

also opposed to involving the war issue.

Levison, in referring to the civil disobedience

campaign, planned by king, for washington D.C.

(WDC), in the

Spring of 1968, felt that tactics must be agreed upon in the

near future so that persons who have been making inquiry can

be told what tactics will be used.

Rutherford told Levison that Andy Young (Executive

Vice-President of the SCLC), had written out some of the

tactics to be used.

He said that, for example, during the

first week, calls will be made on

Congressman by people from

17 different areas, During the second week, calls will be

made on heads of departments such as the Secretary of Labor.

On the first visit, demands will be made and on the second,

a sit-in will be conducted.

With respect to a proposed civil rights newspaper,

Levison feels it should follow the formula of "The Southern

Courier", which, he said, can humanize the news without

vulgarizing it.

He emphasized that, although SCLC policy

must be the policy followed by the newspaper, efforts must

be made to avoid a dull, uninteresting style.

• Rutherford noted that King has an SCLC Board meeting.

on luesday, and Wednesday, (February 6 and 7, 1968), a

clergy march on Monday, and a private meeting with (Stokely

varmichael and with other Black Leaders in wDo, and ther

wile go to rniladelphia and do the same thing"

• Rutherford

added "meet once with the ministers and once with the Black

Power people to try to neutralize them".

The source advised that he gathered the impression

that the above described activity by king will be in connection

with organizing for the spring civil disobedience campaign

in WDC.

Levison and Rutherford also discussed financial

contributors to the SCLC. Levison said he had suggested to

King that they get about 25 contributors together and

I meet

with them for several days and let them ask King as many

questions as they careto. Levison stated that he would check

the list of contributors and check with Rutherford as to

where they should hold this meeting since it should depend

on the residence of most of the contributors.

A confidential source, ino has furnished

maste who requested that his identity not

be disclosed outside the Bureau.

He was assigned two symbol

numbers and two dates to further conceal him because there has

been no publicity in the press re the presence of ORANGE

and TABB in Philadelphia.

He also advised that he had

learned from a very highly placed delicate source that

ORANGE had said that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING of SCLC is

intending to come to Philadelphia in late March or early

-April 1968 and that Dr. KING will make a concerted effort

in Philadelphia itself to:

(1) Get Police Commissioner FRANK L. RIZZO ousted;

(2) Obtain real open housing for Negroes in Phila-

delphia;

(3) Obtain employment for the unemployable Negro

in the ghetto;

(4) Renovation of the school system in Philadelphia

so. that it better meets the needs of the Negro in Philadelphia.

CONF SOURCE

It should be noted that this information was received

1/26/68, prior to Philadelphia receipt

of the information in Atlanta

teletype to Bureau 1/18/68

(Xerox co to Philadelphia) which included the Dr. KING

schedule of visits to "target" cities.

•CONE, SOUREE

also advised that his source had said

that Dr. KING had some intention of coming to Philadelphia

in early January during the hearing in U. S. District Court,

EDPa.,

seeking the removal of Commissioner RIZZO because of

his alleged mishandling of a Black Student Rally: KING decided

not to come to Philadelphia because the Judges hearing the

case were bending over backwards to give the plaintiffs a

fair hearing.

RE:

WASHINGTON SPRINO PROJECT

On January 26, 1968, Confidential Informant T-1

advised that the weekly

• meeting of the Alabama Christian

Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) was held on January 22,

1968, at St. Luke's AME Zion Church, 3937 12th Avenue North,

in attendance:

Confidential Informant I-1 stated that Albert

Turner made a plea for 300 Alabamians to prepare to go to

Washington to take part in the Washington. Spring Project

this April. Turner said that Negroes must join in with

: *Dr. King because the SCLC is at a very low ebb and in danger

of a takeover by Black Power advocates. Turner made known

that he came to Birmingham irom Detroit where violent

claim that last summer's burnings were small compared to what

they plan to do this summer.

Turner said th t if these forces

try to destroy Detroit, that the entire Civil Rights movement

will be lost and the leaders killed or put in jail. Turner

told the group that Rev. M. I. King, jI's. program

of civil

• disobedience does not call for lying down'in the streets but.

merely "sitting in." However, Turner stated that participants

should be ready to be jailed.

• WASHINGTON SPRING

PROJECT (WSP)

All sources used in this communication have

furnished reliable information in the past.

CV I-1 advised on December 3, 1967 that he

recently learned that during the reek commencing

November 27, 1907 the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) held a retreat at Penn Center, Frognore,

South Carolina, which was presided over by Rev.

LUTHER KING, JR., President of SCLC and

by approximately 70 incividuals comprising the headquarters

and field stafi' of SCLC.

The primary purpose of the retreat was to discuss

_various facets of SCIO's plan to conduct massive non-

vinlent demonstrations in Washington, D. C. and possibly

a number of other cities during the early part of 1968.

Reverend KING outlined this plan to those attending

the retreat; namely, that it had

been tentatively decided

that in the forecart of February, 1968; he, together with

other officers of SCIC and in all probability leading

representatives of other Civil Rights organizations

(not

identified) would personally present. to the Secretary of

Labor specific requests for prompt Congressional action

pertaining to employment, income, housing, education,

and

other metters which constitute major problems experienced

by ghetto people. In the event these

requests do not

receive an irmediate unequivocal commitment insuring

→...

prompt Congressional action, an immediate massive non-

violent demonstration would commence in Washington, D. C.

This demonstration would be conducted by schC and involve

adults from all walks of life,

including students-and

school children.

If an effort is' made by civil and/or

military authorities to quell this demonstration, simultaneous

demonstrationa of identical magnitude would commence in

10-15 "target cities" thmugnout the nation.

RE:

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP).

CV. T-I was not aware of the identity of all the

"target 'cities" referred to by Rev. KING but he understood

Cleveland was one of the cities included.

CV T-1 went on that according to Rev. KING that

during the period prior to early February, 1968, one or

two SCIC staff members

would be assigned to Washington,

D. C. and. each of the "target cities."

It will be the

responsibility of these members to select in each community

up

• to 200 individuals who will serve as leaders for

demonstrations.

This type of individual sought will be

unemployed Negro males, whose general economic status is so

low that they could lose nothing by participating in the

proposed

demonstrations. After selection of these individuals

it would then be the responsibility of the SCLC staff member

through mass meetings, workshops or other procedures to

indoctrinate these individuals with SCLC's overall

objectives and technique, of non-violent demonstration.

• Rev.-KING emphasized that the individuals so selected

a should be Negroes, however, he said once each demonstration

is actually commenced the assistance of white perzons

would definitely be accepted and possibly solicited.

Reverend KING acknowledged this progran of

demonstrations was a very substantial undertaking for SCLE

to embark upon.

He said it was imperative that SCLC be

successful in

1 this undertaking because otherwise not only

would it be embarrassed by a failure but failure

itself

would in a large sense serve as a victory for the

"Black

Power"

groups.

In this connection, he said it would be

necessary to solicit the cooperation of "Black Power"

Leaders (not identified) in order thet such organisations

would permit SCLC to conduct 1ts program without inter-

demonstration into a riot. He declared that if such

situation developed in any one of the communities in which

SCIC contemplates demonstrating SCLC will immediately

cease all its activity in that community.

During the retreat an appreciable number of

SCLC staff members expressed doubt that the cooperation

of the "Black Power" organizations could be obtained and

raised a question as to whether the selection of up to

200 individuals in various communities might not present

a most difficult task. Reverend KING responded by stating

he was most confident he could obtain the desired cooperation

He said he realized these people

did not agree with his methods or the activities of SCLC

but is confident they have sufficient respect for him to

listen to his reguests: He also said he was quite confident

that people, after being apprised of SCLo's objectives,

will be anxious to assist.

Furthermore, he expressed

optimism

that once the demonstrations commence there will be sullicient

sympathy on the part of the general public

that SCLe will

will receive adequate financial support.

CV I-l subsequently learned that Rev. KING had

informed SCLC. staff members that this new activity would

be called Washington Spring Project.

CV T-1 also advised on December 19: 196? that

he recently learned that various assignments

had been

made of SCIC members to various, cities in the United

States in connection with the forthcoming WSP and the tws

being assigned to the Cleveland area were EDDIE OSBURN and

OV I-2 mentioned in January, 1968 that he learned

Atlanta, Georgis,

for the purpose

of discussing and planning

strategy regarding SCLO'S WSP which

jit contemplated

initiating in early April, 1968.

In attendance were

approximately 35 individuals, who were SCIC staff members.

At one of the sessions it was mentioned that in all

probability Congress would not accept or act on the

demands presented by SCIC. If this happens, it was then

planned

to begin protesting this refusal by means of

aisrupting various agencies and facilities throughout

Washingten, D. C. for example one group was tentatively

scheduled to tie up

the Washington Greyhound Bus Station

utiliring such tactics as lying down in front si buses,

blocking entrances and exits, etc. It was expected that

numerous arrests would be made of the participants of this

srojret and it was pointed out thet the participents must

be

"totally committed" to the project and be willing to

rick

arrest.

It is even possible that some persons may

be killed and the participants must be prepared to spend

up to six months in jail; however,

Information regarding the SCLC conference held at Atlanta,

Georgia from January 15-17, 1968; source added that during

the conference, Rev. KING said

there was no doubt that

the requests that would be presented to the various

government agencies would receive a non-committal type

response. Then 200 demonstrators previously recruited by

SCLC in approximately 15 communities will then commence

a massive non-violent demonstration in Washington, D. C.

In conjunction with the activity of the

approximately 3000 demonstrators in Washington, D. C.,

SCIC contemplates that in each community from which these

demonstrators come there will be sympathetic simultaneous

demonstrations.

These demonstrations will be participated

in by individuals who do not go to Washington, D. C. but

experience the same problems and seek the same solutins

as the demonstrators in Washington.

SCLC intends that the

demonstrators will not be intimidated in their efforts

by injunctions or other legal measures designed to serve

es deterrents.

The demonstrators will submit to arrest and

incarceration without bail, however,

the place of an incar-

cerated demonstrator will be assumed by another demonstrator.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER

-

On January I7, 1968, a confidential source,

advised he had learned that the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date concluded

a retreat which was held January 15, 1958 -

January 17, 1958, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church,

Atlanta,

Georgia,

of which Church Reverend Martin

Luther King, Jx., President, SCLC, serves as co-pastor.

This retreat was concerned

with SCLC's Washington

Spring Project (VSP, Thich it contemplates initiating

carly in April 1963. In ationdance were approximately

50 individuals, about one-half of

whom

were SCIC field

representatives fron various

locations.

Reverend King pointed out he did not have

any desire that SCLO should have any friction with

"Black Power groups" during the course of its WSP.

He said the basic issue oi the ISP was jobs or income

and the validity of this issue could not be argued by

"Black Power groups" or anyone else.

He said SCLC

would simply go about its business

of implementing

the WSP.

Reverend King declared that in the event.

SCLC is not successiul awakening the

conscience di tha

nation to the urgent nedd for jobs or income through

the WSP the nation will subsequently liave to adnit hat

SCIC made a substantial effort in this regard. In the

event of such failure, Reverend King said there could

be no question that the "Black Power groups" mould benefit

appreciably..

WASHINGION SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL HATTER

On January 17, 1968, a confidential source

advised he had learned that the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date culminated

a three-day retreat held in Atlanta, Georgia.

This

retreat was held in facilities of the Ebenezer

Baptist Church of which Reverend Hartin Luther King,

Jr., Presideni, SCLC, serves as co-pastor and also

attended by approximately 50 individuals. Approzimately

one half of the individuals in attendance were SCLC

field representatives from various locations.

representative (identity not known) of the Anerican

Friends Service Committee attended this retreat.

Reverend King served as the presiding officer

at the retreat, the essential purpose of which was twofold.

First, to afford SCLC staff menbers opportunity to fully

understand the objective of the SCLC Washington Spring

Project, discuss anticipated problems and seek solutions

thereto. Secondly, to permit Feverend King to infuse

SCLC staff members with enthusiasm to participate in the

project in order that it will be a success.

An appreciable amount of time at the retreat was

devoted to group discussions by the SCLC field representatives

who will'recruit demonstrators to participate

in the Washington Spring Project. James Bevel,

former Director of Direct Action, SCLC, and

Hosea. Villians, Director of Voter Registration

and Political Education, SCLC, actively participated

in these discussions.

Both Bevel and Williams have

had considerable experience in the area of Civil.

Rights demonstrations.

Reverend King lectured several times

during this retreat concerning the overall purpose

Of SCLC's Washington Spring Project. He pointed

out this project would be predicated on the issue

of jobs or income for Ghetto Negroes and impoverished

people of all races in the United States.

However:

he emphasized this would not solve all the problems

experienced by the Negro, particularly those

regarding Inequality and therefore the Civil Rights

Movement as a whole will have many things to achieve

as years go by.

Acquiring jobs or income for Negroes alone,

DI. King declared, will be

¿ noteworthy achievement

on the part of the Washington Spring Project, however,

he stressed that the jobs or the

income obtained would

represent a mere fraction of that which America owes

the Negro throughout history.

He said America owes an

incalcuable sum to the Negro who throughout his long

years of involuntary servitude labored to build this

country.

Di. King stated that the many problems of the

Negro and other poor people will not be solved under

a Capitalistic system. Capitalism,he said, has no remedy

for the poor.

The ultimate aim of all aggrieved people

in the United States can only be to accomplish a change

in the existing Capitalistic economy and Government.

He suggested this change might be to "some form of

Socialistic Government". Reverend King did not discuss

in any

detail how or when the change he referred to

might be accomplished.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On January 17, 1968, during his closing

comments at this retreat Reverend King emphasized

to the SCLC staff that the forthcoming Washington

Spring Project will be one of the most difficult

tasks which it to date has undertaken and

accordingly challenged the staff to maintain itself

both willing and able in order that the project will

be successful.

Reverend King referred to how Jesus found

it necessary to send Eis disciples on various missions.

He told the members of the SCic staif that they were

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

The following information has been supplied

by a confidential source of this Bureau who has furnished

reliable information in the past.

Martin Luther Kings JI., President of the

Southern Christian Leadership Conferences held a conference

with approximately 50 people in Atlanta, Georgia, from

January 15 through 17, 1968, to discuss plans for the

massive civil disobedience in Washington, D. C., which he

calls the "Washington Spring Project." This project will

commence in late March, 1968. King's representatives

will attempt to recruit 3,000 Negro people from the ghetto

areas in 15 "target cities" throughout the United States

to go to Washington, D. C., this spring and demonstrate.

The recruiters are currently en route to their assigned

cities or will arrive there, in the next four or five days.

The conference did not resolve when those indi-

viduals recruited to demonstrate would arrive in Washington, D.C.

King still plans on presenting his initial demands to the

Department of Labor. He also expects to make demands, not

resolved, on other Government departments.

King feels that his demands will not be met by

any Government agency and his massive civil disobedience

will then commence. The demonstrators will be instructed

not to abide by injunctions or other legal detérrents. They

will sleep in Government office buildings and submit to arrest

and jail. Other demonstrators will take

the place of those

jailed.

King,envisions that these demonstrations will

tie up all business in Washington, D. C., in a matter rit

a few days. King hopes the news of these demonstrations

traveling throughout the Nation will touch off simultaneous

demonstrations in the other "target citiës." Initially

the demonstrators will press for jobs and income; however,

King feels the peace issue will naturally become involved

and much support will be afforded the demonstrators in

Washington, D. C., by various peace groups. Because of

the demonstrations, King feels Congress Will be forced to

pass legislation favorable to Negroes.

King plans to visit each "taiget city" and talk

to demonstrators recruited about the project and boost

morale. In that regard, King plans to visit Washington, D. C.,

on February 8, 1968. He also

informed the conference he

would be in Washington; D: C.; for. the actual demonstrations:

The type of civil disobedience that the demon-

strators would use was not discussed during this conference.

Even though King indicated. that these demonstrations would

commence the last week in March, the source advised that

King has speaking engagements in several cities in Virginia

at that time. The source feels that the mass demonstrations

will not start until the first week in April.
