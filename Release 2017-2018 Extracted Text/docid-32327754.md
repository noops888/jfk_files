MM 105-1742

The Bureau will note that recent acts of

violence and threats attributed to PC are really acts

OF ORLANDO BOSCHAVILA and his organization, MIRR, using

the name PODER CUBANO. Miami Office is conducting an

intensive investigation of the MIRR concerning these re-

ported acts of violence.

Concerning the Cuban Nationalist Movement (CN),

U. S. Customs reports that the PEREZ-GARCIA faction is

maintainen

and his associates are inactive and have no plans for

the immediate future.

It is noted a New York informant recently

visited Miami and talked with JULIO PEREZ, who stated he

is no longer in the CNM.

This informant also talked with

RIVERO, and reported RIVERO's group is inactive.
