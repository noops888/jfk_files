On January 25, 1960, Plato Cacheris and Abraham

Poretz, Department of Justice

attorneys, held a conference

concerning the accounting examination of the records of

Exhibitors Service Company with Special Agent Edward W.

Pennypacker. During the conference reference was made to

the fact that the moneys sent by the company to Weinheimer

were transmitted via the minimum air mail and regular mail

postal rates. In this connection, Cacheris and Poretz

requested that consideration be given to a test being made

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether

twenty used bills of any denomination and a business size

envelope, as well as a letter size piece of paper or a

â€¢ small envelope either of which might have been utilized

as enclosures with the money, could have been sent through

the mails for the minimum postal rates.

Inasmuch as such a determination would be a

matter primarily a function

of the postal authorities

and

not the Federal Bureau of Investigation, no action in this

regard is being taken in absence of any further request.
