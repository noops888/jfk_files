the suicide of Mrs. GOLDSTON.

A communication in file

revealed that State had checked SABLACK's security file which

contained no adverse infornation.

U

Mr. SZLUK suggested and arranged an interview of

DI. LEWIS I. WOODWARD, Director, Medical Division, USDS, as of

possible assistance in this matter. On 1/11/65, Dr. WOODWARD

confidentially advised SA MORRISSEY that PICARD was

understandably stressed condition was aggravated somewhat by

his attenpt to doctor himself with various pills available. He

said that PICARD was presently under the care of a psychiatrist,

whose name he was confidentially offering to the Bureau only -

DI. JOHN S. KAFKA, 7834 Aberdeen Road, Bethesda, Md., telephone

PICARD's security file also contained an undated

"Limited Official Use" memo for the record which revealed that

a Mx. BRUCE VAN VOORST Of Newsweek met with Mr. DONHAUSER and

MC. WHITCHOUSE Of State on 3/24/64,

VAN VOORST had raised with Mr. WILLIAM LEWIS Of INR re the

conduct of PICARD in Zanzibar. VAN. VOORST said his bureau had

received into from a very high level Departmental source that

INr. PICARD had a bad record before his assignment to Zanzibar;

that he was an alcoholic; that he had insisted on evacuating his

Arab mistress on the USS Manley and that he was undergoing

psychiatric treatment. VAN VOORST was informed that PICARD was

assigned to Zanzibar on an excellent record; that he was not an

alcoholic, although they understood he drank more than an

average officer would, but his performance was good. They drew

attention to PICARD'S

success in negotiations re a tracking

station and his handling of Zanzibar's independence.

The

evacuation of the lady was justified. They admitted rumors of

a mistress, and said that PICARD suffered nervous exhaustion as

a result of his Zanzibar experiences and was brought back to

the Department.

Mr. VAN VOORST said the key elenent of the story was

PICARD's suitability for his Zanzibar assignment. If he had a

good record, subsequent nervous condition was understandable under

the circumstances.

He said he would report to Mr. BENJAMIN

BRADLEE (the Newsweek Bureau Chief) whose story this was and

it seemed likely BRADLEE would drop it. The above is being set

lorth for the information of the Bureau.

SECRET,

With respect to PICARD'S actions in Zanzibar, an

Official Informal Limited Official Use comnunication intended

for addressee only from Ambassador WILLIAM LEONIART, indicated

that PICARD conducted himself with courage and spirit; that the

American civilians who were evacuated on the USS Manley were

full of praise for him; that the four Anerican newsmen whom he

protected on 1/15 and 16/64 spoke with admiration for his efforts.

PICARD was clearly not making responsible decisions during these

five days lit LEONARI did not believe any real damage to our u

interests resulted.

In another connunication, LEONHART said

PICARD made the right decision at the right time.

PICARD's security file

contained a memo of conversation

dated 3/14/64, between PICARD and JOSEPH PALNER, II, Director

General of the foreign Service. The conversation occurred on

Mr. PALMER told PICARD that Department wished to be

entirely fair with him in investigating and passing judgment on

the questions which had been raised about his conduct and behavior;

that PICARD was complicating his own case by recent activities

such as the involvement in the GOLDSTEIN case and several reports

of his drinking.

Ms. PALMER urged PICARD to return to the hospital

for further observation and psychiatric care.

PICARD said he

would not go to the hospital since he felt it degrading; that

his own psychiairist, a Dr. RUBIN,

thought he was making progress

and did not regard further ho pitalization as necessary.

He

claimed he was purely a victim

of circumstances in connection

with the GOLDSTEIN affair.

He admitted he had been drinking

fairly heavily, was under heavy strain. He made clear his

resentment of not getting any recognition for his performance

during Zanzibar events.

The memo indicated that PALMER had the

impression of PICARD as a sick man who was undergoing great

psychological stresses and strains; that PICARD's bitterness

at Department's lack of recognition in his performance during

the Zanzibar evacuation seemed to color his entire attitude.

12/11/6, PICARD'S Foreign Service Record indicated

he applied on 3/29/55 for Russian language and area training.

Routine attempts to locate the security files of

her and PICARD

available to anyone, referring inquiry to the

Office of Personnel.

The security

however, through the courtesy of Mr. WALTER JESSOP of State

evaluation of his status with State Department.

U

Mrs. GOLDSTEIN'S security file was sealed, and

administrative clearance was necessary for it to be

The file was sealed at her request in accordance with

allovable procedure. The reason apparently for same is that

Mrs. GOLDSTEIN had a child born "out of wedlock" after her first

marriage ended in divorce.

The file contained no other information

The information also indicates that Mrs. GOLDSTEIN had acquirea

certain confidential information and that it was indicated that

A menorandus in 1ile dated April 27, 1066, indicated

that Picard's cocurity cleazance granted under provisions of

Department, advised Personnel that it had taken no action to

Pleard should not be considered for Foreign Service upon
