INIRDOICHCH

This review presents the facts and observationg which bear

on the bona fides of the soulet defector Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO.

The highlighta of NOSEiXO's biography, as he has given it to

CIA, are as follows:

He has born 30 October 1927, the first

son

of Ivan. Isidorovich NOSENYC, shipyard worker who in 1939 was to

become Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding.

After graduating in

1951

from the Institute of International Relations in Moscow, where

he specialized in international law and the English language,

NOSENKO entered the Chief Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the

Soviet Navy,

serving first as a translator assigned to the intel-

ligence staff of the Seventr. (Far Eastern) Fleet and then as a

senior translator and political officer

at an

intelligence unit

of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet.

In mid-March 1953,. Immediately

following STALIN's death, NOSENKO left the Naval GRU to become a

junior case officer in the KEB.

He was assigned to the U.S.

Embassy Section of the American. Department, KGB Secona Chief

Directorate, iron 1953 to mid-1955.

During this period he was

initially responsible for operational activity surrounding Am-

erican journalists in Moscow and later for operations against

U.S. Army Attaches at the Embassy.

when transferred to the newly

organized Tourist Department of

the second Chief Directorate in

1955, NOSENKO had as his targets vi itors to the Soviet Union

from the United States and the countries of the British Common

wealth.

Having handled a number of successful tourist opera-

tions, NOSENKO in 1958 was promoted to Deputy Chief of the

section responsible for operations against imerican, Sritish,

and Candian nationals.

Eighteen months later Ni-SENKO returned

to the U.S, Embassy Section as its Deputy Chiei.

Between January

1960 and January 1962 he was second-in-charge of all KGB activ-

ities against

the U,S, Embassy in Moscow and personally super-

vised operations against the Embassy Security Officer, the

Second Chief Directorate's most important counterintelligence

target at the time, and

against American code clerks, collec-

tively the Directorate's

most important recruitment targets.

At the end of December 1961 NOSENKO again was transferred to

the Tourist Department, this time as Chief of the American-

British-Canadian Section,

Six months later he was made Deputy

Chief of the Tourist Department, and in mid-1963 he became

II. SUMMARY OF CPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

A. Introduction

FIcu the CIA side, the NOSENKO case can be divided into

three periodas

the fiest Geneva phase of June 1962, the second

Geneva phase of January-February 1954, and the post-defection

The rcat of

Part II 18 separated irto these three periods accordingly.

B. First Geneva Phase (Jure 1962)

The NOSENKO case ocered on 5 June 1962 in the corridors of

the Palala des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations Dig-

armament Conference.

A ther-unidentified Soviet, known to him

by sight from conference neetings, approached Ü.S. Foreign Ser-

vice Officer David MARk with the suggestion that they get to

gether for a talk the folloring day.

In the late afternoon of

the same Soviet motioned !ARK aside and said that he

would like to taik to him privately as soon as possible.

told MARK that he was "not going to pump him for information,

but simply wanted to teli hin sone things."

A luncheon neeting

was arranged for 9 June, although the Soviet clearly preferred

an earlier date.

advised CIA of the appointment, explain-

ing that he thought the approach so unusual that it might be

an offer of cooperation or defection.

He said he believed the

Soviet to be Yuriy Ivanoviar NOSENKO, a member of the soviet

delegation to the arns talks.

At the 9 June luncheon with MARK, NOSENKO told MARK that

he, NUSENKO, was a KGB counterintelligence officer sent to

Geneva to ensure the security of the Soviet delegation.

He knew

that MARK had previously served in Moscow and believed he war

connected with American Irteiligence.* He needed approximately

900 Swiss francs immediately to cover KGB operational funds which

he squandered on liquor and a prostitute in Geneva, and he offered

for this amount to sell

tro pieces of information to American

Intelligence.

The first of these was the identity of a former

U.S. Embassy employee in Moscow who was a KGB agent and, as of

"near ciphers" in the hashington area; the second was

the identity of a soviet in boscow who.

although ostensibly a

CIA agent,

actually planted on American Intelligence.

though NOSENKO at fiist told Mirk that he would stop at

of these two items, he later stated:

"I know you won't let me

alone now," At another point NOSENKO said:

"I will not work in

Moscow, but I come out about once a year."

NOSENKO also gave

MARK a brief chronological account of his personal and profes

sional past.

MARK explained that although he was not an intel-

ligence officer, he could place NOSENKO in contact with the

Intelligence Chief in Geneva later that same day.

MARK Introduced NOSE:KO to a CIA officer at 2000 hours that

evening, and a three-nour

meeting

followed at a CIA safehouse in

Geneva.

Describing himseif as a KGB Major experienced in opera-

tions against the American Embassy in Moscow and against tourists

and other travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO told the CIA

the

KGB suspected MARK to be an American Intelligence officer:

sell two items of information.

He said that the need for money

suing discussion he said also that he sas dissatisfied with the

Despite this original reticence, NOSENKO supplied consider-

biographic information on himself and

also discussed in

general terms certain

additional KGB operations as well as KGb

organization and operational methods in Moscow.

He understood:

NOSENKO accompanied the Soviet delegation to a later ses-

sion of the Disarmament Conferenie lone having gone by in the

participation). arriving in Geneva on

next day he sent a cable to his CIA accom-

modation address announcing his presence.

At the first of the

series of meetings on 23 January he announced that he had

decided to defect to the United States citing as reasons his

continuing disaffection with the Soviet regime and the fact that

he probably would not have further opportunities to travel to the

West in the foreseeable future.

Post-Defection Handling (February 1964-Present)

On 4 February, four days before the date tentatively

selected for NOSENKO•s defection,

he reported that a cable had

been received from KGB Headquarters ordering his immediate re-

turn to participate in a KGB conference on foreign tourism to

cision was reached on Il February to bring. lOSENKO to the

United States, and in the early even.g of 12 February he and

his CIA escorts arrived in Washington via commercial aircrait,

thence to a safehouse in the Washington area®

At

the request of the Swiss and Soviet Governments, NOSENKO

met on 14 February with representatives of their respective

Washington Embassies in the offices of the U.S. Immigration and

Naturalization Service. He told both that he had defected of

his own free will after careful consideration and that he had no

desire to return to the Soviet Union.

In answer to the questions

of the Soviet representatives, he orally renounced his status and

rights as a citizen of the USSR.

CIA completed its initial debriefings of NOSENKO on 18 Febru-

ary.

and on 24 February he was introduced to representatives of

the

FBI for questioning. At about the same cime, there was a

marked decline in NOSENKO's discipline:

He became evasive and

uncooperative, refusing to answer some of the questions of his

debriefers, both CIA and FBI; his nightlife in Washington and

nearby cities was punctuated by drinking bouts, crude behavior,

and

disputes with his security escort.

He explained these

actions by saying that he was under great tension as a

result of

his defection, abandonment of his wife and children,

and the

disgrace that he had brought to his family name.

It was against

this

background that CIA acceded to NOSENKO's demand for a vaca-

tion.

During NOSENKO's absence, consultations were held with

the FBI concerning

steps to be taken to restrict his movements

and activities.

agencies feared that his behavior would

bring about unwanted attention and publicity, perhaps police

arrest, and that doubts about his bona fides, which were be-

coming known to a widening group of people in the u.S. Govern-

ment, might be inadvertently revealed to NOSENKO himself.

FBI on I April said it would "not interpose objection" to the

CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's freedom of movement.

The Acting

Attorney General, the Department of State, and the White House

were also notified of the CIA pian at this time.

In the morning of 4 April NOSENKO was driven to another

safehouse in a Washington suburb, ostensibly only. for a poly-

graph examination.

At the safehouse NOSENKO was given a rous

tine polygraph examination, lasting over three hours; he

told that he would remain at this safehouse, which

thenceforward was his regular place of residence.

Since this

Detailed interrogation of NOSENKO was begun on 4 April 1964

in order to obtain information which he had been reluctant to

give in debriefings, and to clarify contradictions in what he

had already reported.

This phase of the interrogations was termi

nated on 24 April 1964.

Despite the scarching nature of the questions and the im

plicit and explicit doubts

of his veracity, NOSENIO proved him-

Questioning of NOSENKO during the summer and

autumn of 1964

and the interrogations of January and February 1965 concentrated

on the period of his claimed service in the U.S. Embassy Section

of the American Department,

KGB Second Chief Directorate, from

January 1960 to January

Among the reasons for selecting

this particular period were the comparatively large amount of

collateral information available against which NOSENKO's state-

ments could be checked; the importance of the U.S. Embassy and

its personnel as the outstanding KGB Second Chief Directorate

targets; their importance from the standpoint of American

security; and the extent of NOSENKO's knowledge about the acti

vities of the U.S. Embassy Section, in his capacity as its

Deputy Chief.

CIA asked NOSENKO in

February 1965 to sign a series of interrogation reports, so-

called "protocols, " most of which concern the period of his

claimed service in the

American Department.

These were written

by the CIA interrogators, and they were designed to incorporate

NOSENRO's exact statements and meaning on various specific sub

Sects.

The protocols were in no way presented to POSENKO as

documentary portions of a "confesaion," but gather as distilled

and final statements of what he did and did not kres concerning

particular topics. NOSENKO was asked to read each page of each

protocol carefully and to sign his name at the bottom to indi

cate that he underatood and agend with its contents; he was

allowed the use of a dictionary and was permitted to ask any

guestions and make any changes that he wished.

(Arendments were

entered by the interrogators and were initialed by NOSENKO.)

NOSENKO was asked, after reading. each page and after completing

the entire protocol, whether he understood what was written there

and whether there were any more changes he wished to make.

He

was then asked to sign and date the statement, "I have read and

understood this report and certify it as correct." at the end of

the final page.

With one exception, which will be noted later,

he did so calmly and without objections, although on

one or two

of them he remarked that his statements were presented

in such

a manner as to make them look foolish; although invited to do

8o, he was not able to suggest any changes of fact or presenta-

tion which would make them more accurate.

Conmenting on the

use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said on 4 Narch 1965:

"My life story is absolutely

correct. Anytring I have signed

is absolutely correct. I absolutely understand what I am doing

when I am signing any paper.

This is an official document, and

I fuliy understand what I'm doing when I sign it as being

abso

lutely correct."

In May 1965 a CIA psychologist questioned NOSENKO in detail

on his life from birth until 1953, when he said he entered the

KGB, in an attempt to gain additional insights into his charac-

ter and personality.

3

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until 14 August

1965 with the participation of Peter DERYABIN, a former KGB offi-

cer.

These interrogations, the first to be held in Russian,

were for the purpose of using DERYABIN's first-hand experience

in the KGB to obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's per-

sonal and professional background.

There were no further debriefings or interrogations until

18 October 1966.

On this date NOSENKO was polygraphed on the

case of Lee Harvey OSWALD.

During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was questioned for

seven days on specific aspects of selected topics ranging from his

identity to his involvement in and knowledge of specific KGB opera-

Questioning was in both Russian and English.

OPERATIONAL CIRCCYSTANCES

A. Earlier Information on NOSENKO 1o Coneva

The first of these occurred in April 19f2.

At a cockenil

Party in Geneva, NOSE:KO met a female scoretary employed by the

British Foreign Office. He saw her

several days later in

tho

corridors of the Pilais des Nations and asked her to have dinner

with him, and a date was made for several evenings later. Ac-

cording to the sccretary's later account as reported by her

superiors:

"They talked about Marxism, the Chinese, Yugoslavia,

and love; NOSENKO was obviously smitten with her,

becane verbally

aborous,

and told her that he would like to take her off to a.

desert island."

The girl

felt that NOSENKO probably was not

Interested in

her for intelligence purposes, but seemed to be

renuinely attracted by her.

From her conversations

with YOSENKO

she was

able to report that "he had been in submarines during

the war and, according to himself, had risen to the rank of

Commander.

He was a senber of the Communist Party.

His father

was in the Ministry of Shipping.

He himself had served in the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1948 and 1949 and had apparently

visited England but had not been stationed there."

When NOSENKO became too

persistent in his attentions, the secretary reported

the contact

to her superiors,

was withdrawn

immedlatcly from Switzerland,

and later resigned fron the Foreign Offico.

*Although NOSENKO was described in roports (held by CIA) con-

cerning recruitment approaches to incricans in Moscow prior to

Ns first arrival in Geneva, there was no basis in these re-

ports to identify the Soviet described as NOSENKO.

NOSENKO did not appear in these earlier reports.

for NOSENKO's Presence In Geneva (1962 and 1964)

1.

TDY in 1962

When NOSENKO arrived in Geneva for the first time on

10 March 1962, he was listed officially as a Soviet Yinistry of

Foreign Affates "expost" with the Delegation to the disarmament

talks.

Early

durink liis second meeting with CIA on 11 June 1962,

NOSENKO was asked to oxplain precisely why he had been sent out

to Geneva.

He repllod as follows:

"Right now, I cane to pro-

vide counterintellisince support to the Disarmament Delegation..•

"This department," NOSENKO continued, "is concerned with

departures abroad, that is, it checks all Soviet citizens who

intend to travel abrond, both alone and as members of delegations.

an order that no

David MARk, belleved by the KGB to he a CIA officer,

NOSENKO reported, and on this basis the KGB suspected that

SHAKHOV might be an American agert.

NOSENKO described the

various ways he had tested these suspicions in Geneva. He

first gave SHAKHOV disinformation and looked for indications

that he passed it on to American contacts.

Next, SHAKHOV was

told to perforn countersurveillance tasks

during & meeting by

NOSENKO with an imaginary agent, while other KGB officers

checked for signs that SHAKHOV had forewarned the Americans

NOSENKO revealed to SHAKHOV the

location of a KGB

about the neeting' "dead drop" and checked back five days later

to see whether the specially prepared naterials which had been

placed in it had been disturbed

in any way.

NOSENKO's con-

clusion fron all this, he told CIA, was that SHAKHOV was ab-

solutely free of suspicion, and it was his intontion to report

this finding when he returned to KGB Headquarters.

On later occasions NOSENKO reported that SHAKHOV had

previously served with the Ministry. of foreign Affail's in the

United States and that during this period he acted as an agent

recruiter for the KGB.

In 1966 NOSENKO named one person whom

SHAKHOV had spotted and developed in the United Stated, f

SHAKHOV, according to NOSENXO,

was not and

never

haa been a KGB officer.

Asked why SHAKHOV was permitted to

travel abroad when he was suspected of being an American agent,

NOSENKO explained that since SHAKHOV belonged to the Ministry

o1 Foreign Affairs, the KGB could do nothing about his trips

abroad.

"There was no proof, only suspicions,"

and furtherrore,

SHAKHOV was a member of the personal staff of the head of the

Soviet Delegation, S.K. TSARAPKIN.

NOSENKO was questioned again about his 1962 assignment to

Geneva during

the February 1965

interrogations.

His

answers

were incorporated in a

"protocol" which NOSENKO certified as

being correct on 26 February 1965.

The protocol states:

"GRIBANOV had nothing at all to do with my assignment to Geneva

Deputy "Chief of the Second Chief Directorate that the SHAKHOT

investigation was the main reason for his assignment to Geneva

1n 1962, NOSENKO later in the day stated:

"My main task was to

check the security of the delegation, plus SHAKHOV. You can't

separate these tasks."

In this questioning NOSENKO described the basis for the

suspicions of SHAKHOV, the lack of results from

earlier inves

tigations, and his own preparation for this assignment.

He

said that as a representative of the Soviet Delegations De-

partment of the Second Chief Directorate, N.G.

SITNIKOV had

conducted investigations of SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but

SITNIKOV was unable to resolve the questions concerning him.

Because of the

failure of these early efforts, the KGB decided

to send "a senior guy" to the Disarmament talks in 1962, and

NOSENKO was chosen "to finish things up." Before leaving Mos-

cow in March 1962, NOSENKO therefore discussed the SHAKHOV

case with SITNIKOV and with one (fnu) LYALIN, the Soviet Dele-

gations Department officer in charge of the SHAKIIOV case; he

elso read various materials on the case,

including an investi

gative plan drawn up by LYALIN.

NOSENKO's description of these

proparations provided the basis for the questioning which

followed:

Question: Why was SHAKHOV under suspicion in June 1962?

NOSENKO:

He was working with different delegations at

different conferences and, being in Geneva,

it was noticed that there

was something which

can he described as a connection with David

MARK, who was considered a CIA officer.* Also,

little, little, little things before.

Question:

When did SHAKHOV and MARK first meet? How did

it begin?

NOSENKO:

In '60 or '61 there was a contact with MARK.

I don't remember who reported it.

The report

was maybe from SITNIKOV in Geneva.

All the KGB officers going there were told to

pay attention to him.

Question: What about the report?

NOSENKO:

Maybe the officers saw the two going to the

toilet.

Maybe there was a contact.

The file

said "maybe."

I was sent to Geneva to carry

not wanting to work as an agent.

2.

The 1964 TDY

NOSENKO's 1964 trip to Goneva,

commencing on 19 January, was

also in the capacity of security officer with the Soviet Dis

armament Delegation.

He said he was the only security officer

for the group, which consisted of about 25 persons, and again

he was officially listed as an "expert."

NOSENKO reported that

he had three or

four agents within the delegation and an equal

number of opcrational contacts.

The only person whom he was

Instructed to watch

was A.A.

TKACHEY,

an inter

preter, who had travelled to Austria in 1960 ard 1961 and who,

the KGB had noted, was in the habit of going about by hinsell.

Other than this, according to NOSENKO, his responsibilities

were general in nature.

NOSENKO explained during the February 1965 Interrogations

how he was selncted for this TDY.

The protocol he signed on

26 February 1965 states:

"GRIBANOV had absolutely nothing to

do with my assignment to Geneva in 1964.

The fitness report

on me for this trip was signed by [F.D.] BOBKOV.

After it had been decided that I would go, in

about the beginning of January 1961, (N.T.) ZUARIKOV, the Chief

of the Department,

suggested

that a case officer might not be

required with this delegation.

KHLOBUSTROV, PANCHENKO, and

[A.G.| KOVALENKO [Chief of the Tourist Department and NOSENKO's

Immediate supervisor supported me for the assignment as a

personal favor to me."

"ith regard to GRIBANOV's knowledge of

his assignment to Geneva this second time, NOSENKO said that he

feared that if GRIBANOV learned about the TDY he would have said,

-"What, again?" and would not have permitted him to go.

for this reason that NOSENKO did not discuss the trip

BANOV, he said, and he did not believe that GRIBANOV, in fact,

anything about it.

Motivations and Intentions of NOSENKO

l. Introduction

NOSENKO has not indicated that his professional status 1n

his standard of Iiving in the Soviet Union, or hig

tantly l1re prompted his to volunteer to Amerdean Tatelligence

in 1962 and to defcct to. the United States in 1964.

He initially

told CIA that he had been unusually successful during his ten

year career as a KGB counterintelligence officer; his closest

friends and the people whom he admired most were members of the

KGB; he enjoyed his work.

The NOSENKO faally held a high social

position, and their economic situation was "luxurious by Soviet

standards."

NOSENKO described his family life as close and

harmonious.

He spoke with fondess and pride about his

twO

daughters,

of his wife's tolerance

and understanding, of the

companionship she gave him:

He expressed love and a

sense of

responsibility for his widowed sother, who heavily depended

upon him after the death. of his father in 1956.

The

elder

NOSENKO won his son's aduiration

for haring worked his way up

from an apprentice pipefitter in a shipyard to the position of

Soviet Minister of

Shipbuilding.

The NOSENKO name is honored

in the home town of Nikolayevsk, where the shipyard has been

renamed for the former minister and where a statue of him has

been erected in the town square.

By his own account, NOSENKO

thus had had a rewarding home life and a successful and enjoy-

able career in the KGB.

'2. Collaboration in 1962

At the outset in 1962, NOSENKO said he wanted to limit his

reports to two items of information.

Before the first meeting

with CIA was over, he went beyond these two items to give de-

tails on the KGB Secand Chief Director.te and nther operations,

and he offered to meet again.

(Four more meetings ensued in

1962, with NOSENKO providing additional information on the KGB.)

He would not defect, NOSENKO said, unless his personal safety

was endangered by the KGB.

Motivations in coming to American

Intelligence,

according to NOSENKO, were his financial emergency

in Geneva and his disaffection for

the Soviet regime.

a. "

Readiness to Report to CIA

During his 9 June meeting with David MARK, NOSENKO said he

realized, even before talking to representatives of American

Intelligence, that they would not be satisfied with the two

items of information alone--he expected them to insist on more.

He was introduced by MARK to a CIA case officer later the same

day, and at the start of the meeting, the following dialogue

NOSENKO:

he understood NOSENKO had

been in the KGB since shortly after the war, NOSENKO,"

, without

further prompting, gave a detailed statement of his own personal

past and his professional career. In tills statement he described

his education, his service in the GRU, his entry into the KGB

and generally

the functions and operating techniques of the

various components of the KGB Second Chief Directorate in which

he had served, along

with the inclusive dates of his service

in each.

This account

was very similar to that given MARK

earlier

in the day.

Still without prompting, he discussed

several specific KGB operations against Americans inside

the

Soviet Union, one involving the recruitment of a Yale University

professor on

the basis of homosexual compromise and the other

an unsuccessful attempt to recruit an American code cleif.

NOSENKO said he was personally involved in both cases.*

The question of his further assistance was then raised

again:

The CIA officer asked NOSENKO to tell more about the

Yale

professor, but NOSENKO demurred, stressing that the agree-

ment involved only two pieces of information and ignoring the

fact that he had already given

considerably more:

NOSENKO :•

tell you only these two cases which I wanted to

tell you, and it is enough for this day.

This exchange was followed by a lengthy description of the two

leads which NOSENKO had come to sell; the BELITSKIY and the

"ANDREY" cases.:

AS NOSENKO was about to leave this first meeting, his case

officer asked when they might meet again.

NOSENKO suggested

that they meet two days later, on Monday, around noontime as

it would be easier for him to get away unnoticed at lunchtime.

He then said that the case officer was probably trying to get

everything down on tape and asked that this be stopped because

of the risk to his security resulting from such a permanent re

cord of their conversations.

NOSENKO said:

"I will not tell

you anything particularly.interesting.

thing.

But not today. I can tell how LANGELLE blew POPOV--not

LANGELLE, but because of whom and why we found him-for your

sometimes voiced moral compunctions, from

this point on NOSENKO

expressed his primary personal concern as being his own secu

Do..

Attitude Toward Defection

While willing to meet with CIA representatives during

future trips outside the Soviet Union, which he estimated would

occur about once a year, NOSENKO in 1962 refused

to consider

defection except in circumstances where his

personal security

would be endangered.

Iris devotion to his wife and children and

the probability that the KGB would take reprisals against them

if he fled were, he said, the primary considerations behind this

(Without elaborating or the reasons, NOSENKO said on

occasion that he would not want to leave the U'SSR even

on a permanent KGB assignment and accompanied by his family.)

Other considerations included his widowed mother's dependence

on him and his love of Russia and the Russian people, as opposed

to the regime.

For these reasons, NOSENKO said, he could not

defect as PETROV, GOLITSYN, and KIOKLO! had done.

C. Motivation

NOSENKO told David MARK on 9 June 1962

the loss of KGB opsrational funds, for which he had to account

prior to his imminent departure for the Soviet Union.

needed to cover the loss was 900 Swiss francs, or about $210,

and this was the price asked for the information.

NOSENKO'g statements of motivation to his CIA case officers

during subsequent meetings are given below:

9 June 1962: In his first meeting with a CIA officer NO-

SENKO. asked whether MARK had relayed the reasons why he wanted

to meet with American Intelligence.

He then very briefly re

peated what he had told MARK concerning the loss of his opera

tional funds.

The case officer remarked that there must be

something more to it, upon which NOSENKO said that this was not,

in fact, his main motivation:

11 June 1962: During the second meeting, NOSENKO himself

raised the issue of motivation.

His case officer had just said

that CIA would respect his wishes in connection with a particu

lar reguest when NOSENKO said:

This means that there are great mistakes. Well,

that's all.

What did you want to ask me, please?"

At the close of this meeting, NOSENKO stressed that money

was unimportant as a motive for a continuing relationship:

14 June 1962:

The subject of motivation was not discussed

during the third and fourth meetings with NOSENKO.

As he was

about to leave the Geneva safehouse after the fifth and final

session, however. NOSENKO again touched on the economic inequi-

ties existing inside the Soviet Union and raised a new reason for

cooperating with CIA, his basic sympathy for the American people.

NOSENKO said that he rcalized that the reason he

had given for

coming to us, his need for money, was "not good."

Before he

officers parted, NOSEiKO said, he

wanted to em

phasize "without attempting to justify himself" that he had

"always felt a certain sympathy toward the American people." He

explained that it was not the technical progress of the United

States which attracted him, nor was it the high standard of

living of the

Americar people.

It was rather the openness and

directness with which the Americans whom he had met and seen

handled thenselves.

As examples he cited his American targets

in Moscow and Secretary of State Dean RUSK, whom he had

seen in

Geneva.

Although NOSENKO did mention the difficult economic situa

in the USSR on a few other occasions, he did not relate

these remarks specifically to his motives for volunteering to

The above excerpts are representative of his total state

3. Decision to Defect (January 1964)

On arrival for his first neeting with CIA during the second

Geneva phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that after long

and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting series, he had

decided to defect.

He once again criticized the Communist regime

along the same lines as during earlier meetings, but his immedi

ate motivation seemed to have nothing to do with this:

explained that he had recently been promoted to the position of

First Deputy Chief of the Seventh (Tourist) Department of the KGB

Second Chief Directorate, and that because of the stature and

responsibilities of his new job, there would be fw opportunities,

for him to visit the West in the future.

Therefore, he

had decided to seize the opportunity at hand and to flee to

United States at once, leaving his family behind.' He foresaw no

possibility of his wife and children being permitted to leave the

UsSR for the "next twenty years."

NOSENKO told CIA that «the

hardest thing is to part with my family." He had, however, care-

Eully considered their fate as the close relatives of a defector.

and he knew that, because of his mother's position in Soviet so-'

ciety, no harm would come to them.

Whereas NOSENKO declared his intent to defect immediately,

the CIA case officers at this first meeting in 1964 persuaded

him to remain in place for at least two or three weeks on the

grounds that, first, CIA would benefit much from this; and

second, arrangements for his transfer to and reception in the

United States would have to be coordinated in advance with CIA

Headquarters.

During this first reeting NOSENKO made no monetary request

of CIA and asked only for reasonable assurance of a secure future

in the United States.

In this cornection, he said, he would

prefer to act as a ClA consultant, particularly on counterintel

ligence matters because he was a

recruiting other Soviets.

The next five meetings with NOSENKO were devoted exclusively

to debriefings on the activities of the KJB Second Chief Direc

torate.

Althogh his

impending defection was mentioned, his

reasons for taking this step were noi discussed.

In the mean

time, NOSENKO's first CIA handlar Elew to Washington for dis-

cussions regarding the defection and, on his return, told

NOSEiKO that the CIA leadership had asked why,

about this, NOSENKO con-

firmed that

this was his reason;

and added:

"I hay never have

another chance, and

in addition, l've had

sufficient time since

our last meeting here in Geneva (1962] to weigh everything and to

consider everything."

Later in this same meeting, NOSENKO again

mentioned his lack of interest in money and his

feelings about

deserting his family:

"I understand Ithat it will be difficult

to adjust to a new life in Anerical and know

that for some time

I will be sick within.

And I know that a certain perica of

time must elapse before this can heal. I ever spoke to you

bluntly about my (financial) security.

I am absolutely un-

mercenary and have never had any appreciation for money or

wealth...My most difficult and sorest spot of all is my family.

This is

the nost basic and most difficult spot of all. And I

know perfectly well that I must go through an

illness over

this.

For this the only and the best doctor is time.

I don't

expect to have a new family there.

Of course, I don't know-

but at least I'm speaking from the way I feel

now.

I have a

strong liking

for children--not only

for my

own,

but for all

children and, losing my own, I am

fully conscious how I must

suffer through this.

In time I will get used to it.

I know

one can get used to almost anvthina."

At this meeting, NOSENKO agreed to remain in place for

approximately another week,

and the tentative date of 8 Febru

ary was selected for the defection.

NOSENKO's motives for the defection were not mentioned

for five more meetings. Then, on 4 February 1964, he telephoned

the Geneva safehouse to say he wanted to defect at once.

riving shortly thereafter, he announced that he had been or-

dered to return to Moscow

the following day and, therefore, had

to leave Switzerland before morning.

He stated his reasons

formally in an asylum request, written at the time:

This decision was made by me, not now, at the

moment I write this Inquest, but several years ago.

Having worked for many

years in the RGB and knowing

more than the average

joviet citizen about the policy of

government has chosen to take, and about the law and

order in the USSR, I have come to the decision that

4. The letter of July 1956

The most complete explanation given by NOSENKO of his

motives for first contacting CIA and later defecting to the

United States is contained in a letter to his CIA case officer

in July 1964:

He described this letter as "an exposition of

all those reasons and

root causes which led to the decision

to leave the soviet Union" and further explained that "every

thing put down here is lacking in a whole series of lesser

details which to a greater or lesser degree played their

role."

Nevertheless,

he said, he had tried in this letter

"to set down the main things to show how, when, and why the

decision was born,

grew,

and hardened within me to conpletely

alter the course of my

life."

This letter is preserted below

in its entirety.

Most of the bioçraphical and operational

details mentioned in the letter are covered separately in other

parts of this paper.

My life, my childhood and youth passed in

very comfortable circumstances since the position of

my father gave us the opportunity to live without lacking

for anything. And the only difficult periods of my

life (before

the death of my father) were:

study in

the naval schools in kuybyshev, Baku and Leningrad;

and the beginning of my working life, the period in

the Far East (1950-1952) •

The opportunity to be

always well-dressed, to have a sufficient amount

of money, to have my own car, to be able to use the

car given me by my family and also my father's car,

the opportunity to travel to the South and to vaca-

tion in the best sanitariums,

dachag, and so forth;

all this unquestionably left its mark on me and be-

came something of a habit.

After the death of ny

father, my successful progress in my work gave me a

higher

which

salary,

and although I did not have all that

I had while my father was alive,

still I did not

experience any serious difficulties.

But already I

wanted to live still better.

"2.

Up to 1953, over the course of my entire

life-at school,

in

the Institute, at work, at home

in the

family--it was

always pounded into my head

that STALIN was a great genius, that he was good, keen,

etc., and the thought never occurred to me to question

his words or his deeds because everything that he

said, and everything he did, were completely axiomatic.

The arrestsand trials only involved traitors and it

was considered and explained that the people who

suffered innocently, especially in 1937 and 1938,

suffered only because at the head of the NKVD in 1937,

1938, was the betrayor of the people YEZHOV.

Not

even

the shadow of doubt fell on the name of STALIN.

Soon after STALIN's death in 1953 I read a certain

document given me by my father.

a secret

letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the

"case of the doctors;" it was not addressed to all

conmunists but only to members and candidate members

of the Central Committee.

I was deeply shaken by this

letter which described in detail how these people,

The cult of STALiN and much that I heard in the KGB

about the reign of STALIN, all this left its mark and

forced me to think deeply

about the real truth and to

look at everything more critically.

Already I no

longer had faith

in all those ideas which for years

had been pressed into my head.

"3.

The new leaders (KHRUSHCHEV and Company)

used the same

methods but already diluted with the

water of democracy, with playing up to the people

and

attempts

to convince them that a new era would

arise, a new and better life, and that now the Party

was always

going to concern itself with the welfare

of the people.

In fact,

it was a struggle for power

and the use of all means in this struggle, even

microphones (they

listened to the conversations of

BERIYA and his friends; later they listened to the

conversations of MOLOTOV, MALENKOV, KAGANOVICH, and

others). KHRUSHCHEV's endless blabbing about suc-

cesses,

when in fact

they didn't exist, the figures

about how

the UsSR had. passed the USA ir the produc

tion of butter and milk, when in the stores they were

available only infrequently.

The endless promises

of a better life when

in fact nothing of the sort is

taking place.

All this similarly forced me to re-

evaluate not only the events which were

taking place

in the country, but already the entire idcology of

the Party, its external and internal course.

"4.

The events in Novocherkassk where about 20,000

to 25,000 people rose up and the way in which this

popular indignation was suppressed by troops with many

casualties.

This also made a deep impression

on me.

When I was resting in the summer of 1961 in Nikolayev,

from my relatives-my father's brothers--I understood

well the real relation of the workers both to the

leadership and to the Party as a whole.

At the same

time I saw how the workers really lived, how they eat,

what they have and what they san buy with their wages.

"5. I heard a great deal from my father about

the domestic policies of KHRUSHCHEV in regard to the

development and the course of constructior in industry,

about his complete illiteracy in engineering techno-

logy and industrial economics, about incorrect deci-

sions in regard to many industries, and this was not

only the opinion of my father, but also of other impor

tant leaders in various fields of industry (MALYSHEV,

VANNIKOV, AKOPOV, and others). But no one dared to

open his mouth and when in December 1955 my father

tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain deci-

sion would be incorrect, he received such a rebuff

from KHRUSHCHEV. that he was profoundly shaken and in

the opinion of my mother this brought him to his ill

ness in 1956 and his death in August 1956.

"The events in Germany and especially.in i

Hungary showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy

of communist ideology.

What was especially important

for me was the fact that in these countries it was

a protest not of individuals or groups,

but of the

entire people who could no longer endure a regime

imposed on them by force.

Here it is necessary to

emphasize that the life of the people in these coun

tries was much better than that of the people in the

USSR (I saw for myself how people live in Czecho-

slovakia, in Germany, and beyond any doubt they live

better than the entire people of the Soviet Union).

The split of the international communist

movement became for me a clear fact and confirmed

my opinion that the theory of communism is a theory

büilt on sand and that it is practiced according to

the needs of the leadership of the Party at a given

stage of life and that in reality full material wel-

fare would never be enjoyed by the people but only

by the leadership and the Party and

the government.

" 8.

Working in the KGB I came to understand

much and became conscious of the contradiction between

the

internal and external course of the USSR.

Such

questions as disarmament, the

ban on atomic weapons, the

position of the USSR in the United Nations-all these

are used only in the interest of propaganda and as

a screen for carrying out of the policies needed by

the cormunist party.

(I was myself present at the

negotiations in Geneva and saw the

'politics" of the

Soviet delegation.)

"9.

My trips abroad opened my eyes wide to the

true reality.

With my own eyes, I saw how people

live, how much they earn!

how they can dress and live

on their wages, and I paid special attention to the

life of ordinary people and not to that of scientists,

engineers, etc.

And all the propaganda about the

enormous armies of unemployed in the countries. un

of the

West, about the

'heavy exploitation', and the

believably difiicult life' flew immediately out of

my head.

And that which I met with in my work, the

sending of Soviet citizens abroad--who gets sent where

and how, etc.--this finally debunked this propaganda.

Many of my acquaintances--GUK, CHURANOV and others-

think back with great pleasure about life abroad.

I entered the KOMSOMOL completely without

thinking about it.

time came, the right age, and.

I became a Komsomolnik like all the others. It was

different in regards to the Party: I joined the Party

in 1956 after the death of STALIN and while I was

working in the KGB and already at that time there was

a lack of faith and

indecisiveness in me.

My father

continually insisted on this, saying that without the

Party I would never move ahead and would not have

success in life.

But I myself understood and saw

that I would not be able to work in the KGB unless I

ilas a member of the Party.. And if I worked somewhere

else, I would truly never move ahead in my career

My mother many times offered to divide all- this in

"15. Being in Geneva in 1962,

not long before

my departure I myself of my own desire entered into

contact with you.

The reason for this was the loss

of money received by me for operational expenses.

I

would have been unable to accumulate such a sum of

money before my departure and there was nobody to

borrow from (at this time GUk was hinself in finan

cial difficulty

and at the same time he was already

preparing for his return home).

To tell the truth

about the loss of the money would have meant that it

would be necessary to explain whore and in what cir-

cumstances it had been lost. This would have risked

expulsion

from the KGB and a serious reprimand from

the Party.

Not to tell the truth,

to think up some

sort of a story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of

all, they might think that I had appropriated the

money, that is, stolen it.

And this would be for me

the worst of all and I would, of course, in such

event have told the truth.

To tell the truth, it was only after my

return home from Geneva in

1962 that I gradually, not

immediately, began fully to realize all the seriousness

of my contact with you and its full meaning.

although I did not give you any promises or assurances

about our continued contact in the future, I under-

sooner or later would set yourself the

task of continuing our contact.

And here it was that'

weighing up all the reasons and causes which I have

indicated above that in 1962 I took for myself the

decision to leave the USSR at the first opportunity

and that I started to work towards being sent on a trip

"17.

Of course, I wanted to come abroad with some

sort of 'baggage',

that is, with materials which could

be useful and necessary for you.

In this entire period

up to

January 1964

I tried to collect information which

would be of the maximum value for you.

My assignment

to the position of deputy chief of the Seventh Depart-

ment in July 1962 gave me a greater opportunity than

before.

But

at the same time this assignment almost

excluded the possibillty of a trip abroad ard it vas

inly with great difficulty that I was able to get away

for the trip in January 1964. It was necessary to con

vince CHEL.VOKOV and then to ask CHELNOKOV to convince

BOBKOV and in 1963 to convince KOVALENKO.

In this I

advanced many reasons:

that I had not spent all the

money (in foreign currency); that the medicine which

I bought for my daughter had proven very successful

and that I needed to buy some more medicine to carsy

out one more series of treatments; that this trip

would not be a long one and

that since I was already

the deputy chief of the Department I would not be able

to travel abroad any more and so, therefore, this trip

would probably be my last.

Of course, all this was

said at convenient moments and outside of work.

Things were easier with the Eleventh Department (which

deals with trips abroad) because I was on good termg

with PENCHENKO who covered Switzerland, besides which

when I came back from Geneva in 1962 I had brought him

a number of presents.

"18.

The publication in 1963 by the foreign press

of the "ASSALI, case put me on my guard since in the

newspaper Times it said outright that the English

learned about him thanks to the Americans who learned

about VASSALL in the spring of 1962.

Fortunately, the

leadership of the FCD,as I learned from GUK, CHURANOV,

and TARABRIN, came to the conclusion

that here the

Americans had been helped by GOLIZSYN.

But at the

same time the FCD was not completely sure of this.

But the publication in the American press of Alsop's

articles on the CIA alarmed me extremely.

This ar

ticle in one spot said plainly that as far as is known

the KGB does not have any gources in the CIA while at

the same time the CIA has penetrated the KGB.

From

this moment, I do not conceal this tact, I began to

feel afraid

that the KGB would somehow learn of my con

tact

with you.

During the closed trial of PENKOVSKIY I

of an initial opinion of him.

PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial;

I liked his

been said in the KGB about him and the sort of person

they were trying to make him out to be (that he was

morally degraded, that he had descended and sunk into

a swamp) that all this was nonsense, bluff, and chatter.

And PENKOVSKIY,

the same as GOLITSYN, gave

Introduction

The extent to which NOSENKO made himself available for

meetings with CIA in Ceneva in 1962 and 1964 is reviewed here

in connection with his statements about the KGB duties assigned

to him for these trips, his visits to the KGB Legal Residency,

and his personal association with

other Soviets.

NOSENKO was not precise about how he spent his

days and nights

in Geneva, he did indicate that he was his own

2. Official Duties in Goneva

In 1962 NOSENKO said he was the sole KGB officer in the

94-man Soviet delegation to the Disarmament Conference

such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the

entire delegation.*

assist him in carrying out these security

officer functions, NOSENKO had the services of a number of

coopted informants of the KGB who were serving in the delega-

In addition, NOSENKO had the specific mission of check-

ing on suspicions

attached to one of the delegation members,

SHAKHOv** but by the time he established contact with CIA,

he said, this assignment had already been completed.

In 1964, NOSENKO said his only operational task then was to

handle the general security

responsibilities for the Soviet

delegation, as he hac done

in 1962.

There was no specific

mission such as the one concerning SHAKHOV in 1962.

NOSENKO has described his investigations of SHAKHOV, but

he has never indicated either that he conducted security checks

of other delegation members in 1962 and 1954, or that he re-

ceived any security-type information (except on SHAKHOV) from

the KGB cooptees who were supposed to be reporting to him.

3. Visits to the KG3 Legal Residency

Virtually

every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to

the KGB Lecal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for

more than a day or two,

the Legal Resident, S. I. GAVRICHEV,

would invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself.

I.S. MAYOROV and M.S. ISYMBAL also arrived with the delega-

zion in March 1952 but had left Geneva by the time NOSENKO

contacted CIA.

SHAKOV is discussed further in Part IIi. J.:.

1SP CRORES

## Page 55

GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated him with deference,

and "shortly after HIs arrival in Geneva In March 1962,-NOSENKO"

gave a lecture on counterintelligence to the assembled members

of the Legal Residency.

This lecture was given at GAVRICHEV'5

request, although it was only after some hesitation on the part

of the Legal Resident that all of his subordinates were brought

together to heat NOSENKO.

(In return for helping the Legal

Residency to perform counter-surveillance on several occasions,

NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed by CAVRICiEV to have the

use of an operational car and driver to go shopping and carry

out other private errands.)

Similarly, in 1964, NOSENKO said he was making nearly daily

visits

to the Legal Residency.

During the 1964 meetings NOSENKO

stated that it was his close relationship with M.S. ISYMBAL*

which made it possible for him to have visited the Ceneva Legal

Residency so frequently, both in 1962 and 1964.

"According to

the strict rules.

"an officer in a status

such as mine should not even go to the Residency.

In this case

it is only because I am deputy chief of a department and GAV-.

RICHEV knows my position perfectly well (it is not lower than

his, and because

I have such a sympathetic personal relation-

ship

with TSYMBAL."

He then went on to say that SYMBAL "sort

of escorted me to the Residency.

They could have simply said:

"You are here or a mission, we have our own mission, and we

have nothing in common.'"

But, NOSENKO indicated, this was

not the case, thanks to TSYMBAL's intervention.

4. Association with TSYMBAL

At the secord meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO volunteered

information on TSYMBAL's KGB background and his current missions

in Geneva,

then alluded to his having spoken with TSYMBAL in

Ceneva but without placing any particular emphasis on this

relationship.

In 1964, however, NOSENKO claimed that their relationship

was close,

explained that it was TSYMBAL (again in Geneva at

the same time) no gained NOSENKO's admission to the Legal

Residency,

and said that he had twice gone to see TSYMBAL off

on train trips, once on 24 January when TSYMBAL wert to Bern

and again on 28 January when TSYMBAL left Lausanne for Rome.

NOSENKO told CiA he had been dealing with TSYMBAL since 1960

or 1961.

At that time

"We were looking over some candidates

for recruitment and came across

some whose background would

have made them suitable for the Special (Illegals)

Director-

ate... Then

when we came (here) in 1962 for the Disarmament

Conference, I got to know him a little better - more from the

human side. He seemed to take a liking

to me for sore reason.

We had met in Moscow before, of

course, but just in the hall

or in the dining room.

He used to say:

and I would answer: "Well, it's kind of awkward for me to

hang around the Special Directorate - what am I supposed to be

doing here?' He would say: 'Oh, comeon, stop in. ' But I

5859 15°

TSYMBAL appeared in Geneva under the last-name alias

"ROGOV" and was identified by NOSENKO as Chief of the

Illegals Directorate, KGB First Chief Directorate.

COLITSYN reported in 1961 that TSYMBAL was

Chief of the European Department, KGB First Chief

Directorate..

didn't." NOSENKO also said that ISYMBAL had asked him several

times to transfer to the First Chief Directorate and had

suggested that he might be assigned to the United States.

In

fact, Nosaurs added, he had got into some difficaty with o. Mo

leaving the impression with GRIBAJOV that NOSENKO (who was still

in Geneva) had agreed to this action.

questioned in April 1964 about his association with TSYMBAL,

NOSENKO stated that he met TSYMBAL. for the first time several

days before their departure for Geneva.

Besides saying again

that he saw TSYMBAL, almost daily at the Legal Residency and

that TSYMBAL's assistance enabled him to enter the Legal Resi

dency, NOSENKO reported that in 1962 he went out with TSYMBAL

several times a week to

eat lunch or dinner; sometimes they were

joined by I. S. MAYOROV, * sometimes by h. K. KISLOV (see next

section), and sometimes the two ate alone.

During the 1966

interrogations, NOSENKO said that, while he had seen TSYMBAL

on a daily basis in 1962, he saw him only twice in 1964: once

when TSYMBAL travelled to Geneva

from Bern for ore or two days

and later when NOSENKO saw TSYMBAL off for Rome from Lauranne.

5. Association with Other Soviets

NOSENKO said in 1962 that the other Soviets he saw most

often were A. K. KISLOV and Yu. I. GUK.**

KISLOV, with NOSENKO

was one of the four members of the Soviet delegation staying

at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva, and was said to be head of the

American Section of TASS and a genuine correspordent.*** During

the 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO reported

that KISLOV was

not a KGB officer and made no reference of his having any

affiliation with the KGB.

NOSENKO dia say, however, that he

had arranged for KISLOV's name to be given the KGB double

agent B. Ye. BELITSKIY**** to use as a notional source of

information on Soviet disarmament policy: BELITSKIY was to

pass this information to his CIA contacts.

NOSENKO made

numerous references to drinking and carousing with KISLOV,

specifically with regard to a night in early June - when

NOSENKO was robbed of or squandered his operational funds,

which brought him to CIA - and on the night of 10 June 1962

when NOSENKC squandered 2000 Swiss francs

on wine and women. *****

In

giving NosE To the

money to defray these personal expenses, the CIA handlers

expressed to him their concern over the dangers to his security

arising from KISLOV's knowledge of this inexplicable source of

income..

NOSENKO replied that there was no need to be concerned:

since KISLOV was' "too drunk to know what is going on," and in

any event he constituted no threat.

* *

MAYOROV, according to NOSENKO, was visiting Geneva in

order to have operational meetings with agents.

Both KISLOV and GUK are mentioned in the discussion of

the "ANDREY" case (see Part VI.D. 3.b.).

GUK was also a

friend of GOLITSYN,

who reported extensively on Guk'g

career in the KC3 including his service in the United

## Page 57

"IT 1964" NOSEs"confirmed"that he had spent much time with

KISLOV in Geneva two years before and that they had become

very friendly.

For the firs. time, NCSENKO reported that

KISLOV had beer. a KGB operational contact while in the United

States, that he had been introduced to KISLOV by a KGB officer

in Moscow prior to his departure for Geneva in 1962 in order

that after returning from Geneva KISLOV had been recruited as

a KGB agent on the basis of a favorable report NOSENKO had

prepared.

Often during the 1962 meetings NOSENKO spoke of his "big,

big friend" GUk, wnom he described as the Deputy Legal Resident

in Geneva

and the only "strong officer" in the KGB Legal Resi-

dency.

He implied that his friendship with GJK, a former member

of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, was of longstanding.

NOS-

ENKO related that he and GUK were together nearly every day in

Geneva.

They often went out together to chat and have a few

drinks,

and as a corsequence, NOSENKO was able to elicit infor-

mation about some of GUK's operations there.

In 1964 NOSENKO

told CIA he found it difficult to obtain information on the

activities of the Geneva Legal Residency because le no longer

had a good friend there like CUK, who had been reassigned to

KGB Headquarters.

When questioned later in 1964 about his

relationship with GUK, NOSEUKO said he had come to know GUK

well only during his 1962 IDY in Geneva.

6. Availability for Meetings with CIA

In speaking to David MARK on 6 June 1962, NOSENKO expressed

displeasure over MARK's insistence on deferring their luncheon

(at which NOSENKO sought contact with American Intelligence)

the first meeting with CIA did

take place on 9 June 1962, NOSENKO stayed for three hours.

and it was at his suggestion that another meeting was scheduled

for 11 June. This second meeting in 1962 lasted seven hours.

E. Tining of Defection

After telling CIA on 24 January 1964 of his decision to

defect,

NOSENKO at the sane meeting concurred when CIA gave

operational and administrative reasons for hit to stay. in

place until the middle of February.

Dutirg the weok that fol-

lowed, the date of the defection was moved up to & february

in accordance with NOSENiO's wishes and with his repores in

dicating that less information of value would be forthconing

than ClA had at first thought.

On A February, however for a

NOSENNO reported that he was being recalled to Moscow

conference en tureign tourism in the USSR,

and he therefore

placed himself in CIA custody on that date.*

Details on

the tining

of NOSENKO's defection are given in the following

paragraphs.

At the 24 January

nceting the CIA case officers agreed

in principle with NOSENKO's decision to defect. NOSENKO

felt that it would be best for hin to disappear from Geneva

without a trace, leaving all his personal possessions be-

hind: he assured

that CIA could exfiltrate hin from Switzer-

land to the United States.

Ile wanted to carry out this

plan as soon as possible,

but the ciA officers encouraged

him--and NOSEiO agreed..to

remain in place for at least

three weeks more. The reasons given NOSENKO for this re-

quest were:

- The desire to get information on the local KGB

Legal Residency

and the Soviet delegation to the Dis-

armanent Conference while he still has access to this

infornation;

• The value of having NOSENKO present when O.M.

GRIBANOV made a visit to Geneva about 7 February a

visit known to CIA only through NOSENKO;**

• The necessity of making arrangements, accept-

able to NOSENKO, for his defection and resettlement.

The events which followed NOSENKO's agreement to remain

in placo for a short time longer are chronicled below:

The report of NOSENKO's recall to Moscow for the con-

ference on tourism is discussed further in Part III.F.

** GRIBANOV was in 1964 the Chief of the KGB Second Chief

Directorate and,

according to NOSENKO and other sources,

the sponsor ef NOSENKO's rapid

rise in State Security.

Several Mata sources, have reported that GRIBANOV

was fired from the KGB as a

result of NOSENKO's de-

fection (Pare 11l.l.).

NOSENKO'S relationship with

GRIBANOV is discussed in Part V.H.

## Page 59

26 January, 1964: In a three-and-a-half hour meeting,

NOSENKO emphasized that although he agreed that it was

necessary and useful for him to remain

in place until the

GRIBANOV Visit to Geneva, he wanted to defect as soon as

possible thereafter.

28 January 1964:

NOSENKO reported that GRIBANOV might

not. be coming to Geneva after all, for KGB Chairmar

SEMICHASTNYY was apparently reluctant to permit hin to

travel beyond Vienna.

NOSENKO said that he would probably

have definite information on GRIBANOV's trip by the end

of the week.

30 January 1964: At the seventh meeting of the series.

NOSENKO said that there now appeared to be littie likeiihood

that GRIBANOV would visit Geneva or Paris.*

Therefore, he

wanted to defect right away.

As reasons he cited the

enotional strain of any further delay

and the fact.that he

and his case officers were wasting their time working

against the docad nob Legal Residency, which had no worth

while or promising targets.

Ile also felt that nothing o

value could be obtained

from the Soviet delegation because

"TSARAPKIN himself doesn't know what he will sav until he

is told by Moscow the day before,"

As the best time for

the followin

Monday.

This date was tentatively scheduled, and NOSENKO

again

repeated his desire simply to "disappear without a

trace."

He also asked about exfiltration plans.

31 January 1964:

He repeated his willingness to remain

in place until the arrival of the CHEREPANOV Papers, which

he was told were enroute from Washington. He explained that

he had felt pressure at the previous

meeting because of an

imminent move by the delegation

its hotel to the Soviet

villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappearance would

be noticed more quickly.

This move, he had now learned, had

been postponed pending the arrival of a housekeeping officer

from Moscow.

From-* to 10 February 1964 GRIBANOV was in Paris, where

he was seen on the street with a Soviet identified by

NOSENKO as a KGB counterintelligence officer.. There is

no evidence that he visited Switzerland®

Aftor arriving he

of the Disarnament Conference,

he read a cable ordering him to return to Moscoy innediately

NOSENiO to fly to lloscow via laris the following day, and a

replacement has being readied to assume HOSENKO's duties as

nor. told who the icplacement could be.

Before he had left

for Geneva in January, NOSENKO then related, the Soviet Govern-

ment had been deliberating the question of expanding foreign

tourism in the USSR

and had

agreci! to open a nunber of new

citios and tourist itineraries

in this connection,

SEMICHASTNYY

had now docided that it was tine to

cäll a conference to

discuss new

"tactics and strategies" for handling

the in

creasoú number of tourists expected.

Since NOSENKO had been

placed in charge uf

thie entire conference, he was directed

to leave at once to propare

a basic report on the KGs handling

of tourists; the report wooid be read to the conference either

by hinsulf or by soreone fron the leadership of the KGB or

the Second Chief Directorate.

JOSENKO explained that he was

the only

one who could do this job as Lt. Col. A.G. KOVALENKO,

the KGB Headquarters Department senior officer, was a rel-

atively now man in this line of operations, having been

there only four or five years, perhaps less.

NOSENKO also

told CIA that "by great coincidence"

he had learned, just be-

fore the cable arrived, he was being moved to the Soviet

villa on the morning of 5 February.

Ile had arranged for a

Soviet chauffeur to bring a car around at 0930 hours the

next morning for the move.

His absence would be noted at

that tire.

and therefore

"the main thing is to cross the Swiss

border before morning."

NOSENKO felt, nowever, that there

would be considerable

confusion among the Soviets in Geneva

for a time following his disappearance, and that there would

be no real concern until the evening..

To foster Soviet un-

certainty he had left his clothing lying around his hotel

room and had brought no personal effects to the CIA safe-

house.

NOSENKO estimated the first Soviet queries to Swiss

NOSENKO was driven to Frankfurt the night of 4 February

and remained in a safehouse there until ll February, when press

the defection and Soviet demands for an

ate interview with NOSENKO prompted the Director of Central In

telligence to order that he be brought to washington as soon as

possible. He arrived in the evening of 12 February.

Soviet Official Reactions

Later events showing soviet orticial reactions to NOSENKO & de-

fection are presented below in chronological order:

8 February: A Soviet spokesman in Geneva reported to

Swiss police that NOSENKO,

an "expert" temporarily assigned to

Geneva, had been missing for four days.

9 February: Evening news broidcasts in Geneva carried

reports attributed to both Soviet and Swiss sources that NOSENKO

had disappeared.

10 February: Unidentified. Soviet sources were quoted in

the press as having said it was presumed that he had defected.

A U. S. Department of State press release was issued iden-

tifying NOSENKO as a KGB officer

and'acknowledging his request

for political asylum in the United States.

11 February: The Department of State was advised informally

by Amoassador DOBRYNIN in Washington that a Soviet note to be

delivered later would ask how NOSENKO had left Switzerland,

request his release, and demand an immediate interview with him.

12 February: S. K. TSARAPKIN, the head of the Soviet Dele-

gation to the Disarmament Conference, read a statement at a press

conference in which he

strongly condemned the Swiss authorities

for permitting NOSENKO'S

"kidnapping"

and for hindering efforts

to locate him.

TSARAPKIN demanded that immediate steps

be taken

to return NOSENKO to Soviet custody.

At simultaneous press conferences in Bern and Geneva, the

Swiss rejected these accusations of non-cooperation and noted

the Soviet delay in advising the police of NOSENKO's disappear-

ance and Soviet failure to cooperate with Swiss authorities in

locating NOSENKO.

The Soviet note predicted by DOBRYNIN was delivered to

the State Department, and a noncommittal reply was given to

Apparently no effort was made to notify Moscow immediately.

NOSENKO told both the Swiss and the Soviets that he had defected

of his own free will after careful consideration and that hu

KORNIENKO's questions, he specifically renounced his status and

12, a mother and a younger brother.

Ao

Introduction

The biography of NOSENKO is built largely upon his oratate-

ments

to CIA, but certain portions of it have been substantiated

(as well as contradicted) by other Soviet sources. Given first

below is the NOSENKO autobiogiaphy for the period preceeding his

entry into the kob, then follows a surmary of his statements

about his non-professional life since becoming a KGB officer, and

(finally there is presented a review of what other sources have

said on these subjects.. A separate section of this paper, Part Vo

discusses NOSENKO's career in the KGB.

B.

NOSENKO'8 PrE-KGB Autobiography

Although several other sources have since NOSENKO's defec

tion furnished fragmentary information concerning NOSENKO's early.

personal history, NOSENKO himself has, of course, been the prin-

cipal source on this topic.

He volunteered information during

the 1962 meetings, during

debriefings in early 1964, and under

interrogation in April 1964, in 1965, and in 1956.

These vari-

ous accounts are arranged in separate coiumns in the following

table, and

they are organized chronologically from NOSENKO'S

birth to his alleged entry into the KCB.

The first column in

the table contains statenents which NOSENKO made during the June

1962 meetings in Geneva; these were taken from the transcripts

of the meetings and, for the most part, are in NOSENKO's own

words.

The column headed "1964," derived from the April 1964

interrogation, reflects a number of changes in his story before

and during that interrogation.

Most of the information given

in the "1965" column was taken from discussions with NOSENKO,

mainly on his early years,

material

by a CIA psychologist in May of that

from

the February 1965 interrogation

and from DERYABIN's interrogation in July and August has also

been

included when it was not covered in the psychologist's ques-

tioning and when NOSENKO signed protocols certifying his state-

ments to be correct.

The

"April 1966" column is comprised of

remarks by NOSENKO in a signed autobiography submitted to CIA

at that time.

The final column presents

the results of the

October 1966

interrogation as they pertain to NOSENKO's early

life.

From column to column appear inconsistencies and contra

dictions with

regard to dates and locations furnished by NOSENKO,

although in 1964, again in 1965, and most recently in October

1966 NOSENKO has said that he was "now" telling the truth.

The

table shows where he has admitted having previously lied about

certain events and where he seems to have forgotten his earlier

statements to CIA about the occurrence of other events affecting

his life.

This tabulation of NOSENKO's autobiography concludes in

Part V.A., in which are quoted the various dates and circum

stances

concerning his entry into the KGB which NOSENKO has

given in 1962, 1964, 1965, and 1966.

C. Personal Affairs Since Entering the KGB

1. Family Life

The Soviet internal passport which NOSENKO carried to

Geneva in 1964 confirms his claim that he married Lyudmila

KOZHEVNIKOVA on 27 June 1953.

(They married approximately

six months

after he says he first met her at a sanatorium or

"rest home" outside Moscow and about three months after he

says he joined the KGB.)

Immediately after their marriage

the couple moved

into the home of NOSENKO's new

in-laws

at

Ulitsa Serafimovich 2, Moscow, where they lived until obtain-

ing their own apartment on Narodnaya Ulitsa in January 1955.*

KOZHEVNIKOVA's father is Yulian Mikolayevich KOZHEVNIKOV,. a

metallurgical engineer by training, who held the position

of

First Deputy Chairman of the State Scientific Research Com

(GKKNIR) of the RSFSR at the time of NOSENKO's defec-

NOSENKO said that he has two daughters by this second

marriage.

According to his passport, the eldest of these,

Oksana, was born on 21 August 1354' and the other, Tamara,

on

13 July 1958.***

NOSEUKO in 1952 displared to his CIA handlers

a photograph of the two girls and their mother and made a par-

ticular point of noting the close physical resemblance between

On 23 April 1964 NOSENKO was questioned on the various

apartments he occupied in Moscow.

He siid that, from the

time of his marr: age to

TELEGINA until his departure for

his first GRU post in the Far East, he lived in an apart-

ment on Meshchanskaya Ulitsa. He gave up this apartment,

he said, in 1950, when, his Navy orders came through.

Having made this

statement, NOSENKO was then asked why

the 1951 Moscow telcphone directory still listed him at

the Meshchanskaya Ulitsa address. He replied that he could

not explain but that he was considered to have vacated the

house in 1950.

(He later said he moved to the Far East in

1951 - see Section IV.B. ) NOSENKO ther said that the

previous tenant at Narodnaya Ulitsa 13 had been one Nikita

ISHCHENKO.

Although the phone then in the apartment was

switched to NOSENKO's name for billing purposes, NOSENKO

never bothered to have

the change entered in the Moscow

phone book; he said that this would have required a visit

to a downtown office, the filling out of numerous forms,

etc.; besides he added, he did not use the telephone any-

way.

Therefore, NOSENKO said, from 1955 until his defec-

tion in 1964, the telephone in his apartment was listed

under the name of ISHCHENKO.

He has repeated this story

during subsequent questionings.

The 1961 Moscow phone

directory carries no listing for NOSENKO;

it does list

ISHCHENKO but gives his address as Krasnokholmskaya

Naberezhnaya, not Narodnaya Ulitsa.

• The GKKNIR of the RSFSR is now the GNTK. PENKOVSKIY worked

***

NOSENKO has also given his second daughter's year of birth

as 1957.

In 1962 he told CIA that the older daughter was

then studying in the first class at school; in 1965, how

ever, he said she began school in the fall of 1962.

His wife, in a letter after the

Venereal Disease

The incident which NOSENKO has most often cited as

an

example of his irresponsibility in the period prior to 1956

involved his illegal use of KGB alias documents to cover treat-

ment for a case of goncirhea he contracted in 1954, at the time

his wife was pregnant with their first child.

The CIA psycho-

logist who questioned NOSENKO in May 1966 submitted the follow-

ing summary of NOSENKO's statements about this ircident, which

are

about as given earlier (during the April 1964 interroga-

a note for him to report.

However, he did not go to the safe-

house so knew nothing of the note.

In the false passport was

a listing of where the named person worked, a fictitious

factory.

As the result of the clinic inquiries, the request

for information got into the hands of the section which made

the docurents.

NOSENKO was called before the deputy chief of

the Directorate and severely criticized.

He explained what

had happened and was given five days of

house arrest.

However.

the chief of his section had also gotten word of the

infraction

and sentenced him to fifteen days of house arrest without even

talking to him.

He told his wife he was going on a trip and

moved into the administrative room near the office to serve

his term®

Committee called NOSENKO's father on the phone and told him

the whole story.

NOSENKO's father never toli either NOSENKO' g

wife or mother of the incident, but did chide NOSENKO about

it..

The incident was brought before the Kursomo, and alscussed.

A written reprimand

for immoral conduct-unauthorized use of

official documents was placed in his record.

This was also

a final warning meanirg

that any other infraction would result

in expulsion.

He made the statement that he had been punished

for this incident many times.

He could not immediately apply

for party membership; the incident was brought up repeatedly

in Konsomol meetings

and even in party meetings (after he was

accepted) as a horrible example; and it kept him from being

promoted from Senior Lieutenant to Captain.

(The Deputy-

Director who

gave him five days was a member of the promotion

commission.)"

Although there have been slight changes and contradictions

in NOSENKO's numerous accounts of this story (the house arrest

was variously reported as 5, 10, and 15 days) it remained

basically consistent until the October 1966 interrogations

when he said for the first time that he contracted gonorrhea

from the girl in Leningrad in 1945 rather thar. 1954.

In 1954,

he said, he again was infected, this time by a prostitute whom

he picked up in the vicinity of the Leningrad Railroad Station

in Moscow.

When the KGB required that he reveal the source.

NOSENKO said, he ascribed the latter case to the origiral girl

from Leningrad.

During the October 1966 interrogations NOSENKO

also told CIA for the first time that he had had venereal

disease

on two other occasions while studying at the Institute

of International Arfairs.

He later began to "feel more a part of the KGB," and as

a junior KGB case officer.

out by the newly-created Tourist Departmert of the Second Chief

"And in 1956," NOSENKO said ir. 1964, "cefore

my father's death, I was made a candidate for membership in

the Communist Party and, exactly 15 days later, was assigned

the rank of Senior Case Officer.

forth."

3, Affiliation with Communist Party Organs

NOSENKO said that his formal participation in Communist

Party activities began in late 1943 or early 1944 when he

joined the Komsomol at the Naval Preparatory School in Baku.

This step was a casual one, and he has said that he took it

without much thought, mainly because all his friends were

See Part V.D.4.b. for a description of the BURGI recruit-

ment operation.

Until 1966 NOSENKO claimed to CIA that

he had received an award for his participation in this

operation.

In the October 1966 interrogations he retracted

this and said that he never received any KGB award for the

BURGI or any other operation.

joining..

When NOSENKO entered the KGB in the spring of 1953,

he transferred routinely to the Komsomol organization there

and became

Secretary of the Konsomol Organization of the

Second Chief Directorate.

This was a small organization

consisting, NOSENKO thought, of about 17 KGD employees; he

remained its secretary until June or July 1954,

when he got

into the trouble over illegal use of operational documents.

According to NOSENKO.

"Inmediately after this incident the

Bureau of the Komsomol was gathered, and I was immediately

removed from the position of Secretary." A week later, a

"strict reprimand" was entered in NOSENKO's Konsomol records.

In October 1954, on the eve of his 27th birthday, NOSENKO

waS

forced out of the Komsomol for over-age.*

At that time,

the "strict reprimand" he had received several months earlier

was remitted on NOSENKO's petition, and he was permitted to

leave the organization with a clean record.

He was not per-

mitted to join the Communist Party immediately, however.

NOSENKO described the situation on 15 April 1964 as follows:

"Now I had to prove myself.

Not being a candidate for Party

membership. I asked them for assignments to show my eagerness,

to prove myself. I also asked the Party Organization of the

Second Chief Directorate for some 'public service' (obshchest-

venniy assignments.

I collected newspapers."

For a year,

NOSENKO

"made good" by running errands and performing other

such tasks, until it was decided that he wes

suitable for

Party membership.

He applied in January 1956 and

was accepted

as a candidate member of the Party in June the same year:

full membership was granted in 1957.

For over a year, from

October 1954 until January 1956, NOSENKO said, he had

the

distinction of being the only employee of the KGB who was

neither a Komsomol nor a Party member or applicant.

Statements to Others by NOSENKO

Before giving CIA the foregoing details, NOSENKO had

talked about himself to several non-Soviets, including persons

involved in cases which are reviewed in other portions of this

paper.

NOSENKO informed the recruitment target Horst BRAUNS

that he had two daughters.** He advised Ivan Ivanovich PREIS-

FREUND, a Finnish citizen

used in the recruitment approach to

a U.S. Army sergeant in Moscow, that he was married, his

father was dead

but his mother was living, he had served in

the Navy, and he had two children.

PREISFREUND met the

"little girls" ard later reported to CIA that, although

" NOSENKO was a "woman-chaser," he loved his daughters very

much. *** With one KGB agent

in particular,

Arsene FRIPPEL,

NOSENKO was especially forthcoming: he told FRIPPEL of his

According to the Statutes (Ustav) of the Komsomol in effect

in 1954, the maximum age for a Komsomol member at that time

was 25.

On this basis, NOSENKO should have been excluded

in October 1953, upon reaching his 26th birthday.

When

this was explained to NOSENKO by DERYABIN in July 1965,

NOSENKO replied that he was certain he left the Komsomol

in 1954 upon reaching the age of 27, that he was sure the

masimum age was 26 at that time,

and that no special

exceptions were made in his case.

D. Soviets' Statements About NOSENKO
