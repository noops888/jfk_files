The report of SA MAURICE F. FARABEE, dated

March 28, 1961, at Miami, in the case entitled "Changed,

GUILLERMO FEDERICO COLOMA Y ENRIGUEZ, aka, IS - Cuba,

RA - Cuba," reflects that DOMINICIS was interviewed by

the Miami Office on February 15, 1961, concerning

FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO, aka,

"El Mexicano," the

subject of Bufile 105-78976, Miami file 105-1891, and

concerning COLOMA.

On the basis of the information reflected

in instant report, no additional information is deemed

warranted by the Miami Office. DOMINICIS is believed to

possess insufficient potential to warrant his development

as a PSI; therefore, this case is being closed by the

Miami Office.
