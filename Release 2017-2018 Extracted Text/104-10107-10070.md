MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

1. On 25 March 1969, a meeting took place in Mr. Warner's

office attended by Messrs. Milligan and Heinonen of CCS/LPGLOBE,

MI.

Jack Geaslin, Chief, European Division/France,,

and the undersigned, to discuse the ramifications ozl

Mr. Warner

assignment to Paris.

2.

Mr. Warner began

the

meeting by giving Mr. Geaslin a

chronology covering (a)L

relationship with Itkin, (b) Itkin's

relationship with CIA, (c) Itkin's

relationship with the FBI, (d) Itkin's

indictment in the New York State court, (e) Itkin's potential use as

a witness for the prosecution in the federal court against organized

criminals, and (f) the Itkin involvement with F. Lee Bailey and the

possible publicity attendant thereto.

3. It was then explained that following a meeting with Messrs.

Hogan, Morgenthau, Kossack and Houston, it was agreed that Itkin

would plead guilty to two misdemeanors in the New York State court

and receive a suspended sentence.

In return, the State of New York

would withdraw its motion to remand Itkin for trial currently pending

in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New

York. These maneuvers would result in Itkin's being available for

use as a Government witness in future cases and his credibility not

being subject to attack by the future defendants based on his New

York State trial. Mr. Warner further explained that this latest

development would a can to a pe takey exp heat of and, removed

affiliation

It was further explained that there had been indications that

Morgenthau's office and the FBI were attempting to inflate Itkin's

past affiliations with CIA in an attempt to demonstrate his dedication

and to remove the aspect of criminal intent. It had also been

assumed that, if Itkin were to be tried in the state court, F. Lee

Bailey would not hesitate to use any available methods to embarrass

the United States Government in such a way as to influence the

decision of the jury and also generate public interest to assist in

the future sales of Itkin's book.

Mr. Warner then explained the elements of concern which

required the debriefing of

in Frankfurt in mid-February,

resulting in the conclusion thatl

was leveling with his Agency

contacts on his relationships with Itkin.

]stated categorically

that he had never discussed his association with CIA with Itkin and,

knowledge, Itkin was not aware of |

_CIA employ-

ment.

Further discussion evolved around people who are knowl-

edgeable of

relationship to CIA. These include (a) members

of the U.S. Attorney's office, (b) members of the New York County

District Attorney's office, (c) the New York FBI, office, and (d) we

must assume that Itkin himself is aware of

CIA affiliation.

It was concluded that although the number of knowledgeable persons

appears large, the circumstances as they exist today, i.e., that

Itkin will not be brought to trial in the New York State court, seem

to have removed any forum or need for divulging this information

by any of the above.

The residual problem of Barnard Collier's

publishing his long feature article on Itkin was raised, and there

is no way of estimating whether Collier is aware of

affiliation.

5. Mr. Geaslin asked the question of whether we felt there

was any subversive connection with any of the people related to the

case which could report on

PCIA affiliation to Communist

Party elements in

It was concluded that on that particular

question Mr. Rocca of the

CI Staff would be in the best position to

evaluate that aspect, and his counsel should be sought on that matter.

6. Mi. Milligan raised the question as to the type of cover

to be used byL

Jon his

assignment, and it was agreed

between him and Mr. Geaslin that the suitability of cover had to be

reassessed at this time.

7.

Mr. Warner suggested that the participation of OGC in

this case as it relates to

appears to be concluded, although

it was suggested that Mr. Geaslin maintain a tickler to recontact

OGC at least every six months to ascertain whether the New York

problems were still in a status quo or were in fact heating up again.

It was agreed that OGC would attempt to determine if in fact the

suggested

steps of Itkin's guilty plea and the removal of the State

motion to remand had taken place.
