COOPER (DL 162-208). (The above actions by COX appeared to

verify information

previously received from DL-95-C that COX,

as LITTLE's runner, had connections at various private clubs

in Dallas where bets were placed during the week and which

were being laid off to LITTLE through COX). Subsequently COX

went to a drive-in at 1222 South Industrial where he drank

beer and where it appeared he picked up a young girl who was

driving a 1962 Chevrolet, Arkansas license 9-15281. This

girl was accompanied by

another girl and when the woman who

was driving this car got into. COX's car, the passenger then

drove off in the Chevrolet.

This car is registered to W. V.

forty days and had no information as to his, whereabouts. She

stated that her husband quite frequently "takes off" on drinking

sprees and would be gone for long periods of time.

activities at the Redmen Club but did state her husband was

a former officer in the Redmen Assoclation, whose business it

was to establish such clubs throughout Texas and New Mexico.
