Remycab January 28, 1964.

On February 4, 1964, Inspector L. R. Parent,

Directorate of security and Intelligence, RCMP Headquarters,

said no additional information had been developed to date

re OSBORNE.

He said it is his understanding the Canadian

Consul in New Orleans could furnish very 'little information

and Canadian External Affairs has wired Its office in Mexico

in an effort to obtain additional information. He also

said inquiries are being made through British sources in

view of his claimed prior residence in England and investi-

gation is being conducted to establish circumstances

surrounding his admission to Canada and in Alberta in view

of information in letter written by OSBORNE to the YMCA

in Montreal, Quebec. (C)

The Bureau will be advised of additional

information as received.
