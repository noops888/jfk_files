RE: Your AS 753 of 14-2-151; further to our

22(CA7)/52/589 of 11-6-152.

SUBJECT:

nvestigation into the KRIVITSKY case

he Firm of GADA; "HANS" ana "THEODOR MAIY'

Te are at present reexamining the KRIVIISKY case and are

making again inquiries about the firm of GADA)of Insteriam men-

tioned in your a.n. letter.

Fenuing the rosults of those inquiries we herewith pass you the

folloving information additional to that sent to you by our

22(017/52/589 of 11-6-'52, that you may the sooner be able to form

an accurate Idea of the case.

I In april 1951 your s

- acarding

representative receivea from the

to information received by us from them - a

report on the statements the Dutch subject Henri Christian PIECK,

born 19-4-1895 Den Helder, made coucerning his activities for the

RIS.

In this report occur the nanes of "iANS", alias "HARRY", and

"PLIEd", alias "Theodor WALI", alias Paul HARDT, while two dra-

wings were attached to the report,

which PIECK had nade of

"LOD:IG" - Ignace RiISS, and üf "INS".

In the book "This Deception" (published by DUELL, SLOAN &

PEARC. - New York) the authoress Hede MASSING tells, that in the

first half of the thirties she was in contact with Ignace ReISS,

SORGE, KRIVITSKY, Paul HARDI, and

"FELIK". In the beginning of

the vth Chapter (p. 68) the authoress gives a description of Ri-

chary SOrGe, saying among other hings: "His cold blue eyes,:

slightly slanted and heavy browed, had retained their quality of

Looking amused for no reason at all"

It seems à peculiar coinciuence,

That PIscK in describing "HANS"

says: "always

„apreared to be smiling", and "was slightly Asiatic

in'appearance". Though in some further points the two descriptions

do not quite tally, there is a possibility that "HANS" and SORGE r

are

identical, and

that for this reason that SORGe was in the forme

hall o1 1955 aprointed correspondent for Japan by the "Algemeen

Handelsblaa" of Amsterdam, and. "HATS" had reporteuly been commis-

sioned to go to Jupan (though according to PICK he had not obeyed

the instruction). No doubt Hede NASSING made much more detailed

statements to the F.B.I. on her activities for the RIS than those

laid down in her book; she nust also have given descriptions of

the persons with whom she was in contact.

PISCK gave physical descriptions of his employers in the rIs. It

is recommendable to examine whether the two descrintions of Paul

iT taliy, and whether dede l scild may be able with the help

Of PIECK'S

ürawing of "his" anü the description to ivertily the

later. It would be advisadle also to show to rede

mir=s of ignace reiss to be able to check whether aftes i tigue

1 - years II.CK baß been able to draw a good likeness of his

lornes employers, and has done so with great fidelity.

#e should particularly be graceful for the invustigation of

the KRIVIISKY case to possess copies of the statenents ileue

MasSING mace concerning her contacts with the is, and of KRIVIIN-

Iy's stutements regurding his contacts, targets, and other useful

information.
