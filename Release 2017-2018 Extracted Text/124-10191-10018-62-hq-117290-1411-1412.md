Doer Mr, Chaizman:

As you may recall on November 18, 1973, I voluntarily

appeared to cestify batore the louse Select Commattee on

Asoadsinations concerning certain remarks that 1 allegedly mode

to former Special Agent Arthur Hurtaugh

that I had admitted

I wish to bring to

your atconcion thac ar no tice during my testimony did 1 evor moks

any statement concerning recial projudzee toward Dr. ling.

have carefully reviewed my testimony and at no time did the matter:

of race ever arise.

"personal

prejudice" toward De. King was based on my conviction that his

reported association with the Conmunist Party was the basis for

his being a threat to national security.

As it was the purpose of the House Select Conmittee on

Assassinations to seek the truth regarding the King

assassination,

I feel it is incumbent that this matter be clarified.

I completely refute your statement that I was racially

prejudiced, as racial bigotry is personally repugnant to me.

For these lessons

I respectfully request that a copy of this

communication be included as an addendum to the House Select

Committee on

Assassinations

report.

Respectfully,

3\18\86
