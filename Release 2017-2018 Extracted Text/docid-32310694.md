Legat, Havana (137-18)

SUBJECT:

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT HAV-29

Captioned criminal informant, who was formerly SU 351-C,

has been residing at Calle 7

$230, Vista Hermosa, Camaguey, Cuba.

Discreet inquiry on February 27, 1958, established that this

informant has left Camaguey and apparently has returned to the

United States.

Indications are that he does not intend to return

to Cuba.

The exact reason for his departure is not known; however,

it is known that he was associated with NORMANKROTHMAN, FBI #12585B,

and some of ROTHMAN's business ventures in Camaguey have been

unsuccessful. In addition, there have been increased revolutionary

activities in the central and eastern part of Cuba and informant

may have felt insecure residing in Camaguey.

The Salt Lake City office is requested to discreetly

contact reliable sources in las Vegas to ascertain if the informant

has returned there and advise the Legat, Havana.

Two extra copies

of this letter have been prepared for forwarding to the Salt Lake

City office (137-356).
