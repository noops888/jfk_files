this memorandum have furnished reliable

information in the past.

on March 30, 1971, a fist confidential source

furnished literature, concerning the Women's Bail Fund, which

was picked up at the

Upper westside Womens Center, 627

The literature captioned,

Amsterdam Avenue, New YOr "women's Bail Fund" argued

New York (NY) on March 27, 1971.

Women's House of Detention, in New York City (NYC), should

not exist and that "the women's House of Detention, along with the

prisons and jails across the country, is a weapon used by the

power structure here

of poor communities. „In America to oppress and exploit the people

It further relates that "Women have come

together in New York from many different organizations to form a

Women's

Bail Fund for all the sisters inside the House of

Deention. The Bail

Fund is also working to prepare simple

pamphlets on law because of the total lack of any legal

resources in

the House of Detention and secure legal assistance

where needed." The address is listed as the Women's Bail Fund,

the "sisters from their supporters."

By means of a loudspeaker, the demonstrators called to

Women's Bail Fund

A first confidential source advised that Beverly Sterner,

Channel 13 News

304 West 58th Street, New York, New York,!

is affiliated with the Women's Bail Fund (WBF).

An article appeared in the March, 1972 issue of

the "Liberated Guardian",

captioned "Women's Bail Fund;

Organizing Our Anger"

, written by five unidentified members

of the Women's Bail Fund Collective.

The article relates "The Women's Bail Fund is a

group of about 35 women in New York City that bails women

out of jail (150 so far).

They have been organized for over

a year and a half and did their first bailout on December 20,

1970.

They have been active in supporting other groups

involved in the prison struggle.

They do legal follow-up

for bailed-out sisters who want

it and have been talking

with people about the prison struggle, why jails exist, who

the real enemies are, étcetera."

The article is introduced by the following

statement:

"For this article we wanted to talk about ourselves.

So five of us volunteered to collect different thoughts from

as many women as possible in our group and then pooled these

reflections in this article, using the words from their raps."

The article, being reflections of the various

members of the group,

is a

series of quotes by unidentified

members concerning the WBF.

Women's Bail Fund

The following are reflections of some WBF

members carried under the subcaption "Our Roots - Why

We Started - Why We Joined"

"There was a woman in my consciousness-raising

group who was in the bail fund when it was first sere ne

started and she talked with others about it.

To others it was

frightening - connecting to political activity as women.

Ultimately it ended in a split of my small group on

whether we should carry our newly raised consciousness

to any sort of feminist political action or not.

"In the past, I was politically frustrated because

I was only involved in one-shot actions.

I saw what was

happening in terms of how this system functions to oppress

black people and that resulted inalot of pain for me.

felt I had to reflect my stands in a day-to-day struggle.

I had the sense that the women in the WBF were also aware

of that need.

"When sisters want us to, we go to court with them.

When I go to court I find that it can do bad things to my

head.

I make judgements like this jude is better than another

but it's all shit.

judges are pigs.

Or like

one ling good that a sister got six months instead of five

years when she shouldn't have gotten anything at all.

"I was in the House of Detention when there was the

bail fund demonstration on December 20, 1970.

The whole

tier was so excited. When someone saw the first people she

let out a scream and everyone rushed to the windows.

the chanting increased outside we started to sing and chant.

They locked us in our cells so each person would be isolated

and intimidated about chanting.

But all the women kept it

Everyone inside said the feeling about this demonstration

was different than other demonstrations.

There had been more

contact. The women saw Afeni and Joan and another woman

that they had known inside outside in the demonstration.

That was real important.

"A lot of it was the bail fund. The bail fund

banner with the address made it real that people were serious

about supporting people inside. It wasn't

• going to be a

one-shot deal.

So much of what we do is short-term support

stuff that can be seen as reformist.

these demands it'

s understood to be revolutionamers raise

people on the outside raise them, they are felt to be

reformist.

I have done a whole lot of courtroom work,

both in the bail fund and before too. In fact, the whole

social work thing is what I come out of,

which

is why it

is so hard for me to deal with all this

('cause I obviously

reflect a lot of that

work). Social work when it started

back in the late 1800's and

early 1900's came out of real

radical circles, the radicals and feminists and such..

when you read MAO, he talks about service to the people

as a revolutionary thing.

But for us it feels weirc

because it has been co-opted.

I think that the movement

noW,

trying to recoup the revolutionary aspects, that

original sense of service to the people, trying

; to help

people survive.

"One of the ways to really keep ourselves

out of the rut of being social workers is to engage in

nore political education among ourselves and to

not of sente o

ask other

groups how they've dealt with this question. Also we

should be more involved in educating other people.

"We should be doing more for women inside. We

need to really work on facilitating communications

between the sisters inside the jail. Women prisoners

have been slower to get organized but I'm sure this is

because there is so much isolation in the women's jail.

Concretely, we need to write more letters

to find out what

is going on, send literature, but also tell the women about

each other, about what other women are thinking and feeling.

This would stop the sense of isolation and increase the

sense of solidarity.

"I think much of the movement is guilty of

ultra-leftism. In China the Communists worked on a lot

of things that were a lot less than what they ultimately

wanted.

We're too afraid of being contaminated by being

involved in reform movements.

We too often define our

enemies too broadly and our

allies too narrowly.

"I've been real impressed with what women in the

group are willing to commit themselves to do and that they

fulfill those commitments. And that atmosphere of res-

ponsibility affects new members too. This is real

important.

It helps me through the rough times and all

the ideological hassles and

struggles we go through.

You really have a sense that everyone really wants to work

things through, search for solutions, wants to hold

together because we feel responsible for the work. Even

the way people ask for leaves of absence when they are

sick or too busy, that they feel they want to explain

why they have to

ay poo busy, stop do

stop doing work for a while, shows

people'

Re: Vincent Hallinan

Vincent Hallinan was candidate for President

oi the United States on the Independent Progressive Party

ticket in 1952.

This party was formed in California in 1948

and ceased to exist in 1954, when it failed to poll sufficient

votes to remain on a California ballot.

The California

Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in

its 1955 report on page forty-six, states in part that the

Independent Progressive Party in California was quickly

captured by the communists and

soon was being operated lock,

stock and'barrel by the Communist Party of California.

A source advised on April 20, 1966, that Vincent

Hallinan was the Treasuren for American Institue For Marxist

Studies (AIMS).

A characterization of AIMS

is contained in the appendix.

According to the source, it is the aim and

objective of Vivian Hallinan when she goes to Washington,

D.C., in conjunction with the kankin brigade to get herself

arrested

as she believes that nothing can be accomplished

unless the women are arrested and then do their talking

from jail.

YOU CANNOT HAVE

WARS WITHOUT

WOMEN

Women must use their minds, their voices, and

their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do

less is to ignore our special responsibilities to

the human race.

"10, 000 women have sat back and let their sons

be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10, 000 women

willing to go to jail if necessary we could stop

the war in Vietnam. You cannot have wars with-

out women."

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

May of this year. Fifty years ago, as the first

woman elected to Congress, she voted against

World War I. She has consistently maintained

her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura-

geous and vigorous as ever--an inspiration to all

women.

The presence of the United States forces in the int

•ernal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and illegal.

There can be no possible justification for our inte

ference in the domestic affairs of this tiny distant

land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she is wil

ing to stay in jail until the bombing is stopped. N

all women are free to join her, but we can assure

'her that thousands of women will march peacefull

beside her. Some will picket, others will go to ja

with Miss Rankin. Every woman's participation i

equally valuable. We are confident each one will

the maximum of which she is capable.

On January 8th, women from all over the land wil

BRIGADE FORMED TO CONFRONT CONGRESS

кай втором

Helena, Montana

November 27, 1967

To all American Women:

I am proud of the fact that my first

vote cast in Congress was a vote

against war. It was the first oppor-

unity for a woman to vote, because I

was the first woman to be

elected to

Congress.

I believed then, as I do today,

that women are the

ones that must be

concerned with the needs and develop-

ment of the human race.

I have always

fought for the dignity of all human

beings - for those of the present as

well as those of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long

as I live.

I hope all women will res-

pond to the following call and join me

in Washington on January 8, 1968, the

opening day of Congress.

Jeannette Rankin

A CALL TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN WhO

are

of human needs at home To COrE TO

WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 8

AMERICAN WOMEN represent 51% of the

voting population of our country.

AMERICAN WOMEN have the power to a-

chieve peace and a decent life for

every American.

This is woman power!

Demonstrate it to the Congress of the

United States! Come to Washington on

January 8 as Congress opens in joint

session.

Support Jeannette Rankin

as

she leads a represchtative delegation

of American women to the Capitol to

demand that:

*Congress, as its first order

of business, resolve to end

the war in Vietnam and innedi-

ately arrange for the with-

drawal of all American troops.

*Congress use its power to make

reparations for the ravaged land

we leave behind in Vietnam.

*Congress listen to what the

American people are saying and

refuse the insatiable demands of

the military-industrial complex.

WOMEN OF AMERICA, our power is un-

limited. On January 8, American women

will:

*PETITION the United States Con-

gress

*CONVENE a Congress of Anerican

Women that afternoon to develop

programs to meet the crisis in

America - programs which will

express our political power,

reason and conscience.

For further information about the

Brigade, contact your nearest WSP

group or write to the Jeannette Rankir

Mary Clarke and Eva Korn, both of who are active in wSP.

Mary Clarke is currently a member of the JPE's National Steer-

Eva Korn was a member of the Los Angeles County

To give publicity to the proposed activity of the

JRB, the local WSP office is circulating a reprint from the

Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who

volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that

they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail

for the commission of civil disobedience while in Washington,

D. C.

Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit

women to join the Brigade would be, to make a pitch for

recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagnar Wilson and Ruth/krause

are making their respective speaking engagements across the

United States since their return from a trip to Noith Vietnam,

which they visited as representatives of WSP during the

fall of 1967.

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965

that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,

Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967

"peace conference" in Helsinki, Finland, at the

Invitation of the Communist Party (CP),

and that

funds to cover her expenses were raised in part

by the CP; and that following her attendance at

the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten

days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet

Government.

Source One learned that a communication was re-

ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,

Indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not

be

held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until

either the 15th or 22nd of January 1958, depending upon

the date that the United States Congress would reconvene.

The communication indicated that since the entire purpose

of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session

of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march

prior to the date Congress would reconvene. The suggestion

was made that recruitment of local women to participate in

the uRB be held in abeyance until a confirmation had been

obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.

Source One, had Indicated that although the "Call"

as reproduced in "La Wiso"

, states,

"There will be local

actions across the country

at the same time as the action

ference of members of the Communist Party, USA

(CrUSA), including

national functionaries, met in Chicago: Illinois, Ins the purpose

of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national

centers and to solidify the Party base through the DCA..

This

scurce also advised in Sepierber, 1966 that DANTAL RUBIN, CPUSA

National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes

the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organiz-

ation favorable to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism,

and In April, 1961, aavised Gus HalL, CPUSA General Secretary,

indicated

the dcA primary emphasis should be on developing

mass resistance to the draft.

A third source advised in September, 1967, that JARVIS

ITNER was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at

the Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New

York, from September 8-10, 1967.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations,

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

Delaware (CPEPD), was held November 13, 1958 at 3425 Powelton Avenue, Phila-

delphia. At this meeting, DANIEL RUBIN, the District Education Director,

presented a proposal for a series of forums under the nominal sponsorship of

the Philadelphia Social Science Forum Committee (PSSFC). The source stated

that PSSFC was merely a paper organization and this series of forums was

organized by the District Education Cormission and had to be approved by the

District Comnittee (CPEPD) before being put into effect.

This source stated on june 12, 1959, November 5, 1959, and October 21,

1960 that the PSSFC remained under the control of the District Education

Connission, CPEPD.

A second source reported on October 9, 1961, that the District Execu-

tive Comnittee (DEC), CPEPD, met on October 2, 1961, and approved plans to hold

and to support a new series of forums of PSSFC beginning November 10, 1961, and

Fifty years ago, as the first

The presence of the United States forces in

the internal struggle of Vietnam is immoral and

11legal.

There can be no possible justification

for out interference in the domestic affairs of

this tiny distant land.

This 86-year-old woman has stated that she

Not ald women are ree to join her, but

we can assure her that thousanas of women will

Every woman's participation is equally valuable.

Dear Friend:

We are sending this letter to you and others from whom we have not heard much

recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace

movement.

It has been too long since we last neard directly from many of you,

and our meetings with those of you whom wi have seen recently have been brief.

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,

as ie learn of the mounting horrors in Viotnam. But this feeling is only

temporary, and quickly gives way to activity.

As women, we bear the major

responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement,

Inclosed you will find an announcenent of the latest national women's effort

for peace.

Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds

to send representatives to hashington. We hope that you will also support this

effort, to insure representaticn from Portland Women for Peace. The coupon

on the

enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.

In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration

in Portland

at

NOON, Monday, JANUARY 15th

(or dark colored) umbrella.

We shall carry the umbrellas opened,

rain or shine.

Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),

expressing support for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, will be

available. We shall march around the Post Office block for one houx,

from noon to 1 pomn., leafleting as we walk.

He hope, It you cannot go to washington, yourselt, that you will contribute to

help someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the floneer

Post Office at noon Monday, January 15th.

In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might

do locally.

We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on

rinich. we shall need much help.

Please get in touch with one of us soon. Your help, ideas, and efforts are

urgently needed.

Yours for Peace,

CONFIDENTAE

• November 27, 1967:

I am proud.of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress was a vote against war.

It was the first opportunity for a woman to vote, because I, was the first, woman

to be elected to Congress.

I believed then, as I do today, that women aru the ones that must be concerned

with the

needs, and. development of the human race. I have always lougnt for the

dignity of all human beings - for those of the prosent as well as those of future

generations

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to

the following. call and join me in Washington on

January 05, 1268, the opening day

of Congress.

the women

to stay with other WSP members in the

Washington, D..C. area. Source one advised that it is

contemplated all the women will stay in Washington, D.C. until

Tuesday, January 16, 1967.

at 11:30 A.M. on January 15, 1968. Source one further reported

it is hoped ten thousand women will participate in the

demonstration. After the gathering at Union Depot, the women

will march in

solemn procession, all wearing black, to the

steps of the capitol building where the petition containing

the redress of grievances will be presented to the Congress.

Source one further advised it had been reported that Representative

Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield had agreed to receive the

Representative Mc Cormick, according to source one,

had agreed to accept fifteen women in his office at which time

he would receive the petition, but source one advised the

JRB now wants Representative Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield

to accept the petition on the steps of the capitol building

in order that they might get news coverage. After the petition

has been presented, the JRB wants the redress of grievances

read into the Congressional Record.

Further activities

of the JRB while in Washington, D.C.

are to include a three hour

"Women's Congress"

, possibly on

the

grounds of Georgetown University.

Mary Clarke pointed out that although the original

intention had been to have only those women participate

in the JRB who were willing to risk arrest for civil disobedience,

she stated at the above meeting that no civil disobedience is

anticipated in view of the large number of organizations

participating who are opposed to

such civil disobedience.

However, she further stated that individuals are not going to

be discouraged who might elect to create civil disobedience.

FIRST UNEMARTAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

A source advised on May 22, 1967, that the

premises of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936

West Sth Street, Los Angeles, California, have been utilized

for meetings by Communist Party members and sympathizers over

a period of years. Speakers and lecturers at. the church

frequently espouse Communist causes or follow the Communist

Party line.

Communist front group literature is distributed

at the church. The church is used by some Communist farty

members for

"mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of

the church such as the Unitarian Public Forum anâ the Fellow-

ship for social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-

Universalist Fellowship

for Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the

church since 1948.

Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in

the Fourtn Report, Un-American Activities Committee in

active "Communist

fronter"

California, 1948, page 115, as a ver communist front organi-

and connected

with numerous

zations and activities."

Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not,

of itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist

Party.

advised on January 3, 1968, that a delegation fron

the JRB and their attorney,

Joseph forer, met with officials

of the United States Capitol Police on January 2, 1968,

concerning details of the proposed demonstration.

These '

individuals were advised by the United States Capitol Police

that they cannot demonstrate on the Capitol grounds in

a group or carry placards, as such activity is prohibited

by rules of Congress.

forer, as attorney for the group,

advised the officials that these women will be coming to

the Capitol as individuals and although they will be walking

together they can only be kept out of the Capitol building

if the

police

exclude all visitors from the United States

Capitol.. Forer argued that such a demonstration on the

Capitol grounds is not a violation of the law by the

participants but a violation of the United States Government

in refusing to allow its citizens to present their grievances

to Congress,

Captain Krahling advised that in addition to

Joseph foxer,

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of

edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern

mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear

testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started

Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-

out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including

Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations. •

(3)

Planning now at state and national levels for

conversion to peace-time economy and positive

efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific

actions suggested by individuals and groups

from all

over

the world.

Decision to participate jointly on any given

suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-.

ordinating Committee.

Effective cooperation with other

peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee

meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to

all and announced in mailings to members. There are no

dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For

Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at

local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations

On the national

the group attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-SOVIET

ZOLATIONS, Formerly known as Chicago

Conneil of American-Soviet Friendship

EDWIN GORDON FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,

Illinois, (now deceased) made available in January, 1954, the

"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated

publication which

stated that the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship

(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943. This document stated,

"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of

American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated

1 August 11,

(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard

national practice.

It should be noted, however, that the

Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its

affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive

Board,"

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to

the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would

be known as the Chicago Council of American-soviet Relations

(CCASR). MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of

the new organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that

MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily dissolved the

Board of Directors,

assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,

and was maintaining existing records of the organization at

his residence, 660 West Irving Paik Road, Chicago, Illinois.

The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be

to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.

While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program

followed the NCASE and it was in frequent contact with the

NCASF .

On November 5, 1958,

a third source advised that in

the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN

was a member-at-large of the

Communist Party (CP) of Illinois.

TERMAN was in Russia in

November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of

Jews and

to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the

leadership of the Soviet Union.

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN

SOVIET RELATIONS

In January, 1966,

a fourth source advised that the

CCASR went out of existence in the

Soring of 1965 due to

the

health condition of MANDEL A. PLIN.

The cifices oi the

CCASR, formerly located at 32 West

Randolph Street, Chicago,

were for a short time carried at HANDEL TERMAN'S home resi-

dence,

660 West Irving Park Road,

Chicago.

During the Fall

of 1965 due to the defunctness of the CCASR, the CP of Illinois

found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th

anniversary of the Russian Revolution under a temporary

committee called

The Chicago Committee for American-Soviet

Friendship Rally," This rally was held on November 7, 1965,

and once the rally was held this temporary committee went

out of existence.

The fourth source advised that as of the present

time the CCASR is defunct in the chicago area and any future

rally to be held on the American-soviet friendship theme will

have to be organized by the CP of illinois on a temporary

basis.

The NCASE has been desigratod pursuant in Executive

Order 10450.

CHICAGO CHAPTER

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his

understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NG) waS

formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicago

Chapter of the NG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the

national

group in New York, was formed shortly thereafter;

possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers

in protest against activities of the American Bar ASSOCAZü1OD

which they claimed was a non-liberal,

non-progressive

organization. The CCNLG has

no established headquarters

occasionally

uses the return address of its officials in

...

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war.

It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -- for those of the present as well as those

of future generations,

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

Jamiete ankin

A CALL

AMERICAN

WOMEN

who are outraged by the ruthless slaughter in Vietnam

and the persistent neglect of human needs at home

TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16 ..

AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don't vote. •

It is time for women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-

zens. WOMEN CAN ELECT the President they want; Women can determine the political, social and

economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let's use it to demonstrate our

opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.

We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American life. We shall meet in Washington

on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1. CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE

WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL

OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.

2. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME.

3. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED

LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.

• 4. CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND

REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL

COMPLEX.

After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position

on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and

mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country to a

position of honor in the community of nations.

On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A.M., and walk behind

our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.

On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by

presenting them to our Congressmen and Senators. We hope you can stay.

JEANNETTE RANKIN

HELENA, MONTANA

November 27, 1967

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a

woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress.

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who

must be concerned with the needs and development of the

human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and

join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening

day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

Dear WSPER:

"omen Strike for Peace nationally is suoporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.

Planeloads, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon

day, January 15th, from all over the country.

He are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first

time a real coalition of

women's peace groups, church groups, theatre personalities,.

and community leaders.

The Day is envisioned as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be

representing the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your Con-

gressmen urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Cäll as Con-

gress reconvenes.

Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to

report on Congressional responses.

We will all meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 Al and slowly walk to the

Capitol. We ask the women to wear black.

We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will

proceed

to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to

present our patition to the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike

ansfield and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be-

Fore the assembled women and the two Congressmen.

Leaving the Hill, the women will enter

juses for a motorcade to a Congress of American domen

(place to be announced).. Women

rill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,

Leading to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back to our comnunities for

Lementation.

Women may choose to remain in Washington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.

I you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality com

Ittee, 2140 P. St. Now. Washington, DO (293-2020). Ne regret that in order to get the

owest

train fare we had to guarantee return the same day; therefore you would have to

inance your own trip back on the l6th. .

Our hope is that 10,000 women will converge upon washington. We urge you to parti

ipate.

Yours for Peace,

Ethel Taylor

IO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN:

I an proud of the lact that my first vote cast in Congress

was a vote against the war.

It was the first opportunity

tox a woman to vote, because I was the first woman to be

elected to Congress.

I believed then,

as I do today, that women are the ones that

must be concerned ith the needs and development of the

human race. I have always tought for the dignity. of

al1

human beings - for those of the present as well as those

of suture generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all

women will respond to the following call

and join me in

With highest hopes,

women will no longer give their sons and loved ones to a government

and industrial machine rather than its people...

women will no longer consent to raise their children in the blight

in to they eon. borer the oh a no one longer

We ask our government to design and carry out a domestic program

commensurate with the needs of the American people; to foltow a

policy of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries; to

pursue our official committment to disarmament, and to respect

international law.

American women who, as women everywhere, are the bearers and conservers

of life, will not stand ídly by as life is destroyed. in our name.

About two hundred Oahu women have signed the following petition to

Congress:

As Congress reconvenes, we urge that its first order of business

be to put an end to the war

in Vietnam and arrange for the withdrawal

of. American troops; and that the Congress turn its attention to

ameliorating

the crisis in America.

We urge the Congress to heal a sick society at home, to make reparations

for the ravaged land we leave behind in Vietnam and to refuse to

listen to the insatiable demands of the military-industrial complex.

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

JANUARY 15, 1968

Chairman of the Brigade, announced to the demonstrators that this

local demonstration was principally gathered to

support women

from around the. United States who were gathered in Washington,

D.C. today, as part of a nation-wide demonstration sponsored by

the Jeannette

Rankin Brigade, to petition Congress to resolve

the conflict in Vietnam.

Bridges stated that inasmuch as it

was not possible for the demonstrators to personally contact

their congressmen, most of whom were out of town; that following

the presentation of a petition to Mayor Joseph Alioto, the

lemonstrators would then proceed to the western Union Office or

10th and Market Streets

in San Francisco, so that the womer

protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting

United States policies in Vietnam.

Bridges indicated that the

petitioners would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress

their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its

First order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and

immediately arrange for

withdrawal of all American troops from

Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society

at home and to make reparations

for the ravaged lands left

behind in Vietnam.

A

source advised March

1 2, 1967, that Mrs. M.

Bridges, also known as

Nikki Bridges, 35

Kronquest Court, San Francisco, California, was

lIsted as a reciplent or a new

yearly subscription

to the "People's World" (PW), expiration date:

March 4, 1968.

The PW is a west coast communist newspaper, •

published

weekly in San Francisco.

The next speaker was identified as Aileen Hernandez.

She spoke

for approximately five minutes and briefly explained

to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes

of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade are. She stated that the group

has no principal spokesman and it is principally a group of

women who are involved and committed in a fight for peace.

Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,

then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present

their petition.

Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of

San Francisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced

to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their

petition to Congress.

believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assembly.

He indicated, however, that because he had consented to

transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not

necessarily agree with it.

The Mayor then stated that it

was his personal opinion that the United States Government and

the Johnson Administration had done all in its power to attempt

to come to a peaceful and honorable solution in the Vietnamese

War. He related that he felt that it was now up to the other

side to make the same attempts to arrive at a peaceful solution

in the Vietnamese conflict.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded

to the Western Union Office located at l0th and Market Streets

in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen

in Washington.

A Special Agent of the FBI observed one Elaine

Toneda participating in the above demonstration and following m?

the demonstration loneda was observed to return to ner employment

at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Unior

(ILWU) - Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150

Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco.

A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that

Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist

Party. (CP). .

On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI

observed a silent protest by a

group of women on the lawn

of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.

These women were ostensibly gathered

to support the demonstration

being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin

Brigade.

There were

no

speeches given; the demonstrators merely

conducted a silent vigil.

A one page leaflet captioned "Women Io Take First

Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,

at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to a memorandum,

captioned as

above, dated December 28,

1967, at Miami, Florida. The memorandum

concerned a call issued by the Jeannette

Rankin Brigade for American Women to travel

to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,

to petition the United States Congress to

end the war in Viet Nam.

A source, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami

Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and

Freedom (WILPF) had scheäuled a demonstration to take place

January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida.

The demonstration

would be a support activity for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade

that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition

Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.

The January 16, 1968, issue of

the "Miami Herald,"

a local Miami, Florida

newspaper, contained an article entitled

"Five Thousand Women Join Viet Vir Frotest."

The article, identified Jeanette Pankin

as an 87

"year old woman pacifist

and

former member of Congress who voted in

Congress against the American entry into

both world wars.

A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi

gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war

demonstration take place in Miami, Florida. Approximately

70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the

Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at

2:00 p.m. They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

would remain at home and fight the racists. She also said,

can't honestly get up and say the pledge of allegiance to

so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.

Wright said that her arrest at the hands of Los

Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright

result. She said that at the time of her arrest it had been •

necessary for the arresting officers to drag her down the

hall as she was

too heavy for them to carry.

Then she added

that the next time she is arrested the officers will not have

that excuse as she has lost thirty pounds in the meantime.

The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and

audience. The women were then ushered into the public board

room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at

which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators

a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the

women.

One question, as to how much longer the members of the

and worked actively in the SCHW; however, since the formation

of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged

a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a

Communist Party front organization because it has gone along

with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly

on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that

George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed

great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and

the view

that the scEr is the best organization in the south

better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,

and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the

SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.

APPENDI

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times" .

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the

formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC

intended to promulgate

"the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to

neutralize the distorted American press:

"'The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Di. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber

as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and Taber

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963,

a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Forkers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FFCC policy. This source added that during the past

year there had been a

successful effort by FPCC leadership to

minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC

so that

their influence as of

May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that Vincent

"Ted" Tee, FICC National Office Director, we then formulating

FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of

permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization.

This source stated that lee believed that the FPCC should .

advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between. Cuba and

the United States and should support the right of

Cubans to manage their revolution without intezterence from

other nations. Lee 2id

not advocate supportir; the Cuban

revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"

reported that Senator thomas o.

Dodd of Connecticut had called

FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network

in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was

a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which

twice conducted hcarings on the FPCC.

## Page 409

_UBA & OMMITTEE (CONT' D)

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World

regram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC

-was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity

during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street

rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active

propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively briei span of life was attributed to mounting

anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional

hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United

Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which

the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf

by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second

source advised that V. T. Lee had recently remarked that the

FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another

similar urganization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there

had not been any FPCC

activity in many months and that the

FPCC had been dissolved.

Rumors were rampant.

arrests. It was also stated police had prepared for five

hundred arrests; that all telephones into the demonstration

march was still being withheld.

After the California group

had been briefed, the following instructions were read to

the Washington delegates by MALVINA REYNOLDS of California:

(1) Maintain silence throughout the march.

on the sidewalk.

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were mildly self-

critical about not working for the programs the younger women

were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long

hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January

20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church

in Seattle at which

the

Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,

however, that the women working on the program were all very

experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a

satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including

the group from washington State, met at the Union Station in

Washington, DC: It was learned here that the instructions

which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were

evidently for the California group only, because many California

people had been badly beaten in previous demonstrations and

they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive.

official pattern was different.

"Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were

passed out and

these appeared to be the official instructions.

A reproduction is attached.

The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a

Mrs BACKUP from Tacoma arrived.

RADER said some of the money

usually received from wealthy contributors had been collected

by

• Mrs. BACKUP.

Reverend HAROLD BASS of Tacoma collected

•, "...

$1?0. 00, and wanted someone eise to go instead of ZEFRA

( STUDAMIRE) •

RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized

her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months

~pregnant.

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much

of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some-

thing about the

status of the American Indian.

ELLA BAKER from

New York did include a paragraph irom the paper the Washington

State delegation submitted to Congress.

This

was entitled,

"American indians and the Struggle for Peace". It had been

prepared by LONNIE HEALY although at its bottom it carried the

notation

"(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation

from

Washington State)."

RADER, HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the

audience did not give a

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the

basic organization i:

the gathering.

She wanted an organi-

zational meeting instead of a raily type meeting which

occurred. HALONEN

and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied

the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN

worked in the legislative action section; HELEN

FRENCH and

ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and

CORR in racism.

Here, too, the younger women were very

critical. HEALY

"rasource people" Particularly, resented having men as

• the group.

She said she thought this

was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a

situation that was quite different in that she was working

with a

very broad spectrum of

politically and economically oriented

individuals and it was a real learning experience.. ELAINE

HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while

the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh.

She and

HELEN FRENCH expressed

the view the congress met the needs

of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Tuesday, January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The

Seattle and Tacoma people were

told

to meet at the Methodist

Building, 100 Maryland Avenue.

HALONEN,

ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,

and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about

an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem

and would be unable to attend.

Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.

LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early.

The

group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,

but they were not in their offices: After leaving a copy of

the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the

Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)

they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and

BROCK ADAMS.

Mr, HICKS waS OuT OI tOWn. MrS. HORSLEY knew. the. --

Congressman personally and her son knew two of the office

personnel.

She asked that they relate to him that she was

vitally interested in peace and social justice.

Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office

and spent

about twenty minutes talking with the

group concerning his

political views and some of

the political machinations of his

party.

The group then began to disintegrate.

left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her

The delegates weren't premitted to carry a nail file,

wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons.

They had to walk

six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White

House. She said a suit will be brought in court for this

denial of their rights.

She went on to state each person had

or was given

$10.00 to carry on his person so he could not

be arrested for vagrancy.

CASSIDY said a nurse,

Mrs. HELEN Mo, COOK, had been

very helpful to the group.

cooK told CASSIDY she could be reached

at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information

is desired concerning

GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop

CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too

immature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't

easy to stop.

She was incensed over the fact money had been used

for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate.

DIA'S MED THE STRUGGLE FO

Iician

wich a rif'e butü. Sone Indian youth vice the television piogra

¿listeri as indicaiive of racist Anerica. The National Congress of American

Indians opposes nis distortion of history. Beatings and nurder of Indians

in liaine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land

reservations to state jurisdiction. In actuality, this rides established

iribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives

local bigoted authorities

more opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties

and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It Is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier

in Viet Nam.

In che chree years before 1907, more Indian children

below the

age of lû had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of

tle entire Viet Nan War (as of the end of 1960). Mosü of these were children

below the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in

school, over television, in cartoons; the Indian has become a joise, to white

Anericans. We pay because we don't know our own history.

The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history

of Indian-Americans.

When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go

deep into their history in

finding nourishment for this demand.

Just as some

Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B. DuBois as having raised the same issue of

identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.

This struggle has gone on for 400 years.

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances

and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

ycars.

They have fought in the courts since at least 1830 when the case of

the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the

United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is a continuation of the whole racist war we have

waged against the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding

the Viet Nam war. We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet

the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and

destruction of their identity.

We must unite with the strivings of those who have had to deal with

United States' genocide for 200 years!

We can help io push the United States to ratify the United Nations

Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct

the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people. Today this

refers to the destruction of their identity as a people and lintie with the

struggles of people for their identity all over the world. Io stop the policy

of genocide, of racian, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of

the crimes

against the

people!

All the forces in this country cannot win democratic power without

maiting this correction of what was done to the American Indian people.

Upon informing the Capitol Police of their planned march to the Capitol building

to present their petition, the wmon were threatened with arrest wer 40 U.s.C.

193 (a) et. seg. which, after defining the area considered Capitol Grounds, states:

"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions

or assemblages in said United States Capitol Grounds, or to

display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or

adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization,,

or movement......

The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions

will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol

Police. The exceptions are allowed on "ocassions of national interest becoming

the congnizance and entertainment of Congress."

The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the

entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which

was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which

is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to

declare it unconstitutional.

We have asked the Federal District Court for the

District of Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to

January 15th. Our request was denied.

The same request was made to the District

of Columbia Court of Appeais and was likewise denied.

As it was then impossible

to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the

appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence

of ultimate victory.

This is far from the last

time that these women or any other Americans intend

to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

nern welfare programs in the laltod States bir. with passage of

Tine Social Securli: hitin 1955, authorizing lederal grants to

sintes Ior pubilc assistance and chila welfare programs.

Tr. 1937.

the Washington Legislature repealed the Erupors Low of 185iy and

enacted a state social security Low. "Wellore" has boen a bone of

contention ever since.

Greenleigh Report

In 1963, the Washington Legislature appropriated $20,000 for a study

of the state's public assistance programs.

The study was made by

Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presentod in

December; 1964.

report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standar

s based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions,t? e 40% below the minimum

standards for health and decency.

Speaking of child

welfare needs, the report sald: "There 1s an excessive

and increasing rate of referral of children to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.

There 1s an excessive and Increasing trend for children

to be removed from their natural families and cared

for olsewhere,"

WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions. The 196?

Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring 1t's

pricing standard's up to 1967 levels.

New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances

for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increased

an average of 10-3/4%cIn King County the total Increase was 16%.

Thus, King County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,

but the cost of Ilving has increased by at least 5% Grants are st11

17% less than acceptable levels.

The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of

two aduLts,

a boy 13, and a 81r1 8, 1s $285.80 a

nonth--$3,429 a year.

But recent changes in the

Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even

this figure.

The local welfare officials will not

offer any guess as to whnt my happen nest. NEW RATABLE

REDUCTIONS ARE ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

There is much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to

work.

Yet who will take care of the children?

Child care costs fron

$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle.

Some examples of women's wages:

Nurses Aid • $1.40 per hour

NOLE ACT FOR PEACE (SWAP)

A source reported on May 17, 1952, a meeting of the

Ballard-Greenwood CP Club was held in

I Seattle, April 25, 1962,

at which TAIMI HALONEN was nominajed to be the new Chairman of

this Club. Along with other business of the evening, HALONEN

said she expected to devote a good portion of her time to SWAP,

an organization of peace forces that met recently with seven

members.

She said four of the seven were from the "left" but

did not go into detail. She said the group had problems of an

organizational nature because it was new, and she thought she

could help.

on April 5, 1963, a second source stated a meeting of

the University CP Club was held at Seattle on

April 2, 1963.

KEN ROSE, a member of the club, reported the most influential

peace organization in seattle was SWAP.

on July 31, 1964, a meeting of the North Central CP

Section Committee was held at Seattle. WILL PARRY, Section

Chairman, said attention should be placed on three

political

questions - peace, civil rights, and labor. Under peace, he

said CP clubs should inject the

Women Act for Peace campaign

into the election campaign. At another Section meeting,

February 5, 1966, TAIMI HALONEN was praised for effective

peace work and for her help in developing unity among the peace

forces.

Section-wide concentration was urged in assisting

SWAP to visit 1,000 workers on the Vietnam issue.

A chira source advised on february 24, 1960, a

Northwest District Cr Committee meeting was held at Seattle

February 12, 1956. After lunch, the entire group participated

in passing

out leaflets pertaining to racial

matters and the

Vietnam war which carried the name of SWAP, 5411 Ravenna Avenue

Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98105, which address has been

used consistently by SWAP and is that of ANCI KOPpEL, also known

as Mrs. CHARLES KOPPEL. KOPPEL has been and continues to be

the coordinator and apparent prime motivating force of SWAP

as of May, 1967.

A fourth source reported in 1945

ANCI KOPPEL WaS a member of the

Professional Group of the Communist

Political Association (CPA), also

known as the Rogers CP Club at

Seattle, Washington.

The CPA has been designated by the

directed the CP State Board to set up a Party

committee for this purpose:

The above source also reported that at a state-wide

CP conference held on August 27, 1950, CP District Chairman

BURT NELSON reported on the woo.

NELSON announced the committee

was determined to have the bookstore opened by the earliest

possible date, probably October 15, (1960). He urged support

of the wcC.

A second source in February and March, 1960, advised

a committee of CP members during those months commenced organi-

zation of the WCC with authorized capital of $2,000 which was.

to sell shares and make other plans for operation of a bookstore

selling

"progressive" literature at Seattle.

In May and June,

1960,

this source reported BURT NELSON, On May 18, 1960, stated

the CP District Literature Comnission would concern itself with

the bookstore and other types of literature to be sold. On

May 31, 1960, BURT NELSON suggested October 1, 1960, as the

tentative opening date of the bookstore.

second source advised on November 2, 1960, the

principal aim of the WCC is to establish a bookstore in the

Seattle area inasmuch as this need has long been recognized by

the Washington State CP due to difficulties

encountered in main-

taining a Party literature apparatus, and it is desired to have

available public facilities to attract supporters and sympathizers.

This source stated the WiC has obtainea a location for its

bookstore at 710 stevart Street, Seattle, and operations

commenced at that location on November 5, 1960.

A third source advised on May 1, 1967, that the WCC

held its annual meeting of shareholders at the Roosevelt Hotel,

Seattle, on April 30, 1967. As a pari

of the business at this

meeting, a report was made on the financial status of "Co-op

information:

On January 15, 1968, a group of approximately 175

women gathered at the Pennsylvania Railroad 30th Street

Station in Philadelphia, Pa.

They boarded three special

coaches on the 8:10 a.m. train for Washington, D.C.

group was the Philadelphia Contingent of the Jeannette Rankin PA, D.C

Brigade which was

going to petition the Congress of the

United States against the War in Vietnam.

The train arrived at Washington, D.C., at about

10:45 a.m. The group remained at Union Station, Washington,

minority group under the leadership of National Committee

member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority grouD,

referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program

and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics

retreating from the fight for the world socialist

revolution.

The final issue which ultimately forced the

split was

policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party.

(CP) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority

as petty-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,

advocated unconditional detense of the Soviet Union and has

This matter was opened by the San Francisco Office

on November 1?, 1967, on receipt of information from|st 1773-5

that an organization known as the Jeannette Rankin Brigade had

sent out a call for a demonstration to be held at the White

House, Washington, D. C., on January 8, 1968, in protest of

the war in Vietnam. As noted in referenced San Francisco

communication, the above efforts culminated in a demonstration

at Ser. Francisco, California, on January 15, 1968, and a conpanion

ciemonstration held in Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968.

A review of the san [rancisco files in the above matter

reflects that NIKKI'BRIDEES, San Francisco Chairman of the Seagade,

March 2, 1967, listed as a recipient of'a new yearly sub-.

On January 31, 1968, at a mectior of the Marin

county chapter of the women international League For

Peace and Freedom

(WILPE), ISE 2955-Sl aquired that guing

a seneral discussion concerning the brigade, it was felt

that the group did not want the Brigade to become another

formalized group, but rather keep the Brigade as a loose

organization, and as an umbrella group for the WILPF.

San Francisco files in addition reflect that:

there has

not been at any time a known group of members

of the Brigade; rather the organization has been sponsored

by women on both a local and national level, many of whom

aro nembers of varied women's peace groups.

In view of the above information, indicating a lack

of specific membership and future activity, no further inves-

tigation is being conducted by the San Francisco Office under

the Jeannetto Rantin triguie caption at the present time, UACB.

This matter will be closely followed and should any

future information received by the San Franciaco defice arrear

to "errant additional investigation, this matter will be reopened.

reliable information in the

Commune Office, 640 Broadway, New York City (NYC), which

was attended by 30 to 40 females.

It was learned

that a

woman from the New York (NY) group was already in washington,

D.C. working with others

there to arrange permits, speakers,

et cetera, for the women's march on the Pentagon on April 10,

1971. It was stated that it was easier to obtain a permit

for a march from the Justice Department to the Pentagon,

than from the

Pentagon to the Justice Department, but that

no permit had been obtained as yet.

It was pointed out that

a march from the Pentagon to the Justice Department was

preferred as there would be less chance of losing marchers

en route to the Justice Department than from marching

from the Justice Department to the Pentagon. It was stated

that no buses had been chartered at NY, but it was hoped that

15 buses would be needed.

Law Commune

on september 1o, 1909, a second source, who

has furnished reliable information in the

past, advised that the law Commune is not an

organization in the usual sense of the word.

It is rather a law firm comprised of a group

of lawyers interested and sympathetic to the

New Left and Black Power organizations, and who

counsel and defena individuals in these groups

as the occasion arises.

They likewise permit

their premises to be used on occasion as a meeting

place for these organizations and distribute

some of their literature.

on March 25, 1971, the second advised that as of

now there is much confusion

over the mechanical aspects of

the Women's National March on April 10, 1971, and that the

people in Washington, D.C. will make the ultimate decision

regarding the route of the march.

The source stated that

in Ny, Information concerning buses for washington, D.C.

will be available at the Upper West Side Women's Center,

627 Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, telephone number 874-6696.

On March 24, 1971, the second source made available

a piece of literature

sent out by the "April 10 Women's

Committee" concerning the national women's march on the

Pentagon on April 10. This literature contained in part as

follows:

"We are going to the pentagon on April 10 to

serve notice on our enemies that women are moving against

them.

Our urgency and our fury at the expansion of the

Indochinese war and our rage at the repression of our black

and brown sister's and brothers needs expression right now.

We are joining with other women to struggle for the everyaay

things we need and against whatever and whoever prevents us

from getting them.

"We need and want our sisters around the country

to build for this action in their own ways, and to communicate

with other sisters their ideas,

suggestions and criticisms.

"Dear Mme. Binh,

"On April 10, many of us American women will be

marching on the Pentagon. You know already of the other

actions being planned here against the war.

As women, we

are coming out from separate cities and roles, trying

to

create reality out of what we once held looked up in our

imaginations.

In marching on the pentagon, we are joining with

all people inside and outside of Amerika, who fight against

Amerika's attempt to control us.

"We've been conditioned so long to accept Amerika's

definition of us as weak, passive, and powerless, and to deny

all our feelings of love

and strength, that it has been a

struggle for us to turn towards each other and fight for our

freedom.

"Your own long struggle in Indochina, and the struggle

of third world people here at home, awakened us to the

destruction that Amerikan power represents all over the world.

Your many victories against that power have been an inspiration

to us.

But it wasn't until we joined together to examine and

share

our own experiences as women in Amerika that we saw

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society, commonly

known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention

held during June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an

initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist-

• Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant

during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create

a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement

in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position

to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up

the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

All major factions within SDS embrace Marxism-Lenism

and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North

Vietnam as countries leading the worldwide struggles

However, the soviet Union

was regarded as imperialist and with the Communist Party,

United States of America, "I visionist" in nature.

SDS operated under a national constitution which

called for an annual Nationa. Convention (NC) and quarterly

National Council meetings wherein programs were initiated

and debated.

Three national officers were elected annually

with a National Interim Committee to run the organization.

Regional offices and college chapters elected delegates to

-he national meetinas but each functioned independently on

local matters.

Its official publicition "Fire"

(formerly

"New Left Notes") last appeared in lecember, 1969.

Internal factionalism of serious proportions

developed during 1968 - 1969 and tle following three factions

evolved as a result of a split at he June, 1969, NC:

Weatherman, Worker Student Alliance (WSA), and Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM) •

effect of the split on SDS chapters

throughout the country was divisive.

some aligned with one

of the other of the three major factions.

Others, unable to

identify with any faction, disassociated

with SDS

completely

and changed names.

The SDS national office in recent years was

located at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. It

was closed in February, 1970.

WEATHIERMAN

APPENDIX

Initially called the "Action Faction," Weatherman

came into being immediately before the June, 1969, Students

for a Venocratic Society (SDS) National Convention (NC).

At this iC Weatherman won all three national officer positions

and a majority of the National Interin Committee as well.

subsequently, they took over the SDS National Office (NO)

in Chicago, and controlled its funds, paper and national

records. Although internal struggle existed until late 1969,

Weatherman for all major purposes controlled SDS nationally

from June, 1969, until its 1:0 closed in February, 1970. At

this time it no longer considered itself part of

:..

The term Weatherman

emerged

fron an ideological

paper prepared by its leaders entitled "you Don't ileed a

weatherman to know Which Way the wind Blows" ("New Left

Notes" June 18, 1969). This statement outlined the basic

stance of Weatherman: Marxist-leninist in content but with .

strong advocacy that action not theory would bring about

revolution in the United States.

This posture was complemonted

with an international identification to

the Cuban revolution

and CASTRO's statement that the duty of a revolutionary is

to make revolution.

During October, 1969, Weatherman riots

in

Chicago resulted in more than 260 arrests for nob action

and related charges.

A program of

armed struggle was

finalized during a Deceuber, 1969,

"War Council" wherein

terrorist tactics and political assassination were

contemplated.

The basic strength of Weatherman was then

revealed to be some 300 - 350 nationally and geographically

apportioned to the Midwest, New York, and some Northwest.

As its rhetoric of violence escalated, Weatherman

leaders increasingly discussed the necessity of an underground

operation wherein more than 90 percent of the organization

would be submerged; "affinity groups" of three - five members

would function independently.

In February, 2970, Weatherman

leaders announced a program of "strategic sabotage" with

police and military installations as primary targets.

In

February, 1970, Heathersan abandoned

the

SDS NO, 1608 West Madison Stroet, Chicar, Illirois, and

throughout the country arterid an

a split arose between the Progressive Labor Party (PuP) ano

support among those in attendanse at the NC.

Source further advised that during late Summer,

1969, the PLP faction of SDS established its National

Headquarters (NH) on the second floor of a loft-type

building at 173A Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.

The campaign on which the PLP faction

centered was to build

alliance. Thus, they adopted the names of Worker

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH MOVEMENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth

Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,

from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was

decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary

Youth Movement (RYM), characterized as a mass anti-imperialist

youth organization,

said organization being proposed

separate and distinct in form and content from SDS.

The

"Principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included

struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy: fights

against imperialism, anticommunism, fascism and oppression

of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of

all "oppressed nations," also support of the right of all

"oppressed and exploited" peoples "to armed self-defense."

It was agreed that RYM would not be a Marxist-Leninist

organization; however, source said this was decided in order

to indicate an organization broad enough in form to be

acceptable to everyone. A temporary National Steering

Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males was

elected to govern RYM until national officers could be

elected during the Spring of 1970.

RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office

(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 C,

both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that

the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as

located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta.

Second source advised that women dominated the

founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC

meetings to the point that "women's liberation" has apparently

become the RYM's principal issue - also that RYM's poor

financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish

a paper.

During early 1970, RYM has decided to cater to

the working class rather than youth, since the potential for

social revolution lies in workers.

A third source has stated that it was decided at

the March, 1970, NSC meeting

that RYM women had decided the

organization will be molded into a "working class, Marxist-

Leninist, revolutionary, anti-imperialist, problack

nationalist, people's women's liberation organization."

A characterization of the SDS

is set out separately.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

The "New York Times" city edition Tuesday,

April 20, 1965, Page 27,

reported that a new party of

"revolutionary

socialism" was formally founded on April 18,

1965, under the name of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP),

which had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor

Movement was founded in 1962, by MILTON ROSEN and MORTIMER

SCHEER after they were expelled from the Communist Party of

the United States for assertedly following the Chinese

Communist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP

held its Second National Convention in New

York City, May 31,

to June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its

objective of the establishment of a militant working class

movement based on Marxism-Leninism.

The source also advised that at the Second National

Convention, MILTON ROSEN was unanimously re-elected National

Chairman of the PLP and LEVI LAUB, FRED JEROME, JARED ISRAEL,

WILLIAM EPTON, JACOB ROSEN, JEFFREY GORDON and WALTER LINDER

were elected

as the National Committee to lead the PLP until

the next convention.

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly

magazine, and "Challenge-Desafio,"

" a monthly newspaper.

Source advised on May 25, 1970, that the PLP

utilizes an address of General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn,

New York, and also utilizes an office in room 617, 1 Union

Square West, New York, New York.

According to information received from the Washington Field

Office and Domestic Intelligence Division, the /'April Tenth Women's Committee"

of New York City, a recently formed group of women's protest organizations,

plans a "March on the Pentagon" on Saturday, 4/10/71, as an anti-war protest.

Plans call for the protesters, who may number as many as 5, 000, to assemble

at L'Enfant Square, Constitution Avenue, between Seventh and Ninth Streets,

Northwest, between 11:00 a.m. and noon, and thereafter march to the Pentagon

via Constitution Avenue and Memorial Bridge. The demonstration is scheduled.

to end around 5:00 p.m. The Committee has reportedly chartered 14 busses

capable of carrying 630 passengers from New York City to Washington. The

busses are scheduled to unload at the Justice Building, where it is reported the

women will demonstrate. It is noted that L'Enfant Square, the assembly point

for the demonstrators, is within one block of the Justice Building. The protesters

are then scheduled to march to the Pentagon, where they will hold another

demonstration and will be picked up by the busses at the Pentagon.

General Services Administration (GSA) and Department security

officials are cognizant and plan to reinforce the guard force at the Tenth Street

Auto Entrance, which is the only Justice Building entrance open on Saturday.

Since we do not conduct tours on Saturday, no adjustment in our tours is neces-

sary.

Boston file 100-38735 entitled "EVAN PATCHEN

DELLINGER, aka PATCH DELLINGER; SM - ANARCHIST (BUFILE

100-450998)" reflected that DELLINGER was subject of

Boston investigation based on his participation in a

"Teach-In"

and Rededication Service on 1/29/68 at the

Arlington St. Church, Boston. During the above activity,

DELLINGER made a statement in support of the "Resistance

Group" and turned in what was reported so be Selective

Service cards.

The primary function of the Resistance Group

was to aid, abet, and counsel young men faced with the

draft.

EVANY PATCHEN DELLINGER graduated from Swarthmore

College, Swarthmore, Pa., on 6/6/66 majoring ir economics.

He was arrested at Chester, Pa. on 4/1/54 and was charged

with disorderly conduct.

The 1968-59 Harvard University Directory of

Officers and Students reflected that DELLINGER was enrolled

in the School of Medicine, Harvard University, Cambridge,

Mass.

It had been reported that PATCH DELLINGER waS

present at a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) Street Meeting

in New York City on 7/21/64.

The file further disclosed that inasmuch as the

Boston office had no current information associating DELLIN-

GER with the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance and that

his activities on behalf of the New England Resistance were

pacifist in nature, it was felt that DELLINGER did not

warrant inclusion on the Security or Agitator Indexes main-

tained at that time; and thus, the case was placed in a closed

status.

Rededication

• Services at the Arlington St. Church in Boston

on 1/29/68 at which 23 individuals turned in either

Notice of Classification and/or a Registration Certificate.

Two other individuals turned in some other type of document.

It was determined that DELLINGER had turned in a Selective

Service Registration Certificate and two Notices of Classi-

fication issued by LB #28, Flemington, New Jersey. Also,

a two-page statement signed PATCHEN DELLINGER supporting

the Resistance movement was turned in.

In April, 1972, AUSA, Boston declined any prosecu-.

the CCL.

The files of the Chicago Office contain no informa-

tion of a subversive nature concerning MINER.
