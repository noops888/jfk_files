at the request of the Legal Attache,

contacted these sources to determine if ANGELO BRUNO had

financial dealings in the gambling casino at the Plaza

Hotel, Havana, Cuba (5)

On April 24, 1961, Colonel

advised that

NI-5's confidential sources had stated that Lloyds of

London had acted as the reinsurer for the American Inter-

national Reinsurance Corporation of New York City to the

extent of $70,000.00 for a policy made out to the subject

certainly jeopardize MI-5's future relation with the

Lloyas concern. (5)

Colonel CUMMING also pointed

that Lloyds

asts as a reinsurance organization for other insurance

companies, and any money paid by Lloyds is paid not to

the

individual policy holders but to other insurance companies

to help them cover their losses when heavy demands are put

upon their resources by their own policy holders. (S)

No information was obtained indicating that

subject or any of his associates had any kind of insurance

policy other than the fire insurance policy mentioned above,

and no information was

available identifying the officers

of the corporation, of which subject was a member.

The above information was furnished by airtel

to the New York and the Miami Divisions on May 12, 1961,

with instructions to use discretion as outlined above in

conducting investigation regarding this matter.

It is noted that proof of this payment could

logically be grounds for a successful prosecution by the

Internal Revenue Service;

and, accordingly, it is

requested that this investigation receive continuous

attention.
