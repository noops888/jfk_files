PH-591-C* was authorized 8/31/60, installed

10/26/60, and activated 10/27/60.

At time of installation, facilities were

available for two separate microphones, insofar as bring-

ing the microphones into the central office were concerned.

Bureau has been advised in recent communications of the

anticipated increase in telephone facilities at the Maggio

Cheese Company, 1030 South-11th Street, Philadelphia.

This

matter has been followed closely.

On 9/14/61, Philadelphia Division contacts at

Bell Telephone Company advised that the Maggio Cheese Com-

pany has requested an increased telephone facilities of

fifty per cent.

This will necessitate the installation of

an additional PBX and will place two telephones on each

In this process, it has also been arranged that an

additional pair of wires running fron the central orfice

can be obtained with the net result being that two addi-

tional microphones can be installed at

the present loca-

The increased coverage would afford coverage to all three of-

fices and should result in increased intelligence and general

info re captioned subject.

rechnically, the installations with have to be in-

stalled using altered

44A blocks which will have to be

installed under pretext during the process of increasing the

Maggio Company's present facilities. This

was the method

used in first installation and complete security can be ob-

tained again in the present installation. It is thereby

requested that the Bureau authorize this

increased installa-

tion and that the Lab, Electronics Section, furnish the

Philadelphia Division two altered 44A blocks.

For Bureau info, it is

noted that the telephone

company is beginning instant installation during the coming

week and Philadelphia, at this time, can furnish no specific

date that the opportunity will arise to increase activities

of PH-591-C*.

Philadelphia Division, however, has to be in

the position to move when the opportunity presents itse Is

It is thereby requested that this matter be expedited

and that the altered

.44A blocks, if Bureau permission is ob-

tained, be forwarded to reach the Philadelphia Division no

later than Wednesday, 9/20/61.
