MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Meeting between DDCI and Chairman Stokes, HSCA

1.

The DDCI, with Mr. Hitz and the undersigned, met

with Chairman Stokes yesterday afternoon at the Cannon

Building. Mr. Blakey was with Mr. Stokes.

The discussion covered the five points in the

letter

of 11 September from Mr. Stokes as follows:

The question of the "mug book" has been

a .

resolved.

b.

We believed that the "missing memorandum"

had, in fact, been

reviewed on five separate occasions

in two different files.

The problem was that it did

not bear a number, although in a series of sequentially

numbered debriefing memoranda of AMMUG. However, the

time of the memo was such that it had

to fall between

others

in that sequence, and was on the subject

(Oswald) in which they were interested. The HSCA

investigator had been told of this. Mr. Stokes

asked that we simply write a letter explaing this,

and stating

our opinion that this was the case.

C.

The security files of the employee, which

they wished to review were described by the DDCI

as containing

information of a personal nature about

the employee.

Mr. Blakey or Mr. Cornwell could

review it.

This was accepted.

After emphasizing the sensitivity@t the

City history, the irrelevance of

years

to the inquiry, and

the nature of the Agency's

status there,

the DDCI stated that Mr. Blakey and

Mr. Cornwell could review it in unsanitized form.

That was accepted.

Mr. Blakey then stated that

there was an allegation that Proenza had been recalled

interest in Proenza was based on the coincidence

in time of her being recalled to Cuba, but were

not previously aware of either of the

two allega-

tions Blakey revealed). On the basis of this show-

ing of relevancy the DDCI agreed for Mr. Blakey

to review the file of the special operation for

the period requested.

Mr. Blakey stated that he

could read Spanish sufficiently well to handle it

personally.

It is noted that Mr. Blakey stated that the

Mexico City story is to be told in the public hearings

without any reference to CIA, or its presence in Mexico.

Mr. Blakey also stated that no testimony will

be sought from the DCI until December.
