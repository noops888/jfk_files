MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: Cuba TDY - Edward G. Tichbarn (P)

03 1. On 12 January and 13 January I talked with

Jof wa Division to firm up details ra Tichborn's briefing here

da 15 January and IS preparations for his trip to cube.

2.

Re the briefing, It was decided that: (1) Mr.L

Subject a gonaral briefing on the Cuban political situation (the sajor me

will be undertaken by the Statica) egg (2),

Subject will be given sanitized

copies af the ferlongo (?) reportI

7 Section IV, and af the report

prepared by the Plaas Branch/PP/Mb antitled "Target Study of Oppositio

Groups in Cuba to be read by Subject while at the briefing and then returned

to 113.. Some observations. on security will probably also be mado at this

time in addition to instructions on the minner of keeping and subaltting his

financial, accounting: It should, ta mentioned here also that lil sinance/admin

I 1s of the opinion that since Tichborn w1l1 return to washingtor

In about 24 woers time, it is not necessary for him to subuit his accounts

my mall, stnce that can be taken care of on his réturn.)

3;

The problen which seaned to need most careful consideration was

that of bis cover walle in Cuba,

In taliding to operational contacts he

makes there, the cover story suggested by the Station In IN-47609 of 12 Nov.

1959 appears adeguate.' However, according to Pan American Airways, upon

arrival in Havana the visitor is Issued a tourist card by the Cuban

Immigration authorities.

One must state his profession at this time, which

should present no problem to Tichborn.

It could be that one is also asked

bis reason for keing In-Cubs. In this case, WH has suggestod that the

answer ofuPtourist would be best since less suspicion would be placed on

Subject in the beginning.

The important aspect, however, appears to be

that of covering Tichborn as well as possible in the event that he runs

afoul of the Cuban authorities due to the naturo of his activities and hís

coptacts. I brought this matter up with WH and they agreed that some kind

of backstopping might be a good idea. As a result, l contacted M. Strange

al Cover Division who assured ne that, 1f neessery, an appropriate letter

pon as the post logical was thel

which had originally bees provided for funding Iichbor.

„euggested the wording of such a lotter (the baste

Ides of which would bo for Subject to combine business with pleasure) which

I will write up (ir agreed upon by AC/PAD/IP) in flaal draft, and Cover

Divialon will then transfer it to the approprtate letterhesd.

However, I

advised both Mi3 (l'ooney) and Mr. Stringe thut before going into this satter

further, I would have to chack this whole matter out with you on I January.

4o as far as financing 1g concerned, Mr.-

of this matter and as of 13 January,

the quot for the evance 182a8 caro

has been approved.

The request for one-half of Tichbora's salary, ($650)

must avalt approval until Subject has aigned the amendsent to his contract

(which was received by this offleo on tody:s date).

Mt. Strange has agreed to provide paymont of Tichborn by a check drawn.

on the cover company to be deposited with Subjectly bank. (I guess the

final decision on this will depend on how Subject wants the maney, wether

a bank deposit or cash.) If done through the cover company and sent to

Tichborn's bank, wa should allow at least four or five days for the

deposit to be made, depending upon the speed of the postal system.
