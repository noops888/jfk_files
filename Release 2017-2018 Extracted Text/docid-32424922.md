MILITARY

General Benjamin T. Harris, DOD/JCS Representative for

Operation Mongoose, states:

1.

Support: Within its capabilities DOD is prepared to provide

all required support to CIA, State and USIA necessary to the accomplish-

ment of the objectives of Operation Mongoose.

2.:

Military Readiness: If there is a decision to use U.S. military

force, execution of our military contingency plans for Cuba will be under-

taken as rapidly as the posture of our forces will allow at the time the

decision is made.

With no prior warning and with 18 days of preparation a

coordinated airborne /amphibious assault could be executed which, it is

anticipated, would gain control of key military installations and the

principal centers of population of Cuba within I0 day and result in

minimum US and Cuban casualties. This plan provides for confronting

Cuban forces with sufficient strength to be clearly beyond Cuban capability

to resist, to enduce early capitulation of their units and to avoid needless

loss of life.

CAl

A requirement to reduce significantly the pre-assault period

would necessitate incremental commitment of US forces as they could be

assembled and employed Under this plan the time required to gain essential

US military control of Cuba could be appreciably extended. However,

reduction of US military reaction time may be of overriding importance.

In such case, air and naval forces could attack with little delay from the

time the decision is made

An air assault could be initiated within 8

hours; an airborne assault could be initiated within 5 days; and a Navy/

Marine amphibious force could be committed 3 days later with a build up

of the full scale effort to follow.

c. In concept, initial military operations commence with an

air and naval blockade, concentrated air strikes, and coordinated naval

gunfire to effect destruction of enemy airpower and to neutralize and

lestroy as much as possible of the enemy armor. artille dectinto
