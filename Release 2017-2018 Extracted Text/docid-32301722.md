advice and direction from the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta,

where he was incarcerated after having received a ten year sentence.

After the arrest of Avila the MIRR launched a campaign to obtain his

release. US President Richard M. Nixon was urged to give Avila

clemency and the MIRR instituted a program to place pressure on the

US Government in order to obtain the release of Avila. On 12/15/72 he

was released on parole. Avila criticized the FBI by stating "The.

FBI has for the last six years maintained a constant persecution

against me personally" adding "there exists an animosity against me

on the part of a few members of that Agency."

an exiled Cuban medical doctor, who was considering joining the PRP

since he was offered a position of leadership by the PRP leaders; but

Avila became dissatisfied with this organization because all it ever

did was hold meetings and spent too much money traveling and talking

instead of fighting. Avila was former head of the anti-Castro action

group known as the MIRR, who was paroled on 12/15/72, after serving

slightly more than four years of a ten-year sentence, following his

conviction in 1968 in Federal Court, Miami, on charges of extortion,

list and the death of Jose Elias De La Torriente Y Ajuria (105-148358),

Gil believed that pro-Castro elements were responsible for

Torriente's death and the list.

The only individual she could think

of with pro-Castro sympathies who might have had something to do with

Torriente's death was Orlando Bosch.

Gil that Bosch was a communist and worked for Castro.
