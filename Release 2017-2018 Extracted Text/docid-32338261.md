CONTINUANCE OF NOTE:

Supposedly,

Pino's initial reaction was favorable, but subsequenty

Pino evidently became suspicious of Cruz's documentation and drew

gun

on Cruz and

threatened to kill him it he was

not on the level.

Cruz

told informant that he was returning to Miami and Wro verified

that he had purchased return flight ticket.

Cruz's contact with Pino

and other Cuban officials was verified through WFO coverage of Cuban

Embassy,

and it appears that Cuban officials had learned that Cruz

had quit Cuban Government about a year ago and was carryingfalse

identification.

WrO has set out lead for Miami to check on local

leved with ClA concerning Cruz (without jeopardizing

since jaD is covertly supported by ClArand sincexthat Agency may Rave

or may be able to develop information Concerning Cruz's mission in

Washington.& We are holding dissemination of

information to other

agencies in abeyance pending efforts

by Miami

to further identify

Cruzdand determine if he

is engaged in a CIA operation.*
