Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means

(Explain in detail) :

Some of subject's movements can be obtained by surveillance

and informants; however, detailed information re day-to-day activities

and movements of subject, particularly information regarding subject's

membership and activities in the "Commission"

cannot be obtained through

any other sources.

12. Risks of detection involved:

Through contacts, telephone service at address will be interrupted.

Sound Agent under pretext will make necessary installation during

a sa mace

repair to restore telephone service. Technically, it has been

ascertained that there is in existence necessary wiring in the

building for installation of a 42A which will not be detected and

will take only a few minutes

for installation. This plan will be

executed when subject is not present. If during the execution of

this plan a question of security or risk arises, the installation

will not be made.

The building is three stories with apartments

on the second and thira floors.

The above-described plan at present

appears to be the only method for completing installation.

13. Probable length' of technical surveillance:

Surveillance will be continued as long as productive.

14.

Request made for technical surveillance by

any outside agency
