ol as you wit note in paragraph T of the Reference, we

asked SMABOVE to give us compiled information that they have on

various MHCHAOS targets. At the time they said that these con-

passed.

They promised, however, to furnish us the same material

in a form that could be passed®

The attached two books entitledos

"The Black Power Movement in Canada" and "Unrest in the Academic

Community (Canada)"/were recently passed to us in response to

this request.

From a cursory review of the material it appears that

some of it is already known to you.

BUTCHER, a West Indian and a member of the SGwU

Caribbean Students

Society, attended the Black University Conference

(BUC) at Howard University, Washington, on 13 to 17 November 1968

where he stated that only by working together would Black people

achieve their objective - total liberation, black nationality and

black identity.

BUTCHER was elected Chairman of the International

Black Student: Union organized at the BUC and plans were made for the

Union to operate in every university in the Western Hemisphere.

was following BUTCHEN's return to Montreal that the Black Students

Association was organized. BUTCHER was one of the key leaders

during the occupation of the Computer Centre at SGWU and was one

of those arrested during the riot.

Sidney COONTZ - Associate Professor, SFU

COONTZ, a U.S.A. citizen who was granted landed

immigrant status in Canada in 1966,

Laughlin Bernard CURLIE - Professor, SFU.

CURRIE, formerly an American citizen, was implicated as a

Communist fellow traveller in the mid-1940 espionage trials in the

United States and subsequently went to Colombia where he took out

citizenship. Following this, in May 1967, he came to Canada and

has since obtained landed immigrant status.

CURRIE was responsible

for a position at SFU and purposefully played down

Marxist leanings, claiming that HALPERIN had been a victim of cir-

cumstances.

APPENDIX 16

Kennedy Jerome FREDERICK - student, SWU

FREDERICK, a west Indian, arrived in Canada in August

1967 to attend university at SwU.

FREDERICK is a member of the

militant Negro movement at the University and advocates violence.

He is considered by some parties to be extremely dangerous and

capable of drastic actions.

He was active in organizing the

occupation of the Computer Center at SGwU and was one of those

arrested during the riot.

Maurice HALPERIN - Professor, SHU

HALPERIN was born on 3 March 1906 at Boston, Massachusetts

and entered Canada in the spring of 1468.

In late 1953 he left the

Jnited States for Mexico in order to avoid testifying before a

United States Senate internal sub-committee:

In 195%:, when the

Mexican Government began deporting United States Communists,

HALPiriN went to the Soviet Union, and became a visiting professor

at the U.s. S.r. Academy of Sciences.

He went to Cuba in Uctober

1y02 as a professor of Economy at the University of havana, where

he remained employed until coming to Canada.

He is currently

employed with the Faculty of Education, Behavioural Science

Foundation, at Simon Fraser University. As noted above, Laughlin

Bernard CURkIE lobbied very hard to have HALPERIN accepted by

Simon Fraser University. CURRIE was aware of HALPERIN's background

and "watered it down" to get him the appointment.

Of particular interest in this case is the fact that

CURRIE and HALPERIN were associated

with the same espionage group

in the United States.

His application for landed status was the

subject oi an objection by the RCMp and, as yet, no final decision

has neen made by the Minister of Immigration.

Alfred Alan HERZUG - graduate student, McGill University

HERZOG, a U.S.A. citizen

travelled to several Canadian

university campuses with Robert CRUISE, a leader of the Inter-

nationalists (pro-Chinese Communist), in their promotion of the

Canadian Student Movement.

He is a member of the Intellectual

and Patriotic workers of Quebec (les Intellectuels et Ouvriers

ratriotes du quebec - lord), was involved in the occupation of. SGu

in February 1909 and is a close associate of the leader of the

Internationalists H.S. BAINS (see

APPENDIX 14) •

of the SDU at SFU, consists of left-wing activists in this

category.

Martin Lonel, who was one of the student leaders.

during the Sfu incident, entered Canada as a British citizen in

August 1966. Dr. Thomas Burton BOTTOMORE , a leading Marxist

and author on Marxism as well as a British citizen, took up

employment at SFU in 1965 as head of the Department of Political

Science, Sociology and Anthropology (PSA).

BOTTOMORE, as head of

the PSA, was responsible for the hiring of Kathleen ABERLE, a

British

citizen, and of Thomas Harold BROSE, John William Carl

LEGGETT, Mathan POPKIN and Martin NICOLAUS, all U.S. citizens.

Although the largest concentration of foreign radicals

at slu was in the DA

other activists aid take positions in

other departments.I These included Sidney COONTZ, Michael Allar

LEBOWITZ, Paul Edward IVORY, and Maurice HALPERIN, all U.S.

citizens, and Laughlin Bernard CURRIE, a citizen of Colombia.

Mordgcai BRIEMBERG, who took over as head of the PSA

Department after BOTTOMORE tendered his resignation in 1967, has

expressed a desire to remain as Department head in order to

his hand in on the hiring.

In this regard, Gerald SPaRING IS

through BRIEMBERG, making efforts to get Malcolm SYLVERS, an American

Marxist university professor who apparently worked for

• the Communist

underground in Italy during the early 1960's, into SFU.

Professor Donald E. EPSTEIN of the Political Science

Department at the University of Waterloo, an American citizen

described as a draft dodger and an SDS member prior to his arrival

in Canada in 1967, as previously indicated, has been active in

organizing and directing students in tactics and methods by which

they could take physical possession of university buildings.

EPSTEIN, who has been active in student power activities at

Waterloo, has apparently been refused tenure at that University

and there are indications that activist students intend to challenge

the administration in this regard.

Professor Norman STRAX,

an American who was employed

as an Assistant Professor o1 Physics at the University of Nen

Brunswick, precipitated the crisis at that University.

STRAX was

instrumental in the formation and activities of the SDS branch at

chat point.

See APPENDIX 16 for further details on

specific foreigners living in Canada.

for a Democratic Society (CSDS) •
