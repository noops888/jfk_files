YURI I. NOSENKO

On 1/17/83, source was queried concerning any

knowledge he might have of the NOSENKO matter.

He advised

that "officially" the KGB never discusses defectors and

generally all one would hear would be rumor and gossip.

NOSENKO is considered a "traitor" in the eyes of

the KGB

as tar as source is awared

The source assumed that NOSENKO told western

pecial one one our the see une convento at o

following NOSENKO's defection to do a damage assessment.

is an aside, source noted that his defection would be

examined" by members of the k Directorate of the firet

Chief Directorate and by members of the 9th Department of the

S Directorate. g

Source has no knowledge concerning any connection

between the NOSENKO defection in 1964 and LEE HARVEY OSWALD's

assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963.

to give his opinion on the merits of some speculation that

NOSENKO defected under the direction of the KGB to convince

the US that the KGB had nothing to do with OSWALD's actions,

source did not believe that to be the case.

In source's

opinion, NOSENKO's defection and all the information he furnished

about the sco weuld have been too great a price to pay "to

save one man." At)

Source does not believe that the KGB would risk

attempt t

source has never heard that the KGB killed or attempted to kill

a defector.

COMMENT:

In 1969, [the ATLAST illegal was, in fact; ordered

astheten D.C. martment comes ATLAss net however,
