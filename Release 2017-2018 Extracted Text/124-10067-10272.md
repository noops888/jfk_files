Legat, Mexicò City has now alerted us of a teletype

shich was sent 1/15/78 Mfrom CIA Headquarters

concerning release under the

FOIA of documents in captioned matter.

Legat, Mexico Cit

expressed his concern over the adverse publicity likely to

result and the impact on our relations with Mexico. He

again cited the need to advise in advance the U. S. Ambassador

in Mexico City and the Legat's contacts there, which is made

difficult by the insufficient lead time, granted in this

matters By teletype to all SACs and Legats dated 1/16/78,

notification was made that the above material was to be

released 1/18/78.

The two above-cited instances point out the necessity

of prior notification and the dire consequences of failure

to notify the host government and the American Embassy concerned.

Failure to properly inform the American Ambassador in advance

places our Legat in a most embarrassing position which could

possibly be avoided.

Failure to promptly provide similar in-

formation to the Legal Attache could easily jeoparize our

entire Legal Attache operation, taking into account the

sensitivities of the host country government got U

RECOMMENDATION:

US. That in order to avoid placing our foreign operations

in jebpardy, future releases effecting our Legats be coordinated

in

advance with the Intelligence Division.
