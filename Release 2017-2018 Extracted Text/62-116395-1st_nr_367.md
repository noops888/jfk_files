On 7/1/75, the SCHAFERS advised that they had

MICHAEL EPSTEIN,

both staff members of the Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence

Activities.

It was a short interview wherein KIRBOW solicited

the general unsworn statements of the SCHAFERS regarding

allegations against the FBI of JOE BURTON. KIRBOW stated that '

he believed BURTON was a fool and was probably motivated by

general statements contradictory to BURTON's allegations,

KIRBOW said that they confirm his impression of BURTON.

SCHAFERS were important to the Committee

s inquiries in

characterizing BURTON

according to KIRbOw.

The SCHAFERS

did not go into detail regarding their radical activities

or relationship with the FBI.

KIRBOW said the SCHAFERS' statements would remain

confidential and would not be leaked to the press. KIRBOW

said he did not expect the SCHAFERS to be asked or subpoenaed

to testify openly before the full Committee.
