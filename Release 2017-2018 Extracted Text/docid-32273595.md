FArt

Oreleans

(1) Two primary reasons prompted the Committee to

investigate anti-Castro activists and organizations.

First, the Committee ascertained that as a consequence

of the failure and eventual unwillingness of the Kennedy

Administration to

liberate Cuba from Castro, these persons

and organizations. meng located primarily in the

United States,

whighly militaristic in natured

a possessed

the means, motive, and opportunity to assassinate the

President. Second, the Committee felt that Lee Harvey

Oswald's verified association with

anti-Castro

Cubans while living in New Orleans during 1963,

together with his possible contacts with other anti-

Castro

activists,

possibility

ia, further enhanced the probability of the

involvement of anti-Castro elements in the assassination.

For these reasons, the Committee thoroughly investigated

numerous anti-castro organizations and operatives

and Oswald's activita while living. in

New Orleans to

determine their connection, if any, to the

assassination.

(2) The committee initiated its investigation by

selecting the most active

anti-Castro groups and their

key leaders

from

among the more than 100 anti-Castro

organizations

in

existence in November 1963. These

groups included Alpha 66, JURE, Commandos L, the

Directorio Revolutionario Estudiantial (DRE), the Cuban

Revolutionary Council (CRC), which includes the Frente

Revolucianario Democratico (FRD), the Junta Gobierno de

Cuba in Exilo (JGCE), the 30th of November,

the

International Penetration Forces (InterPen),

Revolutionary Recovery Movement (MRR), and EIC.

the federal

and local agencies then

monitoring Cuban exile

activity. These agencies included local police departments,

the FBI, the CIA, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs (now the DEA), the Customs Service, the Immigration

and

Naturalization Service, and the Department of Defense.

(3) These groups can be described as "action groups."

These were the movements most active on both the

military and propaganda fronts, the enouge len not

only talked about

anti-Castro operations, but actually

carried

out infiltrations and raids into Cuba, conducted

Castro assassination attempts, participated in a

multiplicity of

arms dealings and possessed the most

vociferous and aggressive leaders. These were the

groups and individuals who received the crux of the

Kennedy Administration's crackdown on

anti-Castro

operations following the Cuban missile crisis. These

were

also the ones who, in the end, were the most

bitter at president Kennedy and felt the

most

THE

INGREDiENTS OF AN

ANTI-CASTRO CUBAN CONSPIRACYA

Fonzi

(9) Was the John F. Kennedy assassination a conspiracy

involving anti-Castro Cuban exiles? There were at

least two significant factors which led the committee

to consider that

question:

the Warren

commission's decision not, to further) investigate|the

issue despite the urging of staff counsels involved

and

in that area of evidences

- the

apparent fact that the anti-Castro Cuban exiles had

the means, motivation and opportunity to be involved

in the assassination.

Fustberaa

•, the area of possible Cuban exile

involvement was one in which the Warren Commission

was not provided with an adequate investigative

background. According to the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence, which looked into the sole

intent

(11) "Despite knowledge of Oswald's apparent interest

in pro-Castro and anti-Castro activities and top level

awareness of certain CIA assassination plots, the

FBI...made no special investigative effort into,

spire

questions of possible Cuban government or Cuban exile

involvement in the assassination independent of the

Oswald investigation. There is no indication that

the FBI or the CIA directed the interviewing of

Cuban sources or of sources within the Cuban exile

community. "I

(12) Nevertheless, even from the paucity of

evidence that was available to them

in 1964, two

staff

attorneys for the Warren Commission speculated

that Lee Harvey Oswald, despite his public posture

as a Castro sympathizer, was actually an agent of

anti-Castro exiles. Pressing for further investiga-

tion of that possibility, Assistant Counsels William

Colemand and W. David Slawson wrote a memorandum to

stoat,

ine

the Commission

:

(13)

The evidence here could lead to an anti-

Castro involvement in the assassiantion

on some sort of basis as this: Oswald

could have become known to the Cubans as

being strongly pro-Castro.

He made no

secret of his sympathies,

and

so the

anti-Castro Cubans must have realized

that law enforcement

authorities were

also aware of Oswald's feelings and that,

therefore, if he got into trouble, the

public would also learn of them...

Second,

someone in the

anti-Castro or-

ganization might have been keen

enough

to sense that Oswald had a penchant for

violence...On these facts,

it

is pos-

sible that some sort of deception was

used to encourage Oswald to kill the

President when he came to Dallas...

The motive of this would, of course,

be the expectation that after the Presi-

dent was killed Oswald would be caught

or at least his identity ascertained,

the law enforcement authorities and the

public would then blame the assassina-

tion on the Castro government and a

call for its forceful overthrow would

be irresistible...

(15) If it can be said to have a

beginning, the

anti-Castro Cuban exile movement was seeded in the

early morning hours of New Year's Day, 1959, when a

DC-4 lifted from the fog-shrouded Camp Columbia air-

field in Havana.

down from the mountains. When dawn came, the bells

tolled in Havana and, 600 miles away, Fidel Castro Ruz

began his triumphal march to the capital. $

For

seven days Castro and his 26th of July Movement rebels

moved down Cuba's Central Highway while thousands

cheered and threw flowers in their path 6

Castro

finally arrived in Havana on January 8th and character-

istically gave a speech. Clad in his green fatigue

uniform while three white doves, which someone had

dramatically released, circled above him, Castro

coldly proclaimed: "There is no longer an enemy!"

16) He was wrong, of course, and knew it. A

hard core of Batistianos had fled the country early,

many long before their leader, and

were already

con-

cocting counter-revolutionary plots from their

refuges in the United States, the Dominican Republic

and elsewhere, &

11) And it was not very long after Castro took

power that a sense of betrayal began to grow among

those who had once been his strongest supporters.?

As each day went by it became more apparent that

Castro's Revolution was, as one chronicler noted,

"leading inexorably toward an institutionalized

dictatorship in which individuals were contemptuously

shorn of their rights and dissenters were met with

charges of treasonable conduct, counter-revolutionary

activity or worse. "10 Then too, there was a large

number of public executions. Within two weeks of

his reign, Castro shot 150 ex-Batista officials.l1

Within three months, there were at least 506 execu-

12

tions.

18) The disillusionnent for many Cubans deepened

when it became obvious that the form of Castro's

rule was turning toward Communism and that Castro's

attitude toward the United States was engendering

hostile relationship. The publishing

of Castro's

Agrarian

Reform Law in May, 1959, was a significant

sign. 13

It was

far more radical than had been ex-

pected and was obviously designed to strip both

Cuban and American-owned sugar firms of their im-

mensely valuable cane lands.

A few weeks later

the Chief of Castro's Air Force, Major Pedro Diaz-

Lanz, resigned, charging "...there was Communist in-

fluence in the armed forces and Government. ,I5

Then,

when Castro's own hand-picked President, Manuel

Urrutia, announced at a press conference that he

rejected the support of the Communists and said "I

believe that any real Cuban revolutionary should

reject it openly," Castro immediately forced him to

resign and accused him of actions "bordering on

treason. "16

(19) And so, after the broken pledges of free

elections and a free press, the mass trials and

executions, the assumption of unlimited power and

the bellicose threats against the United States, it

slowly began to dawn on many Cubans

that Fidel

Castro was not the political savior they

had ex-

17 M

pected. (20) Then, on October 19, 1959, there occurred

an incident which precipitated the formation of the

first organized anti-Castro opposition within Cuba.

Major Huber Matos, one of Castro's highest-ranking

officers and considered by most Cubans te be one of

the key heroes of the Revolution, resigned from the

Army in protest against the increasing favoritism

18

shown to known Communists.

The next day Matos was

arrested, charged with treason, subsequently tried

and

sentenced to twenty years

in

prison. Shortly

afterwards, Castro himself called a secret meeting

of the National Agrarian Reform Institute managers

at which he outlined a plan to communize Cuba within

19

three years.

There the suspicions of Dr. Manuel

Artime, the manager in Oriente Province, were con-

firmed. "I realized," Artime later said, "that I

was a democratic infiltrator in a Communist govern-

ment. "20

HH 53080

DooId:32273595 Page 16

## Page 17

(21) Artime returned to Oriente and began of-

ganizing

students and peasants to fight against

Castro and Communism. By early November each pro-

vince in Cuba had an element of Artime's new under-

ground movement. It was called the Movimiento de

Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR). It was the first

anti-Castro action group originating from within

Castro's own ranks.

(22) By the summer of 1960, it had become ob-

vious both within and outside of Cuba that the founda-

tion for an eventual confrontation between Castro and

anti-Castro forces had been laid. The Eisenhower

Administration had cancelled the Cuban sugar quota.

22

Mikoyan had visited Havana and Raul Castro had gone

to Moscow, 23 Ernesto "Che" Guevara had proclaimed

publicly that the Revolution was on the road

set by

Marx, and Allen Dulles of the Central Intelligence

Agency

had said in a speech that Communism had per-

verted Castro's revolution.

24

1a3 By then,, Castro

had seized more than $700 million in U. S. property

within Cuba. 25

(23) 0n March 17, 1960, President Eisenhower

authorized the CIA to organize, train, and equip Cuban

refugees as

a guerilla force to overthrow Castro.

26

## Page 18

Soon it became common knowledge within Cuba that a

liberation army was being formed and that a political

structure in exile had been created. 27

As the

flight from Cuba increased in size and fervor, the

exile community in the United States grew in spirit

and confidence. One historian captured the special

characteristics of the new arrivals:

They were new types of refugees.

Instead

of a home, they were seeking temporary

asylum.

They found it along the sandy

beaches and cursing coastline of Florida.

They arrived by the thousands, in small

fishing

boats, in planes, chartered or

stolen, and crowded into Miami.

Along

the boulevards, under the palms, and in

hotel lobbies,

they gathered and plotted

their counter-revolution.

Miami began

to take on

the air of a Cuban city.

Even its voice was changing.

Stores and

cafes began advertising

in

Spanish and

English... Everyone talked of home only

one hundred miles away.

And everyone

talked about the great liberation army

where far away. 2ghe secret camps some-

24) By April, 1961, the more than 100,000 Cubans

who had fled Castro's Revolution lived in anticipation

of its overthrow.

They had been buoyed in that hope

by public pronouncements of support from the United

States Government.

In his State of the Union address,

President Kennedy had spoken of "the Communist base

established 90 miles from the United States," and

said that "... Communist domination in this hemi-

sphere can never be negotiated. i29

In addition, the

Cuban exiles had been organized, directed and almost

totally funded by agencies of the U. S. Government,

principally the CIA. 30

(25) From an historical perspective, in light of

its later radical change, the attitude of the Cuban

exiles toward the U. S. Government prior to the Bay

of Pigs is especially significant. Author Haynes

Johnson who, in writing a history of the invasion,

collaborated with the top Cuban leaders, including

Brigade civilian chief Manuel Artime, described that

attitude in detail:

From the beginning, the Cuban counter-

revolutionists viewed their new American

friends with blind trust.

of the Cubans involved, believed so much

in the Americans -- or wanted so desper-

ately to believe -- that they never ques-

tioned what was happening or expressed

doubts about the plans.

it, they agree now that their na veck was

partly genuine and partly reluctance

to

turn down any offer of help in liberat-

ing their country.

In fact, they had

little choice; there was no other place

to turn.

Some, of course, were driven

by other motives: political power and

personal ambition

were involved.

Even

DocId: 32273595

more

important was the traditional Cuban

attitude

toward America and Americans.

To Cubans the United States was more than

the colossus of the North, for the two

countries

were bound closely by attitudes,

by history, by geography and by economics.

The United States was great

and powerful,

the master not only of the hemisphere but

perhaps of the world, and it was Cuba's

friend. One really didn't question such

a belied the mysterious,

It was a fact; everyone knew

anonymous,

ubiquitous American agents who dealt with

the cubans managed to strengthen that

oellet.

(26) This "blind trust" by the Cuban exiles in

the U. S. Government prior to the Bay of Pigs was

specifically noted by the military commander of the

2506 Brigade, José (Pepe) Pérez San Roman:

"Most

of the Cubans were there," he said, "because they

knew the whole operation was going to be conducted by

the Americans, not by me or anyone else. They did

not trust me or anyone else. They just trusted the

Americans. So they were going to fight because the

United States was backing them. "32

27) The debacle at the Bay of Pigs was not only

a military tragedy for the anti-Castro Cuban exiles

but also a painful shattering of their confidence in

the U. S. Government. The exile

leaders claimed that

the failure of the invasion was

a result of the lack

53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 20

## Page 21

V - 11

Goby

of promised air support, and for that they directly

lamed President Kennedy. 33

Particularly galling

to them was Kennedy's public declaration to Soviet

Premier Khrushchev at the height of the invasion,

when the Brigade was being slaughtered in the swamps

of Bahia de Cochinos: "...I repeat now that the

United States intends no armed

intervention in

Cuba. "34

28) Even those exile leaders who were willing

to rationalize the extent of Kennedy's responsibility

were dissuaded when Kennedy himself admitted the

blame. Cuban Revolutionary Council leader Manuel

antonio do varona, an hisicestimony bazare the con-

mittee, told of the President gathering the Council

members together at the White House when it became

clear that the invasion was a disaster.

I, verona se-

called: "We were not charging Mr. Kennedy with any-

thing; we just wanted to clarify. We knew that he

didn't have any direct knowledge of the problem, and

we knew that he was not in charge of the military

effects directly. Nevertheless, President Kennedy,

to finish the talks, told us he was the one -- the

only one responsible. "35

A few days after that

HH

## Page 22

V - 12

meeting, the White House issued a public statement

declaring that President Kennedy assumed "sole re-

sponsibility" for the U. S. role in the action

36

against Cuba.

(29) The acceptance of responsibility did not

cut the bitter disappointment the Cuban exiles felt

toward the U. S. Government and

President Kennedy.

Much later, captured and imprisoned by Castro, Brigade

Commander San Roman revealed the depth of his re-

action at the failure of the invasion: "I hated

the United States," he said, "and I felt that I had

been betrayed. Every day it became worse and then I

was getting madder and madder and I wanted to get

a rifle and come and fight against the U. s. "37

(38) Prominent Cuban attorney Mario Lazo wrote

a book caustically titled Dagger In the Heart.

38

"The Bay of. Pigs defeat was wholly self-inflicted

in Washington," Lazo wrote!

Kennedy told the truth when he publicly

accepted responsibility...The heroism

of the beleaguered Cuban Brigade had

been rewarded by betrayal,

defeat,

death

for many

of them, long and cruel im-

prisonment for

the rest.

The Cuban

people and the Latin American nations,

bound to Cuba by thousands of subtle ties

of race and culture, were left with

feelings of astonishment and disillusion-

ment, and in many cases despair.

They

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 22

## Page 23

V - 13

had always admired the United States as

strong, rich, generous -- but where

was its sense of honor and the capacity:

of its leaders?

The mistake of the Cuban fighters

for liberation was that they thought

too highly of the United States.

They

believed

to the end that it wogld not

let them down. But it did...

(31) President Kennedy was well aware of the

bitter legacy left him by the Bay of Pigs debacle.

It is not now possible to document the changes in

Kennedy's personal attitude brought about by the

military defeat, but the firming of U. S. policy

toward Cuba and the massive infusion of u. s. aid

by TAyloR BRANch

to clandestine anti-Castro operations in the wake

and George Crile

880 in

Of the Bay of Pigs WAs as

4 editorially characterized Harper

magazine

as "the Kennedy vendetta. "40

(32) What can be documented is the pattern of

u. S. policy between the period of the Bay of Pigs

failure in April, 1961 and the Cuban missile crisis

in October, 1962. That pattern, replete with both

overt and covert maneuvers, had a significant effect

on the re-shaping of Cuban exile attitudes and, when

could

it was abruptly reversed, mog have provided the

motivation for involvement in the assassination of

President Kennedy.

(33) In retrospect, the period between the Bay

of Pigs and the Cuban missile crisis can be considered

the high water mark of anti-castro activity, almost

every manifestation of the U. S. policy providing a

reassurance of support of the Cuban exile cause.. As

a matter of fact, only a few days after the Bay of

Pigs invasion, President Kennedy delivered a particu-

larly hard-line address before the American Society

of Newspaper Editors on the implications of Communism

in Cuba. "Cuba must not be abandoned to the Com-

munists," he declared. In appealing for support from

Latin America, he indicated that the United States

would expext more from the nations of the hemisphere

with regard to Cuba and asserted that the United

States would not allow the doctrine of non-interven-

tion to hinder its policy. Said Kennedy, "...our

restraint is not inexhaustible," and spoke of Cuba

in the context of the "new and

deeper struggle. "41

(34) when Castro, in a May Day speech, declared

Cuba to be a socialist nation, the State Department

retorted that Cuba was a full-fledged member of the

42

Communist bloc.

(35) Another U. S. response was the establishment

of the Alliance for Progress, after years of relatively

little attention to Latin America's economic and

social needs. 43

President Kennedy gave the Alliance

memoRable

concept a fasts launching in a speech in March,

1961 when he called for vigorous promotion of

social and economic development in Latin America

through democratic means and, at the same time,

pledged substantial financial

and political support. 44

36) While the campaign to broaden its Cuban

policy base was being pursued, the United States

was

proceeding on another course. In one of

the first unilateral efforts to isolate Cuba from

its allies, the United States in September, 1961 an-

nounced it would stop assistance to any country that

assisted Cuba: In December, Kennedy extended the

denial of Cuba's sugar quota through the first half

45

of 1962.

(37) Meanwhile, the secret policy aimed at removing

Castro through assassination continued as FBI chief

J. Edgar Hoover informed Attorney General Robert

Kennedy in May that the CIA had used the Mafia in

"clandestine efforts" against Castro. 46

In that month,

poison pills to be used in a plot to kill Castro were

47

passed to a Cuban exile in Miami by a Mafia figure.

In November, 1961, the CIA initiated Operation

MONGOOSE, designed to enlist 2000 Cuban exiles and

48

dissidents inside Cuba to overthrow Castro.

(38) apptough the bitter aftertaste of the Bay

of Pigs invasion lingered in the Cuban exile com-

munity, those who remained active in the fight

against Castro came to realize that these subsequent

actions of the Kennedy Administration were

manifesta-

tions of its determination to reverse the defeat.

What Kennedy has euphemistically termed "a

new and

deeper struggle" (supra) became, in actuality, a

secret war:

...the new President apparently

perceived the defeat as an

affront to his

pride.

Within a matter of weeks he com-

mitted the United States

to a secret war

against Cuba that eventually required the

services of several thousand men and cost

as much as $100 million a year... Kennedy

entrusted its direction to the CIA,

...conducted an operation that could be

described either as

or a small crusade. " large-scale vendetta

(39)

The fact that the agency of the U. S. Govern-

ment the anti-Castro exiles had most dealt with and

relied on prior to the Bay of Pigs became, after the

invasion

failure, the controlling force of the "secret

war" was

another indication to the Cuban exiles that

the Kennedy Administration was, indeed, still

sincere about overthrowing Castro.

Within a year of the Bay of Pigs, the CIA

curiously and inexplicably began to grow,

to branch out, to gather more and more

responsibility for the'Cuban problem'.

HH 53080 DocId:32273595 Page 26

The Company was given authority to help

monitor Cuba's wireless traffic; to ob-

serve its weather; to follow the Castro

government's purchases

abroad and its

currency transactions; to move extra-

ordinary numbers of clandestine field

operatives in and out of Cuba; to ac-

quire

a support fleet of ships and air-

craft in order to facilitate these

secret agent movements; to advise, train,

and help reorganize the police and

security establishments of Latin

countries which felt threatened by Castro

guerrilla politics; to take a hand in U-2

overflights and sea-air ELINT (Electronic

Intelligence) operations aimed at tracing

Cuban coastal-defense communications on

special devices;

to pump...vast sums into

political operations thgyght to be helpful

in containing Castro...

(48) The nerve center of the United states'

"new and deeper struggle" against Castro was estab-

lished in the heartland of exile activity, Miami.

There, on a secluded, heavily-wooded 1571-acre tract

that was part of the University of Miami's

South

Campus, the CIA set up

a front operation, an elec-

tronics firm called Zenith Technological Services. 51

Its code name was JM/WAVE and it soon became the

largest CIA installation anywhere in the world

outside of its headguarters in Langley, Virginia. 52

41) The IM/WAVE station had, at the height of

its activities in 1962, a staff of more than 300

Americans, mostly case officers. 53

Each case officer

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 27

---

## Page 28

V - 18

employed from four to ten Cuban "principal agents"

who, in turn, would each be responsible for between

10

and

30 regular agents. 54

In addition, the CIA

set up 54 front jarporations -- boat shops, real estate

firms, detective agencies, travel companies, gun

shops -- to provide ostensible employment for the

case officers and agents operating outside of JM/WAVE

headquarters. 55

It also maintained hundreds of pieces

of real estate, from small apartments to palatial

homes, as "safe houses" in which to hold secret

56

meetings.

As a result of its JM/WAVE oepration,

the CIA became amonge Florida's largest employers, 57

(42) It was the IM/WAVE station, through its case

offieers, which monitored, more or less controtted,

and in most cases funded the anti-Castro groups.

58

It was responsible for the great upsurge in anti-.

Castro activity and the lifted spirits of the Cuban

exiles as American arms and weapons flowed freely

through the training camps and guerrilla bases

59

spotted around South Florida.

Anti-Castro raiding

parties that left from small secret islands in the

Florida Reys were given the "green light" by agents

of the IM/WAVE station. 60 The result of it all was

that there grew in the Cuban exile community a re-

newed confidence in the U. S. Government's sincerity

and loyalty to its cause.

HH 53080

(43) Then came the Cuban missile crisis. The

more fervent Cuban exiles were initially elated by

the possibility that the crisis might provoke a

final showdown with Castro. 61

For several months

prior there was

increasing pressure on President

Kennedy to take strong measures against the build-

up of the Soviet presence in Cuba, which was becoming

daily more blatant. In a report issued at the end

of March, 1962 the State Department said that Cuba

had received from the Soviet Union $100 million in

military aid for the training of Cuban

pilots in

Czechoslovakia and that the Soviet Union also had

provided

from 50 to 75 MIG fighters as well as tons

of modern weapons for Cuba's ground forces.

62

For-

tifying the Cuban exile's hope for action was the

fact that the increasing amounts of Soviet weapons

moving

into Cuba became the dominant issue in the

news in the succeeding months, leading to Congres-

sional calls for action and a series of hard-line

63

responses

from President Kennedy.

In September,

Kennedy declared

that the United States would use

"whatever

means may

be necessary" to prevent Cuba

from exporting "its aggressive purposes by force

or threat of force" against "any part of the

western Hemisphere. "64

HH 53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 29

## Page 30

V = 20

44) The fervent hope of the Cuban exiles -

that the Cuban missile crisis would ultimately result

in the United States smashing the Castro regime --

was shattered by the manner in which President

Kennedy resolved the crisis. Cuba itself was rele-

gated to a minor role as tough negotiations took

place between the United States and the Soviet Union,

specifically through communication between

President

Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev.

The crisis ended

"when President Kennedy announced

that all IL-28 bombers were being withdrawn by the

Soviets and progress was being made on the withdrawal

of offensive missiles and other weapons from Cuba.

In return, Kennedy gave the Soviets and the Cubans a

66

"no invasion" pledge.

(45) If Kennedy's actions at the Bay of Pigs

first raised doubts

in the minds of the Cuban

exiles

about the President's sincerity

and determination to

biing about the fall of Castro, his handling of the

missile crisis confirmed those doubts. Kennedy's

agreement with Khrushchev was termed "a violation"

of the pledge he had made three days after the Bay

of Pigs invasion that the United States would never

abandon. Cuba to Communism.

Wrote one prominent

exile: "For the

friendly Cuban people, allies of

the United States, and for hundreds of thousands of

V - 21

exiles eager to stake their lives to liberate their

native land, it was a soul-shattering blow. "68

(46) The bitterness of the anti-castro exiles

was exacerbated by the actions the United States

Government took to implement the President's "no

invasion" pledge. Suddenly there was a crackdown

on the very training camps and guerrilla bases which

had been originally established and funded by the

United States and the exile raids which once had

the Government's "green light" were now promptly

disavowed and condemned.

(47) on March 31, 1963 a group of anti-castro

raiders were arrested by British police at a train-

ing site in the Bahamas. 69 The U. S. State Depart-

ment admitted it had given the British the informa-

tion about the existence of the camp.?0

That same

night another exile raiding boat was seized in

Miami harbor.71 On April 3ra, the Soviet Union

charged that the United States "encourages and

bears full responsibility" for two recent attacks

on Soviet ships in Cuban ports by anti-Castro exile

commandos.?2

The United States responded that it

was "taking

every

step necessary

to insure

that

such attacks are not launched, manned

or. equipped

from U. S. territory. "73 On April 5th, the Coast

Guard announced it was throwing more planes, ships

and men into its effort to police the straits of

Florida against anti-Castro raiders.

As a result

of the crackdown, Cuban exile sources declared that

their movement to rid their homeland of Communism

had been dealt "'a crippling blow"

and that they had

lost a vital supply link with anti-Castro fighters

inside Cuba.

48) There were numerous other indications of

the U. S. crackown on anti-Castro activity following

the missile crisis. The Customs Service raided what

had long been a secret training camp in the Florida

Keys and arrested the anti-Castro force in training

there.75

The FBI seized a major cache of explosives

at an anti-Castro camp in Louisiana.

Just weeks

later, the U. S. Coast Guard cooperated with the

British Navy which had captured another group of

Cuban exiles in the Bahamas."

In September, the

Federal Aviation Administration issued "strong

warnings" to six American civilian pilots who had

78

been flying raids over Cuba.

Shortly afterwards,

the Secret Service arrested a prominent exile leader

for conspiring to counterfeit Cuban currency

destined

79

for rebel forces inside Cuba.

In october,

the

Coast Guard seized four exile ships and arrested

22

HH 53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 32

## Page 33

V - 23

anti-Castro raiders who claimed they were moving

their operations out of the U. S.

(49)

The feeling of betrayal by the Cuban exiles

was given reinforcement by prominent sympathizers

outside their community, as well

as by Kennedy's

political opponents. Captain Eddie Rickenbacker,

chairman of the Committee for the Monroe Doctrine,

asserted: "The Kennedy Administration has committed

the final betrayal of Cuban hopes for freedom by its

order to block the activities of exiled Cuban freedom

fighters to liberate their nation from Communism. "81

Senator Barry Goldwater accused Kennedy of "doing

everything in his power" to keep the flag of Cuban

exiles "from ever flying over Cuba again. "82

Richard

Nixon urged the end of what he called the "quarantine"

of Cuban exiles.

(50)

Of course, the most strident reactions came

from within the anti-Castro community itself. Follow-

ing the U. S. Government's notification that it woula

discontinue its subsidy to the Cuban Revolutionary

Council, its president, José Miró Cardona, announced

his resignation from the Council in protest against

u. s. policy.

The Cuban exile leader

accused

President Kennedy of "breaking promises and agreempêts"

85

to support another invasion of Cuba.

Cardona

said the change in American policy reflected the

fact that Kennedy had become "the victim of a master

play by the Russians. "86

(51) The extent of the deterioration of relation-

ships between the Cuban exiles and the Kennedy Admin-

istration is indicated in the State Department's

reply to Cadfona's charges. It labeled them "a

gross distortion of recent history. "87

(52) Against the pattern of United states crack-

down on Cuban exile activity during this period,

however, emerges a counter-grain of incidents which

may have some bearing on an examination of the

Kennedy assassination. These incidents involve some

very significant Cuban exile raids and anti-Castro

operations which took place, despite the crackdown,

between the time of the missile crisis and the assas-

sination of the President. In fact, in the midst

of the missile crisis, one of the most active Cuban

groups, Alpha 66, announced that it made a successful

raid on the Cuban port city of Isabela de Sagua,

killing about twenty defenders, including Russians.

88

On October 15th, the same group sunk a Cuban patrol

89

boat.

On October 31st, the day after the blockade

90

was lifted,

it struck again.

Immediately after

the crisis ended in November, a spokesman for the

HH 53080 DocId:32273595 Page 34

## Page 35

V - 25

group pledged new raids. 91

(53) During this period, e

a. other anti-Castro

atto

groups remained active. In April, a group calling

itself the Cuban Freedom Fighters reported bombing

92

an oil refinery outside Havana.

In May, the Cuban

government confirmed that anti-Castro rebels had

carried out

a "pirate" raid on a militia camp near

Havana despite U. S. promises "to take measures to

prevent such attacks. "93

Later that month, the anti-

Castro Internal Front of Revolutionary Unity reported

it had formed a military junta in Cuba to serve as

"provisional government of Cuba in arms." Shortly

afterwards, a group of returning Cuban exile raiders

claimed they had blown up a Cuban refinery, sank a

gunboat and killed "many" of Castro's soldiers.

94

It

is not known exactly how many incidents took place

during this period, but in April of 1963 one anti-

Castro fighter asserted that, by then, the United

States Government knew of eleven raids on Cuba since

the missile crisis and did nothing.

(54)

One analyst, reviewing that period of U. s.-

Cuban relations, noted: "The U. S. Government's

policy

toward the exiles was equivocal and inconsis-

96

tent.

(55) It cannot be determined to what extent, if ,

any, the military activities of the anti-Castro

exile groups were sanctioned of supported by the

oe botte.

Kennedy Administration for by the CIAM At a

press conference in May, 1963, in response to a

question as to whether or not the U. s. Was giving

aid to exiles, President Kennedy was evasive: "We

may well be...well, none that I am familiar with...

I don't think as of today that we are. "97

And it

is known that by June, 1963, the CIA was supporting

at least one Cuban exile group, a tuRE, under

what was termed an "autonymous operations" concept. 98

(56) In retrospect, this much is clear: With of

without U. S. Government support and whether or not

in blatant defiance of Kennedy Administration policy,

there were a number of anti-Castro action groups

which were determined to continue -- and, in fact,

did continue -- their operations. The resignation

of Miró Cardona actually split the Cuban Revolution-

ary Council down the middle and precipitated a bitter

99

dispute among the exile factions.

The more moderate

contended that without U. S. support there was

little hope of ousting Castro and that the exiles

should concentrate their efforts in mounting political

V - 27

pressure to reverse Washington's shift in policy. 100

Other exile groups announced their determination to

continue the war against Castro and, if necessary,

to violently resist curtailment of their paramilitary

activities in the kennedy Administration. 101 In

New. Orleans, for instance, Carlos Bringuier, the

local leader of the Cuban

Student Directorate (DRE)

who, coincidentally, would later have a contact with

Lee Harvey Oswald, proclaimed, in the wake of the

Miro Cardona resignation, that his group "would con-

tinue efforts to liberate Cuba despite action by the

U.S. to stop raids originating from U. S. soil. soil."102

(57)

It's peshape sigmitreant yo nute that Fhe

seeds of defiance of the Kennedy Administration may

have been planted with the exiles

even

prior

to the

Bay

of Pigs

invasion. In his history of the invasion,

Haynes Johnson revealed that shortly

before the

invasion, "Frank Bender," the CIA director of the

invasion preparations, assembled the exile leaders

together at the CIA's Guatemala training camp:

It was now early in April and Artime was

the camp as the civilian representative

of the Revolutionary Council.

vasion, and Frank might be ordered to

stop it.

If he received such an order,

he said he would secretly inform Pepe

as if you were putting

advisors, in prison, and you go

ahead with the program as we have talked

about it, and we will give you the whole

plan,

even if we are your prisoners.'

Frank then laughed and said: 'In the end

we will win.'

(58)

That, then, is the context in which the

Committee approached the question of whether or not

the John F. Kennedy assassiantion was a conspiracy

involving anti-Castro Cuban exiles. Also kept in

mind was the testimony of the CIA's chief of

its

Miami JM/WAVE station in 1963, who noted: "...'as-

sassination' was part of the ambience of that time... "104

(59) In this section is detailed the result of

the Committee's examination of the most active anti-

Castro exile groups and their key leaders. These

groups were specifically selected from the more than

100 exile organizations in existence at the time of

the Kennedy assassiantion for

Their selection was

the result of both independent field investigation

by the Committee and the Committee's examination of

the files and records maintained by those federal

and local

agencies

monitoring Cuban exile activity

at the time.

These agencies included local police

departments, the

FBI, the CIA, the Bureau of Narcotics

and Dangerous Drugs (now the DEA, the Customs

Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service

and the Department of Defense.

(60) The groups selected can be termed the

"action groups." These were the ones most active

on both the military and propaganda fronts, the ones

which not only talked about anti-Castro operations,

but actually planned and carried out infiltrations

and raids into Cuba, conducted Castro assassination

attempts, were involved in

a multi@plicity of arms

dealings and had the most vociferous and aggressive

leaders. These were also the groups and individuals

who took the brunt of the kennedy Administration's

crackdown on anti-Castro operations when it came

after the Cuban missile crisis.

These were the ones:

who, in the end, were most bitter at President

FiNALly,

Kennedy, the ones

who felt the most betrayed. UnaS

these were the groups and

individuals who had the

means and motivation to be involved in the assassina-

tion of the President.

dence that any anti-Castro Cuban group or

individual

was involved in Kennedy's assassination.

The Odio Incident

(62)

Within the pastier aft question of a possible

anti-Castro Cuban involvement in the Kennedy assassination,

the Committee examined one incident which, over the years,

has particularly intrigued critics of the Warren Commission's

investigation. It has become known as "the Odio incident,"

the principal person

involved being a young Cuban

exile

named Silvia Odio.

(63) Here, in part, is how the warren Commission detailea

the

incident and its conclusions in its final Report:

The Commission investigated (Mrs. Odio's) statements

in connection with its consideration of the testimony of

several witnesses suggesting that Oswald may have been

seen in the company of unidentified persons of

Cuban or

Mexican background. Mrs. Odio was born in Havana in

A537, and remained in Cuba until 1960; it appears that

*both of her parents are political prisoners of the

Castro regime. Mrs. Odio is a member of the Cuban

Revolutionary Junta (JURE), an anti-Castro organization.

She testified that late in September 1963, three men

came to her apartment in Dallas and asked her to help

them prepare

a letter soliciting funds for JURE activities.

She claimed that the men, who exhibited personal familiarity

with her imprisoned father, asked her if she were "working

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 41

---

## Page 42

sive

in the underground," and she replied that

she was

not. She

testified that two of the men appeared to be Cubans,

although they also had

some characteristics that she

associated with Mexicans. Those two men did not

state their full names, but identified themselves

only by their fictitious underground "war names."

Mrs. Odio remembered the name of one of the Cubans

as "Leopoldo." The third man, an American, allegedly

was introduced to Mrs. Odio as "Leon Oswald,"

and

she

was told that he was very much

interested in the Cuban

cause. Mrs. Odio said that the men told her that they

had

just come from New Orleans and that they were then

about to leave on a trip. Mrs. Odio testified that the

next day Leopoldo called her on the telephone and

told her that it was his idea to introduce the American

into the underground "because

he is great, he is kind

of nuts." Leopoldo also said that the American had been

in the Marine Corps and was

an

excellent

shot, and

that

the American said the Cubans "don't have any guts***because

President Kennedy should have been

assassinated after

the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that,

because he was the one that was holding the freedom

of Cuba actually."

Although Mrs. Odio suggested

doubts that the men

were in fact members of JURE, she was certain that

the American who was introduced to her as Leon Oswald

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 42

---

## Page 43

- Odio

was Lee Harvey Oswald. Her sister, who was in the apartment at

the time of the visit by the three men, and

who stated

that she saw them briefly in the hallway when answering

the door, also believed that the American was Lee Harvey

Oswald. By referring to the date on which she moved from

her former apartment, October 1, 1963, Mrs. Odio fixed

the date of the alleged visit on the Thursday or Friday

immediately preceding that date, i.e., September 26 or

27.

She was positive that the visit occurred

prior

to October 1.

During

the course of its investigation, however,

the Commission concluded that Oswald could not have been

in Dallas on the evening of either September 26 or 27, 1963.

It also developed

considerable evidence that he was not

in Dallas at any time between the beginning of September

and October 3, 1963....

In spite of the fact that it appeared almost certain

that Oswald could not have been

in Dallas

at the

time Mrs. Odio thought he was, the Commission requested

the FBI to conduct further investigation to determine

the validity of Mrs. Odio's testimony. The Commission

considered the problems raised by that testimony

as important in view of the possibility it raised that

Oswald may have had companions on his trip to Mexico.

The Commission specifically requested the FBI to attempt

to locate and identify the two men who Mrs. Odio stated

HH 53080

DocId:32273595 Page 43

## Page 44

- Odio

with

were with the man she thought was Oswald....

On September 16, 1964, the FBI located Loran

Eugene Hall in Johnsandale, Calif. Hall has been

identified as a participant in numerous anti-Castro

activities. He told the FBI that in September of 1963

he was in Dallas, soliciting aid in connection with

anti-Castro activities. He said he had visited Mrs.

0d10. He was accompanied by Lawrence Howard, a Mexican-

American

from

East Los Angeles and one William Seymour

from Arizona.

He stated that Seymour

is similar in

appearance to Lee Harvey Oswald; he speaks only a

few words of Spanish, as Mrs. Odio had testified one

of the men who visited her did. While the FBI had not

yet completed its investigation into this matter at the

time the report went to press, the Commission has

concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald

was not at Mrs. odio's

apartment in

(1)

September of 1963.

(69)

The unequivocality of the Warren Commission's

conclusions. was.not supported by the evidence. The Commission

had based its definite conclusion on two points: One was

the "considerable" evidence that Oswald could not have been

in Dallas on the evening Mrs. Odio alleges she saw him; (2)

HH 53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 44

---

## Page 45

5 = Odio

Siste

the other was the FBI's report of Loran Eugene Hall's

speculation that odio misidentified his companion, William

Seymour, as Lee Harvey Oswald. (3)

(70) Although the warren Commission Report states that

odio "fixed" the date of the alleged Oswald visit on

September 26 or September 27, she actually

told the FBI

that she was not at all positive about the exact date. (4)

Shersaid it might have been as early as September 25. (5)

(7/a) The warren Commission asserted that Oswald left

New Orleans by bus for Houston, on his way to Mexico, on

September 25. (6) Yet there was no documentary evidence

to: substantiatenthat, and neither the bus driver nor any

passenger could recall seeing Oswald on that bus. (7)

In

fact, Warren Commission General Counsel J. Lee Rankin

asked the FBI to investigate the possibility that Oswald

left New Orleans on September 24, 18) when a neighbor saw

him leaving his apartment carrying two suitcases.

(9)

Rankin pointed out

in his letter to J. Edgar Hoover that

"Marina Oswald told the Commission that her husband told

her he intended to leave New Orleans the very next day

following her departure on September 23, 1963. She has

also indicated that he told her an unemployment check

would be forwarded to Mrs. Ruh Paine's address in Irving

from

his post office

box in New Orleans....

It also seems

impos-

sible to us that Oswald would have gone

all

the way back to the

Winn-Dixie store at 4303 Magazine Street to cash

the

unemployment

check which he supposedly picked up at the Lafayette Branch of

the Post Officeg when he could have cashed it at Martin's Restau-

rant, where he had previously cashed many of his Reily checks

and

one unemployment check. That is particularly true if he received

the check on September 25, 1963, as previously

thought, and had

left his apartment with his suitcases the evening before. "10l

(7/b) The FBI never came up with any evidence which resolved

the questions raised in Rankin's request.

In sum, the Warren Com-

that

mission developed no hard evidence which could substantiate the

Odio said she saw him.

(71e) Although the Warren Commission

stated that the FBI had

not yet completed its investigation at the time its

report went

to press, I/ it was only two days after its September 16, 1964,

interview of Loran Eugene Hall that the FBI interviewed William

seymour, who denied he ever had any contact with

silvia Odio and

that he had

been in Dallas with Hall in September, 1963.12/ The

FBI subsequently.confirmed the fact that Seymour was working in

Florida during September, 1963.131

September 23, 1964, the FBI interviewed Loran Hall's

other associate, Lawrence Howara. (14)

Howard also denied

he had ever contacted silvia odio. (15) The FBI then

went back

and re-interviewed Hall who then said that he

had been accompanied on his

trip to Dallas not by

Seymour but by a Cuban friend he knew as "Wahito" and

that he no longer recalled any contact with odio. (16)

The FBI determined that "Wahito" was Celio Sergio Castro (17)

who, when interviewed, said he had never heard of or met

silvia odio. (18) on October 1, 1964, the FBI showed

Silvia Odio photographs of Loran Hall, William Seymour,

Lawrence Howard

and Celio Sergio Castro. (19)

She examined

the photographs and said that none of the individuals

were identical to any of the three men who had come to

her apartment door in Dallas. (20)

(72) In view of the prematurity of the warren Conmission's

conclusion based on the impeached Loran Hall allegation

and the unresolved question of Oswald's whereabouts at the

time; the Committee considered the odio incident one of

the lingering enigmas in the original assassination investi-

gation. Unfortunately, the nature of the incident makes

it, from

an

investigative standpoint, particularly suscept-

ible to the erosive effects of time.

The canvassing, for

instance, of both pro-Castro and anti-Castro groups in

Dallas, New Orleans and Miami in search of descriptive

fruitful at the time; today it would be inappropriate.

construction of a compostie sketch of the individuals when

their features were still fresh in odio's memory might have

provided productive evidence 15 years glo, today it would be

of questionable value considering the natural adulteration of

recall over that period of time. A search for the car whoe

the men were driving might have been very productive at the

time; today it would be useless. The Committee was therefore

handicapped by the limitations of the initial investigation

and the paucity of evidence developed. The valid investigative

approaches remaining were distressingly limited. Nevertheless,

because of the potential significance of the Odio incident

to a possible conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination, the

Committee decided that, in addition to pursuing any substantive

leads it possibly could, it would also attempt to verify the

record regarding Silvia Odio's credibility and the details

of her allegations.

(73) Also of interest to the committee, of course, were

the initial assertions of Loran Hall that he and two associates,

William Seymour and Lawrence Howard, were the ones who had

visited odio

in september. (21) All three had been actively

involved in anti-Castro activity and were members of a group of

soldiers of fortune called Interpen. (22)

The group was arrested

at No Name Key, Florida, in December, 1962 as part of the Kennedy

Administration's crackdown on anti-castro operations. (23) That

policy, which highly incensed the anti-Castro and right-wing

factions, was the result of an agreement Kennedy had made with

HH 53080 DocId:32273595

## Page 49

9 - odio

(24)

Khrushchev and Castro.

Those factions considered

the

agreement a "betrayal". (25)

(14) Joran Hall provided sworn testimony to the Committee

at an Executive Session on October 5, 1977. Here is an

excerpt from that testimony:

Q: Did there come a time when the FBI spoke to

to you about whether or not you visited silvia odio in

September, 1963?

Hall: Yes, there was.

...Q: Who spoke to you?

Hall: An FBI agent.

l: At that time were you advised why you were

being questioned about Silvia Odio?

Hall:

I really don't recall. He stated as

recall, he stated something to the effect that were you

ever

in Dallas, Texas, and I said yes. He said do you

know a Mrs. Odio, and I said I don't recall knowing a

Mrs. Odio. I think I knew a Professor odio, who was a

professor at Texas, some univerity in Texas, just outside

of Dallas, as I recall. He asked me anyway about the

apartment building on Magellan, and I said it is possible,

I don't know. I said do you have a

picture of her

and he

said no, I do not have. And I said, it is possible I met

her but I don't recall. He then asked me who was with me and

I told him I was with Alba and Howard, and then it was like

maybe a month or two.

...Q: And you told him you were there with Howard

and Alba?

HH 53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 49

## Page 50

10 - odio

Hall: Yes.

I: On the first trip?

Hall: Yes. ...we both read the same FBI report.

You know it is directly contradictory to what I am saying.

I: So it is your testimony that at no time did

you ever tell an FBI agent that you were in Dallas accompanied

by Lawrence Howard and William Seymour, is that your

testimony?

Hall: That is true.

Q: Were you ever directly or indirectly involved

with Silvia Odio in acquiring military equipment for anti-

Castro raids?

Hall:

No, I was not. (26)

(75) Connittee Lavestigators interviewed tawrence Howard

on May

23, 1978. Howard stated he has never

met Silvia

odio. (27)

Committee investigator also interviewed William

Seymour, who acknowledged his relationship with

Hall

and

Howard but did not recall any

details

of a trip

to Dallas,

including meeting any Cubans there. (28)

06) The committee felt is important early in its in-

vestigation to examine in detail the substance of Silvia

odio's allegations as well as their credibility. One of

the problems faced by the Committee was Odio's negative

attitude toward a governmental investigation

of the Ken-

nedy assassination. Her attitude, she said, was the result

(29)

of her relationship with the Warren Commission.

She

expressed sharp disillusionment with the Warren Commission

and

said that

it was obvious to her that the Commission

did not want to believe her story. (30) A committee in-

vestigator noted that her whole demeanor was "one of sharp

distrust of the government's motives. She claims she feels

she was just used by the Warren Commission for their own

ends and she does not want to be out in the same position ,(as,

errance indicate

(77)

Basically the Comitteo ete- that Odio's

story remained consistent with her Warren Commission

testimony. There are, however, details concerning odio,

her background and certain points of her story developed

by the committee which should be noted.

(78)

Silvia Odio was one of ten children of Amador

and Sarah Odio who were sent out of Cuba when their

parents began

taking an active part in a counter-revolu-

tionary movement shortly after Castro took power. (32)

Amador Odio was among Cuba's wealthy aristocracy, the

personal friend of diplomats and ambassadors, including,

during the last days of the United States' presence there,

American Ambassador Phillip Bonsal. (33)

odio was owner

of the country's largest trucking business and was once

of General Gerardo Machado in the '30s, Sarah Odio was

barten sag

captured and beaten with a machete until her ribs were

(35)

broken.

Twice during the dictatorship of Fulgencio

Batista, the Odios were forced into exile for their

revolutionary activity. (36) Amador odio's trucks were

the main supply line for the weapons and ammunition which

kept Castro's hopes alive in the mountains. Yet when

the

odios decided that Castro had "betrayed the revolution, " (37)

they were among the founding members, with Manolo Ray,

of one of the early, most aggressive anti-Castro groups,

the Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP), (38)

(19)

Amador and Sarah Odio were arrested by Castro

on October 26, 1961. 139) Their arrest was the result of

the capture of MRP national coordinator Reynald Gonzales

in hiding on their country estate. (40) Ironically, the

Odios had once hosted the wedding of one of Fidel Castro's

sisters on the very estate, a large, resort-like retreat

in El Caño, outside of Havana. (41)

Later, Castro would

turn it into a national women's prison and Sarah Odio

would spend eight years incarcerated there, while her

husband was placed in a cell on Isla de Pinos

(42)

" Reynald Gonzales had been wanted in connection with his

involvement in the

assassination attempt on Castro that

had been organized by Antonio Veciana. (43)

(85) silvia was the oldest of the Odios' ten children.

(44)

She had been sent for her early education to a private

girls' school near Philadelphia and later returned to

cuba and attended vitam faw school there.

(Bi) when her parents were arrested, silvia Odio was

24 years old, living in Puerto Rico with her husband and

four

young children. (46) The next year her husband, sent

to Germany by the chemical firm for which he was working,

deserted her and the children. (47) Destitute and alone,

she began having emotional problems. (48) By that time,

Silvia's younger sisters, Annie and Sarita, were settled

in Dallas. (49)

Sarita, a student at the University of

Dallas, had become friendly with Mrs. Lucille Connell,

the leader of a women's club at a local Episcopal church

who had organized a club program to provide financial and

(50)

social support to the Dallas Cuban Refugee Center.

Connell also happened to be very active in the Mental

Health Association of Dallas and, since her son was a

psychiatrist, had personally acquired an interest in mental

(51)

health problems.

When Sarita told Connell of her

sister Silvia's plight, Connell made arrangements to have

Silvia move to Dallas and to also receive

psychiatric

HH 53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 53

---

## Page 54

13 - Odio

treatment for her emotional problems at the Southwestern

Medical School. (52)

(82) According to Connell, who for a period was

Silvia's closest confidante, Silvia's emotional problems,

brought on by her suddenly being left alone with four

young children, her parents being imprisoned and her life-

style abruptly changing from one of wealth to one of deep

destitution, were manifested in attacks of total loss of

consciousness "when

reality got too painful to bear. " (53)

Connell said

she personally witnessed odio

suffer these

attacks in her home when she first arrived in Dallas, but

with psychiatric treatment their frequency subsided and

they subsequently ended: -- until the Kennedy assassination. (54)

(83) Silvia odio had moved to ,allas in March Of 1963.

(55)

By September of 1963 she was well-established in the com-

munity, had a decent income from

good job, had her

emotional problems under control and was doing well enough

(56)

to be planning a move

into a better apartment.

She was

scheduled to make that move on October 1, 1963, a Monday. (57)

The week before, she recalled, she had done some packing in

preparation for the move and there were boxes scattered

across her living room floor which she had to jump over

(58)

to get to the door.

Her sister Annie, who was then 17,

had come to the apartment to help her and babysit with her

(59)

children.

When the doorbell rang early one evening

in that last week of september, it was Annie who went to

the door to answer it. (60)

(84) the complex in which silvia odio lived at 1084

Magellan Circle in Dallas was a series of garden-type

rental apartments, two-story units with four apartments

to each unit. (61)

The two lower units had front doors

which faced

a common inner vestibule which, in turn,

bordered a small, open cement porch elevated a few steps

above the ground level. (62) Both the vestibule and porch

had overhead lights. (63) Silvia Odio lived in Apartment

A of the 1084 unit, a first floor apartment. (64)

(85a) Annie odio provided the Committee with a sworn

statement of her independent recollection. (65)

She re-

membered the evening

when three men came to the door of

Silvia's apartment in Dallas. (66)

One of the men asked

to speak to Sarita. (67)

He initially spoke English' but

when Annie answered him in Spanish he subsequently also

spoke Spanish. (68) Annie told him that Sarita didn't live

there. (69) Then, according to Annie's recollection:

"He said something, I don't recall exactlywhat, perhaps

something about her being married, which

made me think

they really wanted

my sister Silvia. I recall putting

the chain on the door after I told them to wait while

I went to get Silvia. I don't exactly recall but they

may have also said something about belonging to Jure,

the anti-Castro movement. "I0l

(85b) Annie also recalled that silvia was

initially reluctant

to talk with the strange visitors because she was getting dressed

to go out. But she remembers silvia coming out in her bathrobe

to go to the door. Ill Annie said that she could only recall what

one of the two latin men looked like, but it is not a specific

recollection, only that he was heavy set, had dark shiny hair

combed back and "looked Mexican. "I21 she said "the one in the middle

was American. " 73/

(85c) In testimony to the Committee, independent of her sister's,

Silvia Odio also recalled that

it was early evening and that she was

getting dressed

to go out

when the three men came to the door. 14!

She recalled that it was

a weekday because

she worked that day. I51

She said

the men identified themselves as

members

Of JURE, spoke

of both its founder, Manola Ray, and her father, who had worked

closely with Ray, I61 Odio said that almost all the conversation

she had was with only one of the men, the one who identified himself

as "Leopoldo. "I!!

(85d) odio was positive in

her recollection of the name

"Leo-

poldo"?8/ but said that the men admitted to her they wer giving her

aliases or "war names. "I9/ she is less certain of the other Latin's

name, but believes it

might have been "Angelo" or "Angel." (80) She described

him, as her sister did, as being stocky, with black hair

and looking"more, Mexican than anything else." (81)

The

third visitor, the "American, " 182)

was introduced to her

as "Leon Oswala. " 783)

She said "Leon Oswald" acknowledged

the introduction with a very brief reply, perhaps in

idiomatic Spanish, (84)

but she later concluded that he

could not understand Spanish because of his lack of re-

action to her Spanish conversation with "Leopoldo." (85)

(86) Silvia odio has been relatively consistent in

her testimony to the Warren Commission and to the Committee

in her specific descriptions of the three visitors. (86)

Her description of "Leopoldo" is especially noteworthy

because he has certain very distinct features, including

(87)

an unusual hairline that is sharply recessed on the sides.

Her description of "Leon Oswald", is, of course, similar to

the characteristics of Lee Harvey Oswald.

(88)

There is

absolutely no doubt in her own mind that her visitor

was,

in fact, Lee Harvey Oswald. (89) she points out that she

did have ample opportunity to view him, her conversation

with the three men lasting more than twenty minutes, her

viewing distance being only about three feet and the light

available more than adequate. (90) She also recalls, but

not very clearly, that "Leopoldo" may have

told her that

HH 53080 DocId:32273595 Page 57

---

## Page 58

17 - Odio

(91)

they had just come from New Orleans.

(87) odio told the committee, as she did the warren

(92)

Commission,

that the reason the men came to her was to

get her help in soliciting funds in the name of JURE from

(93)

local businessmen.

She said: "He (Leopoldo) told me

that he would like for me to write them in English, very

nice letters, and perhaps we could get some funds. " (94)

That is not inconsistent with the vague recollection of

her sister Annie, who was in the apartment

at the time

the conversation was

being conducted

through the open

door in the vestibule. She recalled that the men came

because "they wanted something translated. " (95)

(88)

According to Silvia Odio, her conversation with

"Leopoldo" ended without her giving him any commitment to

do anything, but he gave her the impression he would

(96)

contact her again.

The visit ended without "Leon"

or "Angelo" having any conversation with

her aside

from

a brief greeting word of two. (97) After the men left,

odio decided to go to the window and watch them. (98)

She

saw them get into a red car that was

parked in the drive-

way in front of the apartment. (99)

She said she could

not see who was driving the car, but did see "Angelo" on

the passenger side of the car. (100)

(89) The cloudiest part of odio's recollection con-

cerns the telephone call

she later received from

HH 53080 DocId:32273595 Page 58

=

## Page 59

18 - odio

insterdy

"Ieopoldo. " (101)

It could have occurred, she said, the

day after the visit or two days after the visit. (102)

She

thinks it was in the afternoon, but she cannot remember.

(103)

She thinks it was on a Saturday, when she wasn't working,

but is not certain. (104) She is, however, relatively

clear in her recollection of the gist of what "Leopoldo"

told her when he called her on the telephone and that, too,

is consistent with her testimony before the Warren Commis-

sion. (105) She said that "Leopoldo" told her that "the

Gringo" had been a Marine, that he was an expert marksman

and that he was "kind of loco." (106)

She recalled: "He

said that the Cubans, we did not have any guts because we

should have assassinated Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs. " (107)

(90) On the day that President Kennedy was assassinated,

Silvia Odio was coming back from lunch when she heard the

news. (108)

"As soon as we

got back to the office, every-

body had their radios on and everybody was listening to

it." she recadet?By the time the news came that the

President was dead, the president of the company told us

that we could go home. I started going back to -- I was

very frightened and very upset...I started moving across

the warehouse towards the parking lot where we kept our

cars...I think next I had

passed out. My mind was going

around in circles... " (109)

(91) During her testimony before the committee, Odio

asked if, when

she heard that Kennedy was assassinated,

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 59

---

## Page 60

19. - Odio

she thought of the three men who had visited her apartment

almost two months prior. Her reply: "Oh, very

definitely,

very definitely. "(-10)

She added:

"I had put them out

of my mind, but they came back that day. " (Ill)

92) The next thing she remembered after blacking

out was regaining consciousness later in a hospital room. (112)

She recalled that her sister Annie had just walked in.

(113)

She remembered watching the first image of Oswald

she saw

coming across

the television screen in the hospital room:

"Annie and I sort of looked at one

another

and sort of

gasped. She said, 'Do you recognize him?'"

I said yes,

and

I said, 'Do you recognize him?' She said, 'It is the

same guy, isn't it?' I said, 'Yes, but do not say any-

thing. '" (114)

(93) This is an excerpt from the independent sworn

statement given to the Committee by Annie Odio:

On the day of the assassination

of President

Kennedy I had gone with my girlfriend, Cherie

Matlock, and some other friends to a place

where we could see the President's motorcade

pass by. I don't remember where it was, only

that it was quite a distance from downtown

Dallas and Dealey Plaza.

After the motorcade

passed by we went to a drive-in restaurant

for some hamburgers.

When

we were coming

out of

the drive-in we heard

that Kennedy

was

shot.

When I first heard that Kennedy

was

shot I did not make any connection be-

tween the shooting and the men who came

silvia's door.

Later in the afternoon I was

by myself in the Matlock home when I first

saw Oswald on television.

My first thought

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 60

20. - Odio

was,

'My God, I know this guy and I don't

know from where!

But I'm

not going to

tell anybody because they're going to

think I'm crazy.'

'Where have I seen this guy?'

sister Sarita called and told me that

Silvia had fainted at work and that she

was

sending her boyfriend Jim, who is

now her husband

to pick me up

to the hospital to see Silvia.

did not tell me then why Silvia had faint-

ed.

I remember that it was getting dark

when Jim picked me up and that we had to

drive by Dealey Plaza.

I don't remember

Jim coming up to the room in the hospital

with me when I saw Silvia.

I don't re-

member anyone else in the room, but it was

a very small room.

Silvia was in bed.

The first thing I remember when I walked

into the room was that Silvia started

crying and crying.

I don't remember her

saying anything.

I think that I told her:

'You know this guy on TV who shot Presi-

dent Kennedy?

I think I know him.'

And

she

said:

'You don't remember where you

know him

from?'

I said:

'No, I cannot re-

call, but I know I've

seen him before.'

And then she told me: 'Do you remember

those three guys who came to the house?'

And that's when I realized I had seen

Oswald before.

And then when I realized

I had seen Oswald before.

And then she

told me everything, including the fact

that one of the men had called back, that

she called him 'Leon,' that he said he

wanted to be called

'Leon,' and that he

said something like the Cubans should

kill Kennedy because of what he did with

the Bay of Pigs.

Silvia also told me

that when she first heard that President

Kennedy was shot, she started saying:

'Leon did it! Leon did it!'

I remember

that Silvia was very excited at the

hospital and that she kept

saying that (115)

she knew that leon was going to do it.

(94)

Because they were extremely frightened, concerned

for their brothers and

sisters

and their own safety, worried

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page

## Page 62

21 - Odio

about their mother and father in prison in Cuba and

terrifyingly bewildered about the meaning of the three

men's visit, Silvia and Annie Odio decided not

to reveal

the incident.

(116)

And it was, in fact, only circuit-

ously that the FBI came to learn of it.

(95) According to Silvia odio's close friend, Lucille

Connell, she received a call from Silvia's sister Sárita

who told her that Silvia had fainted and was in the

hospital. (117)

Sarita also told her why Silvia had

fainted and the fact that Silvia had met Oswald and that

he had come to her apartment. (118)

Connell cannot recall

exactly

when Sarita called; she said it was either the day

of the assassination or the day after.

(119)

However, that

Sunday, Connell said.: she was speaking on the telephone

to a friend of hers, Mrs. Sanford Pick, then working as a

receptionist in a Dallas law firm office, when they both

saw Ruby shoot Oswald on their television sets. (120).

Connell recalled: "And she said to me, 'Oh my goodness,

Ruby was in our office last week and had power

of attorney

drawn for his sister. " (121)

(9a) Connell said that later that

same day she happened

to be speaking with another friend, Marcella Insua, the

daughter of the head of the Dallas Cuban Relief Committee.

Connell mentioned

to Insua what her other friend had said

about Ruby being in her law office. (122)

Insua, Connell

said, happened to have a class of American children to

HH 53080 DocId:32273595 Page 62

---

## Page 63

22 - odio.

(123)

whom she was teaching Spanish.

In that class, she

got into

a discussion of the Kennedy

assassination

and

mentioned that she knew someone who knew someone who had

some dealings with Ruby. (124). It also happened that

(125)

there was a son of a local FBI agent in Insua's class.

Thate how..subsequently, the FBI came to contact Connell

(126)

and learn about the odio incident.

(97) The committee decided thrat A

factor in judging

Odio's credibility is evidence which indicates that she

told someone prior to the Kennedy

assassiantion that three

men visited her, that one of them was introduced to her as

"Leon Oswald," and that she was told that this "Leon" had

suggested assassinating President Kennedy.

(98)

Silvia Odio told the Committee that immediately

after the visit of the three men, she wrote to her father

in prison in Cuba to ask him if he knew who they were. (127)

Amador Odio, who was released from prison in 1969 and is

now living in Miami, told Committee investigators that he

received Silvia's letter and replied to it. (128)

He did

not recall

when he received the letter, but his reply,

dated December 19, 1963, indicates it was very likely in

late October or early November, 1963. (129) He wrote:

"Tell me who this is who says he is my friend -- be careful.

I do not have any friend who might be here, through Dallas,

so reject his friendship until you give me his name. "(130)

HH 53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 63

## Page 64

23 - Odio

(99) silvia odio told the Committee she recalled,

although her recollection is "not very strong," that she

also told Lucille Connell prior to the Kennedy assassina-

tion that three men had visited her apartment. (131)

She

said it had to have been before the assassination because

she did not see Connell after the assassination as the

result of a falling out between them. (132) Prior to that,

however, Odio said, she was frequently at Connell's house

and she specifically recalled

a dinner party; "which may

have

had

something to do with the Mental Health Associa-

tion or been given in honor of some doctor ór psychiatrist,"

at which, during a conversation in the library, she men-

tioned the visit of the three men. 133) She said it would

have been very likely that she told Connell because "she

(100) Lucille Connell told the Committee she does not

recall Silvia Odio specifically telling her about Oswald

at any time, before or after the assassination. (135)

She

about the visit of the three men was her psychiatrist at

(138)

the time, Dr. Burton C. Einspruch.

At the time of

the Kennedy assassination, Odio had

been seeing Einspruch

for about

seven months, (139) usually on a weekly basis

and occasionally more frequently. (140) She was suffering

from what Einspruch described as "a situational life

problem. She had a large

family, she was semi-impoverished,

she was an immigrant, her parents were imprisoned... she

had all the difficulties one might anticipate a displaced

person would have. " (141)

(102) Both the FBI and the warren Commission staff

questioned Einspruch after the assassination. (142)

The

FBI report noted that Einspruch believed odio "is telling

the truth. "(143) The Warren Commission staff report

noted that "DI. Einspruch

stated that he had great faith

in Miss Odio's story of having met Lee Harvey Oswald. " (144)

Neither report indicated that Einspruch had been questioned

about the specific details of odio's allegations, whether

he had been asked if odio told him about the visit of the

three men and, if she did, when she dia. (145)

(103) In sworn testimony to the Committee, Einspruch

(146 )

reiterated his judgement of odio as a "truthful" person.

He said he no longer had any files available to document

his recollection, but he believes that odio's visits to

him had been scheduled, at around the time of the assassina-

tion, on Wednesdays. (147)

(104) inspruch specifically recalled that odio had

told him, during the normal course

of

the "format" of

the sessions with her in which she related what happened

during the previous week, (148) that she had been visited

by three men. (149)

He recalled that she told him of the

visit prior to the assassination. (150)

He is definite

that she told him that two of the visitors were "Cubans

or Latins" and that the third was an "Anglo." (151)

He

is not

sure

she mentioned the name "Leon" at his session

with her prior to the

assassination. (152)

He did remember

that when he telephoned odio on the day of or the day

after the assassination, she did mention "Leon" and she

did "in a sort of histrionic way" connect the visit of the

three men to the Kennedy assassination and did recognize

one of those men as "Leon." (153)

Einspruch could not re-

call, however, that odio told him prior to the assassina-

tion

that "Leopoldo" had telephoned her and spoke of

"Ieon" suggesting Kennedy be assassinated. (154)

(105) As noted earlier the Committee's ability to

investigate the substance of Silvia Odio's allegations was

severely restricted not only by the time that has elapsed

since they were originally made but also by the lack of

material available in the basic investigative files. Both

HH 53080 DooId:32273595 Page 66

---

## Page 67

26 - odio

the warren Commission and the FBI were lax in the pursuit

of investigative leads when those leads still held a

potential for development. The description provided

by

Odio of at least one of the Latin visitors, for instance,

was detailed enough to justify a thorough canvassing of

both

the anti-Castro and pro-Castro militant Cuban com-

munities in Dallas, New Orleans and Miami for individuals

with

similar

striking characteristics. That, in conjunc-

tion with a search

for the specifically described car the

men were seen driving, might have been fruitful. Committee

reviews of Warren Commission files and FBI reports reveal

no such investigative approach. The focus, instead, was

on attempting to determine the possibility of Oswald

being in Dallas when Odio reported she saw him.

That..

approach proved inconclusive.

Nevertheless, there were other points th

mister could be examined in attempting to determine

the identity of the Silvia odio visitors.

The fact, for

instance, that the men claimed to know her father and have

knowledge of his activities appeared to be of possible

nvestigatory significance. The Committe discovered

however, that a front page article in the Dallas News on

May 5, 1962, could have provided a source of background

information on odio's parents. (155)

The article featured

a large photo of Annie and Sarita Odio and detailed the

plight of their parents in prison as well

as their back-

(156 )

grounds.

It also could be related

to the fact that

"Leopoldo" initially asked for Sarita when

Annie Odio

answered the door. (157)

(107) Although the committee considered the

possibility

that the Odio visitors were being deceptive

in claiming

an association with the anti-Castro organization JURE,

it nevertheless attempted to determine if they were, in

fact, members of that group. The Committee conducted

extensive interviews with Amador Odio, (158)

who was very

active with JURE in Cuba prior to his imprisonment, and

made

an attempt to contact remaining members of the Dallas

chapter of JURE. (159)

Although the results of the Commit-

tee's efforts must be viewed in terms of the lengthy

period of time that had elapsed, the committee could find

no present recollection of JURE members active in 1963

who used the war names of "Leopoldo" or "Angelo" of fitted

the descriptions provlded by silvia dion 260)

(103) In addition, the Committee also interviewed the

founder and leader of JURE, Manolo Ray, now living in

Puerto Rico. (161) Ray said he had been questioned by the

FBI about the Odio incident some time after the Kennedy

assassination, but he was asked only about

silvia Odio's

reliability and credibility. (162)

"They told me that

she had met Oswald," Ray said. "I don't remember them

telling me that the men who came to her said they were

members of JURE...

(163) Ray told the Committee that he

knew of no members of JURE traveling through Dallas in

September of 1963 in search of money or arms. (164)

He

does not recall anyone by the name of "Leopoldo" or

"Angelo" associated with JURE at the time. (165)

He said

he had no American contacts in Dallas, nor did he receive

(166)

any major financial support from anyone there.

(109) In addition to these attempts

to identify the

Odio visitors, the Committee asked

Silvia Odio to review

some

300 photographs of Cuban activists, both pro-Castro

and anti-Castro, and individuals who had or may have had

some association with Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy

assassination. (167) She could not identify any of the

individuals in the photographs as being the two who came

to her apartment with "Leon Oswald."

(11s)

Finally, the Committee requested the CIA to

run a

est check on

all individuals who used the

"war names" of "Leopoldo" and "Angelo" during the period

of interest. (168) The CIA comply resulted in the photo-

graphs of three individuals who might have been in Dallas

in september of 1963. 169) The photographs were shown

to Silvia odio with negative results. (170)

focused on the Castro Revo-

lution.

"He

also made me aware of his concern regard-

ing the Cuban government leaning towards Communism and

tried to impress on me the seriousness of the situation, "

13

Veciana recalled.

(121) Bishop then invited veciana to lunch and during

that and subsequent lunches convinced Veciana to work

against

the Castro Government.

Veciana admittedly did

not need much convincing because he himself had concluded

only thirty days after the Revolution that Castro was a

communist. 14

(127) veciana said he did ask

Bishop

during their

first meeting if he worked for the United States Govern-

ment.

"He told me at the time," Veciana testified, "that

he was in no position to let me know for whom he was

working or for which agency he was doing this. "Is

Bishop also said he could not tell Veciana whether or

not it was Julio Lobo who

suggested he contact him.

"Supposedly Julio Lobo had very important contacts with

the United States Government, " Veciana pointed out. 16

Veciana, however, she later suspected that it might

have been another very close friend, Rufo Lopez-Fresquet,

who put Bishop anto him. 1? Lopez-Fresquet, although

then

Castro's Minister of Finance, was a covert anti-

Government.

(123) Once veciana agreed to work with Bishop on

anti-Castro activity, he was put into a "training

program. "I9 veciana described this as a "two to three

week" program which consisted of nightly lectures.

He

was the only one in the program, which was conducted by

a man he knew only as "Mr. Melton."

The lectures were

held

in an office in a building which Veciana could re-

call

as

being on El Vedado,

a commercial thoroughfare.

He also remembered the building housed the offices

of

a mining company "with an American name" and, on the

first floor, a branch of the Berlitz school of Languages. 20

(|24) Although veciana said he was given some train-

ing in the use of explosives and sabotage techniques,

most of the program consisted of lessons in propaganda

and psychological warfare. "Bishop told me several

times... that psychological warfare could help more than

hundreds of soldiers, thousands of soldiers," Veciana

testified. ?1 veciana saló saia: "The main purpose was

to train me to be an organizer so I was supposed to

initiate a type of action

and other people would be the

ones who would really carry it out. "22

(125) Following the training, veciana worked with

Bishop on several very effective psychological warfare

operations, including a program wish resulted in the

destabilization of the Cuban currency and the creation

of public distrust in its value. 23

Meanwhile, Veciana

also became chief of sabotage for the Movimiento Revo-

R

lucionario del Pueblo (MP), an anti-Castro group headed

MANuel

by Manolo Ray. 24

(|26) Before the American Embassy in Cuba was closed

in January, 1961, Bishop suggested to Veciana that he go tore and

contact certain officials thes for help in his anti-

Castro activity. Veciana said the names suggested by

Bishop were "Smith, " "Sam

Kail"

and "Joe D'Acosta."

Said Veciana:

"Maurice

Bishop suggested

the names

of

these individuals because we needed specific weapons to

carry out the jobs and he told me that these were the

people that could help me. "25 Veciana, however, also

said that Bishop asked him not to reveal his name to

these people. 26

(127) veciana teen has never assumed that Maurice

Bishop was a true name. At one of their early meetings

in Havana, Veciana noticed a Belgian passport which

Bishop had in his open briefcase. Examining it when

Bishop(briefly left the roomy Veciana made a quick note

of it on

a scrap of paper. Veciana kept that scrap of

paper and showed

it to Senator Schweiker's investigator.

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595

Veciana - 6

The name on the paper

was "Frigault". 27

(128) A few months after the failure

of the Bay of

Pigs invasion

in April, 1961, Bishop called Veciana

to a meeting. According to Veciana: "At that time

Bishop decided that the only thing left to be done was

to have an attempt on Castro's life. "28

Although

Veciana himself did not participate in the attempt, he

recruited the action men and organized the operation,

including renting the apartment from which the shot

was to be fired.

However, The day before the actual

attempt, cana escaped from Cuba by boat with his

mother-in-law, in whose name the apartment had been

rented. 30 His wife and children had left

few months

prior. According to Veciana, it was Bishop

who urged

him to leave because, he said, Castro's agents were

becoming suspicious of Veciana's activities. 31

(129) shortly after he settled in Miami, veciana

testified, Bishop again contacted him.

Veciana said

it would have been easy for anyone to locate him in the

close-knit Cuban exile community in Miami. 33 The re-

sult of their re-establishing contact eventually led to

the founding of Alpha 66 which, according to Veciana,

was Bishop's brainchild. "Bishop's main thesis was that

Cuba had to be liberated by Cubans, " veciana testified. 34

Veciana established himself as the civilian chief and

principal fund-raiser for Alpha 66 and recruited the

former head

of the Second National Front of the

(SNFE), Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, as the military

chief. 35

Menoyo had a reputation among Cuban exiles

of being socialistic and Bishop had some doubts about

his loyalty, but Veciana insisted that Menoyo could

be trusted. Besides, he said, "if he did not work

out right we could get rid of him. "36

• Veciana said

that Menoyo was not aware of the existence of Maurice

Bishop.

(130) Alpha 66 became one of the most active of the

anti-Castro exile groups, buying guns and boats, re-

cruiting and training commandos

and conducting

raids on Cuba. 37 At one point, Veciana

proclaimed

numerous

war chest of $100,000 and announced that

all the major

exile organizations were backing

Alpha 66's

efforts.

He alsorpublicly said that all the planning was being

done by leaders "I don't even know. "38

(131) According to veciana, the man behind all of

Alpha 66's strategy was Maurice Bishop. Over the 12-

year period of their association, Veciana estimates he

met with Bishop more than 100 times. 39 Veciana, however,

claims he had no way of getting in touch with Bishop

and that all the meetings were instigated by Bishop, a

40

procedure Bishop established early in their relationship.

To set up a meeting,

Bishop would call Veciana by tele-

phone or, if Veciana

was out of town, call

a third

person whom Veciana trusted, someone who always knew

where herwas. "1 Veciana said that this third person

never met Bishop but "knew that Bishop and I were

partners in this fight because this person shared my

anti-Communist feelings. "42

Bicides

(137) In addition to contacts with Bishop in

Havana and Miami, Veciana also had meetings with him

in Dallas,

washington, Las Vegas

and Puerto Rico and in

43

Caracas, Lima and La Paz in South

America.

(133) veciana specifically recalled

some meetings

with Bishop because of their special nature.

For in-

stance, shortly after re-establishing contact with him

in Miami, Bishop took Veciana to an office in the Pan

American Bank Building in the downtown section of the

city.44 Veciana does not recall the exact floor of

the building nor if there was any name on the office

door. 45 Bishop unlocked the office with a key tentana

saises and in the presence of two men who were in the

office asked him to sign a piece of

46

part in a "commitment" ceremony.

paper and take

"It was like a

pledge of my loyalty, a

secret pledge," Veciana

testified. "I thinkthey wanted to impress on me my re-

sponsibility and my commitment to the cause. "47

Veciana

could not identify the two men who were

present with Bishop at this ceremony, nor does he re-

call if he was introduced to them. "They were like

spectators," he saia. 48

HH 53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 79

Veciana - 9

(134)

From August, 1968 untilJune, 1972, Veciana

worked in La Pz, Bolivia, as a banking advisor to

Bolivia's Central Bank.

His contracts were financed

50

by the U. S. Agency for International Development,

and his office was located in the passport division

51

of the American Embassy.

Veciana believes that Bishop

was instrumental in his getting the AID job, because he

himself was

surprised that the Agency would hire

a

52

known "terrorist" and

anti-Castro activist.

The records

indicate that Veciana was hired

by the Agency even

though his application was never

signed.

53

(125/ while supposedly employed as a banking advisor

in Bolivia, Veciana actually did very little such work,

but instead was engaged mostly in anti-Castro and anti-

54

Communist activities with Bishop.

Among the operations

instigated by Bishop at the time was an attempt to assas-

sinate Castro in Chile in 1971.55

(136). According to veciana, that aborted

assassina-

tion attempt eventually led to the dissolution of his

relationship with Bishop. 56 Although Bishop directed

the operation and provided Veciana with intelligence

information,

Veciana himself

recruited.

• anti-Castro

58

Cuban associates in Caracas to take part in the attempt.

Without his knowledge, Veciana

said, these

associates

introduced a new element into the plan, a scheme to

blame the assassination on certain Russian agents in

59

Caracas.

The associates even produced phony documents

and photographs ander ts do thas 60

When Bishop

later found out about this unauthorized part of the

scheme, he was extremely upset and accused Veciana

of being a part of it. 61 Although veciana told Bishop

he had no knowledge of it, Bishop apparently did not

believe him and eventually suggested that their rela-

62

tionship be terminated.

(137) On July 26, 1973, Bishop arranged for Veciana

to meet with him in the parking lot of the Flagler Dog

Track in Miami. 63

When Veciana arrived, Bishop was

waiting for him with two younger men in an automobile. 64

At that time Bishop gave Veciana a suitcase which,

65

Veciana later ascertained, contained $253,000 in cash.

Since,

at the beginning of their relationship, Veciana

had refused Bishop's offer to pay him for his work with

him, the lump sum payment was meant as compensation for

66

his efforts over the years.

(138). The committee's spanies interest in the rela-

tionship between

Antonio Veciana and Maurice Bishop

is,

of course, predicated on Veciana's

contention that he

saw

Bishop with

Lee Harvey Oswald

in

Dallas

a few

months

before the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

(137) veciana cannot specifically pinpoint the date

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595

Page 81

## Page 82

Veciana - 11

of that meeting with Bishop. He believes it was in

67

late August, 1963.

Over the years that he knew

Bishop, Veciana had at least five meetings with him in

Dallas. 68

The meeting at which Oswald was present took

place in the lobby of a large office building in the

downtown section of the city, perhaps a bank or an

69

insurance building with a blue facade or lobby.

When

Veciana arrived for the meeting, Bishop was there talk-

ing

with Oswald. Veciana does not recall whether he

was

introduced

to Oswald by name, but said he did not

have any conversation with him.

Oswald remained with

Bishop and Veciana only for a brief time as they walked

towards a nearby coffee shop. Oswald then departed and

71

Bishop and Veciana continued their meeting alone.

(140) veciana testified that he recognized the young

man with Bishop as Lee Harvey Oswald after seeing

72

photographs of him following the Kennedy assassination.

There is absolutely no doubt in his mind that the man

was Oswald, not just someone who resembled him.

Veciana

pointed out that he had been trained to remember the

physical characteristics of people and that if it was

not Oswald it was his "exact" double. 73

(141) veciana's next meeting with Bishop was in Miami

about two months after the assassination

of President

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 82

## Page 83

Veciana - 12

Kennedy.14

Although they discussed the assassination

in general, Veciana did not specifically ask

him

about Oswald. "I was not going to make the mistake

of getting myself involved in something that did not

concern me," he testified.?5 also, he said, "...That

was

a very difficult situation because I was afraid.

We both understood.

I could guess that he knew that

I

was knowledgeable of that and

I learned

that

the best

way is not to know, not to get to know things that

don't concern you, so I respected the rules and I dian't

mention that ever. "76

(142) Bishop himself, however, did suggest to veciana

the possibility of some involvement. At the time there

were newspaper reports that Oswald had met with some

Cubans during his visit to Mexico. Veciana said that

Bishop was aware of the fat that he had a relative,

Guillermo Ruiz, who was a high-ranking officer in

Castro's intelligence service stationed in

Mexico City."7

Bishop told Veciana that if he could get in touch

with

Ruiz he would pay Ruiz fa large amount

of money

(publicly.) sawthat it was

him

and his wife who had

met

with Oswala.?8 Veciana agreed to make the attempt to

contact Ruiz because, as he testified, "I knew that Ruiz

would be tempted

with money; he liked money. "79

Veciana, however, was never successful in contacting

Ruiz and when he mentioned it to Bishop a couple of

months later, Bishop told him to forget it. 80

That was

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 83

## Page 84

Veciana - 13

the last time Veciana ever spoke about the Kennedy assas-

sination or Lee Harvey Oswald to Bishop, and, he testified,

he never told anyone about seeing Oswald until questioned

81

by Senator Schweiker's investigator.

(143) In assessing Veciana's testimony, the Committee

made an attempt to evaluate his general credibility and,

concurrently, take the necessary steps to determine if

there

was a Maurice Bishop or someone

using

that

name

and, if there was, with whom he was

associated.

(144) In retrospect, the timing

and

circumstances of

that initial interview with Veciana by Senator Schweiker's

investigator may be a factor in determining his credi-

bility. Two weeks prior to the interview, veciana had

been released from the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta

after serving 27 months on a narcotics conspiracy con-

viction. 82 Veciana, although having served his time,

insisted he was innocent, but claimed that the case

against him was so well fabricated that the Federal

prosecutor actually believed he was guilty. 83 Accord-

ing to Senator Schweiker's investigator, Veciana appeared

confused and frightened by the situation

in

which

he

found

himself, but said he believed

that in

some way his

legal

problems were related

to

his

previous

association

with

Bishop, although he did not know exactly how. 85

The

investigator

speculated that Veciana felt that by

ing his association with Bishop to an official repre-

sentative of the U. S. Government, he would be providing

himself with an element of security. 86 Much later,

however, Veciana apparently changed his position and

decided that Castro agents, not Bishop, were responsible

for his drug arrest. 87 This is inconsistent with in-

formation provided to the Committee by one of Veciana's

closest

associates, who said that Veciana told him that

he thought the CIA framed him because he

wanted to go

ahead

with another plot to kill Castro. 88

This associate,

Professor Rufo Lopez-Fresquet, Castro's former Minister

of Finance, said, however, he was not aware that Veciana

had had any association with anyone like Maurice

Bishop and that he, himself, could not identify Bishop. 89

(145) The committee conducted numerous interviews of

other key anti-Castro associates or former associates of

Veciana, not only as part of its efforts to locate

Bishop but also to further aid in

assessing Veciana's

credibility. Generally, Veciana's reputation for honesty

and integrity was excellent. A former associate, who

worked with him

when Veciana was chief

of sabotage for

the

MRP in Havana,

said: "Veciana

with him in Alpha 66 -- said they were aware of any

American directing Veciana or of anyone who had the

characteristics of Maurice Bishop.

(/46) Nevertheless, there were many aspects of

Veciana's story wash the Committee attemptedsto cor-

roborate. Veciana's claim, for instance, that he was

the principal organizer of the

attempt on Castro's

life in Havana in October, 1961, was documented in a

Cuban newspaper report at the time. 91

Early in their

relationship in Miami, Bishop asked Veciana

to monitor

the activities of

an

anti-Castro operation called

"Cellula Fantasma. "92 Veciana

said he

attended a few

meetings of the group and described the operation as a

leaflet-dropping mission over Cuba which involved known

soldier-of-fortune Frank Fiorini Sturgis. 93

Veciana

said he did not know why Bishop would have been interested

in the operation, but the Committee reviewed files which

confirmed the existence and mission of the group and the

involvement of Frank Fiorini Sturgis at the time. 94

(143)

While Veciana was still in Cuba, among those

at the American Embassy Bishop suggested he contact for

95

aid in anti-Castro operations was a Colonel Sam Kail.

The Committee

ascertained that there was

a Colonel Samuel

G. Kail

at the American Embassy

in

Havana in

1960

at

the

time Veciana said he contacted

him. Kail, now retired,

was located and interviewed

in

Dallas.

HH 53080

Veciana - 16

(148) colonel kail served as the U. s. Army attache

at the United States Embassy in Havana from June 3, 1958

until the day the Embassy closed, January 4, 1961.96

His primary mission as a military attache was that of

intelligence. 97

Later, in February, 1962, he was

transferred to Miami where he was in charge of the unit

which debriefed newly-arrived Cuban refugees.

Although

he reported directly to the Chief

of Army Intelligence

in Washington, Kail said he assumed his unit was actual-

ly functioning for the CIA. "I

suspect they

(149)

Kail said that prior to the American Embassy

closing in Havana, there was a "constant stream" of

Cubans coming through his office with anti-Castro

schemes, including assassination plans, asking for

American assistance in the form of weapons or guarantees

of escaping. "We had hordes and hordes of people

through there all the time," he said.

For that reason,

he said, he did not specifically remember Veciana visit-

ing him.

"I think it would be a miracle if I could

recall him," he said, but does not discount the possi-

bility

that he did meet him.

It happened

"a number of times"; he said that a Cuban would come

in and ask to see Colonel Kail and, when

introduced

to

him, tell him that he was not the Colonel Kail he had

met outside the Embassy. 101 Kail

said he would then

volvement in the assassination

attempt on Castro in

' Chile in 1971. In a report given to Senator George

McGovern in 1975, Castro provided information detailing

the plot 'and accused "counter-revolutionaries from

Alpha 66" as co-conspirators. 104

Veciana himself,

however, was not specifically mentioned. Nevertheless,

Committee intert gates probing the anti-Castro Cuban

community in Miami,found that Veciana's involvement in

the plot was known by many of the active exiles. Max

Lesnik, editor and publisher of Replica, the most pro-

minent

Spanish-language weekly publication in the com-

munity, said he was aware of Veciana's involvement in

the assassination attempt at the time. 105

He said,

HH 53080

DocId:32273595

Page 88

---

## Page 89

Veciana - 18

however, that Veciana told him that it was "his own

plan," and did not mention the involvement of a

Maurice Bishop. 106

Lesnik could not identify Bishop

but said he always did think that Veciana must have had

"some high government contacts, probably CIA. "107

• (153) The Committee also attempted to confirm

Veciana's sole in the Chile plot by locating two other

anti-Castro Cubans allegedly

involved with him. They

were interviewed in Caracas, Venezuela, and, because

they

are not United

States citizens, they could not be

subpoenaed for sworn statements.

(1547)

One of those named was Lucilo Pena. A Cuban-

born graduate of Auburn University in Georgia, Pena is

now a Venezuelan citizen and a sales manager for a large

chemical firm. He has lived in Venezuela since 19%1. 108

(155) Although Pena denied any involvement in the

Castro assassination plot in Chile, he admitted to know-

ing Veciana since "1964 or 1965," when he was active in

Alpha 66's "Plan Omega," a plot to invade Cuba from

base in the Dominican Republic. 109

He said he first

met Veciana

through a friend, Secundino Alverez, who was

the Caracas chapter

leader of. Alpha 66.110

(Alverez

was among those named by Veciana as also being involved

in the Chile

plot.) 111

Pena admitted he had been in

contact with Veciana during the period the Chile plot

was being planned

but, he said, their meetings were

HH 53080

DocId:32273595 Page 89

Veciana - 19

only casual, usually at boxing matches which Veciana

promoted.

112 Pena

also admitted that Veciana

may

have

discussed

the

possibility

of assassinating Castro

with

him during one of these

encounters

at

the boxing

matches.

"I think he asked

some help in

raising money,"

Pena said, "but that's all I know about that. "113

Pena

denied any knowledge or involvement in any plot to

blame Russian agents for the planned Castro assassination

in Chile. "I am not the type to do that kind of

counter-intelligence work," he said.

"I am too open

and honest. "114

(156) Pena, however, admitted to knowing, perhaps

since 1963, Luis Posada, another anti-Castro Cuban in

Caracas who Veciana claims was

also involved in the

plot to kill Castro in Chile. 115

('s orite sente interviened

Luis

Posada in

the Venezuelan political prison, Cuartel

San Carlos, in Caracas. Posada had been

arrested in

October, 1976, along with well-known anti-Castro Cuban

terrorist Orlando Bosch, and indicted for being in-

volved in the bombing of a Cubana Airlines plane in

which 73 persons were killed. 116

(158) posada had earlier been linked with assassina-

tion plots against Cuban officials in Chile, including

two who disappeared in August, 1976.117

HH 53080

## Page 91

Veciana - 20

(15) posada's background as a military and intelli-

gence operative is eclectic. He was a member of Brigade

2506 but did not take part in the Bay of Pigs landing. 118

In 1963 he joined the U. S. Army and was commissioned

a first lieutenant.

119 | He resigned his commission in

1961 lend became an agent for the cran

He went to

Venezuela in 1967 and shortly afterwards joined the

Venezuelan secret police, called DISIP, the Direccion

de los Servicios de Inteligencia y Prevencion. 121 From

1971 to 1973 he was chief of operations of the General

Division of Security for DISIP, which included counter-

intelligence. 122

He resigned from

DISIP

in 1973

and

went to Washington, D. C. to take training from what he

termed "a

private company" in the field of lie detection. 123

He then returned to Caracas to open his own private

detective agnecy.

(160) posada told Committee investigators that he

was not involved in the Castro assassination attempt in

Chile in 1971.124

He admitted that he knew Veciana but

said he only met him twice, once in Miami and once in

Caracas at the boxing matches. 125

He said he did talk

to Veciana about the

time the Chile plot was being

planned, but Veciana never mentioned

anything to him

about it.126

HH 53080

DocId: 32273595 Page 91

## Page 92

Veciana - 21

(161) Another aspect of Veciana's allegations

that

were

of seen interest to the Committee was Bishop's

suggestion of developing a misinformation scheme involv-

ing a Castro intelligence agent and Oswald.

127 Veciana

said that Bishop knew that a relative of his was in the

Cuban Intelligence service assigned to Mexico City at

the time of the Kennedy assassination. 128

According to

Veciana, a news story was circulating immediately after

the assassination that Oswald had met

a couple on the

Mexican border while on his way to Mexico City prior to

the assassination. 129

Bishop, Veciana said, suggested

he attempt to get in touch with his relative

offer

him

a bribe to say that it was

he and his wife who met

Oswald in Mexico. 130 veciana said he was never able to

get in touch with his relative about it and eventually

Bishop told him to forget it, 131

(162) The name of Veciana's relative is Orestes Guil-

lermo Ruiz Perez and he is, in fact, a relative by

marriage, the husband of a first cousin to Veciana.

Veciana said he first learned of Ruiz's affiliation with

Castro's intelligence service shortly after Castro took

power.

He and Ruiz were walking in a Havana park when

they were

stopped

and

searched by Castro's police.

RUiZ

was found

to be carrying a gun and was

taken away.

Con-

cerned, Veciana immediately placed a call to

a close

friend

## Page 93

Veciana - 22

Rufo Lopez-Fresquet. Lopez-Fresquet

told Veciana not

to worry about Ruiz because Ruiz was actually working

for

the intelligence service. 133

(163) Although Ruiz was a Castro' agent and Communist,

he warned Veciana that he was being observed visiting

the American Embassy in Havana and told him to be care-

£u1. 134

is

That ,why veciana later thought that he might

be able to turn Ruiz into an anti-Castro agent. Sometime

after the Kennedy assassination, 'Veciana said he was ap-

proached by another anti-Castro Cuban named Robert Vale•

Whom he knew to be working for the CIAl135

Vale asked

Veciana to attempt to contact Ruiz about possibly be-

136

coming

an asset for the CIA.

Ruiz, at the time, was

stationed

in Spain

and when Veciana

found

friend,

Roblejo Lorie, who was traveling to Spain, he asked him

to carry a letter to Ruiz. Lorie gave the letter to

Ruiz but, according to Veciana, Ruiz tore the letter

up in front of lorie and told him that he did not want

to have any contact with Veciana because he knew Veciana

"was working for the CIA. "137

(164) The committee was able to interview Orestes

Guillermo Ruiz in Havana. 138 Ruiz acknowledged that he

was related to Veciana through marriage. 139

He said

that "everyone in Cuba" knows that Veciana is associated

with the CIA and was involved in assassination attempts

on Castro. 140

He

said, however, aside from

what he

read in the American newspapers he has no knowledge of

Veciana's association with Maurice Bishop or who

Maurice Bishop could be. 141

He said he was never con-

tacted by Veciana about Oswala142 and, in fact, has not

seen Veciana since 1959.143

(165) Ruiz expressed disdain for Veciana,

said he con-

sidered him a cowara144

and "a

person you cannot believe."

He said Veciana had personality problems and was under

phychiatric care from the time he

was 16 years old until

145

he was 21.

Ruiz said that "another

counter-revolu-

tionary," a cousin of Veciana's who is a doctor "in

Miami dr Chicago" and whose name is Jose Veciana, could

attest to Veciana's psychiatric problems because he had

146

advised the family about them.

(1666)

Committee investigators located Dr. Jose

pathology at Volunteer General Hospital. He confirmed

dition because he knows that Veciana had to undergo

vigorous tests in his rise in the hanking business. 149

(16% veciana hinself denied Ruiz's allegations that

he had had psychiatric problems as a young man.

His

mother confirmed his denial. 150

The Search for Bishop

(168) One of the factors utilized in the Connittee's

efforts

to locate Maurice Bishop

was the description of

him provided

by Veciana. When he

first met him in 1960,

Veciana said, Bishop was about 45

years old, about 6'2"

tall, weighed over 200 pounds and was athletically built.

He had grey-blue eyes, light brown hair and a light

V that

complexion.

However, Veciana said, 'Bishop appeared

to spend a lot of time outdoors or in sunny climate be-

cause he was usually well-tanned and there was

some skin

152

discoloration, like sun spots, under his eyes.

He

appeared to be meticulous about his dress and usually

concerned about his weight and diet.

the latter

years that Veciana knew him, Bishop took to using glasses

for reading. 154

(16) shortly after he revealed his Bishop relation-

ship to Senator Schweiker's

investigator, Veciana aided

a professional artist

in developing a composite sketch of

Bishop. Schweiker's office provided the Committee with

a copy of the sketch. Veciana told the Committee that

he considered the artist's composite sketch of Bishop a

HH 53080

DocId:32273595 Page 95

## Page 96

Veciana - 25

"pretty good" resemblance. 155

(177) Prior to the Committee's efforts, Senator

Schweiker's office, as well as the Senate Select Sub-

committee he headed, looked into certain aspects of

Veciana's

allegations. Schweiker, for

instance, re-

quested the Belgian Embassy to conduct a record check

for information about a passport issued under the name

of "Frigault." The Belgian Embassy

said that, without

additional

identifying information, it could not help. 156

In addition, Schweiker's investigator showed Veciana

numerous

photographs of individuals who may have used

the name of Bishop, among them Oswald's friend, George

deMohrenschildt, who was then a teacher at Bishop College

in Dallas. The results were negative. 157

(171) It was senator schweiker who focused the Con-

mittee's attention on David Atlee Phillips, former chief

of the western Hemisphere Division of the CIA Deputy]

Directorate of Operations, as perhaps having knowledge

of Maurice Bishop. Immediately after receiving the

Bishop sketch, Schweiker concluded that Phillips, who

had

earlier

testified before

the

Senate Select Committee

on Intelligence Activities, bears a strong resemblance

to the sketch.

present at a luncheon meeting of the Association of Retired

Intelligence Officers in Reston, Virginia, on September

17, 1976. Phillips was one of the founders of the Association.

Veciana was introduced to Phillips prior to the luncheon.

He was introduced by name but not by affiliation with Alpha 66

or involvement with anti-Castro activity. According to

Schweiker's investigator, there was no indication of

CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL

A Concise History

205) The forerunner of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) was

the Frente Revolucionario Democratico. (FRD), Formed in May, 1960%

- dy

At the head of it were the leaders of five major anti-

Castro groups. The proclaimed purpose of the FRD was to establish

a democratic government in Cuba through the use

of military force.

(206) The FRD (nitially set up headquarters

in Mexico, but recruited

most of its proposed invasion force from Miami.

The military arm

of the FRD was known as Brigade 2506.$4

The Brigade eventually was

composed of 1,443 men who were trained by U.s.

Army specialists

at two sites on the south coast of Guatemala.

207) The leaders and their organizations which composed the ERD

Executive Committee were: Aureliano Sanchez Arango of the Triple A

group; Justo Carrillo of Montecristi: Antonio de Varona of

Rescate; Manuel Artime of the Revolutionary Recovery Movement (MRR) ;

and DI. Jose Ignacio Rasco of the Christian Democratic Movement

116

(MDC) •

Antonio de Varona served as General Coordinator

and the

membership

was soon expanded to include DI. Antonio Maceo, a

duties in January, 1962, but, he told the Committee, found it

necessary to resign by October of that year because his job

entailed extensive traveling. Il During his short tenture, Rabel

said he organized several rallies and brought in prominent Miami

speakers to enthuse the New Orleans Cuban exile community!2

Other than going to the Camp Street address to remove office

materials left there by Arcacha, Rabel said he had no connection

Orleans CRC chapter. He reported the activities of the group

regularly to the FBIls and was primarily concerned with

solicitation of monthly pledges from Cubans for the purchase of

arms for their countrymen actively engaged in the fight against

Castro. 16

He reported that he had purchased an M-2 rifle with

collections and displayed it at an October, 1963 meeting for

"psychological reasons". 17

however; because of

apare Bartes said,

#^the rate of

collections at that time, the group was able to send only enough

money to the Miami CRC headquarters to purchase one gun per month. 18

232) Noithez anti-Castro Cuban group more naturally attracted

the initial attention of the Committee than Brigade 2506, the

organization specifically formed/for the Bay of Pigs invasion

and the one which experienced the most dramatic relationshi?

with the Kennedy administration in terms of its hopes and

failures.

(233) Following their release from Castro's prisons in December

of 1962, the members of the Brigade harbored deep-seated emotional

• conflicts in their attitude towards the Government. An observer

who watched them arrive in Miami noted: "There were earnest,

bewildered, still in a state of shock at their sudden liberation,

still nursing a bitter sense of betrayal at the manner in which -

they were sent ashore and abandoned, still torn between trust

and cynicism, still in awe at the power of an American govern-

ment that could, at will it seemed, pluck them out

of the

darkest dungeons in Havana and on the Isle of Pines and deposit

them back in florida with their families by Christmas Eve." I

After Castro's assumption of power in 1959, it became

evident to many Cubans that political parties were being

surpressed and the 26th of July Movement was

being infil-

to the creation of underground organizations such as the

Christian Democratic Movement of Cuba (MDC). I

Proclaining

the doctrine of Christianity as its foundation, the MDC

published a manifesto in March, 1960? denouncing Communism

and strongly advocating the free enterprise system.?

One

of the founders of the MDC, 35-year-old law professor,

DI. Jose Ignacio Rasco, was elected head of the organization

and immediately criticized the violence prevalant in the

Castro regime." This public criticism produced pressure on

failure of the Bay of Pigs

invasion, her friend, William Pawley, persuaded her to help

sponsor a fleet of motor boats for a group of anti-Castro

Cubans who, Pawley

envisioned, would be Cuban "Flying Tigers,"

shooting in and out of Cuba on intelligence-gathering missions.

Pawley had helped start General Claire Chennault's original

Flying Tigers in World War II. Luce said she

agreed to sponsor

one boat and its three-man crew. She said she met with this

Cuban boat crew about three times in New York and, in 1962,

(324) when four of castro's army officers and lod mer

deserted and left for the Las Villas mountains in August,

1960, they formed the nucleus of the Movimento Insurreco-

ional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR) . Helping ay the

groundwork for this organization was the former Chief of

the 26th of July Movement in Las Villas Province, DI. Orlando

Bosch Avila.? Bosch had left Cuba one month previously and,

from Miami, issued a call for rebel army men to desert. 3

Promoting the defection of army personnel and carrying out

sabotage operations throughout Cuba were the early prinary

activities of the MIRR. 4

In both, it was very effective.

(325) Former rebel army officer Victor Paneque assumed

military leadership of the group and, within a few months

of his escape from Cuba, organized a

team of infiltrators

to re-enter the country to continue MIRR operations. 6

widely viewed in the U.S. press as a Cuban patriot when he

first began his anti-Castro activities, Bosch's increased

acts of violence gradually changed his image to that of a

terrorist.10 The intensity and violence of his activities,

which have always been widely publicized, were a major

factor in the Committee's decision to examine Boach and

the MIRR among those Cuban exile organizations considered

capable of involvement in an assassination conspiracy.

(344) Arriving in Miami in May of 1963, Sierra scheduled

a series of meetings at a local hotel and invited Cuban

exile leaders of all political persuasion to discuss

unification for the purpose of military invasion of Cuba. 3

(145) To many cubans the idea

seemed ridiculously naive.

Sierra was hoping to unify elements which had remained

splintered throughout most previous efforts, attempting

to draw well-known exile leaders when he himself was

virtually unknown. in the anti-Castro movement.

(346) But Sierra came with some big ideas and big pronises.

He claimed to represent a group of Americans in Chicago

interested in combining their efforts with those of the

Cuban exiles to overthrow the Castro regime with or

without U.s. government approval. sierra told them that

American financial interests

would participate on con-

dition there was a true unity of the majority of Cubans

in exile." For military planning he claimed he had the

assistance of several high-ranking U.S. Navy and Army

officers, who would also help arrange for arms and the

establishment of training bases in a latin American country.

Most surprisingly, Sierra claimed the Chicago backers

were willing to lend assistance to the extent of $30 million

no small sum even for a large-scale government-

backed operation. For a private group it was unheard of.

(347) while many Cubans did not innediately jumpronto, Sierra, s

(348) Anong the groups to join sierra's junta were the

faction headed by Juan Medina Vega

and the major faction of the 30th of November group

headed by Carlos Rodriguez Quesada. Sierra could also

boast the participation of Jose "Pepin" Bosch, President

(355) By early 1963 Sierra had organized a Cuban Lawyer's

as "coordinator" of Cuban activities in the Chicago area.

In March 1963, he was mentioned in an article in the

that although he did not know the identity of Sierra's

control to avoid any possible criticism of misappropriation

or mismanagement of funds by Sierra.

Browder would not

(359) There have been several contradictory reports to the CIA

and FBI regarding the source of Sierra's funds.

(360) Early reports indicated Sierra's backers were Chicago :.-

gamblers. The Miami News headline for an article reporting

on Sierra's meetings read "Gamblers Pop Out of Exile Grab Bag.

The source of such reports is unclear although there are

indications it may have been Sierra himself.

(361) At Sierra's initial

meetings withh cuban groups, he was

accompanied by an American named William Trull, who may have

been Ayrtly responsible for circulation of runors of the involvenes

of gambling interests in Sierra's proposals, but whose

ultimate relationship to sierra is obscure.

(362) In an interview with the FBI in June

1963, Sierra said

TIull had called him after seeing the March 10 article

about Sierra in the Chicago Iribune.

Sierra said Trull

talked about sponsorship of a unified group of Cuban

exiles and vaguely mentioned the owner of the ring

Ranch and a MI. "Jarvis" who Trull identified as a

millionaire in Texas.

Sierra said he was concerned

about Trull being involved with "impure" financial sources,

$837

and would have nothing further to do with him.

(363) Trull's story is differant. A formez entertaines

from Dallas, Trull said Sierra had first contacted him

in March 1963 and proposed that he hele sierga explain

Sierra's plan to the Cuban exiles in Miami.

said Sierra had wired tickets so that he could join

$039

Sierra in Miami for the series of meetings with the exiles.

Sierra carefully outlined the proposal Irull was to explain

to such Cuban leaders as former Cuban Prime Minister

€ 40

Carlos Prio and Eusebio Mujal, a former Cuban labor leader.

Trull reiterated the plan to the Cubans, telling them

he represented wealthy American interests who had a business

proposition for the Cuban people if they would unify

with Carlos Prio as President and Sierra as Secretary of

42 4/

a provisional government.

(364) Reports by Cubans who heard Trull lend credence to

his tale. Irull was found to be "contradictory" and

8042

"vague" about his plan, as might be expected of a person

who was just repeating what he had been told.

(365) Trull later told FBI agents that he had aropped names

to sierra such as clebrug of the king Ranch, but sierra

had told him he did not need Irull's financial influence.

Sierra claimed, according to Trull, that representatives of

Las Vegas or Cleveland gambling interests had contacted

him and offered up to $14 million in exchange for 50%

interest in gambling concessions in Cuba, provided Sierra

was able to organize a successful ouster of Castro.

(366) Trull told the FBI that because

he had frequently

he felt he had been

(367) sierra had other assistance at his early meetings

"Nevada group" would help since the U.S. government could

the job of head of police in Cuba when the country had

learned that Sierra alone had spent a little over $11,000

on travel expenses by October 1963.

851564

(377) The group was also spending money on arms and equipment

by late summer 1963. Rich Lauchli, a well-known arms

dealer from Collinsville, Ill., was contacted by Sierra in

GET 65

August to purchase a quantity of guns. Soldier-of-fortune

an arms shopping spree in Detroit accompanied by Jose

Cardoso, and purchased $6000 to $7000 worth of weapons

Members of the Junta's board of officers also received

contributions from Sierra. Carlos Rodriguez Quesada

recieved $2800; Felipe Rivero Diaz received $1890;and Gilberto

Rodriguez got $1500.

(381) There are vazious descriptions of the miltary operations:

allegedly being prepared by the Junta. On October 30, 1963,

information was received that the Second National Front

of Escambray had plans for an operation from a base in the

8280

Dominican Republic. The arrangements were allegedly

being made by. Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, head of SNEE, and

& 81

Abel Camacho in Key West. The plan called for action

against a bridge in Oriente Province and had been master-

minded by Antonio Veciana

and one of the engineers who

81382

had designed the bridge. Consistent with this information,

it was also reported to the FBI that the Junta

offered

soldier-of-fortune Joe Garman $11,000 to lead

a raid on

88083

Oriente Province.

(382)

There were other reports that an attack on a Havana

8P4

oil refinery was planned. Still other reports simply

indicated that although all-out war against Castro was

the objective, a hit-and if raia for publicity puzposes

would be attempted first.

Junta. Gilbeto Rodriguez Hernandez was replaced as military

Sierra, Hernandez was feared to be a Castro agent. In

turn, Hernandez, who had returned from Cuban prison in

April 1963 in the prisoner exchange, called Van Gorkum

objected to the inclusion of such a "left-wing"

organiza-

tion, but also protested Sierra's expenditures.

(385) These complaints nay have had something to do with

Sierra's summons to Chicago in early November 1963 for

90

a stormy session with Browder. Sierra was blasted for

91

wasting funds, reportedly totaling up to $50,000.

According

to sources of the CIA and FBI, Sierra was accompanied to

the Chicago meeting with Armando Fleites of SNFE and

Browder allegedly ordered Sierra to turn over all monies

and supplies to the SNFE-Alpha 66 alliance. But although

several of the Junta officers had asked for Sierra's replace-

ment and had specifically named Jose "Pepin" Bosch as

an attractive alternative, Sierra remained in place as the

94

"guiding spirit" for the next two months em the remainder

of the group's existence.

(386) A CIA memo reported on vovember 20, 1963 of the strange

activities of Sierra and

the Junta:

somewhat of a mystery-man in terms of his

objectives."

The report also raised the question of how Sierra managed

to remain in the exile political scene so long. "Perhaps

his mysterious backers are providing him with sufficient

funds to keep the pot boiling for the present," the memo

conjectured.

Ferrie spent considerable time studying

medicine and psychology, last especially the techniques

of hypnosis which he frequently practiced on his young

associates.

Ferrie had even set up a laboratory

character considered him an excellent pilot.

worked as an insurance inspector, and joined the Army

other activities related to flying, including the Civil

Air Patrol, which he had first joined in Cleveland.

authorities of the Civil Air Patrol would increase, but

Ferrie remained intensely popular with many of the

members and enjoyed a reputation as a first rate in-

69

structor and organizer.

Fail Jean Naatz, an aviatrix

of national renown,

stated,.

• "He had done more

for the Civil Air Patrol than anyone else and built up

the squadron to one of the biggest squadrons in the

state of Ohio."

4/3 Ferrie also built the same reputation with

many CAP cadets in the New Orleans area.

One CAP com-•

mander said, "David Ferrie is a good organizer...He made

the CAP at the New Orleans Airport everything it is

today.

He has a large following among the cadets of the

71

CAP, and is an excellent flying instructor." M

.By

1953, there were about 80 cadets assigned to his

squadron.

Ferrie spent about six hours a week in

official CAP activity and much more of his own time

73

associating

with his cadets. T

Ferrie became known

for his enthusiastic approach to cadet training, emphasiz-

ing tutoring in science and mathematics and putting .

74

cadets in charge of their own discipline. The squadron

had an award-winning drill team.

14140

His appeal to several young men may have been

related to his taking an extraordinary interest in them:

he gave them

own airplane;

where liquor flowed freely;

Many of Ferrie's

cadets became involved in Ferrie's wide spectrum of

activities.

subject with many parents.

Ferrie did not bother to renew his CAP commander

He did renew his commander charter in 1959, when

he augmented his cadet's standard CAP rifle training by

Ferrie also started a group called

It Z8/ an intensive New Orleans police investigation

of the charges against Ferrie produced statements from

several boys that Ferrie had committed indecent acts

117

with them.

The boys also told investigators Ferrie had

told them he had had homosexual relations with a married

118

man in Houston.

. On August 26, Eastern Airlines

119

removed him from the payroll for an indefinite period

and the Federal Aviation Administration then opened its

120

own investigation into the charges.

429) with his problems mounting, Ferrie sought

121

legal aid from New Orleans attorney G. Wray Gill, Sr.

Ferrie later testified that he and Gill had entered into

an agreement in March,, 1962 that Gill would represent

Ferrie in his legal difficulties in return for Ferrie's

122

research and investigative work on

other cases for Gill.

430)

Ferrie also testified that he also entered into

123

a similar arrangement in February, 1962 with Guy Banister,

124

a former FBI agent who ran

a private investigative firm.

By the terms of the agreement, Ferrie's work for

Banister included analyzing autopsy reports in payment

for Banister's investigative services.

Banister stated

126

he handled Ferrie's case "personally".

(<431)

Ferrie may have first met Banister late

in 1960

or early 1961 when Banister, also a strong anti-Communist,

was helping to establish the "Friends of Democratic Cuba"

organization as

a adjunct to Sergio Arcacha

Smith's CRC.

At the time, Banister's investigative business

and the

CRC were both located in the Balter Building. In Febru-

ary, 1961, Banister was conducting background investi-

gations of the members of the CRC from a list provided

by Arcacha Smith. In early, 1962, both moved their

offices to the Newnan Building, which carried the two

addresses for the two

streets it faced: 531 Lafayette

13I

and

544 Camp Street.

432) Jack Martin, a private investigator associated

132

with Banister, may also have been contacted by Ferrie

for assistance on his case. Ferrie testified in August

1963 that he had helped Martin on a case involving a

phoney religious

November, 1961. Later, Martin wrote letters to the FAA

134

and Eastern Airlines on Ferrie's behalf.

(433) With this assistance, Ferrie was able to xe-

solve many of his difficulties.. At the end of February

1962, Ferrie was tried and acquitted of the charges

of extortion.

The other charges were nolle prosequied

136

in November 1962.

During this period, Ferrie

I was often seen

at Banister's

436) Ferrie's final grievance hearing was set for

July 15, 1963, in Miami. Ferrie, Gill and Banister

were in Miami on July 15, 16, and 17 while Eastern Air-

151

these hearings reveal that the company's charges were

based on Ferrie's deliberate omissions and inaccuracies

in his original application to the company; charges of

Ferrie's moral turptitude; and his having misrepresented

152

himself as a medical doctor and psychologist..

153

437) The hearings were resumed on August 5th. Testi-

fying in Ferrie's defense were former CAP cadet John

Layton Martens provided a sworn deposition in defense

of Ferrie's character. Banister testified to Ferrie's

good character supposedly based on his own investigation

of Ferrie.

In cross-examination Banister

could not rationalize to the satisfaction of the hearing

board the reasons for Ferrie's vitugerative remarks in

1961 against President Kennedy® nor could he adequately

explain Ferrie's involvement with a questionably legiti-

158

mate church group.

(438) On September 30, Ferrie received the final

decision from the Eastern appeal board:

a unanimously

160

upheld his discharge.

(439) By the Fall dE 1963, Fezrie had become actively.

involved in the defense investigation of Federal

charges of a fraudulent birth certificate against Carlos

Marcello, an alleged organized crime leader in New Or-

161

leans.

UU) Ferrie's ties to the Marcello organized crime family

apparently continued at least until July 1966. As of that

time, Ferrie was involved with Jacob Nastasi, a known associate

of the Marcello family who had been the subject of an FBI probe

of racketeering in the New Ofleans area, in

a commercial

cargo airline venture, Space Airfreight Lines, Inc.

Previously

he had been involved in the United Ait Taxi Service with

1633

other suspected Márcello associates.

(441) Ferrie's involvement with

begun as early as the Spring of 1961.

An

unconfirmed

from the Immerarice and Naturalizarion service

Border Patrol report of February 1962Valleges that Ferrie

was the pilot who flew Carlos Marcello back into the

United States from Guatemala after he had been deported

Robert Kennedy's crackdown on organized crime. This

may have helped Ferrie establish an enduring relation-

ship with the Marcello organized crime family-

442) The return of Marcello to the United States

(chronologically coincided with Ferrie's activities with

the Cuban Revolutionary Counsel

According to Carlos

Quiroga, a Cuban who had been involved with the.

CRC,

Ferrie often provided Arcacha Smith with fundso

stating;

"Ferrie lent him (Arcacha Smith) money

when he needed it for his family...He (Ferrie) had

hundred dollar bills around all the time,"

he had lost his job with the airlines

even after

(443) An FBI report of April, 1961 indicates Mar-

cello offered Arcacha Smith a deal whereby Marcello

would make a substantial donation to the movement in

return for

concessions in Cuba after Castro's over-

EM69

throw. One explanation of Ferrie's ability to provide

funds to Arcacha Smith may be that he acted as Marcello's

financial conduit.

(444) Another indication of an early ferrie relation

ship with the Marcello organized crime family may be

the legal assistance pathat Marcell Janyer, Jack wasserman,

provided to Ferrie associates, Layton Martens, who identified himself to

544 CAMP STREET

(460) on August 9, 1963, Ice Harvey Oswald was arrested

on Canal Street in New Orleans and charged with disturbing

the peace. The arrest was the result of a confrontation

with anti-Castro Cuban exile Carlos Bringuier and two

of his associates, Miguel Cruz and Celso Hernandez.

in New Orleans-- as"544 Camp Street, New Orleans, La."

(462) This pamphlet was among the materials turned over by

following the assassination.

then set out to investigate the 544 Camp Street address.

These agencies established several facts:

kit in the same manner Oswald had stamped other literature

with his alias "A. J. Hidell" or "L. H. Oswald,"

indicating

it was by Oswald's own hand that the 544 Camp Street address

was printed on the pamphlet.

(404) It was learned also that Oswald had written to the

Vincent T. Lee, on August 1, 1963, eight days before his

arrest.

In the letter, Oswald mentioned he had rented

an office for his local FPCC chapter, but was told to

vacate after three days because the building was to be

remodeled.

(465) The FBI and the Secret Service investigation

apparently focused on whether or not Oswald actually

14

had rented an office at the 544 Camp Street address.

(466) In interviews with the FBI and the Secret Service,

the building owner, Sam Newman, denied renting an office

to Oswald. .

Others renting office space at 544 Camp

at the Newman building or elsewhere in New Orleans.

Secret Service received information that an office in the

Council from October 1961 through February 1962.

Leaders

of the CRC were contacted and asked if they had any associa-

tion with or knowledge of Oswald or the Fair Play for Cuba

Service report that no additional evidence had been

found to indicate Oswald ever maintained an office

21

at the 544 Camp Street address.

(469) The committee investigated the possibility of

a connection between Oswald and 544 Camp Street with

gure different results.

471) The Committee learned

fan its research that the

Newman building occupied the corner lot facing Lafayette

Square. On one side its address was

544 Camp Street.

23

Its other entrance was addressed 531 Lafayette Street.

It was

three-story granite structure owned and operated

by Sam Newman as a rental income property

for

commercial

offices.

(470)The Committee interviewed Sam Newman and other witnesses

to obtain a complete list of the occupants of the building

for the period from

May, 1963, when Oswald arrived in New

Orleans, to September, 1963, when he departed.

4T@/Newman told the .Committee he had great difficulty

renting space in the buidling. Consequently, there were

It was also the entrance

which led to the quarters of the the building's janitor,

Street address, that of Guy Banister Associates, a private

investigative firm.

The offices once rented by the

29

Cuban Revolutionary Council at 544 Camp still lay empty.

"Mancuso's", a small coffee shop, was located on the ground

floor with its own entrance onto the corner of Camp and

Lafayette streets.

(473) The Cormittee located and interviewed individuals associated

with these organizations. Whenever possible, the Committee

obtained relevant records from the organizations to check

for any link to Oswäld or persons implicated in the

assassination investigation. The Comittee investigation

produced no evidence of any connection between Oswald

and

any

person or organizations occupying

the

Newman Building

in 1963, except for that involving Guy Banister's private

detective agency.

(474) Before Inching tito a discussion of the investigation

of the Banister office,

this nateual set forth at the results

of the investigation into the other occupants of 544 Camp

Street.

(475) The Hotel, Motel and Restaurant Employees Union is

known today as the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartender's

31

Union (International). Although the Committee was unable

to locate personnel who had worked in the office at 544 Camp

Street and had been interviewed by the Secret Service

following the assassination, the Committee did obtain

• a "master"

membership list from the union. The lists contained names of memkers for th

years. 1962 through 1964

were studied for names of

associates

of Oswald or others of interest in the investigation.

Among the names appearing on the list as a member from.

33

October..30, 1962, "through April 1963" was Kerry Thornley,

who had been an dequaintance of Oswald's for "three or

four months

when both were stationed at the El Toro Marine

34

Corps base in Santa Aña, California.'

Later, Thornley

learned from newspaper accounts of Oswald's defection

to the soviet Unions

Thornley found the story so interesting

36

that he set out to write a novel based

on Oswald's defection.

(476) Nevertheless, the committee's investigation of kerry

Thornley uncovered nothing of significance in the appearance

of Thornley's name on the list of members of the union.

As reflected in the union's records, Thornley dropped his

37

membership after April 1963. Thornley had left New Orleans

to travel to California and Mexico and did not return to

38

New Orleans until August 1963, leaving little overlap of

time in which Oswald and Thornley could have possibly come

in' contact.

(477) In testimony before the coumittes Thomley has firmly denied

contact with Oswald at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans or

at any time since his Marine Corps days.

His statements

have been feund bugg

has been president of the union since 1960

and confirmed

for the Committee that the union's office was located in the

42

Newman Building in 1963.

While Gay reiterated what he had

told Secret Service agents, that he did not recall

ever

43

seeing Oswald in the building, he told the Committee he

not in the office very much due to frequent business

trips.

He said he did not mingle with the other tenants

45

in the building. Gay believed the union's searetary at

the time, Mrs. Eugenia Donnelly, would have more information

46

about others in the Newman Building.

Subsequent attempts

to locate Donnelly proved futile and she is believed to be

47

deceased.

Unfortunately, she was not questioned by investi-

gating officials following the assassination of President

Kennedy•

(479) Jack Mancuso, owner of Mancuso's Coffee Shop located on

the ground floor of the Newman Building, was interviewed

48

by Committee investigators and

questioned about his

customers.

Mancuso recalled that Guy Banister and his associates Jack

Martin and David Ferrie were "steady" customers, but Mancuso

personally

49

could not recall ever having seen Oswald.

Mancuso was not

interviewed by FBI or Secret Service agents following the

50

assassination.

(480) James Arthus was interviewed by, Secret service agents

immediately following the assassination.

He told the

agents that an unknown man had attempted to rent an office

52

at 544 Camp Street, but that he had discouraged him.

Arthus

could not describe the amn and recommended the agents

speak with "Mrs. Downing", presumed to be Mrs. Donnelly,

since she had also seen the man and could possibly provide

53

a description of him.

As pointed out above, Mrs. Donnelly

was not interviewed by either the Secret Service of the FBI

on this matter. Arthus could not be

interviewed by the

Committee because he died in 1967.

481) The FBI and the Secret Service apparently failed to

question all the occupants of 544 Camp

Street, including

a witness who may have had information

about a man who

had attempted

to rent space there. While the FBI did

speak to Guy Banister, there is no indication from the

report of that interview that Banister was asked any

questions about Oswald. Instead, he was asked about

55

Sergio Arcacha Smith and the Cuban Revolutionary Council.

($2) The overall investigation of the 541 Camp Street issue

at the time of the assassination was not thorough.

It is

not surprising, then, that significant links were never

discovered during the original investigation.

The

Committee concentrated on an investigation of the activities

and individuals in and around the office of Guy Banister,

since this was

the area of the least investigation in

the days following the assassination. Various resources

(486) It was probably a result. of such anti-Castro activities

that Banister became acquainted with David Ferrie. Ferrie,

an Eastern Airlines pilot, was also very active with

6869

Sergio Arcacha Smith's anti-Castro group.

Ferrie shared

5970

Banister's anti-Communist and anti-Castro fervor:

(187) Both Ferrie and Banister were implicated in

a raid in late

1961 against a munitions depot in Houma, Louisiana,

in which

7071

various weapons, grenades and ammunition were stolen.

Banister's role may have been limited to storing the

materièl which was reportedly seen

stacked in Banister's

7172

back room by several witnesses.

Others who actually

participated in the raid, include Andrew Blackmon, a Ferrie

associate and former Civil Air Patrol cadet, and Sergio

Arcacha Smtih.

in fighting his recent dismissal from Eastern Airlines.

Banister investigated the case for Ferrie's defense to

charges brought by the

airline and local New Orleans police

7475

of crimes against nature and extortion.

In exchange,

Ferrie provided Banister research services, such as analysis

75.76

of autopsy reports.

Banister worked with Ferrie's lawyer,

G. Wray Gill, on this matter until its

culmination

in Ferrie's

hearing before

the

Airline Pilot's grievance board in the

summer of 1963.

organized crime head Carlos Marcello on a deportation case.

Little is known of Banister's exact contribution to that

investigation which ended in acquittal on the very day

and almost the very hour that President Kennedy was shot.

451) The long-standing relationship of Ferrie and Banister

is significant since Ferrie became a suspect in the Kennedy

808|

'assassination soon after it had occurred.

The information

to the District Attorney's office that had put the spotlight

8482

on Ferrie had emanated from Banister associate, Jack Martin.

As detailed elsewhere in the report, although Ferrie was

cleared of suspicion in

the assassination during the

original investigation, the Committee found persuasive

evidence of an association between Ferrie and Oswald.

(490) Although Banister was questioned by the fBI following

the assassination in regard to the activities of the CRC

at 544 Camp Street, the FBI and the Secret Service failed

to discover the significance of Banister's connection to

page 12

Banister was

aware of Oswald and his Fair Play for

Cuba Committee before the assassination. Banister's

brother, Ross Banister, who is employed by the Louisiana

State Police, told the Committee that his brother had

mentioned seeing Oswald hand out Fair Play for Cuba

literature on one occasion. Ross Banister theorized

Oswald had used the 544 Camp Street address on his

04

literature to embarass Guy.

Ross Banister did confirm

Guy's interest in the assassination and Oswald, but knew

of no direct association between Oswald and Banister.

(U2) Ivan E. "Bil1" Nitschke, a friend and business associate

and former FBI agent:5

corroborates that Banister was

cognizant of Oswald's leafite distributing.

Nitschke

was deposed by the Committee in July 1978.

He testified

that he had known Banister when they were both in the

FBI and for a short time worked for Banister in the

37

office in the Newman Building.

(193) vitschke said he never saw lee Harvey Oswald at

544 Camp Street and does not know if Banister ever met

8 Muelles

Oswald.

However, Nitschke recalls that Banister became

"interested in Oswald" during the summer of 1963 when

Oswald had been distributing handbills.

Nitschke recalls

Banister had some of these handbills in his office or

90

made reference to them.

From the context of the conversation,

however, he was not pleased.")

(494) Delphine Roberts, Banister's Long-time friend and

secretary, stated to the Committee that Banister had gotten

HH 53080 DocId: 32273595 Page 216

---

## Page 217

544 Camp Street

page 13

very angry with James Arthus and Sam Newman over Oswald's

92

use of the 544 Camp Street address on his handbills.

(495) The Committee questioned Sam Newman regarding

Roberts' allegation. Newman could not recall ever seeing

Oswald or renting space

to him.

He did recall, however,

asking a young man who was in the office once used by the

Cuban Revolutionary Council to leave. Newman did not

think this person was Oswald.

Newman theorized that if

Oswald was using the 544 Camp Street address and had any

link to the building, it would have been through a connection

960

to the Cuban Revolutionary Council or Banister's office.

496) The Committee questioned other individuals once

affiliated with Guy Banister, including: Joseph Newbrough, Verno

Gendes

an investigator who had worked with Banister in 1963; Mary

Helen Brengel, one of two secretaries in Banister's office

from approximately June 1963 to December 1963; Louise

Decker, a secretary in Banister's office for the period

19

from October 1961 to January 1962; Joseph Oster, one time

partner of Banister's who set up his own private detective

100

I agency, Southern Research, in 1958; and Carlos Quiroga,

the Cuban exile who visited Oswald at his home on

approximately August 16, 1963, endeavoring to learn more

198

about the FPCC.

Quiroga told the Committee he frequently

visited Banister's office and Mancuso's coffee shop in

the company of Sergio Arcacha Smith and David Ferrie when

102

all

were heavily involved in Cuban exile activities.

103

this would have been

in 1961 and 1962.

individuals recalled seeing Oswald at 544 Camp Street.

Several witnesses recommended the Committee speak with

Jack Martin of Delphine Roberts since there were in most

contact with Banister.

(497) Martin and roberts have both been interviewed by

the Committee on several occasions.

Roberts, who initially

refused to speak with the Committee staff, told the

Committee she was very active in anti-Communist activities

10g

in the early 1960's.

She said she worked with Banister

as a volunteer typing correspondence, making

files and

clipping newspapers because Banister was working for what

Roberts believed in.

Roberts claimed Banister had

extensive file on Communists and fellow travelers, including

one

Lee Harvey Oswald, which was kept out of the

original files because Banister "never got around to

assigning a number to it! Roberts does not remember what

was in the file other than that it contained general

108

information on Oswald such as newspaper clippings.

Roberts

also related the incident described previously in this

section

in which

Banister became angry over Oswald's use of the

109

Camp. Street address.

Roberts fethersnerated her version of an

incident that took place late in the evening on the day of

the assassination. She said

Jack Martin came into the

office and

approached the area of the office where the

files were kept, when Banister walked ih!

Banister accused

Martin of

stealing several files and hiding them in his coat!!

When Martin protested, Banister pulled out his gun and

HH 53080 DocId:32273595 Page 218

---

## Page 219

544 Camp Street

page 15

110

struck Martin on the head, causing him to bleed..

Both

men then went into Banister's

private office and continued

111,3

their discussion beyond Roberts' earshot.

498) During another interview, Roberts told the committee

that Oswald came into the office seeking employment and

sometime later brought Marina in with him. Contrary to her

statements in the inital interview, that she had never seen

oswald; she stated that she saw oswald come into Bansiter's

office on several occasions..

Because of such contradictions

in Roberts statements to the Committee and lack of independent

corroboration of many of her statements, the Committee

cannot attest to the reliability of her

statementsch hot be daisemined

(499) New orleans police complaint filed by Jack Martin.

òn November 22, 1963 corroborates Roberts' story

insofar

as it established Banister's assault against Jack

Martin with the pistol.

According to the report, Martin

and Banister had been drinking at a bar neighboring the

Newman Building, then visited the Banister's office and

became involved in various discussions about "personal and

political subjects." - They then began to argue about

unauthorized long-distance telephone calls which

Banister

Lie 11ỡ

accused Martin of making from the office.

The discussion

became more heated and Banister pulled out a .357 magnum revolver

and hit Martin on the head four or five times with the

butt of the gun.

When Martin began to bleed, Banister

stopped hitting him and Martin went to the restroom to

(an destig

clean up.

Banister told Martin to watch himself and be

careful.

Martin then went to Charity Hospital for trea

147

returned home and called the police to file the report.

Martin refused to press charges as Banister was "like a

father" to him.

(500) Martin was questioned by the committee regarding the

incident and for information about Banister's office.

Martin told the Committee he is a part-time investigator

122

124

and writer, as he was in the early 1960's. Martin was

one of the members of Banister's investigative "pool"

323/25

was frequently in and out of Banister's offce. Martin

told the Committee that on Nomeber 22, 1963, he was having

176 124

drinks with Banister at a local bar and they got into an argument.

They went to Banister's office and, in the heat of the quarrel,

Banister said something to which Martin replied, "What are

125127

you going to do -- kill me like you all did Kennedy?"

126168

Banister drew his pistol and beat Martin in the head.

Martin

beleives Banister would have killed him but for the intervention

of Banister's secretary, who pleaded with Banister not

127129

to shoot Martin.

(501) It was the day after this incident that Martin related

his suspicions about David Ferrie to the New Orleans

129130

District Attorney's office.

Martin had at one time been

129131

a close associate of Ferrie. Ferrie told the FBI he met

Martin in the fall of 1961, probably not long after Ferrie

13-9. 132

had met Banister.

Martin apparently shared Ferrie's

interest in obtaining a position with an ecclesiastical

order, although Ferrie insisted he became involved with

Ferrie said he and Martin

had a falling out when he put Martin out of attorney

6. Wray Gill's office in June, 1963, because 6321 did

not want Martin "hanging around the office."

Gill said

Ferrie and Martin had been "close friends" until they

got involved in an "ecclesiastical deal wherein Martin

was supposed to represent a large territory of the Holy

133135

Apostolic Catholic Church of North America!'

Martin held

Ferrie responsible for not gettis?, the job and has "slandered

Ferrie at every opportunity."

Martin's previous

statements to authorities

shortly after

the assassination in which Martin made no such allegation

about having

seen oswald, the do maybe assued that

platea

credence in Martin's statements to the Committee.

(503) The committee sought to trace Banister's office files

that had been reportedly scattered to various individuals

or agencies soon after Banister's death in June 1964.

(504) Mary Braister wilsoy fuy Braister's widow, told the

Committee she had not retained any of the files but had

another portion of the file was given to Aaron Kohn of the

New Oreans Metropolitan Crime Commission. i Several books

from Banister's collection went to Banister's associate,

1401470

Kent Courtney.

The rest of Banister's "extensive" library

of books It donated to the Louisiana state university

Library.

(505) 2usse11 Willie and Joseph Cambre of the Louisiana

State police confirmed for the Committee that they purchased

from Mary Banister in late 1964 a five-drawer file

cabinet containing file folders belonging to the late Guy

Banister. The "half-filled" file cabinet contained ten

743/45

large manila folders, each subject titled and numbered.

One of the folders contained a group of 3" by 5" index

M4176

cards.

index cards contained numbers and subject

145147

headings corresponding to the file folders in the cabinet.

Not all the files listed in the index were among those files

given to the Louisiana State Police; most of the files obtained

by the state police dealt with communist groups and subvers tig

organizations, according to State Police Officer Cambre.

Cambre recalled that although Lee Harvey Oswald's name

was not incided among the main subjects of the files, Oswald's

name was

included among the main subjects of the file

1047/449

on the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Cambre had read the

FPCC file and found news clippings and a transcript of a

in which,

had parkopated,

radio program Oswald warren, presumably a transcript of the

August 21, 1963 debate between Oswald and Carlos Bringuier

on WDSU radio.

Unfortunately, this file was routinely

destroyed in keeping with the requirements of the Privacy

Act.

S00) Aaron Kohn, Managing Director of the New Orleans

Matropolitan Crime Commission, acknowledged that he

received files from Mary Banister Wilson after Guy Banister's

death.

The files received by Kohn dealt with

an

investigation of corruption within the New Orleans Police

Department, which Banister had conducted while he

was

Assistant Auperintendent of Police in New Orleans in

the

mid-1950's.

C7) While the Committee was unable to trace or recover

all of Banister's files, a partial index of the files was

made available by Jim Garrison, former District Attorney

152/574

of Orleans Parish, Louisiana. Garrison had sent investigators

to the Louisiana State Police Intelligence Section in 1967

auring his investigation into the assassination of President

Thus, the Committee could find no documentary

proof that Banister had a file on Lee Harvey Oswald

nor could

the Committee find credible witnesses who

ever saw Lee Harvey Oswald and Guy Banister together.

There are indications, however, that Banister at least

knew of Oswald's leafletting activities and probably

maintained a file on him. As for Jack Martin's reasons for

calling attention to Ferrie

as a suspect in the assassination,

IMPLICATIONS

559)

The primary import of the 544 Camp Street address

must be analyzed within the context of evidence of a Ferrie-

Osald link.

Unfortunately, the precise nature of

suet their relationship may never be known.

Ferrie

could have become familiar with Oswald and his background,

habits and motivating factors, and groomed Oswald

for

use in clandestine activity, perhaps initially along

the model of private investigator. MIs can be seen by

the Committee investigation into Ferrie's associations

and activities throughout his life and especially

during

the summer of 1963, there are several factors which

explainwhy Ferrie and Oswald could have become closely

associated, as improbable as this may seem.

611) A)

Both men spent considerable time in the same

locale:

Ferrie frequently visited the office of Guy Banister

in the building at 544 Camp Street,

Oswald worked only

one block

away and had used 544 Camp Street as the address

of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

Additionally, the

Evidence also exists to support the belief that Ferrie's

closest colleague, Guy Banister, was knowledgeable of

Oswald's pro-castro leafletting. edeces honaliste

Both men had

similar, fervent interest in political

topics, especially the Cuban question. Although Ferrie

stood firmly on the anti-Castro side of the issue and

(573)

Strangely, although Ferrie seemed to be straightforward

during his interviews with FBI agents in discussing his

opposition to Kennedy, his conflict with Jack Martin, his

involvement in the Marcello case, etc.,

Ferrie denied outright

that he had ever known

"of the Cuban Revolutionary Front

maintaining

an office at 544 Camp Street, nor does he have

any knowledge of Sergio Arcacha Smith maintaining an office

at that address during the time he-was head of the organization

and later

after he was replaced. "I5T This is clearly in contra-

disction to the accounts of the witnesses on this subject.

HH 53080

## Page 226

Oswald was involved in pro-Castro activities, this alone

would

not rule out the possibility of

an Oswald-Ferrie

association. Oswald, on at least one occasion, made a

friendly overture to a known anti-Castro activitist,

Carlos Bringuier, the New Orleans delegate to the Student

Revolutionary Directorate (DRE) and even offered Bringuier

assistance in military training of Cuban exiles. The

Oswald-Ferrie association may have begun in the same

manner.

14) S4 significant to the argument that Oswald and ferrie

were associated in 1963 is evidence of prior association

in 1955 when Ferrie was Captain of a Civil AIr Patrol

squadron and Oswald a young cadet.

emi Batyahh. This pupil-teacher relationship

could

have greatly facilitated their reacquaintance and Ferrie's

noted ability to influence others could have been

utilized with Oswald.

515) 2) Ferrie's experience with the underground activities

of the Cuban exile movement and as a private investigator

for Carlos Marcello and Guy Banister might have made him

a good candidate to participate in a conspiracy plot.

He may not have been knowledgeable of what was to be the

outcome of his actions, but once the assassination had

been successfully completed and his own name cleared,

Ferrie would have had. no reason to reveal his knowledge

of the plot. Further, fear for his life may have prevented

him from doing

While great gaps exist in discovering whether

Ferrie

N.B.: The

the

inconsistency of the substance of this and certain

elated FBI reports.

DI 44-1639 states only that

Connell said that Odio told her that she knew Oswal

and that he had spoken to groups of refugees in Dallas.

Nothing is noted about a visit of three men.

told a Committee investigator (Fonzi memorandum, op.

cit. p. 3) that she doesn't recall ever telling the

FBI that.

Neither does the FBI report of the Bureau's

initial

interview with Odio on 12/19/63 (report DI 100-10461)

€ does not note Connell's report of her conversation

with her friend, Mrs. Sanford Pick, regarding Ruby's

visiting the law firm where Pick worked.

Connell

said she is positive she told that

to

the FBI.

The

Committee has found that neither Pick nor the attorney

who handled Ruby's case at the law firm were questioned

by the FBI.

(Fonzi memorandum, op. cit. pp. 4-6)

But because neither Pick nor the attorney, Graham R.E.

Koch, could specifically recall Ruby requesting power

of attorney for his sister and because, according to

Koch, his firm's records on the case were later

routinely destroyed (Fonzi memorandum, op. cit),

the Committee was unable to further pursue the possibility.

Eshe was once Castro's mistress (Miami News 6/15/76),

told the Committee she was present at a September 1963

the Hose

meeting in Orlando Bosch's Miami home during which

Lorenz said

„All possible individuals involved in this allegation

were questioned by the Committee with the following

results.

Interviewed on June 16, 1978, Orlando Bosch told the

Committee he had met Lorenz once in 1962 at which time

he was planning

an air raid over Cuba with Alexander

Rorke.

Lorenz later called him and said she wanted to

get involved in anti-Castro activities, but Bosch

turned her down and never saw her again.

He further

stated he had never travelled west of New Orleans in

his life.

In a March 21, 1978 deposition in Miami, Florida, Jerry

Patrick Hemming responded negatively to

the questions:

"Did you ever drive from Miami to Dallas with Marita

Or Frank Sturgis? Or a man identifying himself

as 'Ozzie'?" (pp. 170-71)

Immunized testimony was received in Washington, D.C. on

April 28, 1978 from Pedro Diaz Lanz, Who denied Lorenz's

allegation, (p. 64) and explained his whereabouts on

November 22, 1963 (p. 65).

In a March 20, 1978 deposition in Miami, Frank A. Sturgis

asked if he did, "

in the company of

Marita Lorenz,

Leon Oswald and others. drive from Miami

to Dallas a day

or to before the assassination?"

Sturgis responded:

"Sir, that is an
