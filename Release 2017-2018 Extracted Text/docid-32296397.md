It appears there is a possibility to obtain techni-

cal coverage by utilizing the REMT as outline in no number SAC

letter 61-F. The Bureau has previouslyauthorized a survey and,

if possible, Installation at 902 South 8th Street. During the

prior Bureau-authorized survey, the following information was

obtained:

On the first floor immediately behind the barber shop is the

kitchen used by the MAIORIELLO family. It is in this location

that BRUNO 1s known to frequently meet with his underboss and

other La Cosa Nostra members. It is definitely believed that

this telephone in the kitchen is a 300 series telephone. There

are multiples of the telephone used by ALPHONSE MAIORIELLO at

906 South 8th Street (8th pair) and 801 Washington Avenue (7th

pair). 906 South 8th Street would, of course, be two doors

away from the target address.

Washington Avenue would be

two blocks from the target address.

The exchange servicing

the telephone number at the target address, MA 7-6443, is located at

9th and Race Streets, Philadelphia, which is approximately three

miles from the target area.

Located within a three-block area of the target

address are three separate parochial institutions. The second

telephone instrument used by MAIORIELLO is of an unknown descrip-

tion and is belleved to be in his second floor apartment.

It is known that a multiple of MAIORIELLO's pair

number can be moved to any desired location through contacts

with the telephone company source in Philadelphia.

It is emphasized here that the above information

was obtained during the previous Bureau-authorized survey as

described above.

It is requested that the Bureau advise if they

POSTED

would authorize a further survey and possible installation

utilizing the RFMT unit. If this survey is authorized, ap-

propriate FD-142 will be forwarded to the Bureau. It the sur-

vey is authorized, technical information will be needed by the

Philadelphia Office to guide them. It is not known for example,

how close installment is needed to successfully activate the

subscriber's instrument for a misur with the use of RENT Unit.

Philadelphia, through contacts, can probably ob-

tain a secluded area accessible only to Bureau personnel in a

parochial Institution within a three-block radius of the target

instrument.

The closest parochial institution is approximately

one-block distance from the target address.

•It is belleved the

parochial institution would afford the best security avallable

in this particular situation.

It is not believed that prosecution of any sub-

stantive case would be affected by the use of this contemplated

source. The source would be for intelligence purposes.

Bureau, if survey authorized, is requested to

suairtel and include specific technical instructions that

need to be met to complete survey in this matter.
