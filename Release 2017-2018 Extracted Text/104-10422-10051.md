MEXICO ANGLE

I. TELTAP - LIENVOY - delete all mention of teltap

Sylvia DURIN - secretary in Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

She was one

Oswald contacted to apply for Cuban visa. Her name

came to our attention & the Mex. Gov's via the teltap.

All into about DuRav which was published in the larren

Report was provided the Commission by the lex. Gov. via

State Dept.

CIA was never tied in publicly to DURAN

LA Division wishes to withhold mention of DURAN because

the ultimate source in identifying her contact with Oswald

was the teltap.

II.

Gilberto ALVARADO Uguarte - Nicaraguan who & walked into the American

An Embassy in Mexico after the assassination claiming he had knowledge

of the matter.

Claimed Oswald had received $ from a Cuban at the

Cuban Embassy. Turned out thru tracing

that ALVARADO was an agent

for the Nicaraguan Intel Service.

However, Alvarado's story was

only his invention and had nothing to do with Nic. Intel.

Alvarado's

sat story does appear in the Warren Report but his

identity is

withheld.

Leave in info re ALVARADO but delete his identity including

citizenship & also delete identity of Nicaraguan service.

III. Photo of "Unidentified Man' - may leave in fact that photo was

taken in Mexico in front of Sov Embassy, but do not vant

to imply that photo surveillance was being conducted.

Therefore must protect source.

FYI: crypts that appear in Mexico traffic

LIMITED - Mex. photo surveillance

LILYRIC - technical surveillance op.

LIFIRE - travel manifests,

airport surveillance
