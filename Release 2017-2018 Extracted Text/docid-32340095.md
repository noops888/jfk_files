gambling activilies-Bahamas Islanie

You

will recall that on 30th December, 1966, I forwarded

to yoù a memorandum based on information received from the Bahamas

Police (Special Branch - Supt. Gregory Bentley in charge) via

my Headquarters as well as from my opposite number in Jamaica.

2.

As paragraph 7 thereof indicates,

we were most anxious

that no action be taken by you to prejudice either the source

or subsequent investigation in the Bahamas; we are grateful

for your co-operation in this respect.

We did, however, ask

you to let us have details of any records you had relating to

those mentioned in the report.

Such records as were available

you kindly forwarded to us on 5th January, and since that time

I have made oral requests for further information relating to

MCLANEY, and for a further attempt to be made to check the name

566856

CLASSIFIED BY

DECLASSIFY ON: 25X

D3

As indicated at the time, the material I passed to

you

emanated from a source whose reliability had then to be

established; the same state of uncertainty regarding the source

pertains today.

As you will appreciate, the report as it

stands indicates that the P.L.P. in their recent election

campaign in the Bahamas expected to derive appreciable assistance

from the u.S. contacts named in the report, some of whom (such

as PROBINSKI seem to be concerned unexceptionally with the

Civil Rights movement and others, such as Michael MCLANEY

perhaps with organised crime syndicates.

In the event, the

election passed off without violence, but this may have

been

due more to the fact that the P.L.P. (unexpectedly) won the

election than to any other factor; even though the allegations

GADR 7/20/35

of arms trafficking made in the report cannot be confirmed,

there

is reason to believe (based on what the F.B.I. Field Office in

Miami has passed to the Bahamas Police in recent months - para

of my note

refers) that the P.L.P. (if so disposed) could have

laid their hands on sufficient firearms to make their point.

4.

• The result of the elections was that the P.L.P. came to

power, and L.0. PINDLING (para 2(d) of my note) is now Prime

Declassify

Minister.

While investigations in the Bahamas have by no

means confirmed the entire story as recorded in my letter of

30th December, it is nevertheless a fact that since the

election

MCLANEY has been seen in and around a Bahamian Minister's office

and-this naturally gives rise to concern on the part of the

Governor and also the Commonwealth Office in London as to the

extent to which those named in my note of 30th December, may

havelycceeded in ingratiating themselves with the P.L.P.

Leaders for purposes which,

to say the least, are most unlikely

to be conducive to good government.

5 .:

The question of the extent to which Mr. PINDLING and

his ministers should be advised against maintaining associations

with undesirable clients such as MCLANEY not only raises

problems of dissemination, but also (and perhaps even more

important) the extent to which it would be wise to base an

approach solely on the contents of the unconfirmed report sent

to you on 30th December.

6.

If I may say so, my own view has been from the outset

that your expert assistance should have been enlisted in an

attempt to get to the bottom of this report, particularly

as it contains suggestions that U.s. citizens may have been

engaged in unlawful activities within your jurisdiction.

am glad to say that this view has now been accepted; accordingly

I have been instructed to approach you on behalf of

the British

Government departments concerned, as well as my own Service,

and to request that you would be

so good as to consider mounting

an investigation of those named in the report, including the

interviewing (where possible) of those concerned, with a view

to assisting us to determine its reliability.

7:

In an attachment to this letter, I attach additional

information relevant to the original report which I have re-

ceived from the Bahamas, and. may I say not only how much your

collaboration at this stage would be welcomed by us, but

also that my services are

always at your disposal, should

clarification of any point be required.

8.

In view of the delicacy of the matter under reference,

we have been at pains throughout to avoid publicity of any kind,

and for this reason none of the suspects have been questioned

in the Bahamas itself.

You should know that the source of the

report in question was in lact James HAWTHORNE!

and while we

see no reason why he should not be questioned in due course, we

do venture to suggest that care should be taken to avoid

giving him any reason to think that you are aware of his role

as a source of Special Branch Bahamas, and that perhaps he

should not be approached until after some of the others con-

cerned have been seen,

and have provided (at least notionally)

collateral on which to base the approach to HAWTHORNE himself.

I believe that at the moment HAWTHORNE, MCLANEY and PROBINSKI

are all in the Bahamas.

9.

Since drafting the above, I have also heard that on

6th February, a Mr. Peloquin of

visited the Bahamas, and indeed spoke to Mr. PINDLING about

the undesirable aspects of the characters of MCLANEY (whom he

said was

'in trouble' with the Internal Revenue service,:

PROBINSKI (a bankrupt, who had kept a house of prostitution),

and one 'Tex' MCCRARY, whom Mr. Peloquin said had been in

touch with him last week in Washington, and had indicated that

Mr. PINDLING wished to have information about McLANEY and

PROBINSKI. As a result of his visit to the Bahamas, Mr.

Peloquin has agreed to supply full dossiers on MCLANEY,

PROBINSKI, MCCRARY and CHESIER to the Governor, through the .

Consul General.

10.

Mr. Peloquin is no doubt keeping you informed of his

interest in this matter, although I myself dia not hear of his

plan to go to Nassau until after he had returnea.

I under-

stand that Mr. Peloquin is aware of my contacts with you on

this matter; I accept that he may well be in a position to

supply the Bahamas with information from U.S. agencies other

than

• the F.B.I.

(with which I have no contact) but notwithstanding

what Mr. Peloquin may have on record, and the channel to the

Bahamas he has established (through the U.S. Consul General)

it still seems

to me to be right to present you now with all

the facts as I know them, and to invite you to pursue some

active enquiries in order to get to the bottom of the

'HAWTHORNE' story.

James Russell HAWTHORNE LOU POLLAR

Subject of your memorandum 15402 dated January 1967;

this indicates

, that he has an extensive record of violent crime.

Introduced to Special Branch Bahamas, through Roy

SOLOMON, former Minister for Communications and Works in U.B.P.

government defeated at January 1967 elections.

Apparent motive

for coming forward was desire to be on the right side in the

event of trouble, and to gain standing with U.B.P. in hope of

obtaining new gambling concession.

Early in January 1967, HAWTHORNE claimed to have been to

Geneva to collect a letter of credit from the Exchange and

Investment Bank, 15 Pierre Fatis, and to have handed this over to

Mone IouiSXPOLIAR, who was it seems to have been some kind of

contact man

with access to supplies of arms in Brussels, which

would be shipped later to the Bahamas (possibly Treasure Cay)

via Antwerp.

POLLAR, according to HAWTHORNE refused the letter

of credit,

and added that in any case no arms were available in

Belgium because stocks had been bought up by King Hussein of

Jordan.

Enquiries in Switzerland revealed that the Exchange and

Investment Bank was

established in 1959, and moved to Geneva in

1966:

There are six Swiss directors, and one American.

The

latter is Benjamin, WHEELER Of Miami - your memorandum 15403 of

4th January refers.

No trace could be found in Swiss records

Of either HAWTHORNE or POLLAR having been in Switzerland up to

6th January, but on 9th January, it was reported that LOU POLLAR,..

an American citizen with large sums at his disposal was due to

arrive

there that day; in fact he did not arrive.

In the

meantime a check had been made of Belgium immigration records

for details of any visit there (December/January 1967) by

HAWTHORNE, with negative results.

At this stage, an opportunity was taken of questioning

HAWTHORNE about his movements with a view to verifying the

story he gave as at paragraph 3 above.

On 7th January, he

claimed to have flown to Europe from Nassau on 19th December

accompanied by an English girl, whom he had met in Bahamas on

16th December, and went straight to Geneva; he claims to have

returned from Europe to Nassau on 4th January 1967, via Bermuda

and Miami®

It is confirmed that HAWTHORNE was in

fact a

passenger'

to London on BOAC Flight BA 672 from Nassau on 19th

December.

There is no record of any onward journey from

London on HAWTHORNE's part.

HAWTHORNE alleged that he stayed

in London at the Carlton Towers Hotel; the result of a check on

this statement is awaited from London.

6.

It is not without interest that HAWTHORNE is the subject

of an exclusion order in London; he clearly slipped through the

Immigration control at London Airport; Furthermore, according

to Interpol, he was sentenced to two years imprisonment in

on was sentenced

absentia in

1961 for fraud.

He married a Belgian girl in London

in December 1960.

7°

HAWTHORNE aIso alleges that when in London in December/

January 1967 he saw "quite a lot" of a man named WESTON "a

person of substance and high level contacts".

He added that

WESTON had had a very satisfactory interview

with Wallace GROVES

in Freeport, Bahamas involving a land transaction worth 12z million

dollars.

WESTON has not yet been identified.

HAWTHORNE also said on 7th January, that the arms dealer

he had met in Geneva was not POLLAR after all,

but an unnamed

West German; it was this man who refused to do business with him.

He told Special Branch Bahamas that he (HAWTHORNE) would be

seeing MCLANEY for frank instructions on 7th January (i.e.

prior to the Bahamas elections).

9.

Regarding LOU POLLAR referred to above, a delicate source

reports that a U.S. citizen named Lou POLLER who lives in Miami,

is an even larger shareholder of the Exchange and Investment Bank

of Geneva than Benjamin WHEELER.

It was this man who was due

to reach Geneva on 9th January, but did not arrive; WHRELER

informed the Bank of POLLER's delay by telephone.

POLLER iS

said to have two addresses in Miami - one being

Biscayne Avenue,

and the other Ireland Terrace, Corablue (? sic). It is believed

by those concerned with the bank in switzerland, that POLLER is

a man undoubtedly capable of any shady deal. Have you any

record of POLLER please?

Subject of your memorandum No. 15400 dated 5th January

1967.

It is reported that since the recent advent of power of

the P.L.P. MCLANEY, is a,

frequent visitor to the Ministry of

Tourism office, and is negotiating for a lease in his own name

of offices to be used by the P.I.P. in Bay Street, Nassau.

One Of MCLANEY's associates

in Nassau who has been seen

visiting Mr. PINDLING'S Office is Samuel RICE,

described as an

attorney from Florida (Fortlauderdale); he is

known to act for

Samuel BENTON who has been declared a prohibited immigrant in

the Bahamas (see also your memorandum No.15401 dated 4th January

1967).

Have you any record of this man please?

I apologise

for the dearth of personal particulars.

4.

RICE arranged for the following aircraft to be mäde

available for use by the P.L.P. in its election campaign:-

(a)

Cessna 206 - N 3436 I - piloted by one Len ROSSMAN,

carrying credit card in name of Meray CaroL/BRAZIE

c/o American Aviation Corporation, Tameana

( c)

Helicopter belonging to Adventure Helicopter

Corporation piloted by one Paul WOODS.

5.

Regarding paragraph 4, one HarolaXENSEN, a U.S. aircraft

pilot who has beén living in the Bahamas for some years,

he has been employed by

the Bahamas Tractor and Equipment, Co.

Ltd., told Special Branch that prior to the elections a pilot

friend of his who works for the Crescent (?) Aircraft Company

of Fort Lauderdale,

had told him of an approach by a man named

William SKILLINGS (owner of a Port Lauderdale public relations

firm and at one time P.R.O. at Riley Aeronautics). This

approach had to do with hiring a helicopter for use by the P.L.P.

subsegnently there was a meeting attended by SKILLINGs and sam

RICE (see above), PINDLING, John Ward EVANS, Vice President o1

Riley Aeronautice who lives at 9941 S.W. 66
