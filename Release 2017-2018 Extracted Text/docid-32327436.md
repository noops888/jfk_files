Mr. REED COZART was contacted on February 8;

1961 for information concerning SNYDER.

At that time,

COZART advised that SNYDER had contacted him at his officâ‚¬

sometime in the latter part of January, 1961. During this

contact, SNYDER discussed two individuals by the names of

PERIERA

and BRADING. COZART stated that SNYDER gave him

the impression that

he was a big shot in San Diego who was

working on a deal to redaim desert land in Nevada. The

above two individuals were to be instrumental in completing

the deal to reclaim this land,

and it was absolutely essential

that they be released from their parole to travel extensively

in the west In order to complete this deal.

COZART stated he had furnished SNYDER certain

papers to be filled out by PERIERA and BRADING.

These papers

were applications for Executive Clemency. SNYDER airmailed

these papers to PERIERA and BRADING and approximately three

days later brought them to COZART's office. COZART stated

that he is a Pardon Attorney in the U. S. Department of

Justice and acts on Executive Clemency Appeals, however,

he flatly denied the appeals from PERIERA and BRADING and

told SNYDER that these two individuals would have to seek

relief from their local parole officers and that his office

could not help them.
