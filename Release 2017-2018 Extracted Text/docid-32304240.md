Date- 4/15/69

On April 3, 1969, EMILIO ECHARTE PEDROSO read and

signed a Rights Waiver form printed in Spanish.

He was then

interviewed in English by Special Agents FRANCIS I. LUNDQUIST

and JOSEPH T. CORRIGAN who identified

themselves to him as Special

Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). ECHARTE

then voluntarily furnished the

following information:

After ECHARTE and his companions fled Cuba in the boat,

"Leda"

, they encountered an English ship about 27 miles off the Florida

coast.

They were

taken aboard this vessel and the United States

Coast Guard was notified. Soon thereafter, the United States Coast

Guard removed ECHARTE and his companions and took them ashore.

ECHARTE's boat,

"Leda", was

towed

into Key West, Florida, and

ECHARTE subsequently sold it for $1,000.

Fea Cula

Almost immediately after ECHARTE arrived in Miami, he

placed a telephone call to PEDROZSANTIESTEBAN who was then working

in a garage.

The garage telephone number was located through a

-telephone directory.

ECHARTE took a taxi to the garage, business

name unrecalled, and SANTIESTEBAN toOk ECHARTE to the building next

door which was 729½ North

Miami Avenue, and

assisted ECHARTE in

arranging to rent a room in that building.

Shortly thereafter, ECHARTE telephoned his mother and OLGA.

PEREZ VALLE, his mistress, in Cuba, and advised them of the address
