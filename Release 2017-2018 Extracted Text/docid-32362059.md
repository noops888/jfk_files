"28 December 1967

SUBJECT:

HEMMING, Gerald Patrick

aka Jerry PATRICK

(See also LABORDE, Lawrence J.)

ALLEGATION:

Gerald Patrick HEMMING, ex-

Marine, soldier-of-fartune,

was head

of an anti-CASTRO group called Inter-

continental Pentration Force (INTERPEN).

He was acquainted with Lawrence J.

which allegedly shows people standing be-

hind a fence on the grassy knoll overlooking

Dealey Plaza.

people in the photograph.

HAMMING also went to GARRISON's office

on 8 July 1967 claiming that he was working

for an unidentified magazine and wanted to

get information for a story on the

GARRISON investigation.

SECRET

The WASHINGTON DAILY NEWS for 6 July 1961 contained an

article concerning a Joseph Patrick HEMMING, leader of an anti-

CASTRO group called Intercontinental Penetration Force (INTERPEN)

who was identified as Subject.

Os file on INTERPEN shows no Agency

connection.

Rather, it was investigated by the FBI in July 1961

for possible violation of U.:S. neutrality laws.

In February 1962. HEMMING was the subject of a Los Angeles

Field Office investigation. The Los Angeles Sheriff's office had

recovered a U. S. pistol from a car in the area on 30 January 1962.

HAMMING appeared at the Sheriff's office to claim the pistol stating

that he was a CIA agent on a training mission in connection with a

Cuban assignment. HAMMING was interviewed by the Los Angeles Contact

Office concerning the incident, and according to the interviewer,

Subject never claimed to have worked for the CIA. He had furnished

certain information concerning activities in Cuba in the form of

reports to the Los Angeles Contact Office since approximately

October 1960.

Of particular note in subject's file is a copy of an article

by one Bill STUCKEY entitled "Anti-Castro Base Near Covington" which

appeared in the New Orleans STATES-ITEM for 21 July 1962 (copy attached).

It concerned Subject described as an American soldier-of-fortune,

Gerald Patrick HEMMING. aka Jerry PATRICK, who showed up in New Orleans

in February 1962 "apparently at the invitation of local Cuban Revolu-

tionary Council leaders and other Cubans who wanted to take direct

against CASTRO. With the help of anonymous U. S. patrons, the

Cubans began supplying PATRICK with machine guns, exposives and

other military supplies.

"PATRICK made regular trips here (New Orleans), slipping in

and out of the port secretly in a modern, well-equipped PI boat.

"Last spring (1962) another anonymous U. S. patron offered

the Cubans and PATRICK a large tract of land - complete with air strip

on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. PATRICK agreed to set up a

training base, handling classes of 50 or so Cuban recruits at a time.

After completion of the training,

the guerrillas would be like their

Everglades counterparts, transported to Cuba secretly to work with

the anti-CASTRO underground."

The article then states that the Miami Cuban Revolutionary

Council "nixed" the Covington base for undescribed reasons.

The article further states that although the "PATRICK"

guerrilla base plan fell through, the New Orleans STATES-ITEM con-

firmed in April 1962 that "Cubans were trained here (New Orleans)

at the old Algiers ammunition dump, for the Bay of Pigs invasion."

(This was the Agency training locale - not Lake Pontchartrain as

alleged by GARRISON).
