20 February 1998

The Honorable John R. Tunheim

United States District Court

300 South Fourth Street

Minneapolis, MN

55415

Via FAX: (612) 664-5087

Dear Judge Tunheim:

Ed Cohen and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with

you and Mr. Gunn to discuss ways

this Agency can facilitate

the important work of the Assassination Records Review

Board.

As I hope was clear, our new Office of Information

Management

is committed to ensuring that withholding

determinations or postponement requests are made

thoughtfully and only in the most compelling circumstances.

Turning to a particular matter we discussed, you will

recall that we offered to explore any avenues that might be

open to facilitate the Board's access to relevant Russian

and Belarus records. Based on discussions with senior

officials at the Department of Defense, we suggest that you

contact Senator Robert (Bob) Smith (N.H.) who is a member of

the Joint US-Russian POW/MIA Commission, which is also known

as the Ambassador Toon Commission. He may be reached at:

ROOm 307

Dirkson Senate Office Building

Washington, D.C.

20510

(202) 224-2841

In particular, we understand that the former head of the KGB

(Primakov) will be visiting Washington in the near future

and perhaps Senator Smith could intercede on your behalf

and/or arrange an audience.

The Honorable John R. Tunheim

Please be assured that we will continue to look for any

other leads in this regard although I believe that Senator

Smith

may be the most likely source for assistance.

Please let me know if there should be any questions.

I may be reached at

(703). 613-1289.

Sincerely yours,

rickland
