Enclosed for Legat, Ottawa, is a copy of New York

letter to the Bureau 12/23/64, captioned "NY 4498-C-TE, Tog

Echelon Criminal Informant Program."

Enclosed letter deals

with a trip NY 4498-C-TE made to Montreal recently, where he

was in touch with individuals either operating as part of,

or associated with, members of Lia Cosa Nostra in Montreal.

Information has been developed from a number of

highly confidential sources in positions to report on high

level La Cosa Nostra activity that there is a membership

group of La Cosa Nostra in Montreal, which over the years

operated as part of the New York "family" headed by "Commission"

member Joseph Bonanno.

Background regarding the nature and national make-up

of this criminal organization is contained in past copies of

the Criminal Intelligence Digest, which have been furnished to

you.

The enclosed New York letter is for your information

and guidance in dealing with authorities in the Montreal area.

A letterhead memorandum is now being prepared by the New York

Office summarizing information developed to date regarding the

existence of La Cosa Nostra in Montreal. This will be

furnished to you for dissemination to the RCMP and for your

assistance in developing our intelligence picture of this

organization as it operates in Canada, with particular emphasis

on the relationships between

the members in both countries.
