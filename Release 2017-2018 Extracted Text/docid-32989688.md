Dear Friends,

Fox: the past two years anti-var activities have becone more widesmie:!

in the Southwest.

Local WRL's have grown rapidly.

#onviolence has beer

at the root of these developments. ilost of our understanding of

nonviolence came not so nuch from training sessions or speakers but

has develoned out of our own needs and concerns. Mow nonviolence has

become the prime movei of change in the Southwest and there is a strong

desire for botter communications, a better sharing of experiences.

The Southwest is unique because it has no "leaders" or "movement

heavies" hut a loi of good people with experience in lots of different

areas. •

Thanksgiving weekend ve will come together to share our selves and our

community.

People from Institute/Mt. West, GI's for Peace (El Pasa),

Direct Action/MNL Austin, AFSC San Antonio and Pasadena, Peacemakers,

We-lest & southwest, farmorker support comittees, gay liberation,

and many more will come to share ideas about continuing to build the

nonviolent movement in the Southwest. Please come and join with us

in a weckond for creative change. Write or call foi information.

AQ I-3 advised that the three principal topics of

discussion during this conference were:

I. The increased use of non-violence by individual

groups to bring about social change.

2. The building of alternative life styles.

3. Local and community organizing.

Source also advised that the following additional topics

were also discussed at various times during the conference:

Non-cooperation with the courts, draft and tax

resistance and organizing the military.

AQ I-3 advised that for the most part, those participating

in the conference broke down into small groups to discuss the

above topics and the problems caused by U. S. military involvement

in Southeastern Asia repeatedly came up during these discussions.

During the conference, James Newton, a member of the

American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) presented a slide

showing dealing with the increased use of automation in warfare.

These slides included photographs of advanced tracking and sur-

veillance systems and other uses of electronic equipment by the

military.

Following the showing of the slides, Newton stressed

that individuals involved in the peace movement should attempt

to infiltrate companies which design and produce this type c:

equipment and should also advise the business community to

pressure the Government to reduce defense spending in order :-

reduce the producing of weapons of war.

Newton indicated tha:

the slides

had been prepared by the National Action Research

on the Military-Industrial Complex.

According to the September, 1970, issue of

"Peace News,"

a publication

of the AFSC, the

AFSC is a "non-profit organization organized

and directed by members of the Society of

Friends (Quakers) and founded by both

Quakers and non-Quakers.

It seeks solutions

to domestic and international problems

through non-violent means."

an outline for Southern Californians

Introduction

This step-by-step outline is a tool southern Californians can use to disco:er

the extent of military influence in a local community and acquire the infor-

mation necessary to design an action project to reduce that influence.

In 1970, military and defense-related expenditures accounted for 64% of the

$167 billion voted by Congress, 1

The Pentagon owns 29 million acres of land

(an area almost as big as New York state), and the Army Civil Works division

1 addition to work done in Government

laboratories, defense agencies pay for more than half of the research under-

taken in industrial laboratories and about three-fifths of the work performed

by universities and other nonprofit institutions. 3 The Pentagon has contracts

ard installations in 363 of the 435 congressional districts, and in all 50

There are 22,000 prime contractors (subcontractors are too numerous

to mention), and 90% of all weapons procurement is done by negotiations rather

than competitive bidding. 5 Decisions made by Pentagon planners and war

contractors affect all of us directly, and virtually every U.S. community of

an size is in some way dependent on military spending.

Here in southern California, hundreds of thousands of our citizens are so

dependent on military spending that they would face economic disaster it

peace should break out. Already, aerospace cutbacks have left tens of

thousands bitter and jobless.

At the same time, our lactories produce vast

quantities of the weapons that now kill people in Aisa, Africa and Latin

America.

The fact is that southern California is one of the nation's leading

areas in per capita war contract dollars, and that fact gives southern Cali-

fornia peace activists a special responsibility.

Increasingly, peace activists grow interested in projects aimed at ending

weapons production by a given company or encouraging the business community to

press the government to reduce war spending and initiate constructive programs.

such projects require careful preparation.

The military-industrial complex is just that--highly complex. Research

guides often seem complex, too.

But don't be put off. Non-experts can

spend a few hours looking in the right places and turn up a great deal of

accurate, useful information.

The research materials and books referred to

in this outline are available from the American Friends Service Committee's

bookroom in Pasadena. People from the resource groups listed at the end of

the outline can help you understand the materials, plan your research, and

Launch your local action project.

nun your telephone directory under "U.S. Government." In the Los Angolas

area,

the General Services Administration publishes a U.S. Government telephone

directory that lists names and addresses of many Defense Department (DOD)

officials (call GSA's Communications Division, area code 213, 688-3217 and

ask how to get the directory).

b) NACLA's Research l'ethodology Guide, pp. 26-28, tells you where to look

for information on military locations, military think-tanks, books on under-

standing the military, military associations and military publications.

c) Vets and

active-duty GI's can tell you a lot.

d) Military organizations usually have public affairs officers. Call for an

appointment. You'll receive information that gives the piature as the organi-

zation wants the public to see it.

II.

Finding war contractors

a) In industrial directory is usually available for a few dollars from the

Chamber of Commerce. The directory lists names, addresses and nature of

business for most of the city's firms, and some directories give the number

of employees.

Possible war contractors

are listed under such titles as

aircraft supplies, engineering contractors, electronics, research and de-

velopment, optics.

b) A list of prime contractors with more than $100,000 in DoD contracts,

providing name and address of firm and nature of items produced for DoD, is

available free on request from:

Defense Contract Administration Services Region,

Los Angeles

Small Business Office

11099 S. La Cienega Blvd.

Los Angeles, Ca. 90045

c) See NACIA's RMG, p. 30, for other sources of information on your local

defense contractors.

und To supplement information from the above sources, interview college and

junior college faculty in the departments-of economics, urban planning,

sociology and government, and visit the Chamber of Commerce staff and officers:.

III. Securing contract information

a) The Government Contracts Directory, and the Research and Development

Directory, both published by Government

Data Publications, Inc., list contracts

by company, awarding agency and product.

They indicate contract number,

dollar value of'contract, specific site where work is done, and nature of the

These directories

are in the Caltech library.

commerce Business

Daily, a publication of the U.S.

lept. of Commerce,

Iists contract awards on a day-to-day basis and is a good source of very

recent information. Available in most city or college libraries.

c) The lall Street Journal Index lists most contract awards by company name.

Available in most large libraries (including the Pasadena City Library). :

d) The Defense Industry Bulletin, published by the Assistant Secretary of

Defense for Public Affairs, has cumulative monthly lists of DoD contracts

over $l million, Available in Caltech library.

e)

Selected information on specific contractors is available from NAMIC,

American Friends Service Committee, 160 N. Fifteenth St., Philadelphia, Pa.

19102.

NARMIC gets lots of requests for help, so it's good to try local

resource groups before calling on NArMIC.

IV. Analyzing selected companies.

At this point, you know the locations of many military agencies

facilities

in your town. You have a list of businesses with var contracts?

and you have specifics on contracts held by those firms that interest you most.

Now you will probably select several firms that exercise substantial power in

the area or make a particularly brutal product and consider initiating pro-

jects to change one or more of these selected firms. You need to know who runs

a company, how the company relates to other firms (interlocking directorates,

trade arrangements, subcontracts), what the company makes that could be affected

through consumer pressure, how the company is organized, its working conditions

and hiring policies, and more.

a) Companies that issue 'stock publish shareholders' reports prior to the l'

annual shareholders' meeting, and they publish a prospectus before a new

issue of stock is made. These documents list the company's directors and their

salaries, detail the nature of items produced, list subsidiary companies

owned and their products, and provide other very useful information.

Caution:

these are essentially public relations papers and may be deceptively worded.

For example, two years ago a shareholders' report issued by the nation's

64th largest war contractor did not mention that the firm did business with

the Pentagon. To get shareholders' reports or a stock prospectus, write

to the company or ask your local stock broker.

b) NACIA'S RiG provides excellent suggestions, as follows:

pp. 17-18, sources of information on the production and financial structure

of corporations, and guides to business sources and suggestions on method-

Ology.

p. 14, how to discover directors, officers and interlocking relations

with other firms, and stock ownership and control data.

pp. 6-9, sources of information on the individuals who own and manage

corporations--their links with government and political matters, involvement

in civic affairs. voluntary organizations and church affiliation.

,it all wor

mike the best use dethe facts you now have at your & bposal, you'll need

no build a basic understanding of corporate practices, Defense Department

policies, military projects, and practices and procedures related to contract

bidding and negotiating.

a) NACIA's RIG, pp. 15-17, lists sources that explain business practices and

describe governmental regulatory agencies.

b) NACIA'S RIG, pp. 27-28, guides you to information on DOD posture and

strategy, military treaties, and hearings.

c). Scan the literature items listed at the end of this outline until you

find what you need.

d) Look in your library card catalog under "Defense contracting" and "Gov-

ernment contracting" for books the war contractors use to shed light on pro-

cedures they must follow.

VI. Initiating the action project

The action project you design should reflect your assessment of the needs of

your comnunity and the political atmosphere there, your understanding of the

role of the company and/or military facility you decide to focus on, the

viewpoints and ethics of your group, and your group's resources. The strategy.

you develop should express your goals and program very clearly and precisely.

In conclusion, it is well to emphasize that the great power of

the military-

industrial complex does not make the complex invulnerable.

On the contrary,

the more complicated and specialized a system of organizations becomes, the

more vulnerable it is to carefully applied pressures and encouragements.

Projects conducted by a very small number of people can have real influence

on major corporations.

Committeed people with clear heads and accurate infor-

mation can transform a power structure!

also be applicable in other times and places.

The ilovember 9 demonstrations are particularly important for another reason. on

This project has be.

explained in previous mailings.

Essentially it involves 300 persons per day committin;

•Our demonstrations at the Republican fund-raising dinners will call attention

to what's happening in Washington and make the point that no matter where he goes Nixon

cannot avoid being reminded of this murderous work.

StInter

In building an election year strategy the antiwar movement needs to bear in mind that

there is good rcason for removing Nixon from the white louse.

First he has an historical

position on Indochina that dates back to 1954 when he advocated using nuclear vicapons to

save the French colonial war effort.. Second, he has succeeded in making Indochina his

var. The Democrats are now free to attack the war and lixon on a partisan basis.

Nevertheless, if the Democrats are going to make ending the war a plank of their cam-

paign it will be only because we make the issue important and keep it in the forefront.

Since both political parties represent essentially the same class in our society many

Denocrats would like to forget the war as

an issue. It's only by making it plain that

ally President who continues the war will be driven

from office are we going to have

either political party put forward a plank that calls for a complete end to the war.

¿ixon, up 'til now, has been very successful in defusing the war issue. That's partly

occause the two major slogans of the antiwar movement, "Set the Date for Total "1th-

drawal" and "Out ilow" have equated ending the war with ending the American ground corbai

role and American casualties.

The war does not end until there are no more casualties

an any side in Indochina and doesn't happen until the liS ends support of the Thieu

dictatorship, removes all men and materiel, ends the bombing, exchanges prisoners and :

allows seli detemmination for all of Indochina.

In our demonstrations we should therefore 1) concentrate in the war as Nixon's war (by

this we mean not that his adrinistration is responsible totally for creating the wai

jut he aid his administration is responsible for letting the war continue) and aim our

antivar actions at him and members of his administration, and 2) educate peoble yo..une

ract that ending the war means more than ending U.S. casualties. For the first objec-

tive we suggest demonstrations such as the one outlined in this paper.

For the second

objective le suggest you not talk about the war in simlistic slogans but use the PRG

seven point program for ending the war (up 'til December 31, 1971 when it expires) and

ine Peoples Peace Treaty as ways of explaining

how to really end the wat.

Tactics

The situntion calls for reminding the Republican contributers at the dinner of their

responsibility for the continuing slaughter in Indochina.

Further, the message to the

general public through direct observation and the news media should emphasize the con

tinuing war in indochina and continuing deaths of Indochanese (estimated at 300 per day

in Vietnam alone).

Ile suggest a modified guerilla theater demonstration. Participants should be organized

to participate as actors in the theatre. A supporting rally type demonstration or

picket line should be set up for those not wanting to participate in the theatre.

Spectre of Death

lave people dress up in black cloaks with white pancake makeup on their faces. As many

as possible should wander slowly and aimlessly around the entrance to the Dinner.

They

should have signs hanging from their necks with a single theme.

For instance, ore theme

could be genocide with each spectre having a different word on his/her sign like Attica,

kuschwitz, Dachau, My Lai, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Kent State, Jackson State, Orange-

purs, cic. The spectres should not talk to anyone but maintain a haunting silence.

•loodbath

lave participants dress in old clathes and set rallons of blood from your local slaughter

jouse of many cans of: diluted tomato soup (easier than katsup) .

As Dinner guests start

io arrive get as close to the entrance to the Dinner as possible and everyone lie down

"Victims of a Nixon Bombing" or 1300 Vietnamese neople butchered today" or "While you

least people die" etc.

llave the sign holders say, "Why did we kill these people?" and

ry to get inside the place of the Dinner and do your theatre inside. You could get

at with a vandalism charge if you spread the blood around so either keep the blood on

To

In 9/71, Capt. CLAUDE CISPANI, BureaU of Criminali

has for several years conducted

one-man demonstrations against

U.S. involvement in Vietnam but that he was considered to be

a "harmless old man" who has never engaged in any overt or

subversive activity against the U.s.

BENT /ANDRESEN

In 11/71, background re ANDRESEN was developed and

it was

determined

that he was born 1/14/08.

No derogatory

information was developed during this investigation, and

ANDRESEN was not known to be involved in any subversive

activities.

JOHN C.XHESS, JR.

HESS was the subject of an investigation by the

Newark Division during the period 5/4-11/2/71. It was learned

that HESS was born in 2/52, and is a student at Newark State

College,

Union, N.J. During this investigation it was learned

that a P.O, Box in Kearny, N.J., was rented by HESS in the

name of the New Jersey Peace Action Center.

The only mail

received in this box was a WRL pamphlet which arrived approx-

imately once a month.

No subversive activities on the part

of HESS were noted during this investigation.

In view of the foregoing, and since all investigative

efforts concerning captioned organization and its membership

in New Jersey,

have been essentially negative, Newark feels

that the possibility exists that the great majority of the

635 members attributed to WRL in New Jersey may be WRL

sympathizers who appear on WRI mailing lists as opposed to

actual members of a viable WRI chapter in New Jersey.

Newark will keep this case in a pending status pending

receipt of more concrete information Irom new York as to

organizational status and membership in New Jersey IRL. In

absence of such concrete information, Newark will close instant

case file, VACB.

University of Oklahoma,

Norman, Oklahoma

The War Resisters League. (WRI) has been

publicly described as founded in 1923

and is the American section of the War

Resisters International, a worldwide.

pacifist movement.

ORIGIN:

A WRL was recently organized at the University of

OkLahoma (OU), Norman, Oklahoma, by one JOEL COHEN, an OU

student who claims to be a pacifist.

COHEN indicated the

WRI at OU had been recognized as a student organization by

the OU Student Congress on February 2, 1971.

COHEN also'

indicated he hoped that the OU WRI could work closely with

the OU Committee to 'End the War, in Vietnam (CEWV).

(OC T-1, 2/10/71)

The OU CEWV is a peaceful student group

whose aims are to protest the Vietnam war,

draft, military, and university policy, but

in the past has stressed that any activity

would be non-violent.

(OC T-I, 2/10/71)

AIMS, PURPOSES, AFFILIATION

According to JOEL COHEN, an 0U student, Norman,

WAR TAX RSSISTANCE (WIR) :

INTERNAL SECURITY - NEW LEFT

PURPOSE:

To advise that national WIR organizing conference to be held

Milwaukee, 1/7-9/72, and to recommend discreet informant coverage

que to past viR activities and current VTh connection wich war

a no on me earo hold

Resisters League (VRL) and Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice

(PCPJ), organizations under active investigation due to subversiva

involvement.

BACKGROUND:

VTR 1s movement in U.s. to resist paying income taxes

which antiwar activists feel contribute to assisting U.S. Government

continue war in Vietnam. Although we have conducted no active

investigation of WIR, we follow WIR activities through established

sources due to past demonstrations throughout U.s. and attempts to

disrupt operations of Internal Revenue Service (IRS). At meeting

of WTR, 7/71, new tactics were adopted to effectively disrupt IRS

and included

resisting the withholding system for paying income

taxes and attempting to recruit IRS employees to help with internal

215121

sabotage of IRS.

Through

our investigations of WRi and PCPJ, it is clear

that the same activists and leaders of PCPJ and WRL are also moving

forces behind WTR.

We note that headquarters of WTR is 339 Lafayette

Street, New Xork City, which is also headquarters address of WAL.

We

further note that among Working Committee of WTR are listed names

•Bradford Lyttle, David McReynolds, David Dellinger, Douglas Dowd

and Ron Young!.

all of whom are principal activists in WiL and PCPJ.

We have been actively investigating PCPJ since its inception

due to considerable information developed that it is thoroughly

infiltrated by members of Communist Party, USA. We initiated active

investigation of VRL, long-time pacifist group, during 10/71, after

cafefully analyzing numerous indications that WRL was engaging in

actions contrary to internal security interest of U.S. For'example,

during 5/71, numerous informants advised that Wri was emerging as

Memorandum

' to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

War Tax Resistance (WTR) .;

100-457215

main funding and guiding organization of PCPJ.

This Information

was corroborated through independent investigation, including fact

that on 8/11/71 check in amount of $2,335, payable

to PCPJ, was drawn

on lal account in New York City.

Other information reported that

WRI staff member, David McReynolds, was circulating proposal encouraging

disruptions of Government installations, including IBI offices, on

10/13/71.

Subsequently, McReynolds traveled to Russia and then to

Hanoi to

meet with North Vietnamese representatives.

Our informants

have reported that Vil activists have considerable knowledge concerning

locations of fugitive deserters who are attempting to elude military

service and are frequently seeking refuge in Canada.

Our New York and Milwaukee Offices have developed informa

tion that WIR will sponsor National Tax Resistance Conference,

Milwaukee, 1/7-9/72. Alleged purpose is to build national tax

resistance movement and form national organization which better

reilects needs and ideas of people across U.S. First notification

oi this conference came from New York Informant who is active in WRI

and indicated that WiL was behind conference.

Milwaukee informant

advised that preparations for conference in Milwaukee area being

handled by WiL representative in that area who has prepared nationwide

mailing regarding conference using WRL letterhead stattonery.

OBSERVATIONS:

Mflwaukee Office has Indicated live informant coverage will

be provided of conference.

Based on past WIR activities, we can be

reasonably certain that further plans will be made at conference

for further demonstrations and possible disruptions of Government

operations, ineluding IRS, during 1972. Since it 1s felt conference

will be heavily influenced and attended by wil activists, offices having

bulk of WRI activity should be canvassed immediately to determine

if large delegations will be attending from those territories.

this be the case, we should consider authorizing attendance of. It

informants from territories having large delegations.

Due to nature

of conference, we will insist on discreet coverage through long-

established informants and only if size of delegation warrants addi

tional informant coverage.

ACTION:

Attached for approval is teletype to key WRI Offices

requesting inmediate canvass of informants regarding conference.

ORATORIUM ON VAR TAXES - 1972

I.S

the war in Indochina winding down?? Pres. Nixon would have us think so.

The

enlated boubing of North Vietnam has clearly demonstrated to us that the merican gov

ernnent (as nany of us alread! knew) has been waging a new type of war - an hIR iR -

dirccted by complex electronic systens.

Protest has increasingly grown over the past ten years to such an extent that the

government rcalized it had to mako a nove to quiet the Anerican people It bogan with-

drawing inerican troops so that fewer Anerican men would die. I now phase of the war

began - Vietnamization: Asians are boing faid and armed by our governnent to fight their

hsian brothers and sisters 160,000 Anericans still remain in Indochina and if we are

to believe our Presi, about 30, 000-60,000 will renain in Indochina for sone tine. In

order to show the "eneny" that we weren't, winding down the war (while telling us differ

ently) our governnent has stepped up the AIR Wir. Every day thousands of bombs fall on •

the people of Indochina. Recently, there was a five-day escalation of the bonbings over

North Viétnar. Pres. Nixon has made it clear that as soon as it looks as though the

"enemy" is getting out of line the bonbings will be escalated.

While the nature of the war in Indochina has been changing, there have also been

new developments within the anti-war novement. Many people are convinced that nore

local actions are needed rather than putting a lot of tine and money trying to organize

a nass rally once every four to six nonths. Many people believe that the anti-var

novenient should be nore decentralized. Many people believe that the anti-war novenent

should relate more to what caused the

war in Indochina; to what causes the Arms Raco;

to what causes the inerican governent to support dictatorships (like the Pakistan gov't.

dictatorship); and also to what causes the problens that exist in this country.

War Tax Resistance began two years with the idea that the anti-war movement must

to beyond protest and nove into non-cooperation and at the same tine start building

sonething new.

Gradually our ranks have grown.

As the novement has grown, so have we.

He renlized that we must do more than suggest that people stop paying war taxes. We

realized that people nust start using their refused taxes for local connunity needs.

So no suggested that war tex refusers join together

and start Alternative Funds.

Wer Tax Resistance now has the organizational franework (over 190 WIR Centers)

to grow into a nass novement.

The AIR WiR and confusion within the anti-war novetont

as to what tactics to take now should cause war tax resistance to spread.

However,

how are we going to build a real nass novenent?? How do we get nassive publicity and

still he decentralized and build a novement??

I think we can build war tex resistance rallies all across the country on ipril 15th.

Focus of these rallies should be on the hIR WiR and resistance - noncooperation with

the doath nachine and nost important - the use of the refused war taxes for life sorving

purposes

Io build these rallies will require a lot of hard work in the next few

nonths.

This work should begin innediately all across the country with: neetings,

litorature tables, strect theatre, interviews, vigils, infornation tables at IRS; press

conferences, etc.

These snall actions should be leading towards bigger actions on

People who are already resisting could conc forward at press conferences

or other public actions and call on their fellow citizens to join then Alternative

Funds could be started. Every organization which is involved in the novement for

social chinge should be strongly encourrged to join this campaign and to participate

*

actively in it. The Catholic Peace Fellowship has already joined WIR in this campaign.

out lubruary and March and into pril, culminating on ipril 15th in actions of

stance all across the country. These actions nust be more than protosts but actions

rcsistance that show a rond towards a new society. This novenent, if it is grass-

roots, will hove the nonuntun (at least it should) to keep on going after ipril 15th.

DI. George lald said that there are now thousands resisting war taxes but if we are

renlly scrious about being effective we must be hundreds and even nillions of people

openly resisting. That noans that all of us rust work hard and convince others to

vcri hard.

Besides the actions I suggested above we could also begin tours of the country.

Wa should have two or nore people traveling by the first of february in every region of

the country. It would bo better if these peoplo lived in the region they were traveling

in but pooplo frou National VIR are willing to 60 anyplace people foel they are needed.

These trevclers should visit every peace center they can and get conitnents fron then

to work on the ill campaign. They should help get iTR Centers started, help existing

wth centers get more support, and help start Alternative lunds. They should have lots

of litcrature with then.

Advertiscuents should be taken out in najor newspapers and nagazines calling for

a noratoriun of war taxes in 1972. These ads could be sponsored by a long list of

organizations and people.

We could also encourage our Sponsors of VIR to write articles

in publications. We should be proloting the new WIR book, AIN'T GONNA PAY FOR WAR NO

HORE". We should have NiW buttons, stickers and posters pronoting APRIL 15 - MORITORIUM

O' WilL PIXES DAY (or whatever ve decide to call it). He should get these out as soon

is possible so people vill be talking about it for some tire.

All of the things I an talling about for pronoting the campaign will costs lots

of roney, National WIR already has a debt of over $6,000. We need to cut this out

complatoly and raise lots of money.

the country and other benefits for WIR. We should raise enough noncy so that we can

hely other WIR Centers strt ernozigns in their town, cities. We need to reise enough

rioncy so that we ern print thousands of leaflets and other promotions such as the

buttons, stickers and

posters I nention above. We need brainstorning how we are going

to raise this noncy.

I hnve vritten this ???? (whatever you vant'to call it) to give sone direction to

the conference this weekend.

I hope that when we leave this weekend we will all be

going back to our connunities

ready to work.

Hopefully, this document. you have just

tion Cooperative which was designed to appeal to high school

students dissatisfied with the quality of the education

offered by the Albuquerque public high schools but that AWRI

was unsuccessful in this effort due to lack of interest on

the part of high school students in the area.'

AQ T-8 made available a leaflet issued by the

Liberation Cooperative which describes it as

"an alternative

to public high school 'education'

... a humanistic education

that stresses creativity, individuality and a real awareness

of where we are in the world instead of conformity and apathy."

Information has been developed by the New York office that

the War Resisters League (WRL) has undertaken a project aimed at crippling

the Selective Service System in 1971. This plan calls for the obtaining of

signatures of 100, 000 men of draft age in a petition of noncooperation with,

the Selective Service System. The plan also calls for a national strike

against the draft starting in January, 1971.

The WRL is a known pacitist organization with headquarters

ạt

nin

339 Lafayette Street, New York City. It is recommended an airtel be

sent to all Special Agents in Charge to insure all offices are alert to the

activities of this organization, and to insure proper investigation is

conducted relating to possible violations of the Selective Service Act. White House

and Selective Service Headquarters were previously advised of WRL plans.

ACTION:

If approved, the attached airtel will be sent to all Special Agents

in Charge to alert them to possible violations of the Selective Service Act

emanating from this group.

(WL), a pacifist oxganizarzor

located at 339 Lafayette Street, New York, New York (NY),

has undertaken a project armed at crippling the Selective

Service Systen in 1971. This project can be broken down

into three phases:

1. NON-COOPERATION WITH THE DRAFT. The WRI

along with other groups is pushing total non-contact with

arait boards (non registration, non-compance szen any

regulacions, no cooperation aù all. The sharlottestille

pledge, a nasional project of the Inion lor Notional Deaft

"Doposition TUNDO)

states

that once 200,000 men 5xgn, 211 w211

non-cooperate with Selective Service.

This pledge is being

circulated all over the country by WRL groups as well as

other anti-drait organizers.

It is estimated that close to

25,000 men have already signed it or mailed back their drait

cards.

2.

COMPLICITY STATEMENT.

The UNDO Chapter at

Union College in Schenectady is circulating a statement for

those who are not draftable. It states chat all those who

sign aid, abet and support draft resistance.

This calls for a national strike against

the diat starting on January 1, 1971, and with people

acting immediately without wasting for 100,000 oshers to

join.

this action is being bacied by the following

organizations (so far)::

Campus Resistance

Radical Student Union

• San Francisco Liberation Front

National Student Association

The VRi, is providing national liaison between the

growing

list of groups backing

this assault on Selective

Service.

It is felt that all those joining in along with

the "fallout" of many others being pulled in by the "air

of rebellion" will produce a substantial anount of resistance

and possibly do so much damage to the drait that it vill

canse to be a viable government agency.

APPEARANCE OF IGAL ROODENKO

AT OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,

NORFOLK, VIRGINIA

FEBRUARY 8, 1971

on february s, 1971, Ne 1-1, who has furnishe

reliable information in the past, advised that an out of

town speaker was scheduled to appear at Old Dominion

University (ODU), Norfolk, Virginia,, on February 8, 1971.

NF T-l advised that this individual

was due to speak on

two occasions in the Kaufman Hall at ODU at 3:30 PM and

at 8:00 PM on February 8, 1971.

NF I-l indicated that

this individual was due to speak on draft evasion.

The February 8, 1971 issue of The Mace and Crown,

the

student publication

at ODU, reported that the National

Chairman of the War Resisters League (WRL) • Igal Roodenko

would hold two programs on February 8, 1971, at did Dominion

University. According to the article, Roodenko's appearance

would mark the beginning of a new drive by local activists

including CADA (Campus Americans For Democratic Action) to

put more pressue on the "Nixon Administration to end the war

in Indo-China."

The article indicates that Roodenko, who had been

on the Executive Committee of the WRL since 1948, was "billed

as discussion leader" for the programs to be held at 3:30 PM

and 8:00 PM in the Kaufman Auditorium. This program, according

to the news

article, was free; however, contributions would be

accepted.

The news article continued in pointing out that

although the prime aim of the programs was to make plans to

Roodenko was prepared

develop a Norfolk chapter of the WRa"Revolutionary Non-Violence,

to discuss related topics including,

RE:

APPEARANCE OF IGAL ROODENKO,

ETC.

According to the news article, Roodenko, during

World War II, served twenty months of a three year sentence

for refusing

to cooperate with the draft and has since

served shorter jail terms imposed for anti-war and civil

rights actions.

Roodenko, according to the article, has been

abroad twice in the interest of peace: In 1950 he attended

the World Pacifists Meeting in India

and in 1966 he spent

six months establishing closer ties with Pacifists and

peace workers in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Scandinavia.

At approximately 4:00 PM, on February 8, 1971,

there was observed an announcement

in the Kaufman

Auditorium to the effect that the 3:30 PM meeting had been

postponed due to the bad weather enccuntered by roodenko

In Washington, D. C.

The announcement continued in stating

that the 8:00

PM

meeting would be held

as scheduled.

NE I-2, who has furnished reliable information

in the past, advised that the appearance of Igal Roodenko

was held as scheduled in the auditorium of the Kaufman

Hall, the Engineering Building, at ODU.

NF T-2 indicated

that twenty-two individuals attended this meeting, one of

whom was an adult and another appeared to be an OdU campus

NF T-2 pointed out further that one of the adults.

was a Negro male, approximately 20-23 years of age, and the

other individuals appeared to be of college age.

indicated further that there were about five extreme hippie"

types among those in the audience. NF T-? reported also on ?/9

from 8:00 - 9:55 PM, when the group dispersed because the

auditorium had to be relinquished at 10:00 PM.

Roodenko

reportedly called for resistance to the war in Vietnam

and through veiled innuendos prompted those in attendance

to resist the draft and the war in any method they felt

was right.

Both Bunch and Roodenko called for a concerted

effort by individuals in the Norfolk area to support the

May? 1971 demonstration at Washington, D.C. It came

"hippie" type individuals, came from New York and possibly

stopped at both Washington, D. C., and Richmond, Virginia,

before coming to Norfolk.

It was also learned according

to NE I? from discussions in the meeting that Roodenko

supposedly was going from Virginia to Georgia, where he

would appear at some undisclosed colleges in that state.

NF T-2 advised that Roodenko

reportedly was

appearing at different colleges and universities throughout

the country in an effort to build anti-Vietnam War support

and

also build support for the May, 1971, demonstration in

Washington, D. C.

NF I-2 also indicated that Ron Bunch had pointed

out that during the month of March, efforts would be made

to begin publishing some type of WRL newspaper and make

every effort to organize a Norfolk Chapter of the WRL.

Bunch also stated that he would arrange to have anti-war

films shown at ODU in the coming weeks.

During the discussions

which followed the speeches by Bunch and Roodenko, those present

were asked to indicate by signing their names to a list, their

interest in participating or joining a chapter of the WRI

should such a chapter be formed in the future. NE T-2 indicated

that possibly five to

seven individuals placed their names

on the list. Also, literature was passed out during the

meeting which consisted of the following:

February 8, 1971, issue of The Mace and Crown,

Student Publication.

A booklet "American Servicemen Have Rights--Do

You Know Yours?"

War Resisters League, founded in 1923.....

• VIETNAM?

MAKE IT YOURSELF

CONFIDENTIAL

You probably have a son, brother, husband or friend in the military. May-

be in Vietnam. And like most Americans, you want it over. And you hate

it for what it is doing to our own country and to Vietnam.

After all the publicity about "troop withdrawals" we still have 400,000

men there. About 100 are still coming home each week in cold aluminum

boxes. No one ever voted for this war. Congress never declared it. Yet it

seems impossible to end it. The generals get promotions, the corporations

get profits, and the young men get killed

But... maybe we can end the war. After all, we pay for the war, we make

the weapons, we serve in the army. Agnew talks a good war, but he isn't

doing the fighting. Suppose we-one by one, as individuals-started getting

out of the war. You could stop paying your 10% federal telephone tax.

Businessmen and professors could stop cooperating with the government.

Trade unions could demand peace contracts instead of war contracts.

Soldiers, sailors, marines could walk off their bases and find welcome in

our homes.

In March there were, all across America, hundreds of citizens arrested for

blocking doors at draft boards and induction centers. In Texas, California,

Pennsylvania, New York, and elsewhere, draft boards were forced to close

down temporarily. Without violence, without weapons, we learned that

we had the power to stop the war machine. Without violence, without

weapons, we were able to keep the issues clear: we were acting against the

war and against the draft-and not against the police and the draft board

clerks. The enemy is not men and women, but the military-industrial

machine that kills our sons and brothers, and wastes our tax dollars on

death.

Friend-could any war be fought if privates put their guns down and let

generals do the fighting? Could any war be fought if civilians stopped mak-

ing the guns and the bullets? Let us declare peace. They have jailed some

of us for refusing to go into the army. They can jail more of us. But they

cannot jail all of us. If we refuse to fight, the war will be over, suddenly,

everywhere, and at once.

We are against the war in Vietnam. We are against all war- against

the war of man against man everywhere, and of man against nature.

We are against systems that hurt people, as the American system

hurts people in our ghettos and in Latin America and Asia, and as

the Russian system hurts its own people by jailing poets and by in-

vading Czechoslovakia. It is good for us to try to love one another,

but it is not good enough. We must also change the systems that tax -

us, put us in uniform and send us off to kill one another.

We are out on the streets today to ask that all of us look at each other

without labels. We are against putting labels on people-like "capi-

talist," "commie," "hippie," "pig." Before anything else, men and

women are alive, separate, individual. All of us can be hurt, can die,

get angry, want to be loved, and all of us on this planet, this life raft

we call Earth, will make it together or we won't make it at all.

mê is running out for all of us on Earth and we have nowhere else

to go. No nation has the right to build atom bombs, or use napalm,

or pollute the air we all breathe, or the water we all drink

We will keep on saying, all across America, that the war in Vietnam is

our number one problem, and it must be ended now by total, imme-

i diate American withdrawal from Vietnam. But once that war is over

your real job will begin: the job of disarming all nations, and of nurs-

ing our cities, our forests, our rivers, our air, our peoples and our

children back to health.

Give earth a chance. There will be no second chance.

Napalm, terrorism, riots, war. From Saigon to Biafra to Tel Aviv

to Cairo to the streets of our own cities both the Right' and the

'Left' talk of violence as if it were a necessary and even healthy

tool for man's progress. Above this display of threat and counter-

threat is the nuclear bomb. Washington and Moscow flourish their

bombs and rockets while millions starve. We live in a world where

society runs on we basis of implied or open terror.

It there are times when you have found yourselt in a minority of

one because you question whether violence can ever lead us to a

human community, you should know you are not alone. The War

Resisters League, with about ten thousand members, is an associ-

ation of people who disagree on mauy subjects,

but who all

The War Resisters League is important because, by

union, it relieves our courageous and resolute individ-

uals of the paralyzing feeling of isolation and loneli-

ness, and in this way gives them moral support in the

•fulfillment of what they consider their duty. The exist-

ence of such a moral elite is indispensable for the

preparatice of a fundamental change in public opin-

ion, a chasge that, under present day circumstances,

is absolute.y necessary if humanity is to survive.

ALBERT EINSTEIN

agree about ond thing: we all refuse to support or participate in

• any kind of war, international or civil, and we strive to remove

. the causes of mar.

Founded in 1923 the League is the American section of the War

Resisters International, a world-wide pacifist movement with

headquarters in London, sections in 23 nations on all five contin-

ents, and contec in 41 other countries including left and right

CONFIDENTIAL

totalitarian cousies. The carly efforts of the League emphasized

the importance e. individual resistance to war. It sought to dis-

courage men from enlisting in the military and when, in 1940, a

peacetime draft is instituted it worked for liberal provisions for

conscientious chectors and it supported imprisoned pacifists.

Over the years hundreds of League members have done alterna-

tive service. Hurdreds of others have been jailed, in some cases

because their cla...to C.o, status was not recognized and in other

cases because thi, rutused any cooperation with conscription.

The major threst of the League in recent years has been in the

direction of socisi and political activities. It became clear, with

the developmer; if nuclear weapons, that world war could be

waged without zass armies. Everyone is concerned with finding

ways of structuring society so that it will not need arms, and with

resolving conflics between nations which lead to war. League

IN 55296 DocId:32989688

Page 146

members believe that war is more than the sudden explosion of

hostilities. The covert violence of economic exploitation, political

repression, cultural decay, colonialism and racism produce ten-

sions leading to armed struggle. Even where there seems to be

peace the 'quiet deaths' from starvation and sickness that strike

down peasants in Brazil, sharecroppers in Mississippi and babies

in Harlem are as real and terrible as the deaths from bullets and

The League therefore relates the struggle against war to the

struggle for a free and just society, for a world where poverty and

disease are eliminated and freedom becomes a living reality for all

men and women everywhere. Because war is also rooted in human

apathy, in that alienation of men from society which leaves the

individual feeling helpless, the League stresses the importance of

the individual decision and personal responsibility in acting for

peace and social justice, It it opposes the totalitarian mind at

home and abroad, the League does so because it belteves human

beings are never means to an end. They are ends in themselves.

THE WRI MEMBER

Members vary greatly in their approach to the problems of war

and peace. Some express their committment by registering as con-

scientious objectors. Others engage in programs of nonviolent

direct action and organizing. Some believe the pacifist position

stands 'outside history' and that little can be done aside from try-

ing, in personal ways, to break down patterns of violence in their

own lives and their immediate community. Others believe pacifists

must engage themselves in political action and offer radical alter-

natives on a political level. Some refuse to pay all or part of their

taxes. Some burn their drait cards or openly refuse to register for

the draft, risking their comfort and freedom.

Most League members do not refuse to pay their taxes and do

register for the draft, going through the legal process of getting

CO status and doing alternative service. There are League mem-

bers who have never been in a demonstration in their lives. There

are clean shaven members with jackets and ties-and others with

beards, long hair and sandals. But all, consistent with their con-

victions, try to express these convictions as dramatically and con-

vincing y as possible within their. own lives and in the communities

around them.

WHAT IS A PACIFIST?

This is a tricky question and one you have to answer for yourself.

If you are now in the military of any nation and aren't trying to

get out of the uniform, then clearly you aren't a pacifist. But the

League has many members who were, at one time, in the miltary.

The League has members ho did not consider themselves paci-

fists until after the nuclear bomb which, they felt, made violence a

rarely, if ever, can there be an ethical justification for killing an-

other human being. The religious pacihst, who may belong to an

established religion or who may be acting out of his own personal

faith, regards the destruction of human life for whatever reason

as a violation of absolute principles. The political pacifist, intent

on cónstructing a rational social order, conceives war to be the

ultimate manifestation of the irrational. All three of these views,

variations and combinations of them, are represented in the men-

bership of the League. But even in the area of pacifsm there are

legitimate differences. The absolute pacifist says no to violence

at all levels of his life, personal and public. But others who would

face prison rather than serve the military may feel violence is per-

• missible to defend themselves or their families against attack by

* another individual. Some pacifsts oppose, and others accept, the

use of minimal violence by a police force within the context of law.

MEMBERSHIP

Membership in the League means what you want it to mean.

There are no instructions going out from a "central committee."

The League is made up of individuals who are prepared for per-

sonal responsibility in their own communities. What makes the

League a unique organization, and one that is sometimes difficult

to understand, is that it exists to provide help to its members as

they carry their own beliefs into action and to provide a possible

framework for that action. There is no "League Discipline."

At times League members find themselves in a lonely position,

particularly during wars when so many of our younger members

are imprisoned. But in the lonely hour when a League member

realizes he cannot submit to conscription or that he cannot in con-

science sign a loyalty oath, there is the knowledge that others

throughout the country and the world stand with him. Not great

masses— the League's membership is small-but the individual

knows that through him, at the point of his decision, the League

is in action. The member knows that he belongs to an intangible

but very real "community of concern" and is bound to others in a

fellowship of action.

SUPPORT FOR THE LEAGUE

The League is supported entirely by contributions irom its mem-

bers and friends.

There are very few large contributions and a

great many contributions of one, and ten, and twenty dollars a

year. There are no dues. Members give what they feel able to give.

If they feel themselves to be members, they remain members even

if they cannot give anything.

WHAT THE LEAGUE DOES

Pacifist action— not passivity-charactcrizes the work of the Lea-

gue. Employing tactics which Gandhi pioneered in the struggle

for Indian independence or devising new nonviolent tactics to

nect new situations, the pacifist secks to resolve conflict without

violence. He acts to end the covert as well as the overt violence.

The League is more concerned with getting the job done than with

• getting credit. It may surprise you to find that groups and projects

in Which you have been involved were initiated by or had a close

relationship with the League. It's not without

national alices are known as "the peace factory." Cause that our

These projects and activities include civil rights work, where a

League staff member was assigned as early as 1955 to work closely

with Martin Luther King. Jr. and where staff time was put into the

March on Washington in 1963 and the Poor Peoples Campaign

of 1968. The government's nonsense about Civil Defense was

brought to a grinding halt starting with mass demonstrations in

New York City in 1960 and 1961 organized by the League. Many

were jailed, but compulsory Civil Defense drills are no longer

held. The first anti-Vietnam war demonstrations in the United

States were organized by the League and subsequent demonstra-

tions have been led in part by WiL people. Liberation magazine

was originally financed by the League and WIN Magazine is co-

published by the League.

League work has reached overseas, as staff members helped di-

rectly to rally world support for the nonviolent revolutionary

movement in Africa. In 1953 the League raised funds to send Bill

Stitherland to Africa to help explore nonviolent methods there,

and some years later other members went to the Sahara Desert to

demonstrate against French A-bomb tests. The WRL role was

publicly noted by Kenneth Kaunda, Prime Minister of Zambia,

"Please express to your membership my deep respect

for the aims and objectives of the League," In 1968 the WRL

sent two members to participate in protests organized by our

International in Warsaw Pact Capitals against the invasion of

Czechoslovakia.

In the area of public education it was League members who

played the major role in setting up radio station KPFA-FM in

Berkeley, California (a "listener-sponsored noncommercial" sta-

tion) which has since grown into the "Pacifica Foundation" with

In recent years League members have begun setting up a number

of local Centers, linked to the WRI but as independent as our

membership. Such groups operate across the country and provide

a means for grass roots work and action by members. For in-

stance, our Atlanta group does important work in bringing the

idea and practice for pacinism to the South and particularly to the

many Southern military areas. Our San Francisco office is in the

forefront of West Coast action working in Draft nonregistration

and with persecuted anti-war G.I.'S.

the rallying cry of the nonviolent movement was frst heard in

the dark at the October 21 Pentagon demonstration in 1967, "Join

s!" It grew out of the community the demonstrators felt as they

sat, surrounued by police and soldiers, and conironted the symbol

of imperial America. They shouted "join us" to the soldicrs and

police because there are no barriers to men in our movement.

G.I.'s and police are not called "pigs" in our movement because

G.l.'s and police are people and not pigs; they are our brothers

and sisters. As you are. We hope you will join the Movement at

some level. If you are not certain that you are a pacilst there are.

other Movement groups (write WRL for information). There are

League projects which you might want to help with your time or

money. Perhaps you are not certain how you feel about the ques-

tion of pacifism but would like to keep in touch with the League-

we welcome you to our mailing list.

But quite possibly you belong in the League as a member. Like

many Americans you may never have thought of yourself as a

pacifist, but you may have been re-examining your position in the

light of nuclear weapons and the war on Vietnam. The League

welcomes all those who want to explore nonviolent alternatives

and who realize that such exploration means creating a movement

independent of any power bloc and opposed to the militarism of

any nation, East or West, right or left. The League's work. will

not end with peace in Vietnam; it will continue until all war and

its causes, everywhere, is abolished.

The War Resisters League wants your membcrship. If you want

to support and work with the League, we invite you to join.

CAMPUS AMERICANS FOR DEMOCRATIC ACTION

NORFOLK, VIRGINIA

HN 55296

The September 25, 1958, issue of "The Mace and Crown,"

the campus publication of Old Dominion University (ODU), Norfolk,

virginia, reported that the ODU Chapter of the Students for a

Democratic Society (SDS, voted on September 20, 1968, to

disband its organization

under the name, and reform and affiliate

with the Campus Americans for Democratic Action (CADA). Accord-

ing to the axticle, this information came from ODU student

"Bill" Deane (William Boyd Deane, Jr.d, the former chairmar

of the SDS Chapter at ODU.

The article pointed out that Deane said the primary

reason for disbanding was because the SDS Chapter at ODU did

not agree with the national policy of violent overthrow of

the Government held by SDS.

Deane also reportedly said that

most of the members of the new organization still were against

The war in Vietnam and the present draft system, which are identical

to some of the other SDS aims.

According to the article, Deane gave the national and

international CADA attitudes and goals as:

I. Expanded war on poverty

2.

Lowering the voting age to eighteen

3.

Guaranteed annual income

4.

Liberalized abortion policies

5. Non-proliferation of nuclear arms

More economic and less military aid to

foreign countries

Strengthening of the United Nations.

The DDU Chapter has publicly announced it is affiliated

with the national organization of CADA.

On May 22, 1970, a source advised that CADA continues to

be active on the ODU campus.

It has spearheaded campus anti-

war activity involving protest demonstrations.

He also advise

that CADA objectives continue to be substantially the same as

those above.

The SDS is characterized separately in

the appendix.

APPENDIX

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

national leadership has revealed a growing Marxist-Leninist ad-

herence which currently calls for the building of a revolutionary

youth movement. Currently, the program of SDS has evolved from

civil rights struggles to an anti-Vietnam war stance to an advo-

cacy of a militant anti-imperialist position.

China, Vietnam

Cuba are regarded as the leaders of the worldwide struggles

against United States imperialism whereas the Soviet Union is

held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expelled.

a result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its National

Headquarters at 1608 West Madison reet, Chicago, and the PL

raction set up headquartens in Car .idge, Massachusetts.

headquarters subsequently moved to loston. Each group elected

its own national officers, which:

clude three national secretaries

I a National Interim Committee of eight.

Both the NO forces

and the PLP forces claim to be the true SDS. Both groups also

print their versions of "New Left Votes" which sets forth the

line and the program of the particilar faction.

The NO version

of "New Left Notes" was recently Irinted under the title "The

Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within the

No group, namely, the Weatherman. r Revolutionary Youth Movement

RIM. - factIon, and the RIM Il I ctIon.

Weatherman is action-

oriented upholding Castro's posit on that the duty of revolution-

aries is tò make revolution. Wea herman is regarded by RYM II

an adventuristic, elitist fact on which denies the historical

role of the working

class as the ase for revolution.

RYM II

maintains that revolution, although desired, is not possible

under present conditions, hence phasizes organizing and raising

political consciousness of te working class upon whom they

successful revolution depen.s

Although disclaiming con-

trol and domination by the Commu: ist Party, USA, leaders in

these two factions have in the p.st proclaimed themselves to be

communists and to follow the pre epts of a Marxist-Leninist

philosophy, along pro-Chinese co munist lines.

Because of this autonomy internal

struggles reflecting the major factional interests of the SDS have

occurred at the chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70

school year.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY (PLP)

1965, page 21, reported that a new party of

ism" was formally founded on April 18, 1965, under the name of the

PiP, which had been known as the Progressive Labor Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor Move-

ment was founded in 1962 by Milton

ounded an

Rosen and Mortimer Scheer after

they were expelled from the Communist Party

of the United States

for assertedly following the Chinese Communist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP held its

second National Convention in New York City May 31 to June 2, 1968,

at which time the Plp reasserted its objective of the establish-

ment of a militant working class movement based on Marxism-Leninism.

This is to be accomplished through the Party's over-all revolu-

tionary strategy of raising the consciousness of the people and

nelping to provide ideological leadership in the working class

struggle for state power.

The source also advised that at the Second National Con-

vention Milton Rosen was unanimously re-elected National Chairman

Jared Israel, Willian

as che

National Committee to lead the PLP until the next convention.

The PLP publishes "progressive Labor", a bimonthly

magazine; "World Revolution", a quarterly periodical; and

"Chailenge-Desario", a monthly newspaper.

The April, 1969, issue of "Challenge-Desafio" sets forth

that "Challenge is dedicated to the people's fight for a new way of

life--where the working men and wonen control their own homes and

factories; where they themselves make up the entire government on

NEW YORK CITY

Captioned individual telephoned the Bureau late yesterday

and spoke to SA Carl J. Hall of the Crime Research Section. Gottlieb said he

was calling locally since, although he lived in New York, he had been in

Washington for the past few days in connection with the anti-war demonstrations.

• Gottlieb said he was connected with the War Resisters League (WRL), which

: Is the American atfiliate of the War Resisters International (WRl), and that

this organization had recently been in the news as a result of the publication

of some of the papers stolen from the FBI at Media, Pennsylvania. Since

• he felt he might be mentioned in FBI files and that he might be injured thereby

at some future time, he said he had written a letter to the Director recently

requesting permission to come to the Bureau and examine our files on the WRI.

He said he had not had a reply to his letter and he was wondering if, in fact,

it had been received by the Dircetor:

Gottlieb was advised of the confidential nature of FBI files and

the fact that even if we had information concerning him or his organization,

It would not be possible to make this data available to him. Gottlieb said he

appreciated being apprised of our policy in these matters but still wondered

if it might be possible to ascertain what happened to his letter. He was told

we would look into this and he said he would call back concerning it. ,

A check of our files reflected that memorandum mate giPp

• from Mr. Gray to Mr. Brennan, captioned "Edward P. Gottlieb, WarJun 17 1971

Resisters International(WRI), Information Concerning' reflects that such an

inquiry was received from Gottlieb and that a reply over Miss Gandy's

5x304449

signature was sent to him on 5-3-71, advising him of the confidential nature

of FBI files.

HIH

Bufiles indicate that Ifthough we have not investigated Gottlieb,"

he is mentioned in several instances in connection with the activities.of. the WRL-.

Women want to be taken

seriously; they want their ideas to be implemented, their

judgment to be respected, their equality with men to be accepted. Though the

establishment has been slow to react to women's legitimate grievances, the peace

movement should be ready with a variety of programs geared to women's specific

resources to help them in their struggle for indenendence and at the same time

to create outlets for a potential constituency of over fifty per cent of the

population. By encouraging women to particinate fully in the peace movement VIRL

will be expressing its solidarity with their liberation movement and will be

adding new dinensions to the pacifist novement by introducing nev organizers and

organizing techniques to it.

The current wonen's movement has created feelings of solidarity among woren that

will ease the process of organizing them for peace action.

It is only fitting

• that women organize themselves,

and the natural bonds that have been fostered a-

mong woren provide a base of initial trust that will albw the first step in the

organizing process - that of establishing a sense of community - to be bypassed.

Once woren acquire confidench in their ability lä state of mind not all that easy

to rcach inlight of the demoralizing education vomen receive) they will be ex-

cellent organizers.

And at first they will probably approach organizing in a

low-key way, a way that will encourage other women to express themselves rather

than to just capitulate to a leader.. by tapping. a new source for skills, the

,movenent will be getting raw talent ther has all the capabilities of cultivated

aptitudes without alot of the hang-ups that develop.

There are of

course several all-wonor peace groups operating now. Generally they

are doing worthwhile. things, and elevating the consciousnesses of many women

who would otherwise not be involved in antivar activities at all. But as pacifists

we can offer more concrete programs of action to women; our clearcut positions on

nonviolence, direct action, and civil discuediénce provide a concrete base from

which to organize and to seek commitmint. Because we are striving for an end to

all war, an end to racism, and economic justice, we have nermanent roots that an

end to the Vietnam Mar will not destroy.

And because our program is so widely

based, we ask for a greater commitrent and more diverse outlets than do existing

women's peace groups.

For many women the programs that WiRL fosters will provide

just the impetus they need to swing into action; our job is to reach these women,

to work with them on the level they!re at, and to encourage increasing comnitment

as their experience and attitudes warrant it.

GOALS

To a great extent the success of the peace movement depends on our ability to create

a unified body of people who work together and who trust each other. By encouraging

women to organize,

but when the government conscripts the young men in the family no one even whimpers.

accurate..i

While the draft does cause men the most "inconvenience" women are effected by it-

also for reasons too well known to belabor here.

It's true that women can'e directy

confront the draft by refusing to serve as men can, they still can protest it in

various ways.

As described above, women can visit draft boards and try tó convince the employees

to refuse to process records;

That's a fine tactic with which to establish a com-

aradie with the clerks, but it doesn't adequately demonstrate the level of militance

to which women are ready to rise in ordor to end conscription.: Noenly picketing

While the government lias never been known to treat women particularly well, police-

Protesting liaz Taxes - Pesisting immoral taxation is open to all peonle. And as our

Therefore, women should be the first to protest war taxes.

Sixty-seven cents af cvary income tax dollar is used for military purposes, and

there are saderal excise taxes on airplane tickets, automobiles, and of course

telephons charges.

Is with resisting the draft, talking to federal employees is

a good consciousness-raising technique, but more direct action is needed to force

For a boycotting operation to be effective there must be a massive publicity drive

operations.

By carrying out, a project independently they will acquire practically

every skill required for movement work

Mr. FRANK BROOKHOUSER is a by-line columnist for "The

editors of the

anti-war magazine "Win" say that a major publisher

is definitely interested in bringing out the files stolen from

the FBI Office in Media. He goes on to say that the editors

(of "Win") seem to be in the know and "have offered..to act as

go-between for the publisher and the thieves."

Mr F BROOKHOUSER's

article is headlined, "Publisher, Thieves Negotiate 'FBI Papers*

as a Book. "

Philadelphia indices contain no information indicating

that Mr. BROOKHOUSER is other than friendly to the FBI and his

use of the word "thieves", accurately describing the MEDBURG

perpetrators, would appear to be a good omen.

I telephoned Mr. SAMUEL BOYLE, City Editor of "The

Mr. BOYLE is an SAC contaçt.

WRI activities during the past several months present

increasing indications that WrI engaged in actions contrary

to the internal security interests of the US.

For example,

whu during May, 1971, was emerging as one of

the prime

organizations funding and guiding activities of the Peoples

Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ), heavily infiltrated

on November 1, 1971, a confidential source who has

I urnished rellable Information in the past advised that the

United States Army Field Band and Chorus, which is currently on

a nation-wide tour, would give a concert at the Albuquerque Civic

Auditorium, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on the evening of November 2,

1971.

This source also

advised that the Albuquerque Chapter of

the WRI would attempt to disrupt the concert..

On November 2, 1971, a second confidential source who

has furnished reliable information in the past advised that the

Albuquerque Chapter of the WRL would conduct a guerrilla theater

outside the Civic Auditorium on the evening of that date during

which the participants would be dressed as clowns and would play

musical instruments.

This source advised that the individuals

who intended to participate in the demonstration intended it to be

peaceful

and they had no plans to enter the Civic Auditorium in

an effort to disrupt the concert by the United States Army Field

Band and Chorus.

A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

observed six males and three females arriving outside the

Albuquerque Civic Auditorium at approximately 7:05 p.m. on the

evening of November 2, 1971, all of these individuals having

their faces painted to resemble clowns, The six males played

harmonicas and kazoos while the females passed out the attached

leaflet.

These

individuals also carried signs reading "Another

Clown For Peace" and "May Peace Be With You."

Dear Friends,

For the past two years anti-war activities have become more widespread

in the Southwest. Local HIRL's have grown rapidly.

¿onviolence has been

at the root of these developments.

ilost of our understanding of

nonviolence came not so nuch from training sessions or speakers but

has developed out of our own needs and concerns. .Now nonviolence has

become the prime mover of change in the Southwest and there is a strong

desire fos better conmunications, a betier sharing of emeriences.

The Southwest is unique because it has no "leaders" or "movement

heavies" hut a lot of good people with experience in lots of different

areas.

Thanksgiving weekend we will come together to share our selves and our

community.

Peonle from Institute/ilt. Hest, GI's for Peace (El Paso.),

Direct Action/WRI, Austin, AFSC San Antonio and Pasadena, Peacemakers,

WL-llest & Souchwest, farrvorker support committees, gay liberation,

and many more will come to share ideas ahout continuing to build the

nonvioleni movement in the Southwest.

Please come and join with us

in a weekend for creative change, "rite oi call for information.

He did not know the itinerary for the

Bus.

It is noted that this telephone call was made to

REICHLE by SA JOHN V. DENEALE without pretent as such or
