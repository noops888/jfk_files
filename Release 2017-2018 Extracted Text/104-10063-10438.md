MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Contact Report of Meetings with MPTROIKA-Z in

New York City on 14 February and in Virginia on

17-18 February 1972

This memorandum covers recent meetings with

MPTROIKA-Y in New York City and in the Northern Virginia

area. The meetings were held under secure conditions and

there were no security incidents noted.

2. Operational:

LUSCEA Study Grited States persistent endoris desocation

_M97's persistent efforts to locate

join a pro-Mao study group finally paid off. The manager

of the China Bookstore finally broke down under MaT's

campaign and put her in touch with a local USCFA study

group under the leadership of Nis susan tarren aka Frank.

MY has attended one session and, based on her initial

observation, provided the assessment of Mrs. Warren attached

hereto at the undersigned's request. M-T believes she has

hit it off with Mrs. Warren because of her understanding

of dialectics (thanks to Andy Ness's tutoring) and, consequently,

she was instructed to attempt to develop a social-business

relationship with her.

With respect to the other members

of the study group, M-T claims that the situation, to date,

has not been conducive to ferreting out the identities of

Cove that she hop

these individuals, but that she hopes that as the group.

b. New School and language instruction: (M-7

has formally enrolled at the Graduate Faculty of the New

School for Social Research in a course entitled "Comparative

Legal Systems," which studies the theories, institutions,

concepts, customs and which purports to analyze and compare

the law and the administration of law in selected countries,

included China, Japan, Vietnam, Germany, the U.S. and the

Soviet Union.

M37 will also enroll in a French language

instruction

course in the near future.

Ramparts' Tours - New York Media Workshop's

Womens' Tour: Acting on a suggestion proposed by Mr. Jason

Horn, CI/SO,

the undersigned raised the subject of the Women's

Your which is scheduled to visit London, Paris (where they

will meet the DRV peace delegation) and Rome from 27 May

25 June 1972 with M-y and instructed her to attempt to determine.

the interest in, and likely composition of, the New York

group and explore the possibility of joining such a group

and explore the possibility of joining such a group. MU?'s

first reaction to the tour was that the cost ($699, which

price includes airfare, trains, hotels, etc.) was too high.

It was explained to her that the cost factor should not

deter her from following through. It was then that (M-7

voices some concern that the timing of the tour may interfere

with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms of

mid-May or June 1972 up to this point).

It was made clear

to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for

her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well

prove to be. of operational interest, e.g meeting the DRV

delegation and continuing the staging process prior to her

actual departure. Mo? said that she understood and would

look into the matter. She did not believe she would have

any difficulty in covering for funds should she find herself

included on the tour.

17 February 1972

SUBJECT:

Mrs. Susan Warren aka Susan Frank

Susan is a tough cookie.

One of her most outstanding

features is a complete lack of interest - in anyone but her-

self.

When leading a China study class this is her method:

first she asks a question, from her notes, such as "what

do you think Mao meant when he said this..."

Then she

clamly listens to what the class thinks Mao menat.

When

everyone finishes Susan begins to tell exactly what he

meant to say.

Through the evening her attitude remains

the same "I've been here before and said this before."

There is no enthusiasm in her that I coutd see.

me.

Susan is an expert on China.

I know because she told

She told everyone else too within the first eight

minutes of class.

"Well, I spoke to those soldiers in

Yunan who fired on those peasants..." But she really didn't

have to advertize her knowledge because it is very apparent.

She has a solid understanding of Chinese political line and

can smoothly defend Chinese history:

As far as the woman herself is concerned she has

not as much money as she would like.

I believe she wants

to dress in

'style.' Now, although dressing conservatively

she still developes an eye for color and she would clearly

be receptive to intelligent male attention. She has a

nice figure and is aware of it.

Perhaps the clue which best typifies Susan's personality

•Is her voice. : It is deep; Slow, even and artificially

cultured.

For example,

"y"s" become "d" in "veddy" or

"Amedica"

• Her hand movements when she speaks are measured and

deliberate.

While listening she fidgits a little but not

much.

two noticible leatures are her thumbnails.

Both are

Eiled almost to points, are very thick and yellowish-

moreso than other nails.

While she is concerned with herself I believe she

would follow someone who either interested her or gently

led her.

There is a part of her normally conservative

character that would like to break away and try new things

(altho' not new ideas in politics.)

One last remark, she is a straightforward person;

will look you in the eye, will tell someone not to speak

too long if she wants to move on to something else.

These observations were made after one meeting in

a study class and for a few minutes

before class.
