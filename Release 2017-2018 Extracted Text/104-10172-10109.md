has been mounted through LIKIYiK-2.

In mid September LIKAMK-2 reported that he had succeeded in getting this

matter to the attention of the President of Mexico through one

of the President'g

Through this channel the President

was generally informed on lialperin's Comunist affiliations and his correction with

Pecormendations were also made

that Sterr's money (which he

had left in l'exico) be frözen 1f possible and that llalperin be decortei.

In the three months following these developments, repeated requests for

news on the matter were made to LIKirik-?, who stuted each time that he had done all

he could when he brought the matter to the President's attention and that he could

not force the point further.

He dia, however, mention it fron tize to tire to both.

the country.

He statei he had heard this from Jose T. SANTILLAi, Director of

Inspections at the Imigration section of the Ministry of Interior.

He then gave

the following explaration for the delays so far encountered in the case:

8 .

So lar as the Mexican Government Mors, HALPERIN has not, while

In Nexico, done anything harmnul to Mexico.

1t 19, thereiore, alnost

inpossible to açoly Article 33 or the Constitution against hir. Article

33, which gives tre President yores to depori any undesirable foreigner,

Is, in effect, applied very iraquently.

One of the reasors is that

the case must be very clear that to foreigner has operates against

l'exican interests. Another is that the case must be very streas since

the intended victin ray appeal to the counts. d third reaso, particularly

applicable in tais case, is that to Government does not sisa to take

strong action in, this case, wich it regaras as political rativer than

criminal.

The verment is respecting the Mexican principle of granting

political asylung

and at the sace time does not wish to put hirself into

a position whers it can become the target of attacks fron'lerist elements in

the country.

Toe government is rurther in a bad position in tis case

because Halverin worked for a Goienment department (Naciral Financiera)

and the Governmert or

various intiviiuals in it do not wish to be placed. in the

position of haring to admit they tale a bad selection.

In the case of francesca Scalia, Jewel swindler and

Immoral character, the Nexican Goverment tried to deport her

for may nonths but was successful only after soveral injunctions

c.

On the other hand, LIKAYAK-2 states that the Govornment has a

recöurse which is not as blunt as Article 33 but is usually sufficient to

result in a person's leaving Nexico. This consists of communicating to

the subject the Mexican Coverment's dissatisfactinn with having him in

the country and inviting him to leave it In a certain period.

The period

can vary from a couple of weeks to several months.

This, incidentally,

was the means used to obtain the departure of the Nicaraguan Communist

Mario SOSA Navarro early in 1957, In a test operation mounted by the

station through LIXAYAK-2.

LIKAYiK-2 states he is thoroughly convinced that his Government

Intends to "invite" Halperin to leave the country.

he points out,

however, that malperin could probably got one or more injunctions

against

LIKIYAK2 appeared to take the matter very personally but pointed out that

In Mexico tie legal forms are observed and the the US. Government, which also

in scrupulous in. its observance of such forms, should be able to
