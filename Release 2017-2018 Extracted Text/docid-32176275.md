affairs to hear talks by MARK LANE and KARU YASUI, called

this number on March 20, 1964, and asked for information about

the Detroit Guardian Committee, stating she was interested as

she had enjoyed talks by LANE and YASUI.

HAESSLER told her there was no active committee, but that a

few people (unnamed) made arrangements for speakers. ¿He said

for

her to read the

"National Guardian" for coming events.(S1

WE Due to Information appearing In this report from

originat committee, and also from

the results of the above

telephone call, 1t

and that is the extent of the activity.
