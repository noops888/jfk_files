NO HERE DO LULLE, DIRECTOR, CIA,

ACCOMPANIED BY SCOTT S. BRECKINRIDGE, JR., DEPUTY

INSECTOR GENERAL, ENTO KNOCHE, ASSISTANT TO THE

DIRECTOR, AND GEORGE L. CARY, LEGISTATIVE COUNSEL

Mr. Colby. I have an answer to a few of the questions

that were raised at the meeting the other day and there are a

couple of clarifications I would like to make.

One, with' respect to the security investigations in the

United States. The question was asked whether we ever used

private investigators, and I said we normally used our own

investigators. We have some relationships with private

investigatory firms which provide cover for our investigators

and, secondly, we have a few firms which we own which are

proprietary if you will, whereby our investigators appear to

be

private.

I said that in the past it is. clear that on occasion we

did ask for private investigator firms to help us to some

degree.

It was usually the one that was giving us cover, and

for reasons of ovorload we asked them to have their own people

to do a few of the investigations.

My General Counsel

says that this is illegal. I have a

strong question about its propriety, if not legality, and I

am undertakirg to rcvicw this matter to see whether we can not

just eliminata that practice ertisely, continting the proprie-

tary and continuing the ase of private investigators as covrs

Chairman Church. Mr. Colby, would you in connection with

your review of this matter supply the Committee with the spe-

cifics in those cases where the Agency has in fact engaged

private investigators to do Agency work?

Mr. Colby. I will certainly try to, Mr. Chairman.

confess this may be a tough job to locate every case but I

certainly will do my best.

• Chairman Church. Will you provide the committee with the

opinion of your Counsel with respect to the legality of such?

Mr. Colby. I will.

Chairman Church.

such use of private investigators?

Mr. Colby. Yes.

Chairman Church. And then I would ask the staff also

furnish the conmittee with a brief on that question so that we

are-fully advised with respect to the law.

MI. Colby. Right.

The second subject, Mr. Chairman.

Senator Mondale asked

for our command and control regulations for the approval of

covert action projects. These vere supplied to the staff on

the first of May and are available to the staff.

Thirdly, I was asked. if lx. Willian Harvey was removed

The facts are-that in June 1963 he was assigned

as our

Chief

Stati

in

SA2EST.020.08

and in February of '67 he was

.. noti

reassigned to CIA Headguartors. He retired

voluntarily under

our retirement system on 31 of December 1967.

If I may, there is a reasor why he was taken out and if I

could go off the record and mention that to the Committce. It

is a matter of his privacy.

Chairman Church. Very well, off the record.

(Off

the record discussion)

Mr. Colby.: Back on the record.

Senator Schweiker asked me whether Howard Hunt or James

Mocord were in charge of Mexican operations at the time of

President Kennedy's assassination on 22nd of November '63.

Howard Hunt fron. "July '62 to August '64 was assigned as a

Section Chief in the Division of Plans Directorate, which is

now the Operations Directorate at CIA Headquarters, which had

responsibility whatsoever for Mexican operations.

Senator Schweiker. What were those dates again?

Mr. Colby. July '62 to August "61.

Senator Schweiker. Hasn't he at some point in Mexico

City and in charge of that office?

Mr. Knoche. Way back in the 150's he served ir Mexico

City. Way back. He was not in charge.

Senator schiziker. So that is the pariod you are saying

he had no jurisdiction in any way with Latin Argrica or Mexicor

Affairs.

Mr. Colby. No, he was in what we call, and we have since

changed the name, to Domestic Operations Division at that time,

our operations here in this country, and that is a whole

different subject I would have to explain some day.

Mr. McCord Erom June '62 to June '64 was assigned as a

CIA security officer in one OTA Statio at

and he had no responsibilities for Mexican operations at that

point.

Senator Morgan last time asked what infornation was given

to the Warren Commission concerning Agency assassination plans

conccrning Castro, and I have been advised our records do not

indicate that the Warren Connission was provided with informa-

tion on this subject.

Allen Dulles, of course, I would note, who was the CIA

Director until the fall of

'61, was a member of the Harren

Conmission, but beyond thet fact I have nothing I could offer.

And then who made the decision not to provide it, it none

was given? Our records do not indicate that there was a CIA

decision on this matter not to tell the warren Commission.

I could add that I beliave the ralationship with the

Warren Cornission was handled by ore of our staffer optich

I cannot say that for sure, but I know the compartmentation

system was such.

Chairman Church. What was the name of the CIA agent who

was given the responsibility for liaison between the CIA and

the Warren Commission?

hir. Colby. To my knowledge it is Mr. Raymond Rocca.

Chairman Church. Where is it now?

Mr. Colby. He retired at the end of December of last year.

He remained working for us for a few months. I think he is

retired. I think he is retired. I beliove he is still in

the washington area.

Mr. Knocke. Yes, he is still working with us.

Mr. Colby. Still working with us to help on the transi-

tion of the whole counter intelligence program.

Chairman Church. Why did he retire?

Mr. Colby.. That was the Angleton case, Mr. Chairman, and

the facts of that case were that I had had some professional

differences in the organization with Mr. Anglston as to the

way the counterintelligence business was run and the way the

Israeli account was handled. I belisved that it required a

higher degrce of coordination of the other slements of the

Directorate and of the Ageroy. Ha had debated this on various

occasions in thr past. I did reorganize that staff in 1973 aro

too: a nunbar of functiors isay from it. The

endeavored to open un the Isracli account to a better Iciation-

ship with our ohior dear Eastern activitics. He dabated this

over many months and on several occasions. We could never

really ayree to it because he insisted on the inportance of

retaining it where it was.

Mr. Angleton had done a very good job of establishing that

liaison years ago and knew a lot of the senior Israeili who

were involved in it.

I believed there was inadequate coordination in the Arab

areas.

Also, I believed that there vas a undue degree of compart-

mentation of that staff, that it needed more interchange with

our other divisions.

We debated this and discussed it and i

set as my time limit for this discussion the end of December.

because there were some very substantial retirement benefits

that people would loose if they stayed after that point.

Ther

unfortunately the Seynour Hirsh article of Decenber 22nd came

to our attention before it was actually published, and so I

brought Mr. Angleton up and said that I was going to make tro

•basic decisions. I was going to move the Israeli account from

his control and I was going to put some sucessor leadership

into the Head of the Countarintelligence Staff. I said I would

offer him a post of tying together some counterintelligence

doctrine, he could stay woting with us.

He did not have

chose to retire. I insisted that I talk to him before the

seymour Hirs- article appeared.. I knew it was coning. I

didn't know what it was going to say. I wanted to make cicar

between him and me that the decision was based upon our long-

standing discussion of how to run that particular activity.

The question then came up who would be his succassor and

MI. Rocca was his Deputy. There were two other officers who

were possibilities. One of the officers, Mr. Hood, had said

in early December that he planned to retire at the end of

December.

The other two, Mr. Rocca and fir. Miler, were infornad

that they would

not be the successor chiaf of that state.

They

ware offered a chance to stay on in their then current jobs.

They chose to retire. All four of them agreed to stay with

us on a consultant basis over

the next several months to help

us on the transition of new leadership into that job, and they

have done so.

Chairman Church. Well, without getting off the track,

just have one further question here in connection with Mr.

Angleton himself.

Is it true that he is still being paid as a consultant?

Mr. Colby. I believe it has dropped off, Mr. Chaizian.

He did help us for three or four months but I believe that it

is terminated. It is about time to termirats it, I know, ard

wether it is on this particular date has been

teennatod.

Mr. ColDy. Absolutely not. It was to help us get over

Chairman Church.

Very well.

Senator Hondale: I asked for vouchers on payments with

respect to assassinations?

Mr. Colby. I am looking for that. I don't have an answer

for you yot, Senator.

The request was also made whether we had any information

concerning plots to assassinate Chou En Lai. He have irports

of two such examples, incidents, both conducted by the Chinese

Nationalists without our prioi knowledge and without our

participation.

One in Aptril 1955, an Air India aircraft crashed at

i off Indochina after departing from Hong Kong. Several

Chinese communist delegates for the Bandung Conferenca were

on board and it had been runored that Chou En Lai rould he on

the aircrait.

On the 1lth of January 1956, the British Colonial Ostice

in London issued an official statement reporting they had

evidence that the Chinese Nasionalists had bribed a Hong kong

airport: employce to place a timo horb on the airplana.

had Flcd to. Taivan. We had nothing to do with that incident

and frankly heard about it after it occurred.

In the fall of 1956, a senior Chinesa Nationalist Gificial.

informed an officer of CIA that a Chinese National plannad to

assassinate Chou En Lai during his visit to Cambodia in •

Novenber '56 and had been thwarted by the Cambodian arrest of

the Chinese Nationalist officer sent to. Phnom Penh to supervise

the attempt. We learned of this after it had happared and se

had nothing to do with

it.

We had a relationship with the Chinese Nationalists

intelligence servica over the years and they clearly have done

things without our knowledge or involvament, and in a number

of areas, but we have also worked together on some areas.

These are two that were separate.

Also I was asked to look at the photographs of lioward Hurt

and Sturgis that appeared in wawsweek some years ago. We

obtained this photograph from the FBI last night about 5 o'cloc!.

We had not had it before.

We had a copy of the Newsweek

examined them in considerable detail, and talking about the

lot of sortof fundamental differences in the kinds of •

appearances

they have, different characteristics of the

individuals.

With respect to Sturgis, of course, we are not as confi-

dent bacause we don't have as good a base to work from in our

comparison but at the same time we see differences there also.

were able

to do a preity good job on lunt and, what they do is

identify certain key points, make measurements and put adjust-

ments, the same thing we do for the satellite photography in

terms of these

measurements, and things like that, and compare

it in that sense, and their conclusion: is that clearly this is

not Hunt. They are absolutely confident that this photograph

is not. Hunt. They are less confident that it is not Sturgis

because of the base on which they are operating, but they think

it is not.

I point out that this analysis was done overnight, about

Mr. Colby.. They can do that kird of a turn through the

around?

feront pose. They turned his mouth dow.. His syes are closed

They have really done a job if they changed s to that lower

right.

Mr. Colby. They can change then, honest.

Let me gat my brief on that and I will answer that

question.

They magnified them to the same scale using the eyes and

mouth. The contrast and texture differences were minimized,

continuous tone photographs employed and angular compensations

were made to offset errors incident to the different heads.

they can mix them around in that kind of fashion.

chairman church. Just one thing I would like to say to

you, ir, Colby, before I forget it. You have made reierence

to the Israeli account and the special way that it had been

handled under ir. Angleton. Before we finish our review with

you of covert operations we vould like to have a more detailed

statement of that matter.

Mr. Colby. Right.

- Chairman Church. And I think you should prepara to

discuss it with us and we will have further questions to

ask

you in connection with it.

I just wanted to give you notice.

HI. Colby. Right. In our lexicon it doesn't count as a

covert action but that is all right, no problem, I will cover

it.

investigation?

Mr. Colby. Sure, no problem.

The only other one thirg I would like to suggest for the

record, Mx. Chairman, with respect to the discussion of the

attempts made against Mr. Castro, in no way justifying then.

My position on this is quite clear. I do think it important

to put that exercise in the context of the times, which was

the times of the Bay of Pigs, which was a decision made by

the Government. The Cuban missile crisis, and following that,

a program approved by our normal covert action approval mecha-

rism to try to generate all overthrow of Mr. Castro fron within

cuba by assisting various groups to go in with sabatage and

by putting economic pressure on the country, and so forth.

That went on for a number of years after the 1961-62 episodes

and I think it does put a cover of policy attitude toward Cuba

and toward MI. Castro that is an important factor in evaluat-

ing the thing, without in any way justifying the particular

attempts to assassinate hin.

Senator Hart of Michigan.

But was there any evaluation

done at or about the time of that Cuban missile crisis?

Mr. Colby. There was an evaluation done after the Bay

of pigs, a rather intensivé Investigation Internal Security

Branch Review of the activity and then the Cuban missilo

crisis came along shortly thereafter before anything very much

got going. Thorcafter, however, a nurser or programs ver

conducted, which I am sure the Committee night want a general

summary of. I am just giving you one sort of a paragraph

summary of it, which were aimed at putting economic pressura

on Cuba in the hopes that this would put pressure against him

and lead to its disorder and problems there and, secondly, to

encourage rovolutions, sabotage and so forth, from within

Cuba through a variety of programs of propaganda, support of

exile movements, landing of teams on the coast, things of this

nature.

Chairman Church. The difficult with this is, as I see it

although, what you say is true, once an agency begins to engaga

in assassination attempts the disease spreads. Your own

testimony shows it spread

at least as far as the Dominican

Republic and we are going to get into closer questions on

other matters such as Lmumba and Chile.

So that I don't think this issue can be confined really :

to the emergency that did in fact exist between the US and

Cuba and the seriousness of that emergency at the time.

Mr. Colby.

I agree with you, ir. Chairman. I am against

it and have been against it for a long time, but nonetheless

I think in fairness to the people involved at that period

think it is important to give total contest.

Chairman Church.

Yes.

to dotermino, assuning internally the ciA might have costomplate

additional efforts to assassinate Castio after the Bay of Pigs,

after the missile crisis, it would not have acted unless direct:

by the very

highest authority, would it?

Mr. Colby. That is not that clear, Senator Hart. I think

the evidence we have is that the then Director was not asarc

of some of these activities and, therefore, one would have

very difficult time saying that it was pursuant to a specific

authorization. It was consistent with an overall policy which

was the point I was saying, but nonetheless I think the spe-

cific action we cannot say was approved even within the Agercy

at the Director level.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Is there any indication that

the Director, who did know of at least an earlier attempt -

is there any indication that following the Bay of Pigs, or

föllowing the missile crisis, ha explicityly brought the sub-

ject up for review?

• Mr. Colby. There is one documentary evidence that Mr.

McCone dictated in 1967, I believe it was, in which he recourtad

being informed of a meating, of an inter-Agency meeting at

which the subject of assassination was raised, and he made a

particular point of indicating after the meeting -- he was

not at the meating; I believe, but he heard of the meeting aid!

he made a particular poirt of saying he disapproved of this

it referred, to an attached nemorandum which I think you said

I gather you have a copy of that, but you don't feel

Mr. Colby. I do have

a

copy of it. The understanding

we have had with the other

agencies is that each of us gives

our own material but we refer to the other agency for any

documents belonging to the other agency.

Chairman Church. Well, it is very difficult for the

Conmittee to operate that way. I think that since the Committes

is entitled to this information, that when it is pertinent

and as we proceed in our haarings from one subject to another,

we ought to be able to secure the information without having

to go back through executive channels.

Mr. Colby. May I undertake to get the permission to give

it to you? I will undertake to do this today.

Chairman Church. Any observations that the Comnittee

wishes to make on this kind of a problem?

It is the first cime it as come up.

Senator llart of Colorado. Is this the understanding we

have had or rot?

Mr. Schwarz. It has been a total frustration to the staff

and I am very happy it has come up here because wa get chasta

around the corner by one agency to another. It is called the

"third agency rule." It was intended to have nothing to do

with congressional hearings. Obviously, it had to do with

declassification to the public, and it. has happened to completel

delay our ability to gat information because ve go at one agency

and then they determine that it really isn't their documant

or it mentioned some other agency, and then we have to go to

the other •agency-.

This is an example of how frustrating it is.

Senator Mondale. Have we tried to gat this document from

the NSA?

Mr. Colby. No; this particular document had just come up

on Wednesday --

Senator Schweiker. Does the counsel have any suggastions

as to what he feels the Committee vosition should be in this

area to enable him and staff to do an effective job?

Mr. Schwarz. I think the Committee's position ought to be

that pertinent information should be produced by any agency

that possesses it, and if thay wish to inform another agency

that they are doing it, ther that is their business. But

think thuy should have to picduce it if they possess

it.

Chairman Church. All

we know is the subject of assassina-

tions apparently came up in the course of the mecting.

Mr. Colby. Mr. Chairman, as one of the agerciss involved,

if I could offer one explanation for the Third Agency Rule

avun in this circumstance. And I am particularly interested in

this because sometimes our documents have material whose

sensitivity is not apparent on the face and we assume that this

will be handled in certain compartmented channels, and if it

gets out of the compartment it might give problems that the

individual at the other end wasn't aware of. That is the

basis for the rule. The thought being go back and ask the

originator, and he has a feeling for that and could make the

particular case if something particularly sensitive is involved

Chairman Church. I would suggest, Mr. Colby, without

binding the Committae to a precedent, with respect to dealing

with the Third Party Rule, that in this case you undertake

to

secure from the NSA --

Mr. COlbY. I will.

Chairmar. Church. -- its permission to turn this particular

document over to the Committee so it may be made a part of these

hearings.

Mr. Colby. I will endeavor to do that today, Mr. Chairman.

Senator Morgan. Do wa have that?

Mr. Schwarz.

It was shown to us on Madnesday, marked

or deemed marked as part of the record, and raturned to the CIA

who returned it to us today.

Mr. Colby. I have another copy of it.

Senator Mondale. It refers to a meeting in Mr. Rusk's

office at which presumably. Novamara and Rusk, I gather from tha

later mano, and locona ware present, and it says this.

"I called Lansdale's office and ir his absence pointso is

to Frank Head the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this

typs of comment in writing in a document. The words he objected

to wars including liquidation of leaders. I advised him as

far as CIA was concerned we would write no document pertaining

to this and would participate in no open meeting to discuss

it."

I read that to mean we will go ahead and do it but we don't

want anything in vriting and don't want to be in a meeting where

it is going so lund. Thai mares a 10t of sense. No livirg

politicion wants to bo associated with an assassination, sver.

if he wants someone assassinated. I thirk that is conmon sense.

That is why I think these documents are so crucial.

Chairman Church; Of course they are crucial and we must

have them.

The ambiguity, however, that we have yet to clear up is

in the third paragraph, Senator liondale, where the memorandum

reads the question of assassination, particularly of fide?

Castro, was brought up by Secretary McNamara at a meeting of

the special group augmented in Secretary Rusk's office in

August. It was the obvious consensus

at that meeting, in

answer to a comment by lir. Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject

which has been made a mattar-of official record, the subject

being the question of assassiration.

Now, that leaves us still without any documentary proof

that it was revealed at this meeting that the CIA was in fact

engaged in an effort to assassinate.

Senator Mondale. Was Lansdale working for the CIA at

this tina?

.

Mr. Colby. Pardon?

Senator Mordale. Has General Lansdale working for the

CIA at this time?

Mr. Colby, General Lansdale was Assistant to the Secretary

of Defense, not CIA, at that time.

there is a standard operating procedure of your Agency an

not to make notes, an effort for certain individuals

not to have certain knowledge by design.

For irstunce, I sas reading your menorardun here dated

You make a point to say that you brielad someone orally.

Tha

word "orally" is in there - assuming that for the purpose

someone should krow that you did not put anything in writing

or you did not give him a writter. report.

You also say that I personally managed to avoid gaining

any knowledge of what precise

actions were taken.

I think a reasonable

infarence there is that there is a

deliberate on your part here

-- and maybe this is standard

operating procedure - for you not to gat spacific information

so that you always will be in the position of rot knowing sona-

thing.

: Mr. Colby. I don't racogniza the reference. Cartainly,

think in past years there ware situations we did not want

to conmit to writing.

There is a great deal of effort made by us to what wa

call compartment information so that it is known only to certain

paople and not known to others. The compartment is still to

be open at the top, however.

There are things that I purposily try not to krow.

ought to mark it as an exhibit.

Let's numbar as today's number, and wa have put in the

threa charts so far, and wa will call this, which is thei

June 1973 memorandum for Hr. Millian E. Colby, subjact special

activities, from stamped pages 00.157, 00158, and 00159, 0f

the so-called 694 pages.

The documunt abova referred to was

The

reason it was addressed to hilliam E. Colby is we

were going through that period in the middle of 1973 where I

was technically, I guess, Director of Operations but had been

nominated to bacone Diroctor. This was the kind of thing that

normally would be addressed to the Director but we had an

Acting Director, General Walters, but it was pretty clear I

was responsible for making the machinery run and we had a lot

of things around the Agency addressed to me and signed by me.

I believe this follows a conversation I had with a Mr.

Walter Elder, who was an Assistant to Mr. John McCone -- he

was Executive Assistant when he was Director -- I think Mr.

Elder told me

that there were certain things that he knew of

in the background that related to this effort of identifying

various quastiorable activitias of the Agency, and I asked

him to go write them down so we could get them into the

Inspactor General's report.

Senator ludalsston. The only question I raise, I don't

want to gat off into the contents of a particular memorandum,

but the context with the area you were pursuing, just whether

or not standard operating procedurs would require at times

there be a deliberate avoidance by certain peopla in the

Agency of facts and whather or not there is a great body of

decisions that are made and implemented without anything writter

down, so that trore would never be any documantary evidence

ТОнО

of it?

Mr. Colby. Well, I think that you certainly can say that

there

Is an avoidance by a lot of paople of learning things

that they are not authorized to know. I mean the more loyal

in a sense of our enployees, say that thay have authority to

know what it going on in, say, Cuba, they don't have a right

to know what is going on in, say, China, and they rather

carefully keep themsalves fron learning what is going on in

China. I think that is a pravalence.

I think the question you are asking, however, is whether

we are trying to keep activities off of paper and it is pratty

clear that the assassination story vas essentially kept off

the paper:

And I would think that is about the only one. No, the

drug thing. I assuna some of that was kept off of paper?

Mr. Breckinridga. Yas.

Mr. Colby, The lesson that I hava frequently given to

my colleagues in the bureaucracy is that however hard you try

to keep it off of paper, you will not succeed in a bureaucracy,

somebody will write it down and, therefore, it is a totally

Leckless exercise to pretend that you can keep it sacret by

not writing it down. But the fact is there were situations

in which a conscious effort was made in the past to keep things

off the Iucord.

Senator Huddleston.. To sum up, you, as Director, with the

excuption of individual names for which there would be nont. ford

particular value to you and no advantage to you knowing, excops

for that you make no deliberate effort not to krow about

operations?

Mr. Colby. No. As a matter of fact, I take the opposite

position, Senator. I say that to my subordinates and have

reiterated a number of times, I cannot ba subjected to surprisa.

You have got to let me know the things I ought to know.

And

I have undertaken the same obligations to my oversight committass

for example, that I am responsible getting to them bafore

they hear about it some place else.

Senator Huddleston.

The other is in this inquiry. Can

the Committee expect that every effort will be nade to supply

to us information about various things, even though they may

not be written down?

Mr. Colby. You have my commitment to that effect.

Senator Huddleston. Going further and looking through

the files

¡ir. colby, It is my hope, Serator, that I can help you

on this investigation rather than defending myself against you.

Now, Senator Mondale.

Senator Mondale. The mamorardum fron John Accone tbat

ve received this morning, dated 14 April, 1357, is addresser

to the Director.

Has McCore an employee or related with the CIA at that

time?

Mr. Colby. No, he left in 1965.

Senator Mondale. So this was a memorandum from a person

so longer with the CIA, as former Director to the current

Director, which begins

"no

memorardum can be located covering

the August, '62 meeting."

That is the one that aaxlier says the question of

assassination was discussed. However, it is highly probable

that one exists.

Now, I would like all documentation, records, and notes

that bear on the question of what icCone was raferring to,

bacause I gat the impression that the then Director, Mr. Tielms

Mr. Colby, Yes.

Senator Mondale.

- was reviewing the question of documantar

tions and records affecting that meating, or the question of

assassination, and I think ve nead to know what transpired,

what was happening then, what kind of responses ha received.

Mi. Coloy. We will' curtainly give you that.

I can give

you a basic explanation.

This

exercise stanned from the revelasion in Jack.

Anderson's columis, I belisve, of our relationship with the

rafia figures at that time. This then generated the relest

to 1r. Breckinridge to do an Inspector Ganeral's report of

this whole subjact, which he did, and which we will cartainly

make

available to this Committee...

In the course of it, and with the publicity, fir. Mccore,

who does

maintain an occasional contact with the Agency, he

is a friend of it and an ex-Director - I see him every now

and again and try to sort of kaep him up with what is going

on in general terms without gatting into political or sensiziva

matters or anything -- but he doas maintain this contact and

I am sure that somebody made contact with him or he made contact

with the Agency about the Jack Anderson column, and that then

generated this particular memorandum.

Sanator Mondale. And there was an Inspector General's

study done at that time?

MI. Colby. Yes, sir; and you will get accass to that.

Senator Mondale. Can we have documentation as to how

it was originated and the response to what was done?

Chairnan Church. Yes, we should have that information.

And I might say that you are aware, no doubt, that charges have

been made that documents have been destroyed in the CIA which

may have been connected with the goneral subject of cIA toro

involvamont in assassination efforts.

Can you tell this Committee whother, to your knowledge,

Mr. Breckinridge. I think we can talk in terms of what

we know is there.

On the Castro assassinatior, the involvement with the

Mafia, there ware a few menoranda in the Offica of Security,

and I think you have copias of those.

.. ........... ....

On the sacond phase of that, there are practically no

records at all and our invastigation at that time was made

entirely on intervievs.

Based entirely on interviews,

an attempt to reconstruct

that activity.

The final action which involved a Cuban by the name of

Cuballa --

Mr. Colby. This was tha Cuban major we discussed last

time.

Mr. Breckinridge.

Started in the minds of the people

who yere involved, was an attempt to generate an internal

political action, revolt, and the records are very full because

there was no attention on the part of the people who vere

involved at that time that that would be an assassination in

the sensa that the original work with the Mafia was engaged in

and there is a full record. and that exists today.

In the case of the Doninican Espublic, this developeo

I will go back to the Cubella case.

In the instance of the Doninican Republic, the record

was vury full then and it is still very full today. I am

certain that record is complete.

Again, in the minds of the people who were involved, they

drew a line between the support they gave to the coup group

and conscious association with assassination as such. Those

records are complete and those records were developed at the

time and thay were retained.. It was in the pariod of the

The records are practically non-existent and I balieve

Harvey, who conducted the second phase of that, at the

time of our investigation had a handful of cryptic notes that

only he could interpret. We couldn't interpret thein. And

it is my understanding that those notes no longer exist. They

were retained by him and he brought them in at the time that

we were questioning him. He was then on sick leave prior to.

Those notes were totally unrevealing.

I think that thosa records are in the same state today...

point that on the very day of Presidant kennedy's assassination

a man was meeting with Cubella in Paris, and in rcsponse to

Cubella's request offered him an assassination davice that at

the tine of the investigation we understood he accepted but

I have sinca been told he did not accept. It was a ballpoint

pen converted into a syzings for injecting poison.

Subseguantly, arms were harded to Cubella by a Cuban

refugee in Madrid, in the very carly part of 1965, and two.

catches were put down by boats off Cuba for Cuballa. I think

he may have recovered one of those but not the other. Tha

racords on that are pratty complete.

so, genarally speaking, on those things where the Agency

was involved, with the exception of the association with the

Mafia, where from the beginning the intent was assassination,

the records are complete, and I think that if people 100k ai

those they will find this is so.

Mr. Schwarz. Is the understanding that all racords dealing

with this subject, whather they are in Inspector General,

reports or underlying documents, would be producad for our

inspection?

Hi. Colby. Xes.

If I may ask only the Committee's consideration of

possibly some individual nanes in it that wa would hope that

outside of the Agency.

It was during a visit to the Agarcy and he

had tha banafit of his ex-stalf assistant, ir. Walter Elder,

was developed of keeping some acoronic pressure on Cuba, and

that was

a natioral policy, not just a CIA -- keaping an

-cononic pressure on Cuba and continuing to support the

various elsments which might eventually lead to a change ir

tha Cuban goverment through some ovarthrow or otherwise.

I think sons propoganda programs usre kept up, some exila

activities vere kept up, sone training of teams to be infil-

trated into Cuba vare tapt up, some sabotage operations vere

continued. ind those continued over the following several

months. .

Right after the 1962 missila crisis -- I cannot identify

right offhard here any particular revisw of that - but I

know that that was a subject of 40 Committee consideration at

various times.

Whether that included assassiration of not I cannot say.

My guess, as I say, is that if John McCone didn' know

about it, it was not covered in those discussions because it

would be very hard to cover them without his being irvolved.

Mr. Breckinridge. I am not familiar with that study.

I am familiar with the approach that was taken at the time

withir our organization when the Inspector General.-- I vas

not involved. in that study but I have heard it discussed

how they approached it.

Their understanding of the 3ay of Pigs problem was the

overall invasion plan and organization for that and concentrates

on that.

By way of explanation for the omission of reference to

the assassinations, so faw people knew about it, and I thin!:

it came to no one's attention - simply did not discover it

at that tine. And it may not have been by way of explanation,

not a justification. It may not have been associated in the

minds of the people who did know about it with the inguiry

into the military operation.

Mr. Brechinridge. Right.

HI. Schwarz. And Mr. Dulles, at least the records ve

put in on fednesday, knew about in and he was substantially

involved in the Bay of Pigs. 2h0se gentlemen surely would have

been questioned by General Taylor and Attorney General Kennedy

Is that fair?

Mr. Breckinridge. I would assume so.

Mr. Colby. Certainly, yes. But again, if the focus

was

on the military operation, it might have been that that other

operation was not irvolved in it.

Mr. Schwarz. The record further shous that on May 7, 1962,

a mesting was held with Attorney General Robert Kennedy in

which the contemporancous document describing that meeting

indicates that he was rot told that there was a contizuirg

and ongoing operation, but rather was told of something which

was not called an assassinatio. but was called a projec:

was told of something which was referred to ir the past tense;

is that right?

MI. Colby. It was in the past tense. Whether there was

any other discussion in that meeting on this subject is just

don't know.

about it.

Mr. Schwarz. Ever though it continued to involve the

Mafia until early. 1963?

Mr. Breckinridge. That is corrsct. Colonel Edwards no

longer knew what was going on. So when he briefad the Attorney

General ha did not know that this second operation, this

reactivation of

the operation that had formerly run under his

responsibility - he did not know that it was orgoing.

Mr. Schwarz. Who was responsible for the selection of

Colonel Edwards and Ganeral Counsel Houston as being the

persons who would go to brisf Atiorney General Kennedy?

Mr. Breckinridge. I am not sure I know that.

Mr. •Schwarz. It would have been sonsore of higher

authority within the CIA; is that correct?

Mr. Breckinridge.

He have tried to determine.

No. Houston, if I understand it, feels that he would not

have done this unless he thought tha Dirictor knew.

Mr. Schwarz.

Knew what?

Mr. Breckinridge.

Knaw that he was going to do this. Bus

25

he did not talk to ch= Director about it.

I gather that it is not all that clear in Colonel Edwares'

either at this point in time.

Mr. Schwarz. So someone selected these persons to go

No. Brackirridge.

Correct.

it.

Mr. Schwarz.

Can we determine than who was responsible

for. selecting those persons to brief Attorney General Kernedy,

instead of including in the group other parsons who knew that

the Mafia part of the assassination attempt was ongoing?

Mr. Brschinridge. I don't think that we can now.

_As I say, there is no written recora.

Mr. Schwarz. Who could it have been?

iho was in a

higher position of authority, in a position to make a decision

as to who should briel Attorney General Kennedy?

- May I Isconstruct because nuch of my understanding is busi

on my analysis of what happened and not on clear facts.

The FBI approached Colonal Edwards when their investigation

and incident in Las Vegas eventually produced his name, and

his conversations, I think, vere with the General Counsel at

that time.. I cannot reconstruct beyond that so I really can't

give you ar answer to the specific questior. But the initiative

came fron tha FBI. Colonel Fawards and Mi. Houston discusssa

it. III. Houston, I have been told, believes that tha director

must have known.

ir. Schwarz: Which Director are we talking about?

Mr. Breckinridge. Whoever the Director was at thai tims?

Mr. Colby. By that time.

Mr. Schvarz. Of what agency?

Mx. Colby. CIA. That would have been McCone.

Mr. Breckinridge. He operated on the assumpsion that ir.

Mccone knew.

Mr. Schwarz. Knew what?

No. Breckinridge.

Knew that they were going to brief the

Attornsy General.

Ir. Breckinridge. The record ou this is very unsatisfactor

Chairman Church. You see, the state of the record lin:

now

suggasts a cover-up, arothar cover-up. It suggasts that

those who were selected

I by the higher authority in CIA to

bries the Abtorney General had knowledge limited to an attemp:

on the life of Castro that had been concluded.

It further suggests that they had no knowledge of continuing

efforts then underway, even though presumably their superiors

did hava such knowledge. This leaves the Attorney General ir.

a position of being told about the past program and nos baina

told about. the present program, and we know that he later said

to certair assistants of his that he had put a stop to

assassination attempts on Fidal Castro and he may have been

left with the impression, as

a result of this meeting, that

there were no further attempts. lis may have said he wanted

further attempts. We don't krow. But clearly he was not told

that there were further attempts then underway.

Senator Morgan. Were we told yesterday or the day before

Yesterday, that he knew of the Cuban majors' operation?

Hir. Schwarz. We were not told that.

Mr. Breckinridge. I canno: clarify the quastion completely

but I can introduce a little bis more.

When the discussion occurred Mr. Houston did go and talk

with General Carter, who was then the Daputy Director

Nr. Schwarz. Which discussion are we talking about now?

To, go back, hor the question arose, and it goes far afiela,

John Roselli, who was the Chicago member of the Mafia who

arranged the introduction of Giancanato the Cuban syrdicate

head, through.whom they initially tried to run this operation --

Giarcana

had a personal love affair with a well know entertainer.

who was then in las Vegas, and she was suspected by him of then

having an affair with another well known entertainer.

Giancana went. to Robart Maheu, through whom these introduc-

tions were first made -

Mr. Schwarz. Introduced to the Mafia personnel?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes.

Mr. Colby. Between CIA and the Mafia.

Mr. Breckinridge. And asked Maheu toarrange to have the

room of the male entertainer in Las Vegas hugged. They hired

a private detoctive who ther did this. The roommate stumbled

on the equipment, the private detective was arrested, and the

FBI investigativa trail led from the private detective to Maheu

to Giancana and eventually to CIA. Giancana had insisted that

Haheu help him because he had holped Maheu with the introduction

to the head of the Cubar syndicate, and Maheu had then agreed

to get a private detective to do it.

so this arose in the context of a domesticviolation of

wirstapping laws and the FBI was investigating it on that hasis.

Because the trail led to fiancana androselli, who vai

werc high on the FRI list, as they progressed towards developing

a prosecution, they came to Colonel Eduards, the FBI did, and

said what is your position on this. The position of the Agency

as stated by Colonel Edwards was we did not want them prosecuted

because it would expose what he understood to be this operation,

and I guess the time sequence gets a liitle fuzzy in my mina.

Mr. Schwarz.

Did he tell the Director of the FBI the

nature of

the operation, or simply he told him it would concern

some sensitive matter?

Mr. Breckinridge. He told him it was an intelligence

operation in country, and the Mafia was being used for that

purpose.

so in the discussions as it progressed, it dealt with

the wiretap prosecution. Colonel Edvards in discussing it

with us in 1967, according to our notes, said that they briefed

the Attorney General all the way, but at that time Colonel

Edwards, I think by the time they did it, Colonel Edwards thought

it was over. So the Attorney General and the FBI were not told

the complete story.

Nr. Schwarz.

They weren't told the nost important part

of the story, and that was that it was continuing.

Mr. Breckinridge. They didn't know that, that is corioct.

Chairman Chuich, So you have here two violations of law.

Mr.

Breckinridge. We didn't learn about this until after

the FBI found out about the Mafia involvement in that wiretap.

Senator llart of Colorado. Was the CIA not concerned that.

Giancana inay have told somethin about this Cuba: operation to

the femala entertainer who also may have told the mala

entertainer?

Ir. Breckinridge. No. If I understand what happyned,

and I an now describing what ix. Mahou said, and I get this

fron having Icad some files at the Department of Justice

recently - when Mr. Maheu tried to explain to the FBI his

position and tried. to provide a rational+ for doing this, ha

said I thought thare was a leak in Chicago and I wanted to have

the room of this entertainer bugged so I could find out if

Giancana had leaked.

The FBI gave this the kind of cradit I think it was entitled

to. They didn't pay much attention to it. This was something

he tried to develop to justify his involvement.

There is no indication that there were any leaks from

Chicago that we know of, sonathing that he would know of, ars

there was no instruction on our part for him to do such a thiry,

and it was for anothar reason Giancana asked him to do it.

Serator Hart of Colorado. As far as you can tell from tha

racord, the CIA was not concarned that Giancana and his fanals

friend, or her male frierd, may have bloun the Cuban operation?

was briefed on the full datails of the assassination plot.

So while ha did approve their going and briefing the Attorrey

General about this association with the lafia, there is no

indication that he was told the full story then eithar.

Mr. Schwarz. Then in August of 1963, the document that

you providad for us last time, fir. lialms dia know about tha

ongoing operation; is that correct?

Mr. Breckinridge. I think by then he knew that thes

operation was going.

he knew, that is just an assumption on your part, that you

don't have any positive evidance?

MI. Breckinridge. That is correct.

Serator Horgan. The truth is you sort of suspect they

all knew what was going on. Don't you think that is true?

Mr. Breckinridge. No, not necessarily.

When we conducted our investigation ve interviead the

people directly involved in the operation, those that were

didn't assume that they didn't know, you just said there is

Mr. Breckinridge. That is corect.

Senator Schweicker. Let me ask the question another way.

The documentation you collected and what you do have

positively, who was the highest ranking official, according

to your records, who knaw?

Chairman Church. According to the positive documents

that you have of knowledge.

Mr. Breckinridge. First, let me say we did not have

documentatior. It was based mostly on interviews, this

period involving the Mafia.

The highsst person that wa understood that knew during

the first phas= with ir. Bissel. That we clearly did know

about it? There was discussion at one point in which ir

Bissel, Colonal Edvards, the two of tham, mat with lix. Dulles

ard had a conversation in which I can best say there was

doubletalk as to what they were discussing.

It is open to questior. bow clearly this was stated

while they had met with ir. Dulles, that the corversation was

rot in precisa terns.. As Colonel Savards said to us, we

didn't use.any bad words, which meant they didn't use the

word "assassination,".

but thay discussed an operation against

Castro in-such terms that he felt that they had conveyed the

massage to Mr. Dulles. But there is room for doust.

Senator Schweicksr. Once Mr. Dulles left the Agency, wo

then

became the highest rankiry person to know, according

to your investigation?

Hr. Breckinridge. If Me. Dulles did in fact urderstand,

he would be the highest person at this point.

Senator Schweicker. At this point. Bus he left the

Agency in 1001. Five years of assassination attenpts ventonio

after that.

You conducted an irvestigation in 1967. What did that

period show as to who was the highest ranking person who knew?

Colonel Edvards beliaves that ir. Dulles understood the

conversation.

He also said that he angaged in doubletalk so

that there was room for misunderstanding.

Mr. Schwarz.

I sho: you a document stamped 0012, headed

John Roselli and ask you what it is.

MI. Breckinridge: This is a mano prepared in the Office

of Security describiny john Posalli, wio is the first of the

manbers of the syndicate who was used to arrange the introducsici

to the head of the syndicate in Cuba.

Mr. Schwarz.

And writter when?

Mr, Breckinridge. I am not sure. I suspect it was witha

in 1973 but I would have to check.

ir. Schwarz. Does it refer to a Castro assassination

attempt involvirg the Mafia?

Mr. Breckinridge. Does the word "assassination" appear?

I think it rafers to the Malia.

Mir. Schwarz. Do you havs any doubt, in fact, this is

referring to the assassination effort involving taheu,

Rosalli,

Trafficanta, in connection with Castro?

Mr. Breckinridge. That is cortect.

Mr. Schwarz. And does this document prepared by the

Office of Security stata "the DCI was briefed and gave his

approval"?

It does.

- MI. Schwarz. Now, therafore, either Mr. Dulles did approvel

which the document says, or somebody wrote a document in

connection with the investigation which irresporsibly says

Mr. Dulles approved. Which is the case?

Mr. Breckipridg=. I don't think that either is necassaril!

the case.

The understanding of the Office of Security is that Mr.

Dulles does know or did know. The question that was raised

in the course of our inquiry was that the ratura of the maating

as described to us raised a question of doubt. That we did

not Icsolve.

Chairman Church. I think if we accapt your testinoy

that there was at least an element of doubt as to whether or

not it. Dulles knew of the connection batween the CIA and the

Hafia, and its purpose, to assassinate lic. Castro, let's get

back to Senator Schweicker's questior. After Mr. Dulles left

sevefal mors plots were fcined involving the CIA and having ..

to do with subsequent attempts on the life of Castro.

Now, what does your investigation show and what can you

tell us with respect to the highest officials in the CIA,

following the departure of Mr. Dulles, who may have had knowludge

of these ongoing operations? :

ir. Breckinridge. When the operation was renewed I thin:

it is clear that the Diesctor as that time did rot know.

Who was tha Director at that

Chairman Church.

Wher. was the operation reneved?

NI. Breckinridge. The operation was actually reactivated

in ApIil of 1962. It was plarned to be reactivated prior to

that but the employee who had responsibility for it did not

get free until April of '62 whan he actually reactivated it.

There is no indication that anyone above the lavel of Mr.

Bissel in 1961, at the time that this was discussed, there

is no indication that aiyone above his lavel knew that it

was to ba reactivated. This officer, Mr. Harvey, then took

it over and astenpted to run it again through the balance

• MI. Harvey was given the responsibility of this by ir.

Bissel and originally it continued

as a separate action from

the Castro operation, but it. Harvay was also givan that

responsibility, and for all' intents and purposas they became

wedded.

Mr. Helms was the person who formally approved ZR Riale

as a project. ZR. Rifle had a dual purpose that has not been

clarified by our inquiry. It agparently was in fact used for

the stated purposes, as far as organizational activities ent

along, which was to stealcodes, and it. lalms, han ha

approved the project, authorized accounting on cartification,

which meant that rather than the usual vouchers supporting

axpenditures, that the officer involved vould simply certify

that the

money

had been spent and this would be accested.

It had à project, amount of some dollars, $7509 - 510,000

--

soms of it to include the salary of an agant, some to irclua:

operating expenses.

So it: Helms' main appearance in the approval of ZR Rifla

does not necessarily equate with tha date when he became

familiar with the Castro operation.

Mr. Schwarz. Because of the dual purpose of Rifle, Rifle

means both, rifla files and used rifles?

Me. Breckinridge.

It nay mean either or both.

I was out of town yesterday.

- No. Breckinridge. I think that is probably correct.

It

was in the fall of 1961 that Mr. Harvey was given this assignment

by Mr. Bissel. I think Mr. Bissc: left in 1962. I am no:

of the dates,

So Mr. Bissel would have known at that time.

But I am not sure after that.

Chairman Church.

Helms succeeded Mr. Bissel

as chief

MI. Colby. Deputy Director of Plans.

Chairman Church. Deputy Director for Plans.

Your record shows that Helms had knowledge of the 2R Rifle

operation, which, among other things, was to develop an executi.

capability - whatever that neans. Presumably that means a

capability to conduct an assassination if and when authorized

by proper authority?

Mt. Breckinridge. That is my understanding.

Chairman Church. Is that your understanding?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir.

"..

Chairman Church. Do your records show that, or is that

based upon what has been revealed through your interrogation?:

Nr. Breckinridge. First, " let me go back and clarify, then

I will answer this question, if I may.

Mr. Helms approved 'Z? Rifle, which the record showshas the

responsibility of stealing codes, essentially.

also the responsibility for executive action capability.

That

1s a difficult phrase.

The record does not show that Mr. Helms knew when he approveü

the projest that it

had this dual role. So from that poini of

view, I have a record that shows what the project was supposed

to have been as far as its open description, though classified,

and the result of our interviews. with Mr. Harvey which tell the

other story about executive action capability. So it does not,

the record does not show that Mr.Helms at that time knew what

that was.

Chairman Church. If Harvey knew that it had this other

aspect, who would have told him to develop such a capability, i

it were not his superior?

MI. Breckinridge. I think that is a logical conclusion, bus

I was distinguishing what the record showed and what our interviers

developed.

Chairman Church. Didn't you ask. Harvey in interviering

him whether or not Helms had told him to develop this capabille;

as a part of the ZR Rifle?

Didn't you ask him who told him to develop this capability,

or did he do it on his own?

Mi. Breckinridge. Your question is a very proper one, and

my difficulty is with the record which goes back to what Bissel

instructed Harvey to do.

Mr. Schwarz. Bofore licims took the job, Bissel told Harvey

Mr. Schwarz. But he also told him to take charge of the

Castro assassination project using the Mafia; isn't that

correct?

Mr. Breckinridge. Now, there is no record except the

record that came from our interviews on this score. All I

am trying to do is draw the distinction between what the rccord

shows and what our interviews: developed, and there are gaps

in that.

Chairman Church. Your interviews show that Mr. Bissel, who

preceded Helms, told Mi. Harvey to develop an executiva action

capability, which was

a capability to assassinate if and wher

ordered; right?

11x. Breckinridge. That is correct.

Chairman Church. And your records show that ir. Bissel

also Instructed Harvey to take over the Castro assassination

attempt, which was connected with a continuing relationship

betveen the CIA and the Mafia?

Mr. Breckinridge. I think that is a correct assumption, -

yes.

Mr.

Breckinridge. I don't have the accurate date. lie have

the 16 August 1963 memorandum. i promised Mr. Schwarz

that I

would try and fird the date, and I was out of town yestorday

and simply didn't do it. But I have to go through the rucord

to find the earliest date that we have, and I simply have to go

into the record to dig this out.

Senator Schweiker.. Do your records show the date of when

the actual latest assassination attempt, was finished?

Mr. Schwarz. For Castro?

Senator Schweiker. Yes. When was that timeframe, roughly?

Mr. Breckinridge. You are talking about the Mafia connecti!

Senator Schweiker. No; I am talking about when did ve

finally cease and desist in attempting to assassinate Castro,

from your records?

Mr. Breckinridge. Let me, if I may, and I don't mean to

confuse the issue -- the Mafia connection from beginning to end

was an attempt to assassinate Castro. The operation was called

off finally in the Spring, perhaps February, of 1963.

Senator Hart of Nichigan. What year?

MI. Breckinridga. 1963.

Mr. Schwarz. That is the Mafia part?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir. The Cuballa Association has

different origin.

Mr: Breckinridge. Harvey, Harvey decided that it could:'

succecd. Harvey was leaving the country for a foreign assignten

and in conversation with Poselli - Roselli was the man who was

in the Mafia through whon the Agency had continued to work -

and Roselli agreed that nothing was happening, nothing could

happen, and it should be called off. We don't have a record

that larvey went anywhere for approval. This doesn't mean that

he may not have discussed it, but I don't have the record of it.

So Harvey in his conversation with Roselli, terninated the

operation.

Senator Hart of Colorado. The meno which we saw at the

last session, which I don't know ve officially have, 'ir. Colby

made it available to us - was a wrap-up of the whole thing, or a

memo to the files, and I can't recall now who did it.

Mr. Schwarz. That is the one referring to the meeting

with Robert Kennedy that we spent some time lcoking at.

Senator Hart of Colorado. That was the Sheffield-Edwards

meno which say with the collapse of the Bay of Pigs invasion

operation, no fuxther attempt was made with the Mafia. It tied

it directly to the Bay of pigs.

Ir. Colby.. That was the first phase. There was a second

phase that followed with the Mafia.

Chuirman Church. All right, after Harvey left the country

5

who was then assigned

to undertake the subsequent efforts again

: 6

the life of Castro?

Mr. Breckinridge.

This brings us to Senator Schweiker's

8

question. A man by the name of Orlando Cubella, who had been

9

met in Mexico City by the Agency in 1961, who had been one of

10

11

12

the leaders of the anti-Batista groups and held the rank of tajor

in the Cuban

army, that is the highest rank they have, Cuelia

was an M.D. and had been a youth leader and attended youth

13

conferences around the world, and was met first in Mexico City.

14

and later he was met in Scandinavia on several occasions.

And

15

the conversations during these various meetings had to do with

16

Cubella's desire to have a change in Cuba, and the attempt on

17

the igency people who met with him to explore his ability to

18

substitute a. government as well as be able to overthrow the

19

existing government.

20

These conversations

sere very general, exploratory,

and

21

non-productive.

22

23

24

25

In one of the early meetings with Cubella, he taiked about

climinating Castro, and the Agency employee used the word

assassination, which was

reported back as being an ofiensive

word to Cubella, and instructions were issued that Cubella was

He was met in October of 1963, at which time he made the

proposai that he wished to have apons with which to colit

an assassination, and this proposal was rejected.

He continued to speak in these terms, and finally, I cannot

give you the level of approval -- that might be at the level

of ir. Fitzgerald - and I don't recall which job Mr. Fitzgerald

had then, whether he headed the Cuban Task Force or whether he

had becone -

Mx. Breckintidge. Fitzgerald did not give him the pen.

Mr. Schwarz. But discussed the subject?

MI. Breckinridge. I was considering the question of

level of authorization, and I don't recall. I would assume

Mr. Fitzgerald was the highest level of authorization that Im

know of.

Chairman Church. And Fitzgerald's position at that

• time?

Mr. Breckinridge. I was questioning whether he had -- he

had three jobs in fairly quick succession. Whether he roplaced

Harvey as hoad of the Cuban Task. Force, then he becane Chief of

Willi, the western lenispherc Division, and then he became for

a short time Deputy Diroctor of Plans. but he died of a

I don't know whether he had at that time - it wouid

6

Chairman Church, Will you get that for the record?

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.

7

Mr. Breckinridge. The decision was taken to try and give

8

Cubella some instrument. A ball point pen was designed that

9

could be used as a syringe. Because Cubella was a doctor, the

10

11

pen was given to him in Paris on the 22nd of November, 1963,

with the suggestion that he use it.

12

Chairman Church. By whom was the pen given?

13

Mr. Breckinridge. It was given by a case officer of the

14

Agency. In fact, Cubella refused to take it. When we wrote our

15

report, we thought he accepted it, but I've since learned he

26

refused it. He said it was not practical.'

17

Because he was a doctor it was suggested that he could

18

acquice the material to put in the pen, but he refused to accept

19

lit.

20

Conversations continued, and finally the Agency arranged

21

to put down two caches at sea off the coast of Cuba, one of

22

which had weapons in it, one of which had just goneral eguiprent

Mr. Breckinridge. We arranged to have a Cuban refugee

leader meet Cubella in Spain, at which time he gave nim an

additional weapon. That would have been in February of 1964,

I think.

Chairman Church.

What kind of reapon was given to him?

Mr. Breckinridge: It is my recollection it was a rifle.

I

am not sure of that.

Cubella continued to have conversations and meetings fron

time to time as he came out of Cuba, and finally in the middie

of 1965 the decision was taken to cut off contact with him

because there were serious questions about the socurity of his

organization:

Ile was arrested, I think. I think I have gotten my dates

right. It is subject to correction. He was arrested in the

I assure he vas able to return to cuba?

MI. rolby, lie was a Cuban officer at that time, and

apparently loyal to Castro. He would go out on various trips

and things like that, and we would meet him there.

Mr. Schwarz. He was the man who met with Mr. Hunt in

Madrid?

MI. Colby.

He met with a friend of Mi. Hunt. A Cuban exi:

met Cubella in Madrid. That is when the weapons were handed

over.

Mr. Schwarz. ' Was Mr. Hunt in Madrid at that time?

Mr. Colby. Yes.

Mr. Breckinridge. No, because this man by the name of

Artimo, met Cubella in Madrid in December of 1961, and in

February 1965 he made the delivery of the weapons. Hunt was

not assigned there until the middle of 1965, after this was

over.

He don't know where that story came from.

very close, and he is the

things like that. He

may have told him about it.

I would assume that the continuing contac

were

known at a high level, but I have to assume that, and this

goes

to a point when Senator Schweiker was asking the question

at the last tine. This is the last instance that we know of

in which assassination was involved.

Senator Schweiker. That is, both your records and your

interviews indicate that this was the last known activity,

according to your investigation?

Mr. Breckinridge.

That was specifically related to

Castro:

Senator Schweiker. And that date was when?

Mr. Breckinridge.

well, our contact with the Cubella groun

was broken off in June of 1965.

Senator Schweiker.

June of when?

Breckinridge.

1965.

I don't want to confuse you, but I would like to introduce

consideration that relates to this.

Chairman Church. Before

you do that, I have asked what

your investigation shows is the highest officer who knew and

you said you assumed it rust have been known to higher authority.

agent of the CIA gave him a ballpoint pen that had been speciali

designed to camouflage a syringe, and gave it to him with the

recommendation that it would be filled with poison and used to

kill Castro.

Are you saying that the agent may have done this without

way of the other on that.

• Chairman Church. A cache of weapons delivered on the

coast of Cuba hardly constitutes an arsenal by which it reasoni

could be assumed that the government can ba overthrown.

It

doas, however, fit into a schame of providing tha major ard

his cohorts with a capability of assassinating the Cuban Ieader

Mr. Colby. It also coincides with the possibility of

the first step toward additional arms.

I am not denying it, ir. Chairman. I am saying that the

records don't clearly indicate it, and this gets back to Mr.

schvarz's original question to me - can you define "assassica-

tior."?

I would Isspactfully request that I don't get into that

because there is a question as to then you are supporting amed

action and when you are conmitting ar assassination.

Chairman Church. All right. During this whole perica

we understand that the Director of the CIA, Who was ile. liccore,

had said ha had so knowledge of these ongoirg activitias.

Hir. Colby. I would inagine that his testimony that ha

did not know of an assassination would be corsistant with my

comment as to the weapons being given in support of armed aceio:

but not the specific assassination plans. I don't krow that

but I an saying that is a possibla explaration of the differenc

for the recora I would like to say this so I car. remembar why

I was pursuing this later os.

I asked thesa questions not to try to show the assassinaid

if that is all we ars after we can move on to sonathing else.

But the thing that does concern me is that if this prin

continued on until and past the time thai President Kerredy

was

assassinated, then it raises a question in my mird as to

Whether or not Castro hinsalf may not well have knour about it

and thather or not the President's assassication may not have

been a part of a recrimination plan and it may just ober the

door so whether or not later on we should decida to look irto

that.

That is tha reasor. I have folloved that line of questions.

Gerald Ford Library

Senator llart of Colorado. Mr. Colby, in connection with

ZE Rifle, I think you testified of your associate said this was

a multi-purpose operation, including stealing codes, and the

developnent of the capability of what euphemistically is called

executive action.

In your professional judgment, and with your history of

your backyround in the Agency, does it make any sense to you that

a major operation; a major intelligence gathering operation of

the sort of stealing codes, which I assume means from other

governments, would be mounted under the direction of a man

about whom all I know is that it. Harvey has a background of

something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,

I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?

Does it not suggest to you that stealing codes was in

fact an internal cover for what was explicitly an assassination

operation with unlimited, non-voucher financial capability?

Mr. Colby: No, not that it is purely a cover.

In the first place, lt. Harvey had a very successful tour

in sexlin where he ran the berlin tunnel operation, which vas

one of our major successful intelligence operations.

MI. Harvey was a very colorful figure who had his lifestyle,

which is different than some others, but he had been very

cliective it that, and very adventuresome in that category of

signals intelligence and a very centuresome icca

of that nature.

ite was in the assignment of Chief of the FI Division stars.

That staff's major function is to conduct the signals intelligen

work which must be done in the clandestine service.

It hindles our efforts today to penetrate into foreig.

code rooms abroad, and things of that nature, and it involves

the breaking into of safes and things, all that complicated

material.

Now, the thing that puts it together with this "capability"

executive action, is the high degree of compartmentation of

this material, that kind of a project. In other words,

code-breaking, a stealing operation, obviously that is to be

kept very, very secret. If you get caught in it, it has all

::.

sorts of very bad diplomatic implications, and so forth.

Therefore, there is a system of very sharp compartmentation of

the work of that particular group.

You also are dealing with some very venturesome people

whö are willing to cravl into somebody elsels code room and

take the chance of getting caught.

So, given you have a man who had some good technical

experience, who is a venturesome type himself and is running a

program which is not too far off the requirements of high

compartmentation, and a very high risk kind of operation, and

therefore, for Mir. Bissel to have selected llarvey to carry out

this project seems to me that it is compatible that he could

be running code-breaking projects, or code stealing projects,

l'as well as this other activity.

2

Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the second

one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been

discussing. It was not to be put on the record although to be

5

done. That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,

• 6-

but to say that the code stealing was only a cover I think is

7

probably an unwarranted conclusion.

8

Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding

9

of 57,500 to $10,000?

10

Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of

an operation.

11

12

Senator Hart of Colorado. Precisely. I think it is too

Iittle.

13

14

Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is

15

largely a staff operation. In other words, you use your own

16

staff officers. You may hire an agent or something, but I don'

17

think you can draw nuch conclusion from the actual number on

18

the figure, one way of the other.

19

This might not have been the only such project. You know,

an

20

assassination project would cost you more money than that,

too.

...

Senator lart of Colorado. Absolutely.

amcunt of money involved. I think you get into a situation

where additional money would be put into cither of those kinds

found the instrumentality, the individual to do that, and that

required $100, 000, all he had to do was come back in and say?

Mr. Colby. He could get it.

Mr. Schwarz. I think we should have the record reflect

two things. The two gentlemen talking are not eyewitnesses

what we have been talking about.

Second, and related to that, for us to pursue this matter,

ve must have, and must have right away, the better evidence

which is in the possession of the CIA, which is at least the

Inspector Gencral

report of 1967; and more importantly than that

the interview notes reflecting whatever interviers you had

within the Central Intelligence Agency as to whether or

nor

the assassination attempts should continue and, second, whether

there was any discussions with persons outside of the Central

Intelligence igency as to whether of not the plot should continue

and the period of time would be the

initial authorization, which

was March 1960, after the Bay of Pigs, during the missile

crisis. And, parenthetically there, will you state whether it

was possible Castro might have been assassinated pursuant to

an ongoing plan during a period of time when the United States

and Russia were close to a nuclear confrontation. The next.

case is John F.Kennedy's assassination.

Finally, at the tire of the break-off in June of 1965,.

which I believe was Mr. Breckinridge's testinony, was anybody in

higher authority told that the operation had been broken off?

Because that will bear upon whether anybody in higher authorisy

had authorized or requested the operation.

This is related to the question I asked you about the use

8

Senator Mathias.

Before we leave this, I have one question.

9

Chairman Church.

Senator Mathias.

10

Senator Mathias. In light of the fact this poison pen was

11

actually proffered on the 22nd of November, 1963, is there a

12

scintilla of evidence - and as proffered to a Major in the

13

Cuban Army on active duty - is there a scintilla of evidence

14

that anyone in the Cuban Government had any knowledge or suspicio

15

prior to that date that this was a project that was planned?

16

Mr. Colby. There is certainly no evidence that anyone

17

had that information with respect to the Cubella operation.

18

19

Mr. Breckinridge. No.

Mr. Colby. The second phase of the Mafia operation had been

20

wrapped up by then, I think.

21

Mr. Breckinridge.

Yes.

22

Mr. Colby. The individual in Cuba involved in it had

23

take asylun, I think.

Mr. Breckinridge,

rio, the seguence is a little cifferont.

Mr. Breckinridge. Yos. There vere people who reporteilly

were int into Cuba, a team of three people -- and I said reporter

because we were working then through a Cuban exile leader.

They had the assignment of recruiting additional people ta

carry out such plans as might be developed. We never knew what

happened to those people . whether.they came back -- only that

they were sent in.

But if you are looking for a possibility of knowledge of

assassination plot, conceivably those three people could be

the source. of it, but not that the United States Government was

behind it.

Senator Mathias. But it is conceivable that Castro and

his government could have come upon some evidence that some

plot was afoot?

Mr. Colby. He certainly could have cross allegations, and

you really must assume that various of the other kind, even

independent activities, or the first phase of the Mafia progra

could have produced allegations of attempts against him with

the comment that CIA or the United States was behind it. The

possibility of that kind of allegation is just almost infinite.

Senator Mathias. Particularly considering the nature of

the instruments that were being deployed?

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir..

No. Breckinridgo. There is another consideration."-

Chairman Church. You really haven't told us on the recors

was.

We really haven't had the detail except as you gave it

to Senato: Mathias.

I wonder

if you could complete the record on this second

phase. Give us all the information that you know about that.

Mr. Breckinridge., Before I do, one additional consideratio

The Cuban exile community in Miami was engaged in a great

deal of plotting of its own

and a great deal of hyperbole, and

it is safe to assume that

Castro also had reports of assassinati,

schenes or threats from that group. So there is one more sourco

to that sort of thing.

when the question aross about getting in irtroductior to tha

that time, the Offica of Security, Colonel Edwards was asked

if he could establish a contact, and he went to Maneu, or

had somone go to Maheu, to see if Mahau could make such an

introduction.

Maneu knew a man by the name of Johnny Roselli, ho

lival in Los Angeles, who had the concassion for the icemakina

machines ou the strip in Las Vegas, and he arranged, Rosalli

arrarged an introduction so -- the CIA actually arranged,

to a man by the name of Sartos crafficanta.

Trafficante was the head of tha Cuban gambling inter=sts

he rcopered them hopint to attract tourists. And Trafficante

travelled to and fron Cuba.

Mr. •Breckinridge. On one previous occasion Botuliaun

had-beer considared for use or cigars that someone had hoped

to get to castro, and eventually that never got off the ground.

This was a scheme that was never approved and nevar vent romard

I knoir of that one instance ir which it was considered.

Botulinum was made into pills and these pills vere taker

again to Cuba. Castro stopped going to the restaurant thare

this man was.

The Bay of pigs occurred and the operation

was callud off.

When Harvey took over and then Inactivated the second phas=

in April of 1962, they went back to Varona, and one of th=

strange things is that Varona started off with the repatition

of the original restarant approach, which I thin! caused

some question as to the gap busuen what we are told and

was was happening.

that he had sons thrss men into Cuba whose job was to recruis

additionäl people for such plan as may asvalos. lie lat=r

planned to sand in three nor= people. He don't believe they

ever went.

The missile crisis intarvened. There were a number

of delays and we don't think they ever did go in.

The first three men, if in fact they did go in -- wa

don't krow who they were, ive don't know what they did, we

have been captured by Castro?

Mr. Breckirridge. It is possible.

Tile question that Senator Krgan ashed earlier, whui thay

could have kroi - these man we don't baliave could have known

the actual backors of the oparation, becaus. Varora was dealing

with a mamber of the syndicate with whon he had previous

connections.

The people who dealt with Varona felt that Pos-lli

was discreet and careful.

But those man could have been captured. They could have

supplied the interpretation that they might rot have known.

essentially that is the first and secord piasa.

Mr. Schwarz. In the discussion we had on the use of

criminal elements, we have dealt with the Castro operation.

In the middle of the book sipplied to us by Mr. Breckinridge

10

earlier this week, there is a discussion about the Lumumina

operation, and the Agent l. J. Win.

11

12

Now, is it a fact that Q. J. Win was the agent, or asset,

however you would refer to hin, who apparently vas considered

13

for the effort to assassinate Lumumba, which never took place;

14

is that right?

the iss the predecessor of the CIA in some sense?

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.

Mr. Schwarz.

Is it correct that "Lucky" Luciano was used

to help the OSS in connection with operations in Italy during

the Second World War?

Mr. Colby. I don't know, but I have heard that story

as well. It is an extensive story but I don't know the facts.

• Mr. Schwarz. For the record, Mr. Luciano was a Mafia

figure who lad been deported from the United States, or was in

jail in the United States?

•

Mr. Colby. Was in jail, I guess, and was later deported

after the War.

Mr. Schwarz.

Now, in connection with the instructions which

hyou issued in 1973 concerning activities outside of the Charter

of the CIA, you received, as we went through the other day, a

report from the Inspector General leading up to that in lay of

Mr. Colby. That is right.

Mr. Schwarz. And was part of the report that the CIA

had itself conducted for local police departments in lashington,

Arlington, Fairfas: and Alexandria, during the perica 1968 and

1969, a series of classes in items which included basics in

surveillance, photography, basic audio and countersabotage; and

addition, this is what I particularly call your attention to,

12

13

Mr. Colby. It was included in that, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. What was the purpose of conducting such a

course?

Mr. Colby: lie had a relationship with various police

departments around the country. They from time to time would

like to learn our knowledge of certain subjects that are quite

police, is it not?

_ Mr. Colby. Presumably, ves.

Chairman Church.

Why is CIA conducting courses teaching

local police illegal activity, ter to conduct illogal ofciations?

5

MI. Colby. I think at that time, it. Chairman, that was

at the request of the police department of that area, that they

7

were interested in this thing, and there is a defensive element

8

of it. In order to know how to protect against sorething, it

9

is well to know how it is actually conducted.

10

Chairman Church. Do you construe this activity to be

11 within the law, the basic statute which restricts your domestic

12 activities?

13

Mr. Colby. I don't think it is a violation of the law,

14

Mr. Chairman.

15

I did give some directive on that in 1973, that we not

16

engage in this anynore, in compliance with the spirit of the

17

amendment to the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration

18

Act, shich says that CIA will not provide support to the LEA

19

in its assistance to local police departments. And as far as

20

21

I was concerned, that is a policy that they don't want CIA in

touch with local police departments.

22

The fact of sharing our knowledge of techniques with a

23

24

25

local police department does not in my mind get us into actually

conducting domestic police activity. There is a difference

there.

Chairman Church. Xes. But apart from the technical

2

question of your jurisdiction, when you engage in teaching local

police departments how to conduct break-ins, surreptitious

4

5

break-ins, you are teaching then how to break the law.

Mr. Colby. You are teaching them how the law is broken.

. 6

Chairman Church. That is right.

7

8

Mr. Colby. Which can be useful to them in their knowledge

of how the law is broken, the techniques that are feasible.

9

Chairman Church. Or can be useful to them in knowing how

10

to break the law?

11

Mr. Colby. It could. It is an item of information that

12 they can use in any way they wish, either properly or improperly.

13

• Mr. Schwarz. Are you aware of any situations where govern

14 | mental officials, either state, local or Federal, have in fact

151

engaged in break-ins within the United States?

16

Mr. Colby. I know of certain situations related to foreign:

17

intelligence operations where access to appropriate targets has

18 been obtained either through subterfuge of pretending to be a

19

workman or something of that nature, and I think in that history!

20

there are some cases of actual break-ins.

Now, I assure you, Mr. Chairman, we have been conducting

21

22

break-ins abroad. There is no question about that. That is,

23

we train our people to be able to do that.

24

Chairman Church. That is not the question I am raising

25

with you.

other words, these courses, it is my inpression, were.

generalized discussions of tochniques. They vere not particula

handholding on conducting a specific operation.

I think I am accurate in that statement.

Mr. Smothers. Mr. Colby, just a couple of quick questions.

First, with regard to the fixes, memoranda or diaries you

might have of former directors, are those still on Agenci

premises?

Do you have those matters still there that were

left by former Directors?

ME. COlby. Certain ones

we do. I don't know of any that

we

don't have.

As far as I am concerned, they are Agency property, and wieh

leave I am going to walk out without any paper.

Mr. Smothers. With respect then to the inguiries you have

made with regard to information in the files on assassinations,

have these inquiries extended to an examination of these files

of former- Directors?

Mr. Breckinridge. In one or two instances on specific

points we have made inquiries. We have not gone through the

files in general for that purpose.

MI. Colby. We have

gone through that collection I know of

Mr. Helms' files.

I don't know of any specific set of files

called ir. McCone's files.

There is an exccutive registry where my correspondence is

- Mr. Smothors. What I an searching for is the situation

where the generic classification of materials night soncho:

complete enough for us to gat particular inuwledge.

and I was wondering prior to our next meeting if a search

oriented with respect to

the issue of knowledge might be a

fruitful exercise?

---

Mr. Colby, Knowledge by previous directors of specifics

on this topic?

Mr. Smothers. Yes.

Mr. Colby. I think it is easy for Mr. Helms. I think

we have gone through his files. I don't know of any seiarate

set of files on Mr. Dulles or Mr. MCCone. He will look.

, Senator Hondale. There is a reference. to john Mclone's.

files in one of the menos that I looked at this norning.

MI. Colby. I will check that, Senator.

Chairman Church. That is a good point, and I am glad you

have raised it.

I think we will conclude the hearing at this point with

the understanding, Mr. Colby, we will be back in touch with you.

Mr. Colby. Surely.

Many Enes, I think, Mr. Chairman

Chairman Church. Yes.

senator Mondale. If they could get the Lansdale memo.

Mr. Colby. I will do that tiis afternoon.

I would like to add two things that have come to my attentio:

on the subject of assassinations, both of which are allegations,

both of which have been knocked down.

There was an allegation, some man has alleged that he was

working or conducting an assassination in Colombia, and ve have

looked into the specifics of it, and there is absolutely nothing

to it. I thought I would mention it. I have the facts here

and will include them at sone time.

There is another allegation that one of our officers

had some knowledge of an attempt against Chou In-lai, and he hasi

written me a note that points out that it is impossible for that:

to have happened because he wasn't in the place at the tire.

Chairman Church. Since they are allegations into which

you bave inquired, I think you should make the papers available.

Mr. Colby. I will nake sure the stair gets those. ~

Chairnan Church. Thank you very much.

Mr. Knoche. Could I point out, I think we have the ansver

to the photographs.

23

There were seven of these photographs taken at different

24

angles at the same time, but absolutely different time intorvals;

25

during the tine that the police had these men in custoly.

Mr. Knoche. I am not sure. I am not cortain for that

particular board that you were looking at.

With the blowup, they took this one of the seven photographs

which gives the best opportunity to look at the face.

Mx. Colby..

So they were separate photographs.

Chairman Church. Yes.

Mr. Knoche. I will be glad to leave that with you if you

would like to have it for your file.

(Whereupon, at 12:30 o'clock pim., the Committee

recessed subject to the

call of the Chair.)
