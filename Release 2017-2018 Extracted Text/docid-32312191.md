On December 2, 1963, a confidential source

abroad brought to the attention of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation a news article which appeared in the

"Miami Herald," Miami, Florida, on September 22, 1963,

claiming that the British Honduras border was being

used for the infiltration of Communist revolutionaries

into Latin America.

According to this source,

article was later the basis for a report in the

"Belize Billboard," which echoed the view of the opposttion

party in British Honduras (at that time accusing the

government of having pro-Communist sympathies) and which

was allegedly designed to embarrass the government.

Also, according to the source, the Government

of British Honduras subsequently issued a statement to

the effect that the security authorities of that govern»

ment were not aware of any evidence to confirm that the

country was being used by Communist agents, and requested

the "Miami

Herald" to furnish confirmation of the allega-

tions contained in the article appearing on September 22,

1963.

The "Miami Herald" reporter who had written the

article replied that his story was based on information

received from the Cuban Student Directorate, which is

identical with the captioned organization, located

Miami, Florida. (E)
