intthe "Minutemen" file.

On 9/3/63, Mr. DONALD G. KEMP, 10047 Lake Highlands

Place, Dallas 18, Texas,

(protect), advised SA JAMES P. HOSTY, JR.,

on a highly confidential basis that EDWARD C. SCHWILLE 18 a

leading member of a secret organization similar to the

"Minutemen"

Mr. KEMP advised that SCHWIll keeps large

amounts of ammunition and weapons secretly stored in his

house and that he, KEMP, has seen this ammunition and weapons

which included a sub-machine gun. KEMP advised that ASHLAND

FREDERIC BURCHWELL, (Bufile 152-40, entitled *ASHLAND FREDERIC

BURCEWEL, Switchblade Knife Act,"OO; DL, Dallas file 152-2) who

was arrested by the Dallas Police bepartment with

a large

amount of ammunition in his car allegedly destined for oxford,

Mississippi,

to assist former Major General EDWIN A. WALKER,

had obtained this ammunition from the residence of SCHWILLE:

BURCHWELL also had in his car papers indicative of some type

organizational structure or operation, but he sald these

belonged to a friend whom he did not care to identity, and

he disclaimed knowledge of their significauce..

KEMP advised

that SCHWILLE is the leader of this group that BURCHWEll had

the membership cards for.

appear to be extremely fearful thai

I that the United

States is

in imminent danger of a communist take-over either directly

or through surrender of the United States surrendering its

armed forces to the United Nations.

These fears appear

to be based upon information being put out by the American

Eagle Publishing Company of

Dallas, Texas,

owned by former

General EDWIN A. WALKER and based upon the State Department

document

"Freedom from War." All of these individuals insist

that they have no intention of overthrowing the United States

Government at any time, however, admit that if this organization

came under the control of an unreliable person it could become

& possible danger to the United States. It was noted that in

recent interviews with these individuals they appeared to be

somewhat redieved by the strong action taken by the present

administration in Cuba and are no longer as firmly convinced

that the present administration is preparing to betray this

country.

It was admitted byXBOTELLO and BURCHWElL that this

organization at one time had considered affiliation with the

"Minutemen"; however, they are no longer connected with this

organization but are acting independently in the Dallas area

since they were not satisfied with the leadership of ROBERT

DE PUGH.

The Dallas file in the case entitled "UNNAMED

ORGANIZATION OF DALLAS, TEXAS, PATRIOTS; INFO CONCERNING

(INTERNAL SECURITY); 00: DL; Bufile 100-439412, Dallas file

105-1475, 1s being

reopened for a determination of the present

status of this group and a reintervier of DONALD G. KEMP

and others as warranted and appropriate. Any information

pertinent to instant investigation which is obtained will

be reported in the instant case, as well as in the Unnamed

Organization file.

On 11/16/61, WILLIAM JAMES LOWERY, JR.j a member

or the communist Party from 1943 to 1963, and who furnished

information to the FBI during this period *and DI-16-S, U

advised SA W. HARLAN BROWN that they had no information

concerning the "Minutemen" organization and that this

organization was unknown to them.

the organization was operating in Dallas.

On 8/23/62, former DI-18-S was being interviewed

Former DL-18-S advised that he was able to determine

organization and to recruit members of the NIC to his group.

He indicated that the leadership of the NIC did not want to

they are mostly anti-Semitic. These individuals insist,

however, that they will not violate the constitution of the

States from communist enemies from within and outside the

United States:

with regard to some of the same groups involved in the

"Unnamed Organizations of Dallas, Texas, Patriots" and

will be considered with respect to bringing that investigation

up to date as mentioned hereinbefore.
