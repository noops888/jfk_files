II.: Summary of Contact:

On this date, Gary Cornwell and Kenneth Klein interviewed

the above in

the Senate. Intelligence Committee room.

Also

present were E.F. Yeates, Chief, Leg. Office, NSA, Michael Smith.

OFf. of Gen. Counsel, NSA and It. Col. Jeffrey Grabam, U.S.A.F.

Sgt. Stevenson was asked to comment on the letter written

to him by David ?. Christensen. Sgt. Stevenson stated Ehat

although he had known Christensen a number of years ago,

he did not know anything about the particular incident

described in the letter. He recognized most of the names

and places in the letter and stated they were accurate. -

(in that those people did serve with him and Christensen)

but he knew nothing about the intercept described in the

letter. He further stated that the link mentioned in the

letter --Portugal to lisbon=- was one that they were able

to pick up when he worked with Christensen.

III.

Stevenson stated that he could not completely rule out the

possibility. that such a message was intercepted but he

felt that if it was intercepted, it would be extremely

unlikely that it would not have been passed on.

Sgt. Stevenson also stated that he had not heard from

Christensen for many years since serving with him and

shortly before receiving the letter he received a phone

call from Christensen.

At that time Christensen told

him that he was sending him a letter but did not mention

anything about what the letter would say.

During the interview Gary Cornwell asked the representative. from

NSA whether an attempt had been made to check all messages.

that had been received during the period prior to the

assassination

to determine

whether the intercept might

have been sent through and eventually reached the

proper authorities.

The NSA representative stated that

although they checked their warehouses

to determine if

there was such a message that was received but was not

sent to NSA to distribute, that he was not sure whether

they had considered the possibility that the message had

gone through to the proper

authorities.

Also during the interview, Gary Cornwell suggested that

Sgt. Stevenson place a phone call to Christensen and ask

him the name of the person that the letter refers to as

being involved in the assassination.

Sat. Stevenson

expressed reluctance to such involvement and the

lawyer representing him stated that such a phone call

could only be arranged

through the

Department of

Defense.
