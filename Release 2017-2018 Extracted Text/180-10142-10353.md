of the CIA working as an operations officer in the Deputy Directorate of

Operations. He joined the CIA in 1957 and, with the exception of one year

of duty with the Air Force, has continued until the present time in his

employment with the Central Intelligence Agency.

Prior to the beginning of the interview Mr. Piccolo was asked to read

the CIA's omnibus release letter of 23 March 1978. After his examination

of the letter, Mr. Piccolo indicated that he fully understood the letter's "

meaning. Mr. Berk then explained to Mr. Piccolo the mandate and purposes

of the Select Committee.

Mr. Piccolo stated that at the time of President Kennedy's assassination

he was a support assistance analyst in the DDO. His responsibilities

included maintenance of records, running of traces, and Spanish language

analysis for purposes of operational support. Subsequent to this position

Mr. Piccolo undertook training during the spring of 1964 to become an

operations officer. Mr. Piccolo further stated that his professional

areas of interest were mainly concerned with Latin America. He also in-

dicated that he served in the CIA's Mexico City Station from

August 1965 to January 1968.

It was further

ascertained that Mr. Piccolo was involved in some Agency operations

directed against Cuba during the time periods 1962 to January 1968,

January 1969 to January 1970, and a three month period during 1975.

Mr. Piccolo was asked if he was familiar with the cryptonym AMMUG/1.

Cuban counterpart for external security and counter-intelligence operations.

Mr. Piccolo stated that he did not participate in the initial handling

and debriefing of A/1 but became involved in this case during the summer of

1964 when he first met A/1. At that time, Mr. Piccolo was assigned to

"handhold" A/l; i.e., to ensure that A/l was properly accomodated and

escorted and to provide companionship for A/1.

Mr. Piccolo recalled that A/1 had been debriefed In canada after his

defection.

He stated that the objectives of the initial debriefings would

have been to gain biographic data on persons associated with the Cuban

Intelligence Service and information on persons who might collaborate

with the CIA. He indicated that he ceased contact with A/1 prior to 1966

and the last information he had was that A/1 was residing infMiami, J

Florida and was adjusting well to life in this country.

As for the filing of the debriefing reports, Mr. Piccolo said the

filing procedure would habe been dictated by the manner in which the case

was handled; i.e., by subject or cryptonym or personality. He did state

that debriefing reports would habe initially been held in the office

handling the case. These repors would hake been "held tight" to allow

time for operations to be developed while security risks he at a minimum.

However

Mon Mr. Piccolo said he did know where such debriefing reports would now

be located.

Mr. Piccolo later became responsible for debriefing A/1. Mr. Piccolo

was not able to recall the exact time period during which he debriefed

which continued tor

A/1 Abe approximately a four to six month period. Mr. Piccolo stated that

[jarold Swenson, Barney Hidalgo and Dan Flores also debriefed A/1.

Mr. Piccolo was queried as to the responsibilities of WHL

CIA component responsible for the A/1 case. He indicated that this component

whose chief war arold Swenson horked against the Outs. He further indi

cated that WH/_

to carry out its function, probably ran

operations.

Mr. Piccolo was next queried whether he recalled a CIA component

referred to as the "domestic exploitation section". Mr. Piccolo stated

that this terminology was not familiar to him but that domestic exploitation

would most likely have been located in a positive intelligence section of

the Agency such as the Domestic Contacts Division. He did state, however, â€¢

that recruitment or contact of persons in this country for utilization in

foreign operations would have been the responsibility of every operations

officer. He doubted that the Western Hemisphere Division would have run

such an office but that operational recruitment would hate been handled

as part of a specific project or program.

Mr. Piccolo was queried whether A/1 providied any information to the

CIA on Lee Harvey Oswald and his possible contacts with the DGI. He

responded that he recalls no A/l debriefing reports providing such infor-

mation nor did A/l provide such information to him. Mr. Piccolo further

declared thar assrs. Swenson, Hidalgo, and Flores never indicated to him

that A/l had ever provided any information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

Mr. Piccolo was next queried as to the meaning of the term "Special

Intelligence." He indicated that the term usually applies to the inter-

ception of communications, e.g., signal intelligence which would include

radio waves and radar but would not have included electronic surveillance.

Mr. Piccolo further stated that special intelligence would hape been

handled by

special unit segregated from other agency

Harvey Oswald resulting from the photographic surveillance operations con-

conducted by the CIA Mexico City Station. He responded in the affimative

stating that he had seen two photographs unat the person who showed belt yu,

pr. Piccol-

to him said were taken in Mexico City. Me said that the person, whose

identity he was unable to recall, had shown him the pictures saying:

(paraphrase) "These

are the pictures of Oswald that we got in Mexico."

He stated that he was led to understand that these two pictures had been

taken of Lee Harvey Oswald either entering or leaving the Cuban Embassy/

Consulate in Mexico City. The first picture was a 3/4 full shot of

Oswald exposing his left profile as Oswald looked downward. The second

photograph which Mr. Piccolo recollected seeing was a back of the head

view of Oswald. At this point in the interview Mr. Piccolo was shown

CE 237, the famous photograph of the Mexico Mystery Man. All printed

identification bordering the photograph was covered prior to Mr. Piccolo's

examination. Mr. Piccolo was then asked who the man in CE 237 was. ME.

Piccolo responded that he did not know but that the person was not. Oswald.

Mr. Piccolo was asked if this was one of the photographs he had seen and

he responded in the negative. Mr. Piccolo was next shown a full frontal

photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald. This photograph also had all printed

material bordering its surface covered. When asked who the person in

the photograph was, after a moment's pause, Mr. Piccolo correctly identified

the photograph as orRof Lee Harvey Oswald. Mr. Piccolo stated that he

could not recall where or when he had seen the surveillance photographs

Of Lee Harvey Oswald but was certain of their presentation to him as such.

Me. Piccolo was questioned about ine hulerse concthe finding of

the surveillance photographs of Oswald. He stated that he did not have

first hand knowledge of that but that it was the type of thing, a coup,

that would have traveled through the Agency "grapevine". Mr. Piccolo

stated that he had heard stories about a surveillance photograph of Oswald

being found both in Mexico City and at CIA Headquarters in Langley.

He

said that Ann Goodpasture may have been the person who found a photograph

of Oswald in Mexico City. He stated that he has heard several times that

discussion with a man with whom he shares an office.

He stated that

this man,

had worked on the Oswald case during an

"in house" investigation a couple of years ago. He said that they were

talking about the case because of the HSCA's release of several photographs

to the press with a request that anyone able to identify those photos

contact the Committee. Mi. Piccolo stated that during the course of

this discussion

ptatod that charlotte Bust "the gal at

the Mexico desk", had found the surveillance photographs of Oswald. Mr.

Piccolo stated that he assumed that
