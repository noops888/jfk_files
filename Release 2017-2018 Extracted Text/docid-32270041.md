These measurements were made on Kodak Verichrome Pan film type 620

developed in D-19 at 68° I for 3 minutes with continuous agitation.

This film

was exposed on a multicollimator camera calibrator using a white light source

rated

at approximately 3500K.

The radial distortion is measured for each of 4 radii of the focal plane

separated by 90° in azimuth.

Dc is the average distortion for a given field angle.

Values of distortion De are based on the equivalent focal length referred to the

field angle co-tangent for 7.5

• The radial distortion is given in micrometres

and indicates the radial displacement of the image from its distortion free

position. A positive value indicates a displacement away from the center of the

field. These measurements are considered accurate within

10 um. It is clear

from these variations in the values reported among the four radii from the average

that a substantial amount of asymmetric distortion is present in this lens.

These measurements were made from a shadow image formed in the focal plane.

The method of measuring these distances is considered accurate within 0.01 mm.

The camera was aligned for calibration by autocollimating on the mounting

surface where the front of the test camera-lens was placed for the film

exposures. It is evident however that this is an indirect procedure, but the

only method possible for a camera of this type.

This alignment process made

the front of the lens ring normal to the axis of the collimator bean emergent

from the 0° collimator.
