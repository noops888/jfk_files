EAST GERMAN REACTION TO RELAXATION OF BERLIN TRAVEL

The East German people, while elated over the holi-

day travel arrangements in Berlin, are publicly

voicing hope

that they may be permitted to visit

their relatives in West Berlin and West Germany.

NORTH KOREA IMPROVES AIR DEFENSE CAPABILITY

Pyongyang has more widely dispersed its supersonic

MIG-21s, has acquired relatively sophisticated new

radar, and has equipped its IL-28s with an improved

bombing and navigational system.

NORTH VIETNAM'S MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT

This military force, primarily a ground army with

no tactical air and

little naval capability, is

most formidable in Southeast Asia.

Its most notable achievement is its highly special-

ized capability to support and maintain insurgency

operations in adjacent countries.

BREAKUP OF THE FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALAND

The ten-year-old federation is being dissolved on

has persistently opposed it as

Its dissolution will end London's

ENTHUSIASM FOR SOUTH VIETNAM REGIME FLAGGING

Communist guerrilla activ-

ity increased only slightly in

connection with the third anni-

versary, on 20 December, of the

Viet Cong's Liberation Front,

despite advance Communist propa-

ganda exhortation for a major

military effort.

The Viet Cong

continued to direct attacks and

harassing activities primarily

at strategic hamlets.

South Vietnam's new govern-

is showing extreme sensi-

tivity to discussion of a

"neu-

tralist solution" to its in-

surgency problem.

The Communists'

Liberation Front has repeatedly

proposed such a settlement, and

the idea is gaining new

advocates

as

a result of Cambodia's call

for an

international conference.

Saigon's military rulers last

week closed down a newspaper

which was expressing interest in

neutralism.

However, editorials

though attacking neutralism, have

kept the debate in the public eye.

On 20 December, Saigon students--

possibly encouraged by the re-

gime--demonstrated against neu-

tralism.

On the military front, the

government is beginning to

take

some

steps to overcome the leth-

argy that has affected its coun

terinsurgency effort since the

exiles apparently are not rep-

resented,

and there is a dearth

of direct provincial represen-

tation. Many appointees, how-

ever, are prominent political,

professional and lay religious

leaders who could provide effec-

tive guidance to the regime if

they are given a chance.

over the new government are wide-

Leading generals nevertheless

seem to have few effective steps

to US officials that they were hav-

of their efforts was unhelpful.

They

also agreed, in principle, that

ment should be transferred from

Vientiane to the royal capital

at Luang Prabang, which would be

neutralized and placed under tri-

partite control. Both factions

reiterated their support for

the formation of a mixed police

force in a neutralized Vientiane.

General Phoumi's right-

wing faction, which was not

represented at the meeting,

remains skeptical of Pathet

Lao intentions.

Phoumi apparently

believes that an agreement for

He has indicated, however, that.

the neutralization of Vientiane

FRENCH CABINET MINISTER TO VISIT CAMBODIA

Armed Forces Minister

Pierre Messmer's visit to Cam-

bodia from 4-7 January is de-

signed primarily to strengthen

French influence there in the

wake of Prince Sihanouk's call

•for an end to the US aid pro-

Messmer's high-level

entourage, which includes the

chiefs of

the Foreign Ministry's

Indochina and Cultural and Tech-

nical divisions, will probably

recommend some increases in aid,

but De Gaulle apparently has

no intention of taking on any

large new

commitments.

French-grant aid to Cam-

bodia since 1956 has amounted

to only $15 million.

Current

assistance is threefold:

military training mission of at

least 250 men; cultural aid in

the form of a university mission

319 teachers in Cambodian

schools; and the maintenance of

about 40 experts in the fields

of health and public works. In

addition, a number of French

hired by the Cambodian

Government hold positions of

considerable influence in the

Ministry of Finance,

the Treas-

ury, and the premier's office,

and

are among Prince Sihanouk's

advisers.

Paris has indicated it has

no intention of

equaling

• the

US aid program.

Any increase

in military aid probably would

be limited to reconditioned and

obsolete equipment, such as

trucks and light armored vehicles.

Increased cultural and technical

assistance probably would include

further help for the French uni-

versity mission, more teachers,

and 30 or 40 additional technical

experts, especially agricultural-

ists.

The extension of French aid

will be complicated by Cambodia's

claims for compensation for

losses incurred as a result of

the 1958 devaluation of the

French franc.

Since 1958 France

has asserted that a large-scale

aid program would be impossi-

ble until there is agreement on

an exchange rate, but a compro-

mise may now be in sight.

Sihanouk has sought French

help in maintaining Cambodia's

policy of neutrality, and in

recent talks with the US and the

UK, France has supported

his

call for an international con-

ference on Cambodian neutral-

ity, despite US objections.

Indeed, De Gaulle has consist-

ently sought to meet Sihanouk

more than half way, and Paris

may now encourage Sihanouk

to press this issue.

ARABS PLAN NO OVERT ACTION AGAINST ISRAELI PROJECT

The Arab states evidently

do not plan any overt military

action against Israel when in

late January

or early February

the Israelis begin pumping tests

for their Jordan River diversion

project, but sabotage of the

s facilities may be at-

tempted.

The Arab military chiefs

who met in Cairo

in mid-December

apparently decided

that direct

military attacks are not feasi-

ble.

The chiefs reportedly

agreed, however,

that the states

bordering on Israel should

mount independent

and uncoor-

dinated clandestine operations.

The Arab League Defense

Council, which meets in January,

probably will approve this rec-

ommendation, but its implementa-

tion is another matter.

tian, Jordanian, and Lebanese

officials have

indicated pri-

vately that their governments

have no intention of

aggressive action of any kind

against the Israeli project.

Nasir, however, told the

Canadian ambassador

in early

December that he was worried

that Syria might act unilater-

ally and present the other Arab

states with a dilemma. Damascus

will be under strong pressure

to fulfill its threats against

the Israeli scheme, particularly

the close proximity

of the Syrian border to Israel's

pumping station on Lake Tiberias.

Nasir's wariness about be-

coming involved in a war with

Israel over Jordan waters was

also evident in a speech he

made on 23 December.

He empha-

sized that the problem is polit-

ical rather than military in

nature and that the chiefs of

staff cannot solve it.

Arab presidents and kings to

Israel

considers there

is

an outside possibility that

Syria might bomb or shell the

pumping facility's transformer

station.

However, the Israelis

believe the primary threat stems

from former Palestinians now

living in Syria, Jordan or

Lebanon, who might make a dra-

matic effort to sabotage the

project even though they prob-

ably could not cause serious

damage.

CYPRUS DISPUTE FLARES AGAIN

Fighting between the Greek

and Turkish Cypriot communities,

which began on 21 December and

was continuing on 26 December

despite efforts to obtain a cease-

fire, is the culmination of a

steady growth of tension on the

island during the past few weeks.

The new tension followed Presi-

dent Makarios' presentation to

Turkish Cypriot leaders of propos-

als for changing the Cyprus con-

stitution.

The proposals, which

essentially involved removing the

guarantees to the Turkish minor-

ity that had been written into

the Cyprus settlement of 1959,

vere rejected by the Turkish Gov-

ernment even before the Turkish

Cypriots had

made their views

known.

Most of the initial fight-

ing appears to have been between

Greek Cypriot police and the Turk-

ish underground, and to have taken

place in the Turkish areas of Nic-

osia..

The situation there de-

teriorated progressively during

the week, as the police lost con-

trol to extremist groups of ir-

regulars from both communities.

A cease-fire,

to be supervised

by the British, had not been ef-

fective as of

the morning of 26

December.

Fighting had also con-

tinued at the port city of Lar-

naca; the rest of

the island was

quiet but tense.

In the face of these de-

velopments, the Turkish Govern-

ment threatened to exercise its

right under the 1959 agreement

to intervene on Cyprus.

Three

Turkish jet fighters flew over

Nicosia on 25 December, and

Turkish naval units appeared off

the island.

Part of the 650-man

Turkish garrison on Cyprus left

its barracks to move into one

of the Turkish quarters of the

capital.

Part of the 950-man

Greek contingent then moved to

protect Greek areas.

The situa-

tion evidently prodded Athens

and London into a more active

role, and Greek, Turkish and

British forces on Cyprus have

been placed under a unified Brit-

ish-led command.

Britain has an-

nounced it is sending 150 ad-

ditional troops.

The violence may make, lead-

ers of both sides more cautious

in pressing political demands.

Soon after the outbreak, Makarios

told the us ambassador he would

go more slowly in pushing his con-

stitutional revisions.

Both eth-

nic groups, however, will be fur-

ther embittered--particularly

the Turkish community, which

is believed to have suffered

much the heavier casualties.

The dispute centered on

Saud's attempt to resume per-

which he relinquished to Faysal

a year ago when his health

broke.

The immediate issues

were variously reported to have

been the new budget, which cuts

funds allotted to the royal

family, and Faysal's refusal

to give cabinet posts to two

of Saud's sons.

In blocking Saud's chal-

lenge, Faysal apparently was

supported by most of the im-

portant members of the royal

ramily.

Throughout the crisis

the Saudi regular army remained

under the orders of the minis-

ter of defense, Prince Sultan,

a Faysal adherent.

Some ob-

King's action has actually served

to strengthen Faysal's position.

THE TARIFF DISPARITIES ISSUE.E

The tariff disparities issue which has plagued preparations for the Kennedy Round for many

months originates in the fact that there are substantial differences between the EEC and US:

tariffs on individual items, even though over-all tariff levels are roughly the same. Because

the EEC common external tariff was arrived at by averaging the tariffs of the member states,

the EEC tariff schedule is characterized by the absence of "peaks and lows", in the US schedule,

on the other hand, the rates vary much more, and some individual fariffs remain very high in

comparison with those of the EEC. Accordingly,

the EEC and the French in particular haye

long insisted that a 50-percent cut in tariffs by both the US and the LEC would leave the US

with substantial protection on certain items and deprive the EEC of bargaining power to effect

their future reduction:

he disparities issue was believed to have been settled at the GATT ministerial meeting

last May with a formula which provided that tariffs on industrial items would in general be:

reduced equally and across the board, except that special rules" would apply. "where sig-

nificant adverse effects on trade would result from disparities in tariff levels * In fact how-

ever, this formula merely shifted the argument to the problem of determining what disparifies

are "significant" or. "meaningfül in trade terms." Because the "special, rules" would mean in

most cases d smaller tariff reduction by the EEC than by the US, the EEC has attempted to

maximize the area to which these rules would apply while the US has sought to minimize thei

application.

After lengthy negotiation, a GATT subcommittee reached, a considerable measure of

agreement last month on a formula which would identify a "significant" tariff disparity in

the

first instance as one in which the high rate is at least 30 percent of value and at least

10 percent above the lower rate. Because this formula woüld identify some 850 US items as

eligible for "special treatment," the subcommittee proposed seven additional qualitative cris

teria which would reduce considerably the number of eligible items The three to which the

US attaches special importance would (1) require that there be substantial imports of the item

concerned from the high tariff country into the low, (2) exclude items where there are sub

stantiol imports into the high tariff country; and (3) exclude items on which the low fariff

• country maintains quotas.

The formula approved by the EEC on 23 December would substitute for the 30/10 criterion

02/1 formula. A disparity would be identified as one in which the high tariff is twice as

THE COMMON MARKET CRISIS

The Common Market appears to

have averted disaster for the sec-

ond time in less than a year. The

eleventh-hour agreements reached

on agricultural policy on 23 De-

cember are apparently sufficient

to discourage De Gaulle from carry-

ing out his threat to break up the

community. Moreover, the Germans

and Dutch succeeded in extracting

limited commitments from Paris on

EEC participation in the Kennedy

Round of tariff negotiations.

agreements do not cover all the out-

standing issues, however, and the

manner in

which

they were reached

will leave a residue of bitterness.

Nor is it certain that major US

interests have fared well.

The main agricultural elements

in the "package"

deal are the reg-

ulations concerning intracommunity

trade in beef, rice, and dairy prod-

ucts and the rules

governing the

community farm fund.

is to open the large West German

market to farm exports of France,

Italy, and the Netherlands--gen-

erally at a substantial advantage

over the exports of nonmembers. Al-

though approval of these and the

financial regulations is an im-

portant step forward, the key ques-

tion of grain price unification is

still unsettled.

Further considera-

tion of the formula proposed by Com-

missioner Mansholt has been delayed

until next year.

The agreement on a Kennedy

Round position is likewise an ad-

vance for the community, but from

the US view not necessarily favor-

the long-standing problem

of tariff "disparities," the EEO

adopted a formula which

exempt from the proposed 50-per-

cent linear reduction in tariffs

a far larger number of items

than

the US hoped for:

The EEC position

on farm products in the trade ne-

gotiations--although an improvement

over the initial Mansholt propos-

als--also leaves much to be desired

from the US view.

In general, the

EEC proposes that, if its levy sys-

tem operates in such a way as to

cause difficulties for the exports

of nonmembers, then the EEC Commis-

sion will be called on to propose

measures.

if it is technically impossible to

determine how much protection is

actually involved in the levy sys-

tem.

The general relief within

the community which greeted these

agreements reflects both the

depth of the crisis and some op-.

timism that the Common Market's

unity may have been restored. The

prominent role played by the

EEC's commission in achieving

the compromise has in particu-

lar encouraged those who hope to

strengthen the community's in-

stitutional structure.

In France the conviction

was evidently widespread, how-

ever, that both Bonn and The

Hague were quite prepared to see

the French "leave" the Comnon Mar-

ket, and in the event of its

breakup,

to seek alternative

ties with the Outer Seven. More-

over, while it may prove healthy

that

Bonn "stood up" to De Gaulle

in this instance, its motive was

strongly colored by a desire to pro-

tect its inefficient farmers. Nor

does it augur well for US-EEC re-

lations that the French blame the

Us for much of the opposition

they encountered.

DOMINICAN REGIME FACES NEW POLITICAL CHALLENGES

The killing of 15 guerrillas

by Dominican Army troops on 21

December apparently removes the

last pocket of insurgents op-

posing the government.

However,

the incident could provoke dan-

gerous political repercussions.

Santos, head

of the governing military-in-

stalled triumvirate, resigned

protest over what he regarded as

the brutal and unnecessary kill-

ing of the insurgents, includ-

ing

the president of the pro-

Castro 14th of June Political

Group.

The army commander of

the area in which the incident

took place insists the deaths

were the unavoidable result of

a fire fight.

If stories of

armed forces "brutality" be-

come widespread, however, they

could provoke dangerous hostility

toward the regime from rank-and-

file Dominicans, who recall

repressive measures of former

dictator Trujillo.

The resignation of De Los

Santos precipitated frantic ma-

neuvering within the government

among civilian and military

elements. Only the prompt ap-

pointment of Foreign Minister

Donald Reid to the vacant post

in the triumvirate appears to

have helped avert a serious

political crisis for the moment.

The triumvirate has asked

the cabinet--which was chosen

from and is responsible to six

minority political parties--to

resign to permit the appoint-

ment of a more independent group.

This move has promnted strong

protests from four of the splinter

parties backing the regime, who

stand to lose patronage; the

outcome is unclear.

However, the National

Civic Union, the only sizable

party in the government, backs

the cabinet reorganization.

More important, the key leaders

of the armed forces are provid-

ing the triumvirate with their

support, which could prove cru-

cial in a political showdown.

BRAZIL

Further changes in the Bra-

zilian cabinet are expected fol-

lowing the resignation last week

of Finance Minister Carvalho

A moderate leftist,

Galvao, was appointed Pinto's

successor, but there remains a

possibility that Leonel Brizola--

who had been actively pushed for

the post by the extreme left--

may eventually receive some min-

istry.

There is widespread be-

lief in the army that War Min-

ister Jair Ribeiro will also be

replaced in the near

future. As

one responsible Brazilian com-

mentator has remarked, with Gou-

lart "every minister

is an in-

terim one."

Ney Galvao's appointment

actually reduces the

previously

slight prospect that Brazil's

critical financial problems would

be handled effectively.

Galvao's

qualifications in the economic

field are weak at best and his rec-

as head of the Bank of Brazil

foreign trade policies, a job

he performed without any par-

ticular distinction.

Goulart's, Galvao can be expected

to toe the adminstration line

faithfully. Moreover, Galvao's

appointment may be a temporary

expedient designed to allay

fears that Brizola would succeed

Pinto. Galvao is a personal

friend of Brizola and there is

speculation that Brizola will,

in fact, eventually move into

the Finance Ministry.

The new finance minister

inherits almost insurmountable

economic and financial problems.

Chief among these are a rampant

inflation that may see the cost

of living increase 80 percent

this year, and a staggering

foreign debt involving approxi-

mately $1 billion in payments

due over the next two years.

The severity of the eco-

nomic situation and Goulart's

apparent intention to assume

greater personal direction over

financial policies increase

the possibility of radical meas-

that might be detrimental

to foreign creditors and in-

vestors.

Goulart reportedly is

considering nationalization of

all public utilities and can-

cellation of mining concessions.

Measures such as these could

lead to further deterioration

of Brazil's economic position.
