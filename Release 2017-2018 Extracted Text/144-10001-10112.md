EMBASSY WASHINGTON REPORTS REACTION TO, KENNEDY AND CASTRO

[5-part message complete]

I am communicating to.you herewith Washington telegram

of 12 December 1963.

The Cuban affair has abruptly returned to the forefront with

the republication of articles written for L'Express by Mr: JEAN

DANIEL after his conversations with President KENNEDY and CASTRO,

first in the weekly The New Republic, and then in the New York

Times and the Washington Post. From the comments of the American

press, I might single out the following elements:

1. Although President KENNEDY did indeed mention Hungary

in his conversation with Mr. ADZHUBEI--Mr. PIERRE SALINGER has

just acknowledged it after haying denied it--it was only, according

to the White House spokesman, to show the importance of: Cuba to the

United States. On the othér hand, the President did not make any

allusion to the fact that the United States was a passive witness

to the Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956. In any; case, since

The Bay of Pigs, President KENNEDY never had any intention of invad-

ing Cuba. He categorically answered a question on this subject by

Mr. ADZHUBEI in the negative.

The administration puts no trust in CASTRO's

statements to the effect that the Soviets installed rockets in

Cuba to prevent an invasion of the island by the United States.

At most,, it is thought here that Mr. KHRUSHCHEV may have told

CASTRO that the installation of these rockets was indispensable to

his country's defense.

3. MI. KHRUSHCHEV's decision is still explained by his wish

to compensate quickly and cheaply for the Soviet Union's strategic.

inferiority. Moreover, as a study by the Rand Corporation recalls,

this is what CASTRO töld Mr. JULIEN of Le Monde when he admitted:

"It was not to ensure our, own defense that we accepted the rockets,

but to reinforce the socialist camp's position. This is the truth,

even if others provide different explanations."

4. However that may be, the publication of these interviews

puts President JOHNSON in a delicate, position. As Mr. CHALMERS

ROBERTS remarked in the Washington Post, Mr. KHRUSHCHEV' $

emissaries hint that perhaps an arrangement is possible between

the United States and CASTRO. The latter; in his interview with

MI. DANIEL, intimated that he might put an end to his terrorist

agitation campaign in Latin America if the United States lifted

its economic blockade of the island. Therefore, Mr. ROBERTS

acknowledges, this perhaps gives a margin to the United States

for maneuvering, but "only a short time after having acceded to

the presidency and only a year before the elections, Mr.. JOHNSON's

possibilities

for action in this field are very limited.
