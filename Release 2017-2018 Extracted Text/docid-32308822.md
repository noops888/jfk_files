LEADS (continued)

Will continue to follow and report the activity

and associations of the subject.

ADMINISTRATIVE

The investigative period reflects investigation

conducted

prior to date of referenced report which was not

available at time report was prepared. The deby in sub-

mission of a report was caused by SA PETER C. CLEMENTE'S

full time participation during April, 1966, in the DANIEL

JESS GOLDMAN Kidnap case, Miami file

7-686.

Consideration in the past has been given to sub-

ject's informant potential.

Interviews at that time disclosed

his determination never to

be an informant.

In the immediate

future SILESI will be ontacted and probes made to determine

if he is still unwilling to cooperate, with the FBI.

However,

it is felt he is a "die hard"

, "hard core"

La Cosa Nostra who will never

become an informant.

An extra copy of instant report is being furnished

New York for inclusion in 92-657 Sub 1, the CARLO GAMBINO

"family" file of La Cosa Nostra.
