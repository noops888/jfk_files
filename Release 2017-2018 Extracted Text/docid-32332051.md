On 8/31/59, RICHARD B. JAFFE, PSI under development,

who is a close associate of ROLANDO MASFERRER, a leading

anti-CASTRO exile residing in Miami, reported that NORMAN

ROTHMAN, manager of the Biltmore Terrace Hotel, Miami Beach,

disclosed that he was in the process of obtaining a U. S.

but indicated that he would take this trip soon for some

purpose which he also did not disclose.

It is to be noted that ROTHMAN has recently been

making overtures to MASFERRER and has offered to procure the

assassination of WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN in return for the

sum of $100, 000.00 which is expected to be put up by

Generalissimo RAFAEL TRUJILLO of the Dominican Republic.

It is to be noted that WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN is an

American soldier of fortune who fought against BATISTA

in Cuba during the recent Cuban revolution. Between

8/8 and 8/14/59, MORGAN was the leading figure in a

"double-cross" of anti-CASTRO Cubans and Dominicans who

had reportedly paid MORGAN a very large sum of money for

his cooperation in establishing an armed front against

CASTRO in Cuba. MORGAN is in Cuba.

Also ROTHMAN, according to PSI JAFFE, has

offered to put MASFERRER and JAFFE in touch with his

"organization" for the purpose of providing financial

assistance to MASFERRER in overthrowing the CASTRO

government in return for substantial business subsidies

and franchises should MASFERRER succeed. ROTHMAN indi

cated that his "organization" controls millions of dollars

and has established business firms. It appears that

ROTHMAN undoubtedly had

reference to the MANNARINO gang.

PSI JAFFE has been instructed to attempt to

obtain all additional information possible concerning the

above developments pertaining to ROTHMAN.

On 9/8/59, Miss DOROTHY SCHWEINHAUT, Passport

Office, State Departnent, Miami, Fla., made available for

examination a passport application dated 8/21/59, filed by

NORMAN ROTHMAN, Biltmore Terrace Hotel, Miami Beach. He

was issued passport number 1515395 on 8/25/59.

His application reflected that he intended to

depart from Miami on 9/1/59, by air for South America for

six weeks. This application did not disclose his exact
