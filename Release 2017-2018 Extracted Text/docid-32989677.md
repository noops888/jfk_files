Re: Interview of FBI Special Agent in Charge

Theodore P. Rosack by

U.S. Senate Select Committee Staff Member

On September 23, 1975, Special Agent in Charge (SAC)

Theodore P. Rosack appeared at the Dirksen Office Building,

Washington, D. Ce, Room 6308, at 3:25 p.m. SAC Rosack was

ushered to

an interview room

where an interview was conducted

by Committee Counsel Mike Epstein. Mary Debreo, who was not

introduced, sat in on the interview and maintained notes in

longhand through the interview.

The interview commenced with Mr. Epstein asking

SAC Rosack if he desired to sign an "Advice of Rights"

form

which was done.

A copy of this form is attached.

Mr.

Epstein then requested SAC Rosack to outline his

history

of assignments in the Bureau.

He was advised that SAC Rosack arrived at FBI

Headquarters on assignment in August, 1960, at which time

he was assigned to the Internal Security Section performing

duties in the Communist Party Front Unit. He assisted in

handling some matters relating to counterintelligence

matters and thereafter served with the Training Division

and Inspection Division after which he returned to the

Internal Security Section on assignment in the Sabotage

Unit.

At this point SAC Rosack requested that Me. Epstein

appeared to SAC Rosack that the actual purpose of the Committee

V. So Senate Select Committee

was not to improve the operations of the Federal investigative

agencies since inquiries conducted by the Committee appeared

to have resulted in a disruption of investigative activity much

to the detriment of this country.

Mire Epstein assured SAC

Rosack that the primary purpose u the committee was to enact

legislacion aimed at providing guidslines fox intelligence

operations and that the inquiries vere not to disrupt the

activities of the investigative agencies. It was pointed

• out

to it. Epstein that there was considerable public opinion

Mi. Epstein began asking questions relating to the

southern Christian Leadership Conference (SaLC) and

connections

that sAc Rosack had with the communist infiltration

investigation of the SCLO during his assignment at FBI

Headquarters.

It was observed that Mr. Epstein had three

looseleaf binders which obviously had the copies of FBI

memoranda relaring to this matter and Mr Epstein was requested

to explain for SAC Rosack's benefit why it was necessary for

SAC Rosack to travel to Washingion from Denver for an interview

when the Committee already possessed considerable documented

material

relating to the investigation. lic. Epstein expressed

the opinion that they might not have the entire story and

therefore the interview was

Mr. Ipstein produced several copies of letters to the tielc

relating to counterintelligence program operations wherein

known to the news media through anonymous commnications.

One of these pertained to a denial by the New York Office

about information available to the

to newspapers in the South.

Mit. Epstein requested information

as to why one was denied and a similar request was approved,

both involving the same information. He was advised that these

details relating to the specific documents could not be recalled

but that it appeared obvious that the geographical locations

must have had some bearing on the decisions.

Mr. Epstein also produced a memorandum believed to

be dated November 21, 1964, wherein dissemination of a document

was approved relating to the activities and moral conduct of

Martin Luther King.

This document was disseminated to tie

White Houses

the Vice President Elect, Military Intelligence

agencies, etc.

The memorandum and the dissemination letter

contained the initials of SAC Rosack indicating that he had

dictated these documents.

lic. Epstein requested to know

whether SAC Rosack had written the document which was

designated as an enclosure to these documents.

He was advised

that since SAC Rosack did not have a copy of the document

available he could not say whether or not and, in tact, could

Mr. Epstein was advised that if he could produce a copy of the

document he could be advised one way or another but SAC Rosack's

memory was not that good after such a lapse of time.

Mr. Epstein on several occasions returned to questioning

as to whether SAC Rosaci during the early sixties participated

in policy making decisions relating to the SCLC.

repeatedly advised that SAC Rosack was at that time in no

position to make such decisions

and that most of the decisions

were made as a result of conferences, consultations and

recommendations.

SAC Rosack was also asked if he was acquainted with

a Mr. Harrington.

He advised this may refer to John I.

Harrington, who had been assigned to the Communist Party

Front Unit and who was deceased.

He was also asked if he was

acquainted with Bill fossyth.

The answer was again in the

affirmative with a statement that it was believed that foimer

SA Forsych was also deceased.

A discussion then took place regarding the

relationship in the

• Bureau between former Section Chiefs

Fred Baumgardner and Jim Bland. Mc. Epstein had some

difficulty in understanding the structure of the Bureau

and appeared to believe that Mr. Bland had been a

Chief under Me. Baumgardner in the Internal Security Section.

He was advised that was. not so and that Mir. Bland served as

Section Chief in the Subversive Control Section which had

responsibility for investigations of individuals and that

Mr. Baumgardner as head of the Internal Security Section

had primary responsibility of investigating organizations.

Interview of SAC Rosack by

U. S. Senate Select Committee

Mr. Epstein asked who had been the head of the

Counterintelligence Unit and SAC Rosack replied that it

had been Herman O. Bly who was succeeded by Arthur W.

Ware.

He requested the whereabouts of these two individuals

and was advised that this was not known by SAC Rusack.

A discussion took place again regarding the

investigations being conducted by the committee and Mr.

Epstein was advised that the best manner in which this

inquiry could be conducted would be to re-establish the

same conditions and the climate in existence during the

sixties.

He was advised that any decisions made were

in the best interest of the entire country and that it was

extremely easy to "Monday morning quarterback" activities

which took place years ago.

He was advised that under the

same conditions and with the same situation in existence

SAC Rosack would more than likely conduct himself in the

same manner as he had in the past.

Mr. Epstein was advised

SAC Rosack was extremely proud of his actions as an FBI

Agent and that activities of the Bureau were not conducted

primarily for the greater glory of any one man or any one

Bureau but were actually conducted Ior the good oi the

country.

Mr. Epstein then desired to know why copies or a

document pertaining to the moral activities of hartir

Luther King had been disseminated to then Vice President Elect

Hubert Humphrey. It was pointed out to Mi. Epstein

according to the copy viewed it was not only disseminated

to Mr. Humphrey but also disseminated to the White House

and officials within the Department of Justice and to the

pointed out to Mt.

Epstein that a portion of the FBI

responsibilities is to keep the Executive Branch of the

Government advised of matters relating to the Internal

security of the country.

The questioning of SAC Rosack terminated for

all practical purposes at approximately 4:20 p.m. at

which time it was suggested to MI. Epstein that a portion

of his efforts should be directed toward attempting to

obtain some civil rights for law enforcement officers, since

they have none.

Conference (SCLC).

This memo in essence recommended approval

of a Communist infiltration investigation of the SCLC and

proposed sending a letter to the New York and Atlanta Offices,

believed dated October 23, 1962, instructing those offices to

begin investigation.

Mr. Epstein wis interested in the reasons

and the background which prompted the recommendation for this

investigation.

He asked Mr. Rampton if those initials (RJR)

on the two documents represented Mr. Rampton as the aictator.

Mr. Rampton replied they were his initials and that he recalled

writing these documents.

MI. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton how he obtained

information to compose thee documents which indicate Stanley

David Levison, a secret member of the Communist Party (CP)

and

Hunter Pitts O'Fell, a member of the National Committee of

the CP were associated with Dr. Martin Luther King, head of

the SCLC. Mr. Rampton replied he could not specifically recall

how the information came to his attention, but that it would

be normal for him to receive reports from various sources,

such as

field offices and other units at the Bureau which may

have referred to the association of Dr. King with CP members.

Mr. Epstein asked Mi. Rampton whether the Bureau required

field offices to report on racial incidents, such as sit-ins,

anâ Mr. Rampton replied field offices were normally required

to report any incidents of civil strife which would be disseminated

to appropriate agencies of the Executive Branch such as the

Department of Justice and the White House.

The context of

this question was whether reporting on racial incidents might

influence Mr. Rampton or other Bureau officials to focus

attention on the SCLC and Dr. Martin Luther King. Mi. Rampton

told Mr. Epstein such matters would not normally come to his

attention and the thing that focused Mr. Rampton's attention

on the SCLC and Dr. Martin Luther King was information which

indicated CP attempts to dominate or influence Di. King and the

SCLC.

Mr. Rampton told Mr. Epstein he was not in sympathy

with this inquiry by the SSC and that while he would cooperate,

he desired to point out the inquiry was

the effectiveness of the FBI. Mr. Rampton pointed out the FBI

does not need aditional legislation or rules to circumscribe

its efforts in that the policy oi the Bureau has always been

to protect the rights of citizens and Communist infiltration

investigations are very carefully supervised, stringently

circumscribed and limited in scope to determine the degree

of infiltration or influence subversive organizations have

on legitinate organizations.

Mr. Epstein • asked Mr. Rampton whether Mr. Rampton

was aware of such matters as sit-ins, racial incidents and

so forth. Mr. Rampton replied that he read the newspapers

and may have saen memoranda which incidentally referred to

such information, but that it was not the area of Mr. Rampton's

specific interest in the Communist Front Unit and that

Mr.. Rampton, as

a member of that Unit, was required

to review

all reports that might indicate CP or other subversive

organizational activities wherever they might occur.

ME. Epstein asked

Mc. Rampion Lie purpose vi

Communist infiltration investigations whereupon he showed

Mr. Rampton copies of pages containing specific references

from Section 87E of the FBI Manual of Instructions which

contain FBI policy concerning Communist infiltration investigations.

Mr. Rampton explained to Mr. Epstein that the purpose of the

Communist infiltration investigation was to determine whether

or not the CP was dominating or influenting a legitimate

organization, such as the SCLC.

ir. Rampton explained these

investigations had to be authorized by the Bureau,

that the

field did not have the prerogative to begin these investigations,

and that such investigations were strictly limited in

scope.

Mx. Rampton explained that it is not now and was not then

permissible to develop informants and sources in the legitimate

sources were developed in the subversive

organization, which was infiltrating the legitimate organization.

Mr. Epstein asked if it

permissible to direct these

sources to join the legitimate organization and Mr. Rampton

replied that it was not permissible to do so; however, if the

sources were invited to join, the

handling Agent had

to avoid

any direction of the source's activities in the legitimate

organization, which would influence the normal activities of

the legitimate organization.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMiTTEE

(SSC) ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J..

RAMPTON BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Epstein asked if the ultimate objective of

the Comnunist infiltration investigation would be to make

the organization a Communist fron. so that an all out

investigation could be conducted.

Mr. Rampton replied this

was not the objective, but if, in effect, the CP or other

subversive organization reached the point where it controlled

ari directed the activities of the legitimate organization,

it was conceivable the organization would then be considered

a Communist front and become of wider investigative interest

to the FBI. Mr. Ipstein asked Mr. Rampton if he could

recall any legitimate organizations becoming front

organizations through infiltration. Mr.

Rampton replied he

could not recall specifically, but did not rule out this

had occurred in some instances.

Mr. Epstein directed attention to a memorandum

written in June 1962 by deceased Agent William Forsyth, which

memorandum. instructed Atlanta and New York to remain alert

to Communist attempts to influence the SCLC.

Mr. Epstein

ackod if Ma. Rampton lner Mr. Forayth and was aware of that

memorandum which also mentioned and was possibly captioned

Stanley David Levison and Hunter

• Pitts O'Deil. Mr. Rampton

he could not remember Mr. Forsyth, but the name

seemed

vaguely familiar and could not remember the memorandum itself

but could not rule out the possibility of having read it.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether this memorandum might

have contained the basis for Mr. Rampton preparing the

memorandum of October 22, 1962, to recommend the Communist

infiltration investigation of the SCLC. Mr. Rampton replied

he could not be sure since he could not remember the

memorandum specifically.

There was a reference in Mr. Rampton's memorandum

of October 22, 1902, to the effect intormation had been received

the CP may be exerting an influence on the SCLC and then later

in the same paragraph a reference to the CP connection of

Levison and O'Dell who were associated with Dr. King.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether the first reference

was roughly equivalent

to the second reference. Mi. Rampton

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

(SSC) ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE:

INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J..

RAMPION BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

advised he could not be sure since he could not recall what

was available to him in 1962 which led to the phraseology

mentioned above.

A reference was made in one of the documents which

apparently was a letter to Atlanta and New York written

in 1962 requesting these offices to review files and make

recommendations to the Bureau concerning a Communist infiltration

investigation of the SCLC.

Mi. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton

whether this amounted, to an instruction to the field to

make a positive recommendation to investigate the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton replied it was not an instruction to the field

to make a positive

recommendation; that what Mr. Rampton

obviously had in mind was to determine the facts from the

field reports; and to analyze the

facts then decide whether

to recommend

an investigation be instituted. Mr. Epstein

indicated he believed such terminology was tantamount to an

instruction to the field to come back with a positive

recommendation and it would be unlikely the field would

come

bach with

a négäiive sei di facio.

Mi. Rampion suit this

was an unjustifiable conclusion and if Mr. Epstein understood

Bureau terminology he would realize the field would have

recommended action according to the facts at hand. Mr. Epstein

asked whether conferences were held by Mr. Rampton and other

Bureau officials which resulted in focusing attention on

the SCLC and Di. King. Mr. Rampton replied he could not

recall any conferences which would have resulted in a decision

to focus attention on the SCLC of DI. King, but that it was

possible reports received from the field which indicate CP

influence with Dr. King would have been discussed with members

of the Communist Front Unit. In any event Mr. Rampton

said the review of reports from various sources was a

continuing assignment and when Mr. Rampton became aware of

CP influence on the SCLC it was his job to analyze this and

present a recommendation which had to be approved at

higher level for a Communist

infiltration investigation of

the SCIC.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether he had

ordered disruptive techniques to be used against the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton replied that he had not and wouldn't have done

so since the SCLC was a

• legitimate organization. Mr. Epstein

asked if Mr. Rampton had engaged in COINTELPRO activities

in regard to this or other investigations and Mr. Rampton

replied that he was not cleared to discuss COINTELPRO with

Mr.

Epstein.

Mr. Epstein referred to a wiretap on Dr. King

and asked Mr. Rampton whether he could have authorized sush

an unusual technique when he first made the recommendation

for the Communist infiltration investigation of the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton told Mr. Epstein he had no personal information

concerning the "so-called" wiretap on Dr. King (Mr. Epstein

advised Mr. Rampton such a wiretap was authorized in connection

in October 1963.), but in any event wiretaps had to be

approved by the Attorney General anú sufficient information

would have to be available to justify asking the Attorney

The facts which existed

in October 1962 were not supportive of such a request;

Mr. Rampton pointed out.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampion whether or not

Dr. King was on the Reserve Index or Security Index when the

Communist infiltration investigation was ordered. Mr. Rampton

repiieù inai it was sui andie of any sich designution Evi

DI. King.

Mr. Epstein asked whether COINTELPRO operations

were considered concerning the scue and then he added he

would not get into this area, after looking at the memoranda

before him, because it was "after Mr. Rampton's time."

This was a reference to the fact that Mr. Rampton was

transferred from the Communist Front Unit in late 1962.

Re: Interview of FBI Special Agent in Charge

Theodore P. Rosack by

U. S. Senate Select Committee Staff lember

On September 23, 1975, Special Agent in Charge (SAC)

Theodore P. Rosack appeared at the Dirksen Office Building,

Washington, D. Co, Room 6308, at 3:25 p.m. SAC Rosack was

an interview room

where an interview was conducted

by Committee Counsel Mike Epstein. Mary DeOreo, who was not

introduced, sat in on the interview and maintained notes it

longhand through the interview.

The interview commenced with Mc. Epstein asking

SAC Rosack if he desired to sign an "Advice of Rights" form

which was done. A copy of this form is attached.

Epstein then requested SAC Rosack to outline his history

of assignments in the Bureau.

He was advised that SAC Rosack arrived at FBI

Headquarters on assignment in August, 1960, at which time

he was assigned to the Internal Security Section performing

duties in the Communist Party Front Unit. He assisted in

handling some matters relating to counterintelligence

matters and thereafter served with the Training Division

and Inspection Division after which he returned to the

Unit.

At this point SAC Rosack requested that Mr. Epstein

Interview of SAC Rosack by

U. S. Senate Select Committee

was not to improve the operations of the Federal investigative

agencies since inquiries conducted by the committee appeared

to have resulted in a disruption of investigative activity much

Mr. Epstein assured SAC

Rosack that the primary purpose of the Committee was to enact

legislation aimed at providing guidelines for intelligence

operations and that the inquiries were not to disrupt the

It was pointed out

to Mr. Epstein that there was considerable public opinior

against the activities of the Committee in this country and

that a number of individuals were quite disturbed since it

appeared that the investigative agencies, such as Blinquiries

and Military Intelligence agencies were

conducted.

Mr. Epstein began asking questions relating to the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the

connections that SAC Rosack had with the Commnist infiltration

investigation of the SCLC during his assignment at FBI

Headquarters.

It was observed that Mc. Epstein had three

looseleaf binders which obviously had the copies of FBI

memoranda relating to this matter and Mr. Epstein was requested

to explain for SAC Rosack's benefit why it was necessary for

SAC Rosack to travel to Washington from Denver for an interview

when the committee already possessed considerable documented

material relating to the investigation.

Mc. Epstein expressed

the opinion that they might not have the entire story and

therefore the interview was necessary.

Mr. Epstein asked SAC Rosack whether the discussions

relating to the opening of the investigation on the SCLC were

participated in by SAC Rosack.

Mr. Epstein was advised that

SAC Rosack at the time was merely a supervisor in a unit at

the Bureau and did not engage in policy-making decisions.

Mr. Epstein produced several copies of letters to the field

relating to counterintelligence program operations wherein

Hunter Pitts O'Dell's Communist affiliations were to be made

known to the news media through anonymous communications.

One of these pertained to a denial by the New York Office

about information available to the "Amsterdam News."

The

second document approved dissemination of such information

to newspapers in the South.

Mr. Epstein requested information

to why one was denied and a similar request was

approved,

both involving the same information.

He was advised that these

letails relating to the specific documents could not be recallec

but that it appeared obvious that the geographical locations

must have had some bearing on the decisions.

Interview of SAC Rosack by

U. S. Senate Select Committee

MI. Epstein also produced a memorandum believed to

be dated November 21, 1964, wherein dissemination of a document

was approved relating to the activities and moral conduct of

Martin Luther King•

This document was disseminated to the

White House, the Vice President Elect, Military Intelligence

agencies, etc.

The memorandum and the dissemination letter

contained the initials of SAG Rosack indicating that he had

dictated these documents.

Mr. Epstein requested to know

whether SAC Rosack had written the document which was

designated as an enclosure to these documents.

He was advised

that since SAG Rosack did not have a copy of the document

available he could not say whether or not and, in fact, could

not recall who had prepared the information for dissemination.

Mr. Epstein was advised that if he could produce a copy of the

document he could be advised one way or another but SAC Rosack's

memory was not that good after such a lapse of time.

* no that soot

Mr. Epstein on several occasions returned to questioning

as to whether SAC Rosack during the early sixties participated

in policy-making decisions relating to the SCLC.

He was

repeatedly advised that SAC Rosack was at that time in no

position to make such decisions and that most of the decisions

were made as a result of conferences, consultations and

recommendations.

SAC Rosack was also asked if he was acquainted with

a Mr. Harrington.

He advised this may refer to John T.

Harrington, who had been assigned to the Conmunist Party

Front Unit

and who was deceased. He was also asked if he was

acquainted with Bill Forsyth.

The answer was again in the

affirmative with a statement

that it was believed that former

SA Forsyth was also deceased.

I discussion then took place regarding th

elationship in the Bureau between former Section Chief

Fred Baumgardner and Jim Bland.

Mr. Epstein had some

difficulty in understanding the structure of the Bureau

and appeared to believe that Mr. Bland had been a Unit

Chief under Mr. Baumgardner in the Internal Security Section.

He was advised

that was not so and that Mr. Bland served as

Section Chief in the Subversive Control Section which had

responsibility for investigations of individuals and that

Mr. Baumgardner as head of the Internal Security Section

had primary responsibility of investigating organizations.

Interview of SAC Rosack by

U. S. Senate Select Committee

Mr. Epstein asked who had been the head of the

Counterintelligence Unit and SAC Rosack replied that it

had been Herman O. Bly who was succeeded by Arthur W.

Ware. He requested the whereabouts of these two individuals

and was advised that this was not known by SAC Rosack.

A discussion took place again regarding the

investigations being conducted by the Committee and Mr.

Epstein was advised that the best manner in which this

inquiry could be conducted would be to re-establish the

same conditions and the climate in existence during the

sixties. He was advised that any decisions made were

in the best interest of the entire country and that it was

extremely easy to "Monday morning quarterback" activities

which took place years ago.

He was advised that under the

same conditions and with the same situation in existence

SAC Rosack would more than likely conduct himself in the

same manner as he had in the past.

Mr. Epstein was advised

SAC Rosack was extremely proud of his actions as an FBI

Agent and that activities of the Bureau were not conducted

primarily for the greater glory of any one man or any one

Bureau

but were actually conducted for the good of the

country.

they have none.

On September 23, 1975, Senate Select Committee (SSC)

Stafi Member Michael T. Epstein interviewed Special Agent in

Charge Ralph J. Rampton in the building located across C Street

from the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.,

in the presence of Staff Member Mary De Oreo, who took notes

for Mr. Epstein.

The interview began at 1:37 pm, and concluded

at 3:07 pm.

At the outset of the interview Mr. Rampton was

presented an Advice of Rights Form which Mr. Rampton was

reguested to sign. A copy of this form containing the

signatures of Mr. Rampton, Miss De Oreo and Mr. Epstein is

attached.

Following the signing of the Advice of Rights Form

the interview began with Mr. Epstein requesting Mr. Rampton to

briefly review his assignments in the Bureau, beginning with

his assignment to the Communist Front Unit at Bureau Headquarters

in 1960.

After Mr. Rampton gave this background information

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton to reaû an FBI memorandum dated

Conference (SCLC) .

This memo in essence recommended approval

of a Communist infiltration investigation of the SCLC and

proposed sending a letter to the New York and Atlanta Offices,

believed dated October 23, 1962, instructing those offices to.

begin investigation.

Mr. Epstein was interested in the reasons

and the background which prompted the recommendation for this

investigation. He asked Mr. Rampton if those initials (RJR)

on the two documents represented Mr.

Rampton as the dictator.

Mr. Rampton replied they were his initials and that he recalled

writing these documents.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton how he obtained

information to compose these documents which indicate Stanley

David Levison,

a secret member of the Communist Party (CP) and

Hunter Pitts O'Dell, a member of the National Committee of

the CP were associated with Dr. Martin Luther King, head of

the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton replied

l he could not specifically recall

how the information came to his attention, but that it would

be normal for him to receive reports from

various sources,

such as field offices and other units at the Bureau which may

have referred to the

association of Dr. King with CP members.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether the Bureau required

field offices to report on racial incidents, such as sit-ins,

and Mr. Rampton replied field offices were normally required

to report any incidents of civil strife which would be disseminated

to appropriate agencies of the Executive Branch such as the

Department of Justice and the White House.

The context of

this question was whether reporting on racial incidents might

influence Mr. Rampton or other Bureau officials to focus

attention on the SCLC and Dr. Martin Luther King. Mr. Rampton

told Mr. Epstein such matters would not normally come to his

attention and the thing that focused Mr. Rampton's attention

on the SCLC and Dr. Martin Luther King was information which

indicated CP attempts to dominate or influence Dr. King and the

SCIC.

Mr. Rampton told Mr. Epstein he was not in sympathy

with this inquiry by the SSC and that while he would cooperate,

he desired to point out the inquiry was reducing

the effectiveness of the FBI. Mr. Rampton pointed out the FBI

does not need additional legislation or rules to circumscribe

its efforts in that the policy of the Bureau has always-been ...

to protect the rights of citizens and Communist infiltration

investigations are very carefully supervised, stringently

circumscribed and limited in scope to determine the degree

of infiltration or influence

subversive organizations have

on legitimate organizations.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether Mr. Rampton

was

aware of such matters as sit-ins, racial incidents and

so forth. Mr. Rampton replied that he read the newspapers

and may have seen memoranda which incidentally referred to

such information, but that it was not the area of Mr. Rampton's

specific interest in the Communist Front Unit and that

Mr. Rampton, as a member of that Unit, was required to review

all reports that might indicate CP or other subversive

organizational activities wherever they might occur.

itt. Epsiein asseù it. Ramuin ine purpuse u

Communist infiltration investigations whereupon he showed

Mr. Rampton copies of pages containing specific references

from Section 87E of the FBI Manual of Instructions which

contain FBI policy concerning Communist infiltration investigations.

Mr. Rampton explained to Mr. Epstein that the purpose of the

Communist infiltration investigation was to determine whether

or not the CP was dominating or influenting a legitimate

organization, such

as the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton explained these

investigations had to be authorized by the Bureau, that the

field did not have the prerogative to begin these

investigations,

that such investigations were strictly limited in scope.

Rampton explained that it is not now and was not then

permissible to develop informants and sources in the legitimate

organization, but that sources were developed in the subversive

organization, which was infiltrating the legitimate arganization.

Mr. Epstein asked if it was permissible to direct these

sources to join the legitimate organization and Mr. Rampton

replied that it was not permissible to do so; however, if the

sources were invited to join, the handling Agent had to avoid

any direction of the source's

activities in the legitimate

organization, which would influence the normal activities of

the legitimate organization.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

(SSC) ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J.

RAMPTON BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Epstein asked if the ultimate objective of

the Communist infiltration investigation would be to make

the organization a Communist front so that an all out

investigation could be conducted.

Mr. Rampton replied this

was not the objective, but if, in effect, the CP or other

subversive organization reached the point where it controlled

and directed the activities of the legitimate organization,

it was conceivable the organization would then be considered

a Communist front and become of wider investigative interest

to the FBI. Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton if he could

recall any legitimate organizations becoming front

organizations through infiltration.

Mr. Rampton replied he

could not recall specifically, but did not rule out this

had occurred in some instances.

Mr. Epstein directed attention to a memorandum

written in June 1962 by deceased Agent William Forsyth, which

memorandum instructed Atlanta and New York to remain alert

to Communist attempts to influence the SCLC. Mr. Epstein

asked if Mr. Rampton know Mr. Enrsyth and was aware of that

memorandum which

also mentioned and was possibly captioned

Stanley David Levison and Hunter Pitts O'Dell.

Mr. Rampton

advised he could not remember Mr. Forsyth, but the name seemed

vaguely familiar

and could not remember the memorandum itself

but could not rule out the possibility of having read it.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr.

Rampton whether this memorandum might

have contained the basis for Mr. Rampton preparing the

memorandum of October 22, 1962, to recommend the Communist

infiltration investigation of the SCLC. MI. Rampton replied

in eate ation de doe

he could not be sure since he could not remember the

There was a reference in Mr. Rampton's memorandum

of October 22, 1962, to the effect information had been received

in the

same paragraph a reference

to the CP connection of

Levison and O'Dell who were associated with Dr. King.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether the first reference

was roughly equivalent to the second reference. Mr. Rampton

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

(SSC) ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J.

RAMPTON BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

advised he could not be sure since he could not recall what

was available to him in 1962 which led to the phraseology

mentioned above.

A reference was made in one of the documents which

apparently was a letter to Atlanta and New York written

in 1962 requesting these offices to review files and make

recommendations to the Bureau concerning a Communist infiltration

investigation of the SCIC.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton

whether this

amounted to an instruction to the field to

make a positive recommendation to investigate the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton replied it was not an instruction to the field

to make a positive

recommendation; that what Mr. Rampton

obviously had in mind was to determine the facts from the

field reports; and to analyze the facts then decide whether

to recommend an investigation be instituted.

Mr. Epstein

indicated he believed

such terminology was

tantamount to an

instruction to the field to come back with a positive

recommendation and it would be unlikely the field would come

Läch with a ieyaiive set of fails.

Mr. Rampton said this

was an unjustifiable conclusion

and if Mr. Epstein understood

Bureau terminology he would realize the field would have

recommended action according to the facts at hand. Mr. Epstein

asked whether conferences were held by Mr. Rampton and other

Bureau officials which resulted in focusing

attention on

the SCLC and Dr. King. Mr. Rampton replied he could not

recall any conferences which would have resulted in a decision

to focus attention on the SCLC or Dr. King, but that it was

possible reports received from the field which indicate CP

influence with Dr. King would have been discussed with members

of the Communist Front Unit.

In any event Mr. Rampton

said the review of reports from various sources was a

continuing assignment and when Mr. Rampton became aware of

CP influence on the SCLC it was his job to analyze this and

present a recommendation which had to be approved at

higher level for a Communist infiltration investigation of

the SCIC.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether he had

ordered disruptive techniques to be used against the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton replied that he had not and wouldn't have done

so since the SCLC was a legitimate organization. Mr. Epstein

asked if Mr. Rampton had engaged in COINTELPRO activities

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

(SSC) ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF SAC RALPH J. RAMPTON

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

in regard to this or other investigations and Mr. Rampton

replied that he was not cleared to discuss COINTELPRO with

Mr. Epstein.

Mr. Epstein referred to a wiretap on DI. King

and asked Mr. Rampton whether he could have authorized such

an unusual technique when he first made the recommendation

for the Communist infiltration investigation of the SCLC.

Mr. Rampton told Mr. Epstein he had no personal information

concerning the "so-called" wiretap on Dr. King (Mr. Epstein

advised Mr. Rampton such

a wiretap was authorized in connection

with the Communist infiltration investigation of the SCIC

in October 1963.), but in any event wiretaps had to be

approved by the Attorney General and sufficient information

would have to be available to justify asking the Attorney

General for such authorization.

The facts which existed

in October 1962 were not supportive of such a request,

Mr. Rampton pointed out.

Mr. Epstein asked Mr. Rampton whether or not

Dr. King was on the

Reserve Index or Security Index when the

Communist infiltration investigation was ordered.

Mr. Rampton

replied that he was nui aware ui auy such designation

fox

DI. King.

Mr. Epstein asked whether COINTELPRO operations

were considered concerning the SCIC and then he added he

would not get into this area, after looking at the memoranda

before him, because it was "after Mr. Rampton's time."

This was a

reference to the fact that Mr. Rampton was

transferred from the Communist Front Unit in late 1962.

Re

Interview of Special Agent JOHN C. SULLIVAN

September 24, 1975

Washington, D. C.

On September 24, 1975, Special Agent (SA) JOHN C. SULLIVAN

was interviewed by Mr. MICHAEL EPSTEIN and MARY DeOREO, members

of the U.S. Senate Select Committee (SSC) at the New Senate Office

Building, Washington, D. C.

→Stass Members

Mr. EPSTEIN presented SA SULLIVAN with an "Advice of

Rights" form requesting that it be read and signed. SA SULLIVAN

signed the form, a copy of which is attached.

Mr. EPSTEIN then presented SA SULLIVAN with a Xeroxcopy

of a New York Office (NYO) airtel dated April 16, 1964, captioned,

"Communist Party-USA Negro Question; Communist Influence in Racial

Matters; IS-C"; "CP-USA, COINTEL; IS-C", and asked if he had written

this airtel. After reading this document, SA SULLIVAN advised

Mr. EPSTEIN that he did not write the document. Mr. EPSTEIN asked

if

the initials, "JCS", on the lower left hand corner of the

first page were his initials. SA SULLIVAN stated that his initials

are "JCS", but that he did not write the document.

Mr. EPSTEIN

then asked SA SULLIVAN if he knew who could have written the

document with the same initials. SA SULLIVAN stated that the

document could have been written by SA JOHN SEATON.

Mr. EPSTEIN

asked where SA SEATON was assigned. He was told that SA SEATON

was last known to be assigned to the Philadelphia Office.

Mr. EPSTEIN then asked SA SULLIVAN what cases were

assigned to him in 1964 in the NYO. SA SULLIVAN stated that most

of his investigations dealt with Racial Matters.

Mr. EPSTEIN

said, like the Black Panther Party, and SA SULLIVAN said yes.

Re:

Re

Interview of Special Agent JOHN C. SULLIVAN

September 24, 1975

Washington, D. C.

Mr. EPSTEIN then asked that if SA SULLIVAN investigated

Racial Matters, why he was not investigating CP-USA Negro Matters.

He was told that one squad usually handled all matters dealing

with the CP, and that CP-Negro Matters and Racial Matters

investigations were not the same, and were handled by different

squads.

Mr. EPSTEIN then asked how the NYO was set up,

such as divisions, etc. He was told that the NYO had divisions

that were then broken down into squads.

Each squad was responsible

for investigating specific classifications.

Mr. EPSTEIN then produced other documents as follows:

Xerox copy of a document captioned, "CP-USA Negro Question-

Communist Infiltration; Racial Matter; IS-C", dated May 21, 1964,

NY file number 100-151649; Xerox copy of Bureau airtel to

New York dated April 13, 1964, captioned, "CP-USA; COINTELPRO;

IS-C; NEGRO QUESTION", Bureau

file number 100-3-104-34; Xerox

copy of Bureau letter to NY captioned, "CP-USA; NEGRO QUESTION",

Bureau file number 100-3-1I0.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked SA SULLIVAN if he was familiar with

any of the above-mentioned documents. SA SULLIVAN stated that

he was not familiar with the above documents.

Mr. EPSTEIN then

asked if SA SULLIVAN conducted any investigation pertaining to the

CP and Mr. STANLEY LEVISON.

SA SULLIVAN stated that the only

investigation he can recall is when he received some documents

and was told to read the documents and disseminate the information

from these documents into the specific file having an interest

in the

subject matter, and did not participate in any active

investigation of the CP in New York.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked who was the supervisor of the squad

investigating CP matters in 1964, and who was SA SULLIVAN's

supervisor in 1964.

SA SULLIVAN

stated that JOHN KEARNEY

was the supervisor of the squad handling the investigation of

the CP, and RAYMOND RUCKEL was his supervisor in 1964.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked what agents handled the investigation

of the CP-USA; COINTELPRO-CP; and CP-Negro Question.

SA SULLIVAN

stated that he did not know, and would only be guessing if

he began to name persons.

Interview of Special Agent JOHN C. SULLIVAN

September 24, 1975

Washington, D. C.

Mr. EPSTEIN then asked who had the initials, "JJK" and

"JMK"

SA SULLIVAN said that "JJK" is probably JOHN KEARNEY,

but did not know who was

"JMK".

Mr. EPSTEIN said, could it be

JAMES KIRBY. SA SULLIVAN said it could be, but he did not

know KIRBY's middle initial.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked who was "JFO",

and SA SULLIVAN said he could not recall who had the initials,

"JFO".

Mr. EPSTEIN asked what stenographers had the initials,

"RMV" and "TNS". SA SULLIVAN said he did not know since the

documents on which these initials appear were typed in 1964.

Mr. EPSTEIN asked if SA SULLIVAN knew ALEXANDER

BURLINSON and where he is at the present time.

SA SULLIVAN

stated that he knew Mr. BURLINSON

and was last known to be living

in Scarsdale, NY.

Miss DeOREO mentioned Civil Rights violations.

SA SULLIVAN stated that Civil Rights

is a separate matter and

has nothing to do with the topics being discussed.

Mr. EPSTEIN then wanted to know if SA SULLIVAN

conducted

his investigation under Section 87 or Section 122 (of the

Manual of Instructions). He was advised that cases were handled

under Section 122. He also expressed an interest as to whether

or not the FBI investigated persons, such as 10 persons conducting a

peaceful picket demonstration.

SA SULLIVAN stated that the FBI

does not investigate peaceful picketing demonstrations, stating that

New York City averages about one strike a day and

sometimes there

may be 5 to 10 demonstrations going on at once.

The interview began at 10:20 a.m. and ended at

11:04 a.m.

INTERVIEW OF

SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE ROBERT C. DENZ

NEW YORK OFFICE, SEPTEMBER 24, 1975,

BY MICHAEL EPSTEIN AND MARY DE OREO

The interview took place in Room G-308, Everetty M.

Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D. C., from

approximately 11:10 a.m. to 11:45 a.m. on September 24, 1975.

Mr. Epstein presented

a one-page typewritten form, pertaining

to "Advice of Rights"

and "Waiver of Rights"

, stating that he

hoped Mr. Denz would sign it. It was read, signed and dated.

A copy was obtained by SAC Denz ander is attached.

In response to career-type questions, SAC Denz

advised the interviewers of his current position in the New

York Office, which he assumed February, 1975, his position as

Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Portland, Oregon, Office

from April, 1974, to January, 1975, and his position of

Assistant Special Agent in Charge in the New York Office from

March, 1973 to April, 1974.

Mr. Denz noted that prior to this

he was assigned to Headquarters.. It was mentioned by Mr. Denz

that the New York Office has five Special Agents in Charge and

one Assistant Director in Charge. Mr. Epstein stated that he

is primarily interested in that point of Mr. Denz's career

which took place at Headquarters.

Mr. Denz advised that he

was transferred from the Detroit Office to Headquarters in

approximately March of 1963 and was assigned to a unit which

had some of the supervisory responsibilities pertaining to

the Communist Party, USA.

possibly six to eight, Mr. Denz was assigned to a unit handling

extremist matters, such as the Ku Klux Klan. As to the first

unit

mentioned, it was explained that there were various

investigations and various subfiles concerning the Communist

Party, such

' as Communist Party

membership, and Communist Party

youth. Mr. Epstein asked the identities of the other individuals

serving in that specific unit.

Mr. Denz replied that he recalls

Special Agents Larry Gurley, Seymor Phillips, and William Shaw.

In response to Mr. Epstein's question, Mr. Denz

advised that, in view of the lapse of time and the fact that

his service in that particular unit was only a matter of months,

all of his assignments could not be recalled. To the best of

memory, Mr. Denz advised that he coordinated

Communist Party

membership figures as

furnished by certain field offices and

believed that at one time he had assigned the subfile on negro

matters.

Mr. Epstein inquired whether this meant "Cominfil",

or Communist

Party infiltration of negro groups. Mr. Denz

advised that he could not recall specifically the lineup in

Division 5, Headquarters, of Communist infiltration cases, but

the Communist Party, USA, negro matters would probably touch

on Communist infiltration as well as negro members in the Com-

munist Party itself.

Mr. Epstein inquired as to the "March

on Washington" of 1963 and specifically, the identity of the

Special Agent handling same, and who would an official of the

Division, as example, an Assistant Director, refer to if he had

a question regarding

the March.

Mr. Denz advised that the

official would, no doubt, go down the line of command to the

Section Chief, and then to the Unit Chief, and then to the

Special Agent handling subject matter. Mr. Epstein was aware

/ that a Mr. Baumgartner was the Section Chief at that time.

AS

to whether the Assistant Director would go directly to the

Special Agent handling the matter, Mr. Denz advised that he

doubted such would be the normal procedure, but indicated that

an official could well have done so on occasion.

Mr. Epstein furnished for review Xerox copies of

a July and an August, 1963, memorandum, which indicated

originated with Special Agent in Charge Denz, along with com-

munications directed to the Attorney General, pertaining to

Communist influence in racial matters and the March on Washing-

ton.

that the memoranda indicate that Mr. Denz had the responsibility

of coordinating field information regarding the March on Wash-

ington and the responsibility of keeping Bureau officials

currently advised. Both

memoranda were of an informative

nature. In reply to Mr. Epstein's questions regarding a review

of files at Headquarters, Mr. Denz explained that probably the

memoranda were based on information furnished by several field

offices, but no doubt files at Headquarters could also have

been reviewed. Mr. Epstein inquired as to Mr. Denz's opinion

of the extent of Communist Party influence on the March on

Washington.

Mr. Denz noted that Mr. Hoover had commented on

one of the memoranda to the effect

that it was an infinitesimal

amount. Mr. Denz stated that he, himself, might not put it in

exactly that manner but agreed, while it was no doubt a logical

target for the Communist Party, there was not that much in-

fluence.

At least one of the memoranda supported this comment.

As to Mr. Epstein's question concerning Special Agent Forsythajs

assignments, he was advised by Mr. Denz that to the best of

memory Special Agent Forsythe handled assignments pertaining

to individual subjects but no specifics were known.

Mx .

Epstein inquired as to Mr. Denz's knowledge of "taps" on

Martin Luther King.

Mr. Denz

replied that he recalls hearing

of same while at Headquarters but cannot recall as to exact

time, place, or any other specific details.

Mr. Epstein concluded the interview, stating his

appreciation for the appearance.

MEMO COVERING TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH L. SCHMIT BEFORE STATE

COUNSEL OF SENATE SELECI COMMITTEE ON INTELIIGENCE

ACTIVITIES

Tuesday, September 16, 1975

I am setting forth, to the best of my recollection, a summation covering

the key points of my testimony in the above captioned matter.

My testimony was taken between 10:05 A.M. and 12:15 P.M. on September 16,

1975, after I had been sworn in by a female stenographer, who recorded

my testimony. Also present were James Dick and Tom Dawson, who intro-

duced themselves as Counsel on the Staff of the Committee. While I was

rather surprised that I was placed under oath (as it was my understanding

that some of the prior witnesses had not been sworn in), I did not have

any problem with this since I had intended that my testimony be entirely

truthful, to the best of my recollection, and it made no difference

whether I was under oath or not.

After Mr. Dick, who was the principal interrogator, indicated that the

purpose of my testimony was to solicit information from me as to the

history of the use of mail intercepts by the Bureau during my assignment

as an ASAC, and. later as SAC of the Espionage & Foreign Intelligence

Division of the New York Office, he informed me of my right to counsel

and reminded me of the fact that I was present voluntarily, and not

under subpeona. I was not asked to sign any document.

At this point, I responded that I wanted the record to reflect that I

was there voluntarily, that I had no problem relaying, to the best of

my recollection, my knowledge of the mail intercept programs, and that

I felt that I had no need for counsel. I stated that I was hopeful that

IN 55285 DocId: 32989677 Page 94

ENCLOSURE 62-116-355-1487

---

## Page 95

by appearing before the Committee's Counsel I could be helpful in some

way

to

the Government in its deliberation of a matter of serious import

in the Soviet counterintelligence espionage field.

At this point, I stated that I wanted the record to reflect that I had

taken an oath while I was in the F.B.I. to restrict the confidentiality

of the information which came to my attention, and not to reveal it

without proper approval from the Bureau and Department of Justice. I

told them

that I had talked to Mr. Paul Daley of the office of the Legal

Counsel of the F.B.I., and to Bill Greger, who I understood was main-

taining liaison with the Committee, but that I had not refreshed my

recollection in any way prior to my appearance. I also informed the

Counsel that since nearly 10 years had elapsed since I retired from the

F.B.I., and even more time since I had been exposed to the mail intercept

program, that there would be some details concerning which I would un-

doubtedly be very hazy. I also said that I had been instructed by the

Bureau that I was released from my confidentiality only to the extent

of discussing the mail intercept programs and that I was not permitted

in my testimony to reveal any information touching on the following four

points:

1. Information provided by sources (or any other information) which

might tend to identify confidential source.

2. Information concerning sensitive investigative techniques.

3. Information derived from other government agencies, including

information from foreign intelligence source.

4. Any information disclosure which could adversely affect on-going

investigation.

In response to specific questions by the Staff, the following is a summary

of my testimony on the various points indicated, it being noted that. I did

not volunteer any information:

zation

Considerable testimony was given outlining the complete organization of the

New York office upon my arrival, including the four main divisions, who was

in charge of each division, supervisory organization, section and squad

break-down in Division 3, together with the identities of the supervisors

in charge of each section and the various responsibilities of each section.

This was furnished in considerable detail, as well as the general organi-

zation structure during my remaining assignment to the New York office.

Mail Intercept Programs

Upon being asked to outline my knowledge of the mail intercept programs,

I recalled that there were several programs in existence in my division,

but that I could only recall the names of two - namely, SAM Survey and GUS

Survey. A considerable amount of my testimony was given to SAM Survey,

what it consisted of, where it operated, under whose supervision, how ap-

proved, etc. I stated that my recollection of details was extremely

sketchy, but I furnished the following as my general recollection.

Upon my assignment as ASAC of Espionage & Foreign Intelligence work in New

York, I soon became aware that there was undoubtedly an illegal Soviet net-

work operating in this country, which had not been successfully penetrated.

The basis for this conclusion was generally Abel Case and other information

coming to my attention. As a result of various investigations and informa-

tion developed, it became obvious that one of the main methods of communi-

cation by illegal agents to their Soviet

superiors was through

the use of

the U. S. Mail. Based upon this conclusion, information was relayed to F.B.I.

Headquarters that the only way to penetrate this illegal Soviet network was

to have access to the network the Soviets were using. As a result,

Government approval was obtained to set up SAM Survey. I could not recall

the details as to the manner in which it was set up, but the thrust of the

DocId: 32989677 Page 97

• Mail Intercept Pro

ams (Cont'd.)

interrogationpressed as to obtaining details in this area. I stated

generally that Bureau approval had to be obtained, that I did not know

who in Washington had been consulted, but that certainly the Officials

in the U. S. Post Office would have to give approval for us to implement

the plan in New York.

I said I could not say that Mr. Hoover had per-

sonally approved this, but in response to a question, I said that the

importance of the program was such that I felt that his personal approval

would have been necessary. As to any oral conversations I may have had

with Bureau Officials in Washington, I said that it would be my recol-

lection that they would have been limited to either A. H. Belmont or

D. E. Moore, and possibly Bill Branigan.

Considerable emphasis was placed on whether the Attorney General had

approved the program, or whether any Attorney General was aware of the

mail intercept program. I responded that the answer to these questions

could best be secured from the Bureau Headquarters in Washington, since

I did not know the answers.

I was specifically asked whether there was any possibility that former

Attorney General Robert Kennedy was aware of the program. I then

related that sometime during 1962 or 1963, the then Attorney General

Robert Kennedy came to the New York office to attend a criminal intel-

ligence conference, at which time he desired to be briefed on highlights

of our counterintelligence efforts against Soviet espionage and, as I

recall, I handled the briefing of Mr. Kennedy. I said I could not recall

any specifics of the briefing, whether mail intercepts had been mentioned

or not, and it would be unfair for me to say either way.

Mail Intercept Programs (Cont'a.)

Staff Counsel spent some time inquiring as to who else was present at this

conference, and I related the identities of a number of people I recalled,

including former Assistant Directors John Malone and Courtney Evans, as

well as a Public Relations man from the Department of Justice who accom-

panied Mr. Kennedy. I indicated that there also were a number of other

Bureau Officials assigned to the New York office, as well as New York

Supervisors present.

Again, in response to detailed questioning, I indicated that I could not

recall the identities of any Agents who personally worked on the SAM Survey,

with the exception of Jim Kehoe and George Quinn, except that Quinn may have

been a Supervisor at the time. The instructions were to select only certain

letters which had certain designated indicators, and they would be brought

to the New York office for further screening. If a letter was believed

suspect, it would be photographed and the mail immediately returned to the

mail facility so that there would be no delay in the mail. I stated that

the program was completely justified and furnished very valuable informa

tion. I could not recall exactly how many illegal Agents were identified

as a result of this program, and that I probably was not permitted to

reveal this data even if I could recall. I could not recall why this pro-

gram, or the related programs, was discontinued, but estimated that it was

discontinued in approximately 1963 or 1964. I was certain they were dis-

continued prior to my retirement from the F.B.I. Upon being unable to

recall the specific purpose of GUS Survey, the Counsel exhibited to me a

copy of an AIRTEL to the Bureau, reflecting that Special Agent Homer Boynton

and myself, pursuant to Bureau instructions, had contacted a Postal Inspector

ms (Cont 'a.)

in New York to set up GUS Survey. The Counsel revealed to me that there

were two other surveys - namely, SUN and "z" coverage, and I said I re-

called generally that these were two other programs set up to assist in

penetrating Soviet espionage, but I honestly could not recall the details

as to the function of these surveys. I stated that I did recall that

they were in operation in my division while I was in charge of the

division.

Considerable time was spent in attempting to elicit the types of communi-

cations which might be intercepted. That is, whether the program was

used solely for the detection of illegal agents, or whether there might

have been some "side benefits" which would assist the Bureau in further

criminal or internal security matters. I told them that this could not

have happened because of the parameters and instructions set up by the

Bureau and the New York office to the Agents who were handling the pro-

gram. I said that while I did not become involved in the details, and

could not certify absolutely, that I was confident that the program was

only used for the purposes for which it was instituted.

In summation, while many of my answers reflected a truly hazy recollection,

the members of the Staff Counsel accepted this fact and did not press

me for more detailed responses.

Legality of the Mail Intercept Programs

It was interesting to observe that Mr. Dick approached this question by

making the following statement: "I assume that there was no question in

your mind as to the legality of the mail intercept program". My response

follows:

There was no question in my mind but that the Bureau and its

personnel acted properly in this matter. There were volumes of information

NW 55285 DocId:32989677 Page 100

Legality of the Mail Intercept Programs (Cont'a.)

and intelligence data revealing

that the Soviet espionage system, on a

world wide basis, and its illegal network, posed a serious threat to the

internal security.of the country. The Government, by Presidential directive,

had placed the responsibility on the F.B.I. to uncover these illegal net-

works, not only to protect the internal security, but the American people.

In discharging this responsibility, Mr. Hoover assigned me to New York to

supervise the Bureau's

efforts in the New York area. Upon determining what

investigative techniques were necessary, Bureau Headquarters, in my opinion,

sought the proper Government approval to be placed in a position to dis-

charge its responsibilities. The mail intercept program was devised for

this purpose.

The results reflected a major achievement in penetration of

the illegal Soviet network never previously attained by the United States

Government. Just as the Government, in its wisdom, had made available to

the agency responsible for this important phase of National security, it

made a serious error in taking this capability away from its agents. I

was hopeful that one of the main thrusts of the Committee was not to cripple

the Intelligence community by taking away from it its capability to

penetrate and control Soviet espionage in the United States. I said that

failure to do so would be a disservice to the American people and increase

our threat to our country. I commented that requiring the F.B.I., or any

Goverment Agency, who the Government - in its wisdom - chose to discharge

this responsibility, to do so without the appropriate investigative tech-

niques, would be like asking the Pentagon to send the Armed Forces overseas

to fight a war, but to refuse to furnish them any weapons.

I concluded my comments by expressing the hope that my appearance before the

Committee was helpful and that I would be happy to cooperate in any future

MH 55285 DocId: 32989677 Page 101

## Page 102

manner in which I could be of assistance to either the Committee or the

Government in any way. At the conclusion, I was thanked for my coopera-

tion and upon being informed that I would be permitted to read a

transcript of my testimony if I so desired, I indicated that I would

probably avail myself of this opportunity.

ADDENDUM BX INSPECTION DIVISION

v The Internal Security Section, Domestic Intelligence Divisior (Ei9).*:

r'equested one additional supervisor to be assigned to that Section on a ten 3o2?:.

tols

to handle case assignments vacated by two experienced supervisors whom DID Corrus

to devote full time to directing field efforts, correlating results, and prezaring io:

dissemination investigative information obtained resulting from strongly implied Cin-

munist Party (C?) efforts to infiltrate and dominate noncommunist racial groups

encris

in the Summer of 1964 to whip the racial situation to a peak period of disturbaaces.

Urgency for the FBI to "stay ahead" of the situation is cied to pending civil righis

legislation and foreseeable ramifications arising out of the complex political situations

in an election year where civil rights and social disturbances will play a key role in

campaign efforts and possibly election results.

The assigning of full-time personnel to the proposed correlation assignments

is considered to be established by recent occurrences not set out by DID in its request

and which tend to validate observations that the CP is eager to capitalize on, and control

if it can, the efforts of racial groups. (1) Demonstration at World's Fair opening, April,

196, resulted in a number of arrests and there was a definite indication of communist

participation as well as direction of demonstrations. (2) Cn 5/18/84 New York State

was the scene of state-wide demonstrations against school segregation. Communisis

participated and in other weys were involved. (3) Plans are underway for some form

of small size march oi i: -ington 6/15/64 relative to civil rights legislation presently

being debated in the Serai. Communists are involvea in this planned activity. (1)

During the last two weets St. Augustine, florida, has been the scene of a number of

racial demonstratica:

Viartin Luther King, Jt., an individual of extreme importance

to the Bureau from ar investigative standpoint has rented a cottaze in this area for three

months where it is anticipated he will become involved in long-rage plans to demon-

strate in that area, (5) Cambridge, Maryland, for

some time ne seat of numerous

demonstrations, is of interest oscause of the influence in these demonstrations of one

of the party's national com nittee members. (6) There is some indication of a large

civil rights raily to be heid in Chicago some time in June, 1964, where communist

influence and participation are expected. (7) Martin Luther King and others have been

recruiting college students from various parts of the country-to participate in a mass

voter registration project in the State of Mississippi. The usual communist elements

are expecte to be involved. (8) Plans are already underway for some racial activity

to take place in commemoration of the 3/28/53 march on Washingion and information

has been receivea indicating a nationwide wors stoppage will be made. The above are

a sumpling of the CD's interest in the race movement.

The at ve are among the considersions which the two agents assigned to

the scecial prog. a would have to follow, co relate and dissercinate, i necessary.

I. accition to icl.ving and analyzing the fow of information already cu. ing .com the

field, in anticipa.. Ja of the need to more early definethe extent of CP Influence in

the racial movement, DID recently issued inscructions to the field to direct ine fields.

the rea: future.

The two Agents designated to handle the special assignment have substantial

case inas at this time and would con mue to handle some of the same cases they are

now supervising because of their pertica to the proposed assignment; nowever, as

of 6/2/6, 78 cases of one supervisu:: d £9 (total 147) of the other would have to be

reassigned to other supervisors in ta:. "e al Security Section for handling if the two

Agents were assigned full time to the suposed project. Recent figures (5/20/64)

indicate the Internal Security Section hac 19 Social Agents assigned to supervise 3293

cases. As of January, 1964, this section had 2928 cases and 22 supervisors or an

increase of 365 cases and a decrease of 3 supervisors. The overtime of the Internal

Security Section has been consistent with the Division's overtime for two months and

above the Division's overtime three of the last five months for which figures are avail-

able. In all instances, the overtime has been substantially above two hours. In

addition, since 1/2/54, the Internal Security Section has had a total of 279 items or an

average of 12. 6 items per week delinquent which it estimates would take approximately

19 additional hours per week to clear, implying that the present staff is not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS

The Internal Security Section of DID in recognition of the need

for concentrated attention being given to the strongly implied CP

interest in the racial situation has proposed assigning on a temporary basis two of its

experience supervisors to the direction and correlation of a program designed to give

closer scrüiny to developments arising out of communisi interest in racial groups.

To accomplist this, that section has requested te assignment of one Agent supervisor

who will handle a portion of approximately 14? Cases aow supervised by two Agents

ant would be left unassigned aiter tze assignments of the two mên to the special project.

Surplus assignments over and above those which one Agent could handle would be parcele:

out among other supervisors in the Section. The implied necessity for the next few

months of special attention being given to CP interests in and ambitions to control the

race picture is recognizable to the inspection Division and other cata obtained in survey-

ing the DID request for one man on a temporary basis appears to be supported by case

load, overtime, delinquency, end the nature of the cases supervised. The placement

of a Washington Field Citice Agent in this assignment as suggested by DID would, of

courses that is tens so demeanot pisemetto the rite present mee.

The Inspection Div.

RECOMMENDATIONS 1. That one Special Agent be assigned io the Internal Security

Section, Domestic intelligence Division, on temporary

basis. If approved, should be handied by Mr. Monr's Office.

2. That this situation be re-evaluated 10/1/ô4 in view of the

request for temporary assistance. The above date is compatible with Domestic

Intelligence Division and sa ould allow sufficient time for an accurate assessment

of the validity of the progren invoived. I approved, Domestic Intelligence Dir.:

should submit memoran:

"= 10/1/64 evaluating program and making appropriais

recommendations regu's assignment or reassignment of temporary supervisor.

Negro novement, comment was made to the effeci that the Party should

finance people

to go to the scheduled 8/28/63 march on Hashington,

D. C. Jacob Stachel suggested that contact bo made with nationality

groups and clubs in order to gei people for this demonstration.

In view of the above, it is reasonable to ossume that

the future will witness a strong effort on the part of the CPUSA

to inject itself into and to exploit the struggle for equal righis

for Negroes:

Therefore, during the investigation of the CPUSA,

each recipient office should be cutremely aleri to duta ludicating

interest, plans or actual involvenont of the forty in the current

Negro novement. This matter should be given close etcention and

the Bureau lapt currently advised.

In order for the bureau to correlate all the information

presently available, a separate now Bureau file is being opened

under the above caption and each receiving office should do like

wise. Each of these offices should furnish the Burenu by 7/25/63

a summary oi information as contained in its flles and appropriately

documented concerning this matter, even though previously submitted.

This sumnary should be submitted under the above caption.

Future

communications should be expeditiously furnished under appropriate

caption in a form suitable for dissemination, with copies designated

for pertinent files, including 100-3-116.

Coument:

King's obvious reference was to the "renoval" of Buntay Pling

O'Deld fron the Schic.

As

expected, King lied about being verned of

anyone eise because he had been warned about Staaley Levison and has

nevertheloss maintained a close association with levison..

Nost of the progran was devoted to the general subject o1

civil rights and the civil rights bill perding in the Senate.

There will continue to be demonstrations whether or not the

bill passes as its passage is only one step; there must be demonderaticas

ling has not discussed the matter of demonsscations

wich the waits house.

He said he was appalled st eitosts by the

Government to emasculate the bill; refused to name Government offleials

but said they included those of the Justice Department.

Klag has calid

with senate leaders regazding the bill but not during the past few

weeks; he plans to talk to these leaders in the next few doys. ring

clained that he and the other principal Nagzo leaders have conforzed

and vant the bill as pissed by the Icuse.

They will not compromise

on important sections of the bill; he fee?s it vould he better to have

than have the inortant sections deleted.

King said he plans to attead both national party conventions

this summer and mill be aciiva in connection with the seating of

delegates.

His movement may lead & maich at these conventions. Fing

berloves that if the presidentias elections were hold today, President

Johnson would carry the souch ovezwelringly.

He does not intend to

campaign fox any candidate and does not know yet whether or not he will

publicly endorse anyone. He never has in the past. He believes that.

the vest majority of tha people are in favor of the civil rights bill.

He sald thai there is a danger that the Republican Party may becone the

"unite man's pariy" in this countzy. Ho would delinitely not endorse

senator Goldwater,

He rians on some "direct" action in the event the

bill is watered down but has made no final decision as to the type of

action. He has no plans for another narch on Washington this year and

stated he is not at liberty to say what type of action is to take placo.

SUBJECT:

REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

APPEARANCE ON "FACE THE NATION"

SUNDAY, MAY 10, 1964,

12:30 P.M.; CHANNEL 9, WTOP-TV

5: Phsts.

Captioned individual is President of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and was interviewed by a panel of reporters on captioned program.

REFERENCES TO THE DIRECTOR:

King was asked about communist infiltration of the Negro civil rights

movement. He said that to him infiltration implied that a large number of communists

would be found in leadership positions or on a policy-making level. This is not the

case in the civil rights movement.

He went on to say that communism is not freedom but rather is

¡totalitarian in nature, Consequently, communism is incompatible with the civil

rights movement. He said that if there were communists in the movement, he

would like to know so he could get rid of them. He admitted that there may be

one or two individuals who drift into Negro organizations but they are certainly

I not holding down jobs of leadership.

He was asked about the Director's recently released statement

to the effect that some communists were participating in the movement. He said

again that this was not true and that it was "unfortunate that such a great man as

J. Edgar Hoover' would "aid rightists" by such a statement. He said he would

hope rather that the FBI would come out with a statement to the effect that it was

amned that so el Megroes, in view of the to to men l have fee are

turned to communism.

• 6 MAY 18 1964

He said that the Justice Department had informed him concerning

only one communist town to be participating in Kingluerzamzator nd Krug sase

that when given this information he promptly expelled this man from the organization.

M. As Jones to DeLoach Memo

RE: REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

OTHER COMMENTS:

He indicated that Negro organizations still plan demonstrations .

in Alabama to "expose the hypocrisy of Governor Wallace" and that other

demonstrations will occur elsewhere whether or not current civil rights

legislation passes Congress. He explained that even with the passage of the

pending bill, it will still be necessary to enforce these new laws and he felt

that demonstrations would be necessary to insure this.

He expressed surprise that some Justice Department officials

and Senators had indicated they were no longer going to maintain the strong

positions they had taken on civil rights legislation just a few weeks ago and

that they now appeared ready to compromise and agree to "crippling proposals"

¡ being advanced by Senator Dirksen.

He said that if the Presidential election was held today, President

Johnson would carry the South with few exceptions. He said there is a definite danger

that the Republican Party will become the "white man's party" unless liberals

within that orgenization assert leadership.

He hedged on previous statements attributed to him that there would

be demonstrations in Washington if the civil rights bill appeared to be in trouble

and he admitted that no plans had been made for such demonstrations as of this

time.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. For information.

King mentioned the Director by name and, in substance,

put him in the category of southern politicians and racists

who are opposing the Bill of Rights. He indicated that the

Director, II nothing more, would be used by these people 10i

maintaining segregation, all because the Director made what

King regards as being a false statement charging communisi

infiltration and influence in the civil rights and negro

movement.

King challenged the Director that if he had auy real

evidence, to come forth with it.

He went on to say that the

Leaders of the Negro movement have tried consistently to

keep communists out of policy-forming areas and positions of

leadership.

King quoted the AG against the Director, to the effect

that it is to be expected that communists will try to infiltrate

civil rights movements, but they had not succeeded in making

the expected impact.

King, at the end, repeated his

challenge to the Director

to come forth with evidence to supporthis

charge.

infornation and all that flowed from it, he could not authorize

the Illing of a complaint charging the

subject with an attempt to

commit espionage. ONI was immediately advised both at San Diego

and at Washington concerning the identity of the subject and the

facts admitted by him. This was done in the event the Navy could

institute some action.

Upon completion of the signing of the

statements,

subject and his wife were permitted to return to their

residence

since no prosecutive action could

be taken.

ACTION:

The investigation at San Diego is continuing, the

completed results of which will be furnished to the Navy so it can

institute administrative proceedings against him.

The facts will,

likewise,

be furnished to the Internal Security Division of the

Department which has requested

them.

Reference is made to SSC lotter dated October &,

1975, requesting under iten tro, 'Aceess to the lists of

government employees and San Francisco security and Security

Index subjects whose names tere on the watch lists employed

in the CHIPROP SURVEY and the CHICLET SURVEX.

These categories

are described in a memorandum from sAC, Son Francisco, to

Director, IBI, dated Hurch 11, 1950.'

The warch 11, 1960,

memorandun was previously made available to the sSc.

FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) files do not contain

any information and/or documents responsive to referenced

request.

The San Francisco Office of the FBI has, thorefore,

been gueried in this regard and has advised as follows:

A revior of San Francisco files fails to disclose

any ratch lists wich my have been utilized in connection

with the CHIPROP and CHICLET SUNVEYS.

Agent personnel who

participated in these surveys have advised that no ratch lists

were maintained for these programs.

The limitations involved

in reviewing over 13,000 letters a day within a tro-hour period

did not allow sufficient time to compare these letters vith a

Agent porsonnel reviering these letters had

their orn 'mental lists' of names which included individuals tho

in the past, under general categories, vere known as persons of

internal security interest to the Bureau.

The

general

criteria used by Agent personnel reviering

letters under the CHICLET and CHIPROP SURYLYS included:

Letters with a return address of individuals tho

vere known to be 'turncoats' fron the Korean conflict.

Letters vith a return address of a doctor or a

university on Mainland China.

With regard to the 140 classification (Security of

lotter to Diroctor, FBl, dated Harch 11, 1160), no list of

novernment onployces was maintained. These cases were aponed

as a result of on indices search by the Division in which un

individual resided or an indicus scarch at IBIll, which was

initiated as a result of that individual coming to our uttontion

through these surveys based on the general criteria set forth

above.

Occasionally, when an indices search did not revoal an

Individual to bo a governont employce, subsequent background

invostigation vould dotermine this, at

which time an see

Agent porsonnol engaged in the reviewing of lottors

in connection with these surveys were experienced investigators

These Agents basically utilized thoir own esperience and judgonent

in these matters. While some Agonts my have utilizod porconal

UNITED STATES INEORMATION AGENCY (USIA)

FILM MARCH FOR FREEDOM"

1557%

chine

This morning I saw Jay Howe of our Subcommittee and he advised that

during the Attorney General"s appearance before the Subcommittee yesterday morning

no discussion arose involving the Bureau on the part of the members with respect to

the Director's testimony.

Bain panes

Howe did state, that all of the members are very concerned regarding the

background of Martin Luther King which the Director furnished off the record and

strictly among themselves to Jay's knowledge have had quite lengthy discussions

concerning it.

Jay Howe stated that yesterday morning after they had concluded hearings Z

on the Justice Department items, the members and the Chairman instructed him to

have the USIA show them the film which they have and propose to distribute the

captioned "March For Freedom." Howe stated all members were present for this film.

except Congressmen Lipscomb and Neal Smith. Howe stated the film generally deals

with the racial situation in this country and the members were particularly disturbed

and irked at the fact that Martin Luther King appears to predominate the film. He

appears in better than half of the entire film and after viewing it the members gotthe

impression that he had played an advisory role in its preparation.

Howe stated on a strictly confidential basis that the Chairman with the

concurrence of the other members of the Subcommittee feel that an approach should i.:

be made to the President so that he can instruct USIA to withdraw this film and not ?j..

permit its circulation. The Chairman also suggested to Howe he might want to mention

to tho Senate Appropriations Committee Clerk, Harold Merrick, that maybe members

of the Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations would want to view this film but definitely

without giving any of the King back ground which was furnished off the record.

Howe stated that yesterday afternoon after viewing the USIA movie members

had also observed the editorial in yesterday's Washington Post dealing with this picture

which in substance indicated it was a good film; however, it would meet with opposition

from certain areas particularly those who were "confused" or "fainthearted."

Hawe was most appreciative of the letter He received from the Director

after his appearançe before the Subcommittee.

The Attorney General called and stated that during the course of his

testimony yesterday on the Justice Department appropriation, he learned that

there had been previous testimony before the Committee concerning the sub-

versive affiliations of Martin Luther King. He said something was mentioned

about a report having been withdrawn and he asked whether this had anything to

do with the report he had discussed with the Bureau some time ago. He wanted

to know if there was anything on the record with regard to

such testimony.

After checking with Mr. Mohr, the Attorney General was infornded

that there was absolutely nothing on the record insofar as the Bureau was còn-

cerned in regard to this matter. It was pointed out that the House Subcommittee

I had been concerned about some film which USIA was going to distribute abroad,

in which Martin Luther King played a particular part, and because of this the

Director had been asked about King's background. The comments in this regard,

however, were off the record.

The Attorney General seemed completely satisfied with this, as he

said just to forget he ever asked about it.

(C) BRIEFS FILED WITH CIRCUIT COURTS OF APPEALS - REVIEW 0E, -=

At the present time the Bureau obtains through the washington Field

Office, copies of briefs filed with the united states supreme court

In all Bureau cases which go before that court on appeal. These

briefs are analyzed at the Seat of Government, not from a legal

viewpoint, but solely to assure that the Bureau's interests are

properly protected both from the standpoint that any false charges

against the Bureau or its personnel have been properly answered and

also to assure that the Bureau remains abreast of judicial decisions

and trends which affect or might possibly affect the Bureau's

operations.

In the future the review of briefs on appeal will be

extended to cover those filed with the various eircuit courts. of

Appeals. Accordingly, it will be the responsibility of the office

of prosecution to arrange to obtain copies of briefs filed by both

the appellant and the Government in every Bureau case in which a

conviction in the District Court is appealed to the appropriate

Circuit Court of Appeals.

Copies of the briefs should be furnished

to the Bureau together with a summary of the points raised on appeal

and the Government's answers thereto.

It should be borne in mind that the purpose of the review

• of these briefs is not to consider the legal sufficiency of the

arguments and answers, but solely to determine whether the Bureau's

interests have been properly and fully protected and to assure that

the Bureau is aware of issues raised

on appeal on the circuit Court

of Appeals level which affect or might possibly affect the Bureau's

operations.

This matter must be discussed at the next semiannual

conference in each office to insure that all investigative personnel

thoroughly understand the importance of these instructions and the

necessity for prompt compliance therewith.

(DY LYOUNG AMERICAN MEDAL AWARDS FOR BRAVERY, AND SERVICE --

Although there is no limitation on the number of

qualified

candidates who may be recommended by each of the Governors of the.

respective states and the Executive Officers of U. S. territories

and possessions, only a very small number of qualified candidates

were nominated last year for the Young American Medal Awards for

Bravery and Service which the President stands ready to personally

confer each year. Specifically, only eight qualified candidates

for the Service Award for 1957 were nominated for consideration.

It is seriously questioned that this small number of nominees is

representative of the outstanding work of American youth.

Attached are three copies of, a reprint entitled

"Young American Medal Awards for Service, Bravery" which appeared

in the January, 1957, issue of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin.

This reprint explains in detail the qualifications necessary for

nominees, the identity of persons who may submit nominations and

other pertinent matters regarding the awards.

The members of the

Young American Medals Committee are the same

as indicated in the

reprint with the exception of Mr. G. Frederick Mullen who has been

replaced by Mr. Luther Huston.

Additional copies of this reprint

may be obtained by routing slip marked "Attention: Crime Records

You should personally mention this matter to the Governor

Director Sec'y

My memoranda to you 10/16/75, and 10/21/75, (copies

attached) concerned a possible briefing by Bureau personnel of

Senators Church and Tower of the Senate Select Committee on U-

Intelligence Activities (SSC) and members of its Staff concerning

particularly sensitive aspects relating to our investigations

of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Stanley David Levison, and our

SOLO operation. Pursuant to the Director's suggestion, we had

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination of the Department, take up with the SSC the

possibility of having the SSC accept the account of Shaheen

that Shaheen had been briefed by the FBI "and believes -."

We are now in receipt of Shaheen's letter of 10/28175,

forwarding an SSC letter of 10/22/75, (both attached). The

SSC finds the Director's suggestion as not satisfactory

"because of the complexity of the issues involved." The SSC

notes its full confidence in Shaheen's objectivity, but does

not believe that Shaheen has had the opportunity afforded

members of the Committee Staff to study the entire matter in

sufficient detail to ask the questions necessary to explore

the issues fully. The SSC desires Shaheen to proceed with

further discussions so as to reach a satisfactory resolution

of the matter.

Shaheen, in turn, recommends a briefing by

Bureau personnel of Senators Church and Tower, Staff Director

Miller and Staff Members Gitenstein and Epstein, all of the

SSC Staff.

OBSERVATIONS:

our information to lower Staff levels. We would still like

to keep this at a higher level within the SSC than

represented by Messrs. Gitenstein and Epstein. However,

inasmuch as Gitenstein heads up the overall SCC inquiry into

the FBI and Epstein headsuup its specific inquiry into the

King case, we are unable to pose any objection to their being

present at the briefing, which objection would likely be

accepted by the SSC. We are, therefore, recommending acceding

to the SSC request.

RECOMMENDATION:

Upon approval, we will advise Shaheen that Bureau

personnel are available

for the briefing of the SSC people.

As indicated in our 10/16/75, memorandum, those personnel

will be you, Mr. Wannall (if available),

by Section Chief Williem 0. Gregar of the Senstudy Project

Steinbeck, furnish a briefing to Senate Select Committee

(SSC) officials to demonstrate the significance of infor-

mation we obtained from our S0:0 informants relative to the

influence that Stanley David Levison, secret Communist Party

member, had on Martin luther King, Jr.

In considering this recomendation, the Director

asked, 'Why don't we see if they will accept

the account of

Mr. Shaheen that he has been briefed and believes..."

On the arternoon of 10/21/75, Mr. Shaheen was

telephonically advised of the Director's observations anc

was requested to determine whether the SSC would accept

Mr. Shaheen's certification that he has been briefed and

belleves that the three documents in question could not le

furnished to the Committee in unexcised form without possibly

jeopardizing the very lives of sensitive FBI informants.

Mx. Shaheen agreed that it would be worth contacting

Mx, John I. Elliff, Domestic Intelligence lask Force Director

of the SSC, to determine If Shaheen's certification that

the excisions were proper and justified would satisfy the

SSC. Shaheen indicated that, following his contact with

Elliff, he would telephonically advise Cregar as to what,

If any, further action is desired of the Bureau.

This memorandum recommends that representatives

of the Intelligence Division brief Senators Church and Tower,

as well as William Miller, Staff Director, and John I. Illiff,

Domestic Intelligence Task Force Director, all of the

Senete Select Committee (SSC), regerding the background,

position in the Communist Party and the level of influence

our SOLO informants enjoy both in the Conmunist Party, USA,

and with Soviet officials. The purpose of this briefing is

to demonstrate the significance of the information we obtained

from these informants relative to the influence that Stanley

David Levison, secret Communist Party member, had on

Martin Luther

King, Jx.

By letter dated 9/16/75, Mx. John I. Elliff of the

SSC requested Mr. Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel

{ox Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney

General, give his personal attention to the excised portions

of three Bureau communications furnished to the SSC regarding

Martin Luther King, Jr. According to Elliff, the SSC

believes that the three documents in question should be

furnished to the Committee in unexcised form in order that

the Committee have a complete understanding of the King

investigation.

Inasmuch as representatives of the Intelligence

Division have insisted that providing the requested Bureau

documents in unexcised form could jeopardize the very lives

of sensitive FBI informants, Elliff in referenced letter

requested Shaheen to personally examine the three documents

in question and hopefully make a determination that the

documents in unexcised form could be provided the SSC.

Memorandum to Ms. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

In an effort to resolve this impasse, Mi. Michael

Shaheen and his deputy, Steven Blackhurst, were briefed in

detail as to the background, Party affiliation and level of

intluence our SOLD informants have both on the Soviets and

in the Conmunist Party.

They were not given the names of

our SOLO informants.

Additionally, Shaheen and Blackhurst

were allowed to review in detail the unexcised documents

requested by the SSC. Both agreed that the Bureau's position

was sound and that to produce the documents in unexcised

form fox the edification of the entire SSC Staff could,

in fact, seriously jeopardize the lives of our two informants.

As a result, Shaheen recomneided that officials of the FBI

brief Messrs. Church, Towes, Miller and Elliff in the same

manner that he and Blackhurst had been briefed. Additionally,

Shaheen suggested that the documents in question in unexcised

form be shown these SSC officials and that representatives

of the Intelligence Division be available to answer any

questions the SSC officials might have. It was Shaheen's

hope and belief that such a course of action would satisfy

the SSC as to the level of influence levison would have had

on the late Martin Luther King, Jx., and yet preserve the

security of our SOLO informants. Those representatives in

the Intelligence Division responsible for the SOLO informants,

as well as those who were responsible for the investigation

Of Martin Luther King, JI., believe Shaheen's proposal has

merit and recommend such a course of action.

RECOMMENDATION:

DATE 10-17-00:

The Select Committee has been advised of the

suggestion communicated by you yesterday, that the

Committee accept your examination of certain sensitive

materials relating to the Martin Luther King matter as

satisfying the Committee's request in this area.

This suggestion is not satisfactory because

of the complexity of the issues involved. 'While we have

full confidence in your objectivity, we do not believe

that you have had the opportunity afforded members of

the Committee staff to study the entire matter in suffi-

cient detail to ask the questions necessary to explore

the issues fully.

We hope you will proceed with further discussions

so as to reach a satisfactory resolution of this matter.

INTERVIEW OF

SPECIAL AGENT IN: CHARGE ROBERT C. "DENZ

NEW YORK OFFICE, SEPTEMBER 24, 1975,

BY MICHAEL EPSTEIN AND MARY DE OREO

The interview took place in Room G-308, Everett M.

Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D. C., from

approximately 11:10 a.m. to 11:45 a.m. on September 24, 1975.

Mr. Epstein presented

a one-page typewritten form, pertaining

to "Advice of Rights" and "Waiver of Rights", stating that he

hoped Mr. Denz would sign it.

It was read, signed and dated.

A copy was obtained by SAC Denz and is attached.

In response to career-type questions, SAC Denz

advised the interviewers of his current position in the New

York Office, which he assumed February, 1975, his position as

Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Portland, Oregon, Office

from April, 1974, to January, 1975, and his position of

Assistant Special Agent in Charge in the New York Office from

March, 1973 to April, 1974. Mr. Denz noted that prior to this

he was assigned to Headquarters. It was mentioned by Mr. Denz

that the New York Office nas five Special Agents in Charge and

one Assistant Director in Charge.

Mr. Epstein stated that he

is primarily interested in that point of Mr. Denz's career

which took place at Headquarters.

Mr. Denz advised that he

was transferred from the Detroit Office to Headquarters in

approximately March of 1963 and was assigned to a unit which

had some of the supervisory responsibilities pertaining to

the Conmunist Party, USA. After serving several months,

possibly six to eight, Mr. Denz was assigned to a unit handling

extremist matters, such as the Ku Klux Klan. As to the first

unit mentioned, it was explained that there

investigations and various subfiles concerning the Communist

Party, such as Communist Party membership, and Communist Party

youth.

Mr. Epstein asked the identities of the other individuals

serving in that specific unit.

Mr. Denz replied that he recalls

"Special Agents Larry Gurley, Seymor 'Phillips, 'and William Shaw.

In response to Mr. Epstein's question, Mr. Denz

ot months,

memory, Mr. Denz advised that he coordinated Communist Party

membership figures as furnished by certain field offices and

believed that

at one time he had assigned

the subfile on Negro

matters.

Mr. Epstein inquired whether this meant "Cominfil"

or Communist

Party infiltration of Negro groups.

Mr. Denz ••

advised that he could not recall

specifically the lineup in

Division 5, Headquarters, of Communist infiltration cases, but

the Communist Party, USA, Negro matters would probably touch

on Communist infiltration as well as Negro members in the Com-

munist Party itself. Mr. Epstein inquired as to the "March

on Washington" Of 1963 and specifically, the identity of the

Special Agent handling same, and who would an official of the

Division, as example, an Assistant Director, refer to if he had

a question regarding

• the March.

Mr. Denz advised that the

official would, no doubt, go down the line of command to the

Section Chief, and then to the Unit Chief, and then to the

Special Agent handling subject matter.

Mr. Epstein was aware

that a Mr. Baumgardner was

the Section Chief at that time.

AS

to whether the Assistant Director would go directly to the

Special Agent handling the matter, Mr. Denz advised that he

doubted such would be the normal procedure, but indicated that

an official could well have done so on occasion.

Mr. Epstein furnished for review Xerox copies of

a July and an August, 1963, memorandum, which indicated they

originated with Special Agent in Charge Denz, along with com-

munications directed to the Attorney General, pertaining to

Communist influence in racial matters and the March on Washing-

ton. A review of same indicated to Mr. Denz that such memoranda

went up the chain of command to Mr. Hoover. Mr. Denz advised

Re:

that the memoranda indicate that Mr. Denz had the responsibility

of coordinating field information regarding the March on Wash-

ington and the responsibility of keeping Bureau officials

currently advised.

Both memoranda were of an informative

nature. In reply to Mr. Epsteing questions regarding 'à review*

of files at Headquarters, Mr. Denz explained that probably the

memoranda were based on information furnished by several field

offices, but no doubt files at Headquarters could also have

been reviewed. Mr. Epstein inquired as to Mr. Denz's opinion

of the extent of Communist Party influence on

the March on

Washington. Mr. Denz noted that Mr. Hoover had commented on

one of the memoranda to the effect that it was an infinitesimal

amount. Mr. Denz stated that he, himself, might not put it in

exactly that manner but agreed, while it was no doubt a logical

target for the Communist Party, there was not that much 'in-

fluence. At least one of the memoranda supported this comment.

As to Mr. Epstein's question concerning Special Agent Forsyth's :

assignments,

he was advised by Mir. Denz that to the best of

memory Special Agent Forsyth handled assignments pertaining

to individual subjects but no specifics were known.

Mr.

Epstein inquired as to Mr. Denz's knowledge of "taps" on

Martin Luther King.

Mr. Denz replied that he recalls hearing

of same while at Heaâquarters but cannot recall as to exact

time, place, or any other specific details.

Mr. Epstein concluded the interview, stating his

appreciation for the appearance.

IMDRIS

ALI INFOR'LATION COUTATHED

ICININ IS UNCLASSITIDD

DATE 10-17-00FYSR-2 ALmIE

The

Senate Select Committee has recently learned

of allegations that the Central Intelligence Agency is in

possession of information indicating that there are Soviet

agents on seven Senators' staffs.

It has also been alleged

that this information was given to the Rockefeller Commission

but was subsequently deleted from its report.

Several weeks ago you briefed Mr. William G. Miller,

staff director of the Select Committee,

and myself on this

matter.

Furthermore, I am advised that Director Kelley

addressed this question recently at a public meeting spon

sored by the American Conservative Union.

In view of the Committee's interest in this area,

I am requesting that you provide to the Committee a brief

written statement of the FBI's position regarding these alle-

gations which may be made public by the Committee.

MoreovEr,

the Committee desires to have the substance of the briefing

referred to above in the form of a written memorandum for its

own confidential considerat 104.

Thank you for your assistance.

This memorandum recommends that representatives

of the Intelligence Division brief Senators Church and Tower,

as well as William Miller, Staff Director, and John I. Elliff,

Domestic Intelligence Task Force Director, all of the

Senate Select Committee (SSC), regarding the background,

position in the Communist Party and the level of influence

our SOLO informants enjoy both in the Communist Party, USA,

and with Soviet officials. The purpose of this briefing is

to demonstrate the significance of the information we obtained

from these informants relative to the influence that Stanley

David Levison, secret Communist Party member, had on

Martin Iuther King, JI. X(v)

By letter dated 9/16/75, Mr. John I. Elliff of the

SSC requested Mr. Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel

for Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney

General, give his personal attention to the excised portions

of three Bureau communications furnished to the SSC regarding

Martin Luther King, JI. According to Elliff, the SSC

believes that the three documents in question should be

furnished to the Committee in unexcised form in order that

the Comnittee have a spigte understanding of the king

investigation. (ul

REE 62-114385-101013

Inasmuch as representatives of the Intelligence

Division have insisted that providing the requested Bureau

documents in unexcised form could jeopardize the very lives

of sensitive FBI informants, Elliff in referenced letter

requested Shaheen to personally examine the three documents

in question and hopefully make a determination that the

documents in unexcised foll could be provided the ssc. (u)

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re :

Senstudy 75

62-116395

In an effort to resolve this impasse, Mr. Michael

Shaheen and his deputy, Steven Blackhurst, were briefed in

detail as to the background, Party affiliation and level of

influence our SOLO informants have both on the Soviets and

in the Communist Party.

They were not given the names of •

our SOLO informants. Additionally, Shaheen and Blackhurst

were allowed to review in detail the unexcised documents

requested by the SSc..

Both agreed that the Bureau's position

was sound and that to produce the documents in unexcised

form for the edification of the entire SSC Staff could,

in fact, seriously jeopardize the lives of our two informants.

As a result, Shaheen recommended that officials of the FBI

brief Messrs. Church, Tower, Miller and Elliff in the same

manner that he and Blackhurst had been briefed. Additionally,

Shaheen suggested that the documents in question in unexcised

form be shown these SSC officials and that representatives

ot the Intelligence Division be available to answer any

questions the SSC officials might have. It was Shaheen's

hope and belief that such a course of action would satisfy

the SSC as to the level of influence Levison would have had

on the late Martin Luther King, Jr., and yet preserve the

security of our SOLO informants. Those representatives in

the Intelligence Division responsible for the SOLO informants,

as well as those who were responsible for the investigation

of Martin Luther King, Jr.," believe Shaheen's proposal has

merit and recommend such a course of action. pu

RECOMMENDATION:

That Mr. Wannall, if available, accompanied by

Section Chief William O. Cregar of the Senstudy Project and

Memorandum W. 0. Cregar to Mr. W. R. Wannall,

dated 10/16/75, recommended that Mr. Wannall, accompanied

by Section Chief William O. Cregar of the Senstudy Project

and Messrs. David Ryan, Seymor F. Phillips and Michael J.

Steinbeck, furnish a briefing to Senate Select Committee

(SSC) officials to demonstrate the significance of infor-

mation we obtained from our SOLO informants relative to the

influence that Stanley David Levison, secret Communist Party

member, had on Martin Luther King, JI.

In considering this recommendation, the Director

asked, "Why don't we see if they will accept the account of

Mr. Shaheen that he has been briefed and believes-."

On the afternoon of 10/21/75, Mr. Shaheen was

telephonically advised of the Director's observations anc

was requested to determine whether the SSC would accept

Mr. Shaheen's certification that he has been briefed and

believes that the three documents in question could not be

furnished to the Committee in unexcised form without possibly

jeopardizing the very lives of sensitive FBI informants.

Mx. Shaheen agreed that it would be worth contacting

Mr. John I. Elliff, Domestic Intelligence Task Force Director

of the SSC, to determine if Shaheen's certification that

the excisions were proper and justified would satisfy the

SSC. Shaheen indicated that, following his contact with

lif any, further action is desired of,

of mail which would be of interest to the FBI in discharging

its responsibility of protecting the security of the United

States The selection was made based on the person or persons

to whom the mail was addressed and/or the identity of the

person in Communist China who originated the mail

The selected items of mail were opened, photographed

and thereafter replaced into the routine mail flow.

Photographic

copies were furnished to the Bureau for transliteration and

review.

The transliterations were then furnished San Francisco

for further dissemination,

SAC Ruehl advised during the period CHIPROP was

in operation, Conmunist China was considered a hostile force.

There were a

number of Chinese in the United States who had

received highly technical and scientific training and education

and a number of them were employed in defense areas.

Communist

China was endeavoring to induce such individuals to return to

Communist China, particularly to assist in nuclear research and

the development of sophisticated weapons and missiles.

Some

Chinese scientists did in fact return to Communist China after

having been employed in areas concerned with defense of the

United States.

There was at least one instance SAC Ruehl

recalled where a Chinese scientist attempted to depart the U. S.

en route to Communist China by way of England while in possession

of classified information. The classified information was dis

covered and removed from his custody at a lase port of embarkation.

Through

the CHIPROP operation, overtures

being made to Chinese in

the United States to assist Communist China were discovered.

While CHIPROP was In operation, another program

involving Chinese letters emanating from the United States and

destined for Communist China was in operation under the acronym

CHICLET®

CHICLET was initially motivated when it was determined

registered mail from the United

States was being delivered to a

Communist intelligence department officer listed as the Military

Attache at the Chinese Communist Embassy in Stockholm, Sweden.

CHICLET resulted in information concerning individuals in the

United states, obviously sympathetic to Communist China, ano

who might logically present an intelligence problen for

the FBIe

A third project regarding Chinese language letters

emanating from Canada and destined to individuals in the United

Items in support of its recommendation for the program. A

review of the items at FBIHQ established such a program would

have little value and authorization for San Francisco to

At the conclusion of the interview, Mr. Dick

posed the question as to whether SAC Ruehl ever considered the

publicly and asked for my views.

I discussed this matter with Mir. Adams and Mr. Wannall

available to Senator Mansfield, but that the enclosure not be further

Berley did submit to interview, the results of which

were voluntarily furnished by Berley and are as follows:

Carroll Arms

were SSC Staff Members

John I. Elliff and

James Dick.

At the outset, Berley was furnished an "Advice of

Rights" statement to sign.

Berley questioned the need to sign

such a statement in view of the fact that he was appearing

voluntarily and merely desired to "set the record straight"

regarding his activities. Mr. Dick stated that it he, Berley,

did not sign it, the interview would be terminated.

personal retention.

Berley told his interviewers that he had already

tolked with IDI personnel John Hotis and Paul Daly, and

understood from them that his responses to questions would be

limited to the subject of surreptitious entries and that the

release from his FDI confidentiality agreement was for only that

subject matter and for nothing else.

Berley also told Elliff

and Dick that Hotis and Daly had advised that certain matters

regarding surroptitious entries were under revier by the

Department of Justice. Consequently, answers to certain questions

at this time might not be appropriate, in view of the Department

Berley also told interviewers that there were four

privileged areas concerning which he understood he would not

se required to answer questions.

These concerned matters which

might identify FBI sources, divulge sensitive methods or

techniques, affect ongoing investigations, and information

obtained fron or involving a third agency.

U. S. Senate Select Comnittee

to Study Governmental Operations

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

George A. Berley by SSC Staff Members

Berley inquired as to the definition of "intelligence

targets" and Ellift responded that this meant foreign power.

and anything defined as dangerous to the national security.

Berley asked Mr. Ellift if such definition included organiza-

tions advocating

overthrow of the Government by force and

violence.

Mr. Elliff said that this area had not as yet been

defined,

Thereupon, Berley said that he would decline to

answer any questions concerning such organizations.

On request, Berley furnished information relating to

his background in the FBI which covered 33% years. He said

that during his career he had spent only about 20% of his work

time in the area of locks and locking devices.

Berley told Ellitt and Dick that all surreptitious

entries in which he engaged were with the authority of

Hoover, the Assistant Dixector of the Intelligence Division

and the Assistant Director of the Laboratory. He emphasized

that he never acted on his own authority and

such operations

always were in regard to current operations in which case files

had been opened.

On request, Berley furnished information concerning

the organizational structure of the FBI Laboratory.

Almost an hour and

interview on the subject of "lock training.

one-half was spent during the

Matters covered

concerned the training of Berley; and schools which Berley

conducted, including the training of new Agents and specialized

schools.

He pointed out that mo"t of the latter were added on

to regular In-Service Training.

He was asked whether lock schools

were connected with schools relating to electronic surveillances

and replied that he considered the question outside the parameters

of the interview.

Berley was asked if he knew how the students

he taught would use the information and he replied "No," insofar

as specific cases were concerned.

He pointed out that such

training also related to the security of FBI facilities.

Re:

Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

George A. Berley by SSC Staff Members

Berley informed that he did not set up the classes

and when asked whether they were in conjunction with other

courses, he again declined to answer on the basis that question

went beyond the parameters of the interview.

Considerable time was spent on a discussion of the

auchority fox operations in which Berley engaged.

He advised

that at no time did he personally authorize any activity in which

he was involved and that the authority always came from his own

Assistant Director (AD) or higher superiors.

As a matter of

fact, according to Berley, the order to him to participate in

these activities was, in most cases, approved by the FBI Director

himself.

Berley was

questioned concerning the form of the authority

and pointed out that there would be a teletype from a field

office in connection with an ongoing investigation and that

the teletype would later have the authority endorsed thereon or

seen enticed that att

there would be a memorandum authorizing the operation. Berley

again emphasized that all of his activities concerned ongoing

investigations.

He was asked if there was a code name for a

surreptitious entry and he responded in the negative.

Asked if

he ever had notice of an anticipated project in advance of

receiving a teletype, Berley responded "Yes."

Berley was asked

what information he liked to receive in advance for purposes

of any preliminary discussion concerning a job.

He responded

that this question was outside the

ts to was question the suted the ramate of the interview

Asked how many operations in which he participated

per year, Berley said he had no idea.

He was asked for an

approximation of the number of operations per year and gave a

round figure of three or four; on the average but indicated that

he did not know the exact number.

Berley was next told that

from the period April 1, 1964, to April 1, 1965, he had received

nine incentive awards in connection with his work..

Berley

responded that he had not reviewed any records that would permit

him to verify this figure.

Berley was asked if he did other things than just

He responded that his prime responsibility

was safes and locks.

He was asked if he ever took anything ou

Berley was asked whether any of the jobs concerned

terms as evidenced by the exchange he had had earlier in the

interview.

012 November 1, 1961, when Selyn McCollum watched

¡police order nine young Negroes out of the white

ting room at the Trailways Bus Terminal, and this

reported to the F.B.I., there was no apparent result.

¡November 22, when five students were arrested for

said he assured the Attorney General that law and

order could be preserved without federal aid. Also

that day, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of

the Civil Rights Division talked with Albany Movement

leader W. G. Anderson. On Friday, with demonstrations.

and negotiations in progress, he phoned Mayor Kelley

and offered to mediate,, and the mayor assured the

Assistant Attorney General that the city could work

evening, hundreds more

wired Vice President Jöhnson and Attorney, General

Kennedy to protest the arrests. F.B.I. men were re-

ported gruising the streets in cars.

• On Monday, December 18, a settlement was announced:

and within a hour Mayor Kelley said Attorney General

Robert Kennedy called to congraculate him for a good

job.

Events in Albany were caused by the city's violation

of the Interstate Commerce Commission's regulation. The

Federal Government took no apparent action to curb that

violation, although it undoubtedly has power to enforce

its own orders. ,Today in Albany the I.C.C. order is

being complied with.: It was enforced, not by federal

authority, but by demonstrations in the streets.

Conclusion

Over 700 Negroes in Albany, and a few sympathetic

whites, spent time in prison in December of 1961, as a..

mass substitute for federal action to compel recognition

of a legal right. They were not opposed by the white

people of Albany, but by local law enforcement officers.

These officers acted, not out of malice, but out of a.?

too-faint comprehension of the changes which are roll-

ing slowly, but inevitably, "through the South today;

and which, with McCotb, Jackson, and Albany, have be-

gun to move into the heart of the Black Belt. As in

other cases, a movement born of specific grievances

was nurtured in crisis and developed larger objectives,

those of full equality and untarnished human 'dignity.

The real feelings of the Negro community were kept

from a fundamentally fair-minded white community by

the powerful barrier of segregation, propped up. by

a hostile press and an unsympathetic city administration.

As Christmas approached in 1951, masses of Albany Negroes

Where Was the Federal

Over 700 Negroes in Ahany, and a few sumpathetic

whiles, spent time in prison i December of 1901, as a mass

substitute for faileral action to compel recognition of a

legal right.

nice the re uglie in hary, the

is the onlv one those actions do not match its expressedi

their capacity to endure pain and rebuff. The white community

has behaved in accord with the customs of the majority of southern

whites in resisting attempts to change the status quo. The chief of

police has acted like i chiet of police. But the tederal government

has not operated according to its pretensions.

The national government has failed to protect the libertics of

its citizens in the city of Albimy. From the feebleness of its actions,

a detached observer might conclude that the federal government

is still operating under the Constitution of the United States as once

expounded by Chief Justice. Taft.

The First Amendment of the constitution of the United States

says: "Congress shall make no law : .

abridging the freedom of

speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to is-

semble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

Supreme. Court decisions in the carly part of this century made it

clear beyond question that these rights of free speech, petition, and

assembly, are also guaranteed against state or local action by the

most miserable jails in the country for peacefully attempting to

petition the government for a redress of grievances. Is the national

government powerless to protect the right of petition?

Section 242 of the U.S. Criminal Code. which comes from the

Civil Rights Act of 1S66 and the Enforcement Act of 1S70, creates

a legal basis for federal prosccution of: "Whoever, under color of

any law ... wilfully subjects ..! any inhabitant of any State ... to

the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or

protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.

police of the city of Albany, by arresting

Negroes and whites in

connection with their use of the terminal facilities in that city,

violated il right which has been made clear beyond a shadow

of a doubt in the courts, and nailed down tight by i ruling of the

Interstate Commerce Commission. Yet, the federal government took

no action.

When a sheriff, in the presence of witnesses, slapped a young

Negro for asking the right to sing ant pray in prison, the federal

government was silent. Throughout the December troublts, there

were phone calls from the Justice Department to Govemor Vandiver

and Mayor Kelley, conversations between the Department and leaders

of the Albany Movement. The F.B.I. dutifully sat in its office in

Albany and took dozens upon dozens of affidavits from Negro citizens

complaining that then consaintional rights had been violated by city

and county sificials. But eight months later, chere was not a gp

of action on these charges. me

In the spring and summer of 1962, hundreds of Negroes, and

somal lites, were again deprived of their constitutional rights by

it an, county officials. They were put into jail again and agin

or taking actions supposedly protected by the First and l'ourtechti

Amendments.

A pregnant woman was beaten, & lassyer was

caned,

a white youth had his jaw and ribs broken, three young people were

forcibly dragued from a courtroom under the eyes of a county judge.

Still no action. Eighteen-ycar-ole Cordell Reagan, a veteran

worker, emerged from Dougherty County, jail in late August, after

16 days of confinement for contributing to the delinguency of a

minor" (which, translated, meant that leagan had been sitting on

the fender of i nearby car, while to students were picketing a

theater) made this comment to me about the Department of Justice

¿ 1 local police: "They're letting them get away with murder."

. In December 1961, in the micst of hundreck of juilings in the.

A gany demonstrations, the New York Times reported from Albany:

"he Justice Department was watching desclopments here closely

1 September 1962, after shotgun blasts ripped into a home in Terrell

county where Negro and white registration workers were staying,

a Justice Department spokesman said in Washington: "I'e are sate)-

ing the situation very, very closely:"

-ICC mling, thie Atlanta Journal's Washington correspondent report-

redi The U.S. Justice Department his lunched an investigation of

allegert buse station segregation in

Abany:" In July, several Justice

Departinent lawyers were sent to Albany. On the 26th of that month,

according to an Atlanta Constilulio report. Ahany's Mayor Kelley

conferred in Washington with Attomey Goncral Kennedy. The Con-

stitution said: "Kelley said he told Kennedy that Albany's racial

problems are dealt with by local people. Kelley said Kennedy agreed

with him.

Atlanta Journal Washington correspondent Douglas Kiker report-

ed in July: "Justice Department officials described the Albany trouble

Monday as a tense situation but added that Mayor Asa Kelley and

Chief of Police Lauric Pritchett have certainly inclicated it strong

desire to maintain order. They said they had received no evidence

that Albany police ae not furnishing adequate law protection." This

was iminedliately after attorney C. B. King. with more than 100 city

and county police nearby, had reccived his bloody beating at the

hánds of the Dougherty County sheriff. Kiker disclosed that the De-

partment of Justice was "investigating" the beating of King. But if

there, was ever a case where one. hour of investigation would be

• sufticient to establish grounds for rederal action, this was it.

Near the end of the summer, after receiving dozens of angry

telegrams, after the picketing of the White Flouse by citizens from

both North and South, and after face-to-face pleas from Roy Wilkins

of the NAACP and William Kunstler of the American Civil Liberties

Union, the Justice Departinent made two legal moves: 1) it entered •

a friend-of-the-court brief to support the Albany Morement's request

that an injunction against further. demonstrations be denied; and

2) it asked for an injunction (after a violation of voting rights in

Terrell Cointy so outrageous that usually calm reporters on the

scene were upset) to prevent certain officials in southeast Georgia

from interfering with registration activities.

The available administrative machinery for enforcing federal

law should be outined: the Department of Justice has the duty to

entorce laws-passed by Congress and piovisions of the U.S. Con-

stitution. In the Department there is a Civil Rights Division, headed

by an Assistant Attorney General, which hanciles the bull of the legal

work of the Department dealing with divil rights cases. The Division

depends for its information on another branch of the Justice Depart-

ment, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has offices in cities

all over the country. F.B.I. agents undertake investigations on orders

from the Department, to determine if federal law has been violated.

The F.B.I. can make arrests, usually on orders. from the Department,

sometimes on its own in situations of urgency. After investigation,

in eivil rights cases, it is up to the Civil Rights Division to decide

whether prosecution should he initiated. If so, this is usually done

through the United States Attorney in that judicial district, who

prosecutes the case in federal District Court, after indictment by a

grand jury or the filing of an information. Also upon the Depart-

ment's advice or order, the U.S. Attorney may file civil suits (al-

though this may be done by a Civil Rights Division lawyer from

Washington) asking that the federal court issue injunctions forbid-

ding certain parties to engage, in specified practices which may de-

prive individuals of their, rights under the Constitution. Attached

to the federal district court are U.S. marshals, who serve subpoenas,

give notice of injunctive action, and otherwise carry out the orders

of the court or the Attorney General. From District Court, there is

cases, to. the- United States Supremic Court.

he Department of Justice has on occasion defended its restrain!

o the Albany situation and in other crises be the following argu

ments, which deserve examination and reply:

1.

Argument:

Prosecutions in the Deep

South stand little

chance of succeeding, since juries are shite and

prejudiced.

Reply:

Even if acquittal results, prosecution may act

as a deterrent. Right now, southern police of

ficers, knowing the government's reluctance to

prosecute, feel free to do as they wish with

Negro citizens, and Albany has demonstrated

this. If nothing else, it series of prosecutions

would exert a powerful educational and moral

force in i situation where Negroes feel deserted

by the national govorment and southern whites

•are not clear where the government stands.

2. Argument:

of 1015 interpreted section 242 in such a way

3. Argument:

The onlyaay to get new interpretations of the

law is to bring new cases before the courts.

The. Department of Justice needs specific leg-

islative authorization from Congress-as it his

in the. Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 re-

garding voting-to take injunctive action against

local officials in other situations involving civil

rights and civil liberties.

Reply:

In the Dels case of 1S95 there was no specific

legislative basis for an injunction; yet the Su-

could get one, saving: "Every government...

Albany has implications for

American freedom beyond the question of cqual

rights for Negroes. Can American citizens, any-

Our federal arrangement requires that the na-

tional government should interfere as little is

possible with "local" situations.

Reply:

•It was precisely the purpose of the Fourteenth

Amendment to take the enforcemont of racial

equality out of the hands of local governments,

which had proved the most flagrant violators,

and put ultimate authority in the hands of the

national government. Local governments mily

do anything they want in the tiel of ordinary

crime. They may punish people for disorderlv

conduct, for blocking sidlewalks.. for discheying

police officers. But the moment such offenses

There is i considerable amount of distrust among Albany Negroes

for local members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

justice, sho diffidently write down complaints and do no more.

With all the clear violations by local police of constitutionil rights,

with undisputed evidence of beatings by sheriffs and deputy sheriffs,

the F.B.I. has not made it single arrest on behalf of Negro citizens.

The one arrest macle by the F.B.l. in connection with the Albany

situation came in early September, and this when in

F.B.I. man-

himself. was attacked by i shite man near the site of a burned

church.

In its 1961 volume. Justice, the Commission on Civil Rights im-

plice that the F.B.l. may be fundamentally incapable of enforcing

the civil rights of American citizens. This is because of its natura

attachments to local police on whom it is dependent for the solution

of ordinary crimes, and because it is these same local police tho

are the most frequent violators of the rights of Negroes in the South.

- The Commission suggested the possibility of "a new alministrative

arrangement within the Department of Justice to case the problem

ot f.B.l: agents having to investigate police officers with whom they

work daily on other cases.

One solution might be the creation of a special corps of federal

agents-similar to the T-mon used by the Trous Department-fo

the sole purpose of enforcing foleralk guaranteed constitutional right

in many parts of the country where they are consistently violated.

Such agents need not he "outsiders." for there is a whole new genera-

tion of young Southerners-Neere and shite-who are intelligent,

courageous, capable, and genninely concerned about civil rights, and

from whom such agents could he selected. The F.B.I. is most ef-

fective as an agency for the solution of ordinary crimes, and perhaps

it should stick to that.

Is for the President of the Onited States, He could play, but so

ar has not planed, i ker role in crises such as Alband. The Commis

sion on Civil Rights last sear called for the exertion of leadership

by the Presicent and others in the National Government.... These

recommendations a basee on the belief that the Presidency, and

indeed the whole Federal establishment, is preeminently a place for,

moral leadership. The Commission has been impressed with the in-

Quence which those in responsible positions can esert on the civil

rights climate of the Sation By using the instruments for education

and persuasion which are arailable to them they can stir the conscience

of the counitry."

President Kenneely's first substantive public statement came after

eight months of trouble in Albany when, responding to a question

HIH

55285 DocId: 32989677 Page 301

+3AM5HEN3N40:92,

## Page 302

at his August 1, 1961, press conference, he called the situation "un-

satisfactory,

declared he could not anderstand why Albany city

officials woukd not negotiate with Negroes, and said: "Te are going

to attempt is me have in the.

past to try to provice i satistactory

solution for the protection of the constitutional rights of the people

of Albany, and

ive will continue.t

do so."

The

trouble with this

latter statement was that "in the past" the national goverment had

done extremely little, and if its future ittempts were to be of the

same magnitude, this was a puny promise indeed.

In another press conference on Thursday, September 14, 1962,

• again in response to it question. President Kennedy strongly de-

nounced the burning of the Negro churches in Lee and

Terrell

Counties, calling the actions "cowardly as well as outrageous." This

was commendable. But it also indicates the level of tolerance at

which our national leaders-and perhaps most white Americans-

operate. They will be aroused by open violence, particularly against

places of worship. (Govemor Vandiver of Georgia, hardly a friend

of the Albany Alovement, offereda $250 reward for the apprehension

of the arsonists). But they will not be made sufficiently indignant

by mass julirags. by the deprivation of free speech and assembly,

"by beatings and intimication, ly the perpetuation of segregation.

The nation as a whole-not only the President-needs to espand its

capacity for outrage.

• Only once in the Albany troubles diel the national administration

show a real burst of energy; that was when Martin Luther King, Jr.

was jailee on July 10. The President asked for i report. the Attorner

General got busy, the Assistant Attorney Goneral in charge of civil

rights made phone calls, and the next day King was out of jail. But

there was no such deep concern for the hundreds of ordinary citizens

in Albany who went to jail about the same time for basically the

same reason. Special favors to distinguished individuals are too casy

a substitute for genuine assistance to troubled groups. Jackie Robin-

son, who last summer received elaborate greetings from the President

on the occasion of his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame, noted

the Albany situation and wrote: "I'd rather have freedom than

flower's."

• The President's general silence. (ercept for the two instances

noted above) and the frebleness with which the Justice Department

has acted are often attributed to the practical realities of national

politics, which require. it is said, that the President woo the support

of Southerners in Congress for other laudable national goals. But

there are some means so morally hurtful that they corrupt the ends.

Besides, there is serious reason to doubt that the Administration

gains substantial advantage from such tactics. The Senators from

the state of Georgia had an opportunity, in 1961, to vote on 12 key

issues important to the Administration: they both voted with the

Administration in only tiro of the 12 instances, and these were farm

bills that they probably would have supported in any event. In i

on the housing bill; Talmadge supported the. President

Finally, it can be argued that the President's concern for civil

rights and his concern for political advantage are both demonstrated

by his choice of federal judges, knowing clearly that those appointed

in the South will have tremendous authority over the progress of

race relations, and will have it for many years. Certain judicial ip-

pointments of this Administration have appalled Southern liberals.

The federal government, if it wants to, ean take the following

actions in Albany:

1.

Begin immediate prosecution under Section 242 of local

officials who have deprived Negroes of their constitutional rights in

the Albany area. Such trials, since they involve misdemeanors, do -

not even regaire grand jury indictments, but may be initiated on

the presentation of an information by the Department of Justice, and

the Commission on Civil Rights has urger this procedure "in appro-

onate cases.

lations of federal law; but the Justice Department has not acted.

2. Station in the area i substantial number of federal agents

to protect citizens from intimidation, beating, and false arrest. Such

agents should not confine themselves to standing by and taking notes,

which the F.B.I. has been doing on occasion in the Deep South in

the midst of scenes of brutality, but should have the authority to

make arrests on the spot.

3. Go into federal court and ask for injunctions to prevent

local officials from i) enforcing segregation statutes, and b) inter-

tering with peaceful assembly, picketing and speech. Violations of

such injunctions would then be subject to judicial punishment with-

out trial. Both such legal actions have been initiated by the Albany

Movement, but they could have been started by the federal govern-

ment last. December, and should now be hacked by it. The govern-

ment, after prodding, did enter a friend-pf-the-court brief in a de

fensive action against the city's attempt to make demonstrations

punishable, but has not taken any steps to make peaceful assembly

a positive right.

4. The President should address himself directly to the people

- of Albany, white and Negro, speaking forthrightly about racial dis-

crimination, making it plain to Albany whites that they are entitled

to express their views and hold their private beliefs, but that public

law now entitles Negroes to equal use of all public facilities, and

-that the entire power of the federal governinent will stand behind

this. The Southern Regional Council, in its report The Federal Exccu-

tive and Cicil Rights, said: "The South should be informed where

the President stands... The millions of Southerners, white and

Negro, who want to break loose from enfechling customs, would

respond with gratitude to Presidential leadership.

PAGE 33

## Page 304

5. There is a proceclare outlined in the C'S. Attorney's Manual,

Title 10, Civil Rights Division. which says that where there is in-

sufficient evidence for federal prosecution hut "repetitive civil rights

violations" exist, the U.S. Attornes mas initiate a mediative con-

ference "with resemsible local officials." The manual says: "Situations

in which such i conference may.he useful include those insolving

enforced racial scureration and illegal police practices

farther:

Such a conferents shouki seres the cure of pure the

officials on notice regarding the applicable federal laws and giving

them an opportunity to remedy the situation.." It would be difficult

indeed to think of a situation more badly in need of such a procedure

judges. Judgeships left vacant are preferable to those filled for life

by men who, on their public record, arcopponents of racial conalits.

7. The Commission on Civil Rights might well investigate the

Albany situation and mike appropriate recommendations. There are

a hundred potential Albany's in the Deep South.

These proposed actions require boldness, imugination, vigorous

initiative-preciscly those qualities that were promised hy Mr. Ken-

nedy in his campaign for the Presidency. As yot. however. no New

Frontiers have heen carved out in the social

wilderness which sur-

rounds Albany. They will probably he established, as elsewhere in

the Deep South, by determined Negroes and farsighted whites, com-

pelled by court rulings and smoothed by compromises, but with that

intermittent conflict, and suffering, which accompany progress. That

the goverment can do is help ease the pain..
