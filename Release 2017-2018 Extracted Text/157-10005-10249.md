Mr. Smothers. Mr. Secretary, we see there a series of

lettered subparagraphs setting out alternatives that the CIA

has offered up as potential areas to be pursued, and then

some handwritten notes opposite each paragraph apparently in-

dicating approval or disapproval of the proposed faction.

The Chairman. Is this memorandum a CIA memorandum?

Mr. Smothers. It is for the Chief of the Western Hemi-

sphere Division.

Senator Tower. But who signed off on it? That sig-

nature is obscured.

Mr. Smothers. The author of this working paper is

unknown. It appears to be -- we have an acting chief --

Mr. Dennin. The chief at that time was

a and

though it is not established, people have said that they

believed that it was Mr. Esterline who was the acting chief

at that date.

Mr. Smothers. Looking at that memorandum and coming

down to subparagraph C under paragraph 1 of the memorandum, we

see the statement:

"To what extent will the U.S. Government participate

in the overthrow of Trujillo".

And then in subparagraph C:

"Would: it provide a small number of sniper rifles

or other devices for the removal of key Trujillo people from

the scene?"

Mr. Schwarz. Now if I might put this document in

chronological context for the Committee, the persons in Santo

Domingo are at this point seeking permission to pass machine

guns to the dissidents who they know are seeking those machine

guns in order to assassinate Trujillo, and there is a block

put on this shipment -- rather, to

the passage of them; they

had already been shipped to the Dominican Republic -- and a

draft cable was prepared authorizing the passage and then it

was said, no, we've got to go check with State to determine

whether the machine guns should be passed.

And this memorandum reflects the checking with State, he

apparently came to see Mr. Berle..

Further, as a matter of information, therMoo

was referred to in here, did know that other assassination

weapons had been passed to the dissidents.

Now given that background, I will read the memorandum

into the record and I will have one question for the witness. (41

said he felt the same way."

Now, Mr. Secretary, in the way which your understanding was

of the expected degree of candor between CIA and the State

Department, would it be your expectation that if Mro

had known that other weapons had been passed to the same

dissidents and they had stated that they intended to use those

other weapons to assassinate Mr. Trujillo, that usa.

should have passed that information on to Mr. Berle?

Mr. Rusk. Under those circumstances, I would think the

answer is yes.

I mean, one thing I'm sure of, Mr. Schwarz, and that is

Mr. Berle did not write this memorandum on May 3rd, 1961 in

preparation for a Senate investigation in 1975.

Mr. Schwarz. You believe it to reflect accurately what

transpired?

Mr. Rusk. I have no doubt. It was sent to Mr. Coerr, Mr.

Owen, Mr. Devine, in the Department of State, and I've known

Mr. Berle for quite a long time and I would have predicted this

would have been his reaction.

Senator Mathias. Mr. Chairman, just at this point --

The Chairman. Senator Mathias.

Senator Mathias. It would be interesting to get the

Secretary's reflection that if that is the case, as Mr. Berle's

memorandum indicates and as the Secretary said, how do you in
