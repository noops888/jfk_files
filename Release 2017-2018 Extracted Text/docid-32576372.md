RE: LA COSA NOSTRA

EXTREMELY SURVEILLANCE CONSCIOUS. TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF PLAN

TO DEVELOP POSSIBLE NEW DATA ON MAKE-UP OF HERETOFORE UNKNOWN

COSA NOSTRA GROUPS AND TO MAINTAIN SECURITY OF SURVEILLANCE OF

DESIMONE, SUCH SURVEILLANCE BY. VARIOUS OFFICERS PARTICIPATING SHOULD

BE TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUED IF CONTINUANCE WOULD QUOTE BURN 'UNQUOTE

DESIMONE. ALL OFFICES HAVING SOURCES COVERING COMMISSION ACTIVITY,

AND PARTICULARLY THOSE REPORTING ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS PERTAINING

TO COMMISSION ACTION AGAINST BONANNO QUOTE FAMILY UNQUOTE ARE TO

MAINTAIN CONSTANT CONTACT

WITH KEY SOURCES TO ENLARGE ON OUR

KNOWLEDGE OF PLANS COMMISSION HAS TO CONVENE NEW. YORK CITY AREA

JANUARY TWENTYFIVE NEXT.

THISâ€¢ MATTER IS TO RECEIVE PRIORITY HANDLING AND BUREAU MUST

BE KEPT ADVISED OF ALL SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS.

NOTE: The above-mentioned LA informant who is a veteran member

of & Cosa Nostra has been told by the LA Family underboss Nick

Licata that Frank Desimone, the LA Family boss, and the leader

representing smaller Cosa Nostra groups in the Western parts of the

Us with the Commission, is to be in NYC on 1-25-65, to meet with

the commission.

This presumably will pertain to recent commission

action against the Joseph Bonanno Family and according to informant

may possibly pertain to the reorganization of this family which

is now under commission trusteeship.

Inasmuch as. Desimone will

be

expected to alert other Cosa Nostra leaders in the Western part

of the US representing smaller groups, some of whom may be relatively

unknown, it will be valuable to afford coverage to Desimone's

movements to and from NYC. Inasmuch as past experience with

Desimone has shown him to be extremely surveillance conscious,

and

has determined that he will avoid planned contacts if he is

aware of surveillance, extreme decratsoe must be used in covering

his movements.
