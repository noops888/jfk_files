JFK MICROFILM FILE SUMMARY

SUMMARY; REEL 4, FOLDER(S) 3, CREATED 02/07/94 by ES

SUBJECT OF FOLDER : Abram Chayes

201 NUMBER, IF ANY

INCLUSIVE DATES OF FILE MATERIAL Undated THRU APRIL 1978

RELEVANCE OR NON-RELEVANCE TO OSWALD & JFK ASSASSINATION:

Neither the information or time frame is relevant. See Summary below.

REASON OR ASSUMED REASON FOR INCLUSION IN THIS COLLECTION.

A review of the HSCA volumes did not surface an "Abram" Chayes but an "Abraham" Chayes, a legal

advisor to the State Department, who maintained that at the time Oswald received his visa to enter Russia

from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinik, normally at least 1 week would elapse between the time of a tourist's

application and the issuance of a vias. It would appear that Abram and Abraham are not identical to each

other. Betty Lichtenfeld of the HSCA reviewed the file on 17 August 1978.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION WITHIN FILE:

Harvard Law School professor who attended a Pugwash Conference in Munich in 1977.

CIA/U. S. GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP:

None.
