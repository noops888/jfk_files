DL 92-339

AT DALLAS, TEXAS

DL I-3 advised on May14, 1970, that JOE CAMPISI and

his brother,

SAM CAMPISI, have been known to him for many years.

JOE CAMPISI takes some betsatthe Egyptian Restaurant which he

runs. He primarily handles bets during the football season.

JOE and SAM also arrange big dice games, some of which he (DL T-3)

has attended.

These games are made up mostly of Jewish gamblers.

DL T-3 caught JOE CAMPISI trying to cheat in one of these games

about a year ago and they had

some harsh words.

Since that time

they have been cordial in their meetings but he does not trust

the CAMPISIs in any gambling game. DL T-3 was asked if he

believed CAMPISI, or anyone with outside hoodlum support could

organize and control the bookmakers and gambling in Dallas.

He replied that in his opinion this would be virtually impossible.

He said the bookies in Dallas are independent operators and have

been for many years.

He does not see how anyone, no matter what

his financial backing or hoodlum connections, could control

more than a few of the bookies in this area.

One reason for

this is the fact that only a few of the bookmakers in this area

are Italian.

Those who are not Italian would not be impressed

or intimidated by Italian hoodlums such as CARLOS MARCELLO.

He

said that asfar as he knows there is no La Cosa Nostra organization

in Dallas at this time.

DL T-4 advised on June 2, 1970, that he has visited

CAMPISI's Egyptian Restaurant from time to time recently and

although he has not been able to establish that any booking

is going on in the restaurant he has learned that JOE CAMPISI

has been getting some hot tips on some horse races and has been

betting all he can get down on them. CORKY CAMPISI, SAM

CAMPISI's son won $1,700 on the Kentucky Derby. CORKY is both

betting and booking.

CHARLIE MC NATT recently placed a $3,650 bet on a

horse with JOE CAMPISI.

DL T-4 does not know

whether CAMPISI

handled this whole amount or whether he laid some of it off.

The telephone number at the Egyptian Restaurant that

is used for handling bets and any booking business is TA 7-7711.

The other number at the Egyptian, TA 7-0355 is not used for

anything but regular restaurant business.

DL T-5 advised on June 15, 1970, that JOE CAMPISI hac

a burglary at the Egyptian Restaurant on the night of June 13-

14, 1970

during which the floor safe was opened and $10,000

taken. CAMPISI told DL T-5 he had $2,000 insurance on the loss

and noted there was no visible damage to the safe. DL T-5 asked
