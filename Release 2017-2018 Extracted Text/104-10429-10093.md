Subject's reactions to the polygraph indicate that he

never heard of OSWALD until after President Kennedy's

assassination in November 1963, that he was not an active

24 Octobar 1966

This is an interim report on progress to date in

the new phase in the interrogation of NOSENKO, which began

on 18 October 1966, and covers the first four days, 18-21

October. After a break, 1t will resume on 25 October.

Our aims in this phase of the interrogation have

been limited in view of the possibility of losing accesa

to NOSENKO, we have sought (a) to strengthen our basic report,

now. in preparation, by testing his story further, clarifying

points of confusion and revealing new contradictions, and

by polygraph examinations of key areas, and (b) to lead

toward his eventual confession by directly exploiting our

hypotheses about the true background of NOSEnKo and this

KGB operation,

to convey to NOSINKO the impression that we

know more than before, that we possess irrefutable proof

of his guilt and that ha has no prospecta for release.

he seened disturbed by our knowledge and the special areas

of interest we revealed, and we were able to develop In-

Method

Our basic approach has been to question NOSENKO in

specific terms on selected and detailed aspects of the story

he has told to date. We gave him no explanation for our

renewal of the interrogation, nor has he asked for any.

Our

questions have been pointed and detailed and neither require

Inter-

the matters covered in the interrogation and/or other topics.

Somewhat more time is spent on direct polygraph examination

than on interrogation.

there,

and on related questions,

Including some re-

lated to his ostensible investigation of Pavel SHAKHOV.

U.S. Personnel and Installations in Geneva:

NOSENKO was interrogated on his earlier story that

he had seen in Geneva in 1964 the file on KGB activity

against American Installationg in Geneva (KCH cryptonym

"SKORPION") • His version this time conflicted with

his 1964 version but contained the same message, that

the weak and understaffed KGB in Geneva had little

Interest, limited facilities and no success in opera

tions against the Americans and had practically no

Idea of the identitles of CIA personnel there.

addition, NOSENKO reacted to polygraph questions

related to whether the kos had told him the name of

his CIA case officers.

On the other hand, he did not

react to the names of the then COS Switzerland and

cos Geneva, which suggests that he was not told them

(these names were buried in lists of names).

He seemed disturbed

no reason to answer any more of them.

However, his

polygraph reactions did not suggest that he was as

sensitive to KISLOV as to other Individuals and matters

covered in the same series of questions.

saw TSYMBAI, twice in Geneva in 1964 and falled to

mention a Sunday meeting with TSYMBAl which he had

reported to us at the time it occurred.

This leaves

open the whole question of how NOSENKO can explain

his daily access to the Residency, which he himself

now says - evidently on the basis

of what he has

learned from our previous interrogations - is not

normally permitted....

This will be covered in further

questioning.

7.Matters Related to the PENKOVSKIY Compromises

8e:.

John ABIDIAN a. Visit to the pushkin Street

Deaddrop:

NOSINKO reacted with special sensitivity

and Intensity when asked in a polygraph test whether

he had been instructed to tell CIA about ABIDIAN'S

visit to the Pushkin Street deaddrop.

In addition.

he refused for the first time to aiscuss his own

participation in the incident, adamantly claiming

that he does not remember when or even whether he

visited the drop or whether he read reports on

surveillance coverage of it after ABIDIAN®s visit.

(He had earlier said he visited the drop at least

twice, immediately after ABIDIAN's visit, he des

cribed the location and named the KCB officers he

went with.)

In sharp contrast to his reluctance

to discuss his personal role was his unhesitating

and confident response to other aspects of the

Pushkin Street drop storys he reiterates that

ABIDIAN was under full time, double strength sur-

veillance throughout his tour in Moscow and that

ABIDIAN was surveilled to the drop.

He now adds,

for the first time, that the KGB concluded that the

drop had been initially found by a U.S. tourist or

delegation member and that ABIDIAN was meraly check-

ing out its suitability for some eventual use.

(In

fact, PENKOVSKlY proposed the drop and ABIDIAN went

there only in response to the agreed telephonic

signal triggered by persons unknown, not by PENKOV-

SKIY.)

acted strongly and consistently to questions on the subject.

tion of whether

an issue we have revewed with the FBI. NOSENKO must be

concerned because he now says that the

"supervised" it.

Thus disappears the sole case that NOSENKC

has claimed as his very own..

Identity and Personal Backqround: One of the basic

Concerning Lee Harvey OSHALD OR 18 October 1966

Backaround:

subject of this report is a thirty-eight year old married

male who, on 4 February 1964, established contact with United

States authorities in Geneva, Switzerland and asked for political

asy_uh.

subject was initially polygraphed on 4 April 1964 at a

covert security. location in Washiagton, D.C. suburbs (see

IND Report #67491, dated 8 April 1964).

The purpose of the

1964 polygraph interview was to establish whether subject was

a bona fide defector, or if he was a aispatched Soviet agent

sent by Soviet Intelligence on a specific mission

The con

clusion arrived at during the 1964 polygraph testing was that

Subject was attempting deceptiong that he was not a bona fide

defector, but a dispatched Soviet agent.

During the interin, April 1964 - October 1966, Subject

has undergone additional interrogation during which an attempt

was made to obtain the truth from subject, and to clarify the

many inconsistencies and discrepancies which were evident

throughout subject's version of his personal and professional

background history.

subject admitted to lying and falsifying

about some phases of his background only after long and tedius

Interrogation and after confrontation with Irrefutable facts

which subject could not argue against.

Subject has admitted

to exaggerating his own personal participation, his KCB rank.

and certain areas of his personal background.

He has not,

however, admitted deception concerning two main elements of

his KGB

operational history. even when confronted by logical

and factual contradiction in his story.

Purpose?

specific purpose of the 18 October 1966 polygraph

test was to:

fact actually involved in the OSWALD Case while OSWALD

was in the Soviet Union, or 1f his association with the

Procedure:

The undersigned polygraphed Subject at a covert security

location on 18 October 1966 between the hours of 1305 and 1810.

The testing was conducted in the Russian language.

subject Immediately recognized the undersigned ag the

polygraph officer who had administered the previous polystaph

test, and recalled the specific date of the test, 4 April 1964.

subject was told that he would again participate in another

polygraph intervier. Subject's polygraph patterns revealed a

certain amount of mscular movement during some of the phases

of testing, however, not withstanding this evidence it 1s the

opinion of the undersigned that there are polygraphic Indica-

tions of attempted deception by the subject to some of the

specific questions asked of him (see conclusion).

When Subject

was challenged and accused of deception, he would repeat that

he was telling only the truth now, and was telling the truth

during his last polygraph test.

when he was confronted with

the fact that he had lied to specific questions during his

1964 polygraph, and that these lies were subsequently con-

clusively proven to be lies, when he himself later (1965-1966)

admitted that he had fabricated about portions of his back

ground story. he admitted that this was

so, but that the lies

were minor and regarding personal areas of his background only.

He justified his past deception on the ground that he did so

only to embelish hia personal background to improve his image

in our eyes.

Discussion: which took place during the polygraph testing

and subject's additions to and revisions of his previous

statements are Incorporated in the SB report.

In analyzing Subject's polygraph charts, polygraphic

evidence or indication of deception was considered from the

standpoint of consistency and significance (strength) of the

reaction.

Reactions found to exist on nom or unimportant lead-in

questions, especially if these reactions are inconsistent, are

not noted as such in this report.

There is no logica. explan

ation for Subject's sensitivity to this catagory of questions

other than the possibility that some of these questions nay

be more meaningful to Subject than we are at present aware.

or that Subject is ecquainted with the polygraph technigue

and is attempting to create false, controlled reactions to

lead-in and harmless questions in an attempt to mislead poly-

graph analysis.

However, Subject's reactions to important questions when

noted as "reaction" are, in the opinion of the undersigned,
