Mr. AMOS

stated that

because of her exceptionally attractive appearance, Miss

BRITT has been used on occasions by National Air Lines as a

hostess at various official receptions.

No, Cs seid that wies BRiTt fornerly roomed with

JUANITAARERNANDEZ and PATRICIA ANNASANFORD, also National

Air Lines hostesses, but that some time ago they spilt up,

and

that Miss BRITT now shares a room or apartment with Miss

SANFORD Following this split.up, Miss FERNANDEZ reported to

Mr. AMOS that she was concerned about Miss BRITT because of

the fast company she had begun to associate with. Mr.

AMOS said that up to this point he has never had

occasion to

call Miss BRITT to task for any unbecoming or questionable

activity. He said that he had heard that CARLOS PRIO had

been seen in the company of some National Air Lines hostesses,

and had made several gifts of fur coats. He believed that

only Cüban National

said Miss ALEYON is the daughter of a very wealthy Cuban

family,

MI: AMOS said he had no reason to question Miss

BRITT's loyalty, rellability and integrity.

He pointed out,

however, that his relationship with Miss BRITT is that of

with her.

contained no derogatory information

A check of the records of the Miami Beach Police

Department, Miami Police Department, Municipal Court, and

the Dade County Sheriff's Office failed to disclose any

record of Miss BRITT.

The indices of the Miami Office are negative

relative to Miss BRITT with the exception of the information

caratfred in the PRIO case which reflects that she is

undoubtedly carrying on a clandestine, intimate affair with

PRIO: DU

It is believed that Miss BRITT could undoubtedly

furnish information of value

concerning PRIO's general

activities. In view of the Latin custom of dalliance, it is

very doubtful

whether PRIO has any deep interest in Miss

BRITT, and there have been some indications that he is also

playing around with another unidentified woman.

Information

received through MM 510-S and MM 512-Stalso does not reflect

that Miss BRITT IS actually in love wich PRIO, but is merely

carrying on this affair for other reasons.

to be a free spender, and it can be assumed that he has

undoubtedly presented her with some rather expensive gifts

• In view of the relationship between PRIO and Miss

BRITT, the possibility cannot be ignored that she might

advise PRIO of any contact made by this office or through

an intermediary for information relating to PRIO. At the

same time, however, in view of her position with National

Air Lines,

and the nature of her relationship with PRIO, it

is felt that there is a very good possibility that she woul

be willing to cooperate with

this office in furnishing informa-

tion concerning PRIU and his immediate plane. le

HAL

As the Bureau is aware, this office is presently

operating a highly confidential MISUR and TISUR set up with

pursuant to Bureau instructions.

In the absence of unforeseen circumstares, this

office plans to recommend the discontinuance of this Misuk:

and TISUR set up effective February 10, 1954•

Consequently,

in order to obtain appropriate intelligence coverage, It

will be advisable to increase, if possible, live iniormant

coverage In view of the fact that PRIO's close associates,

with the exception of JANE BRITT, are trusted Cubans who

formerly served in the PRIO government, the problem of

developing intormants

within his inner circle has been a

very difficult one.

In view of the above circumstances, it is

recommended that the Bureau authorize this office t

discreetly contact BRITT for the purpose of attempting to

develop her as a confidential security informant.
