groups which are individually active, as well as being

active in collaboration with the above mentioned larger

groups. An sstimite of the succugth of any of the groups

would be at-best only a guens since no records can possibly

be maintained.

All of the untergiound groups work

together, howaver, sharing supplies and information and

unity is no great problem sino? political considerations

are of no importance when contrasted to the primary

objective, the overthrow of CASTRO.

Underground activity does not yet approach the

level which was reached prior to the period of the April 17,

1961 invasion: The repressive mossures of the CASTRO

regine against the underground hrought all such activity

to a standstill for some time thereafter. Some underground

organizations vere literally wood out, and all were

seriously disrupted by the ariacts and executions ofrny

members and leadars.

The majonity of the activa members

of the underground in Cuba todoy are living in constant

fear that they will bs discovered by government agents

with the almost certain result bring esecution..

For this

reason Jiaison between members of individual groups, es

well as between grolips, is a serious problem, and one which

has

not been cvercome to date.

The Cuban people, as a whole, outwardly indicate

that they are in favor of the regine, although in private

it is believed that only & minority actually continue to

look with faver on the present ervernment.

It appears

that there is more open, widespread dissatisfaction with

the regime in sone of the outlying provinces than in Havana

Itself, sinec there is less overcment control in those

areas.

Despite this fear, the clandestine groups are

continuing lo meet and plan and to slowly guin new adherents

jeopardize their safety to enter the underground movement.

Regarding these living conditions, it is pointed out that

along with the sacadily incroscing lack of the basic

foods to which the Cuban is accustored, many other phases

of everyday life are affected. As an example, many

operatione in tha hoapitals in Caba today are being done

without banafit of anesthesia.

Members of the Cuban underground are somewhat

confussd es to

"thair proopsota for the future since they

feel that they are operating rome or less alone and

without the possibility or hope of substantial assistance

from the

exiles in Mismi.

Efforts to chain outaide assistance in the vay

of supplias, such as explosiven and detonators, lave been,

on the whale, disappointing.

Conseguently, there is

little ayopschy among the losiors of the underground

movement in Cuba for the leedare of the Cuban exiles in

the United States, most of this are considored political

opportunists.

The underground moverant in Cube recrived a

terrible set-back as a result of the unsuccessful invasion

attempt in April. The underground leaders believed that

their -gonization las an excallent one, which could have

been a pronisent factor in the invasion attempt if it had

only. been utilized. They feol now that in tine an efficient

of the CASINO Covernment.

Recently the morale of the underground has becn

harmed to sone extent by a runot wich was circulating,

particularly in Havana, to the effect that the United States

Goverument policy may be to set uy Cuba as a horrible

example of what communion vill bring, such as the example

of East Barlin as compared to Woot Berlin.
