The Chairman. But If you do have a prepared statement,

Mr. McNamara.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you have extra copies?

8

MI. McNamara. I unfortunately don't. I gave one to the

counsel a few minutes ago. It is a brief statement, three

The Chairman. Would you commence with the statement?

MI. McNamara. Yes.

On June 6, Mr. Chairman, as you will recall, I wrote.

1!!! I doubt that I have anything to contribute to your investigation

1f : 1f your staff or your committee wishes to question me about

my knowledge of the events you are investigating, I will be

very happy to respond."

My letter was wiitten because my name had been

:: aqainat Premier Castro.

The Chairman. Did you mean to yay repeated or

Mr. McNamara. Beg your pardon. I meant to say reported.

It seems to me the seriousness of, the repeated or reported

seriousness of, the charges your connittee was examining outweighed

any question of the appropriateness of my testifying, given

6

my obligation as an international civil servant.

The first thing I want to say le that I have no knowledge

6

or Information of any proposal for the amassination of Premder

Castro coming from Preaident Kennedy or Robert Kennedy. In

8

fact, I would regard such a proposal am totally inconslatent

with everything I know about the two men.

secondly, It has been assertod in the press that an a

1:

meeting I attended on August 10, '62, with Socretary Rusk,

1::

John McCono, then Director of Central Intelligence,

!!: and McGeorge Bundy, the question of assassination was raised

14

and dismissed but that shortly after meeting a memorandum

1! ¿ was circulated by Major General Edward Lansdale calling for a

number of actions relating to the situation in Cuba, Including

:: "

the preparation of contingency plans for Castro's assassina-

! tion; that when a copy of the memorandum recahed ME. MoCone

effect he had been requested by Robert. t. Kennedy to develo::

envisioned the whole speatrum of plans from overthrowing the

2

Cuban leader to assassinating him, although the then Attorney

General It was said never uned the word assassination.

Landale was reported to have said he developed the plans

5

without the knowledge of myself or MI: McCone, but that me

both had become aware of the planning later.

+7

Later news stories state that Lanodale modified him

statemont to say "perhapa some place in the plane there was

something to do about the leader who had threatened the

1::

lives of millions of Americans", and to claim that he, Lansdale.

"ruled out assassination" because "that is not my bag anyway".

Since reading these press utories I have tried to recon-

"iatruct the actual sequence of ovents and I have refreshed my

ii: recollection from documents in your committee's possession,

; from conversations with other persons involved, and from a

• Elle memorandum written in 1967 that Mr. Mecone was able to

produce for me.

As I reconstruct it this is what happened.

Following the Bay of Pigs and extending throughout the

spring and sunner of '62, there was a good deal of concern

within the U.S. Government about attempted subversion of Lat::.

:: American Governments by the Communist regime in Cuba. To

thwart these attumpts the continuing program of covert ac

:: tivities directed against the Castro rogime was mounted under

the direction

beloro completing my statement.

I believe General Landale had been attached from the

assignment in the Defense Department to serve as Stall

Director of this group beginning sometime in late '61 or

early '62. In August '62 several meetings of the group vere

held. On at least one occasion prinelpals, including secretary

Rusk and myself, were in attendance.

In one or more of the meetings of the group the subject

of

a 88

assination of Premier Castro was apparently discussed.

It was brought to his attention.

At that time I expressed opposition to any assasmination

I have no knowledge or information about any other plans

or preparations for a possible assassination attempt against

Premier Castro.

14

I believe now and I think Mr. McCone's memorandum

supports my recollection, that I believed then that the

ir.

U.S. Government should

not undertake or encourage assassina-

against people with whom we

are

not at war.

It may be argued that given the extensive program of

government was engaged at the time that it would only be

short term to attempted

assassination but I can't accupt that

argument on its face.

Mr. McNamara. In advance of the hearing.

Mr. Schwarz. Markod an Exhibit 3.

MI. McNamara.

Even the statement of Harvey's memo

doesn't say I proposed assassination of Castro. It says the

question of assassination of Castro was raised or was up, to

be precise.

I don't wish to try to read into that moro than li

appropriate, but it doesn't say I proposed it, and I am not

about to say I proposed it. I have no recollection of 1t.

The four senior associates I have talked with, Mesara.

Taylor, Bundy, Gilpatric and Rusk, have no recollection of in:

raising it. It la entirely out of character with what I belive

I thought at the time and I do not read into that those words

In a corner, trapping the witness, we are trying to find the

baseline minimum of what was said with respect to assassina-

tion or elimination of leaders. My Interpretation of the record

so far la that 1t 18 alleged, and I belleve proven with good

evidence, both verbal testimony and documentary evidence,

that the subject proposale came up at that meeting, but not

beyond the shadow of a doubt that it was sald by the Secretary.

Let me tell you why I said that.

Page 33 of McCone's testimony ia as follows:

10

"I take it then that according to your best rocollection

the subject of liquidating Castro and possibly other top

::! Cuban leadors did come up at that mooting and you did take

::'" atrong exception to 1t7"

McCone: "Yes."

So it seems clear to me McCone does remember independent!!

iri

the subject coming up.

To continue with McCone's answer:

"I was not alone in that.

'I rememver that very clearly."

MI. Murrow took exception.

It acems to me the barcline minimum is that apparently

the subjoct did come up and was shot down. We have only thi

remaining question of whether or not the witness bofore us

i:

now brought it up or somcone else did.

Then the question I will put to MI. McNamara, do you

remember it coming up?

question of assa--ination 1a now not immaterial, but I think

the fact that it has now been ostablished to my satisfaction

that the question was raised, that probably meets the needs of

didn't.

8

But there 18 one point that' I would like for you to

9

comment on.

10

Following the minutes of the mooting on August 10, we

11

1?!

have a number of memoranda which have already been reforred

to, and as the Chairman has pointed out, the memorandum of

1: " August 13 from Lansdale, which was just three days after che

meeting, starts off, as our Chairman so well pointed out,

:!.

"In compliance with the desires and guidance expressed in

the 10 August policy meeting".

I note, it seoms to me, Just three days afterward, it

1.:

would be unlikely that he would write that into a memorandum

1f he did not feel that that was actually his inatructions.

:. and disseminate that memorandum.

Then when you go following that memorandum, that is thr

one you recall that he usod the words that were later excist.

The very next day wa have the Harvey memorandum which

takes feneral Lansdale to task for raising the question of

21

assassination. Hut then he goos on to say that "I was preser

or "I took careful notes on the comments at this meeting on

the point", and so on.

He says a question of assassination, particularly of

Fidel Castro, was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the

5

6

meeting of the Special Group, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

And the last sentence of a paragraph in "I took careful

notes".

8

Now, add to that the Inspector General's report that

9

10

was made in 1967, which was seven years ago, which says -

does he havo a copy of that?. It 18 under Tab C.

1:

The Inspector General raport starts off saying that

Tom Parrott's minutes of the meeting make no montion of tho

subject of assassination. Both McCone and llarvey recall that

14

McNamara raised the question or raised the subject.

16,

Harvey's notes taken at the meeting show that

It was also mentioned by Murrow but the nature of the comment

1:: was not recorded, Mi. McCone states in the memorandum 14 April

As a matter of fact, I heard the counsel road a statement

from the CIA Inspector General which indicates they were not

going ahoad and planning on that basis.

Numbar 2, MeCone's objection to the letter man not, or

to the Lanadale momo, was not to the written statement that

they should plan. His objection was to any planning and

my opjection was to any planning and his memo makes that very

Icoar. I am relying on his memory, not mina, but the memo

Now, is there anything that you can toll us that would

Mr. McNamara. I can only tell you what will furthor

so much so that I feel as a sonior official of the government

I must assume the responsibility for the actions of the tro.

putting assassination aside just for the moment. But I know

of no major action taken by CIA during the time I was in the

government that was not properly authorized by senior officials.

And when I say that I want to emphasize also that I believe

with hindsight we authorized actions that were contrary to

the interest of the ropublic but I don't want it on the

record that the CIA was uncontrolled, was operating wie!

Quoting from the IG report.

"Former Attorney General

Robert Konnedy was fully briofed by Houston and Edwards on

I May '62. Momorandum confirming the oral briefing was forwarded

to Kennedy on 14 May '62." The memorandum does not use

the word "sassination," but there la little room for

misinterprotation of what it meant.

Presumably the original of that mono 1a still in the

filos of tho Justice Dapartmont. It should bo noted the

briefing of Konnedy was restricted to Phase I operation which.

had ended about a yoar carlier. Phaso it was already under

way at the time of the briefing but konnedy was not told of de.

The Chairman. I think that latter part which sonator

Baker was fair enough to include, together with some testimon:

that corroborates the fact, indicates at one point the

Attorney General was briefed about phase l of the operation

having to do with an attempt againat Castro's life, but was

briefed in such a manner that he was lead to belleve that the!

that this won a phase Il, a new effort then underway to

questioned Langdale about it.

becauso what Lansdale told you bears upon his credibility.

lle has been before us, wo know what he has told us, and we

havo had various appraisala given this Committee of Lanadalo

by people who know him vory well. He claims he has been

misquotad in the press. In unsworn tostimony he did not

charge Robort Konnedy with having given him inatructions as .

to assassinate Castro.

Now, that in tho altuation.

If you could tell un

what he told you it would holp us in our svaluation of cho

Senator Bakor. Thank you very

much.

Let mo simply say for MI. McNamara, let me mato a

statement that I think the Committee fully

understands but

I want him to understand.

In the course of my career in the Senate, I have nover

been involved in a situation of such great sensitivity as

this situation. In the course of this inquiry I think one

of the most romarkable attributes of this Committce has her:

its calr in the fact of coordinated circumstance unfolding

and unlikely paradox that appear before

us. I think that :.

nember of the committee will auren that no effort has been

made so far tu bully the reputation of any living or doat

been totally and completely and effectually resisted. No

one is attempting to do that now. The committee knows 1t and

I want to know it.

Mr. Chairman, I would like the witnoss to answer the

question.

• Mr. McNamara. I have tried not to sully anyone'a repu-

tation and I haven't commented to the press except my own

reputation being sullied, and one of the reason i haven't

is that until the full story gots out, explanations of

partial partisan is bound to stimulnto other partisan respon

BoB and it simply perpetuates this speculation about

indivisuals, some of them dead, and others incapable of

jefending themselves.. So I have been vory caroful what 1

have said.

Now, I will answer. your questions, since you know more

than I do already about Lanadale, I think in this aituation.

But in answer to my question, to him as to whom he worri:

for, he said ho worked for

a committee and the chairman of

the conmittce, but this was only after ! asked him about thr

memo relatiny to the August 10 discussion that was referre!

to in the press as statiny that Lansdale asked CIA to prepar

an

assassination plan. I said who gavo you the instruction.

Now, this 1a to disagree a second. That was a telephone

personally, to the beat of my knowledge, was in saigon.

with it. Thore was no opposition from anyone in a sendor

was a clear error. This became apparant to some of us

shortly afterwards. It certainly wasn't apparent prior to

tho time but it became apparent shortly afterward.

Dospito our feeling that lt was a sorious error, there

was also an opposing force influencing us, because during

was a liat of measures we would take following contingency

such as the death of Castro, Assume, if you will, with me,

as is the fact demonstrated by the recrod this morning --

that in this perlod of time there were a number of such

studies, culminating, incidentially, In one that said 1t

would not improve the position of the Unitod States.

But

do you know of any other country whore stidies were mado of

what would happon if a particular leador died?

Mr. McNamara.. I am sure - - I am sure thero wore

studios of that kind. There were. At the time the govornmen:

of many parts of the world were unstahle, there were frequen:

changes.

I remember in connuction with the then Congo,.

for example, there were possibilities of raplacement of

leaders, and I am sure that studios were made of action we

would take if "x" were to be overthrown or died or othorwise

be replaced.

It was quite: a customary contingency to ixamino.

Mir. Smothers.

Mr. Smothers.

Didyou spend much time talking about the l

subject of this investigation?

MI. McNamara.

Well, I am sure we talked about it. I

¡don't know how much time.

I got home about 7:30 at night and

o i he was with us for dinner, my wife and 1 and him, and I took

7: him back to his hotel around ten. My wile was with un much of

the time and I am sure we didn't talk about it while she was

Mr. Smothers. Do you have any present recollection of

been following thess pross clippings rather closely, ad i

Indicated to you oarlior, and there has been a series of

romemberod me raising the quustion of elimination o! Castro

when McCone said he didn't, and the memo indicates the memo ot

my conversation, which I probably also showed Mr. Gilpatric

indicates he did not remember me raising the lasue.

So, I probably showed both the memo of my conversation

with Mccone and MoConu's memo of April '67 to Mr. Gilpatric.

Mr. Smothers.

1. No memorandum can be locatod covering tho August 10, 1962

meeting; however, it la highly probablo that ono axiate.

2. Meelings of August 8 or 9, 1962, In the JCS Oporations Room

(Penegon) and ugust 10, 1962, in Secretary Rusk's Confarence Room

more for the purposo of considering stall proposals for Phase ll of opera-

tion MONGOOSE. This operation was under the direction of Goneral

Lanadalo, with Im. Harvey handling ClA participatlon (under FlizGerald).

Al ona ol these moglings - probably the moating in the JCS Room .- 1

socall a suggostion being made to liquidalo top people in tha Castro

regimo, including Castro, I took immedialo excaption so this suggastion.

slaling that the subject was completoly out of bounds an lar as the USC

and ClA wure concerned and thu idaa should not bo discussed nor should

1l appear in any papers, do the USG could not considor such actions on

moral or elhical grounds.

3. Immodiaiely alier the meeting, I called on Sacretary McNamar..

parsonally and re-einphasized my porition, In which he heartily agreed.

I did this because operation MONGOOSE

-= an intur-desarimental affair -

was undor the operational control of DOD through the JCS.

4. Al no time did the suggestion rocoive serious considoration

by lhe Special Group (augmented) nor by any individual responsible for

policy.

5. Through the years the Cuban problom was discussed in terms

such as "dispose of Castro," "remove Castro," "knock off Castro," eic..

and this meant the overthrow of the Communiat Government in Cuba and

ide replacing of it with a democratic rogune. Terms such as tho above

appear in mary mortini, paperi, memuranda for the record, olc., and, as

stiled, all sefer to is change in the Cuban Guvernment.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Diroctor (Plans)

SUBJECT

¿ Operation MONGOOSE

r.

1. Actlon. None. This memorandum la for your informalion.

Z. Reference la made to our conversation on 19 August 1962.

concerning the memorandum of lhat dale from General Lanadale.

Allachod is a copy of this memorandum, excised from which are

four words in the second lino of the penullimato paragraph on

page l. Those lour worde were "including liguldation of loadera."

3. The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel Castro.

was brought up by Secrelasy McNamara al the mucing o! the

Special Group (Augmented) in Secretary Rust's oblica vii lû dugum.

It was the obvious consensus at that mecting, in answer lo a

coinment by Mr. Ed Murrow, thai this de not a subjack which

has been mado a malter of official record. I look careíul noies on

tbe commente al this mecting on this point, and the Special Group

(Augmented) is not expecting any written comments or sludy on

this point.

Upon receipi of the attached memorandum, I called

Lanadale's olfice and, in his absence, pointed out to Frank Hand

the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this sype of comment in

writing in such a document. ladvised Frank Hand that, as far

as ClA was concerned, we would write no document pertaining to

this and would anicipair in no upen meeting discussing it.

I atrongly urged Hand to recommond so Lansdale that he exciso
