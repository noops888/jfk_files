KARATSUBA's office, greets him and asks about a bottlo.

KARATSUBA

roplies, how about Old Grand Dad. DIAZ thinks that will be a good

start.

KARATSUBA states that one of his nonspapers carried an articlo

in which a world champion rife shot mas quoted as saying that one

man could not fire the weapon killing Pres. Hennedy three times

in five seconds, would take at least two men. DIAZ does not think

they got the right rifle, then relatos that the NY Times has an

article stating that OSWALDS mother was show a picture of RUBY

seventeen hours beforo OSWALD mas killed. KARATSUBA states that

the important thing to him is hon OSWALD could be such a good shot

after being out of the Marines for three or four years and spending

to and a half joars in the Soviet Union where they would not let

him have a gun.

satos the important thing is not whather ho is

Marxist or what ever but that he did so nell in five seconds and

only ordered the gun in August. KARATSUBA statos the FBI saw

OSWALD carry the gun in a packago, DIAZ xorrects him and stator

1t was neighbors who saw the package. DIAZ wonders where Gen.

WALKIR was during this time. DIAZ thinke the FBI isinvolved

with the Dallas State Police, laughs and states thinke the Govenor

has a finger in the pio.

KARA TSUBA does not think the FBI was

involved.

DIAZ tells KARATSUBA he should read about MALCOHM X

speech made at Manhattan Center. KARATSUBA heard over the radio

that there were films showing tho men in the windor.

FEINSTEIN

enters.

DIAZ toldo KARATSUBA quickly and softly, "hide the bottle,

hide the bottle." KARATSUBA tella FEINSTEIN that ho talled with

TOMACHINSKI Who Wants to see him on business, FEINSTE N exits.

They return to the discussion of the two men in the window,, KARAT

states ho would not be suprised if the other man was a policeman,

laugha. DIAZ suggest that maybe one mas a I--king policanan and

the other one FBI, states these f-king FBI Agents are local boys

and they are all poisoned and notional about this shit. DIAZ asks

wonder where is BOBBY, he allwayayhad a big mouth, where ishe now.

KARAT states everybody had something to say but BOBBY, K thinks

BOBBY knows just a little bit more than anyone who just opens his

mouth. DIAZ states hasn't heard too much from HOOVER. K asks, HERBERT?

DIAZ a tatos no, EDGAR.

Katates, he is in poor health you knon.
