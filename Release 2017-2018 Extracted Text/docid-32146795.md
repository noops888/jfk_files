information of Dallas.

Enclosed for Legat are title page and 40 pages of your

5/18 last summary letterhead in this case which have been amended

by the Bureau in order to enable declassification of your sumnary

letterhead.

The declassified version of your summary letterhead

has been reproduced by the Bureau on xerox equipment and, where

possible,

the pages

in your original summary were utilized in the

unclassified version.

The 40 pages enclosed herewith, when

inserted among the appropriate pages in your classified letterhead,

constitute the unclassified version furnished to the President's

Commission.

Note in this regard that the information set forth

on pages 122 through and including 127 of your classified letter-

head has been condensed into pages 122 through and including

124 in the unclassified version.

This has necessitated renumbering

the pages in the original draft beginning with page 128. The

unclassified version is now 178 pages in length as opposed to

the 181-page classified version.

Note that on page 304 of the Commission's summary report

the Commission states in part as follows,

"...the Government of

Mexico initiated a thorough investigation to uncover as much

information as possible on Oswald's trip.

Representatives of U. S.

agencies worked in close liaison with the Mexican law enforcement

authorities."

With this in mind, the Bureau rewrote your

introductory paragraph on page one of the letterhead.

NTIAL

introductory statement coincides with aforementioned statement of

the Commission and is designed to emphasize the liaison capacity of

U. S. representatives in Mexico. You will note that the Bureau

did not delete all references

unclassified version for in Bureau's opinion to do so and to

merely report results of investigation in a Bureau letterhead

without reference to various sources would create the impression

that Bureau representatives, in fact, conducted the reported

investigation.

Note, however, that

all references in your

classified version to the first confidential source abroad have

either been deleted or attributed to T-17, who is identified in

your 5/18 letter transmitting the summary. In addition, all

references to T symbol sources, who obviously were members of the

Embassy staff, have been deleted. The latter area includes

reporting of

results of interviews of people who called at the

Embassy to volunteer information.

In preparing the unclassified version, the Bureau has

endeavored to include therein results of all investigation;

specifically requested by the Commission,and any investigation

which was touched upon in the Commissions summary report.

Accordingly, it was not possible to completely delete all

of the

information concerning Chartes smarteen further condensed

The information concerning

Small furnished byMEX 18 and#9 aa

in the unclassified version and dates when information was

furnished by sources have been deleted.

In view of the extensive investigation conducted

into the allegations of Gutierrez Valencia and in light of the

tenuous nature of his claims, Bureau deemed it inadvisable to

delete his identity.

In accordance with your suggestions, the names of

most of the Mexican Government officials who provided information

have been either deleted or protected by informant symbol in

the unclassified version.

If after review of the unclassified letterhead you

desire to prepare your contacts in the Mexican Government for its

publication, you are authorized to do so.

It is suggested in

this regard that you point to the statement of the President's

Commission outlined above and stress to your contacts that the

excellent investigative results obtained in connection with the

matter at hand, which was of world-wide importance, should

reflect favorably upon the Mexican Government. Note that the

unclassified letterhead which has been furnished to the Commission
