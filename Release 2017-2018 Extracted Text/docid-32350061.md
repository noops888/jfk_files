•E. THE PRESENT GOVI SEEMS TO BE BY FAR THE MOST DETERMINED

GROUP TO MAINTAIN LAW AND ORDER AT ALL COSTS WHILE STILL

RECOGNIZING THIS IS NOT THE CURE BUT IS ONLY BUYING TIME.

CONVERSELY THE PNP IS REGARDED AS THE MORE LIBERAL, PERSONAL

FREEDOM AND EXPRESSION ADVOCATE WITH A GOOD SPRINKLING OF RADICAL

EXTREMISTS WHO HAVE PROMOTED DISSENSION AND CHANGE AT ALL COSTS:

CIHE PNP IN POWER MIGHT BE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THOUGH IN ITS INTEREST

OF SELF PRESERVATION.

F: THERE ARE RUMORS OF LOCAL POLICE IN VARYING LEVELS AND

DEGREES REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN GANJA TRAFFIC OR ACCEPIING

BRIBES: SEE PARAS B& C. ABOVE) • THE COP ON THE BEAI IN WEST

KINGSTON AND DOWNTOWN KINGSTON REPORIEDLY WILL ADVISE TOURISTS WHERE

TO GET GANJA. OTHER HIGHER RANKING POLICE OFFICERS SUCH AS IDEN

D ARE REGARDED AS HAVING TOO EXPENSIVE HOMES AND CARS ETC. FOR THE

EAGER SALARY RECETVED THEREFORE MUST BE TAKING IT ON THE SIDE.

INDEED MOST HIGH GOVI OFFICIALS SEEM TO HAVE MORE WORLDY GOODS THAT

THEIR SALARY WOULD PROVIDE BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE THE ACCEPTED WAY

OF LIFE HERE.
