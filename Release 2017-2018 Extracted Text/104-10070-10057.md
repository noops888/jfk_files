18 October 1868

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with John Thomas Duncan: Project AMWIDE Candidate

(1145 - 1515 hours, 8 October 1968; Rossyz, Virginig)

and I met briefly with "Tom" Duncan in the lobby

of the Holiday Inn, Rosslyn, Virginia, after which Duncan and I had lunch

at the Orleans House. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss any prob

lem arcas or questions which Dancan may have had incident to his coming

"on board, " Further, I was to remain with Duncan until such the 2s he would

be introduced tol

that efternoon. (NOTE: The latter session was

arranged for the purpose of having Duncan aign the contract which had been

prepared for him, and to enplain his cover arrengement and other pertirent

administrasive details.

2. During the earlier discuscion,

Duncan and I chatted for

nearly thiry minutes; though Duncen mentioned (1) the akin fungus which ho

had contracted during an earlior vinit to Florida; and (a) lia dealre to conter

by telephone with his doctore concerning the results of receat clan teste,

Duncan did not give any indication that ho intended to rcfuse the posidon for

which he had been sclected. Having till anothes eppointment,

cused himcell at about 1230 hours and told Duncan that he hoped they might

have en opportunity to got togethor prior to Duncan's departure.

8. Subsequently, Duncan and I lunched together, during which time the

conversation turned to Duncan'e recent travels and his several visits to univer..

-aity campuses while enroute to Washington. He mentioned that he had found

the doctoral program at the University of Minnesota particularly attrackie.

He did not say that he intended to enroll at that institution, but he several times

alluded to "picking up the doctorate" at some future date.

With reference to

the aforementioned AMWIDE position,

Duncan stated that he could not do may

thing - (While In the Agency's employ) - which might run counter to ble

"principles"or set of values. I assured him that it was extremely unlikely

that he would experience any difficulty in that regard, and I recalled at that

time how casual he seomed throughout our brief discussion of his forthcoming

afilMation with the Agency. In retrospect, it seems quite clear that Duncan

was not really interested in being reassured; his decicion to refuco the Agency's

offer of employment hed likely been cached days before.

4. During the course of the afternoon meeting with

and inter

with George Powell and Richard Elladeau, it was my impression that neither

the terme of the contract nor the assigment of a pseudonym was of para-

mount concern. Rather, Duncan'e expressed missivinge were only superficial

excuses for backing out of a relationship which he had come to rew as untenable.

Doubtless,

his skin condition was a factor, however, had Duncan been culcienty

enthusiastic about joining the AMWIDE project, it is my feeling that he would

have done so deapite his malady. (NOTE: The doctors roportedly told Duncan

that many people living in Flonida had the same problem, and that Duncan "could

live with it. ")

5. In sum, it is my opinion that Duncan was unwilling to accept the job

regardless of the torms which he might be able to exact, e.g, thirtcon monthe

as opposed to two-years, etc. It is concelvable that had it not beca for Duncen'o

desire to vicit relatives in the Washington, D. Co, area, he may no. have pEo

sented himsed at al Why Duncan agrced to meet with

Poroll and

Biladeau remains something of a mystery to me. He may have fcl come obligation

57 for whom he expressed ligh regard, or ha may have done so simply

out of curiosity.

6. Security Implicationa: Known to Duncan are the true name and adereas

Of AMWIDE's production facility, and the true name of Cedric D. BARTLUCCI.

Though it is not believed that Duncan will cause this information to become

known, Station JMCODRA has been alerted to the possibility.

OPERATIONS CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: Mecting with IDEN and Wile

DATE AND PLACE: 23 July 1068, 1000 - 2000 jure, Aluguerque,

New Mesco

1. Clyde B. MEGENNITY first met IDEN alone during the morning

of 23 July; the meeting was held in MEGENNITY'& Lotel room. MEGENNITY

introduced himsoll as a repzesentntive a INHARP, Indicating to IDEN that

he was involved in worl of a confidential nature for INHARP.

IDEN waS

then given the broad outline of the AMWIDE job. This included location in

the JACOBRA area, work as a producer/corint uriter, posalble travel

throughout the Caribbean, and a general calary bracket around $10, 000.

IDEN was aloo told that LNEARP would pay his transportetion and moving

coste to the JMCOBRA area.

2. IDEN ctated that ho had elready intended to submit (on 1 August)

a thisty day socionation notice from his current job as the Univereity of

New Mexico's TV Sludio. He indicated that he and lia wife planned to go

to Europe end coond appronmately six montko cludying and travelling.

IDEN Ls interocted in eludying broadcasting techniques and operations in

Smitzosland, He indicated come regret over tha possibility ai having to

cancel these plans, however acknowiedged the career job opportunities

that the AMWIDE offer would alford him.

3. In answering addillonal questions about the job itself, IDEN was

told that he would be working ostensibly for a commercia: company en-

gaged in the preparation of program materials for the Latin American

audience. IDEN was advised that these programs would be of social

economic naturo, designed to be progressive and reformist in tone.

IDEN seemed most interested in the concept and, according to several

remarke he made throughout the day, the nature of the broadcaste tite

in quite well with his own political thinking concerning the Latin America

area.

At noon time MEGENNITY met IDEN's wife. She is an intell-

gens and vivacious person who obvlously would be very much interested

in, and involved in, anything her husband would be doing. She was given

more or less the same cover run down concerning the AMWIDE Job.

expressed great interest and asked ll there wes any role she could do in

this venture.

5. During the afternoon IDEN and his wife drove MEGENNITY

throughout the Albuguerque and Santa Fe area showing him several sights,

but also discuscing the overall job considerations and ramifications.

6. IDEN indicated to MEGENNITY that his Spanish was adeguate for

handling virtually all situations.

He feels completely at ease verbally

with the language and indicated he could conduct Spanish interviews and

personal reporting jobs for AMWIDE. It did not seem appropriate to test

his Spanish capability. His wife bas little or no Spanish. Neither IDEN

nor bie wite has travelled or lived in the eastern United States. The idea

cí going to the JMCOBRA area obvioualy is new to them and they approach-

ed it with come roservatione. MEGINNITY indicated that 18 a chort visit

to the SMOOBRA area might catfely their curtocity, and asiat them in

making a decition concerting the acceptance of the AMWIDE job, that

such a vialt could probably be arranged.

7. it de MEGENNITY's opinion that both these individuals are

highly culted for the AMIDE job. They are curious intellectually, have

a very pregmatie outlook on political matters, are most enthuciastle

about things which interest them, and seem lite a fine team asset to have

at the AMIVIDE Facility. MEGENNITY fcels, wherever posaible, we

bould make inducements to insure that IDUN and kis vile decide favorably

in acceptance of the AMIDE job. MEGENITY urged them to call him at

any time they had questions and couaideralians and, above all, not to make

any final declaion (particularly neative) vithout discussing it with MEGE-

NNITY (what WECENNITY had in mind here, was the flanibility to susgest

that they might go to Europe for as long an three months and then return

to start at the AMWIDE jab around 1 December).

&. The experience in visiting the IDENS, both of whom are young,

without roote - elther family or professionally and who are already

giving up their current jobs, indicates that the problem of recruiting

personnel for AMWIDE is Indeed going to be a difficult one. It is MEGE-
