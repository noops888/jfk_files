The Orlando telephone number CH 1-2310 is the

Orlando.

during a weekend "several weeks ago" when LEWIS

_and her son for two or three days.

friends in the Miami area; however, source stated the

identities of the persons were not known.

III. LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE

Re: Miami Pest Control

Miami, Florida

TP T-2 on February 8, 1962, indicated that

ANGELO BRUNO and his brother-in-law,

RALPH MARANCA,

in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had discussed SANTO,

who was in Miami, Florida, that BRUNO knew SANTO had

no legitimate means of support, and that they, BRUNO

and SANTO, considered getting many customers on Miami

Beach and

in Miami, for an extermination business:

The

business would be Miami Pest Control, registered

in

Miami; and BRUNO was desirous of getting a man with a

college degree in business administration to head the company,

having complete control of the company. Source indicated,

however, that BRUNO had difficulties in placing his plans.

into operation in Miami as apparently the man with the

college degree did not want any part of any illegitimate

deal and had to be assured by BRUNO that they, BRUNO and

SANTO, were more interested in running the business

legitimately than even the college degree man, noting

the college man need only hire men to do the work and

that BRUNO and SANTO could get all the customers.

Sub-

sequently,

the college man apparently saw SANTO's, VITO's

college man indicated his family did not want any deal

with BRUNO and SANTO.
