105-2855

On October 15, 1965, Miami informant MM T-1,

a Cuban exile who is well acquainted with some members

of the MIRR, reported that on October 14, 1965, BOSCH's

right hand man, MARCELINO GARCIA JIMENEZ, was partici-

pating in a discussion of BOSCH's news release concern-

ing the "Satrustegul."

MARCELINO GARCIA was upset be-

cause BOSCH had claimed responsibility for the bombing,

and he added that he, himself, had told BOSCH that BOSCH

should not tell such

a lie, as this explosion was either

an accidental explosion or the work of some Cuban exiles

in San Juan, and that BOSCH had no business making this

false claim

for his own benefit.

On October 14, 1965, MM T-2, a member of the

MIRR who has been well informed concerning activities of

this organization for a period of several years, expressed

the opinion that BOSCH falsely claimed credit for causing

damage to the "Satrustegui" in order to get publicity for

himselt and the will, and in order to lacilitate lund

raising among sympathetic Cuban exiles.

MM T-2 said that on Monday, October 11, 1965,

BOSCH received a letter from the San Juan delegate of

the

MIRR,

and that this letter made no comment whatsoever

about the explosion.

Subsequently, on October 22, 1965, MM I-, after

making further inquiry concerning the

incident of the

"Satrustegui," reported that none of the other members of

the MIRR believed that the MIRR was responsible for the

explosion, and they treated BOSCH's claim as a Joke.

thermore, according to MM T-2, BOSCH has no "frogmen" or

commandoes, and he said that BOSCH's claims of having men

constantly on the alert throughout the Caribbean to engage

in sabotage and other acts,

whenever and wherever the oppor-

tunity exists, are completely false.

MM T-2 said that BOSCH

has only two action men, namely, DANIEL ORLANDO RAMIREZ

neither RAMIREZ nor

October 9, 1965, and that had either of these individ-

uals been involved in this explosion, MM T-2 felt certain

that he and the other members of the MIRR would have be-

come aware of the operation.

MM T-2 expressed the opinion

that both RAMIREZ and GUTIERREZ have the ability to manu-

facture and place a bomb capable of damaging a ship.

o onion

How-

ever, the MIRR has no other men who possess the knowledge

or qualifications to bomb a ship. MM T-2 said that the

MIRR members in San Juan are few in number, and that most

of them are middle-aged businessmen who have neither the

qualifications nor the temperament to engage in such an

activity.

MM T-2 said that BOSCH is regarded by a number

of the members of the MIRR as being a liar, dishonest, and

of very questionable character.

Other investigation conducted relative to the

explosion of the "Satrustegui" in the Miami area, as well

as in San Juan, Puerto Rico, has failed to develop any

tangible evidence whatsoever that BOSCH or any member of

the MIRR was actually responsible for the explosion.

of a .57 mm. recoilless rifle. One of these operatiors

involved a commando boat raid on Santa Cruz del Norte,

Havana Province; the second, a small operation against

the Arechabala refinery in Cardenas, Matanzas Province;

and the third would be an attack at

sea against a Cuban

P.T. boat. MM T-4's source said that the MIRR and the

should zeke army to the attack when it l8 announced. (EX$ (u)

On October 29, 1965, MM Tol reported having

received information from a source described as an

educated Cuban emigre in the public information field.

According to this source, on October 26, 1965 BOSCH

said he has all the equipment necessary to destroy the

Arechabala refinery and that if the MIRR could effect

this operation, FIDEL, CASTRO would react against the

so-called "open door policy." (5P)CR(4)

On November 2, 1965, MM I-6, a Cuban exile

who has been involved in revolutionary activities for

several years in Miami, advised that about one week

previously a 4 man group of Cuban exiles approached a

Cuban exile leader, who has control over a 25° boat with

twin-engines. The 4 man group was composed of RICARDO

MORALES, JORGE RODRIGUEZ TRIANA, MANUEL BENITE and

Fla

(First Name Unknown) BLANCO, described as an airplane

pilot.

These 4 Cubans explained that they wanted use

of this boat for an attack on a distillery located at

Santa Cruz del Norte, Havana Province.

They also

dis-

closed that ORLANDO BOSCH had given them a .57 mmm.

recoilless rifle, and five projectiles for this rifle,

which would be used in this operation.

MM T-6 stated that the individual who controls the 259

boat turned down the request of these & Cubans. MM T-6

did not know if the & Cubans had succeeded in obtaining

On September 14 and 29, 1965, MM T-2 advised

that he possessed no information concerning any specific

operations planned by the MIRR in the immediate future.

MM T-2 said that BOSCH is constantly making plans and

counterplans and bragging about what he will accomplish.

He approaches various exile groups and wealthy Cuban

exiles in the Miami area in an effort to get them to

contribute money to finance a raid by the MIRR against

Cuba. On July 30, 1965, BOSCH obtained $3,000 from

RECE. MM T-2 suspects that most of this money has gone

into the pockets of BOSCH and MARCELINO CARCIA.

MM I"2 said that BOSCH has become a fanatical

egomaniac, to the point where most of the members of the

MIRR are becoming uneasy under his leadership. BOSCH

believes, for instance, that he can treat with the United

States and foreign governments on matters relating to

Cuba and foreign policy.

INTERNAL ORGANIZATION PROBLEMS

On September 23, 1965, MM T-2 advised that a

number of the members of MIRR had become disenchanted

with the leadership of BOSCH and his little clique which

controls the MIRR, and which engages in activities without

the knowledge or approVal of the membership at large.

MM T-2 said that the opposition group to BOSCH have

been making preparations to preserve copies of certain

financial records which BOSCH and MARCELINO GARCIA have

been attempting to obtain unsuccessfully from LAREDO

RODRIGUEZ RIVERA, Treasurer, and ORLANDO REGO, BORREGO,

Auditor of the MIRR

ORGI

MM T-2 explained that during the past month or

2 indications are that BOSCH has not been accounting for

monies received, for monies disbursed and also, BOSCH 1s

no longer gainfully employed at the Abbey Medical Clinic,

and the membership feel that BOSCH is appropriating some

of the revenues for his own purposes.

On October 29, 1965, MM I-2 said it had been

established now that the BOSCH clique has not been mak-

ing an accounting for funds received or disbursed for the
