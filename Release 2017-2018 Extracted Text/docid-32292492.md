ANTIRACKETEERING

Re Bonn airtel 12/1/64.

Under date of December 22, 1964, the Bundeskriminalamt

(BKA - West German Federal Criminal Police) advised that

SUZANNE FUEGER,

accompanied by her mother, left Munich,

Germany, by Lufthansa Airlines at 12:50 P.M. December 19,

1964, en route to Zurich, Switzerland.

It will be recalled that FUEGER and her mother

traveled from Munich to the mother's home in the very small

village of Riederau on the Ammersee (a lake) south of Munich

on 11/25/64, after having made hotel reservations in Munich .

for the nights of December 17 and 18, 1964. The BKA stated

that a surveillance of FUEGER and her mother on December 18

and 19 failed to reveal any significant information and they

appeared to spend their time in Munich, Germany, in shopping.

Since FUEGER has departed from Germany and no

specific information has been received regarding any plans

of the subject to enter this area, active inquiry here is

in abeyance but this case is being kept in a pending-inactive

status as further inquiry will probably be necessary before

the subject and FUEGER return to the United States.
