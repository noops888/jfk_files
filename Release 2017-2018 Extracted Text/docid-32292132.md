DETAILS

At New Haven, Connecticut

EXISTENCE - ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP

During the past six month period, investigation in the New

Haven,

Connecticut area has

failed to reveal that there is

a particular La Cosa Nostra "family" in Connecticut, although

investigation indicates that individuals who will be named

later in this report have definite associations or tie-ins

with certain New York "families", which are in the framework

' of La Cosa Nostra.

So far as leadership is concerned, it cannot be determined

that any one individual, who is reliably reported to be a

New York "family", has direct control

over other Connecticut La Cosa Nostra members. It does

appear that members in Connecticut are largely concerned

with illegal gambling activities, from which they derive

their largest income.

RALPH "WHITEY" TROPIANO

MEMBER SHIP

It has been reported by reliable New York sources, and other

sources in New Haven, Connecticut considered reliable, that

TROPIANO is a member

of the JOSEPH ANTHONY COLOMBO "family"

formerly headed by the late JOSEPH PROFACI.

Also reliably reported by New York as a member of the same

organization is GEORGE TROPIANO, brother of RALPH TROPIANO,

residing in the Brooklyn, New York area.

During the past pertinent period, NH T-1 and NH T-2 both

have reported RALPH TROPIANO to be a member of the late JOSEPH

PROFACI "family".

On June 17, 1964, NH T-2, when questioned as to TROPIANO'S

activities, advised that

he had heard from underworld contacts

that the late JOSEPH PROFACI was the boss of TROPIANO. He also

remarked that not being Italian himself (NH T-2 is of German
