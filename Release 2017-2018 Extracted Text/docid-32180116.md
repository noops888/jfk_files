BU 248-S furnished the following:

"February 17, 1964

"On February 14, 1964, a Buffalo

Branch Workers World Party meeting was held

at 831 Main Street, Buffalo, New York.

Tea.

Baines was Chairman of the meeting. There

was no Recording Secretary or Financial

Secretary.

"Ernie Weissman gave the monthly

financial report, and reported a balance of

$133:31 was on hand at the end of January?

1964.

"Rosemary Neidenberg gave a brief

report on the trip of Admiral Perry to the

North Pole.

She

said that he was accompanied

by a Negro aide-de-camp, and that Admiral

Perry and the Negro were the only persons who

actually. planted. a

flag at the North Pole.

She said that others in the expedition party

handled supply lines and were notactually

with the Admiral-when the flag was planted.

She said that this is an example of a great

accomplishment by a Negro.

"Ed Merrill spoke on South Viet

Nam and China.

He said that China would

support North Viet Nam if the United Stutes

and South Viet Nam try to invade North Viet

Nam.

He said the United States may be

planning to take over North Viet Nam and

probably will not be satisfied to divide the

country as they did in Korea.

He said that

if the United States and South Viet Nam

invade North Viet Nam, a

may start, and that Russia, in spite of her

difficulties with China, will support China

and North Viet Nam in a

war against the

United States. He said that he doubted if

France would support the United States as

France wants to neutralize South Viet Nam.
