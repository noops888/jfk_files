INTRObUCTION

'"!

Since 1956, 'Martin Luther King, Jr., has occupied

a

prominent role in the drive for equal rights for Negroes

In the

United States. During this critical period in our Nation's

history, much has depended on him as the individual Negroes in

great numbers have looked to for leadership in their drive

to

achieve equality. Much depends on him still in these

times

when racial tensions have created, an atmosphere of fear and

foreboding among many Negroes and whites alike. The course

King chooses to follow at this critical time .could have

momentous impact on the future of race relations in the

United States, and for that reason: this paper has been prepaxed

to give some insight into the nature of the man himself as

well as the 'nature of his views, goals, objectives, tactics

and the reasons therefor.

Washington Spring xojegt

Surmany regarding do 15 53u/923

Martin Luther King, Irt, President of the Souther

Christian

Leadership/Conference, (SCLC), has stated publicly

that he and 3,000 of his followers will march on. Washington,

D. G.,

this spring.

He has announced that he will lead a massive

civil disobedience campaign that widl disrupt the normal

course of business and, in fact, close down the Nation's

Capital. He originally announced this project on August 15,

1967, in Atlanta, Georgia, on the occasion of the tenth

anniversary of the SCLC.

King predicted that this massive civil disobedience

will be more effective than riots.

Concerning civil disobedience,

King declared, "To dislocate the function of a city without

destroying it can be more effective than a riot, because it

can be longer lasting, costly to society, but not wantonly

destructive.

King has referred to this campaign as the

"Washington

Spring Project" and the "Poor People's March," which is

reportedly being staged to pressure Congress into passing

legislation favorable to the Negro.

It is King's contention

that the Government of the United States does not move until

it is confronted dramatically.

To add to the dramatic.

coming to Washington to, stay; that his followers will conduct

proposed action of the black nationalist groups which plan to

attempt to seize the initiative and escalate the nonviolent

demonstrations into violence, dr

King has met with black nationalists and attempted

to solicit their support. Stokely Carmichael of the Student

Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), an extremist Black

Nationalist organization, has conferred with King. Carmichael

endorses the objectives of King and advises he will not oppose

or interfere with the "Washington Spring Project's" plans

for

nonviolence.' However, he also states his role will be governed

by what SNCC decides.

King is aware of the possibility of violence because

one of his aides proclaimed recently to the press,"Jail will

be the safest place in Washington this spring." However, in

spite of this potentially explosive situation, King continues

his plans. He adroitly uses this possibility as a lever to

attempt to pressure Congress into action by warning that the

"Washington Spring Project" may be the last chance in this

country for

peaceful change with respect to civil rights

Strong Communist Influence

Another complicating factor in the picture is the

degree of communist influence on King. One of King's

principal advisors is Stanley David Levisons Ostensibly

only a New York City attorney

Tand businessman, Levison is,

'in fact, a shrewd, dedicated communist. Levison has spent

the major part of his life advancing communist interests:

Levison 'gravitated to Martin Luther King, Jr.,

1956. He has been as dedicated in his support of King as he

has been in advancing communist goals. He has actively

involved himself in fund-raising drives for King; served as

his legal counsel in certain matters, suggested speech

material for him, discussed with King demonstrations in

which King was involved, guided him in regard to acceptance

or rejection of various public appearances and speaking

commitments, and helped him with mattets related to articles

and books King has prepared:

: 1..

Levison edited most of the chapters of King's new

book entitled

'Where Do 'We Go From Here; Chaos Or Community?"

Levison wrote one chapter of this book and the publisher's

representative complained to King and Levison that it was

obvious certain 'sections of the book were written by different

individuals,

Stanley Levison has told Clarence Jones, another

advisor to King, that under no circumstances should King be

permitted to say anything vithout their approving it. Levison

also informed Jones that King is such a slow thinker he is

FORMATION OF SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE.

Background of Founder

Martin Luther King, Jr., was born January 15, 1929,

at Atlanta, Georgia. - His name at birth was Michael Luther

King, STo

In 1935, his first name was changed to Martin.

King received an A.Bo degree in 1948 from Morehouse College,

Atlanta, Georgia. He then entered Crozer Theological!

Seminary, Chester, Pennsylvania, where he was one of six

Negroes among 100 students. He won the Plafker Award as

the most outstanding student, was President of the Senior

Class, and received the J. Lewis Crozer Fellowship 'for !!

graduate study at the university of his choice.

King

graduated from Crozer Theological Seminary with a Bachelor

of Divinity, degree in 1951 and did graduate work at Boston

University, Boston, Massachusetts, where he secured a Ph.D.

degree in 1955.

Upon graduation, he jits offered the pastorate of

two Baptist churches in

the East and teaching posts in three

colleges. King chose the pastorate at the Dexter Avenue Baptist

Church in Montgomery, Alabama. After becoming established in

his church, he founded the Montgomery Improvement Association

and'led local Negroes in the Montgomery Bus Boycott that

attracted national attention. In March of 1957, he

founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

with himself as President. He still holds that position

today•

He

is also co-pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church,

Atlanta, Georgia.

Subversives Attracted

Stanley Levison was attracted to King and SCIC when

King: gained national attention. Levison soon developed a

close relationship with King and was known in King's group as

"Assistant Chief." In 1961, he was assistant treasurer of

SCLC®

Prior to joining forces with King, Levison led a

double life, for the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA,). Outwardly

Levison's

and O'Dell's communist affiliations.

The reason King enjoyed this close relationship with

communists i's best explained by the fact that Levison, i

Februazy, 1962, passed the word to Gus Hall, General Seecetary,

CPUSA,

"King is a whole-hearted Marxist who has studied it

(Marxism), believes in it and agrees with it, but_because of

the CPUSA as a true, genuine Marxist-Leninist. "Erom the top

of his head to the tips of his toes.

The feeling within the

CPUSA at that time was, and still is, that King definitely

follows a Marzist-Leninist line.

Communist Fixposed

King was forced to get rid of Hunter Pitts O'Dell

in October, 1962, when several newspaper articles exposed

O'Dell's connection with SCLC and his communist affiliationse

King still tried to hide O'Dell in his organization until

July, 1963, when he accepted O'Dell's "resignation." As

King put it, O'Dell's release was not because of connections

between O'Dell and the CPUSA but because of the emotional

public response in

Clarence Jones that King

commented: "King has never read

anything as badly," and, "as though he did not understand

what he was feading."

Former: Communist Advisors

Bayatd Rustin is a former advisor to King and a one-

time assistant

secretary of the SCIC.

Rustin has publicly

admitted affiliation with the communist movement in the late

1930's.

He was also one of a selected number of observers

permitted to attend the CPUSA's National Convention in 1957.

King said he had to let Rustin go because of problems arising

his homosexual activities.

Rustin has long been so inclined,

having been arrested in New York City in 1946 for offering to

I commit a lewd or indecent act. Rustin was arrested again in

Pasadena, California, in 1953, for offering to engage in an act.

III. " COMMUNIST OBJECTIVES

1' During the early 1960's, the CPUSA was striving

to obtain a Negro-labor coalition to achieve its goals in

this country. At that time, the CPUSA "Party Line" was:

"Big business attacks on the rights of labor are continuing.

In order to 'defeat this offensive, organized labor, assisted

by communists, must launch a countercrusade, which can

succeed only if it is based on the united action of the entire

trade-union movement."

-f.

Also, communisls had-recognized the error of

their ways by proclaiming that the communist program fox

"self-determination" of the Negro in the "Black Belt" area

of the South had been discarded. The new policy was to

seek complete economic, political, and social equality for

the Negro with all other American citizens. In a May, 1961,

issue, the communist newspaper, "The Worker!' stated,

"Communists will do their utmost to strengthen and unite

the Negro movement and bring to it the backing of the

working people.":

Martin' Luther King, Jx., and his organization

were made to order to achieve these objectives.: King and

his group were demonstrating and conducting voter-registration

campaigns to align the Negro movement solidly behind King.

The Peace' Issue Appears

This activity continued, with yuch fanfare until

the passage of the Civil Rights Act. of 1964 by the Congress.

This was the most far-reaching civil rights act passed

since the reconstruction era.

Now it was no longer newsworthy

to demonstrate for Negro rights.

The passage of this Act

was one factor that took King off the front pages of the

daily newspapers.!.:"

The second factor that had a bearing on King's

lack of publicity, and change of policy was the Gulf of

Tonkin incident on August 2, 1964.

Because of this, the i

United States took a more active role in the Vietnam Wak..

The CPUSA then started to demand through its propaganda:

machine that the escalation of the war in Vietnam be

stopped.

The activities in Vietnam were now more important

news than was' the Negro freedom movement.

The CPUSA also realized that even though the

peace issue was of primary importance, a secondary issue

not to be forgotten

was the freedom movement.

Abandoning

its previous

efforts to form a Negro-labor coalition,

the CPUSA now started touting a Negro-peace coalition that

would form a massive movement to force the United States

Government to change its foreign and domestic policies.

SECRET

## Page 13

"The Worker," in April, 1965, claimed that this

coalition was starting to form when it

stated, "The civil

rights movement was coming to see the identity of interests

of the Negro people's freedom movement with the anti

imperialist objective of ending the neo-colonialist war

of the' United States against the people of Vietnam."

IV. ' THE EMERGENCE OF THE PEACE ISSUE IN KING'S GROUP

i*!:

Role as a Peacemakéi

121:.

King and his aides helped form this coalition

of "peace" and "freedom" groups.

They saw an opportunity

to again propel King into the international spotlight by

proposing he make peace in Vietnam.

On August 12, 1965, King announced publicly that

he wouid appeal personally to President Ho Chi Minh of

North Vietnam to join a conference to end the Vietnam war.

He said he would also send letters th leaders of South Vietnam,

the Soviet Union, and the United. States in this regard.

This "move on the part of King was engineered by.

Bayard Rustit and Harry Wachtel. In early August they met and

"discussed how to inject King into

the Vietnam issue

It was

decided to:have King write these world leaders utilizing King's

prestige as a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. This action,

they felt, would cast an image of king as a great moral leader

and extend his influence beyond the civil rights movement.

": Subsequently, a leading newspaper sent King 12

questions to answer which would clarify his position on Vietname

Upon receipt of these questions, King referred them to Stanley

Levison to answer.

Because of the unfavorable public reaction to

King's announcement, a conference with his top advisors was

held in early September, 1965, at which time it was decided

Bayard Rustin concerning a statement for the press.

informed them that the press häd been bothering him for a

statement, but he dared not take any action until he discussed

the matter with them. It was agreed that King would say he .

called for a cessation of the bombings.

Stanley Levison and Harry

Wachtel continued to argue for a

the appropriate occasion for him to express his antiwar

sentiments.

'"Over the years a number of individuals who have

been employed at one time or another by "The Nation" in bag

editorial and writing capacities have been identified with

the communist movement.

Riverside Church Speech

In early April, 1967, King accepted an invitation to

speak. before the group, "Clergy and Laymen Concerned About

Vietnamy' This is an interdenominationa

committee formed

• to mobilize religious opinion against

the war

Prior to this speech, king and Andrew Young, Executive

Director of SCLC, spent approximately eight houzs in conference

Stanley Levison

and Harry Wachtel were present at this conference

:. Later that same day, King spoke at the Riverside

Church, 'New York, New York, before this group, at which time

he was highly critical of the United States involvement in

the Vietnam War''" He referred to the United States Government

as "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today." He

proposed a five-step process to extricate the United States

from this conflict.

Comments in the news media coverage of King's

remarks pointed out'that the five points are similar in concept

to the conditions imposed by North Vietnam as a prerequisite

to negotiations.: 'It is interesting to note that King's

proposals parallel the propaganda line which the Communist

Party, USA, has been projecting regarding the war in Vietnam.

This group subsequently changed its name to Spelne,

Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam.

Reverend

James Bevel, on leave from the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference,

was appointed Executive Director of this Comnittee.

On April 13, 1967, Levison and King were in contact

to discuss the progress Levison was making in the wilting of

the speech King was to deliver on April 15, 1967,

to a rally

of the Spring Mobilization Conmittee at the United Nations.

Levison discussed part of the speech which King enthusiastically

accepted.

King particulariy liked the part indicating that

the United States should unilaterally withdrar from Vietnan.

He also enjoyed the part where he would appeal to the country

to "demand insistently that our Governmentihonor Hanol's

promise to negotiate if the bombligs cease.!

The CPUSA was delighted with King's actlons in

this regard. The recognized leader of 22 million Negroes

had openly attacked his country's palicy in Vietnam.

He

participated in the largest rally ever staged against the

Vietnam war by being the keynote speaker. In his speech

King again called for the withdrawal of United States troops

from Vietnam.

' King was helping the CPUSA achieve its goal

of uniting the Negro movement with the peace Issue.

"The Worker" expressed the CPUSA's pleasure in

the May 7, 1967, issue where it stated in part, "When

Dr. King insists upon the connection between aggressive

foreign policy and regressive domestic policy he insists

upon what is true and consequential. When Di. King points:

the struggle against jim crow, must be--and is--a leader

in the struggle against war."

Being the astute advisor he is, and to keep

• King

from being openly aligned with the CPUSA, Levison advised

King to align himself with those individuals who have I.

power'rather than be aligned with a fringe antivar element.

He was to make the new alignment after his April 15, 1967,

speech.

The fringe element Levison referred to was

According to Wachtel, a pacifist group was meeting that day

in an effort to get king to agree, to run for President with

Dr. Benjamin Spock, the antiwar agitator, as his Vice

Presidential candidate. Both Levison and Wachtel agreed

that it was too early and that King should not agree to run

at this

s time. a

The CPUSA again seized the opportunity to cause

dissension and unrest in the country by announcing they would

support king, and Spock on a peace ticket.

At a May Day, 1967,

program in Berkeley, Califocnia, Gus Hall stated, "The Party

forces should begin work right now to elect these two men

because they

are for peace in Vietnam."

Early in May, 1967, Levison was still concerned

with King's being

identified with the peace movement rather

than '

civil rights. When approached by peace groups attempting

to get King'to continue to run. for President, Levison Informed

those representatives that King would talk. on

King's Mistress

".!'

It was learned in February, 1968, from a very

responsible Los Angeles individual in a position to know, that

King has been having an illicit love affair with the wife of

a prominent Negro dentist in Los Angeles, California,

i since

1962.' He believes King fathered a baby girl born to this

woman inasmuch as her; husband is allegedly sterile.

The child resembles King to a great degree and King

contributes, to the support of this child. He calls this

woman every Wednesday and frequently meets her in various

cities throughout the country.

The individual who reported this is himself'

prominent Negro who is related by law to King's mistress.

He

advised he has known King since 1960 and refers to him as

"hypocrite."

He also reported that king is having itticit

love affairs with three other women, one of whom is Joan.

Baez, the nationally known folk singer.-

The prominent

Negro who furnished the information said he was appalled that

a man of King's. low character could cause so much trouble for

both Negroes and the Government. • :

wAs can be seen from the above,

it is a fact that

King not only regularly indulges in adulterous acts but enjoys

the abnormal by engaging in group sexual orgies..

King's Histörical Aspect

• These facts about the Nobel Peace Prize winner make

his remarks seem incongruous when he replied after winning

this cherished award, "History has thrust me into this

position.:: It would both be immoral and a sign of ingratitude

•if I did not face my moral responsibility to do what I can in

the civil rights

struggle."
