ANTI-RACKETEERING

BoBuairtel 2/1/60 and your airtel 2/4/60.

Your suggestion that a

microphone-telephone type

of installation be employed in connection with this proposed

surveillance is not approved.

While the laboratory is of the

opinion this type of installation will bo technically

feasible, it would, in effect, constitute a telephone tap

which would intercept telephone conversations and for that

reason is not being approved.

In the event future circumstances indicato the

desirability of considering an alternate type of installation,

you should advise Bureau, furnishing your recommendationg.

NOTE

Pittsburgh ascertained that a cottage is under

construction in a remote suburban area approximately 25 miles

northeast of Pittsburgh, Pa., and 8 miles from New Kensington, Pa.

An informant has advised that this cottage, when completed, will be

utilized by Gabriel Mannarino, Pittsburgh top hoodlum. He has

also advised hoodlums from the Pittsburgh area and from other parts

of the country will probably utilize this cottage as a meeting

place. Pittsburgh recommended that the premises be surveyed to

determine if special coverage could

be installed.

Pursuant to Bureau authority, this survey was completed

• and Pittsburgh recommended installation of a radio-microphone type

of equipment.

This was considered by the Laboratory which concluded

that type of equipment is feasible ily fof short term

installations

Reurlet 1/25/80, captioned as above setting forth details of MISUR

survey at subject's cottage.

The various aspects of providing MISUR coverage under the peculiar

conditions presented by this case have been considered. The presentation

of the survey material submitted is excellent reflecting thoroughness in the

survey and detail in the proposed installation.

From the installation standpoint, the radio-microphone installation

recommended may be teasible; however, other technical factors rule out

the use of radio-microphone equipment in proposed installation. This type

equipment is suitable only for short term installations where operation for

a lew days or a week or two may be expected to provide the desired coverage.

Radio-microphone equipment is not designed for continuous operation over

longer periods of time and it must be expected that extended periods of

operation will result in fatlure of transmitter tubes or other components.

Control equipment suggested to provide intermittent operation of transmitter

would not eliminate this problem since control equipment would be in

continuous operation and therefore would be subject to failure.

It appears that two possibilities exist whereby MISUR coverage

of this residence may be effected by operation of microphone over wires.

These may have already been evaluated by you and discarded in favor of

the proposed radio-microphone installation.

RE: GABRIEL MANNARINO

92-2914

MISUR coverage of subject's cottage very desirable, it is requested that

you provide Bureau with comments and observations regarding possibility

of MISUR coverage along following lines:

1. Should telephone service be requested it may be

possible to operate a Single Pair Microphone-

Telephone (SPMT). The BPMT unit may also be

(S)

used to operate one or two microphones or MOUSE

units on the subscriber's telephone wire without

additional wires. Microphones could be installed

prior to occupancy of the cottage and leads

connected to telephone lines when telephone service

is established. Operation of SPMT unit requires (O

that the subscriber's line be rooped through the

monitoring point which must be located somewhere

between the subscriber's telephone instrument and

the telephone company central office. Section 26,

Part 1, Handbook of Technical Equipment sets

forth details of this equipment and technical

considerations necessary for

SPMT operation.

2: The possibility of using underground wires for

microphone egress is a possibility in this case.

It may be possible to follow the route of the water

or sewer lines in the immediate vicinity of the

cottage andthen route the underground cable to

telephone company pole where connections can be

made to telephone wires leading to a plant. Security

of wire laying operations and terrain conditions will

largely determine whether underground wire can be

laid to a suitable point for connection to overhead

telephone wires.

It is desired that any additional survey necessary be conducted to

evaluate these possibilities for MISUR coverage, and that the Bureau be

advised without delay whether either approach in this MISUR installation

appears to be feasible.

DATE 4/2/94:x5608 560801 GAT

JFK

Pursuant to Bureau authority dated 12/31/59 a survey

has

been completed to determine the feasibility of installing

a misur at a cottage owned by the subject.

1318

All known ways and means of establishing such a misur have

been carefully considered. After taking all aspects of

the problem into consideration, it appears that a radio-

microphone installation is feasible and is the most logical

choice under the somewhat peculiar conditions presented

by this case.

This choice was made in view of the following

factors relating to technical problems, security considerations

and investigative advantages:

(1) It is recognized that the use of telephone wiring

disguises

are generally considered more secure than

the use of radio-microphone techniques.

In this case,

however, telephone disguises do not appear to be available

because of the following:

TA) No telephone service has been installed in

Orynear the cottage and no request for such

sefyice has

been made.

(B)'Although telephone service may eventually

be requested, the local independent telephone

company, which will service this cottage, uses

"wisted-pair" drop-line exclusively. According

33

to the telephone company source, the use of any

other type of drop-line would be noticed and

considered unusual by telephone company employees.

This precludes the use of disguised parallel-drop

which is available and appears to make it very

difficult, if not impossible, to carry an extra

line'into the cottage via telephone wiring.

There is a 3e foot deep crawl space under most of the

cottage.

The floor is of 3/4 inch plyboard and is

covered

with heavy carpeting. The cottage has no attic

space since the roof and interior ceiling run parallel to

one another at all points and are separated only by a 4" insulated

space.

The interior walls are of mahogany panelling.

Approximately

14 inches from the wall-ceiling junction, a 4 inch wide

white painted decorative molding extends around certain

of the interior walls (noted on Figure 5) •

Separate pieces

of panelling (about 14 inches by 36 inches) have been

used above the molding and it appears that these can be

removed without disturbing the molding or the lower portions

of the panels. Around certain of the walls in the dining-

at the same height as the molding, a 14 inch

by 20 inch hollow boxing has been constructed to provide

concealment for heating ducts, plumbing and electrical

wiring (noted on Figures 3 and 5).

PROPOSED INSTALLATION

It is proposed that three microphones and two transmitters

be installed in the manner and location illustrated in

Figure 5.

First choice is indicated in red-- second choice

in green.

The small panels above the molding

can be

installed behind as illustrated in Figure 4. Microphone No. 3

can be imbedded in the upper surface of a ledge extending

microphones. No. l and No. 2 can be securely hidden behind

the molding and will be completely hidden from view even

on close inspection. The lead wire for microphone No. 3

will be in parallel with microphone No. 2.

Certain portions

of the lead wires will extend through the hollow boxing.

The top of this boxing is about 7e ft. above the floor and

the interior is accessible only from the top.

The top is

covered with 1 inch by 12 inch boards.

As illustrated, certain

portions of this boxing will be used to carry the lead wires.

All lead wires extending through this boxing will be disguised

as Romex cable even though the chances of any subject in-

specting this boxing is very slight.

Position No. 4 is the proposed location of the transmitters.

This position is within a portion of the boxing on the east

side of the kitchen. 117 v. ac. is readily available within

this boxing. It is anticipated that the transmitters can

be mounted in a wood or metal box and marked "automatic

pressure regulating device for water system." (The cottage

is provided with its own water system.

The pump and

compressor are located under one of the kitchen cabinets in

the northeast corner of the kitchen.) The antennae can be

disguised as pieces of Romex cable.

After this equipment is

installed, It is planned that the 1 inch by 12 inch cover

boards will be nailed in place.

In the alternate location (green on Figure 5) the transmitters

would be located in a space above the low ceiling of the

shower stall. Access to this space would be gained by

removing the small panels mentioned previously.

Alternate

microphone No. 2 would be located in the base of a light

fixture mounted on the boxing.

Two transmitters are proposed in order that coverage will

continue if one should fail and in order that selective

coverage may be had within the cottage.

Investigation and observation reflecto that it is practical

and secure to mount the receiving equipment on a telephone

pole in the near vicinity of the cottage..

Actelephone line

and 117 v. ac. can be terminated on the pole. The telephone

line would, of course, terminate in either a local plant

or the Pittsburgh consolidated plant.

The equipment can

be mounted in the weatherproof box which can be locked. The

box would be marked "Experimental telephone carrier system

equipment." The receiving antennae can extend along the

pole and can be disguised as ground wires. It should be

possible for the personnel at the monitoring position to

select the output of either transmitter.

Figure 6 illustrates two telephone poles in the vicinity

of the cottage where both power and a

telephone line can

be terminated.

The distances of these poles from

ASSEMBLY OF EQUIPMENT AND TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS.

If this proposed installation is approved, it is respectfully

requested that the Laboratory assemble the necessary trans-

mitting and receiving-remote control equipment in accordance

with the following specifications:

The transmitters should be as small, as stable and as trouble-

free as possible.

Selection of the transmitter frequencies will

be left to the Laboratory.

The output power should, of course,

reception

at the receiving site, (600 yard range). Care should, of course,

be taken to prevent any harmonic radiations in amateur

broadcast or television bands.

The power consumption and

the heat generated by the equipment should be as low as

possible.

It is anticipated that Knowles 50 ohm microphones

will be used.

As was previously stated,

it is anticipated

that microphones 2 and 3 will be in parallel. The equip-

ment should be mounted in a suitable wood or metal box

with Romex fittings attached for power input, audio input

and antennae output.

The size or the power consumption of the receiving equipment

is not critical.

This equipment will be available for

servicing.

Through the use of direct current impulses

originating at the monitoring end of the telephone line it

should be possible to energize a relay at the receiving

point which would select the output of either transmitter.

It should be possible to control the audio output level

of the receiving equipment. This equipment should be

mounted in a suitable waterproof box with a lock.

Pittsburgh presently possesses one Knowles 50 ohm micro-

-phone.

Two additional microphones are needed. All other

supplies will be obtained locally.

Much of the microphone lead wire will run parallel to a.c.

house wiring.

The Laboratory's opinion regarding

the

advisability of using shielded lead wire is requested.

SECURITY OF INSTALLATION

It is anticipated that the installation personnel will enter

the cottage under the pretext of being workmen. ' Suitable

props will be used to justify this pretext. Prior to any

entrance into the cottage, all logical subjects who might

enter the cottage will be placed under surveillance and

will be surveilled during the entire operation.

Special

Agent personnel who are well acquainted with all logical

subjects will be placed at either end of the roaa

and will provide additional warning of any possible approach

will occur but every precaution will be taken to prevent

any possibility of compromise.

COSTS

The telephone company source will place 117 v. a.c. on

the selected telephone pole for a maximum charge of $20.00.

There is a $2.00 per month minimum charge for power used.

A leased line from Leechburg to Pittsburgh will cost a

maximum of $85.00 per month.

It is believed that superior overall results would be

obtained if the receiving equipment could be monitored

in the vicinity of Leechburg.

It is realized that the

cost of maintaining a plant and monitoring personnel at

Leechburg would greatly exceed the cost of monitoring
