PCI JOE ELLIS VANSCOY, OKlahoma CIty bookmaker,

was engaged during the past football season and part of

current basketball season in bookmaking operation with

GEORGE EDWARD BARNES at the Penn Club in Logan County,

Oklahoma, just outside city limits of Oklahoma City.

FRANCIS LEROY WILLS was employed for awhile by BARNES as

a collector, but was fired by BARNes when wilhs showed

up drunk for work.

BARNES is known acquaintance of

RUSSELL D. MATTHEWS.

On 1/19/68, PCI VANSCOY advised SA HOWARD CECIL

he and WILLS formerly called R. D. MATTHEWS in Garland,

Texas,

every other day for line information; however,

VANSCOY has not contacted MATTHEWS since MATTHEWS was

raided in Garland (9/29/67) â€¢

On 2/15/67, PCI advised that MATTHEWS reportedly

gets his line information from Las Vegas, Nevada, for $250

per week. MATTHEWS once told PCI he was

angry because he

had

been

furnished "upside down" line by the Las Vegas

source and lost money because the odds were wrong.

Based on the above information, Dallas, by letter

dated 3/15/68, requested Oklahoma City to interview vANscoY

and WILLS as to more specifics, such as times of calls to

MATTHEWS,

telephones used in Oklahoma from which calls

made, and if determined to try and verify such calls through

tolt

records,
