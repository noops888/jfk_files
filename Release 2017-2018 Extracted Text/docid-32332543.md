the proposed substitution, one of instant electric blasting

Re Miami airtel to Bureau dated 4/27/73, with

IHM attached which indicated that BOSCH is making

preparations to resume terrorist activities in the

near cucure.

He has become associated with MAX LESNICK,

publisher of "Replica", Spanish-language newspaper in

Miami, who has, along with City Commissioner MANOLO

REBOSO, made charges recently to this office, other

agencies and individuals, alleging that RICARDO MORALES

NAVARRETE, head of the 'Cuban Mafia" operates under the

protection of the FBI and other agencies. An attempt

was made on the night of 5/25/73, to assassinate MORALES

and he identified one of his asailants as MANUEL CURA,

who is a known associate of LESNICK. MORALES, in 1968,

testified for the FBI in the bombing case against BOSCH

and 8 co-defendants, which resulted in their convictions.

BOSCH and several other members of his organization

have been feleased from prison and are back in Miami.

noted that these detonators were contained in a box

Examination of these detonators reflects that

each had a copper colored cap 1 1/8 inch long, connected

to one red colored enamel wire and one gold colorad

enamel wire. (4 /(4)

Through the cooperation of MM 3142-PSI,

Miami is in a position to substitute dummy detonators for

of the possibility that BOSCH will come to him as a source

It is requested that the FBI Laboratory immediately

instruct the Baltimore Office to immediately contact

DuPont at Wilmington, Delaware, in order to obtain a supply

of at least 50 dumny electrical detonators answering the

description of those above described. (XU)

It is also requested that a supply of dummy
