Justice Department Request for Mail Information

Jeanne Davis transmitted to me a request from the Department of Justice to

survey 40 Committee and predecessor group files to determine any information

of a list of subjects focused on operations involving mail. She asked that I

transmit my findings directly to you..

I assume that Justice is interested in illegal use of the mails. As I understand

CIA's admitted activity in this field, it was an intelligence collection operation

and therefore would not be subject to review by the 40 Committee or its

predecessors. We find no record that mail intercept operations were discussed

by the 40. Committee or predecessors; however, there are references to mail

operations in Committee records.

Jeanne Davis said Justice wanted material on "any use of mail techniques."

These are representative items:

TAB A--Reports which indicate general mailings of propaganda and

related material. There is nothing sinister in this--you put a book

or pamphlet in an envelope, address it, put on postage and drop it in

the mail.

TAB B-- Letters were test mailed inside a denied area to see if they

come out, or individuals mailed spontaneous letters to CIA-supported

enterprises. Again, there is nothing unusual about this--regular use

of the mail system.

TAB C-- Special covert operations which make use of the mails, including:

C-1-- A forged letter mailed in

C-2--Mailing of

However (see page 5 of 9 May 1972 item), some of these letters

may have been inserted into the mail system ostensibly as having

originated in the denied

area.

C-3--Some covert operations using the mail may have been designed

Note that the last item in this group (17 and

10 January 1972) refers to "letter-insert mechanisms." I can find

no elaboration of what this means, but it might represent intercept

of the mail,

C-4--National Intelligence Estimates and other reports of intelligence

may refer to information, some part of which was gleaned from mail

intercepts. On the basis of protecting sources and methods these

would not normally be identified in a document. However if the

question were asked at a meeting, the source might be orally identified

as a mail intercept (or SIGINT or whatever).

C-5-- This category represents /

sending letters ostensibly from groups in North Vietnam to other

countries. The second shows

In each of the C-j cases, operational information was probably gleaned

from a mail intercept operation which would enable one to

The material might then

C-6-- Here are two cases where the Committee was informed that mail

intercepts were the source of information used in support of covert

operations.

With regard to MONGOOSE files--which Mrs. Davis said Justice also wanted us

to check--I find only the references at TAB D which suggest the possibility that

mail intercept operations were a part of the response to intense pressures for

more "hard" information on what was going on in Cuba.

Mrs. Davis also said that Justice made reference to Walt Rostow's recollection

of a general survey of all "intelligence programs country by country" made by

the 303 Committee. I assume he means the general beginning-of-a-new-

President's-term roundup (similar to the ones given Mr. Nixon and Mr. Ford).

We find references to covert action reviews, but these appear to have been oral

and we find nothing in writing, and no references to mail operations.

In summary, we have made a review of our files, with special reference to the

general index of minutes and the country files deemed most likely to include

references to "any use of mail techniques." Representative findings are cited

above.

We find no record of "illegal" mail operations being a subject of dis-

cussion or consideration within the 40 Committee and predecessor organizations

(December 1958 to the present). However, there is evidence that the Committee

was informed that mail intercept operations were conducted (TAB C-6).

Please

advise if any additional material or presentation is desired.
