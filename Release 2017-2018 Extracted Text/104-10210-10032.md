server and consuitant, and he personally questioned NOSENKO during

July and august igc5 concerning certair aspects of his personal

past and early kO3 career.

tember 1953.

b. DERYASIN'S Conments

The following statements by DERYA!IN are based on his question-

ing of NOSENKO botween 26 July and 13 August 1965.

The questions

asked an the statements attricuted to NOSENKO (referred to as

Sucject)

hithoto! the joviet State Sceu-

rity Service did not become kevin

as the KGB until March 1954,

this term is used for convenience

sake, excopt where the specific

organization of the Mob or MiD 1s under discussion. DERYAGIN'S

comments follod:

"NOSENKO's Acceptance into State Security*

"Taking NOSENKO's own statements at face value,

it is highly

improbable that a person

nas descrived hinself to be

would be acceptable

for a position is a staff officer in State

Security. The following factors are important in this regard:

It was the policy of State Security to avoid hiring

the children of high goverr..ent officials.

D.

Until, STALIN's death ir. March 1953, KOBULOV, the

man who supposedly helped NOSEKO guin intrance irto the

service, had no influence inside the loB apparatus.

about 1948 until 9 or 10 March 1952, XOBULOV nad no office

inside the MGB or the MVD huildings.

in these years KOBULOV worked in Germany as Daputy Chief of

the GUSIMZ (Chief Directorate of joviet Properties Abroad) **

which was once directly under the Council of Ministers and

later under the Ministry of Forsign Trade.

The office was

located on Chkalova Street, near the Kurskiy Railroad

Station (three biocks from my former avartnert).

* See also Part V.B.

** WISMUT A.G. in Germany was subordinate to GUSINZ; for a

further discussion of KOBULOV's role in helping NOSENKO

join the NG3, see Part V.B.

c. It was physically impossible at the time for "CSEvio

to be recommended for and

accepted into State Sscurity, as he

has told us, all an one month,

March 1953.

lif one accepts

his earlier

version that he had his talk with KOBUlov in Jan-

uary or february, his ascount is similarly impossible because

KOBULOV was not then in State Gecurity.

It would normally

have taken a mich longer time, bit in addition to this it was

a period of reorganization and the personnel staff was rot

actively conducting their work it that time, aro permesent

stalf officers were not sure that they would

d. In Warch 1953 NOSE EO was lready twenty-five ard a

half years old and orly a merter of the fonsorol.

He had no

reconnendation for Party membelshin are could rot beconc a

menüar for i full icar cecause of his transier frot. one ser-

vice (GRU, to another.

1t is impossible that State security

would accept hin krowing in advance that on his birthday re

would be trenty-six yeurs old and vithout rither Komsonol or

Party membership. Even for the son of a Minister, the Secze-

tary of the Konsorol Committee of the kGs would have to talk

with the fersonnel Office and would not cive a recommendation

for his acceptance, especially for tre Interral Counterintel-

ligence (Securd chief) Directorate.

in the

case of a son

of

a Minister and one dho 18 recommendra by KOBULOV, the secre-

tary would request from NOSENKO i recormerdation for Party

membership from the merbers of the Cornunist Party where

NOSENKO used to work, in this case the GPU.

In this way the

secretary of

the Konsomol would be sure himself that NOSENKO

would become a candidate member of the Communist Party during

the next year.

"Horever, even accepting that despite these obstacles and

contradictions the KGB

would have accepted him,

ore must also

remember (according to NOSPNKO's own statements) that NOSEiKO'S

file contained the following negative points.*

They are serious

factors and certain of them alone would be enough to cause the

rejection; the totality makes it difticult to believe that at a

State Security organs anyone would take the

responsibility of accepting him:

Subject was already marrird and divorced before entry

into State Security.

He haû been married to General TELEGIN's daughter

and TELSSIN had been arrested by State Security and was in

jail the day that Subject entered State Security.

c.

NOSENKO said that there was a file on NOSENKO's

father in which compromising material was collested on

of his acceptance

Subject never completed high school in the normal

Subject was a poor student at tre Institute of Irter-

national Relations.

h. It should be adied that the iGu dold definitely

know that: NosE:o was involved in an

ancomobile accident

in 1947 and was interrogated by the Militia (traffic court),

found guilty, and fired.

This would definitely play a

negative role in NoSEko's admission to

the KG.

recovered from luberculoyis.*

In fact, there was a rule

"In addition,

after acceptance, the fact that KoBtlOV was a

personal frierd of Subject's father,

as he has told us, would

have teen noted in the file and would have played a regative role

in permitting Subject to continue to work in State Security after

KOBULOV'S arrest in June 1953.

"I asked Subject how he answered some of the questions in the

anketa (entry questionaire), particularly the questions on his

former wife, her relatives, and on his mother's ancestry.**

in 1953 during the confusion and changes after the death of StALIN.

Subiect ainitted that the question was logical, and said that he

could only assume that the enfluence

and influential position of his own father ortweighei these rega-

tive factors.

le also cited his GRU experience in this connectior.

"I then asked Subject how he had reported his second marriage

to the KGB.

He replied that before the marriage he had mentioned

* NOSTKO first mertioned having had tuberculosis during the June

1962 meetings, when he described it as a minor case but said he

was under out-patient treatment until 195e.

He next mentioned

his illness in

1966, describing how he sometimes coughed up a

"alass of blood" at a time. Although DERYABIN's questioning

covered this part of NOSENKO's life in detail, there was no

nention of tuberculosis in July and August 1965.

1954, and if so, what grounds

there could have been for retaining him in the isil.

that he thought that his file probably was revirved but that

again the influence of his father had save him.

Subject added

that another important factor was prorably his language qualifi-

cation and particularly his hicher caucation.

I pointed out to

Subject that if his second wife and hor parents had heen abroad

it was impossible that her name check could have bren negative.

He admitted it was illogical, but insisted that this was so.

viously giver. varying dates for his entry on dury in the KCo.

NOSENKO stuck to this

even when told he was wrong; he did not say he did not know or

did not rementer, perhaps realizing that he could not claim not

to remember what directorate he served in.

( Actually, the change

in numerical designationg

was instituted by BERIYA right after

STALIN'S death in March 1953 and persisted until the KGB was

organized ir. March 1954.

Thus, NOSENiO does not know what the

correct designation of his own directorate was at the time that

he allegedly entered on duty with Soviet State Security and for

the entire first year of his alleged service there.

* NOSENKO on other occasions has given various reasons why he

told CiA that he joined the KuB in 1952. See Part V.B.

He asserts that POZHENko's office, whish tos-

EliKO visited several times in early 1953, was located on the 5th

flour, 8th entry, Building No. 12,

Szerzhinakiy Street.

In fact,

neither ROZHENKO

nor any officers or units of

the Personnel De-

partment were located in the Bch ertry.

They were all (including

RUSHENKO) located on the oth and 7th floors of the lth entry os

Building lio. 12.*

"Rank Pay:

hoked about his salary when he first started to

work ir the

KGB, NOSENKO said he got a basic salary of 1700 rubles

as a case officer, 500 rubles

for his rank of lieutenant, plus

secrecy, language, ard longevity pay:

Iin insisted that this was

correct, even when told that KS3

officers were ro longer being

paid for rank in March 1953, and said that although he remembersa

that there das che year--i954-nher they were not paid for rank.

he was sure that when

he first onurred or. duty he received this

pay.

Salary for rank

was taken away from State Security officers

in September 1952 ard was not restored until April 1354.

"Promotion to Senior Lieutenant: In giving the chronology

of his promotion to various military raris, NOSENKO claimed to

have keen promoted to senior lieutenant in April 1953, shortly

after joinirg the kGB.

Told tha: this was impossible, and that

no one in the KGB was promoted at this time, NOSENKO replied that

he couldn't say about anyone else but he was sure that he had re-

ceived his promotion at that time.

In fact, this is impossible:

all promotions in the KGB were frozen fron

the time BERIYA took

over as minister (March 1953) until late 1953.

"Visitor': Fass Procedures:

In talking about his first visit

to the KGB to prosess for employment, NOSEKo was unable to re-

call the procedures employed by the KGB Pass Office in issuing

visitor's passes.

Specifically, he maintained that the name of

the interviewer was not indicated on the päss.

In fact, the

name of the interviewer did appear on the pass and the inter-

viener had full responsibility for the visitor while he was on

Nhile it is understandable that NOSENKO might

have forgotten the details involved if he had only visited there

a fer times more than ten years ago,

if he worked at KGB Head-

quarters for over ten years as a

staff officer and particularly

as a supervisor he would have frequent occasion to admit visitors,

and thus should know visitor's pass procedures quite well.

**OSTRO has since said that he spoke to ro personnel officers

prior to acceptance by the iGs or afterwards, thereby indicatig

that his statements to DERYABIN were untrue.

"NOSENKO insisted that in 1953-54, the maximum age for a Kem-

1n actual fact, the maximin age was 26 (it

was raised later).

This point is important, bott because NOSEt

because it refutes his story that he has excluded from the Kon-

regard to what NOSENKO has said about

stated: "Asked to describe how he conducted name checks on a

Soviet citizen and on a new arrival to the American Embassy 1n

1953-54, NOSEiKO gave a superficial descripizon of how such

checks were done.

However, he resisted every attempt to get him

to Jescribe this

process in derail, and he made several blunders

which show that he never

actually ran such a check himself.

he did not know

where the records of all Soviet citizens

Who have been tried are kept,

and he attempted to improvise in

ansver (completely wrong) that they would check with the Militia

ROSENKO correctly said that Archives were located

on Kirov Street, but he was completoly unable to stretch

limited knowledge to provide a descriptior. of now these various

repositories were actually checkad.

NOSEiKO was also asked to

describe in detail how he ran such a check on a Soviet citizen

in the 1956-59 period.

"NOSENKO states that he knows nothing about the files of

the First Chief Directorate.

It is unbelievable that in ten

years of service in the Second Chief Directorate NOSEIKO never

a First Chief Directorate file; how else would ne be able

to check information on foreigners, especially on merican ain-

pessy personnel?

The first stage in such a check is an inquiry

: the First Chief Directorate

and a check of any files they

may have on the subject.

According to his

own account, NOSENKO

should have been doing this type of thing the whole

of his ten

years of service, without regard to wiether he was

the Anerican Department or the Ipurist Department."
