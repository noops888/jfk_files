MEMORANDUM FOR: Anthony A. Lapham

FROM

SUBJECT

: A. R. Cinquegrana

Office of General Counsel

: BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE Soft File Review - "Kelly" -

Dimitrov, D.A.

1. I have been reviewing summary sheets prepared by the Office of

Security concerning several hundred soft files on individuals associated,

or considered for association, in some way with the Agency's BLUEBIRD/

ARTICHOKE activities. In the course of that review I came upon the follow-

ing case which I discussed with Dick Lansdale and which we agreed should

be brought to your attention for your information and whatever action you

may deem appropriate.

2. As is indicated in the attached copy of the soft file summary and

the 27 January 1952 memorandum upon which it is based, D. A. Dimitrov,

designated "Kelly," is a Bulgarian expatriate who appears to have been

imprisoned in Greece some time in 1950 and 1951 on false pretenses because

the Agency feared he would accept an offer from French Intelligence. After

six months in custody, he was flown to Panama where he was misrepresented

as a psychopath and confined in a U.S. Military Hospital for several months.

The official security file shows he was then removed from the hospital and

held by the Agency at Fort Clayton in Panama for three years. He was then

returned to Greece and ultimately allowed to enter the U.S. as a refugee.

It appears from the attached copy of a 7 February 1952 memorandum that.

the "Artichoke approach," i.e., the use of drugs to reverse his hostility

toward the U.S. and U.S. intelligence agencies, was never consummated.

3. This man has had several contacts with the Agency since coming

to the U.S. In 1961 an Assistant to the DCI was contacted by a representative

of Parade magazine who had been informed by Dimitrov of his confinement

by the Agency. The Office of Security responded to the effect that this man

was disreputable, unreliable, and full of wild stories about ClA. As you

will note from the attached transcript of an 8 September interview on Good

Morning America, Mr. Dimitrov (now General Dimitrov and known as General

Donald A. Donaldson) apparently is alive and alleging that he knows who

ordered the assassination of President Kennedy.

4. Based solely upon the soft file summary, and prior to reviewing

the official security file from which I extracted the additional details, it

appeared to me that the nature of the Agency's treatment of Dimitrov might

be something which should be brought to the attention of appropriate

officials both within and outside the Agency. The fact that he is still

active and is making allegations connected with the Kennedy assassination

may add yet another dimension to this story.

I. Soft File Summary

1. Title of File: Kelly

2.

Brief Biographic Data: Kelly's true name is

DIMITROV, a 29-year-old Bulgarian who was head of

a small political party based in Greece and

ostensibly working

for Bulgarian independence.

3.

Nature of Relationship/Interest:. It was learned

that French Intelligence Service was attempting

to bribe KELLY and make him a double agent and

Kelly appeared to be interested in the French offers.

Accordingly, a plan was made to have KELLY believe

that he was

going to be assassinated and for protec-

tion he was placed in custody of the Greek police

who then put him in prison.

prison for six months until the Greek authorities

decided that KELLY was was a nuisance and they told

our people to take him back. He was then flown to

Panama where; through arrangement, he was placed in

a U. S. military hospital as a psychopathic patient.

According

to the 25 January 1952 memorandum, KELLY

had been in the hospital for several months

and the

hospital authorities want him out since he is causing

He is not a psychopathic personality.

Because of his confinement in a Greek prison and his

Stay in a military hospital, KELLy became very hostile

toward the United States and our intelligence opera-

tions in particular.

OPC was considering an "ARTICHOKE" approach to KELLY

to see if it would be possible to reorient KELLY

favorably toward us.

However, OPC advised on

• February 1952 that some opposition had arisen in

the top level of OPC to the handling of the KELLY

case in the manner that had been proposed.

Since

this opposition had arisen, nothing would

be done

to the KELLY case.

Office of Security File Summary - DIMITROV, Dimitre

Adamov (lyle 0. Kelly) (QKSTAIR) (SHAM/BGCONVOY)

#46165

1. Short Summary of Agency Interest/Use:

The file was opened in October 1950, when DIMITROV

was of operational interest to the Agency while

employed for Radio Athens in Greece.

Previously,

DIMITROV had fled from Bulgaria in

• July 1947. As

of October 1951, DIMITROV was in a hospital in

South America,

apparently under Agency

auspices.

In 1956 DIMITROV was brought to the United States,

apparently after returning to Athens from South

America,

and the Agency made no further operational

use of DIMITROV. In June 1960 DIMITROV [under case

#33259--Dimiter DIMITROFF ("Diko")] had contact

with the Contact Division outlining his background,

claiming financial difficulties, and requesting the

Agency back his plans for covert activity against

Bulgaria.

The Agency apparently took no action in

this regard.

During this contact DIMITROV claimed

that circa 1951 he was held in a hospital/cell in

Panama City.

other patients, etc.

Kelly is not a psychopathic parsonality.

explained that they can dispose of Kelly by tha simle

process of sending him to a friend of his in Caracas, Venezuela, and

as far as they are concerned, that type of disposal is perfectly o.k.

Honever, because of his conficenent in a Greek prison and his stay in

a military hospital, Kelly has become vary hostile tonard the United

with a possibllity that Dr. Ecka and Mike Gladych will carry out the

operation presumably at the military hospital in Panamas. Also in-

Coment:

This particular operation was mentioned in general terms to the

writer by Mr. Walter Driscoll approximately thirty days ago on an in-

formal basis but no significant details wers given at this tine.

While the technique that Ecke and Gladych are considering for uso

in this cass is not known to the writer, the writer beliaves the approach

will be made through tha standard narco-hypnosis techniqua. Re-conditioning

and re-orienting an individual in such a matter, in the opinion oi tho

writer, cannot be accomplished easily and will require a great deal of

tine and the & fact that an interpreter is necessary in the case con-

plicates it considerably more. It is also believed that with our present i

knowledge, we would have no absolute guarantee that the subject in this

case would maintain a positive friendly attitude toward us even though

there is apparently a successiul response to the treatment. The writer

did not suggast tol

that perhaps a total amnesia could be created

VILLAM ALTMANS: My new source is General Donald A. Donaldso

as to The

ALTMANS: Exactly: Exactly.

CLARK:

So he is not saying that he knows the man sho

gave the order in 1963 to commit the assassination.

ALTMANS:: That, according to the General, Is the same

- the

same

.person.. It's the sama group. There Is no differenco

between 162 and !63. As a matter of fact, he maintains that Pre

sident Kennedy was.

him by Soviet

and

he claims that he was called In by

John. F.

ex-President Roosevelt. He was

called In by John F. Kennedy to

was discovered against the life of Pre-

to assist- in the Investigation to unravel this, to take counter-

measures against this plot. And of course they falled.
