Re New Orleans airtel to Bureau dated 4/13/61,

and Bureau letter dated 4/12/61.

On 4/24/61, PCI BETTY PARENT advised SA WARREN C.

deBRUEYS as follows:

She alleges she typed a letter for subject on

4/21/61, which letter was directed to a Mr._W. PHILIP COX,

BETTY PARENT explained

1613 K strect, Washington, to abtain lagge amphibious ducks

that this man is supposed

for export to Germany for a man named JOHN KAFFKA, whom

she described as a white man, middle aged, tall, and wears

a big mustache.

She was not

aware of the ultimate purpose

for the acquisition of these amphibious ducks. Inquiry was

made of BETTY PARENT as to whether or not the address she

gave did not reflect whether the K Street was in the Northwest,

Southwest or Northeast, Southeast section of Washington, as it

appears that this is an incomplete address.

BETTY PARENT also advised that on the past week end

subject DALZELL attempted to persuade SERGIO ARCACHA SMITH,
