Commander ROGER MADSON, United States Coast

Guard, Captain of the Port,

Tampa, Florida advised

that it was his opinion that the explosion aboard the

Japanese freighter, "Asaka Maru", moored at Port Sutton,

Tampa, Florida which explosion occurred at approximately

9:23 p.m. on the night of May 30, 1968 should be

investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

His opinion is based on the fact that it appears that the

explosion occurred as a result of someone placing a bomb

in the rudder post area of this vessel. The act is a

criminal act, further that his agency

is not equipped

to conduct a

criminal investigation as such.

Commander MADSON was informed that the facts

of this matter would be immediately discussed with the

United States Attorney, Tampa for his opinion as to the

section of

the Federal Statute under which this particular

violation would fall.

Shortly thereafter on this same date, May 31,

"1968, Commander MADSON was informed that Assistant United

States Attorney ROBERT H. MACKENZIEaat Tampa, Florida

had advised that the facts as known

to date in regard

to the explosion of the "Asaka Maru" would be covered

under section 2275, Title 18, United States Code with

regard to Crime on

the High Seas - Firing Or Tampering

With Vessel.

Commander MADSON was further advised that

the FBI would immediately undertake the investigation

in this matter.

Lieutenant ROBERT GANICEK, United States Coast

Guard,

Tampa, Florida advised that when he initially

interviewed Captain S. TANINQ of the Japanese freighter

"Asaka Maru", it was the belief of the Captain that the

explosion aboard his vessel was caused by a mine or

some external force which blew into the ship while moored

at the pier of Port Sutton, Tampa, Florida on the night

of May 30, 1968.

Commander GANICER informed that he had

difficulty in the course of his interview with the

Captain in view of the language barrior and since the

Captain spoke very little English.

Commander GANECEK said it was his opinion

initally that the bomb caused

the explosion placed there

from within the vessel as opposed from being placed into

the rudder post area from the outside.

He said he

based this opinion initially on the fact that it had been

determined that the i7 or i8 nuts securing the hatch cover

in the rudder post area appeared to have been removed recently

as they were loosened in the presence of two of his

officers, with very little effort.

He said normally

removal of this hatch would require quite a bit of exertion

and one would normally have to have a hamner and wrench

to loosen the nuts.

He stated, however, that the possibility exists

that the bomb could have been placed through the aperture

around the rudder post as the aperture area on Japanese

vessels around the rudder post is from anywhere from

three to four

Commander GENECEK said it was his

opinion that aon American vessels when the rudder post

merely, approximately one hald inch to one inch, and

accordingly it would appear to be impossible for someone

to place a bomb outside the vessel.
