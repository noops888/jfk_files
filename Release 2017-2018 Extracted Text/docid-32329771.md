EJo GALINS, Chief Engineer, FCC, 230 South

Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, was contacted regarding

his identification as to the assignee of a radio frequency

Police Department on October 28, 1975, on charges

of possession of burglary tools.

GALINS advised that any law enforcement agency

other than Federal agencies, licensed with the FCC are

assigned radio frequencies, the identification of which

is readily available by law through the FCC upon personal

request of an official at any FCC office. He further

advised that frequencies are designated to law

enforcement agencies in various parts of the continental

United States so there is necessarily much duplication

by way of frequency assignments.

He advised that frequency 154.800 is assigned

by FCC to the Broward County Sheriff's Office (Fort Lauderdale,

Florida), Dade County Sheriff's Office (Miami, Florida),

the Orange County Sheriff's Office (Orlando,

Florida),

Deming, New Mexico, Police Department; and the New Mexico

State Police. He advised that the only assignment of this

frequency in the State of Illinois is to the Decatur,

Illinois, Police Department.

He indicated that this

frequency

was probably assigned to other law enforcement agencies in other

states, and this wasnot meant to be an exhaustive listing

of the

assignments of this frequency.

He further advised that although frequencies

assigned to Federal investigative agencies are classified

information, any electronics expert can very easily determine

frequencies assigned tovarious agencies by monitoring.

communications on the various frequencies.

Departmental Attorney GREG WARD, Chicago Strike

Force, Chicago, Illinois, advised on November 20, 1975,

that/

INFORMANTS

CG 6348-C advised on November 21, 1975,

that the Peeping Tom Bookstore, 1337 North

Wells

Street

has had a portion of the ownership transferred from

KURT HANSEN and FRANCIS CARNICLE to the owner, RED,

who is under the control of MARSHALL CAIFANO.

Source

advised that JOEY LOMBARDO is really the man in charge at

that Peeping Tom Bookstore and MARSHALL CAIFANO only has an

interest there as a token gesture from LOMBARDO •

Source continued by stating that he knows JOEY

LOMBARDO and his associates all have police scanner

radios which they obtain on the open market from places

such as Radio Shack®

Source advised that GENE ZIPERSTEIN /has sold

his house which was located next to IRV WEINER'S.

WEINER has purchased ZIPERSTEIN's old house. WEINER

and LOMBARDO definitely control GENE ZIPERSTEIN. Their

control of ZIPERSTEIN does not result from muscle, but

the fact that WEINER was the money behind GENE's

father's

acquisition of numerous medical centers.

Source advised JOEY LOMBARDO and GENE ZIPERSTEIN

own a garage building in the vicinity of Milwaukee and

North Avenue. The garage is on the south side of North

Avenue within a half block of Milwaukee.

Source thinks

it is east of Milwaukee Avenue, but it is located next

door to a hotel that has a steam bath. The garage is a

large building that could accommodate semi trucks. Within

the garage are stored hot dogs stands that were constructed

by JOE COS and KURT HANSEN.

ZIPERSTEIN uses the building

to store medical supplies that ZIPERSTEINgets from drug

stores going out of business.
