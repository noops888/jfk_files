andYNY 4888+5.

The interview of the subject was conducted on 9/19/67

by SAS MERWIN E. MELLOR and WILLIAM J. DAVIS. The subject

greeted sAS warmly and was effusive in expressing both his

praise of the FBI and his devotion to the denocratic systen

as epitomized by the United States.

He seemed most anxious

to cooperate with the Bureau.

It 1s felt however, that

the subject's effusiveness may have been a compensatory

effort on his part to cover his lack of candor in duscussing

the full scope of his activities.

If full credit is given

to the sources of information regarding the subject's involve-

ment in violence, It becomes obvious that be is withholding

ORIGINAL FTLUD IN

Information concerning this aspect of his affairs.
