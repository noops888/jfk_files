Memo, Baumgardner to Sullivan, 7/7/64, stated New Vori Office advisea

that new book by Frank A. Capell entitled "'The Strange Death of Marilyn Monroe,

which alleges that Aitorney General Robert F. Kennedy had an intimate relationship

with Miss Monroe, would be ready for sale ?bout 7/10/64.

Kennedy's Friendship with Miss Monroe "Well Known"

The New York Cifice has now furnished us with a copy of this 70-page

book. The book claims that Miss Monroe's involvement with Kennedy "'was well

known to her friends and reporters in the Hollywood area," but was never

publicized. It is alleged that "there are person-to-person telephone calls, living

withesses, tage recordings and certain writings to attest the eloseness-of their

¡friendship."

The author suggests that Miss Monroe "was led to believe his intentions

were serious," and that Kennedy had promised to divorce his wife and marry her.

When he failed to do so, the book charges, sha "threatened to expose their

relationship." which would have ruined his presidential aspirations. It was then

that Kenneäy decided "to take drastic action."

Kennedy Had Communists "Murder"' Miss Monroe

According to the book, Kennedy used "the Communist Conspiracy which

is expert in the scientific elimination of its enemies" to dispose of Miss Monroe

by making her murder appear to be a suicide. This could have been achieved

without great difficulty, the author points out, because her personal physician.

Di. Hyman Engelberg, was a communist.

Memo Smith to Sulliva:

Re:

FRANK A. CAPULI

INFORMATION CONCERNING

Most of the allegations mace against Kennedy are contained in the

chapter entitled "The V.I.P." (pages 49-61) and on pages 69 and 70.

Allegation Previously Branded False

It should be noted that the allegation concerning the Attorney General ani

Miss Monroe has been circulated in the past and has been branded as utterly false.

References to Director and FEI

There are several references in the book to the Director and/or the RBI

A biographical sketch of Capell on page 3 states that, while associated with the

Westchester County, New York, Sheriff's Ofice, "he supervised the investigation

of over five thousan individuals and organizations, including Nazis, Fascists

and Communists, on behalf of the F. B.I. in most cases."

On page 49, it is stated that "under the direction of Bobby Kennedy the

I. B.I. has been frustrated as never before."

On page 69, it is said that Mr. Hoover does not share Kenneay's opinion

that the Communist Party, USA, "is a winámill virtually powerless to harm the

United States. "

On page 70, reference is made to an anonymous letter quoted in a column

loi Walter Winchell datelined May 25, 1964, at Hollywood, California, which told

of a 23-year-old Beverly Hills blonde who had been "terrorized for months. by the

same person who caused Marilyn Monroe's death.... You can check this with

|F. B.I, Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Grapp in L.A..... Her initials are M.J."

Our Los Angeles Office reported that "M.J." was Mary Lou Jones, a

would-he actress of no talent, who is apparently mentally disturbed. Miss Jones

complained to the Beverly Fills, California, Police Department that she was

being foliowed and harassed by unidentified men, but her allegations were completely

unsubstantiated by the police.

Dr. Hyman Engelberg Former Security Inder Subject M

Di. Hyman Engelberg was the subiect of a Security Matter-C investigato,

but his security index card was canceled in 1353 after his cooperativoterview

with Agents of our LOS Angeles Cifice. At that time Di. Engelberg admitted

membership in the Communist Party from about 1939 to 1948. 1 3 1
