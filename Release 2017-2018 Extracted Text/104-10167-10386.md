i: fortation he had received to the effect that Alberto

ALBERTI, who was accing as miel of the liveracion air

was trying to overtorow the Revolutionary Council

and that Van Horn nad something to do with this too.

Hom told GARCIA to infora AlDIP-1 that de was mistaken

about his baving any part in the alleged ALBERTI plot to

overtorow the Council; that de was in contact with

ALBERTI in the capacity. of Assistant Air Attache complying

with nis duties of liaison with toe Cuban pilots in Miami,

and that as far as he knew, ALBERTI was not attempting to

overtnrow the Council. GARCIA relayed this incoration

to AMDIP-1, and again told Van dom that A'DIP-l wisned

nave an interview with him before going to haspington

and informing U.S. officials about the "plot':

very upset because the "House" was demanding Major Van Horn's

appearance before Mr. Goodwin to discuss a serious problem.

with ADIP-l's accusation of a plot to overthrow toe concil.
