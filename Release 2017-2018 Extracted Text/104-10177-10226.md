COS. met.with a representative of LNERGQ on 22 November 1972

in an attempt to clarify the confusing issue over ANIDESK-l as outlined in

reference A.

The substance of LNERGO's remarks are as follows:

LNERGO ascertained from conversations with AMDESK-1 that the latter

, had been

some, time during the summer of early fall of 1972

business.

During his visit

AMDESK contacted

his old friend CIRASH-6. In the course of this contäct, CIRASH-h

evidenced an interest in re-establishing contact with BKHERALD

Subsequently, AMDESK-l, through the good offices of his

arranged this contact which eventually took place.

LNFRGO. has since been advised by AMDESK-] that he (AMDESK-1) did not

accompany CIRASH-6

2. The problem, therefore, appears to be that AMDESK-l, for

reasons not clear to us. reported to LNAGON that he and an unidentified

high ranking

together, and he (AMDESK-1) met with a BKHERALD officer. LNERGO

mentioned that they have always found AMDESK-] honest and objective,

but there is always the possibility that he could have misrepresented the

information he passed to LNAGON, perhaps to gir some advantage for

himself with that service. In any event, LNERGO prefers not to pursue the

matter further with AMDESK-l as they are reluctant to become involved in

what could be a misunderstanding between the Station and LNAGON.

The Station also prefers not to raise the issue again with LNAGON

as the letter claime AMIDESK. I relater the details of bis contacts

with BKHERALD in confidence,

and to pressure him now for more

facts would only tend to alienate him with LNAGON.
