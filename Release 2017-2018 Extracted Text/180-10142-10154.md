telling Headquarters,

for some reason, of the 9/27 contact.

I do not mean to suggest that the reason is sinister or

innocent, but according to cable traffic, the Mexico City

station, anyway, is not telling you about it.

Mr: Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let us look at CIA number 211.

Mr. Scelso. What was the nature of that 9/27 contact?

Mr. Goldsmith. If you would like, you can review the

transcript again. Essentially, it was a conversation between

I soviét Duran and soviet Embassy, of consulate officials

in respect to Oswald's obtaining a visa and the problem of

obtaining a visa.

Reading through CIA number 211, can you identify that?

MI. Scelso. I suppose this was

Mr. Goldsmith. Correct.

Why do you think that, in paragraph 3, the person send-

ing the cable considered the fact that| pitensos was aware of

Oswald's contact to be important? The fact that he was

aware

20

of it, and passing the information along would be important?

2!

MI. Scelso. You get into a psychological question.

was through our Chiet

Station

rather than

through the Ambassadors.] This caused no great

problem with the then-Ambassador whose name I have forgotten.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thomas Mann?

Mr. Scelso. Yes. He was a very fine guy and recognized

the usefulness of this arrangement. The next Ambassador,

MI. Friedman, tried to cut Winn Scott out of contact with the

in Winn Scott and said, I want you to send a cable to the

House telling them I am not going to deal with this jackass,

I want to deal only with you.

So, the result was, eventually, Winston Scott and

Ambassador Friedman went to the White House and talked to

President Johnson and straightened the whole thing out in

favor of Winston Scott.

So scott is just remarking that it is interesting that

Mr. Scelso. Yes. But you do not always know whether

he was informed. I think we always knew he was informed.

It is just significant that the person calls you in and says,

here is some intelligence about the Kennedy thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let us take a look at CIA 210. Would

you please read that?

MI. Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you identify this document?

Mr. Scelso. This is a cover sheet for the cable from

the Mexico station.

Mr. Goldsmith.

The cover sheet to the cable we just

referred to?

MI. Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Winn Scott here indicates, due memo

of may meeting with Litensor.

MI.

Scelso. It is adäressed to this person who is

supposed to write a memo on it.

Mt. Goldsmith. Scott? That is Scott's signature.

MI. Scelso. Yes, he writes it back to himself and

reminds himself to write a memo on it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever see the memo?

Mr: Scelso. I do not think so.

MI. Goldsmith. Did you ever talk to Scott about his

meeting with Litensor?

MI. Scelso. I do not Iecall having done so.

Mx. GoIdsmith. In any event, by this time, the Mexico

City station still had not informed Headquarters of the 9-27

contact?

Mr. Scelso. No.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's lo0k at CIA 213.

Mr. Scelso. This was all on the same day.

Mr. Goldsmith. The cable traffic was pretty neavy on

that day, I would imagine.

Mr. Scelso. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. This cable is the first time that the

Mexico City station informs Headquarters about Oswald's

9/27 contacts.

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you think that there is any connec-

tion between the fact that this contact was recorded after

the Mexico City station became aware of the fact that Litenso=

knew about Oswald's contacts?

Mr. Scelso. I would imagine that there were probably

many - several Mexicans transeribing reelstranscribing

things and some got finished before others.

MI. Goldsmith. This was months ago. The conversations:

have been transcribed and reviewed months earlier.

Mr. Scelso. What are the numbers of the various cables:

They were all going out in a

series.

They may have had

several analysts in the Mexico Station working on them.

One

said you ta'e this one and write a cable and the other said

you take that one and write a cable, and so on, and they went

out and went into the COMM Center and the COMM Center sent

them out in some order. Here.
