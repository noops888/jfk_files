coach of the Green Bay

Packers football, team, a mem

a member of the National Professional

Football League at Green Bay, Wis., was interviewed by SAS

GEORGE K. AYERS and EDWARD E.

CONVERSE on 10/1/62. LOMBARDI

appeared extremely cooperative and willing to discuss

activities of the various players in the National Football

League and, in particular, activities of PAUL HORNUNG,

presently a halfback on the Green Bay Packers Football Team.

LOMBARDI at the outset of the interview advised

he desired to assure the FBI of his 100% cooperation in

furnishing any information that came to his attention

regarding hoodlums, contacts of football players or any

information of help to the FBI.

In this connection, he pointed

out that he is presently managing and operating a two million,

dollar yearly business in regards to the Packers Football

Team and well realizes the dangers involved should a sports/

scandal in any way even touch players in the league and,

particularly, Green Bay Packers players.

LOMBARDI pointed out that actually the league rules

and practices are such that the minute any suspicious contact

is made with a football player or anyone connected with the

professional football league, this contact is immediately to be

JIM TAYLOR at the Sahara Inn at this time in view of

necessity of protecting original informant, RUSSELL "JAKE"

SKALL, PCI.

HORNUNG denied knowledge of any of the figures

reputed to be behind the Sahara and was specifically

asked concerning possible acquaintanceship by him with

MARSHALL CAIFANO, SAM GIANCANA and MURRAY HUMPHREYS. He

stated the names of these individuals meant nothing to

him, and he did not know them.

These names were asked

him in connection also with the names of THOMAS HIGHWAY

SIMONE, CARL CORKY CIVELLA and CARMEN CIVELLA, DANNY LAWSON,

PETE and BERNIE PALMENTERE and GEORGE HARRIS, all reportedly

seen at one time or another with HORNUNG in Kansas City,

at which time HORNUNG was in the Army but still a member

of the Green Bay Packers.

appearances were on

;.

December 15, 1961 and January 6, 1962.

HORNUNG advised that PHIL LOMBARDO had been

in the Army with him, took him to the Taco House in

Kansas City, and

recalled vaguely meeting some of

these people, but it meant nothing to him. He said that,

in fact, he had been told by a friend whose name he

declined to mention in Kansas City never to appear again

at the Taco House or with any of the above individuals

and, in fact, he did not.

In addition, HORNUNG advised he has travelled

extensively throughout the US in the off season, attends

sporting events all over, attended the JOHANSSEN-PATTERSON

fight in Miami, Fla. and met WILLIE HARTACK in Miami but

just met him socially and had no further connection with

him.

HORNUNG did advise he has an acquaintanceship

with GIL/BECKLEY, whom he volunteered is presently under

indictment by the FBI as a bookie and knew this individual

at Newport, Ky. He stated GIL BECKLEY invited him,

HORNUNG, to sit with him at the PATTERSON-JOHANSSEN fight

but then pointed out to HORNUNG that he probably would

not want to be seen with him, and they both agreed that

it would be unwise for HORNUNG to ever be seen in BECKLEY'S
