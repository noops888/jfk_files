MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

SUBJECT

: William George GAUDET

SF#401 996-B

•.1494.911111"

I. On 15 January 1976 the attached article concerning

Subject

appeared in

the Washington Star. The article points

out that Subject has received a Mexican tourist visa from the

Mexican Consulate in New Orleans, the number of which immedi-

ately preceded the number of a tourist visa given to Lee

Harvey OSWALD.

The

article goes on

to claim that GAUDET was

a CIA agent and claims that the possible relationship between

GAUDET and OSWALD was never brought to the attention of the

Warren Commission. •

The basis for

the story's claim that

GAUDET

was a CIA agent appears to be statements made by GAUDET.

He indicates in the article that he was associated with the

Agency from 1947 to 1969 and gives the impression that he

undertook clandestine missions for the Agency in Latin America.

2. A review of GAUDET's security file reveals that he

is the publisher/editor of a news letter entitled Latin American

Report.

He was approved for contact by OOC in 1948.

In 1950

approval was given to pay Subject for special reports which

his newsletter would compile at the request of the Agency. In

March 1953 he was

again approved for contact by 00C and to

engage in discussions with them up to the level of Secret

information. The security file does not reflect how long 0OC

continued to maintain contact with Subject. Furthermore,

security file does not reflect that Subject was ever asked to

undertake any clandestine assignments for the Agency. It

appears that his only use by the Agency was debriefing of him

in regard to his expertise in Latin American affairs.

GAUDET's security file does not reflect any conneç-

tion between himself

and Lee Harvey OSWALD.

After the story in the Washington Star was seen on

25 January

1976, his file was ordered from retirement in

approximately 1510 hours on 16 January,
