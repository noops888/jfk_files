currently dasigned to CIA headquarters, Washington, DEle is

March 24, 1959, A. P. Flynn, CIA, aduised the Liaison Agent that as

a result of his seruice in Cuba Gomez does know several Cuban

Government officials.

Flynn stated that Gomes has been in touch

with Lieutenant Commander Pons, whom he has known for several years,

and that the contact in Washington, D. C., was strictly of a social

nature.

Flynn aduised that

Gomer is not involued in any intelligence

operation with the Cubans

Although Flynn did not volunteer any more information,

is endeavoring to build up coverage in Cuba after losing sources

when the Batista Gouernment was overthrown.

old contacts with a view of obtaining leads for new sources in Cuba
