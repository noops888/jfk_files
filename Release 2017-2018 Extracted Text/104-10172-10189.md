RoolassiMoation of position of Chiof of Latia Amorioan Divinion

Phia roolanal Montion aotion la based on two conalderation:

1. There has boon a marked inerease in the oomplesty of wert

and the responalbilition of the position of Chief of the Latin Anerfas

Divinion during the past yoor.

This has to sone o stent been reflooted

In the Increase in the alse of the Division from 17 persons 1m Augurt

of last goar to nearly double that nunder at present, and the Inorense

of sootions from tro to threo. In part thim 1a also roflootod in the

largo amount of overtino now boing workod by the Diviaion. A request

for l4 new positions and the croation of a fourth Seotion, already

approved by the Direator of the Branah, do now before the Bureau of

the Budgot.

Beginning In Hovesber 1943, the Chiof of the Latin Anerlean

Division successfully initiated a sorion of agroomonta with the Stato

Department under which the Division has been preparing varied types of

economio, geographio, and political reporte, all of which lavolve ar

codingly careful negotiation,

consultation, and planning at a high

ochelon, inoluding the Chlof of the Offloe of Amerioan Republion Affalre

and hia Divioion Chlofa,®

The Chiof of the Latin Amorioan Diriaton has In addition effeotively

Introduoed o progran of Joint atudios with the Foreiga Soononlo Adain!

•tration. This progran also involves elaborate liaison relations and

planning at a high echelor, Inoluding the Direotor of the Pan Amerlean

Branoh and his Divlalon Chiefs. .

In recent wooks the Divinion for the fret time has been called

upon to undertale not only the partial exeoution, but also the diree-

tion of highest priority topographio work for the Joint Chlora of stafl..

Thia work requiring 0sS to organise and intograte the combined resource

of the Arry, Havy, and Alr Corps, has further Inorensed the noope of

profensional, adminlotrativo, and ladson responnibilities of the Chief

of the Latta American Diviilon.®*

Other new hmotions addod by the Miriaion duria; the past yoor

Inoludo continuing coononto studioa for the Cartel Comaltton and

spoolal atudios requestod by the oporating branches of cho 088. Da

the lactor connestion, the Chlot of the Diviaion has boon requirod

to undertoro spoolal liaison taska direatly for Genoral Donovan u1ta

high offlolala of Alliod covermnanto.

The conoral nature of the incroaso in the work load of the Latin

Amarion Divinien and the baottround of the rapidly develonin, ariale

In Latin Asorion Juati ying thie Inoreaco, are Indoniod in ry mao-

randun to Li. Janes Q. May of 5. August,

ro the roquet for new poste

$10n0:

I ahould like to exphanine that the new devoloprante in the

work of the Divlelon have meant not only an inorense in the lond to bo

oartled, but also, and far more important, a conuiderablo qualitative

Inorense bearing on the aignitloance of the work, on the laportance

and complarty of the Division's relations with outside ageneles, and

on the highor arilla and rosponsibilitlos requirod of the chiot of the

Divialon,

I have bean Informed by the Director of tho Branch that these

rosponalbilities have all been handled with marked success.

lo Tho pooiton of Chlof of the Latin Anoriona Division had a F8

olasalfloation at the timo Colonol Janos loft the position and I maa

appointed la hio place.

I was granted a f? rating when I replaood

• Colonel Jams on the grounde that ny provious rating an Deputy Chio!.

undor colonol Janos was P-f.. It was underatood at the tine: that aftor

comploting one yoar'o sorvice at the P-? level, I would be eligible

SUBJECT: Promotion of kaurice Halperin

DATE July 18, 1942

This menorandum is to recoumend the promotion of Maurice

Ealperin fron: P-5 to P-6.

Halperin entered on duty in this office at the grade of

Pal on October 2, 1941.

His previous background in the Latin

'American field Includes a long-continued interest in the problems

of Nexico, especlally with reference to the program of land re

distribution.

He has made ten trips to kexico, spending a total

of two years

in that country.

He has written

nunerous reports

based on these fiold studies, the more important of which are:

also outstanding in his ability to render his reports in clear,

On February 11, 1942, Dr. Halperin mas made assistant chief

of the Latin American Section.

cho mjor problems of admiristration mith the section has been

the separation of the workers from the section chief. It has

proved Imperative to maintain the headquarters of the section

25th and E Streets where close contact is maintained with the head

osfices of the agency and with the chief sources of information.

able. The actual work of preparing reports and surveys, there-

fore,

rust be carried on in the library oi Congress Annex.

In

order to mairitain close liaison betreen the section chief and

the staff, a conference is held at 25th and E Streets three

Lorniris

each week at which the sen in charge of the five regional

subsections are in attendance.

The remainider of

the staff, how

ever, renains permanently at the inner.

• Under these circumstences the assistant chief mist assume a

large seasure of independent responsibility for the actual opera-

tion of the section and for the personnel problems.

Dr. Halperin

has shorn a marked ability in this.

He has set up

simple but

effective rachinery for the performance of the tasks assigned to

the section and for the checking of individual performance with

respect to these tasks.

He has gained the respect and confidence

of the reubers of the staff because of his fairness and honesty

In desling with then, but he has not failed to hold before them

a high standard of performance.

Because of the large amount of individual responsibility

which has been placed on

the assistant chier of this

section, and

because the experience of nearly & year nor demonstrates Dr.

Halperin's capacity to assune these

responsibilities successfully,

I recozend his promotion to P-t.

Hoover's lettor of l'arch

07 with regard to Dr.

Krarice

Halperin,

a caroful investiration mas made of the case.

As none of the informants of the F.3.I. seemed to

hold the belief that Dr. Alterin was a communist,

the

crux of the

matter scened tobe that he hod been dis-

from the recte i chat i-s tron the at earneared

meeting of February 1l

the Board of kegents of that

university had reversed therselves and reinstated Dr.

Halberin as Associatr Profesor of lodern langunres

without prejudice, continuing his sabbatical leave, we

concluded that the only pininistentive setion by 0.0.I.

necessary in Dr. Halperin's case mas that of exonciation

and so informed Mr. Hoover on Aaril 10.

on lay 5 Hr. Hoover wrote you that, since the

earlier correspondence

anotier informant had advised

the F.3.l.

that Dr.

alrerin's activities on behalf

of the communist movement coula be traced

back

years, and that, during

June lics, he was chosen as a

member of the connunist organization delegated to Cuba,

which he (the informant, statea was for the purnose of

carrying on subversive activites.

hen you referred

this natter to me,. I called r. Lawrence buggen or the

Depertment of State, who has handled for that Department

in 1935

the problems arising from the arrest and deporta

tion of the persons traveling with Odets. Ar. Ducren

oftered to examine the file on this case and give me

his oninion.

• In view of the nressure on his time, this

involved

some delav

but he now inforns me that,

although

some of the people who went me!

adets on the trip to

Cuba in 1935 may have been cornists, others ire simply

people who mere troubled at the state of atfeirs in Cuba

and wished to no dom to make an investication of the

unfortunate conditions in the isiand at that tine.

SUBJECT: Pronotion of Maurice Halperin

DATE February 6, 1942

Dr. Maurice Balperin has been covering Mexico and

Central America and, in addition, the general field of

subversive activities throughout

Latin America®

He has

recently been given additional special assignments by

Colonel Donovan and by the Departuent of State.

His

special report on Spanish Falange activities was pre-

pared in addition to his regular duties relating to his

regional assignment. In atterpting to establish a sat

Isfactory organization that will permit the section to

function efficiently both in routine work and on special

assignments, and also when separated between the Library

of Congress

and the headquarters of the C.0.I., I have

hoped to make use of Dr. Halperin as assistant chief in

charge of the Library staff.

Because of Dr. Halperin's

ability, the need for an extension of his services, and

the fact that he has received an offer at a higher

rating outside of this agency, I recommend his immediate

promotion to P-5.
