HED: nib

Internal Revenue Service Agents are of the opinion

that any prosecution of ROSSELLI for income tax evasion will

probably have to be made on the years 1957 and 1958, as at

the present time, after examining his returns for 1959, 1960,

and 1961, they can see no evidence of

a violation.

Close liaison is being maintained by the Los Angeles

Office with Internal Revenue Service.

On November 7 and 8, 1962, FBI reports in the

ROSSELLI case prior to the report of SA HAROLD F. DODGE,

dated September 12, 1960, at Los Angeles, were reviewed

with SAS VERNON E. LYNCH and HELMER AKOLA, and they indicated,

as is set out in Los Angeles airtel to the Bureau dated

November 8, 1962, certain pages of these reports containing

information regarding ROSSELLI's bank account and investment

which they would like

Photostats of

In Los Angeles airtel,

it was stated that UACB by October 19, 1962, these Photostats

would-be made available to Internal Revenue Service.

During the first part of December, SAS LYNCH and

AKOLA plan on making a trip to New Orleans to Interview Mrs.

PHIL KASTEL for information she may be able to furnish

regarding the formation of the Tropicana Hotel, in which her

deceased husband was active.

They then intend

to proceed to

Miami, Florida, where they expect to interview JACK BROOKS

and obtain papers and documents he might have concerning his

business association with ROSSELLI, and also to interview an

individual named LEO MALONY, who held the stock of PHIL KASTEL

in his, MALONY! s, name.
