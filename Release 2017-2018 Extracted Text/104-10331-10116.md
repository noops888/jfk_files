Sorry for the premature sending of this answer but my fingerues got in front of my brain. (not hard

to do these days)

My view is the the Agency owes a courtesy call to its employees even if after the the Board

contact. I agree that the DO should limit it involvment so as not to creat a situation and only play a

role as required as in the Whitten one. We need to at least explain the Agency's role and process

with the Board. This also allows the person to present a question or concern if they have one.
