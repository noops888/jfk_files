On July 11, 1978, SA Reighley was interviewed by

Mr. Sacco advised he is in the

of "tying up loose ends" in that portion of the Martin

of his questioning concerned activities of the Klan. and Minutemen

groups in the Reading, Pennsylvania, area during the period of

August, 1967, through April, 1968, when Dr. King was assassinated.

SA Reighley was able to give Mr. Sacco a fairly detailed account

of the general activities of these groups during the pertinent

period.

During the above interview, Mr. Sacco advised that

from certain sources

regarding the relationship between

• the FBI and

Klan and

Minutemen groups in the Philadelphia fol territory, and, more

specifically, the Reading area. The "allegations" being that the

FBI "on a regular basis" furnished right wing extremist groups

with intelligence information for their use against Dr. King.

He stated he has specific reference to an allegation that the FBI

in the Reading area

photographs

of Dr. King in attendance at a meeting with

furnished extremist groups munists" which!!

House Select Committee on Assassinations

I wi

In answer to the above "allegation", SA Reighley

emphatically denied that the FBI in the Reading area had ever

engaged in such activity during his assignment there, nor

had he ever received any information that this had been done

in the FBI elsewhere.

Mr. Sacco stated that the above "allegations" came

from Roy Frankhouser (former Grand Dragon of the United Klans

of America for Pennsylvania and activitist with numerous white

hate groups including the Minutemen); and that he had also received

the same information from "other sources".

He later admitted

that his investigation indicates that the

information received

from

"other sources" emanated from Frankhouser.

Mr. Sacco then

asked numerous questions about Frankhouser and his background

and SA Reighley answered these questions in detail. He also

asked questions regarding the relationship between Frankhouser

and FBI Agents in the Philadelphia Division.

He made specific

reference to retired SAs William E. Davis and Frank Kauffman,

formerly of the Reading Resident Agency; and retired Assistant

Director Joe Jameson, former Special Agent in Charge of the

Philadelphia Division.

with Frankhouser had always been an "investigator-subject"

same relationship that Davis and Kauffman had with

SA Reighley also advised Mr. Sacco that he has no information

all as to whether or not Frankhouser had any relationship

whatsoever with Special Agent in Charge Jameson but that it is

highly unlikely that Frankhouser had ever even met Mr. Jameson.

Mr.. Sacco stated that SA Reighley had sufficiently

covered the area in which he is interested and he sees no

stan a that

necessity to call anyone else from the FBI concerning this

particular matter.

eter no: indicated®

He- indicated that he had certainly questioned

the reliability of the source of the allegations, namely,

Frankhouser; however, his main concern was leaving the

"allegations"

unanswered.

SA Reighley thanked Mr. Sacco for the opportunity

to answer the "allegations" and offered to be of any future

assistance in this regard.

DESTRUCTION OF FIELD

/AND/ RECORDS

The Attorney General, by letter dated 6/6/77, informed

FBIHQ that the moratorium on 'file destruction has been lifted

and indicated his approval for the FBI to resume the file

destruction program.

However, he specifically instructed that

all records in litigation and

those records which the Select

Committee on Assassinations has asked to be retained must be

preserved.

By Bureau teletypes 11/24/76 and 1/5/77, captioned

"House Select Committee on Assassinations," you were

furnished

instructions concerning the preservation of records in which

the Committee has specific interest.

These subjects have again

i been identified and are set forth in attached one-page enclosure:

• Additionally, enclosed are 407 individual documents which

identify

cases involved in Civil Litigation (CL) and/or

Information and Privacy Acts Litigation (IPAL) that must be

preserved in accordance with the Attorney General's directive.

It is to be noted pages 129 and 221 carry. continuation page A,

and page 332 carries continuation pages

• A through K for a total

of 420 pages. In this regard, it is essential that any

data relating to the plaintiffs, defendants, subject matter

and/or requester be retained, providing it can be established

that information is identical

with the particular person or

organization

that is

involved

with the spécific litigation.

This list will assist you in identifying corresponding and

related cases in:your office that must be preserved.

In order to be sure that no case file(s) is destroyed

involving these matters, you should conduct a thorough

search of your general indices on each name, organization,

publication, etc. relative to each civil action. It is

to be noted that in certain cases the topic matter must

be searched, such as "Illegal Opening

of Mail", etc. An

exception to the mandatory search will be those instances

where the "Attorney General, EdwardH. Levi, Griffin B. Bell,

case files containing information that can be positively

identified as being identical to the person or organization

involved must be appropriately marked

for preservation and

excluded from destruction until the litigation has been

resolved.

This applies to auxiliary offices, office of

origin, and Legats.

FBIHQ case files relating to this

material are likewise excluded from destruction.

Once all searches have been completed and, where

necessary, files appropriately marked for retention, you should

establish

a control file in the newly created 197 classification

(Civil Actions or Claims Against the Guvernment) wherein the

enclosed documents with any related search slips attached

thereto are to be filed alphabetically by case title and

maintained until disposition is received. from FBIHQ.•

To facilitate this effort and establish uniform

-procedures throughout the field, you should immediately

arrange to procure rubber

stamps with. one quarter (k) inch

high letters that read as follows:

i To i missed.

1) DO NOT DESTROY - PENDING LITIGATION

2) DO NOT DESTROY - PRESERVE FOR SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS

Where applicable; the appropriate stamp, using

red ink, is to be affixed to the outside of the file cover..

Should a file(s) be contained in a consolidated volume, the

stamp should be placed on the top serial of the particular

file(s) within the consolidated volume.

In the event a case

file(s) is involved in more than one litigation

the appropriate

stamps and date of applicable Bureau communication are to be

likewise affixed to the file(s) for each separate litigation.

In addition to above, destruction rules concerning

auxiliary office files have been modified to require that

cases containing identification

15c. Legal Attaches should pursue file destruction program
