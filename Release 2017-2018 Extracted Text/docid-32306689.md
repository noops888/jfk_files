II. Laurentian Mountains, 50 Miles from Montreal

Information has previously been reported (page 136,

report SA ARTHUR V. HART,

5/21/59, Albany) that information was

alleged that a meeting of Italiar

hoodlums similar to instant

meeting was to be held in the Laurentian Mountains about 50

miles from Montreal some time after December 23, 1958. It

confidentially advised the Assistant Commissioner of the

Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Ottawa,

Canada, by letter

of the possibility that the meeting might take place and

suggested consideration be given that the meeting could be

lodge owned by GIUSIPPE/CATRONI, 345 Emory Street

CATRONI is described as a notorious

canada, telephone CA 9-371900L

In this connection it is noted that the local press

carried a brief item concerning the recent arrest of an

individual who could be identical to this CATRONI, together

with others, at Montreal, Canada, in possession of some

kilos of heroin. worth approximately $3,000,000.00. A lead is

set out to obtain fürther data concerning this and

any

connection there may be between Apalachin hoodlums and this

Montreal operation since it has been alleged that a purpose

of instant meeting was to discuss narcotics.

E.: INTERVIEWS OF POSSIBLE SOURCES

On March 11, 1959, at Galveston, Texas, Confidential

Informant Albany T-66

told SA JOHN E. FRANKLIN that he had been

in touch with BENNIE BICKERS at Dallas, Texas, on the telephone

and BICKERS informed that he had been unable to determine the

reason for JOSEPH FRANCIS. CIVELLO of Dallas having attended

instant meeting.

Informant said it appeared

that BICKERS

would be unable

to determine why CIVELLO was

in attendance.

On June 9, 1959, I-66 was recontacted by SA FRANKLIN

and he said that approximately one month before he had been in

touch with BICKERS (a friend of CIVELLO). Informant said

BICKERS told him he had been unable to determine why CIVELLO

went to Apalachin.
