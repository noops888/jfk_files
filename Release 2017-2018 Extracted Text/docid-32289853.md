On February 6, 1958, the same source advised

that he was specifically referred to Pat Marcy, John

D'Arco's Secretary, in order to receive permission to put

a 26 game into an

establishment in which the source had an

interest, 26 game being a small gambling-type card game

which is

illegal according to the City ordinances of Chicago.

The culmination of Marcy's efforts was the arrangement whereby

Maxwell Police District Plainclothesman known as

"Smokey"

was paid $50 per month in order to overlook the 26 game..

The same source advised that Alderman D'Arco on other

occasions had referred him to Pat Marcy in order to eliminate

competition from Maxwell Street sidewalk consessions, which

were in effect individuals without licenses who sold their

wares in the street.

Marcy settled the dispute, for which

he demanded several

hundred dollars per year so long as the

settlement was binding. The unique method of payment to

Marcy came about when the source was assessed several hundred

dollars for tickets

, to the Democratic organization's picnic,

usually held in the summertime.

Tickets were 50 cents per

and Marcy simply collected enough tickets to cover the

several hundred dollars, which was in fact payment to Marcy

for settling the above-mentioned dispute.

On August 24, 1962, source advised that an individual

closely associated with Pat Marcy had informed him that

Marcy had given orders for all of the "strip joints" in

the

down with the exception of

three. Marcy mentioned that Eddie Foys was one of the three

was to remain open. Marcy in his conversation indicated

but did not specifically say that Gus Alex had given the

order for the strip joints to temporarily go down. Marcy

explained that "they" have about 10 to 12 million dollars

invested in the Sahara Motel

and that "they" are trying to

get as much convention trade to the Sahara as possible.

"They"

figure that if they temporarily cut down some of the strip

joints which attract conventioneers to the Loop area of

Chicago

and to Loop hotels,

many of the conventioneers flying

to Chicago and landing at O'Hare Field will go to the Sahara

Motel nearby to conduct their convention business. Marcy

indicated that plans are to keep the Loop areaaof Chicago

as far as "outfit" controlled strip joints as quiet as

possible temporarily in order to build up business at the

Sahara Motel.
