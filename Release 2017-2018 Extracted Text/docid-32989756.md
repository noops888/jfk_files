Re Springfield report of SA JOSEPH P. BENSON,

WILLIAM

Enclosed for Springfield are two photographs of

EDWARD MOUREY, FBI #327 203C.

For the

information of Springfield, MOUREY has recently

come to the attention of the St. Louis Division through his

FBI #198 3717,

as a lookout and trigger man during their Post Office burglaries.

MOUREY was released from the U. S. Penitentiary, Leavenworth,

Kansas, on 4/28/69 and from that time he is believed to have

resided in the St. Louis area under various aliases. St. Louis

is in the process of gathering extensive background

on

MOUREY and it is felt he would be a good suspect in captioned

matter due to size and physical characteristics.

As his

activities.

are followed Springfield will be advised accordingly.

Re SI airtel to St, 11/5/69.

Miss

P. OLIVASTRO, Ticket Agent, Eastern

Airlines, st. Louis

advised

that

Va., would only be possible through TWA and Eastern

Airlines.

These flights would not be direct but would

have to go to either Louisville or Wash., D.C., to make

appropriate connections.

A switch would be necessary from

either of the above mentioned airlines to Piedmont Airlines.

A review of the flight schedules of both airlines

revealed that it would be impossible to take a flight

from

SL subsequent to 8:00 P.M., and be in Roanoke, Va.,

at 2:22 A.M., on the following

day. She indicated

that

anything departing

SL subsequent to 5:00 P.M., for

Louisville or Washington would necessitate a lay over until

the following morning, that is after 8:00 A.M. to get a

flight into Roanoke.

She expressed the possibility

that a flight to Wash., D.C., then a bus to Roanoke would

possibly put an individual in Roanoke at 2:22.

If not already done,

SI may want to consider

that Richmond at Roanoke identify flights arriving in

Roanoke during the late evening hours from Wash., D.C.,

or Louisville for any information reflecting WAYNE ELMER

SINN, aka Jerry Stahl, was a passenger.
