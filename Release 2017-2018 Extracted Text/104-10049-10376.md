that the recent. Cuban-Dominican troubles were settled personally

for the PBPRIME Chief of State by Mr. William B. PAWLEY, former

Ambassador to Peru and Brazil, who is now engaged in petroleum

activities in the Dominican Republic.

According to the story received by COS, PAWLEY contacted

both President BATISTA of Cuba and Generalissimo TRUJILLO of the

Dominican Republic. The matter was handled privately without

fanfare with the result that the Cubans sent their Minister of

Agriculture to represent them at the great Cattle Fair.

Dominicans made a great show of courtesy toward the Cuban Minister
