In proparing the letter of 18 April 1974 (copy attached)

from the General Counsel to Daniel E: Schultz in response to Mr.

Schultz's letter of 9 April, I obiained from Ms. Chris Hopkins,

WH/COG (x-1325), copies of (1) a secrecy agreement (in Spanish)

by Eugenio Rolando Martinez dated 3 April 1965, (2) an unexecuted

contract (an executed copy cannot be located) between the U.S.

, Guvernment and Mr.

/(Dernard L. Darker)

and (3) a tormination secracy oath signed by bernard L. Barker

dated 12 August 1966. Copies of those documente are attached.

After discussing the matter with Mr. David Phillips,

C/WH Division, 1 prepared the 18 April letter adding the socond

sentence of the first paragraph at the request of Ma.

their association with the Agency. I explained thie Agency's serious

reservations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and

operations that are still in being. I explained that the Agency con-

tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom

Messis. Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency

association. Mr. Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem. Thus,

in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the

Agency is currently not in a position to give Messrs. Barker and

Martine? blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they

had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily

acknowledged those conditions.

4. I mentioned to Mr. Schultz that il, as a result of the

discussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes

that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a

narrow request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee

that we would approve such a request, only that we would consider

it in view of (1) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offor as to his

nenro, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to current

oporations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-

donce of current and polontial Agoney relationships.

ferably some type of PH activity or investigative work which he

Subject said

that he is well aware of this possibility and is making very

discreet inquiries with the assistance of certain friends (Cuban

ex-policemen) who are bolita runners"and who know that he has no

Interest In their bolita activities per se except to learn the

identities of the two Cuban mulatto women. Subject said that his

friends, in addition to possibly helping him, would like to know

the identities of the two women sincee they would then play the

continue running him as a singleton

ll was also felt that he respords more favorably under

the direstion and guidance of one case officer rather than as

his debriefing reports are

3.. During the reporting period October-December, AMCLATTER/1

conducted a total of 16 refugee debrielings and prepared reports

Some of the debriefings required as many as four

In addition,

AMCLATTER/1 submitted ten

WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO GO TO NICARAGUA FOR TRAINING IN PREPARATION

FOR AN EVENTUAL COUP AGAINST THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT. ALEJOS

PROMISED GARCERAN THAT IF THE COUP WERE SUCCESSFUL, ALEJOS WOULD

ESTABLISH A CUBAN GOVERNMENT IN EXILE IN GUATEMALA WITH GARCERAN

AS ITS "PRESIDENT."

3. GARCERAN SAID THAT THE PLAN IS MERELY IN THE "TALKING STAGE"

AND STRESSED THAT THERE ARE AS YET NO SPECIFIC PLANS, LOCATIONS,

OR TIMETABLES IN EFFECT.

4. ALEJOS SAID THAT HE HAD MADE SEVERAL. TRIPS TO GUATEMALA,

AND SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED A MEETING HE HAD HAD WITH ROJAS MARROQUI

(FNU) ON 14 SEPTEMBER DURING THE COURSE OF A FOUR-DAY TRIP "THROUGH

THE FRONTIER." ON THE SAME TRIP ALEJOS ALSO MET WITH ABUNDIO

MALDONADO, JOSE LUIS ARENAS, VILLAGRAN KRAMER, TWO BARRIOS PENA

BROTHERS, AND MARIO MENDEZ MONTENEGRO. (FIELD COMMENTS MENDEZ

MONTENEGRO WAS: CHIEF OF POLICE DURING THE REGIME OF JACOBO ARBENZ

IN ABOUT 1I DIFFERENT HOUSES

5• ALEJUS TOLD GARCERAN THAT, IN ORDER FOR HIS COUP TO

HAVE ANY CHANCE FOR SL'CCESS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HE HAVE THE

FULL SUPPORT OF THE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE. HE ASSURED GARCERAN THAT

HE HAS SUCH SUPPORT.

6. ALEJOS SAID THAT HE WOULD SUPPLY THE NECESSARY ARMS AND

EQUIPMENT TO THE CUBAN EMIGRES. RECRUITED BY GARCERAN. HE REVEALED

THAT THE LOCATION OF THE TRAINING SITE WOULD BE IN NORTHERN

NICARAGUA, A NECESSARY CHOICE BECAUSE SOUTHERN NICARAGUA IS TO

BE USED BY THE SOMOZA/SCHECK FORCES AS A LAUNCHING SITE FOR A COUP

AGAINST THE GOVERNVENT OF COSTA RICA. (FIELD COMMENT: THIS PROBABLY

INVOLVES THE PLANS OF MIGUEL RUIZ HERRERA, A COSTA RICAN REVOLUTIONARY
