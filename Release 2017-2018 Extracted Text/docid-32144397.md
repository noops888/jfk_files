The photographs enclosed with your memorandum of 15 May

1972 depict an unidentified individual who visited the Soviet

Embassy in October 1963. The fource through whom we obtained

these photos is

still active and sensitives

We assume that

any attorney or investigator examining these cropped photos

would want to learn, understandably, where and when they were

taken. Such inquiries could lead to the compromise of our

source. For this reason, therefore, the photographs cannot

be released as requested in your memorandum of 15 May 1972.
