(JFK)

On 11/20/61 SA W. HARLAN BROWN received in person a

handwritten report dated 11/16/61 from DL-6-S.

This report

has been serialized as 134-1A-641.

Informant determined on 11/16/61 that RAYMOND

CARVAJAL, chairman of the local American C. I. Forum, contacted

JOE LANDIN and invited him to attend the forum meetings.

next meeting of the forum,

CARVAJAL said, would be on Tuesday,

11/21/61.

LANDIN told him that on that particular Tuesday he

had to attend a PTA meeting.

After that he assured him he would

attend.

Informant further determined on 11/17/61 that on that

date JOE LANDIN contacted JOE MOLINA who had been a G.

I. Forum

member for a number of years. He warned Mr. MOLINA of ALBERT

GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ, LANDIN pointed out, was dishonest and

untrustworthy: He had tried under false pretenses to secure

money from liberal and labor people.

He had identified himself

as authorized to collect funds for an organization. The organi-

zation of which he had been a vice chairman was at that time

defunct and ALBERT had no such authorization. GONZALEZ, LANDIN

added, had sbifted from a Democrat

to Republican and had supported

TOWER.

He had offered to work with either party, Republican or

Democrat, if he was paid $100 a week.

When ALBERT worked with

Dr, ANDREW and JESSE PRICE to split the Young Democrats Club,

he had been paid $200.,

In short, JOE added, GONZALEZ. was a

dangerous man and it wouldbe to the forum's advantage, as well as

any other organization, not to allow him to handle any funds. Now

that he had moved to Oak Cliff, he was no longer Precinct Chairman

and sought to identify himself with some organization.

Informant determined that MOLINA said he would keep

an eye on him and had wondered why ALBERT GONZALEZ, Attorney

FELIMON VALDEZ, JO. GARCIA and JIMMY TRUJILLO had shown up at

the forum's last meeting.

He recalled that ALBERT GONZALEZ

had mailed him a handbill supporting TOWER.

The above mentioned

individuals, MOLINA said, had not attended a forum meeting in

ages, then all of a sudden they showed up.

Informant had no additional information.
