On July 22, 1965, MI. STANLEY SCHACHTER, U.S.

Customs, Miami, advised that Customs is still conducting

investigation of the alleged actions proposed by LPN.

He said that there have been some indications that this

organization is accelerating its activities but that this

is not unusual because the organization has been "blowing

hot and cold" ever since it was organized, without ever

accomplishing anything.

Miami will continue to maintain contact with

U.S. Customs and other agencies and will promptly report

any information feceived from any source whatsoever.

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

NEUTRALITY MATTERS

Previous investigation has reflected that the

Los Pinos Nueyos (LPN) 1s an anti-FIDEL, CASTRO organiza-

tion of Cuban exiles headquartered in Miami, under the

leadership of ZACARIAS ACOSTA GARCIA, and that this or-

ganization has been making plans for a raid against Cuba

in their 26' vessel THE LIBERTY, which is kept in the

Miami area.

CURRENT ACTIVITIES

On June 15,

1965, GERALD PATRICK/HEMMING, 1036

S.w. 5th Street, Miami,

an American soldier of fortune

and adventurer, who has been associated with ZACARIAS

ACOSTA for the

past year, advised that the LPN has been

unable to execute any military mission against Cuba.

One Of HEMMING's associates, "Little JOE"/ CARMAN, has

been working as technical adviser for ACOSTA up until

about 2 months ago.

During that time GARMAN found that

ACOSTA and his associates had been paying considerable

sums of money for arms. GARMAN examined these weapons

and found they were inoperative. Some of these weapons

had welded barrels, some had missing

parts and many of

them could never be made operative.

After several months of association with ACOSTA

and his men, GARMAN concluded, according to HEMMING,

that the LPN lacked experience and technical "know how"

for any successful mission against Cuba. He also re-

garded their equipment as being inadequate, consequently

GARMAN advised ACOSTA and his men to save their money

and either forget about mounting a mission against Cuba

- or to join some group which had more experience. GARMAN

left the LPN in disgust and is no longer associated with

it.

HEMMING expressed the opinion that the LPN has

no potential for any serious action against Cuba.

On July 22, 1965, MM T-1, an individual who is

personally acquainted with leading members of the LPN,

advised that during the past 2 years he had conferred

on numerous occasions with ACOSTA and other members of

the organization, concerning their military plans, but

nothing had ever developed and MM T-1 had reached the

conclusion that this organization has little, if any,

potential for military action. He pointed out that the

LPW lacks experience, military equipment, and adequate

means of transportation. He advised he has no evidence

the LPM has any immediate plans for action against Cuba.

On July 23, 1965, MM I-2, a Cuban exile who has

been active in Cuban revolutionary matters in the Miami

area for the past 5 years, advised that ZACARIAS ACOSTA,

former Mayor of Regla, Cuba, is closely associated with

- former members of the BATISTA regime and has obtained some

money and other contributions from these persons over the

past 2 years, and has accumulated some military equipment.

MM T-2 said that LPN is a very small group, it

hopes to accomplish some military action against Cuba, but
