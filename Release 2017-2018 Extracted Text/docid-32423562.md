claims that his father, in

1970, gave him FBI furnished

dossiers on Warren Commission critics.

Facts: A. At the request of Marvin, Watson in 1966,

the FBI furnished him with background memos on seven

writers critical of the Warren Commission. Included as

part of this transmission was a photograph of one of the

seven writers in a situation best described as "well, uh,

private," perverse and utterly without any value, save the

sexually deviate. (The SSC staff refused to even look at

the picture, but has received verbal and written

description.)

B. In January 1975, Tom Boggs, son of the late

Congressman Hale Boggs, disclosed that in 1970, his father

received similar dossiers and the picture.

The FBI and Boggs documentary material (the FBI

denies a dissimination to Boggs) compare only slightly and

two similarly typed dossiers are dated differently. We

await information from FBI on further dissimination.

INFORMIATION CONCERNING WASHINGTON STAR NEWS

ARTICLE, JANUARY 31. 1975. REGARDING HALE BOGGS'

SON CLAIMING POSSESSION OF FILES ON WARREN

COMMISSION CRITICS

The Washington Slar News, a Washington, D. C., daily news-

paper, carried an article in the January 31, 1975, edition, page A-4,

under an Associated F'ress release capüoned "Boggs' Son Tells of Files

on Warren Panel." The article quotes l'om Il. Boggs, Ji., son of the

Late Representative Hale Boggs, as claiming that in 1970 his father gave

Lini dossiers which the FBI compiled on critics of the Warren Commission

in an attempt to discredit them. According to the article, Boggs' son

stated "they weren't basically sex files. They had some of that element

but most of the matcrial dcalt with leit wing organizations these people

belonged to."

TonI HI. Boggs, Jr., declined to identify all seven of the critical

authors but stated that writer Edward Jay Epstein and lawyer Mark Lane

were among the individuals on whon he had imormation. Boggs: Jr.

reportedly stated that the information given hinr by his lather included a

photograph of one of the seven engaging in all unnatural sex act with two

women.

In a review of Bureau files no evidence was found that any

information of this nature was ever disseminated directly to Hale Boggs..

from the FBL

some a rowever, the sured me firew ucates that on Novender 8.

1966, memoranda were furnished to Marvin Watson, Special Assistant to

President Johnson, at the White House, at his request, setting forth pertinent

information contained in Bureau files regarring background on seven individuals

who wrote untavorable articles concerning the Warren Commission lindings.

The seven individuals mentioned in the memorandum to

MI. Watson were Edward Jay Epstein: Joachim Joesten; Penn Jones, Jr.;

Mark Lane; Richard I1. Popkin; Leo Sauvage; Harold Weisberg.

In a cover letter to Mr. Watson he was advised that Bureau

files contained no pertinent data with respect to Sylvan Fox, an author

critical of the investigation surrounding President Kennedy's assassina-

tion.

In addition to background information regarding the seven critics

of the Warren Commission, we disseminated to Mr. Watson at the White

House one facial photograph of cr

Regarding the dissemination concerning a we

reccived information that in 1962 the District Attorney of Queens County,

New York, conducted an investigation of;

At that time statements irom tvo women were received along with an

obscene photograph of Cp and hand printed instruction which cragave

to one of the girls in order that they could perform upon his person

perverted sexual acts of a sadistic masochistic nature.

The background information furnished to the White House

-regarding Mark Lane indicated that he is an attorney, born in New Yorks

City on February 24, 1927, and that he has a long history of affiliation

with Communist Party front groups and organizations which have been

cited as subversive.

The 'Daily Worker" for May 27, 1953. states that the National

in May, 1902, he was defeated in an attempt to secure the nomination as

a candidate for United States House of Representatives from the 10th

with Lane's attempt to secure this nomination that a meeting of the

Manhattan County Communist Party Coordinating Committee was held

on April 5, 1962, to discuss election problems in the 19th Congressional

District.

It was reported that the speaker at this meeting stated that the

Committee had to support Mark Lane as the candidate since his views

were most consistent with the "people's program." The speaker

further indicated that a victory for Lane would be a tremendous victory .

for the progressive movement.

In the Washington Star News article the name of Edward Jay

Epstein was also mentioned by Tom H. Boggs, Ji. According to Bureau.

ION BOSSA

Ico Sauvage was born on February 23, 1913, at

Nancy, France.

In 1934 he was reported as a correspondent and

chief of the New For's Eureau of "Le Populaire," a French socialist

newspaper. He also has been reported as a correspondent for the

Frcich publication "Le rigaro.

Il 1951'it was reportod that Cauvare was a member of

a small group of individuals close to Louis Dolivet who was relised

reentry to the Crited dates due to his suspected communist eind

Comintern background.

In October, 1953, information was received that Leo

Sauvage, 'Le Figaro," 50 Rockefeller Flaza, New York City, re-

sponded to an irvintion encuded by the folish Consulate, Now York

City, to attend a showing of the Polish film, "Peace Will Win," to be

shown on November 30, 1951, at the liuseum of Modern Art, New York

City.

According to a statement filed with the Department of

Justice, Foreign Agents Registration section, the French Eress Agency

(FPA) In Jonuary, 1954, listed Leo Sauvace, 270 West End Avenue,

New York Cit:, as an einployee of that agency. In May, 1954, while

Sauvage was still employed by the iPA, it was reported that the chief

of the Washington Bureau of the soviet Tass News Agency utilized

France. It is not lown if this individual is identical with captioned autor.

The March, 1934, issue of "Commentary," a monthly

VITEVAST - TIE REPORT ON THE COME FROM

WARREN REPORT"

BY

HAROLD WEISBERG

FCO-•1SI0

Tom Bose

Haroli Weisberg, the author of the above-captioned boo!s,

and his wife, Lillian Stone weisbers, jointly own a liacre tract of land

in Ilyattstown, Maryland, tyon which they operate the cog d'Or Farm

whose principal business is raising of pheasant-chickens, Rock-Cornish

game hens, waterfowl and other poulry and the sale of poultry and eggs.

Harold Wcisberg was an eroployee of the La Tollette Civil

Liberties Committee from september, 1956, to October, 1050, and was

discharged for permitting certain inforration to ieak io the press.

Senator La Follette stated that Weisberg had been dismissed for a

breach of trust involving the release of confidential information to a news-

paper and the donator was quite certain the newopaper involied was

"The Daily Worler," a former east coast communist newspaper.

Weisherg was one of 10 employees fired summarily by

the State Department in June, 1947, because of suspicion of being a

cominunist or having communistic sympathies. He was later allowed to

resign without prejudice, but was not restored to his position. His wife,

Lillian Stone Weisberg, was investigated under the provisions of

Executive Order 9625 in 1048 and the Civil Service Commission advised

in October, 1918, that she had been retained. At that time, she was a

clerk in the leconstruction Finance Corporation. Her name had been carried

on the active list of memvers of the washington Eoo!s shop ¿ssociation

and the Washington Committee for Democratic Action during December,

1917. The Washington Eook Shop Association and the Washington ommittee

for Democratic Action have both been cited by the Department of Justice

as subversive.

During an undisclosed period, but presumably in the 1950's,

it was ascertaincd that Petr I. Pogodin, a foreign ministry employee of

the Russian Embassy in Washington, J. C., was in contact with Harold

Weisberg at his form. Weisberg had previously extended an invitation to

Loach — Pogo lin to visit his farm: and it was also determined that logodin had

It was ascertalned in September, 1959, that Wolsberg

asked Petr N. Yelleyev, Taird Secretary of the loviet Embassy in

Washington, D. C., for information on Loviet reaction to the proposal

that his chickens be placed in competition with Russian poultry.

In 1956, it was alleged that Weisberg held an annual

celebration of the Mussian levolution. 'This celebration involved a

picnic at his residence and was aitended by 25 to 30 uninown people.

It was believed this afair was in commemoration of the Russian devolu-

tion inasmuch as it was held on the day when the communists celebrate

all over the world.

In 1961, Weisberg and his wife filed a claim against the

Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act in the amount of 50, 250

for damages allegecly sustained by them in their povitry business as a

result of low-flying helicopters. This case was tried and couri directed

Anderson now believes there is some authenticity

Garrison told Anderson!

that he will undoubiedly hold a full-scale trial within six

months.

Basically, Garrison told Anderson that the entire

also conceived the idea of sending oswald to lexico in a fake

attenot to obtain permission to re-enter the Soviet Union.

Garrison, according to Ancerson, can plove that Oswald did this

merely to establish a

good atmospherc so that he could gain

ready access to Cuba.

Garrison claims that it was at this point that oswald

becaine disillusioned and refused to go through with the plot

Upon icturning to lew Orleans from

Shaï and Ferrie, being

guided by soveral Cubans in their midst, then conceived the

idea (mostly because of the liasco at. the Bay of Pigs) of

assassinating President kennedy.

Ferrie and

Shaw believed

Ithat Oswald could be the "patsi

¡'Dallas for the purpose of the assassination.

They also engineered the idea of him buying the

gun under the name of A. J. Hidell, and the use of the nails

in procuring this gun so that it would be an owen, public

record which could be traced to Oswald. They additionally told

Oswald that he should keep certain

papers in his possession

¡which would trace back to the gun.

On the day of the assassination, Ferrie traveled to

Ruby

sent two of his people to Houston so that, upon the success of

the assassination attempt, these two people could use a local

Garrison

clains that a long distance phone call from Dallas to Houston

could, of course, have been traced; hence the desirability of

using

the local phone.

Anderson sated that Ruby was definiteir

Hi. Tolson

Anderson next sprang the "Sixty-lour dollar question."

He stated that at the

close of Garrison's six-hour recitation

of facts, ne (Anderson) was of the opinion that Garrison was not

only sincerc, but vory convincing.

Anderson stated that Garrison

firmly believed his facts.

Anderson then told me that he bluntly

lasked Garrison why Garrison had not given

all these convincing

facts to the FBI, Whereupon Garrison replied, "I got started off

¡on the wrong foot with the FBl."

Garrison added, "I would be

Imore than willing to give the fBI everything i have and let

I'them finish the investigation if they so desire."

Anderson told me that he, of course, is now in a

iposition to contact Garrison and indicate that the FBl vill or

will not take over this case.

I told Anderson that the rI

would not under any circumstances take over the case. I stated

that Garrison had made it quite plain that he did not want the

cooperation of the FBI and, as a matter of fact, Garrison had

threatened to put handcuffs on any of our agents who approached

illhim for information.

I

also told inderson that, while we of course would

accept any information that was voluntarily given

at the same tine would not tale over Garrison's "dirty laundry."

Anderson told me that if the Bureau had any change of

policy in the above regard he would appicciate Inowing about it.

I told him ve would koep his offer in mind; however, there

definitely would be no change of policy.

Anderson also toid me that he had discussed this

entire matter with George Christian,

the President's_Press

secretary, at the inte

House.

that Christian was

¡also convinced that there must be some truth to Garrison's

allegations.

Christian told Anderson to get in touch with

the

¡FBI.

Anderson stated he had already been planning to do this,

that he now especially wanted to advise us of the

'full

¡facts because of Christian's request.

connection, Marvin watson calied ne inte

Mr. TOlSOn

Iin this connection would be most appreciated by him and the

President.

I reminded Matson that the Director had sent over

to the White House some weeks back all the information in

OUr

possession in connection with CIA's attempts to use

former agent Robert Maheu and his private detective outfit

in contacts with Sain Giancana and other hoodlums, relative to

fostering a plot to assassinate Castro. Watson stated this

was true and he remembered our memorandum in this regard, but

that if we had anything eise we should by all meins forward

it to the Whiic House.

I told him we had no further informa

tion in this regard.

to masturbate after the enera vas completely in hin and he

wasn't supposed to relleve hieself until after he masturbated

but he clained be had to rclieve himself and he did; and then

when Mark came back into the room the next thing on the

do it and a comment was made by either Miss Stevens or myself

that the tests can't continue unless he does 1i, so then lee

insated a candle into his anus and then I believe, she beat

him again, I am not positive. Then lee having read the

Instruction sheet with de suggested the obscene pictures.

we both did 1e." about this point colden sald Lane sald

It was tou embarrassing for hin to masturbate or sosething

THOLAS G. BUCILANAN

Self-admitted Communist Thomas G. Buchanan has written articles

published here In the u.S. and

abroad: discrediting she Warren Commission

Report. He is author of the book: "Who Killed Kennedy?" published in

London and distributed here

In 1965. The book was favorably reviewed in the

Cotarunist press.

In 1949, Buchanan was fired from the staff of a Washington newspaper

for being a Communist Party nenber and is now a frequent contributor to left-

Wing newspapers and periodicals. He currently makes his home in Paris.

While in this country he was Executive Secretary and Legislative

Dizector. of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), a cited Coumunist front.

The Report and Order of the Board, Subversive Activities Control

Board Docket #106-53, July 26, 1957, page 7, contained the following Information

concerning Tom Buchanan:

"Washington, D.C. Area -- Approximately one month after the

CRC/Civil Rights. Congress/ founding convention, a party

leadership meeting was caled in this area to build CRC.

Petitioner's witness, Markward, the then

Party tressurer,

was assigned to audit CRC books.

Thereafter, in 1948, the Party decided that its member

Marie Richardson would be the full-time Party functionary

in CRC.

Shortly thereafter Richardson left town temporarily,

and Party member Ion Buchanan was placed in her stead on a

full-time basis and relieved of all other Party dutles."

In consideration of materials available on Thomas Buchanan, it is

evident that he is a dedicated and obedient Party functionary employed by the

Party as a propagandist.

MARK LiNNE

Mark Lane, lawyer and author, is a 41-year-old former New York

State Assenblyman.

He has a long and curlous involvement with a host

of extreme left-wing causes and is a well-established spokesman for leftist

Ideology.

Lane is former executive secretary and national board member

nf the National Lawyers Guild, a cited Communist front. His affiliation

with the New York Council to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee

1s likewise well known. This past year he was a member of the Cormittee of

Sponsors for a Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade dinner. The VALB is

also a cited Communist front.

MI. Lane, according

to public record, is against: Nuclear testing

by this country; hearings of the house Cornittee on Un-American Activities;

building of nuclear fallout shelters in New York state; The Internal Security

Act of 1950; banning Cormunists from speaking on college campuses;

using

nounted police to control cormunist-manipulated demonstrators in New York City;

and, the Comerce Department ban on shipment of food and drugs to Cuba.

When General Suharto was successful in ridding his country

of Communists, the youth arm of the Irotskyist-communist Workers World Party

Icsponded

with a nock "inquest" in New York City. Mark lone was there to

address them and was applauded for his views.

In an address

at a rally in New York City In 1962, Lane stated:

"I balieve that the anti-democratic attacks on the Communist

Party are just as much a part of the psychological mobilization

for war as is the shelter p ogram. Laws like the McCarran Act

must be fought because they are inherently and basically un-

Americin In the only neoning in which that word makes sense;

and they must be fought because they are past of the tendency

HAROLD WEI SERG

According to press Icleases of the Special Committce to Invegtigate

paid $100 for forged letters which were used in an attempt to link then chairman

Martin Dies to the militant "Silver Shirts," an extremist group. (The Silver Shirt

Legion of America was a klan hate-type organization which adopted a policy of

depriving certain ethnic groups and individuals of their constitutional rights.).

Weisberg, after

obtaining this forged correspondence, used it in & January 27, 1940

Issue of the "Nation." Additionally, according to the press releases, Weisberg

used the bogus letters to write a speech for a congressman who addressed the mis-

Information to the Congress.

Weisberg; according to press accounts, was earlier (1938) discharged from

his. investigator post on

the LaFollette civil liberties committee "for giving

confidential matter to the Daily Worker, the leading Coumunist newspaper in the

country."

In the summer of 1947, Weisberg was flred from his post with the U.s.

Department of State along with nine others

for "known association with agents

of the Soviet Union."

Weisberg has appeared several times before the New Orleans grand jury

investigating the Kennody assassination plot alleged to have occurred in that city.

His latest book

on the assassination carries a foreword by District Attorney Janes

Garrison.

An interesting sidelight on Harold Weisberg is found In the summary of

district court proceedings (193 F.Supp. 815 (1961)). Welsberg, a Frederick, Md.,

chicken, farmer, successfully sued the Ünited States for 750 dollars In 1961.

The

Judge (Thomsen) awarded weisberg damages even though "... Harold Weisberg was not,

In try opinion,

a trustworthy witness. He exaggerated Icpcatedly...," the Judge found.

Weisberg, 1t scens, was suing the federal Government because of

low-flying training helicopters which were scaring his chickens, causing them

to cat their own eggs, and generally making

then unfit for market. However,

four of Weisberg's neighbors, who also raised chickens, "...testified that

neither they nor their chickens had been disturbed by any low flight..."

Earlier, in 1959, he lost a similar suit which had to do with

sonic booms:

On December 16, 1966, Harold Weisberg discussed his book on the

Milltant Forus, a program conducted by"The Militant", official organ of the

Trotskyist-communist Socialist Workers Party.

MARK LANE

Mark Lane, an attorney, was born in New York City on

February 24, 1927. He served in the U. S. Army from May 1, 1945,

o November 12, 1946, when he was honorably discharged with the

rank of Private First Class. Mark Lane has a long history oi affil-

iation with Communist Party (CP) front groups and organizations

which have been cited as subversive.

The "Daily Worker" for May 27, 1953, stated that the

National Lawyers Guild (NLG) held an election of officers on May 26,

1953, and that Mark Lane was elected an ex officio member of the

Board of Directors of the NLG. The "Daily Worker" was an east

coast communist newspaper which is no longer being published.

Reportedly, a membership list of the New York Chapter

of the NLG in June, 1953, included Lane's name and at that time it

appeared he was a subscriber to the "Lawyers Guild Review, " the

official publication of the NLG. Lane reportedly spoke at a member-

ship meeting of this organization on May 17, 1961. He was listed as

co-chairman of the National Committee of the Integration of the Legal

Profession of the NLG in the May 15, 1964, issue of "Newsletter,"

a publication of the NLG.

The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA)

has described the NG as the foremost legal bulwark of the Communist

Party.

Mark Lane was the featured speaker at the annual ceremonies

of the Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs (ELF) on

July 25, 1961, at New York City. The ELF is recognized by the Communist

Party, USA, as an important progressive organization for women. It grew

out of the Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order of the International Workers

Order, both of which have been designated pursuant to Executive Order

10450.

Lane spoke at a meeting of the Emergency Civil

Liberties Committee (ECLC) on October 21, 1962, in New York

City. He strongly supported Cuba and its government and con-

demned American policy relating to Cuba. The ECLC has been

cited by the HUA as an organization operating as a communist

front.

Lane was elected to the New York State Assembly in

1960, and in May, 1962, he was defeated in an attempt to secure

the nomination as candidate for United States House of Representa-

tives from the 19th Congressional District in New York. With re-

gard to Lane's service in the New York State Assembly,

"The

Militant"' for December 18, 1961, carried an article which related

to Lane's appearance at a rally in New York on December 6, 1961.

Lane reportedly stated that his first official action during the com-

ing session of the Assembly would be to introduce a resolution to

persuade the U. S. Congress to abolish the HCUA. "The Militant"

is a weekly newspaper of the Socialist Workers Party which has

been designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

Mark Lane has been strongly opposed to the House

Committee on Un-American Activities. During the early 1960's,

he was very active in the New York Council to Abolish the House

Un-American Activities Committee (NYCAHUAAC) and made

numerous speeches in New York and other areas of the country

in support of the aims of this organization.

The NYCAHUAAC is an affiliate of the National

Council to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee

and both were founded principally by an individual who was a

Communist Party (CP) member in 1952. It has been reported

that CP members in the New York City area have been solicited

on various occasions to support the NYCAHUAAC.

A rally was held at Columbia University, New York

City, on November 6, 1961, in protest to the University's ban

against the appearance of several communist speakers at that

school. The principal speakers at this rally were Mark Lane

and Benjamin J. Davis, National Secretary of the Communist

Party.

On August 6, 1965, Mark Lane was a featured

speaker before a meeting of the Militant Labor Forum of the

Socialist Party in New York City. His topic at that time

related to the Cuban Revolution and he pointed out that the

communist government in Cuba is best for citizens of that

country and that the Cuban people had embraced communism

because it was the only way open to them when the United

States refused to negotiate. He also criticized American

military action in Vietnam. The Socialist Workers Party has

been designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

Lane has been highly critical of American

policies in Vietnam and has spoken at various anti-Vietnam

rallies and meetings.

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

On February 12, 1964, a meeting was held at

San Diego which was sponsored by the San Diego Neighborhood

Forum, the name under which the Communist Party sponsored

public meetings in that area. This meeting was also sponsored

by the Friends of the "National Guardian."

Mark Lane was a

featured speaker at this meeting. The "National Guardian" has

been cited by the HCUA as having manifested itself as a virtual

official propaganda arm of the Soviet Union.

Mark Lane was involved in an extensive public

speaking tour in 1964 on behalf of the "National Guardian."

He spoke concerning his knowledge of and inquiry into the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Lane was, at

that time, Chairman of the Citizens Committee of Inquiry, a

Harvey Oswald, to represent her dead son before the Warren

Commission.

During his speaking tour in 1964, Lane addressed

several meetings of the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs in various parts

of the country.

The W.E.B. DuBois Clubs is a communist youth

organization which was conceived by the Communist Party, USA,

and is currently being operated and controlled by the Communist

Party.

A Reuter's press dispatch dated April 6, 1964,

at Budapest, reported that Mark Lane, an attorney from New York,

appeared before the Congress of the International Association of

Democratic Lawyers in Budapest, at which time he asked for the

creation of an international commission to be entrusted with the

investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy. At this

meeting he made various statements that the official theory of

the assassination of the President was false. It is noted the

International Association of Democratic Lawyers has been cited

as an international communist-front organization in the "Guide

to Subversive Organizations and Publications, " revised and

published December 1, 1961, by the Committee Oi Un-American

Activities, U. S. House of Representatives, Washington, D. C.

Mark Lane is the author of the book entitled,

"Rush to Judgment," published in August, 1966. He claims

it is : "A critique of the Warren Commission's inquiry into the

murder of President John F. Kennedy, Officer J. D. Tippit,

and Lee Harvey Oswald." It is considered to be a cleverly

contrived piece of literature designed to discredit the President's

Commission and its findings. During 1967, Lane traveled exten-

sively in Europe in connection with publicizing his book and with

the distribution of the film version of this book. At a press

conference in Vienna, Austria, on February 27, 1967, Lane

accused President Johnson and the Dallas, Texas, Police

Department of engaging in a conspiracy to block the "investi-

gation" being conducted into the assassination of President

Kennedy by James Garrison, District Attorney, New Orleans,

Louisiana. He frequently stated that he intended to help

Garrison in the latter's investigation.

On June 14, 1967, Mark Lane spoke at the

University of California at Los Angeles and urged all yersons io

aid James Garrison financially in his "investigation" of the Kennedy

assassination in order that Garrison might be free of harassment

by the FBI and other Federal agencies.

In November, 1967, it was determined that Mark

Lane had moved from his residence at 178 Spring Street, New

York City, New York, and was then residing at Apartment 4,

617 Dauphine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana.

affiliating himself with James Garrison, District Attorney,

New Orleans, Louisiana, in connection with Garrison's "investi-

gation" into the assassination of President Kennedy.

MISCELLANEOUS

"The New York Times" of June 9, 1961, reported

that Lane had been arrested at Jackson, Mississippi, on June 8,

1961, as a member of a group of "Freedom Riders" who had been

taken into custody in that city. He was convicted of breach of the

peace in the City Court on June 8, 1961, and sentenced to four

months' confinement and a $200 fine, with two moatis of the jail

sentence suspended. This conviction was subsequently overturned

in the County Court at Jackson and Lane was acquitted.

It was reported in the April 3, 1962, issue of "The

New York Times" that Mark Lane had been fined $415 on April 2,

1962, in New York City, as a "scofflaw" for ignoring numerous

traffic tickets.

On July 4, 1963, Lane was arrested by the

Baltimore County Police

Department at Towson, Maryland, in

connection with participating in a civil rights demonstration. The

disposition of this arrest is not known.

The Office of the District Attorney, Queens County,

New York, conducted an investigation of Lane in 1962 for alleged

sodomy. In connection with this investigation, statements were

taken from two women by the District Attorney's Office which

related to obscene activities on the part of Lane. An obscene

photograph of Lane and handwritten instructions by Lane relating

to alleged perverted sexual acts of a sadistic and masochistic

nature performed by the women on the person of Lane were aiso

obtained during this investigation.
