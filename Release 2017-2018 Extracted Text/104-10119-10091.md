taken - the employment concerned. Mr. George was further Informed

of the element of embarrassment we saw in this situation and which

led us to disapprove Hunt's request In the f1rst place and was also

been made aware previously that the Office of Security had dis

approved any request from Hunt concerning his wife's employment

and that he considered all of the points put forward by the vriter

on behalf of the Office.of Security to be valid and well taken.

explored. He requested that he be given 48 hours - and then said

by the end of the week - within which to arrange matters with the

DDP and requested further that Security not send through 1ts letter

on this matter until the proposed meeting could be had. He left

agreed to pass this information and request to Mr. Bannerman.

seemed to be fully aware of the situation, the writer did tell Mr.
