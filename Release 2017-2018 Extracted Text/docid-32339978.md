ANTI-RACKETEERING

Re Havana letter to the Bureau dated October 12, 1959.

HAV-33, who maintains constant contact with the casinos

in Havana, has advised on several occasions that the gambling

business is very poor due to the lack of tourist trade. The

large ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents) convention which

was in session in Havana on October 21, 1959, when the alleged

"bombing" of Havana took place by, planes based in the United states,

was expected to greatly increase the tourist trade; however,

following the alleged "bombing" prime Minister FIDEL CASTRO

lashed out in very bitter attacks on the United States and a

very negative impression was created on a majority of the ASTA -

delegates present in Cuba.

It has been observed by SA Edwin L. Sweet on several

occasions

that there are practically no hotel guests and no

American players present in the gambling casinos of the Hotels

Capri, Hilton, Nacional and Riviera.

HA7-33 has

the Tropicana Night club. Havande, Cuba

gambling business is also very poor at the Hotel Komodued that

Cubes.

It was publicly announced in the newspapers over

week-end of November 21, 1959, that the Hotel Riviera was inter-

vened by the Cuban Revolutionary Government.

*it was known and

has been reported that the Hotel Riviera was operating at a large

loss and the Cuban Government refused to allow the hotel to release

any of its employees or curtail in any way the night shows and

entertainment offered at the hotel®

had a medium size crowd but they were all playing very small stakes

and the players were entirely made up of cuband.

On October 30, 1959, HAV-33 reported that on October 25,

1959, at about 10 p.m.,

DINO CELLINI had been observed at the Hotel

Riviera restaurant

dining with an individual known as "Gallego"

ANGELITO GONZALEZ. HAV-33 was unable to determine the nature of

this conversation but stated GONZALEZ is well known as a crook

and is presently employed at one of the dice tables in the casino

at the Hotel Hilton.

Curibas

HAV-33 also reported that he had heard from several sources

in the casinos that efforts were being made to establish a gambling

setup at Port-au-Prince, i

Haiti, but he had been unable to verify

that gambling is actually underway there.

He had heard that LEFTY

CLARK,..

FBI #1721507, had gone to Port-au-prince for the purpose of

assisting in setting up a gambling casino there. It will be recalled

that CLARK was formerly connected with the casino at the Tropicana

Night Club in Havana. Aunt

On November 11, 1959, HAV-31 stated that the LANSKY

brothers would be delighted to

"unload" the Hotel Riviera and

gambling casino on any

"sucker" who would buy it but he had no

information indicating that a serious offer for the sale of the

same was under consideration.

He stated that unless the gambling

business improved considerably in Havana many of the big time

gamblers would soon be pulling out.

HAV-31 stated there is a "big fellow" with a mustache whose

first name is MARK (LNU) who formerly operated at the casino

St. Johns Hotel who is now reported to be handling a deal for the

opening of a large gambling casino in Puerto Rico.

MARK is handling this deal for MIKErCHANEY or at

is fronting for the operation. HAV-31 could furnish no concrete

information as to the identity of the owners at the Hotel Nacional

casino but stated he believed a "big time" operator in New York

actually is the owner of the casino and may be the money behind the

setup in Puerto Rico. This source did not believe the casino in

Puerto Rico would be ready for operation before October, 1960.

On November 21, 1959, PCI Arthur Newman advised there is a

about 1200 people near the Hilton Hotel

in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and he understood that MIKE MCLANEY is

fronting for the establishment of a gambling casino there. This

source thought the casino might be in operation shortly after the

Christmas holidays in order to take advantage of some of the present

winter tourist trade.

November 5, 1959, PCI Alberto Suarez Aleman reported

that SANTO/TRAFFICANTE was departing the following day for. Tampa,

Florida, for the alleged purpose of tending to some business and

bringing his wife back to Cuba; however, on November 23, 1959, source

advised that TRAFFICANTE apparently had some difficulty

over a tax

deal at Tampa and he had still not returned.

On November 25, 1959, HAV-33 reported that TRAFFICANTE had

gone to Tampa and had been involved in some difficulty regarding his

taxes. HAV-33 also reported that as of November 23,

1959,. JACK

LANSKY continues to be out of Cuba and informant believed

he was

making some final financial arrangements withhis brother, MEYER LANSKY,

concerning their business at the Hgtel Riviera and the gambling casino

which has been intervened by the Cuban Government.

HAV-33 concluded that on November 23, 1959, he ascertained

that the Hotel Capri has 40 guests and a visit

to the casino on that

night reflected no players in the casino.

Extra copies of this letter have been prepared for forwarding

by the Bureau to the New York, Miami and San Juan offices.

The activities of American gamblers operating in Havana will

continue to be followed and if any of the important gambling casinos

are closed, the same will be promptly reported to the Bureau.
