INFORMANT COVERAGE:

The following informants and confidential sources

of the Dallas Office are being utilized in coverage of the

subject's

activities, associates,

etc.

DL- 95-C

DL-170-C

DI- 140-C

DL-105-C

DI- 122-C

PCI JOSEPH N. FERRARI

PCI WILLIAM W. PETREE

JEROME J. CRANE, Confidential Source who is

funeral director handling

most of the Italian funerals in Dallas.

Mr. R. A. BURROW, Chief Special Agent, Southwestern

Bell Telephone Co., Dallas - confidential source.

It is believed by the Dallas Office that the

informant coverage of the subject is adequate and

should

he become involved in any possible violation of a Federal

statute or should he expand his present bookmaking operation,

it is believed this information will become known to the

Dallas Office through the above informant and

source coverage.

A review of investigation conducted to date in

this matter by Dallas and auxiliary offices has failed to

develop any information that the subject is operating across

state lines or is involved in any known violation of any

Federal statute.

Results of this negative investigation

conducted by Dallas and auxiliary offices is not being set

out in this report but is being maintained in the files of

the Dallas Office.

It will be noted there is an overlap in the

investigative period of this report due to the fact that

information was received from auxiliary offices after the

submission of the last report.

The extensive investigative period of this report

has been noted by the Dallas Office, however, it was desired

that the submission of a mere status report be avoided and

that investigation requested by auxiliary offices and necessary

investigation at Dallas be completed prior to the submission

of report in order to ascertain if further investigative

activity by Dallas is necessary in this matter.
