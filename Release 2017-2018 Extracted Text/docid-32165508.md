very concerned over the assassination of President KENNEDY

and the involvement of OshAld, who was connected with the

Fair Play for Cuba Committee ! (FPCC) •

Although she did not

indicate which organism of the PCM had reached this decision,

It 1s to be noted that MORA was a member of the so-called

Leadership Branch of the PCM.

She stated that the PCM had

decided that there were only four Americans in Mexico who

might possibly be Involved in FPCC operations as far as

the Mexican police might know:

ASA ZATZ (Bufile 105-16890),

CHARLES SMALL, and the intormants.

As the Bureau is aware,

the informants came to the

attention of the Mexican authorities when HELEN LEVI TRAVIS

(BufIle 100-336032), who was admittedly a member of the FPCC,

was arrested and deported in November, 1962. At that time,

the Mexican police found the informants® home address anc

telephone number in

TRAVIS" motel room and it was necessary

for the informants to go into hiding until the Mexican police

gave up efforts to interview them

on 11/23/63, MORA advised the informants that 1f

any action was taken against them by the Mexican police,

they should immediately get In touch with JUAN MANUEL

GUTIERREZ, the Mexico City attorney whom the Informants had

previously been Instructed to contact in case they were

arrested for political reasons yu)

Under the above circumstances, therefore, any

request of the Mexican police to interview SMALL on the basis

of his relations with members of the FPCC would focus the

• Consideration has also been given to calling SMALL,

who 1s an American citizen, Into the Embassy for interview.

It is not felt, however, that such action would be advisable

since any interrogation

by Embassy personnel, Including this

office, would necessarily have to be predicated on informa sIl

tion from MEX-18 and MEX-19. which would jeopardize the

Informants the same as 1f done by the Mexican police

The informants have also advised that SMALL has

a heart condition, claims to have suffered a slight heart

attack while in the United States In September, 1963, and 18

in poor health.

Information received from CIA, Mexico, clas-

sified "SECRET" and

not to be disseminated outside the Bureau,

also confirms SMALL's reported heart condition and his

frequent claims that he has to be very careful not to aggra-

vate It. An aggressive interview of SMALL by either the (aLU.

Mexican police or American personnel might either percipitate

nother heart attack or cause the subject to claim another suci

attack and accuse the Bureau of being responsible lor it.&

In addition to the above factors, the Mexico City

Office has no Information to show that such an interview,

either by the Mexican police or the American officers would

be productive.

Available sources have given no Indication

that SMALL actually ever knew or saw OSWALD. His claim that

ne must have known OskALD at some time and that he might

nave met oSWALd in Mexico was, according to NEX-1o and MEX-19,

6[4]

based on the fact that many American communists visiting

Mexico go to SMALL's store and that he assists them in con-

nection with their problems while visiting Mexico City

SMALL, however, has given no indication that he

recognized OSWALD from the newspaper pictures printed in

Mexico City or recognized his name as being one of the

visitors at his store.

The informants have reported that

following the assassination of President KENNEDY and the

public identification of OSWALD's leftist. connections with

"ing pölice harrassment of all leftists.

They considered

MALI's concern over the possibility that ÖSWALD might have

visited his store to be part of the general concern of all

American communists here after' reading that OSWALD had beer

contrary.U

In light of the above, the Mexico City Office does

not believe that an interview of SMALl should be undertaken

by either Mexican or American officials. U
