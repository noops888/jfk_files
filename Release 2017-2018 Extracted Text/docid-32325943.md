large withdrawal made during June, 1960, was a check in the

amount oi $6, 300 dated 6/13/60, payable to subject's wife,

OLGA FABREGA.

The remainder of the withdrawals in June

consisted of checks for rent, utilities and miscellaneous

expenses and checks in

• small

amounts payable to various

deposited to subject's

account and withdrawals in the amount

of $4,945.68, leaving a balance as of 7/29/60 of $1,503.49.

Four of the deposits during July, 1960, were items

of approximately $1,000 or more and efforts will be made to

further identify these deposits.

The withdrawals during July, 1960, showed two

amounts of $800 each payable to LAA on 7/20

and 28/60,

respectively.

The remainder of the withdrawals were

relatively

small checks made payable to cash and to

various relatives of the subject.

The above information às well as that previously

obtained from the monitoring of subject's personal checking

account is not set forth in the report since it is not

believed pertinent to this investigation.

value of the information so derived to date has been of a

lead nature of possible assistance in locating additional

bank accounts of the subject.
