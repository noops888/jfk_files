Case ID #:

62-HQ-1029205 (Pending)

Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act

of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review

Board (ARRB) to oversee the government's production and

compliance with the Act.

The ARRB reviews the proposed

postponements in documents sent by each agency to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and decides what

postponements the Act will allow or opens the document in full.

The ARRB's responsibilities include having agencies search other

subjects and areas to find additional material not already

identified as assassination records.

The establishment of the

ARRB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be

accomplished.

The ARRB must complete their tasks by September

1998.

With this deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter

requesting additional information.

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material.

Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish

the intentions of the Act.

If New

York is

aware of any administrative records they may have

maintained outside the normal index system, they should include

those areas in the search.

If any documents related to the

matters are found, please forward the documents to the JFK Task

Force.

Pursuant to the Act, any material categorized

as an

assassination record must be' sent to the NARA in its original

form.
