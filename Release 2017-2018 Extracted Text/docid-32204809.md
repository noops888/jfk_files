DOCUMENTS FROM DPD FILES RELATED TO

CUBAN OPERATIONS DURING THE PERIOD 1959 - 1961

Today, May 21, 1975, Joe Seltzer furnished me a

group of documents, totaling about one-quarter inch in thick-

ness, which were compiled by Frank A. Daly of the DDO. . These

are the documents described in paragraph two of the May 15,

1975, memorandum from the Agency entitled "AMB Research of

DPD

Files

Related to Cuban Operations."

Paragraph two of this memo

reads: "A number of documents were found that referred to the

intent on the part of some Cuban teams operating inside Cuba to

attempt to assassinate Castro. ..Also, there is mention of the

air drop of Springfield rifles with telescopic sights."

Items of interest in this group of documents

are as follows:

1.

Memorandum for the record, unsigned, undated,

Subject:

"First Meeting of Branch Four Task Force, 9 March

1960. "

This memo outlines the meeting of the Branch Four

Group which apparently was to concern itself with covert

operations against Cuba.

The memo relates that Colonel King

gave a briefing at this meeting, one aspect of which was as

follows:

"He said that unless Fidel and Raul Castro and "Che"

Guevara could be eliminated in one package--which is highly

unlikely--this operation can be a long, drawn out affair and

tor Present government will only be overthrown by the use of

There are no other references in this memo to elimina-

tion or assassination of Castro.

It appears to be a general

discussion of necessary support for covert operations against

Cuba.

to JMADD.

2.

Cable, dated August 30, 1960, from Headquarters

This cable reads as follows:

"1.

Attempting obtain one helio. Expect

this to fulfill all operational and emer-

RE REF B PARA 2B Do not approve.

Justification assignment this acft for

strict operational and emergency."

3. Cable, dated April 4, 1961, to BELL IrOm RIMM.

This cable

written in Spanish, appears to be a reouest fron

an agent within Cuba that certain equipment be air-dropped to

him.

Among the items requested in this cable, are one .50-

caliber machine gun, two boxes of Springfields with telescopic

sights, plus

other weapons and rockets.

4. Cable, dated March 27, 1961, to BELL and RIMM.

This appears to be another message from an agent

within Cuba.

Written in Spanish, it is translated as follows:

"March 23 I told Luis Bueno to ask you

opinion regarding sabotage Cia. Electricidad

(electric company) in order to leave Havana

ten days without power.

We can coordinate

with attempt against Fidel in public appear-

ance (at) Sports Palace. Suggest attempt

against Fidel in accordance with general

plan.

Light and Fidel possibly can be

coordinated with Pinar del Rio. Reply urgent.

Monty."

5.

Cable, March 29, 1961, from BELL to RIMM:

[Note that this cable and the preceeding one were also sent

to the DDP as an info copy.] This cable recounts another

message apparently received from an agent within Cuba.

The

agent who sent this message had the cryptonym "WOTLOX." The

English translation of this cable reads as follows:

"Plan (4) 9 April. Fidel will talk at the

palace.

Assassination attempt at said place

followed by a general shutting off of main

electric plants in Havana Veladura. Occupy

the public square, telephone company, atares

6.

Cable, dated April 5, 1961, to BELL from RIMM.

This cable, an information copy of which was sent to the DDP,

transmitted a message received from an agent within Cuba,

whose cryptonym was

NOTLOX. The English

translation of

this

message is as follows:

"Your message 15.

Brand, Chacho, and Luis

only have arms

for 50 men. Blowing up (of)

central electric plant and possibly attempt

on Fidel will be decidedly carried out

9 April.

Once this

(is) achieved impossible

Your military aid is decisive.

If it does

not come that date we are lost."

7.

Cable, dated January 9, 1961, to JMBELL

from Guatemala.

This cable reads in part as follows:

"ESÖLEO-1

was advised below-listed names provided by Guat secret service

with statement they all Cubans except as noted who are on

or in Guat with mission assassination ESVEWICLE=1 and ESoirO-l:"

[There follows a list of eight names.]

This cable apparently

reflects information received by the CIA that certain people

in Guatemala were targets of Cuban assassination plots...I

would speculate that the two acronyms, ESOLEO=1 and ESVEHICLE-1,

refer to Cuban exile leaders who at that time were in training

in Guatemala for the Bay of Pigs mission.

8.

Cable, dated June 4, 1961, to BELL from RIMM,

into copy to DDP.

This message transmits a message received

From the agent NOTLOX from within Cuba. Its English trans-

lation reads as follows:

"Functionary Italian Embassy by the name

of Moratori says he works for one intelli-

gence organization of yours, he says he is

in contact with Martin Elena

and others

and that you have plans for invasion

within 30 days after killing Fidel, advise

if we can confide in Moratori."

This message would seem to indicate that an assassination plan

may have still been in existence in June of 1961, after the

failure at the Bay of Pigs and of the assassination attempt

discussed above.

Apparently the agent NOTLOX was not arrested

in April, since

he is still sending messages in June.

9. Cable, dated May 3, 1961, to BELL from JMRIMM.

This message transmits another one received from an agent

inside Cuba.

The cryptonym of this agent was TEKLOK. The

English translation of the message reads as follows:

"We are contacting all groups (dos) to

organize one united front with a coordina-

tor.

You name him or we elect him.

us. Will try kill Fidel today. Andres

OK

but still hiding. His men gone to hill.

Want know and what can be used. (as rcvd)

Luis Jorge."

Note that this is a second agent within Cuba to

transmit

message dealing explicitly with the subject of

assassination.

It should be noted that I did not search the files

of the DDO to locate these documents.

Rather they were

searched by DDO employees and these documents were compiled

by these employees and given to me through Joe Seltzer.

Nothing in this package of documents would allow me to deter-

mine the

true identities represented by the cryptonyms of the

addressors

and addressees of the above messages.

Nor is it

possible to identify the agents within Cuba identified by the

above cryptonyms.

When I returned these documents to Seltzer,

I requested that he determine the true identities of the

possessors of these cryptonyms and also seek to obtain copies

of any replies the CIA may have sent in response to these

messages coming out of Cuba relating to the assassination of

Fidel.
