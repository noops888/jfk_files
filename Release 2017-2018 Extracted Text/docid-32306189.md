Registration Act - Cuba."

Your attention is directed

Buiet dated July

20, 2961,

which indicated that the puryose

of this investigation was

to determine if the subject had

violated neutrality statutes under our jurisdiction and

the investigation was being conducted at the specific request

of the Department.

Rerep, therefore, incorrectly carries the

character of this case as

"Registration Act - Cuba" and should

be corrected to resd "Neutrality latters."

It is noted that the administrative pages

of this

report set forth various reasons why no additional investigation

is being conducted.

You have pointed out that the subject

is afforded continuous coverage by lll 639»S and in the opinion

of the reporting Agent additional investigation would only

result in inconsequential information.

You have also pointed

out that past experience has shown that subject has been

evasive

and a liar and since no information of value has been

obtained from hin in the past,

a current interview would

merely be a waste of time.

Sulet dated July 20, 1961,

specifically instructed your office that this investigation

was being conducted at the request of the Department and that

a thorough investigation should be conducted including a

complete and thorough interview of the subject as well as of

the members of subject's group. The opinions of the reporting

Agent are not sufficient ground to discontinue this investigation

and close this case.

The Department has requested the investi

gation and & thorough investigation must be conducted and a

report of that investigation subnitted for a prosecutive

opinion before the case can be closed.

Reference is made to Bureau letter to Miami dated

July 20, 1961, requesting that sufficient investigation

be conducted to determine whether or not subject's activities

are in violation of Section 960, Title 18, United States

Code.

In view of the results of the investigation set forth

in the details of this report reflecting continuous

coverage on this individual by MM 639-S, it is believed

that additional investigation in this matter would only

result in inconsequential information. Investigation has

on has

disclosed that subject is a braggart, liar, and this is

borne out by exaggerated statements made by him to

the press. He is nothing more than a publicity seeker

and it is not believed that he should be given

the dignity

of further investigation at this time. Mu

The Bureau has requested that subject be

interviewed concerning his recent activities.

Past

experience has shown that subject has been evasive, a liar

and will not give any information of value to the

interviewing Agents, and it is,

therefore, believed that

this would be nothing more than

a waste of time. Furthér-

more, since MM 639-S has stated that subject is not

recruiting at the present time, and that his organization,

the International Anti-Communist Brigade, actually is

only a "paper" organization and has no members other than

hold be we done in the that l vestigation

Miami continues to follow the subject's activities

through MM 639-S on a daily basis and it is believed

that this case should be closed at this time and only be

reopened at such time as established informants indicate

that subject does represent some major threat in the

anti-CASTRO field.

Herald' on July 3, 1961, reportedly contained

an article indicating that approximately 70 men

of Sturgis' organization were scheduled to make

parachute jumps but only two parachutes were

available.

In this article Sturgis (Fiorini)

claimed his organization has 5,000 men of which

700 are in training and that his organization

includes paratroop groups, underwater demolition

teans, and others in educational activities."

The Department concluded that in light of the

above described activities on the part of the subject,

as well as his past history of extensive revolutionary

activity, it was the opinion of the Internal Security

Division that there is sufficient indication of possible

violations of Title 18, United States Code, Section 960

to warrant investigation.

On July 18, 1961, MM I-I informed that JERRY

BUCHANAN, known to him as "BUCKY", had escaped arrest

by the Miami Police Department in connection with the

theft of the

tug boat "Gil Rokie" on February 4, 1961.

MM T-1 identified the photograph of BUCHANAN which had

appeared in the "No folk Led spatch-the Portamouth

, dated May 16, 1961.

MM T-1 advised that BUCHANAN was formerly

associated with a group of individuals who trained at

No Name Key, Florida, under the auspices of ROLANDO ARCADIO

MAS FERRER

ROJAS.

BUCHANAN lived for a period of time

at 1651 West
