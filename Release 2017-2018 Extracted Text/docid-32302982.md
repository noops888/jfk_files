The original complaint in this matter was that

the subject, while drinking, claimed to have plans to blow

up a Yugoslavian vessel.

MM 639-S, who knows the subjectand characterizes

heavy drinker, who while drinking comes out with

fantastic stories bordering on fantasy, stated that the

subject has not returned to Miami, and his present

whereabouts is unknown.

The Bureau will note that in 1960, the subject

received 100% disability from the Veterans

Administration

(VA) for schizophrenic reaction, competent paranoid type.

SCOTT E. TRIMMER, the original complainant in

this matter, stated the subject is a heavy drinker, who

contradicts

himself and claims to have been born in about

every major country in the world.

TRIMMER said he did

not give credence to what the subject said.

In view of the subject's unreliability, mental

arsability, and the fact that his present whereabouts is

unknown, no further inquiries willk conducted in this

matter,
