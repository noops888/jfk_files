"The Clique" and, therefore,

is unable to have any knowledge

of terms used after a person becomes a

member.

T-1 stated

that T-l knew that in order to be a member of

"The Clique"

you did have to have a godfather to sponsor you but T-1

has no knowledge of any other requirements or rituals per-

taining to the initiation.

T-1 added that

those connected

with this group

all grew up together in the same neighborhood,

attended school together, hung around together and so you

were always "on trial" and being watched in everything you

did or said..

(I-I stated that I-l was close to NICK CIVELLA

and only had to report to him and this was based on the

fact that T-l's father was a very close friend of "The

Men at the Bakery".) T-l stated that I-I has never heard

any of the members called "soldiers" nor has I-l heard

the term of "caporegime" or the term "buttom men" used.

I-i stated that several years ago I-l was

playing golt with NICK CIVELLA and a stranger joined in

the group. I-l stated that, this man was fater identifiedd

to I-l as

company o1 NICK CIVELLA, but again I-l was not introduced

to ACCARDO and he, ACCARDO, was identified (to T-las

T-l stated that several

months

after the Apalachin meeting(T-l was told that JOE FILARDO

and NICK CIVILLA had attended the Apalachin meeting•

T-1 said that "They" only told you what they wanted

to know and you never ask questions.

I-I stated that T-i has reviewed and heard _ ''

on television the accounts of the testimony given by

JOE VALACHI and I-I feels that, because CIVELLA and FILARDO

attended the Apalachin meeting there must be some connection

between "The Clique" and the Cosa Nostra as described by

VALACHI.. T-l stated that T-l has no evidence whatsoever

to prove that there is such a/connection, nor was T-l ever

given any information to indicate that members of both

organizations associated with each other except for the

visits of VITALE and ACCARDO.

T-I added there is no doubt

in I-l's mind that if the members of the Kansas City group

were called upon for assistance by members of the Cosa Nostra

such assistance and cooperation would be given.
