Bob:

Herewith are 15 copies

of

the two compelling FOIA requests

of the moment, Belin asking for

everything while Fensterwald has

been very specific.

Belin was

counsel to the Rockefeller Commiss

and has been of concern to the DCI

in our slowness to respond as an

Agency.

Bensterwald has both

entered an appeal on our failure

to respond within FOIA limits, and

has already gone to litigation..

The request of Mark Lane, a

copy of which I passed out to ally

seems moot at this point inasmuch

as he has not responded to our

requirement of a check for $608.00

search fee.

I have not been able

to get an answer from OGC as to

whether this is still an open case

However, if it is still open, the

work for Belin as applicable to

Lane.

There is, at least one request

*(Harold Weisberg, 75-4765) which

is in the form of documents sent

from National Archives for review

and now within the GI Staff for j

action - originally

now Ethel Mendosa,

understand.

Several of the remaining cases

have been completed, or at least

require no further search at this

time. Completion of the machine

run should make available what wil

be needed in the future for

handling those and other requests.

If questions arise, I can be

reached at home on 941-4614.
