as a co-opted worker of section Six Department,

criptonym "EMIL." On 4/25/60 DUDA was sentenced by the Polish

court to 2 years imprisonment for producing substandard cement

and was reportedly in prison from April until October 1960. Yet,

during this period he wrote a letter to Mrs. GARDNER STOWE,

that if he had not been cooperating with the Polish Intelligence

Service he would not have been permitted to send the letter.

Further, he applied for & received passports for himself & his

Re San Diego report of 11/13/62. -

The fact that Mrs. Gardner Stove, who assisted

subject to come to the U. So, has retained all of his

letters to her may be very helpful in this case. It could

probably be presuned that the subject's correspondence was

exanined at least on some occasions by the Polish Intelligence

Service (PIS). On 11/16/59 the subject mentioned in one of

his letters that it would be easy to get an entry permit

(into the U. S.) from Germany; his statements in this letter

may have indicated that he was considering an escape or

Illegal departure from Poland and may have alerted the

Pis to take action concerning him. On 4/25/60 he was

sentenced by the Polish Court to six months' Imprisorment

and two years' probation for producing substandard cement.

The investigation of the subject with respect to this

• charge undoubtedly covered several weeks preceding 4/25/60.

•It will be recalled that CSNY 3531-5 reported that subject

was recruited by the PIS about 3/20/60.

It appears quite

possible that between November, 1959, and March, 1960, the

PIS may have studied his case;

that the matter was brought

to a head when he received notice from the u.

S. Embassy

in

. Warsaw on 3/2/60 that favorable action was anticipated

on his U. S. visa application; that the PIS thereupon

RA ¿ WALTER BONRYK DUDA

instigated the charges concerning cement production in order

to put pressure upon him; that in March, 1960, subject may have

agreed to cooperate with the PIS and that in April, 1960, the

charges were disposed of by dropping the serious charges,

sentencing him to six months on a minor charge and giving him tro

years probation as a further hold over him.

This reconstruction

of what may have happened is, of course, merely tentative..

Subject was reportedly in prison from April until

October, 1960, and yet he wrote at least one letter to Mrs. Stowe

during this period.

If he was not cooperating with the IS,

it seems unlikely that he would have been permitted to send a

letter from prison to a person in the U. S. with whom he was

negotiating to get out of Poland.

On 10/22/61 subject stated the U. S. Embassy had asked

him to apply for Polish passports foz himself and his family

and on 11/13/61 he said their passports had been obtained.

Since

the normal waiting period for Polish passports is fuur months for

persons with clear resords, it appears that there mist have been

some intervention on his behalf in order for him to obtain these

passports so quickly.

The information developed thus far tends to indicate

that the subject is identical with the individual named by

CSNY 3581-S. The evidencing of anticommunist synpathies by the

subject since his arrival in the U.S. is merely what might be

expected of a recruited PIS agent.

This case may present,

therefore, an

excellent opportunity to penetrate Polish

intelligence.

Letter to Los Angeles

RE: • WALTER HENRYK DUDA

105-111366

ail

San Diego should endeavor to obtain copies of all

of subject's letters to Mirs. Stove In order that the exact

statements of the subject and the pertinent dates will be

available for preparation öf-the eventual interview with

him.

Some plausible reason for wanting this correspondence

can be given to Mrs. Stowe as for example that it may give

an interesting insight into conditions in Poland during this

period.

If he has been recruited, the subject is possibly

not yet operational but he may be communicating with his

principal in Poland through a mail drop in Poland.

los Angeles should immediately submit its recommendation

regarding mail cover on subject. When subject is interviewed,

he should be questioned about his relatives and friends and

what reports he has received from them concerning

developments in Poland since his departure. If he falls to

volunteer infornation concerning one of his correspondents,

It may be an indication that this is his mail drop.

It is noted that in a letter to Mrs. Stove on

9/25/58 the subject stated that he was not a member of the

• Polish Communist Party (PZPR), but acmitted membersbip in

October, 1960, when applying for a U. S. visa. When the

subject is interviewed the circumstances of his joining the

PzeR should be explored.

New York should promptly furnish results of its

further contact with CSNY 3531-S.

NOTE:

Subject was an engineer in a cement plant in Poland.

He immigrated into the U. S. in Dec., 1961, with his wife and

21-year old son. CSNY 3581-S (Chipmunk) advised that a man of

the same name who was an engineer in the cement industry had been

recruited by the

PIS as a coopted worker about 3/20/60.

Mrs. Stowe

of San Diego, Cal., began corresponding with subject in 1948 as

the result

of their mutual interest in the Theophysical Society

Scemen, sisten hit cane to the U.S. Subject is now employed

company in Los Angeles.

A review of instant file, including referenced com-

munication, reflects subject has communicated with two accommo-

dation addresses for PSS, namely STEFAN STEFANSKI and WALERY

CIESLINSKI. Subject has

admitted forwarding materials to these

two individuals and CSNY 3581- has identified them as real

persons whose function is to turn over letters mailed to them

by PSS sources and workers outside of Poland.

It also appears that DUDA may well receive a personal

contact in the near future.

Subject has stated he "may possibly

be contacted after two years."

CSNY 3581-S has stated this

probably means a personal contact.

Los Angeles deems the following desirable;

(1)

Ascertaining identity and addresses of persons

to whom subject is corresponding.

This would include ascer-

taining complete messages of pertinent communications to known

or

suspected accommodation addresses in Poland.

(2) Ascertaining text of communications and

identifying post cards subject may receive from accommodation

addresses in Poland or a third country.

(3) Ascertaining, by means of a plant and/or appropriate

surveillance, if subject actually receives a personal contact.

This means would also be utilized in the event it becomes

desirable, with prior Bureau authority, to develop an anonymous

source at

subject's residence.

TRANSLATION FROM GERBIAN

Handwritten Letter

N. I., April 17, 1961

Dear fella, dear Walter,

Late but nevertheless! That

am writing by

hand, is a great sacrifice.

above all, myself, Tony,

Vasco and Paul want to express hearty thanks for the

very big and irlendly reception (in a genuinely Slavic

fashion). I only hope that

I can reciprocate.

The 2 days in St. Louls were ice-cold and

unfriendly and on lionday, at 5 P.M., we flew back to

New York.

I spent the rest of my leave at the doctors,

for Vasco, because of his birthnark, had to undergo an

operation and. also Pauli with his phinosis. Now everything

is over. The rest:

bills.

Riverside and the nice innates (Hella and Walter)

will remain unforgettable to us.

in New York the weather

been beautiful only since yesterday. At my place of

work, things are as they were before; however, the newest

Is that on Honday the 13th, our beautiful leather bag

was stolen, with reading and sunglasses and beauty case.

I forgot it for a few minutes in

the ladies room... good-bye!!

(sic) The bag alone is worth 70.00 (sic).

The second iten:

different working hours.

I work from 9:30 to 6:36 and

am free on Thursdays and Saturdays.

Every day I intena to

quit, but i think of traveling and

seeing hurope. So

hold my tongue.

Here great preparations are being made for the

World Exposition and we shall be fully occupied.

The house matter is O.K. The possession was to

take place on May l, but the owners cannot move into the

new house as yet.

It is not ready. Thus the moving wild

not occur before

wune do

Personally, I am afraid of 1t;

again so much work and effort!
