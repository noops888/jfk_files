I. Background Information. (5)

Police (D.F.S.), requested the cooperation of the technical

devices which, according to information obtained by the

D.F.S., had been brought into the country and buried at

a spot near the Mante-C. Victoria road, between kilometers

Indicated spot, between kilometers 643 and 644, for the

purpose of determining the indicated zone where, according

to the information, was located the spot where the

explosives had been buried. (S)

At the end of four hours, we succeeded in

finding the exact spot where the

explosives had been

buried, in a promontory bordering the left side of the

road and approximately 15 meters from

the road, between

Kilometers 642 and 643.

The location is shown on

a) The Explosive Charge - Rectangular in

shape with

the following approximate dimensions: 30 x 20

x 7 centimeters.

The charge consists of a block of

explosive covered with a solia, putty-like plastic

material, the entire surface of which is covered witr

black insulation tape.

At one of its edges, 2 plugs

for an Iron pipe of 3/4 inch diameter were found.

These

are fastened separately by a screw to lengths of galvanized

Iron pipe of the same diameter and approximately 15

centimeters long.

The pipes are located inside the

explosive charge and serve as a lodging for the detonators.

Two metallic rods of 7 millimeters in diameter and 10

centimeters long extend along the longitudinal axis of

the charge.

They have screws at the ends which serve

to fasten them to the spools.(s)

The explosive inside is white in color and

plastic-like.

Its characteristics and potency are unknown.

It will be necessary to conduct analyses to determine

1ts class and type. (S)

It was ascertained that the explosive charge

was not assembled and ready for detonation, since it did

not contain the proper elements for raring exopagating

ind amplifying the detonation.

b)

Spools-magnets - There are four of them,

and they consist of

spools of approximately 3 x 2x1

inches,

containing at their ends two metallic plates

fastened by bolts.

Each of these plates has a bore hole

Into which the small rods used to hold the charge are

placed.

On the side opposite that containing the bore

hole,

there is a metallic plate whose function is to

serve as the surface which is connected by the magnet

to any metallic surface. Photograph No. 11(5)

Detonators - The detonators are of the

percussion type and apparently are activated by an

electric current.

The Explosive Charge - Rectangular in

The charge consists of a block of

explosive covered with a solid, putty-like plastic

material, the entire surface of which is covered with

black insulation tape..

At one of its edges, 2 plugs

for an iron pipe of 3/4 irch diameter were found.
