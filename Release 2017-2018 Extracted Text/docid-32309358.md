The "AMIGO'

VASQUEZ of Progresso,

Yucatan, was hired by the five United States citizens, with

CAMPOS and MAGANA as crew, for a five-day fishing and sightseeing

trip from Progresso to Isles Mujeres, Yucatan, at a cost of

3,000 pesos.

Having obtained port clearance, the party left

Progresso on the 'AMIGO' at about 2200 hrs. on Friday, 18th

October. About 2330 hrs. three of the Americans threatened the

Mexican

crew with pistols, and forced them to take the

inshore opposite the abandoned hotel 'Tropical Reviera'.

further men, with a considerable quantity of equipment were then

ferried on board by the boat's dinghy. This operation was

completed about 0300 hrs. on Saturday, 19th October.

The 'AMIGO'

was then sailed eastwards along the northern coast of Yucatan,

both the Mexican crewmen having been tied up, but released one

at a time to steer the boat.

They passed Isles Mujeres about

1400 hrs. on 20th October and turned south. About this time,

according to CAMPOs, he learned that their destination was Belize.

end of Turneffe was sighted at about 1830 hrs. on Monday, 21st

October. CAMPOS was told to steer to the east of Turneffe,

where they would meet another boat which the Americans would

board, leaving the 'AMIGO' and the two Mexican crew to return

About 2100 hrs. on 21st October the 'AMIGO' went Confidential

aground on a reef, remaining fast until 0600 hrs. on 22nd

October, when the crew and the Americans got it free.

They

remained at anchor for about 24 hours in the same area, but

saw nothing of another boat.

On the morning of 23rd October

CAMPOS pointed out that he only had fuel for about 5 hours

sailing, and was then told to make for Belize.

The eight

men,

who were not included on the Progresso Port clearance

certificate, were landed at Shag Caye Bogue, about 12 miles

south east of Belize City, with the major part of the equip-

ment, by means of the dinghy, which they kept with them.

The

'AMIGO' then came into Belize City harbour.

The following morning a Police/Military party, guided

by CAMPOS, went to Shag Caye Bogue and collected the eight men

and their

equipment without resistance. All were brought into

Belize City, and all were charged under the Immigration

Ordinance, the Mexican and United
