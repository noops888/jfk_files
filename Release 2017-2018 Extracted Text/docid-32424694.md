Annex 5

OBAT WEATSPIERE SUBVERSIDN

We are concerned about Cuba's effectiveness as a base for

subversion in the hemisphere. We are giving the highest

priority to this problem and can report progress in countering

Cuba's subversive efforts.

While we can never insure that

will not be able to help subvert another Latin American

country, effective action on our part can considerably reduce .

Cuba's capability to do so.

Krulak Sub-Committee: Following the February 25 sub-

mission of a report on subversion by an interdepartmental

working group headed by Ambassador Thurston, the Coordinator

of Cuban Affairs on February 27 appointed a

Sub-committee

1) control of movement of persons to Cuba for subversive

training; 2)

control of movement of propaganda material;

3) control of movement of arms; 4) establishment of a surveil-

lance system in the Caribbean; 5) exchange of intelligence

information and, 6) control of movement of funds for subversive

purposes.

Another paper, on training of Latin Americans, is

under preprration.

Central America - Managua Team: These papers were used

in preparing talking points for the Meeting of Presidents at

San Jose where it was decided to hold the Managua Meeting of

Ministers of Government, Interior or security, to discuss

measures to counter Castro-Communist subversion in the

especially vulnerable Isthmian area.

In preparing for this

latter meeting the Krulak papers were again drawn upon

heavily. At Managua the Ministers agree to recommend to their

governments that they undertake the following steps designed

to limit Cuba's

potential for subversion in the Central

American area:

A. Adopt, within the limitation of their respective con-

stitutional provisions, measures to be put into effect

immediately to prohibit, restrict and discourage the

movement of their nationals to and from Cuba.

To

measures, they propose the adoption of the following

1)

Provide, as a general rule,

that every

passport or other travel document which may be

issued carry a stamp which indicates that said

passport is not valid for travel to Cuba.

2) Declare officially that nationals who are

permitted to travel

to Cuba should have the per-

mission duly inscribed in their official travel

document.

3) Promulgate regulations restricting the

granting of visas to foreigners who have travelled

to Cuba within a

stipulated period of time.

4) Notify travel agencies and transport com-

panies of these measures for due compliance; and

inform the government of other countries through

the most appropriate means.

5) Request the Governments of the Hemisphere:

a) not to allow the nationals of signatory

countries to travel to Cuba unless they possess a

valid passport or other document issued by their

country of origin valid for such travel;

b) not to accept visas, tourist cards or

other documents issued to their

to Cuba

which do not form an integral (non-detachable)

part of their passports or other travel documents;

c) to observe the limitations placed in

the passports or other travel documents of the

nationals of signatory governments and not allow

them to depart for Cuba;

d) to inform the signatory countries

through appropriate channels of refusals to allow

one of their nationals to depart for Cuba; and

e) to provide the signatory governments

the names of their nationals which may appear on

the passenger list of any airplane or ship going

to or coming from Cuba.

B. Enlist the cooperation of financial institutions to

report on the transfer of funds which persons or r 3i

groups catalogued as Communist subversive elements

make, within their respective countries, for subversive

purposes; and to establish surveillance of Communist-

controlled businesses and other activities to identify

the transfer of funds through such establishments for

subversive purposes or activities; and impound such

-unds, or take preventive measures

compatible with

ach country's legislation, so that they may not be

used for purposes

that would tend to destroy demo-

cratic governments.

C. Take action to impede the clandestine movement of

arms into the Isthmian countries, including specific

instructions to border control forces to intensify

port, airfield and border inspection of incoming and

outgoing cargo in order to prevent contraband traffic

in arms; and establish strict security and accountability

with respect to arms and ammunition issued to their

armed forces and law enforcement agencies.

D. Take action to prevent the introduction of subversive

Communist propaganda materials into the Isthmian

countries from abroad

that may be instigated by Castro-communist propaganda

or agents in each of the Central American countries

Bilateral Approaches: Mexico is now the only western

Mexico also is requiring that

measures•

Following our approaches on this matter, other countries

have also shown an increased awareness of the need to take

counter-subversion measures.

Prime Minister Bustamante of

Jamaica told Assistant Secretary Martin he had no intention

of permitting travel to Cuba and that he had turned down

requests from both KIM airlines and the Cuban Government to

on brave to

resume flights between Cuba and Jamaica.

The Bolivian

Government has also indicated it is finally becoming con-

cerned about the large number of its citizens who are

traveling to Cuba and is willing to take steps to reduce

this travel.

Some success has also been

achieved in undercutting

specific Cuban propaganda efforts in the hemisphere.

Partially

because of our efforts to make it difficult for Latin Americans

to attend the recent "Solidarity with Cuba" meeting in Brazil,

this event was far from successful.

ECONOMIC RESTRICTIONS

a) Shipping

The results of our demarches to cut down Free World

shipping to Cuba are best explained by figures. During the

i 2962d by

period January 1 to March 31, 1962 a total of 337 Free World

vessels entered Cuban ports.

During the same period in 1963,

only 62 Free World vessels entered Cuban ports. A proposal is.

presently before the President to expand NSAM No. 220 to bar

U. S.-financed cargoes to all vessels owned or controlled by

persons owning or controlling vessels engaged in the Cuban

trade.

Such a measure will affect several hundred vessels and

we anticipate it will result in a further decline in Free

World shipping to Cuba.

Other measures being considered include closing OAS

ports to all vessels engaged in the Cuban trade on continuous

voyage, requesting U. S.-owned oil companies to voluntarily

deny bunkers in the Western Hemisphere to ships known to be

engaged in the Cuban trade, reassessment of the definitions

within the terms of Section 107 (B) of the Foreign Aid and

Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1963 and closing

United States

ports completely to certain classes of vessels.

b) Civil Aviation

Betore the missile crisis, five international airlines

served Cuba with about 20 frequencies weekly. Through our

efforts, all Free World international airlines except IBERIA

• (Spain) have ceased operations to the island. IBERIA has

one-to-two flights per month.

CUBANA (Cuba) has a bi-weekly service to Mexico City.

The Mexicans have taken several measures to tighten the controls

on this service.

These are the only scheduled links Cuba now has with

the Free World.

Continued efforts by CSA (Czechoslovakia) and CUBANA

to obtain servicing and/or passenger rights in other Free

World cities have been thus far successfully blocked by

Departmental efforts.

Any requests for transit, servicing or passenger

privileges by CUBANA, CSA or AEROFLOT at any point are

strenuously opposed on a continuing basis.

c) Trade

The decline in Free World trade with Cuba has

materially affected her ability to maintain the former

relatively high standard of living enjoyed before the

Castro take-over.

The 4th quarter 1959 GNP of $2.391 billion

pesos has declined an estimated 25% to about $1.790 billion

pesos (Est. 1962) while the population has increased roughly

0% from 6, 661,000 to 7,068,000 in 1962. From these data it

appears that the per capita GNP has declined from about

360 pesos in 1959 to 253 pesos per annum in 1962. This

decrease in income and the rise in prices caused by the

increasing shortage of consumer goods has further reduced

the average Cuban standard of living, causing widespread

discontent. Some selected trade figures may be illustrative

of the effects of the United States efforts.

Strategic Commodities

We are continually endeavoring to halt the flow

of strategic commodities which formerly were supnlied to

a great extent by the United States to Cuba. We have recently

through the combined efforts of State, Commerce and

private industry successfully blocked the exportation of 500

small tractors from Britain to Spain to Cuba and the sale

of 2.5 million tons of Egyptian oil.

Additionally, several shipments of bright stock

(oil additive) have been denied Cuba. In several instances

export sales of Cuban sugar were blocked.

Efforts to further disrupt Cuba's economy through

cutting off needed imports and prevent the earning of badly

needed foreign exchange by reducing sales of sugar, tobacco,

molasses and other products are being carried forward on a

continuing basis.

EXILE PROBLEMS

1.

The Cuban Revolutionary Council and Dr. Miro Cardona

The Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), headed by Di. Miro

Cardona, has, since March 1961, covertly received about

$3,000,000 from the United States. The Council is composed

of about a dozen exile groups which represent the main anti-

Castro non-Batista political stream in the exile community.

It should be noted that at last count there were estimated

to be over 400 exile groups,

the great majority of which

are splintered groups consisting of a

"leader" and a few

of his friends. The United States has regarded the CRC

as its main point of contact with the exile community.

The

CRC and a few important exile groups outside the CRC (also

financially assisted by us) have engaged in propaganda and

other activities with our support.

We have refused Miro's demands that we form an alliance

with him for the purpose of military action against Cuba, and

he has resigned. His resignation will probably be accompanied

by that of most of the Council members and the Council may

well disappear. We currently think the Council's disappearance

would be a desirable development.

recommendations regarding our future relations with the

exile groups. Attached is a copy of the Department's

press statement regarding Dr. Miro's resignation.

2. Alpha 66 and Similar Pin-Pricked Raids

There is attached a copy of the joint State-Justice press

release on this subject.

We are currently considering what if any fruitful

anti-Castro activities such groups may be persuaded to

undertake.

3. The Cuban Brigade

We have established a program of military and civilian

opportunities for the members of the Bay of Pigs invasion

brigade. Some 400 members of the Brigade have enlisted in the ATTACHES

military program (22 week training, or officer training, or an

eight week training course for those over 35). The civilian

aspect of the program is, after several obstacles have been

overcome, now getting underway. This portion of the program

offers qualified Brigade members loans for full academic

expenses at the university level, a vocational training

program including English, and special employment counseling.

The monthly compensation for Brigade members is scheduled to

terminate with a check for the month of May.

4. Resettlement of Cuban Exiles

We have pursued a policy of voluntary resettlement of

Cuban exiles out of the Miami area. To date somewhat over

50,000 refugees have been resettled through the HEW-Voluntary

Agency Program. An estimated 125,000 refugees remain in the

Miami area. Even before the current Miro resignation, tensions

between the local Miami population and the Cuban exiles had

arisen.

Congressional representatives from Florida expressed

concern that further influx of refugees to Miami could result

in unpleasant incidents:

At the present time refugees inflow

has been reduced to a trickle due to the absence of transportation

between Cuba and United States.

HEW is redoubling its efforts

to persuade refugees to leave the Miami area. After the Miro

Cardona affair dies down, many Cuban refugees may be more

favorably disposed toward the resettlement program.

U. S. MILITARY TRAINING FOR CUBANS

On April 17, 1963, there were 2343 Cuban volunteers parti-

cipating in a 22-week enlisted training program at Fort Jackson,

South Carolina. The first training company (composed of 207 en-

listed men) completed training on April 10. These men are now

being returned to civilian status. On April 26, two additional

companies will complete training. Thereafter approximately 200

men will complete their training and return to civilian life each

week. It is estimated that approximately 10 or 15 enlisted men

from each of the 12 companies will volunteer and qualify for two

years service in the U. S. Army. By mid-July 1963, less than

100 enlisted men will be participating in the 22-week program.

Prior to the initiation of the training program for members

of the 2506th Cuban Brigade, five Cuban officer volunteers were

placed in training programs. Three of this group are in training

at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and two are in training at

Fort Benning, Georgia.

A special program for former members of the 2506th Cuban

Brigade was initiated in March 1963. Eighty-nine enlisted men (age

18-34) and 93 enlisted men (age 35-50) are now in training at Fort

Jackson, South Carolina. The older age groups will complete an

eight week training program in early June 1963; the younger age

group will complete a 22-week program in early September 1963.

An officer training program of 15 weeks duration for former

members of the 2506th Cuban Brigade is underway at Fort Benning,

Georgia. There are 209 officers in this program (Army, 145; Navy,

24; Marine Corps, 16; Air Force, 24).

Enlisted Brigade members in the 18-34 age group and Brigade

members in the officer program may volunteer for advanced training

in a wide variety of specialities.
