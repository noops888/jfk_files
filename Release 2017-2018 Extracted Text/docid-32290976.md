Illona Marita Lorenz olaimed Fidel Castro

by castro's henchmen and, thereafter, she fled Cuba, '":

and returned to her home

in New York City Mer

mother wrote many government leaders throughdut tne

world soliciting action against Fidel Castro and an

article concerning the aifair appeared in a "scandal-

type" magazine.

Miss Lorenz claims Pelletier come to

New York City,

trying to marry her and also trying

to take her back to luba.. She refused to have any

the to do with neute cal be sente an asked

her to accompany him to Mexico.

On this occasion,

subject accused her of causing him to lose favor with

Castro and said Castro had forced subject to divorce

his wife in cuba and ordered him to marry wiss Lorenz.

New York Office, when told by Miss Lorenz that subject

attacked her unen she declined to accompany him to

Mexico, instructed her to report this to New York City

Police

Department (NYC PD), which she did.

NYC PD

had subject report to police station where he

identified himself as a military dide to Castro and

eunibited his diplomatic passport.

Miss Lorenz failed

to press charges against subject and the charges were

dismissed as NYC PD was reluctant to act against subject

in disfavor with. Castro and possibility exists ne

might defect while he is in Mexico.
