TP. 92-1

Will note that from investigation thus far conducted

by the Miami Office relative to Cafe D'Artist, 732 Biscayne

Boulevard, Miami,

that operators of such establishment

were possibly former contacts of the subject in Havana.

They undoubtedly have contact with JUDITH SALVAT and information

furnished by NY 3368-C-TE on 4/2/62 to SA WARREN J. DONOVAN:

concerning subject owning Club Artist may possibly be true.

Miami will, therefore, consider timely interview

of officers of such Cafe D'Artist in an effort to trace any

of subject's funds.

The Miami Office will conduct appropriate investigation

relative to information furnished by NY 3368-C-TE on 4/2/62

that subject source believed TRAFFICANTE operates Local 136

and uses one (FNU) GONZALES, a high class individual, to

operate this local, noting Miami, in weekly airtel summary

dated 5/18/62, ascertained it Is identical with Local 135

walters, Waitresses and Bartenders Union, AF of L, 821

AT MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA

Will report appropriate investigation of 9570

Will maintain contact with informants and

confidential sources to report activities of the subject.

Will continue to explore employment of highly

confidential Bureau techniques on subject's close

associates

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Bureau letter to Tampa dated 4/26/62 pointed out

that even though the subject maintained an apartment and

spends a great deal of time at Miami, Florida, office of

origin should not be changed in this investigation at this

time.

The Bureau noted it was felt that the subject continues

to exercise substantial control of hoodlum activites in the

Tampa area and is his original base of operation. The

Bureau noted Tampa should continue its efforts to penetrate

the TRAFFICANTE operations and that every effort should be

made to establish highly confidential sources relative to

subject's operations so as to be in a position to accurately

report all his present operations and interests.

The Bureau accepted reports should be submitted

at intervals no longer than 30 days and that Miami and Tampa

should submit weekly airtel summaries rather than daily

teletypes and rather than 15-day reports. The Bureau further

noted that these instructions should in no way be construed

as a lessening of investigative endeavors.

On 4/16/62, MIKE LISMAN, Corporal, New York State

Troopers, Liberty, New York, confidentially advised SA

JOHN A. AKERN that JERRY GREITZER, presently incarcerated at

Sing Sing Prison, Ossining, New York, had information on

SANTO TRAFFICANTE and had given a statement to the New York

State Police concerning bim. LISMAN requested the New York

State Police not be identified as the original source of this

information as it would point to him, and under his regulations,

he is required to forward his information up the chain of

command, and the decision of whether or not to disseminate

1s made at the top.

this was not possible.
