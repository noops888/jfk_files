ReBulet 1/2/64 and New Orleans letter 3/13/64

The lamps previously altered by the FBI Laboratory

containing radio microphone have been tested in the room

normally occupied by MARCELLO at. the Town House Motel,

Lafayette, La., and they appear to work satisfactorily in that

transmissions

are clearly received in the adjacent room.

An actual installation has not been effected on

MARCELLO to date in view of the fact that he has been known

to be in Lafayette on two occasions since the equipment has

been checked.

On one occasion he stayed at the Holiday Inn

Motel and on the second occasion he stayed at the Town House

Motel, however, his reservations were made in another person's

name.

In view of the fact that MARCELLO will occasionally

utilize the Holiday Inn Motel when he goes to Lafayette, UACB

a survey will be conducted to determine the feasibility of

an installation in the Holiday Inn Motel.
