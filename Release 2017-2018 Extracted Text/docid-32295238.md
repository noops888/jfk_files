MM 45-1156

MEC: ggE

By communication dated May 21, 1968, the Mobile Office

advised that It. Commander D. F. SMITH,

U. S. Coast Guard, Mobile,

Alabama, advised that the "Granwood" had arrived at Mobile,

Alabama, and

was placed in drydock on May 20, 1968. At that

time an

examination of the vessel indicated that an explosion

had occurred outside the ship through a grate through which

water was being pumped to cool the engines.

The force of the

explosion raised the deck of the engine room approximately four

inches.

The U. S. Coast Guard report prepared at Mobile, Ala-

bama, indicates

that an examination of the "Granwood" shows that

the hole in the hull

of this vessel occurred between frames 31

and 32 from alt, just under the water tank top, and the plates

of the hull were

curled back into the ship by an explosive force.

By communication dated June 19, 1968, the Mobile Office

advised that the British freighter "Granwood" had departed from

Mobile, Alabama, under tow for repairs which were to be undertaken

at a British shipyard.
