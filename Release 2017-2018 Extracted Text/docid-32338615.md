HUA HEARINGS

MIAMI,

FLORIDA

Rebulet

TohN HowArd LAWSoN

Miami dated 10/15/54 and WFO Tet to

Bureau dated 2/14/55.

Parts I

and II of the HUA publication entitled

"Investigation of Communist Activities in the State of Florida"

have been reviewed and pertinent information relating to Com-

munist activities of individuals residing within the Miami

Division has been disseminated to their files and will be

reported in their yearly reports.

This review failed to uncover any new information

concerning the greater part of the persons identified as being

Communist Party members in the Miami Division.

Fifteen witnesses appeared before the HUA of which

seven were "friendly witnesses" and eight were "unfriendly

witnesses". The seven "friendly witnesses" identified some

131 individuals as Communists of whom some 71 resided in the

Miami Division, and some 25 in the Charlotte Division. Five

of the "friendly witnesses". have testified previously as

government witnesses and all have been interviewed by the

FBI. Three of these witnesses were former security informants,

two have furnished information concerning Communist Party

activities in the Miami area and the remaining two

were recent-

ly interviewed by agents of the Miami Division at which

time

they agreed to cooperate fully with the government.

Six of the eight

unfriendly witnesses" are

Security Index subjects in the Miami Division and the other

two are Communist Index subjects.

During the HUA Hearings,

no disclosures wer

made of any Communist activities in Florida later than 1949.

The investigation failed to uncover any Communist Party activ-

ities during the past five years in Florida.
