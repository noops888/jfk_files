Title: ASSASSINATION MATERIAL DISCLOSURE ACT

Synopsis: JFK Task Force returning file(s) to Miami.

Details: Enclosed for Miami are the following file(s) :

MM 92-139-Sub II Serials 1 thru 60

MM. 92-139-Sub I Serials 183 thru 960

The originals removed from these files

and replaced

with duplicate copies of the original were accessioned to the

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to

Provision of the JFK Act

allowed for certain information to be postponed from public

release until the year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOT

necessarily been released for public review in their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed

assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of

whether the material is open in full or released with information

postponed. Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files

accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer

considered the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have

been inserted strictly for research

purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned

file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date

classification.
