contacts with COHN and telt that they needed somebody to regularly

go to Chicago. JACK'MC CARTHY"s unable to regularly go to

Chicago, so WENGER was the logical one.

He said he offered this

contract to WENGER because he wanted to find out from WENGER

who the other people are who are feeding information. He told

WENGER that he trusts him but he wants the information from

EMANUEL to come back to him since he has to feed it to certain

sources.

WENGER told the source he would be glad to do it.

He told source "you don't know how crazy this whole

thing 1s. You don't know who Dorfman's contact is. This guy

is the judge. The one before the Grand Jury who subpoenaed

Clinton down. He hates Clinton and since he subpoenaed Clinton

down, he has met Alan Dorfman in a hotel room when Dorfman gave

him a room number. It was the same time Jimmy (HOFFA) was in

Chicago. It's all very recent. Jimmy came down from his room

(at the same hotel) and met with the judge.

The judge said

(Source advised that this is the same judge the recently

ordered STANFORDYCLINTON, 'attorney for the Teamsters, to testify

before the Grand Jury, claiming that this was a fiduciary relation-

ship rather than a lawyer-client relationship. Source stated

that there was some publicity concernig this matter in the Chicago

ppers, but WENGER told him that CLINTON's testimony was unimportant

since the same testimony had previously been given to the Grand

Jury by WENGER and MURTHA.)

WENGER said that the only reason the judge forced

CLINTON to testify is because there is a long-standing

antagonism existing between CLINTON and the judge, but WENGER

also said that the judge told HOFFA that as far as JIMMY, HOFFA

was concerned he would do what he can. He thinks this is just a

shame what they are doing to him (HOFFA) • The judge apparently

told HOFFA they are pushing him (the judge) and the government

is being ridiculous.

He also allegedly told HOFFA they are

really on a fishing expedition and wasting the Grand Jury's time.

Source further advised that the meeting between the

Federal judge and HOFFA, according to WENGER, took place the

last time that HOFFA was in Chicago. WENGER also told the source

that last week ALAN DORFMAN was extremely,

worried.

He told WENGER

that he probably should not have arranged the meeting, but he

wanted JIMMY (HOFFA) to hear for himself what was being said

because he (DORFMAN) did not know whether HOFFA would believe him.

WENGER said that DORFMAN told him he has known this guy

(the judge) a long time and has "played with him"'. WENGER then

told the source that there is some area, either in Palm Beach or

Key West, Floida, where there is $100,000 involved and they

are presently questioning someone before the Grand Jury fin

Chicago) about it.

WENGER said they are all upset because

the allegation concerning the $100,000 is true and ALAN DORFMAN

had previously told the judge "Your honor, there's nothing in

there, everything is clean"

• WENGER told the source that DORMAN

and coted tattee ave tot him to tee pie conta a (the judge)

In an attempt to identify this judge, source asked

WENGER which judge and WENGER replied, "the one who is having

trouble with Clinton. He purposely did it to Clinton because

he hates Clinton anyway"

WENGER indicated that DORFMAN must now go back and tell

the judge the truth concerning the $100,000 item, which is

currently being questioned by the Federal Grand Jury in Chicago.

Source advised WENGER's conversation with DORFMAN

was probably on Monday, 4/15/63.

WENGER told him that DORFMAN

drove him to Milwaukee where WENGER is handling his business

with the Restaurant Employees Union there.

WENGER, according

to the source, represents this union. Source advised that the

Federal judge who is close to DORFMAN is the same one who

recently received publicity in Chicago when he ordered STANFORD

CLINTON to testify. Source advised that STANFORD CLINTON is the

attorney who represented ACCARDO in the appeal that ACCARDO won.

Source could supply no further information at this time

concerning this possible leak to the Teamsters in Chicago.

WENGER also advised the source that his nephew,

HAROLD SILVERBERG, went to Philadelphia to assist a union and

source determined that this was not a Teamsters union but that

an official of this union had two of his relatives, possibly

his mother and sister, on the payroll andthat an inquiry was

being made by law enforcement officials. WENGER stated that

this union official has "kited things and gotten back $100,000'

Source speculated that this was Hotel and Restaurant. Workers

Union in Philadelphia.lf Source advised it would probably be

Fairly easy to determine the identity of this union since

SILVERBERG must check in with his office (WENGER's office) twice

a day while on the road.

to Philadelphia this week.

Re:

JACK MC CARTHY

Source advised that he met JACK MC CARTHY on 4/17/63.

MC CARTHY told him that he has a meeting at 1 p.m. on 4/18/63

to settle all his problems. Source advised that MC. CARTHY did not

tell him where the meeting would be held or who would attend.

Source told MC CARTHY that he never dreamed that the "Federal

boys" would play like this and MC CARTHY replied "no, its the

state"

MC CARTHY said that initial contact has been made with

state authorities to settle his problems and he has been told

that he will need approximately $50,000 to make a payoff to

settle the case.

MC CARTHY told the source that he hopes they

are leveling with him because if he pays the $50,000 and still!

gets into trouble, he will kill somebody.

would report on his income tax return the $14,000 that he got

by check; a $9,000 and a $5,000 check from ANGELO SeRIE

The source told JIMMY HOFFA that ANGELO DI SPIRITO had gotten

$15,000 on the MINTZER loan (La Guaia Motel loan) • DI SPIRITO

allegedly gave this money to his father and received a savings

account check for most of the money to pay DANNY MAHER by check.

The source stated that he called ANGELO DI SPIRITO and told him

that he was going to report the males that he gave him on his

income tax return.

He stated he had no alternative and was not

going to take a chance because he did not trust MINTZER...

The'

source stated that he was reporting all the "green" that he had

given to DI SPIRITO, even though it did not pertain to the MINTZER

deal. The source stated that he thought it was only $17,500, but

that he only reported $17, 500.

Re:

DAVID WENGER

The source stated that DAVID WENGER has asked for

more "green"'.

However, JACK MC CARTHY does not want the

source

to give DAVE WENGER any more money until he finishes up the

Fairlawn Memorial Hospital and the bowling alley on 108th Street.

MC CARTHY said to hold back on him a little bit or he will not

have not completed the

Forum Motor Lodge deal and WENGER has held this one up himself.

PETE DE FEO said, however, to offer him some money to keep him

interested. The source said that he did, however, WENGER said

he would let the source know what he wants. PETE

DE FEO said that

he would deduct the points that were allegedly going, to wiNGeR tor

is holding out on HOFFA. The reasoning behind this is that he

does not believe WENGER would lie to PETE DE FEO. The purpose

of this is that they will be able to embarrass WENGER and apparently

show that he has been holding out, if not all at least in part,

from JIMMY HOFFA. The Forum Motor

Lodge Pension loan may be

approved by a phone conterence rather

Than waiting for the June

meeting.

MC GUIRE and GRAZIANO. SALLY BURNS wants the source to draw up

a proposition for this sports camp to submit it for a mortgage

loan. The source advised BURNS to get him the necessary

information, such as where the thing would be located and what

type of buildings, etc., would be constructed, so that he can

submit the necessary information for consideration.

SALLY BURNS also requested that the source look into

Il the Marlboro House project in Miami, Florida and see what he can

do to assist BURNS in this matter.

himself out of this directly, sent HERB COHN, to Florida to meet

MILTON SHEEN. (ph). In an effort to clarify this situation, the

Savings and Loan Company and according to SALLY BURNS, paid six

points discount; two by check and four by "green" to Washington

federal to get & $1.300,000 WorSe BURNS Ash

the money through a person by the name of SIDNEYXMOSS

subject who has since allegedly skipped to England.

BURNS related

to the source that a LARRYXHOLLANDER Find whom SALLY BURNS allegedly l

protected, is the one presently operating the Marlboro House project.

were talking to in Florida on behalf of the source.

SALLY BURNS related to the source that he has a friend

buying a motel in Coco Beach, Florida near Cape Canaveral and that

he wants the source, at a later date, to go down and set up the

purchase of this motel because he, BURNS, is going to have a "piece"

of the motel. The source does not know, at this time, the name of

this motel.
