Memorandum 1/19/65 from Mr. Baumgardner to Mr. Sullivan

discussed draft agreement being negotiated between the Secret Service

and the FBI.

A question had been raised by Mr. Robert Carswell,

Chairman of the President's Committee on the Warren Report, as to

why there was nothing in the draft agreement to the effect that the

FBI, in order not to jeopardize sensitive subversive investigations,

did not disseminate to the Secret Service the names of a select

group of highly sensitive cases. The Bureau did not want anything

in the agreement relative to exceptions which were within the

responsibilities of the FBI nor any secret agreement indicating

there was exception to the agreement. Carswell's query related

to a group of 16 individuals identified through aur penetration of

Soviet-bloc intelligence on whom we are workinghlooking toward

doubling them prosecuting them, ongfurther penetrating.: block

intelligence.

The memorandum pointed out that, while it was not thought

desirable

from a security standpoint for the names to go over to

Secret Service, it was still less desirable to have any fuzziness

in the agreement with Secret Service which could be utilized

at

to indicate the Bureau did not meet its

responsibilities. The proposed action was that, if the Director

agreed, we would furnish the names to Secret Service under the

appropriate classification.

Mr. Tolson noted, "I thought all names were sent to

Secret Service weeks ago."

The virector

know we had not done so."

As of 11/64 the Bureau had

some 18,500 names. Included in this dissemination were 16 names of

highly sensitive cases which had been submitted solely because they

were included in the Espionage Special Section of the Security Index.

Memorandum to Mr. Wa Co Sullivan

RE:

PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE ON THE WARREN REPORT.

62-109717

SCORET

two of these cases involve rugoslav agents whose identities

were supplied bykour Yugoslav defector-in-places

agents who were identified bylour Czech defector-In-place GIMME S-

who is now being operated by Central Intelligence Agencyt (CIA) in

Czechoslovakiag

Six are agents of the Soviet Committee for State

Security (KGB) Identified through FEDORA, a Soviet defector-1n-

place.

Four are agents of Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU)

identified through TOPHAT, another Soviet defector-in-place.-

One

is a Castro-Cuban intelligence agent who represents an important

penetration of Cubantalandestine communications kw

In no instances have the original sources indicated that

any of these espionage agents have ever had an assignment or training

in assassination or terrorist activity. These people are collectors

and transmitters of information.

Memorandum Mr. W. A. Branigan to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

11/12/64 (memorandum attached) recommended that these cases be

removed from the Espionage Special Section of the Security Index,

that the Liaison Section retrieve from Secret Service all documents

concerning the Bureau regarding these cases, that the appropriate

field offices be informed that this has been done with the caveat,

a that should any of these subjects become involved in a plot a

against the President oF for other reasons disassociated with our

live defectors-in-place,Warrant reinstatement on the Security Index,

the field should again recommend such subjectfor inclusion on

Security Index and prepare appropriate material for dissemination

to Secret Service.

The Director noted, "Just what would be my explanation

if one of these 16 should attempt to kill the President and we

had not furnished background to Secret Service?"

Mr o

Wo

11/16/64 (memorandum

attached) pointed out that, bearing in mind that these 16 individuals

have not threatened the President and are not the type to engage

in such activity, we would be in the same position as we are in

with reference to thousands of other individuals on whom we have

investigative coverage or information who are not on the security

Index and whose statements and activities do not bring them within

the criteria for dissemination to Secret Service The Director

noted, "I concur most reluctantly."
