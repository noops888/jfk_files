Upon the receipt of Bureau cable of January 14, 1961,

not only the German Police but also the Austrian Federal Police

Police by teletype on January 25, 1961 of the Subjects departure

the Subject actually entered Austria, this case is not being retained

in a pending status in order to obtain a check of records in Austrian

cities where the Subject may have stopped. However, in the event the

Austrian Police do obtain and furnish any information on the Subject,

it, of course, will be reported.
