12 March 1954

MEMORANDUM FOR: CHIEF OF SECURITY QU

SUBJECT:

Mrs. David Morales

1, Mrs. Morales called the office at 1130 on the above date to

inquire if any mail had been received fron her husband and to advise

that $67.50 had been deposited to her account so she would not be able

to repay the $400 advance at this time. I advised her that there was

not any mail and that the $400 had already been deducted from her

deposit, thus the low sum of $67.50.

2. She then asked if she could have Bill's number as she had

mislaid 1to

As I was looking it up a very definite click was heard

over the telephone as if someone had lifted the extension phone. I

asked her if there was anyone at her house to which she replied no.

I then checked the extension on my phone but there was no one on that

When I returned to my phone I asked Mrs. Morales if she was on

a party line to which she replied that she was not but there was still

someone on the line so perhaps I should call back later. I told her I

would.

Since I will not be in the office this afternoon to receive

instructions from you, I will call her from an outside phone and tell

her not to call the office again unless she receives further instructions

to the contrary.

I will advise her of Rip's number but tell her not

to give her last name when making a call.
