SECOND WORKING DRAFT

CUBA

MOVEMENT OF PROPAGANDA MATERIALS

I.

Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede

the movement of Communist propaganda materials from Cuba

to and within Latin American countries. Actions contemplated

to control the movement of propaganda are closely related to,

and in many cases identical with, those which control the

movement of persons and arms. As noted in the earlier paper

which addressed the problem of movement of subversive trainees

to and from Cuba, the successful execution of all the pro-

posals expressed below will materially reduce the flow of

propaganda materials but will not eliminate 1t entirely.

Communist Cuba has many legitimate outlets through

which propaganda materials flow. As these legitimate out-

lets are blocked by the initial steps herein proposed, it

will be necessary for the Cuban propagandists and their sympa-

thizers elsewhere to turn from the mass exportation of

materials, and to rely more heavily upon production and

dissemination of the same materials in a clandestine environ-

ment within each Latin American country. Of the two threats,

the illicit production of propaganda materials in each

country will be by far the more difficult to abate.

II.

Nature and Scope of the Problem

While the Castro image has faded somewhat in Latin

America, by virtue of his own imprudent actions, the

susceptibility of the Latin American people to communist

propaganda remains high. The basic social and economic

factors which have made this true in the past have not

greatly altered, and the variety and quantity of propaganda

materials with which the Latin Americans are now beset are

impressive, as exemplified in the one hundred million dollars

which the communists are estimated to be investing in the

project annually. It is a large program and it presents a

continuing threat to the tranquility of Latin America.

For the purpose of this paper, propaganda materials

include radio program scripts, tapes and recordings, printed

materials, (posters, pamphlets, magazines, leaflets, books,

newspapers, news service output), motion pictures, duplicating

or reproducing equipment, electronic communications equipment,

and printing resources, particularly paper stockpiles. To

be complete, moreover, "movement of propaganda materials"

must extend to small quantities of selected publications

which are hand-carried into a country by legal or illegal

travellers for subsequent reproduction. It must also include

materials transmitted through Cuban and Soviet Bloc diplomatic

channels, shipments via postal channels, quantities intro-

duced through smuggling operations, oral transmission of

propaganda guidelines by indiviaual travellers or by Radio

Havana, and the dissemination of slanted news by Prensa Latina,

the official Cuban news agency, for pick-up and reproduction

by local outlets.

Finally to be considered are thematic

guidance which can be reproduced and exploited locally by

returning trainees, front groups and sympathetic publi-

cations and, in some countries such as Mexico, Argentina

and Uruguay, the products of those commercial establishments

which regularly print or broadcast pro-Castro materials

as a matter of policy or ideological conviction.

Press and Publications

There are 326 Communist and pro-Communist newspapers

and periodicals in Latin America. Beyond this, infiltration

of:

the democratic press, coupled with the non-critical

attitudes of some newspapermen gives wider diffusion to the

Cuban propaganda line. In addition, there are 228 communist

oriented publishing houses and bookstores in Latin America,

serving as outlets not only for 30 different Cuban period-

Icals, but for a large variety of other Communist printed

material. Every Latin American country except the Dominican

Republic, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and Venezuela permits these

bookshops to operate. Many of them offer publications at

very low prices or even give away two or three books with

the purchase of one, and easy credit terms are available.

Excluding TASS and New China News Agency (NCNA),

Prensa Latina is the principal Communist news agency in

Latin America. It operates openly, but not entirely without

restriction, in ten countries -- Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,

Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Panama and

Uruguay. Although its users are chiefly leftists or overt

Communists, in some countries there is fairly extensive un-

attributed use of Prensa Latina releases, especially in

radio•

All of this is essentially overt. However, decrees

banning Communist activity and propaganda have not prevented

the clandestine publication and distribution of a number of

periodicals, books and other printed materials in some

countries, notably Argentina, and propaganda materials

continue to seek undetected entry through the mails. In

Panama, for example, postal and customs authorities destroy

an average of 12 tons of Cuban propaganda per month. Another

ten tons, from the unknown quantity which enters Costa Rica

each month, is identified in the post office or the airport

and destroyed.

Radio

Short wave radio is the principal direct mass audience

medium used by Cuba to carry subversive propaganda to Latin

America. The Castro regime has constantly increased Radio

## Page 9

SECRET

Havana's short wave broadcasts to Latin America to a

current level of 115:30 hours per week.

Cultural Activities

Penetration under the guise of "cultural" activities

is a favored Communist propaganda technique in Latin America.

There are 64 Cuban binational centers and Friendship Societies

in the area.

Films

Feature films and short documentaries produced by the

Cuban Institute of Motion Picture Art and Industry (ICAIC)

play a direct propaganda role.

These films are shown primarily

in binational centers, pro-Communist labor and student groups,

and in private or clandestine meetings.

It will be seen from this brief review that Latin

America is the target of a broad scale propaganda program,

comprising not only propaganda materials but including also

the ideas, the knowledge and the resources which are necessary

to make those materials effective.

III, Direct Actions to Impede Legal Movement of Propaganda

Materials.

Presented below is a summary of actions contemplated

to impede the legal movement of propaganda materials from

Cuba to and within Latin American countries. For the purpose

of this paper, legal movement is defined as movement by

recognized private and governmental carriers and communications,

as well as postal systems and diplomatic pouching.

These actions offer promise of achieving early and

effective results in some Latin American countries. They do

not have universal application and that those which are

feasible in one country may not be so in another.

1. Political Actions

a. Induce newspapers in countries in which

Prensa Latina operates to cancel their subscriptions

to the service, on the basis of its subversive

character.

b. Fersuade those governments which receive

Cuban and Bloc diplomatic missions to maintain close

surveillance over the propaganda activities of the

Communist embassies with a view toward prohibiting

abuses of diplomatic privilege for subversive purposes.

c. As applicable and feasible, induce Latin

American countries to:

(1) Adopt adequate internal security legis-

lation which would provide severe penalties for

any person engaging in dissemination of Cuban

Communist propaganda which inspires terrorism

or proposes the overthrow of the legal govern-

ments by force and violence.

(2) Preclude attendance of Cuban delegates

at international meetings held in Latin America.

(Delegates are propaganda disseminators.)

2. Intelligence Adtions

a. Continue U.S. Intelligence efforts in each

country to identify individuals, organizations and

facilities involved in propaganda importation, repro-

duction and/or dissemination; make available to each

country selected intelligence concerning these individ-

uals, organizations and their activities.

b. Encourage each country in which the Communist

Party is illegal to offer rewards for information lead-

ing to interception of Castro Communist propaganda

and conviction of persons supplying or disseminating

materials considered dangerous to the country's tran-

quility.

c. In separate diplomatic approaches to each

country, urge full and effective cooperation with the

appropriate organs of the OAS, and bilaterally among

the several nations, in the interchange of information

concerning novement of propaganda materials.

d. Persuade Latin American countries to report

promptly to the diplomatic mission of the country

concerned, the identity of any national of that

country who arrives from Cuba and who is discovered

to have been carrying Communist propaganda materials.

3. Covert Actions

a. Cause disruption in the reproduction and

distribution of propaganda materials, and in the

procurement and delivery of related supplies

and

equipment.

1. Dissuade U.S. and local business firms from

advertising in Latin American media which carry

pro-Communist materials; prepare and circulate to

U.S. firms, for information, lists of such media in

order to encourage their support of a non-Communist

press.

g. Inhibit the spread of Cuban and Bloc binational

centers and Friendship Societies in Latin America by

an active program to expose their subversive activities

and objectives.

h. Provide selective financial support to non-Communist

newspapers or press services in order to make them

economically competitive with Communist-aligned publi-

cations.

4. Military Asiatance Action

Obtain and make available, through U.S. Military

Groups, U.S. materials on the realities of Communist

propaganda, suitable for use in Latin American troop

education programs:

IV. Direct Actions to Impede Illegal Movement of Propaganda

Material.

As the actions outlined in the preceding sections

become effective, movement of propaganda materials will be

forced into clandestine channels. Although many of the

actions outlined in Section III will serve to restrict illegal

movement, additional measures to impede this clandestine

traffic will acquire increasing importance.

1. Intelligence Actions

a. Use penetration and other intelligence techniques

to identify efforts to move propaganda materials from

Cuba to and/or within Latin American countries; determine

routes and methods employed; report selected information,

consistent with requirements for protecting our own

intelligence program, to governments concerned.

b. Ütilize the U.S. Intelligende community to

determine the nature and extent of clandestine air-

craft and small boat traffic between Cuba and other

countries in the Caribbean and Central American area,

with special attention to Mexico, Honduras, Jamaica,

Haiti and Dominican Republic. Use the evidence obtained

to induce governments concerned to initiate surveillance

and other control measures aimed at interception of

propaganda materials.

2. Surveillance and Reporting Action

Exploit the mechanism of the Caribbean surveillance

system approved by the President in the study on move-

ment of personnel, for discovering and impeding the

movement of propaganda materials by illicit means.

3. Political Action

Where legally feasible to do so, induce each Latin

American country to improve police procedures to seek

and destroy the subversive Communist propaganda apparatus

in that country, and to detect and eliminate corrupt

officials who permit illicit shipment of propaganda

materials.

4. Techincal Assistance Action

a. Frovide technical assistance to enable local

officials to locate clandestine transmitters.

b. Assist Latin American governments, which so

desire, to develop a jamming capability against

Communist radio broadcasts.

American internal security forces, especially patrol

and intelligence activities aimed at preventing

clandestine propaganda activities.

Provide equipment,

training and

advice as required.
