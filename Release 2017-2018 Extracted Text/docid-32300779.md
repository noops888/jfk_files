The NYO feels that separate investigations on

the subject and his wife result in duplication, and that

this investigation could be handled more efficiently by

having one pending investigation on

the subject's wife.

All information concerning the subject will be

channeled to the subject's case

file in the NYO, and all

significant information pertaining solely to the subject

will be furnished to the Bureau.

The agents who observed the subject and his wife at

the

office

of the

"China Daily News", on 7/9/67, were RICHARD

MO CORMICK, JR. and PETER E. WEBB.
