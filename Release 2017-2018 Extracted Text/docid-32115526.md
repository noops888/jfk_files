He will probably emerge from the New York thing as a

full time organiser lin gone spectal fleld suchas youth. felu)

At the start of the Meeting Genne brought out

her brief case full of clippings: (Newspaper) etc

she

also had a lot of penciled notes which she was

undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing

amd to give ochars hell for not co-operating with her. (LU)

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around

ahe Late Pres. Kennedy. (e) (U)

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a

Communist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

against the C. party of America but by the time the

reactionaries were getting started It was announced

that it had been disclosed that it seemed 11ke the

extreme

sight had been active. This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not

the

C.

party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the

extreme

right of almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober

the masses that it was the same callber of people who.

had Insulted Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas,

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this

Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he

told them he gets lots of letters of

enquiry about the

C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds

Of others and even sent him literature if he requested

it. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with a

statement. but he stated to them he would have to dig the

letter out and be sure before he Made any statement.

Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when he got back to

New York to look in the files if he had a letter fron

situation very good

when he stated that the fact that the Murder of Bill

Moore, M Edgar Evers and others In the souch going

by without punishment had set the stage for the

Assassination of Pres. Kemedy. Everyone readily

agreed. (4) (4)

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist
