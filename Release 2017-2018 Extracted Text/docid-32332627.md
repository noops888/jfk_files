PHILADELPHIA

At Harrisburg, Pa.

The Intelligence Unit of the Internal Revenue Ser-

vice at Pittsburgh, Pa., is conducting an intensive investi-

gation relating to expenditures made by LA ROCCA during the

years 1961-1962, and desires to learn of any motor vehicle

purchases made by LA ROCCA during these years. It has been

noted that most of the cars driven by LA ROCCA are registered

under the

name of his wife, MARY S. LA ROCCA, or the North

Star Cement Block Company at Pittsburgh, Pa.

A Thunderbird

driven by his adopted son may be registered in the name JOHN

S. LA ROCCA.

Philadelphia at Harrisburg 1s requested to advise

whether a search under the name of the subject and all known

aliases, as well as for his adopted son, his wife and.

.._ the

North Star Cement Block Company for 1961-1962, would be.

feasible so that the Intelligence Unit of the

Internal Revenue

Service may be advised. It should be noted that prosecution

against LA ROCCA is being sought for the early portion of

the year, 1964.

At Wayne, Pa.

Will ascertain the subscriber to telephone Mu 8-

6600, which was contacted from the LA ROCCA residence at Ingo-

Pa., on 5/12/63.

If this number belongs to a motel,

will determine whether LA ROCCA or his adopted son made re-

servations during the appropriate period.
