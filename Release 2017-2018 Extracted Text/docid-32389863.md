SUBJECT

Allegations of Lee Harvey OSWALD's

connection with the Agency

REFERE

Memorandum of Conversation, Dan

-Rather/Les Midgley and the

Dated 6 September 1975

DCI,

EKL

FIRS

The referent memorandum contains two points

which require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

of President Kennedy and that have crept up every so often

since then.

in one torm or

anotker, the allegations are

that Lee Harvey OSWALD had been connected with the Agency.

The allegations are totalfy

unfounded.

2. The facts regarding

the matter are as follows:

• Mr. R.G. Roccan

on 27 November, 1963 I was instructed Dy

immedjate superior at that time, to

make a thorough check thin the Agency at Headquarters

to determine whether tee Harvey OSWALD had ever been

used by the Agencylor been connected with it in any

conceivable way.

He ordered me to make the checks

directly and personally to the degree possible and not

to accept statements of intermediaries.

He also ex-

plained that he was following instructions from Mr. R.

Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the Warren

Commission.

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond

that which I had already obtained before (plus those

Items which had been integrated into the records systen

since the assassination).

There was nothing in the DDO

records which indicated any Agency connection with

OSWALD.

Of OSPAYD

Kad been requested by

the foreign divisions

of their

propriate

stations, I was told, and the

results were negative.

I recall very clearly that we were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American returning

Irom the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by

DCD, thus having established contact with the Agency.

The same point has now, quite understandably. been made

by the two CBS newsmen.

Having some knowledge of this

subject I have personally concluded that there is valid

reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.

He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD

had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before

1957/1958.

Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,

particularly by Americans, before that time was quite

uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in

those days.

The thaw began in about 1956 and by

of that decade there were so many persons travelling

and from the Soviet Union that DCD

was incapable of

ing to all of them.

Therefore, a program of selectivity

specific,target applicability was

light of the above, it

seems to me that OSWALD-- if he

came to Deb'slattention at all--would have easily been

by-passed because he simply did not possess the type of

information

that ped was seeking at that time.

DCD would

sure by have

used its limited manpower on travellers who

had

greater access in the USSR.

should be added that my above-described

search in the Agency file holding produced no record or

indication that any other US Government agency had used

him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was

giving you full support.. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various.

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City-

We have now found that the photograph that was ta sen was not

that of Oswald.

We do find from our informant don there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it waid take three

weeks.

He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the

story and we have

those operational sources down there.

"We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

who is handling it for the Departmen:-

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report

and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Rocca

"Internal Mama Reyanding Aganey's Position in Dealing

with Warren: Commission

L The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the Director has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM

Thursday.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

The DDP wishes to have from you a

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews. I raised with MI. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WIlsource. I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of net factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have fitst had rome preliminary reaction o made stre that the

Director is fatty aware of its implications since it contd well serve

ao the basid log detailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

now this carefully and made a decision as

restion of timing.

Given the schedule, you will app

late that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: Lee Harvey OSWALD

On 17 December Mr. Papich

ROHIBITED

anticipating a request from the Comnission, named by President

Johnson to look into this case, for copies of Bureau materials

supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with theySylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that'

some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico.

Mr. Papich

Inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some

other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of

the Agency to make

available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the fBI - sensitive information which could relate to

telephone taps.

MI. Papich again raised the question on 19 december and after

consultation with Mr. Angleton and Mr.

Mr. Papich that when the Bureau is lac

It was agreed with

problems of this

nature in meeting the needs of the

the Bureau should

not pass to the Commission infor

Agency, but should

refer the Commission to the Am

onal information.

It was mentioned to Mr. Pa

ed to meet the needs

of the Commission in ano

more complete report or

We then dis-

Oswald was in Mexico City, using as a key the fact that

Oswald's attempt to obtain a visa vas probably communicated to

This seems so because:

a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the

Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or

Wednesday.

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban

Consulate at least once on Friday and at least

occurred after the first visit, see the second police inter-

the argument with Azque took place was itself different from

and earlier than the visit to the Cuban Consulate during which

SIlvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get

a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip

of paper with her name and telephone number; because Azque

telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,

Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make

the following recommendations concerning the further handling

and possible disposition of QJWIN:

I believe the original purpose for which

b.

QOWIN,

APROHIRITED

competent, usable

agent who is capable of operating in certain

circles

in Europe where we have very few assets.

Whether this

is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends

on the determination of how he can be used either by

che German Station. or

the Austrian station or by

any other KUBARK if an as a long tern unotficial

cover agent.

He is not being used at the present time.

He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any

operational assignments are concerned.

It is recommended that the present Chief of

Station Luxembourg and RABNEY

be consulted by

Headquarters for their best recommendations as to

the continued use. of QJWIN.

After these recommendations

are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian

stations be consulted for their possible interest in

using him.

If after these discussions a sensible

framework

for the operational use of QJWIN can be

established, I would recommend we continue him.

If

not, I would recommend that he be

terminated at the

time his present contract expires.

As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation

which have been covered under the QJWIN authorization for

security reasons and with which Fletcher M. KNIGHT is fully

familiar as I orally advised you on 26 June 1963,

SUARET: Mr. Lee HaREPRODUCTION

25 November 1963

1. It makes little Hithe

Halter P. HALTIDDlHI RILEDWOOD had at one time an

OI interest in Oswald.

As soon as I had heard Oswald's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed - sonetime in Summer 1960

with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the layng

on of interview(s) through KUJÜMP or other suitable channels.

At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his fanily

were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck

ne from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

particularly interested

particularly interested in the of oswald meht provide on the desere

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers.

3. I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at

the time.

Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's artival.

I do not know what action developed thereafter.

4. As an afterthought, I recall

also that at the time I was becoming

increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered

in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "hone".

The AEOCEAN. 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases.

We established links between

some of these women and the KGB.

KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across.

It was partly out of curiosity to lcamn if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany hin to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that

we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

Timited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission.

It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E. l Dissemination to the Intelligence Community

E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4 Memoranda to Warren Commission

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file.

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form (SCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all CSCI's.
