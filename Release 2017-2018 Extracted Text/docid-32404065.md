SUBJECT:

Release of Bay of Pigs Records

As we discussed, CIA plans to begin releasing to the

National Archives declassified records related to the Bay of

Pigs covert action. This is part of the Agency's Historical

Review Program, which focuses on declassifying records of

historical value.

Attached for the ARRB's information is a brief

description of the records that we expect to release first,

probably within the next few weeks.

We expect to make a

public announcement once the date for transfer of the

records to NARA is firm.

Release of CIA Records

Pertaining

to the Bay of Pigs Covert Action

The Center for the Study of Intelligence is releasing

to the National Archives approximately 5,000 pages of

declassified CIA records regarding the covert action

culminating in the paramilitary invasion of Cuba in April

the Bay of Pigs.

The Center anticipates releasing

records after completion of

declassification

additional

reviews.

The documents contained in the initial release include

the Agency's "official history" of the Bay of Pigs by Jack

B. Pfeiffer, accompanied by the author's research notes.

second paper consists of an after-action assessment prepared

shortly after the Bay of Pigs landing by the official

primarily responsible for preparing the plans for the

paramilitary action. Finally, the Center is releasing the

report of CIA's Inspector General, issued in November 1961

and the response of the Directorate of Plans in January

1962.

Together, these records provide a general overview of

developments leading up to the policy decision to initiate a

covert action directed at the Castro regime in Cuba, the

evolution of CIA plans to carry out the decision, and

internal post-mortems into the failed invasion at the Bay of

Pigs.
