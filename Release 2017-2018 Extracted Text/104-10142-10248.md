7. (Secret - PG) LIAISON Michael J. Horsaman. Deputy Staff

Director, Subcommittee on International Organizations, House International

Relations Committee, Beverley Lumpkin and William Garvelink, of the

Subcommittee staff, visited C&RS Conference Room this date in order to

review files. While they were here, Miss Lumpkin and Mr. Garvelink

signed Nondisclosure Agreements and the matter of our dealings with NSA

was discussed with Mir. Hershman. (See Memorandum for the Record.)

8. (Unclassified - RJK) LIAISON Called Clare Buchanan, Senate

Foreign Relations Committee staff, and informed her that DOD could update

the background investigations of Seth Tillman and John Ritch, of the Committee

staff, if the Chairman sends a letter making such a request to DOD. She

indicated that she would move on this immediately.

9. (Internal Use Only - DIC) LIAISON I met briefly with Representative

Louis Stokes (D., Ohio), Chairman, House Select Gommittee on Assassinations,.

and then Mr. G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the

Committee, on security matters and a Nondisclosure Agreement. (See

Memorandum for the Record.) In addition, Chairman Stokes gave me a

letter which was addressed to the DCI and concerned the termination of

clearance status of two House Select Committee on Assassinations staffers.

10. (Unclassified - RSG) LIAISON Returned a telephone call from

the office of the Resident Commissioner Baltasar Corrada (D., Peurto Rico).

The Commissioner's press secretary,, Bernardo Guerra, indicated that he

was gathering general information on many agencies of the Executive Branch

and wished to visit the CIA with other members of the staff to "talk about the

CIA." I responded that I thought the best way to start was to send him a general

kit of public information on the Agency, which hopefully would satisfy his

informational needs. A kit was provided by A/DCI/PA and forwarded to

the. Office of the Resident Commissioner, Puerto Rico, Attention: Bernardo

Guerra, Room 1319 Longworth House Office Building.
