As background, the Central Intelligence Agency has

gone to great lengths to protect sensitive missions and prevent.

identification of covert personnel as Agency employees.

The

latter is especially profound as the very lives of these

The anonymity provided by cover is essential to their protection.

Furthermore,

Kermit Hall: Dean of Humanities, Ohio State

William Joyçe; Assoc. Librarian, Princeton U.

a) We are discussing our concerns with JFK Board Staff, and will ask the Board to

reconsider its decision.

b) We'll propose that a senior Agency officer brief the Board on the sensitivity of

3. Who would make the appeal to the President ?

Thus far, the process calls for the Agency's General Counsul to forward the appeal

to the White House Counsel, with the approval of the EXDIR and/or DCI.

4. Has there been an appeal to the President before?

CIA has submitted one appeal, in early 1996. The issues concerned identification of

certaini European stations and liaison relationships. The White House directed the

Board and the Agency to "work it out", which was done. After the ADDO briefed the

Given the

In sum, the conduct of covert communications and

there are some very specific damage issues that I wish to

highlight and they include:

Serious and Immediate Impairment to Physical and

Personnel Security:

Our

allows us to maintain a relatively low profile in the

place employees, facilities, and daily aperations at

greater risk.

In sum, _would become an easy "target

of opportunity" for the redia, foreign counter-

intelligence agents, terrorist and militia activities,

demonstrators, and emoticnally unstable individuals.

In the

For example,

• (S) The current Kasi prosécution provides ample evidence of the risks

posed by the public identification of CIA domestic facilities. Any individual

intent upon seeking retribution for perceived wrongs quite naturally seeks a

target providing the largest possible public notice and while CIA headquarters

is an excellent target, a covert facility is even a better target, and a

covert facility supporting the foreign espionage activities of the CIA is the

best possible target for a political and public statement.

(S)

The breach of compound security was by an out-of-state vehicle which

followed an employee through a remote gate and the driver had no credible...

explanation for their actions; the incident is considered suspicious and

unexplained.

The suspect package incidents include a box which was placed

(not dropped) next to our

facility which we believe was intended to test and

thus observe our response to suspicious packages.

10 per month and include only those vehicles which ignore clear signs that

they are entering a classified government facility but proceed in any event to

cooperating foreign nationals. To identify a communicator is one of the

highest priorities since it provides a possible entrée to cryptographic
