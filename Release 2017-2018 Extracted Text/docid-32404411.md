CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS

RELEASE IN FULL

2000

14 September 1992

NOTE TO CHIEF/HRG: FYI

Actual Pages Reviewed (and Released or Denied) in Boxes 1-6 of the Oswald 201 File

The total pages we reviewed in HRG in these six boxes were:

Of these, the total pages released to NARA were:

and the total denied were:

12,077.

11,583,

494.

This means that 95.9 percent of the total pages were released.

(This percentage is measured against the total number of pages, including more than a

half which were originated by other agencies or the press. Virtually all of the denied pages in

this case come from CIA documents. For future reference, when we have boxes that are made

up almost entirely up of CIA-originated documents, you might want to note that the 494 pages

denied in these boxes amount to 11.6 percent of the total CIA pages or, conversely, that we

are running at the rate of 88.4 percent release.)
