Operational As noted in the previous Request for Project Renewel,

tho formor LIMITED property was cold to Lecusus, wo as per forcal aree

sent with the Station, desollshed the old ctructure and cons;ructed & now

edifice.

While it was tritially corte plated to place the LETTED

(ITE:"its -band?) porconnel in the ned building and to retain the cano,

equal division of workload between LILYUC and LITTED, it was later

aculued to nove the present LILYLIC basenouse personnel (LICTIYa-13, -14,

-26 and -27) Into the new baso instead, alons with the following ancillary

modificationo s

An Increase in the hours of both the photo raphic and phyoical surveillerce

coveraze.provided con the new bine by the LILYRIC operators (0000-1600

hours) durine the weekdays and to here the LinITED bace provide

photographic and physical curveillance coverage fron 1600-1930 hours

oi Weekdays and from 00201300 hours Or weekends, These changes were

dictated by the fóllowing considerations:

1.

The new LnUShk building offers a nuch bettes vantage point

for both photographic and phycical surveillance than doos the

present comples nich houses the LILyIC and LINITED hases.

Thererore,

tho Station felt that the personnel occupying this

new base should be those porseseins the highest technlei skill:

and also those able to provide tre sost thorough and complete

coveraJee

since the united bere now has only one traired

operator wille the LILYNIC bacchouse has three, the LILyuc grou

and

a revision or workins hours was indicated.

Because it was apparent that the coverase of the LIzucK

Inctallation would de a lon race and continuing requiresent,

the station desired to stali the row base viti perconnel of loni

rene potential, LInpry-o, sou alrost to yeers old, does not

possess this potenticl; horever, the LILle agent coalet

3. Fliallo, the cocial end pirancial status of the illinic

persornel 1s such gore compatible eid consistent. with the e

vironent of the new building the is that of the LnITED lacily.

Attached herewith Is a sterilized copy of the Memorandum

of Agreement executed with LIMOUSINE on 3 February 190% Both

Three

signed and dated coples are retalned In Statlon files.

LIMOUSINE and his wife appeared and sighed the agreement, with

Robert L. EASBY acting for. ODYOKE. It will be noted that the final

torms were somewhat more favorable than

Headquarters had authorized.

Station had ample opportunity

the plans and they

begin almost at

Consideration had been given In the Station to installing

line-feed switchable transmitters In the two lower apartments in

vlew of their

probable etcract/veness to FUSTEAL personnel. However,

it Is Station's vlew that given LIMOUSINE's close

KUBARK on a number

of matters le would be well nelther to have too

nuch FJSTEAL Interest aroused in the bullding nor to give them the

opportunity to observe the sattern of LIFEUD/6 at such close range.

With reference to paragraph.5 of the memorandum, Station will

probably decide to have LIFEUD/6 draw up a normal contract with

LIMOUSINE and pay him his rent, which will be

passed by LIMOUSINE to

Station at reguler Intervals®

The question of how to route an

apparently normal transaction around LIMOUSINE's bookkeeper has not

yet been resolved.

AXDS RENOTRE

BUBICT Sole of LuTED Property to LINOUBINE

In 1955 KUnAR purchased the LDiD property (215 no metros of Land

and house) la Merco City for $12, 000 and then spent $3,500 for repairo and

renovations to secormodate KUBARS operational requiremento.

Because Of Ita Ides? Joention directly across the street fron the

UBSR Sobassy, thia property which was for sale was purchased so KUBARK could

establish control over this specific plece of property at that time., For

restone of security, legal title for LAMITED wasveated in agent LACUSING

who acted as tho cut-out vehicle. A statemert of trust is on fide at thi

Station In which LIHOBINE acknoledges XUBARk's true ownership or the

property.

"LIAITND bad been unid oporationally uità outatanding. success and

presumbly ulthout compromise, and it le Wl's Intention to continue using

1t.

It recently developed that part of the kIllED home crumbles, and

• the house was found to be in a pinilar state of disrepait.

Repaira and

Inited remodelling, hovever costly, did not seem to be econonically

feasible, and in addition cortain other operational and aecurity considerationa

scened to dictate the need for a sey kind of structure a higher building so

our angle of survelilance could be improved, and the addition of a comercial

Interest on the ground level to provide a dally Plow of people (ouch as a

bank, retail store, etc.) frection of a comercial bullding is within the

zoning restrictions of the dietriet.

The cost for new construction of a suitable building has been

estimated upwarde. of $55,000. 'Although the property 10 located In a aLovly

deterlorating diatriet,

nonetheless the proposition in bankable. Hith land

Included (appraiced it: $14,500 to 115, 000), @ 10001 bank 10 W111ing to 1000

8oß of the new construction cost ue 855,000.

LIMOUSINE would not venture into such a construction progran on his

ovn account at this time. He yould, however,

follow through with 1t as an

accommodation to KUBARi 1l the teras vere equitable. Accordingly, he baa

Indicated be will be willing to put up 20% of the conatruction cust from bie

own funds, borrow the remaining 80%, and then offered to pay Kuruk

180,600 pedis or $14,448 (appraised value by bank) for the 215 sa satres of

land.

Nothing would be paid for the old building, alnce iittle, of anything,

could be realised fron the sale of the old building and the cost of ruzing it

would far erceed the sale of the salvage enterialo.

Since much of LTHOUSINk's cash funds would be tied up in financing

tbe new contriction, he effered to effect payment to KUlARK at the rate of

4,300 pesos or $344.00 per monts over a 31 year period with the first payment

comencing 3 years after coopletion of construction or July 1905. IDOLBINE

would execute a non-intérest and unsecured note for the land. do vould ensure

KUBARK tenancy retention rigato to rental of third floor apartment at the rate.

of $2,300 pesos per month with AlBARK reserving theright. to cancel any time.

The apertment vould be built o KUEARK'@ reoulmamenta.
