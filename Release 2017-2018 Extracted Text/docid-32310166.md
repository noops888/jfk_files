STASSWISE

Mr. Davidson, who represents various foreign governments

and officials and who frequently in the past has volunteered information to

Bureau, particularly data which might assist his own endeavors, telephoned

at 10:20 a.m. this morning (5/6/70) with regard to the matter set forth

below. By way of background, Davidson called Mr. Tolson's office 11/10/69

to advise he represents Foreign Minister Adam Malik of Indonesia and that

Malik desired to meet the Director. The Director's regrets were expressed

to Davidson since the Director's schedule did not permit this.

This morning Davidson said a responsible American told him one

Subandro, a minister in the present Government of Indonesia who in his

opinion is

a communist and who has been in jail, would be released in the

immediate future and would replace Adam Malik as Foreign Minister.

Davidson felt the life of Malik, who is now in Indonesia, might be in jeopardy.

He asked that Bureau evaluate this information and furnish it to appropriate

officials of our Government.

It was explained to Davidson that Bureau is not in a position to

evaluate this information and would in effect be merely acting as a transmission

belt for him. He acknowledged this to be the case and said he thought that this

was a function of FBI. It was carefully explained that this is not an FBI

function and that we do not evaluate intelligence data such as he was reporting.

He acknowledged it was "raw" intelligence and he could not vouch for its

authenticity.

REC- 106

It was suggested to Davidson that he might desire to furnish the

material to the Department of State directly. He commented he did not like

the people at State responsible for Southeast Asian affairs but would consider

doing this. He was advised we would do nothing more than make his call a

matter of record.
