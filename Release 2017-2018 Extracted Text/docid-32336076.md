IN THIS DOGUMENT. KP 11-14-47

ON 42-23 97JEK)

Enclosed for the Bureau are 12 copies of a LHM

setting forth a summary of pertinent information in

Miami files regarding CARBO.

It is not believed the information available

regarding CARBO justifies additional investigation

regarding him at this time. CARBO undoubtedly lost

his nerve after capture in

• the Cuban invasion and made

whatever statement he could to protect himself. He is not

presently active in Miami, but in the event pertinent

information is subsequently devebped regarding him, this

case will be reopened.

It is noted MM 492-S, who is well acquainted

with CARBO, has advised that based

on his knowledge of the

situation, he does not believe CARBO to be a communist

or sympathetic to the CASTRO regime.

This LHM is classified "Secret"', since

contains

MM T-1 is MM 492-S.
