NOTE FOR MR. VANCE

Attached is copy of Second Progress Report of the Sub-

committee on Cuban Subversion. The Services and ASD/ISA have

concurred in this report with a few minor nonsubstantive sugges.-

tions (these are noted in ink).

CIA and USIA have concurred. State, however, has objected

on the grounds that certain actions have been taken with respect to

the Alerting System without sufficient authority.

Another meeting of the Subcommittee has been scheduled for

Friday afternoon in order to resolve this difference. I plan to attend

and will report any substantive actions.

PROGRESS ACHIEVED DURING APRIL IN IMPEDING TRAVEL TO CUBA

1. The Department of State has:

a. Participated in the drafting of a resolution passed at

the 3-4 April Managua Meeting respecting discouragement of

travel of Latin Americans to Cuba for training in subversion.

The text of the resolution is appended hereto.

b. Headed an interdepartmental team currently visiting the

Isthmian capitals whith the objective of securing the fullest

and quickest implementation of all the recommendations agreed

on at Managua. Prior to the departure of the team, Department

of State posts were instructed to inform the host governments

of the trip and to encourage them to identify the kinds and

extent of technical assistance it would be most useful for the

United States to furnish.

c. Caused to be noted in U.S. passports since 1 April

that they are not valid for travel to Cuba.

d. Following an indication that the Bolivian Government

might be willing to increase efforts to impede travel of its

nationals to Cuba, instructed the U.S. Embassy to recommend

that the GOB:

1) Ban travel to Cuba by Bolivian nationals except

for official or special purposes approved by the GOB,

and establish legal penalties for violations;

2) Require Bolivian citizens to have a passport or

other GOB document to travel abroad;

3) Make such document invalid for travel to Cuba unless

specially endorsed;

4) Seek arrangements with third countries which are

Important transit points under which third countries will

assist the GOB in preventing unauthorized travel by Bolivians

and will help identify violators.

e)? Drawing on the recommendation in the paper on "The

Movement of Subversives and Subversive Trainees" and other

sources; instructed the non-isthmian posts to encourage host

governments to take additional counter-subversion steps.

Each instruction was tailored to the local situation in

the recipient country and included appropriate suggestions

as to strategy which might be used in securing implementation

of the desired actions.

P)e Requested posts In Latin America to encourage host

governments to take appropriate measures to discourage

participation of their nationals in Cuba's May Day cele-

bration and to prevent charter flights from their country

to Cuba for the celebration.

g) Through efforts with various Latin American and other

governments, discouraged participation in the Cuban solid-

arity Congress. U.s. efforts contributed to limiting the

success of the Congress from the Castro Communist point of

view.

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued the US sea and air surveillance of the

area surrounding Cuba unt1l 25 April 1963, at the same

rate and with the same emphasis

as existed prior to that

date. Since 25 April 1963 additional sea surveillance

has been realized between Cuba and Haiti, due to the

stationing of the Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron at

the entrance of the Gulf of Gonaives occasioned by the

deterioration of internal conditions within Haiti.

Reports of subversive movement, or suspected subversive

movement, obtained by US surveillance are available for

Immediate transmittal through the US military alerting

system.

b. Continued action, at high priority, on the install-

ation of military communications facilities in Latin America.

As of 1 April, a

commercial submarine cable from Florida

to Panama became operational. This cable gives reliable

voice and teletype communications to CINCARIB including

both classified teletype and voice.

Negotiations are

continuing in Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador for the

installation of military radio facilities.

Installation

of a multi-channel radio station has been completed in

Costa Rica. A similar facility in Nicaragua is scheduled

for completion by 1 July 1963.

c. Established an Intelligence Center at CARIBCOM Head-

quarters, in connection with the program of surface

surveillance of the Caribbean, for rapid processing and

dissemination to countries concerned, via the American

Ambassadors, of intelligence on the movement of subversives.

Study of the establishment of intelligence centers in the

Caribbean revealed that the Intelligence Center should be

established at Caribbean Command Headquarters and that a

center need not be established at Headquarters, Caribbean

Sea Frontier.

d. Established on 11 April a U.S, military alerting

system operated by CINCARIB and CINCLANT. Pursuant to the

request of the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on

Cuban Affairs the Department of Defense has suspended the use

of the Military Groups in the alerting system and is working

with CIA to reduce duplication of effort to a minimum.

e. Alerted U.S, forces, for the most part within the

Atlantic Command, to be prepared to provide U.S, assistance

in the final interception of shipping in territorial waters
