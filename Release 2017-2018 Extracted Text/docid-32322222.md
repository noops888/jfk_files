Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: Detroit is requested to forward the documents listed

below to the JFK Task Force as soon as possible due to an

extremely short deadline.

Details: Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

form. The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in

full. Therefore, the documents will not be returned to Detroit.

Since the originals will be sent to the NARA, copies of

the documents should be made for record purposes prior to

shipment to FBIHQ.

The documents should be received at FBIHQ no

later than C.O.B. 05/08/98.

Please ship the following documents to FBIHQ, JFK Task

Force, Attention Catherine L. Lamey, Room 11144.
