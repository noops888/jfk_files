decidedly believe the first assumption is correct.

The CIA directly participated in the destruction

of the Cubana aircraft in Barbados."

-The principal leaders of Cuban exile terrorist:

groups are closely linked throughthe CORU organi-

zation to CIA activities against Cuba.

In his speech, Castro did not make any specific alle-

gations concerning a USG relationship with Orlando Bosch,

or Luis. Posada (two Cuban exile activists who were arrested

by Venezuelan authorities in connection with the Cubana

crash). However, the link with Bosch is implied since he

is reported to be chief of CORU, the umbrella organization

of Cuban exile terrörists.

Orlando Bosch

a.. Involvement in Crash: As noted above; Bosch was

arrested in Venezuela for alleged involvement in the Cubana

crash. In late June, a CIA source reported that an exile

group headed by Bosch planned to bomb a Cubana flight between

Panama and Havana. An FBI spurce has alleged that one a:temp

was made but the bomb did not detonate.: A second try occurred

in Jamaica on July 9, but the bomb exploded before the suit-

case in which it was carried was put aboard the plane.

(s)

According to CIA sources)

Venezuelan President Carlos

Andres Perez is said to be sympathetic to Bosch and has

permitted him to travel freely in the country and solicit funds

with the understanding: that Venezuela would not be used as a.

base of operations or place of refuge. Bosch reportedly promised

not to engage in terrorist activity while in Venezuela and

received a token $500 contribution from Perez. Another CIA

source reported that after Bosch's arrival in Caracas in September,

he stated during a fund raising dinner that "Now that our

organization has come out of the Letelier job looking good, we

are going to try something else." A few days later, Posada

allegedly said, "We are going to hita Cuban airliner" and.

"Orlando (Bosch) has the details.".

b. Relationship with US. (CIA says there are no current

or recent agency contacts with Orlando Bosch

The US is

currently attempting to have Bosch deported from Venezuela

Frank Castro

a...

. Involvement in Crash: Venezuelan officials reportedly

believe that Castro, (head of the FLNC terrorist organization,

a component group in CORU) is deeply involved in the crash,

though we have no details of his supposed involvement.. Erank.

Castro was in Venezuela in late September 1976 and in mid-

October was back in Miami..

Frank Castro has admitted to FBI

agents that he met with Bosch in Caracas on September 26 or

27, but denies any personal knowledge of the bombing of the

Cubana plane.

Relationship with US; [CIA says there are no current

or recent agency contacts with Frank Castro

who is an

American citizen with permanent residence in Santo Domingo.

Orlando Garcia and Ricardo Morales Navarrete

a. Involvement in Crash: Orlando Garcia is President

Perez' security and intelligence advisor, and Morales is Garcia's

deputy; both are Cuban exiles who are now Venezuelan citizens.

[A CIA sourceclaims that Garcia was directed to protect and

assist Bosch during his stay in Venezuela. Another CIA source (s)

reported that Garcia and Posada met Bosch upon his arrival and

escorted him to his hotel.. Both Garcia and Morales reportedly

attended the fund-raising dinner during which Bosch allegedly

made the remark about the "Letelier job," and after the Cubana

led to the bombing of the plane.

September 17 states that "a confidential source abroad" claims

to have been told by Roberto Carballo (leader of the Association

of veterans of the Bay of Pigs, AVBC, one of the component mello
