MEMORANDUM FOR:

JFK Microfilm Collection

-.

1.

In discussions with Tom Burkhardt in P&PG he has

indicated that they could support our requirements to

convert 72 reels of microfilm to hard copy for redaction.

While last year the estimate for the entire job was $16,000,

he thought to be safe we should

allow $25,000 today. If we

wanted two copies of each image, which would save each

reviewer the time to make a working copy, we should be

prepared to double the above price. These estimates assume

we need to copy all reels of film.

However,

we may not need

to copy the Oswald 201 material (14 reels) if we can assure

ourselves it is a duplicate of material we already

processed. Also, since reels 57, 58 and 59 contain

personnel files, we may determine, after reviewing the film,

that these can be denied in full.

By reviewing the film

more carefully, we may be able to find other reels that need

not be copied.

Another cost that we should factor in should

be the cost of a microfilm reader, if we are unable to

obtain a loaner.

2. I am told that each roll of microfilm averages 2400

images, so we are dealing with a large volume of 172,000

images. Converted to paper, this would fill an entire skid,

or two skids, if we had two copies of each image made.

Another way of looking at the volume is to consider that the

DO previously printed 45 reels of microfilm which filled 35

boxes. Using this ratio, 72 reels would fill 56 boxes.

would be hard pressed to store this many additional

documents. One option we could explore would be to have

P&PG phase the job over a period of time where they would

process only a few reels at a time. Unless we can find

vaulted storage space in Rosslyn, we may be forced to send

some completed boxes

to the records center for temporary

storage.

3. As explained to John Carver last year, this job

would be sent to an off-site contractor by P&PG. The

process involves transferring the microfilm images directly

onto a paper roll, uncut, thus, the person doing the job

would not see the hard copies. P&PG would then bring the

roll back to Has and cut it in to individual pages.
