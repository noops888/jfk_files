OPERATIONAL SUMMARY:

Rolando CUBELA Secades

19

January 1933, Cuba

Twice married.

Was divorced by his first wife

by whom

he had one child.

Has one child by

second wife.

Rolando CUBELA Secades was one of the activist

student leaders who assisted in the overthrow

of Batista and later turned against the Castro

regime because of disaffection with communism.

As early as March 1952, CUBELA was working

against Batista.

With student friends, including

the four Humboldt Street martyrs made famous

in the Marcos Rodriguez trial,

CUBELA re-instituted

the University Student Federation or Directorate -

FEU or

DR, as it is called.

In 1956, CUBELA

participated in the assassination of Lt. Col.

Antonio BLANCO Rico of Batista's Military

Intelligence (SIM).

Fleeing to the USA, he

became involved in military planning and purchasing

arms until l February 1958,

when he and 16 other

students returned clandestinely and into the

Escambray to

fight.

He led a

famous column,

became the overall DR military leader.

Although

the DR joined military forces with Castro's

26 July Movement, they refused Ernesto "Che"

Guevarra's military leadership, fighting only

under CUBELA'S orders.

They occupied the

Presidential Palace when Batista fled on

1 January 1959 and initially declined to turn

it over to Guevara and Castro. In October 1959,

CUBELA became president of the government-

sponsored FEU, afte, resuming his medical

studies at Havana University.

In 1961,

after

his term ended, he terminated his _connection

with the regime because of serious disagreements'

with Castro and Guevara:

I. In March 1961, CUBELA went to the Latin

American Peace Conference in Mexico there

he was contacted by a personal friend,

Carlos Tepedino (AVWHIP/1) who knew

Jack Stewart (in true name) from Havana

and introduced them.

The KUBARK objective

of the meeting was

to determine whether

CUBELA was

anti-Castro

and;

if so, to bring

his vievs

to the attention of the authorities

in the United States.

-2-

In August 1962 CUBELA went to the Helsinki

World Youth Festival where he was met by

Tepedino who introduced William Wainwright

under the alias William "Bill" Thompson.

This was a follow up to the first meeting

with the objective of inducing and

facilitating CUBELA'S defection.

due to CUBELA'S plans, the objective became

an attempt to set up an internal dissident

group for the overthrow of the Government

and sabotage. CUBELA said he was not in-

terested in any small undertaking, and declared

the assassination of Fidel and other leaders

would be the most effective way to rescue

the revolution from the Communists.

Later in August 1962 CUBELA "went on vacation"

in Paris where he met "Bill Thompson" again

and KUBARK sought more information on his

proposal to overthrow Castro.

CUBELA also

discussed the need for the U.S. to become

more deeply involved with LA students who,

ten years later, would be on the road to

becoming key figures in LA governments.

Tepedino was present at most of these meetings.

In late August-early September, 1962, CUBELA

was taken to a U.S. Air Force Base in

southern France where he was given a

demonstration in explosives.

CUBELA had

thought of blowing up an oil refinery and

was also considering the elimination of

Carlos Rafael Rodriguez,

the Soviet Ambassador,

and Fidel himself.

CUBELA was not given any

sabotage equipment but was trained in SW.

Earl Williamson (true name) accompanied

CUBELA on this trip but was always called

"Jaime" "by CUBELA.

Jack "Red" Stent (as

Jack Stevens) and a TSD SW technician under

the assumed name of Capt. David L.

Harper

also accompanied CUBELA.

In Septemuer 1003, COBELA was mit in forts

Alegre,

Brazil, by "Bill Thompson" and by

Naster Sachs the latter using the name an

"Nicolas Sanson". Tepedino was

also present

at these meetings.

CUBELA claimed he had

written

two SW messages

with FI (one was

received) but nothing significant had been

happening in Cuba.

He said he was reluctant

to

use

SW because he feared the efficiency

of

the Cubag, postal censorship.

He cited a group of Cuban military officers

and discussed ways to approach them.

The

pröblem was, he explained, that although

many of them were anti-Communist,

they were

loyal to Fidel or they were so afraid, they

were reluctant to discuss any conspiracies

for fear they might be provocations.

CUBELA

was of the opinion that.

there was no organized

conspiracy within the military or in other

groups in the country.

Internal security

and controls were effective and improving

daily.

At this meeting CUBELA volunteered

the information that he thought highly

of Ramon GUIN Diaz (AMTRUNK/10) who was

hiding Miguel DIAZ Isalgue (AMICE/14, an

infiltration asset who was sent in to recruit

Guin, and did so).

CUBELA said he planned

to use Guin but he was concerned about his

nervous condition and the fact he drank

heavily.

CUBELA was told to assist Guin

and let him remain in Cuba rather than help

to leave the country as CUBELA proposed.

From Porto Alegre, CUBELA went to Paris on

14 September 1963 where he met with Tepedino,

"Nicolas Sanson",

Jack "Red" Stent, Richard

Long.

CUBELA was attending the Alliance

Francaise in Paris at the time.

It was

learned

the french

were unilaterally

surveilling CUBELA whereupon we advised

them our contact with him was an attempt

to defect him.

On 15 October CUBELA insisted

that he meet U.S. Attorney General Robert

Kennedy because he believed Kennedy ran Cuban

affairs.

"Sanson's" position at the time was:

"We do

not consider CUBELA is working for us

but since we have a' common objective, we are

willing to render support.'n

CUBELA went on

vacation and on his. return

on 29 October 1963, it was arranged for

Desmond FitzGerald,

under

the name

"James

Clark", to meet CUBELA at Stent's home that

tay as 27 nissary of the policy level-of

the Government.

"Clark" made the following

statement "The Us is prepared to render

all necessary assistance to any anti-Communist

sufficient control to invite the. u.s.

to render

the assistance it is prepared to give. "Clark.

assured CUBELA of moral support for any

activity in this direction which CUBELA might

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY:

SECRET

-4-:

The highlights

of CUBELA'S reaction to this

proposal were:

The majority of the Cuban

people

against Castro, but mainly because

did nothing

about it.

Castro's primary support

comes from the young teenage militia group.

b.

Many high ranking military officers are

anti-Communist

are convinced Castro must

go but they are afraid to organize or even talk

against Castro to other people.

This fear and

Castro's control of the Government

(security, military, defense committee, economy,

etc.) make it extremely difficult to organize a

coup against him.

C.

If Castro falls, the military will

probably break up

into

four or five groups.

Without Castro, the present regime will dis-

integrate.

Unless there is strong and immediate

support,

the situation can easily become chaotic.

Nothing

of an operational nature was discussed

at this meeting.

After the meeting, CUBELA

stated he was satisfied with the policy discussion

but he

now desired to know what technical support

we could provide him.

8.

On 19 November 1963 it was decided at

Headquarters that we would advise CUBELA

would receive a cache inside Cuba.

requested it, the cache would include sabotage

material, C-4 and equipment, high power rifles

with scopes, hand grenades, pistols, etc.

9.

On 22 November 1963, "Sanson" met CUBELA who

asked for 20 hand grenades, two high powered

rifles with scopes

and approximately 20

pounds of C-4 and related equipment in the

cache.

He had refused to carry any in-

criminating euipnent with him on his return

to Cuba:

CUBELA spoke again

about Guin and

his concern for Guin's security (it had

never

been admitted to CUBELA that Guin was

recruited by Diaz).

When the meeting broke up:

"Sanson" and-CUBELa were informed about

President Kennedy's

assassination.

CUBELA was

"Why do

sion thing-

visibly moved and asked: At this as well as

happen to good people?"

CUBELA was given small suns

of money to cover personal expenses.

According to the news, the cache

was discovered by a small boy.

In February

1965, CUBELA said portions of the cache were

recovered by a fisherman.

The pesos were

not usable due to type.

He never received

any part of the cache, he said.

On 30 August 1964,

Jorge Carlos ROBRENO

(AMLASH/2 "El Mago"

; a Cuban refugee in

Madrid, and Cdte. Efigenio Ameifeiras, Vice

Minister of Special Affairs MINFAR, put out

feelers

to ANWORLD saying they were out of

step with the regime and wanted to talk to

AMBIDDY/1 (Artime).

ROBRENO was staying

with Jose Luis GONZALEZ Gallarreta (QUHOPS/1),

an attache at the Cuban Embassy in Madrid.

Then Alberto BLANCO Romariz (AMLASH/3) arrived

in Madrid on 2 September 1964 as a refugee.

He talked to Mr. James Noel and Anthony

Sileo on 15 September 1964 with Gonzalez

Gallarreta making the introduction.

He

spoke vaguely about CUBELA'S plan to

assassinate Castro.

He said that Tepedino

was responsible for delivering into Cuba one

FAL with Silencer.

CUBELA waS to be ine

trigger man with the support of unidentified

military officers.

Noel and Sileo reprimanded

BLANCO and

said their conversation

was

all

a waste of

time.

On

11 November 1964, CUBELA went to Prague

as

a special guest of the International

Union of Students (IUS).

His trip was

arranged at his request

by Jose VENEGAS

Valdespino, a Cuban

vice president of IUS

and a personal friend.

On

13 November

Artime agreed to talk to Cubela,.

as

the

outside contact of the internal 26th of July

and DR internal dissidents.

At a meeting

with "Sanson" on 6/7 December, Cubela told

"'Sanson" he was going to meet Artime. The

meeting with Artime took place on 27 December

1964.

Present were CUBELA,

ARTIME, Jorge

Carlos ROBRENO, Alberto BLANCO Romariz, Nilo

Messer and Miguel "Cuco" de Leon.

During

the meeting, after they were alone, CUBELA

explained his position, plans, needs, etc.,

to Artime and an agreement was reached.

Artime provided Cubela with a silencer for

an FAL.

On 1/2 February 1965

, Cubela requested

$10,000 from

"Sanson" to finance his

operations.

It was refused on 3 February.

Instead Tepedino gave Cubela $7,000, $5,000

of which had been provided by KUBARK and

$2,000 by Tepedino.

Cubela returned to Cuba on 23 February 1965:

CIA has had no further direct contact with

Cubela, and he has not utilized his SW

to us since that time..

On 23 February 1965, CA/PA passed a letter

through the

AMSNEAK operation to UNSNAFU/25

implying that Cubela, i.e.,

"one of the

Comandantes" had recently received an

additional $5,u0d in nis secret bank account.
