Remy airtel, 7/30/60, covering re-organization of personnel in

the MANNARINO controlled gambling casino, New Kensington, Pa.

A PCI, who is close to the activities of the MANNARINO gambling

Pittsburgh National Top Hoodlum SAM MANNARINO destroyed several lA.

hundred multiple coin pin ball machines at the Ken Iron and Steel

Co. and had them buried on his property adjoining the family

drive-in theater in nearby lower Burrell Township owned by his

brother, Pittsburgh National Top Hoodlum GABRIEL MANNARINO.

PA

According to the informant, SAM MANNARINO ordered his machines

destroyed to avoid the possibility of a raid on his warehouse

the PSP.

As a matter of info, the AG of Pennsylvania recently declared

multiple cointpin ball machines illegal.

This ruling was followed

by a series of raids by the PSP in which literally thousands

of machines were confiscated.

The State Supreme Court recently

apheld the AG ruling and on 8/4/60 the PSP publicly burned

hundreds of such machines near Pittsburgh.

No new cases opened ordreferred to other agencies.
