Professor Walter Rostow

Austin, Texas 78746

Dear Professor Rostow:

We greatly appreciate the time you have devoted to

cooperating with the Committee's inquiry.

The Chairman

has asked me to levy one additional request upon you.

To complete the record on the events under considera-

tion in your testimony of July 9 before the Committee,

would you please prepare a notarized, sworn affidavit

answering the following questions:

1.

What recollections do you have concerning

the subjects discussed at your meeting

with MeGeorge Bundy and Richard Bissell at

the Hay-Adams Hotel on January 27, 1961?

2. Do you recall or have a record of any

other meetings, whether official or in-

formal, between yourself and Richard

Bissell between November 1, 1960 and

March 1, 1961? Was there

any discussion

between yourself and Richard Bissell upon

any of these occasions or in phone con-

versations during the same period that

was related in any way to the establishment

of a CIA project which included the capability

to assassinate foreign leaders?

What was the

content of any such discussions?

Thanks very much for your help in this matter.

Sincerely,

Frederick A. 0. Schwarz, Jr.

Chief Counsel

Bissell testified: "There is little doubt in my mind that Project

RIFLE was discussed with ROSTOW and possibly BUNDY."

(6/11, P. 46)

He recalls that the conversations would have involved the general

capability ot perpetrating assassination, "all aspects of the

BISSELL testified that after Jan. 21, 1961 he met with ROSTOW

"quite frequently and very informally," occasionally several times

a week. (0/9, P. 81

BISSELL said that shortly after the advent of the JFK Administra-

there were weekly luncheon meetings at the State Department

with BUNDY, ROSTOW, CIA, State people and Defense. No agenda.

(6/9, D. 81) BISSELL testified the "two urgings" from the White

House could have come at successive meetings of this sort. But in

reporting on EXECUTIVE ACTION, he felt that rather than reporting

on developments to the luncheon meetings "as I normally operated

"If we can devise a policy for dealing with CASTRO short of a

TRUJILLO ASSASSINATED

ROSTO testified: "the generalized flow of intelligence at that

time involved reports of plots to assassinate TRUJILLO... like

once every week.

And why we had to give guns to people who

had access to guns in the Dominican military I don't know...I can't

reconstruct the operation." (Rocky,178)

Guns were tightly controlled

by DR Army.

ROSTOW MEMO TO TIE PRESIDENT RE CUBA

"I have not been following the matter closely over recent

months." Discusses "Soviet military deliveries to Cuba."

Under "Covert, Action"; ROSTOW said that the "limited, U.S.-

dominated, professional covert capability against CUBA"' does

not promise "a broadly-based political movement capable of

challenging the CASTRO regime's control system." (p. 5, #1)

Does this argue for assassina-

tion as quicker more direct

approach? Or does it imply that

the "control system"' would ait-

live CASTRO, rendering assassina-

tion pointless?

successie: CaA-backed everthrow of President Jacobo Arberz in Guate-

The Cuban operation, as it evolved, acquired, of course, a momentum of

conviction that they wouid not be let down. it was inconceivable that they

would be stranded.*

But Kennedy did ho!d to his policy. The operation had failed. And Castro

had to be dealt with in other ternis.

Sitting in the White House shelter, I began by listing on a yellow pad

the specific dangers to the American interest that night arise from Castro's

Cuba: the training and infitrating of subversive agents and guerrillas; the

invasion of neighboring states with Soviet arms; Soviet missiles aimed against

the United States; an attack on Guantanamo or the Panama Canal; commu-

nist radio propaganda; and an example of economic and social development

that would prove attractive in Latin America.

For each I suggested lines of action legally and morally open to the

United! States and!, especially, to the hemisphere acting in concert on tic

principle of colicctive self-defense.

I called Robert Kennedy from the shelter and told him I would be ready

to respond to his question by morning. The next day I went to Hickory Hill

bottom of the initial bureaucratic confusion in the Latin American AID

office. The result was that American resources, even those committed as

icans, were not flowing out to Latir America at the promised rate in the

first tovo years.

Nevertheless, from 1961 Latin America, out of the interplay of its own

dynamics and Kennedy's leadership, was off on a new course.

Cuba was part of it. And Che Guevara undoubtedly chleyed his role at

Everyone went home reasonably well satisfied. What made the exercise

work was the really, beneath the surface of many tensions and diferences, of

on titimate loyalty to the Inter-American system. No one could dictate the

outcome, which, indeed, had to be created on the spot. On the other hand,

there was aiso a sense that all the various attudes in play had to be recen-

ciled, in one way or another.

Rusk was the first American secretary of state who entered with depth,

sensibility, and respect into the human emotions and politics that shaped!

Latin American diplomacy. He treated his Latin American colleagues pre-

cisely as he did his European colcagues: as mature men, working out ot

difficuit domestic settings, trying to make some order, trying to build islands

of security and progress in a dangerous worid. In his dealings with Latin

Americans of those from other developing regions, he whoily lacked the

implicit condescension of the Atlanticist view. He took them all as fellow

members of the trade union of foreign ministers; and this was a great strength

at Punta del Este.

Kennedy was pleased with the result, which reconciled his objective of

getting effective collective action without either splitting the OAS or putting

the United States at crosspurposes with the Latin American countries which

, found anti-Castro mensures an additional burden on their domestic political

life. He did asi, somewhat wistfully; why we had not generated i better

press: reporting of the conference had generally portrayed the ellort as essen-

tiaily an American arm-twisting exercise rather than as an effort to reconcile

thie interests of Caribbean and non-Caribbean states within the OAS.

Kennedy was determined to avoid in his time "another Cuba" in the

hemisphere. And he quictly set in motion contingency thought on how the

United States might move, if possible with others, to prevent it. The second

Punta del Este meeting proviced a political and legal basis for such a course;

although it did not determine what could and would be done in particular

circumstances.

It was the outcome of the Cuba missile crisis which lifted, for a time, the

weight of communist pressure on Latin Americh; but that crisis arose not

out of the pelitical dynamics of a developing region but from the other dimen-

sion of the post-Sputnik o!lensive: nuclear blackmail and the point a which

Khrushchev had chosen to test its eMicacy- Berlin.

January-February 1961: ROSTOW testifies that he had never heard the phrase

"EXECUTIVE ACTION CAPABILITY" until it was mentioned on the phone to him by

Davia Belin. (174)

ROSTOW recalls hearing President Johnson make vague references to assassina-

tion type activities that the CIA may have been carrying on in Latin America.

ROSTOW said that "two or three times in my hearing" LBJ mentioned that

"without hard evidence he had a feeling that the assassination of President

Kennedy might have been carried out at the instigation of Castro" and that

there might have been attempted assassinations "in which the United States

might have been involved". (174-5)

ROSTOW said, "the statements included, as I recall it, on all occasions,

perhaps three occasions when I heard him make it, a disclaimer of having

any hard evidence and I didn't think it was my business to probe him on

this matter." (175)

ROSTOW said that the most complete statement to this effect was made when

LBJ was taping a CBS show. (175)

ROSTOW testified that LBJ discussed the assassination of JFK, he displayed

"a very clear impulse that he had which was to leave behind him a sense

of reservation about the possible connection of Oswald to Cuba and possibly

U.S. action." (176) ROSTOW explained that this referred to U.S. action

against CUBA. (176)

ROSTOW commented generally that "the only rule that I think livable with

the international community is that . . : governments not engage in efforts

to assassinate the heads of other governments." (177). ROSTOW said that

"one exception that I know of in modern history which I regard as legitimate

was the engagement of our people in the plan to assassinate Hitler." (177)

ROSTOW said that if the "end product of our giving arms to certain men would

be the assassination of Trujillo . .

• I think we shouldn't have engaged in

it." (177)

TRUJILLO: ROSTOW said that "the generalized flow of intelligence at that

time involved reports of plots to assassinate Trujillo. . . like once every

week. And why we had to give guns to people who had access to guns in the

Dominican military, I don't know.

And I can't reconstruct the operation

that has been described to you." (178)

ROSTOW testified that "I don't believe the United States should engage in

the business of political assassination." (178-9) "What we can do is to be

scrupulous in not getting the United States involved in anything which

measurably increases the possibility of killing a chief of state. Now, how

you draw a line in implementing that policy depends on very detailed judgments

at the time and in context." (179-180)

ROSTOW

testified that when he took over as Special Assistant to the President

for National Security Affairs (1966), which put him in control of the 303

Committee, he instituted "a procedure of reexamining the whole body of covert

operations that were then in motion." (181) "Out of my experience I don't

recall an occasion when we had to review an action which might lead to an

assassination." (182)

ROSTOW said that President Kennedy in 1961, sent a special letter to all

ambassadors making them the head of the CIA country team in their country.

(183) ROSTOW said "I don't believe we ever cleared a CIA operation which

the ambassador did not approve." (184)

ROSTOW said that under the mandate that the President gave to ambassadors

in 1961, an ambassador was "to be in effect the President's man on the spot,

and he had the power to appeal to the Secretary of State and indeed, to

the President, if he felt that any member of his country's team, from

whatever agency. was operating in ways that were contrary to his judg-

ment of what appropriate action was within the President's policy in that

country." (184) -- Note: Does this cast new light on the actions of the

ambassador in the Dominican Republic in requesting arms?

President's working style as well as to his policy. Having seen and done

some work in Washington under sir successive Presidents, I still find it

remarkable how that massive burcaucracy shifts its styie, tone, and manner

as Presidents come and go, white maintaining, in each et is departmenss,

a stubborn continuity of its own.

There will always be those who believe they know better than the

Presicient what cught to be done, who believe if he were only belier in-

'ormed, he would agree with them. And they may postpone, dellect, dilute,

even defy orders-or take their case to the press. There will always be

abicing burcaucratic vested interests and habits. For example, Kennedy

once, in his carly days as President, wanted a sign removed which he

thought inappropriate. He asked, casually, that a subordinate take care of

the matter. He was toid a few days later by the attorney general that il

was still there. He tried again. The effort failed. He finally determined the

obscure unit of bureaucracy which had responsibility, the exact poin

within it where power. over signs lay, and personally gave the order. Hs

concluded: "I understand now. A Presicent must say something three tinie:

to be obeyed." And most Presidents will find something like this true, fro:?

time to time, in far graver matters.

But when al! this inevitable personal proprictorship over the nationa

interest and bureaucratic inertia is taken into account, the responsivenes

of the exccutive branch to the single individual who leads it is a kind o

minor recurrent miracie.

It took some time, but the military and foreign policy compler wa

reshaped by Kennedy. The heart of it lay in two men: his secretary o

defense and his secretary of state.

In Robert S. Mc. Vamara he found a man to whom he was prepared ti

McNamara chose his own team of civilian subordinates. And, with Max

sidcrations bearing on the problem. In McNamara's time the Pentagon!

generated, of course, an ample range of difterences with the State Depart-

noner working levels. These were usually quietly resolved uy the two

secretaries. The intimacy, ease, and mutual loyalty with which McNamara

and Rus worked was only matched in the post-1945 years, perhaps, by

the Acheson-Lovett team in the Truman administration.

Dean Rusk was at least as self-disciplined as McNamara, but in a

essary. He knew aiso that, in the world as it was in the goos, force was

nescapable element in the equation of diplomacy. For example, his

"st request of me, between Kennedy's clection and the Inaugural, was to

set down the best answer I could to the thought most on his mind: How do

we deal with the world while avoiding nuclear war? He ster referred to

"'is trade union" of foreign ministers. He felt it to be a club of men whose.

duty it was to see if the human race could come through a terrible passage

of history without destroying civilization. His evident sincerity on this

ain: was recognized by his colleagues and often evoked an answering

Ac'ministratively, Rusk's problem was vastly more compler than

Vc.Vamara's because Kennedy was determined to deal intimaiely wit

neign aairs and to reshape foreign policy, piece by picce. Vic.Vamara's

corgunization of the Pentagon and of the American force structure was,

-whans, even more radical than Kennedy's innovations in forcign policy:

" Kennedy did not monitor that reorganization in the way he engaged

ereign policy.

For a strong President the difference was inevitable. The President is,

iscopably, a major cay-to-day actor in foreign affairs, as well as the

architect of foreign policy. He meets and negotiates directly with an endless

situation Rusk felt they should accept with the same equanimity is officers

who execute orders without knowing all the considerations which led the

commanding genera! to issue them. On the other hand, within the State

Department Rusk encouraged at planning mectings of senior aides wide-

ranging discussions, including. the advancing of "unthinkable thoughts."

In the nore or less regular sessions we had together, usually over the week-

end, when I was Statc Department planner, he was speculative, reflective,

and candid. But advising the President was his ultimate duty, as he saw it,

along with executing the President's decisions. The only show of emotion

I ever saw Rusk allow himself was in a disheartened and disheveled meet-

ing immediately after the Bay of Pigs debacle. It took place in the Cubinet

Room. The President had stepped out. He pounded the arn: of the Presi

dent's chair and said: "It is this man we must think about."

Unlike McNamara, Rusk did not choose all or even, many of his

initial suborcinates. Ee lived and worked with an array of men Kennedy

wished to see engaged on one aspect or another of forcign aflairs. This

Rusk accepted, dealing with all in an even-handed, reserved wily which

did not exclude moments of sensibility and humor, as well as shrewd assess-

ment. Like a high-ranking general in the field, he accepted the flow of

subordinates that came his way as decreed by distant higher authority;

although, also like a high-ranking general, he used his influence occasion-

Both the President and his advisers were caught up in the igoos in a

little noticed but quite revolutionary change in the scale and intensity of

foreign affairs which had occurred in the period between, say, 1945 and!

root. The change in scale arose from the coming to statchood of a great

many former colonial nations. Vembership in the Crited Nations,

exampic, was 59 in 1949, and 112 in 1963. Even more important, hew-

ever, was the growing intensity of the probiems in the southern continents,

as the crive for modernization accelerated and the focus of the Cold War

struggle came to rest upon them.

" is chly a partiai exaggeration to say that the secretary of state from

1945 to 19.52 was a super-assistant secretary of state for Europe. America

faced difficult probiems in postwar China; the Japanese occupation and

the Treaty; the troubled birth of Israel; and war in Korea. But Latin Amer-

ca was quiet. The ferment in Africa, the Middle East, South and South-

cost Asia was primarily a heacache for the European colonial powers.

Achesons life as secictary of state was overwhelmingly taken up with prob-

ens dong the axis from Loncon to Moscow. His most important act in

sion American policy was, perhaps, to order George Kennan's explosive

-sport of March 950 to be sequestered-"locked away and hidden from

mocent eyes."" Acheser's advice to Truman that tie United States face

up to the arach in Korea in tune 1950 was determined rather more by his

concern for the balance of power in Europe than in Asia: he viewed the

nitaci as a direc: challenge by Moscow to Washingtor that had to be met

nascent NATO were to emerge as viable.

Kennedy and Johnson, Rusk and McNamara dealt with a quite

Terent world. The plane: had become a singie, sensitively interacting

glebal community. From the point o! view of American policy, as well as

wussian and Chinese, history had destroyed the shield of colonialism; and

Jatin America was in a new state of ferment. In the tooes the intensity

of communications between Latin America and Washington, and the

gravity of the issues, almost matched those of Europe in the immediate

postwar years. Africa, the Middle East, and Asia proved capable of gen-

crating. at any moment, crises of the first order of magnitude; and this

meant they required endless attention and monitoring, even in apparently

quiet times. In short, the traditional orientation of American foreign policy

across she Worth Atlantic had demonstrably ended.

"tis this revelution in the world's political structure that explains

more than anything eise the rise in importance of the post of special assist-

ant:o the President for national security alairs.

the structure created by the Nationa! Security Act of 1947 and the advisory

counch it set in motion.

From the begining, the heart of the matter lay in two quite distinct

problems: first, how the President chose to receive advice on national

security matters; second, how coordinated stalt work should be generate!

among all the arms of national security policy at a time when diplomacy

itself, in the old-fashioned sense, no longer sullicce!. Intelligence, forcign

aid, information projected overseas, stockpiling at home, and, above all,

military policy had to be woven together with conventional diplomacy.

On the first issue, Truman, like his successors (including Bisen-

hower), did not use extensively the full formal structure of the National

Security Council (NSC) in actually arriving at critical operational deci-

sions. He sought the advice of the men he wanted to hear when he wanted

to hear them on specific matters as they arose—notably, George Marshal!

and Dear. Acheson, Robert A. Lovett and Averell Harriman.

With respect to the second problem, coorcinated stall work wils gen-

erated, based on older wartime and immediate postwar precedents, bring-

ing State and Defense closer together; for example, the re-examination of

military policy after the first Soviet nucicar explosion in 1949, called NSC

68.

When the Soviet Union acquired nuclear weapons, and the possibilities

of a stando! in major weapons became more real, the psychological cle-

ment in the struggle also rose in priority. After a protracted examination,

the problem of psychologica! warfare came lo be conceived primarily as

the task of making and executing a policy that would dramatize the areas

of overlap between the purposes of the United States and these of other

nations.

The Eisenhower administration recognized and accepted this conclu-

sion when in 1953 it converted the Psychologica! Strategy Board into thei

Operations Coordinating Board, whose function was to assure coordinated

execution of policy decisions already arrived a by the President.

Eisenhower also clevated the formal status of the NSC and the NSg

in the Eisenhower administration, concluded: "If we make Ike sit through

many more of these pointiess meetings, we'll literally kill him.

The reason for this atrophy was quite simple. A strong secretary.Of

-state does not wish to "place" critical" and sensitive issues into interdepart

meatat-commiticesmewyccially when they expand out to include representa-

tves of departments only marginally invoived. Foster Dulles was cute

copubie c! translating this wish inio action. A strong secretary of defense

may wish to lay his hands on some of the key issues of diplomacy, but

cous not wish his critical pieces of business spread about for general debate

and acrice. So, also, with a strong secretary of the treasury; ard most na-

onal secanty probicms have price tags attached to "em. Thus, extremely

ase men were busy, day after day, drafting papers on prostems where the

key components were missing.

After citing the many departments and agencies involved in foreign

aTairs. Eisenhower's own conclusion was this:

Policy decisions affecting these far-flung operations were my re-

spons:bility, out for daily coordination, I early organized the Opera-

ions Coordinating Beard (OCB). Its membership included

important oficinis of agencies which were directly in charge of spe-

cilic forcign operations. It functioned fairly we!!.

However, I came

Snaily to believe that this work could have been better cone by a

Nighly competent and trusted official with a small stall of his own.

rather than by a committee whose members had to handle the task on

a part-time basis."

Indeedi, for this very reason, a key figure in the Eisenhower adminis-

vation wradrew Goodpaster, functioned as a personal cite. Foreshadowing

sis MeSeorge Buncy and his successors would undertake, Goodpaster

eat with all manner of national security probiems requiring the Presi-

cent's participation, on occasions when the secretary of state or defense, thic

«rector of Central Intelligence, the chairman of the AEC, etc., did not

cheese to take up the matter directly with the President.

All this was quite well known to Kennedy when he asked Bundy and

me to go to work in the White House on national security affairs-a

perspective underlined for him by a special report of Senator Henry Jack-

son's Subcommittee on National Policy Machinery, published shortly after

he 1çdo clection. We knew Kennedy would wis? our advice on how to

organize or dispose of the machinery and star we had inherited, We

tely discussed the problem in Cambridge before going to Washington;

agreed we would proansly recommend a simpler pian, but agreed, also,

that we should study the situation on the spot rather than recommend

action on the basis c! our existing information and prejudice.

who had helped operate the machinery; and probed hard at the question

of whether a reform of the existing machinery could render it vital.

I concluded! that the problem of getting full cooperation from the

Department of Staie was insurmountable, because i strong secretary of

state could, would!, and, perhaps, should keep out of large interdepart-

mentai committees critical clements in the diplomatic equation. I agreed,

in chect, with a dictum of C. D. Jachson's addressed to precisely this

problem: "Since you can't lick 'em, join 'em." Itheretore proposed that ther

in the papers: had read was an essential part of government; and such

working-level papers should be available to the President. They represented

raw materials which the President's senior advisers should have available:

but they were not-and could not be-focused with sullicient precision on

the issues the President would have to decide at a particular moment.

Bundy had arrived at a similar conclusion.

We took our plan to kennedy, who approved. But he noted that we

were somewhat odd bureaucrats: here we were, handed a substantial

empire-slots, budgets, and all-and our first recommendation was to liqui-

date a good part of it.

The essential decision was to separate two parts of the abiding NSC

probiem: assistance to the President in preparing for and executing his

decisions; and the task of interdepartmental stalt work. The latter we

would monitor with our small staft, but not try to manage from day to day.

Acheson, I beliove, misjudged the matter. If he had served as secretary of

state in the robos, he would, I suspect, have recognized the need for, inc

welcomed, the Bundy staff. The flow of business that orly the Presideng

tions coming forward—-notably the options sejected or washed out

by burcaucratic compromise and the precise reasons why others

were proposed;

4. to assist the President in his expanded personal role in diplomacy:

spceches, visitors, and foreign correspondence; press contacts and

trips abroad; bricfings for mectings with his advisers;

5. lonele sure the President's decistons were executed:

A man charged with this kind of responsibility ought to be one whose

judgment the President would wish to hear, among others, before he made

a decision. Kennedy and Johnson did solicit the views of their special

assistants for national security alairs. But the existence of the post emerged!

from brute necessity, not as an effort to dilute the powers of the secretaries

of state and defense.

Kennedy was, from the first, lucid about the mission of his special

assistant for national security affairs. He explained it in identical terms to

Rusk, McNamara, Bundy, and me. He did not wish us to substitute for the

secretaries of state and defense. He was conscious of Franklin Roosevelt's

icchnique of creating overlapping authorities and profiting from the fric-

ten, and he wanted no part of it-No decision in their fields" would be

taken without hearing the two secretaries" and giving their advice heavy

paight. On the other hand, he wanted to make sure-that-he-had-available -

te be imprisoned by the options the bureaucracies might generate and lay

befcie him. It was the duty of the special assistant for national security

alfairs to assure that independent statement of the options.

Many other functions emerged, but those were our instructions in

January 1961.

Kennedy had initially thought I might take the post of State Depart-

ment planner. For good and sufficient reasons Rusk preferred an old

friend and collague, George McChee. For ten months I functioned as

deputy special assistant to the President for national security affairs.

There was plenty for both Bundy and me to co. We first split up

the crises. He desk Cuba, the Conger and-Berin, although I joined in the

It was not an ideal bureaucratic arrangement, especially for Bundy.

But the urgency of the tasks, old friendship, mutual respect, and devotion

to a common boss made it viable; and there was more than enough for

soth of us to co. I moved to the planning job at State when McGhee was

crated to the post of deputy under secretary of state, in a massive reorga-

mation c November zool.

Given the responsibilities borne by the United States in the logos, 1

would guess something much like Bundy's post would have had to be

invented later if it had not been created in January 1961. 1 am inclined 10

think Rusk and McNamara would agrec.

Bundy's mission, as it emerged, is to be understood primarily as a

substantial expansion of Goodpaster's role under Eisenhower, He became

a major source of advice, as well as organizer of advice, for the President.

But Bundy executed his mission with extraordinary sensitivity to the pre-

rogatives of the secretaries of state and defense. He was constantly aware

of the need to bring and hold close together the three critical actors: the

President, Rusk, and McNamara. What the bureaucracy saw was the vital

new figure, and his lively staft, probing, questioning, voraciously gathering

intelligence and cables, making sure the President's interests, outlook, and

decisions were effectively communicated to the bureaucracy. What the

burcaucracy did not see was Bundy's awareness. of the problems confronted

by Rusk and McNamara, and his quiet actions to try to lighten their bur-

dens as well as the President's.

A word about planning. As Kennedy came to grips with the ines-

capable crises on the national agenda, he interested himself personally in

the design of a planning program. The planners themselves met wotkiy

treatment or some other form of Presidential decision within two or three

menths.

The general image of Kennedy's first days as President is sometimes

projected is one of light-hearted improvisation until the sobering experi-

ence of the Bay of Pigs. For those engagec intimately with him in foreign.

aftairs, it was a sober-even somber--time from the beginning, although

confronted with a certain visceral good cheer. He once greeted Bundy and

me as we came into his ofice: "What's gone against us today?"

But it was also a time of planning, of looking ahcad to better days.

Some of the planning exercises launched then rar into the sand; others

laid the foundations for major lines of action.

I recall in those early days running into a party of four late one cold

night, between the White House and the Excutive Office Building. The

two lead characters plodding through the snow could be identified by the

glow of cigars at markedly diferent levels. They turned out to be the

President and his shorter companion, Charles Bartlett, accompanied by a

pair of men from the Secrct Scrvice. Kennedy, evidently in a cheerful

mood, asked why I was working so late. I told him I had a tough boss.

Briefly serious, he said he wanted to make sure we in the White House got

on top of planning and stayed there. Kennedy, in fact, did enter into the

planning business more deeply in those early days than any other postiar

President.

Rostow confirmed our meeting at 4:00 at Cosmos Club.

Rostow advised that

we read his book:DIFFUSION OF POWER IN

the following parts:

esp. 169-170

b) pp. 208-221, Including his comments

on his approach

to

the second

Punta del Este congerence, which is his

post Bay of Pigs approach.

On BISSELL: Rostow said he is a close social fhrma friend of

Bissell's.

I asked him to check his personal papers for any

references to conversations with Bissell between the election

and late February 1961. He said he belleved that his social.

caldndar would show that he had dinner with Bissell once or

twaice baronex during that period of time.

But he is us sure

that he did not discuss EXECUTIVE ACTION with Bissell.

Rostur said that the only professional contact he had with

Bissell during this time involved asking him to

write

a planning paper on how

to 1 organize the godernment.

Theyx Bissell was a part of the Organization of Planners

(George McGee and other planners) with which Rostow
