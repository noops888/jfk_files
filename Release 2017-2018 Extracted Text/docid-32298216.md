with the rackets for many years. He stated that SHUTRUMP has

done time in the Federal Penitentiary at Milan, Michigan, on

an income tax evasion conviction.

CV I-49 advised on July 22, 1964, he had visited

FRANK MEZZATESTA, Kent, Ohio, that evening, and while there,

MEZZATESTA'S nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE, appeared at the house,

riding a motor scooter.

CV, T-49 stated the conversation again

got around to Youngstown and both MADAFFARE and MEZZATESTA

cautioned him to stay away from Youngstown. MADAFFARE stated

that over in Italy when a man has a friend, he can

an ham end

trust him,

but stated that in Youngstown "friend kills friend."

CV T-49 stated he learned that MADAFFARE was probably

closer to DOMINICK MOIO than was MEZZATESTA.

He stated from

their conversation, he gathered that MOIO and MADAFFARE had

lived together and, although they did not say specifically,

he gathered it had been in Youngstown.

He stated he got the

definite impression that MADAFFARE had more definite infor-

mation about MOIO's activities than did MEZZATESTA.

CV T-49 advised that MEZZATESTA in talking about the

bombing of BILLY NAPLES on July 1, 1962, stated that MOIO had

been responsible and that

"they" had ordered him to do this.

He stated he, himself, liked BILLY NAPLES, but when such a

thing was ordered, he was powerless to interfere.

MEZZATESTA

also stated that MOIO made the mistake of working for too many

factions and he would work for any group for money, and that

was what finally caused his death when it was determined that

he had "hit" some member of the "organization."

CV I-49 stated

tloned who MoTo had atit" from the "arganization, " but he men-

"organization," but he

assumed they meant either CAVALLARO Or VINCENT J. DE NIRO, Who

was killed July 17, 1961, while MOIO was In the employ of

BILLY NAPLES.

CV I-24 advised on July 24, 1964, that when the barbut

game operated in Youngstown on South

Avenue, and possibly in

Struthers, Ohio, JERRY CONTI had a plece of

the game; however,

he was later cut out, apparently when CHARLES CAVALLARO Share

and was definitely out of

the game when it operated In Campbell,

Ohio.

Re:

DOMINICK MOIO - DECEASEI

CV T-1 advised on June 29, 1964,

that in conversation

on the night of June 28, 1964, he learned from his source that

DOMINICK MOIO was Involved in both the BILLY NAPLES and the

CAVATIAR bombing murders, but did not know by whom he was

employed. He stated MOIO was killed because he "knew too much,"

and whoever was involved was afraid of him. CV T-l also stated

his source told him that MOIO was allegedly a brother-in-law of

PAT FERRUCCIO of Canton, Ohio, and It was behind FERRUCCIO's

club in Canton that MOIO was killed, and the body placed in the

trunk of his car and driven to a rural section outside of Canton

where It was recovered on September 3, 1963.

CV T-51 stated on July 1, 1964, that ANGELINE CONSTANTINO,

the former girlfriend of DOMINICK MOIO, had visited him recently

on two occasions.

On one of these occasions, he stated she was

about to tell him something regarding BILLY NAPLES, but they were

Interrupted by a customer and she never completed what she was

going to say.

CV T-51 stated he has not visited CONSTANTINO at

her home because her two daughters might get the wrong impression

and tell others about his visit. CV T-51 agreed that CONSTANTINO

would undoubtedly have much information about the activities of

MOLO and his relations with BLLLY

and JOEY NAPLES.

CV T-5l pointed out that as he had previously reported,

CONSTANTINO had told him that she believed the NAPLES brothers

were responsible for MOIO's death and she had warned MOIO prior

to his death to stay away from the NAPLES.

CONSTANTINO never explained to him why she was so afrald of

the NAPLES.

CV T-51 also stated that only a short time after MOIO

met CONSTANTINO, MOIO was working behind the bar.

He stated

that at that time a Youngstown police officer named BILLY KELLY

was also a frequent visitor at the tavern operated by CONSTANIINO

and probably became as well acquainted with MOIO as did CV T-51.

He'stated that on one occasion BILLY KELLY approached him with

a request that he, ov T-51, borrow $5,000 from MOIO and that

KELLY and he would then start their own business.

He recalled

that subsequent to MOIO's death he mentioned this to KELLY,

whose remark was, "It is too bad we didn't borrow the money

because now we

wouldn't have to pay It back."

It was pointed out to cv T-51 that at the time. of

BILLY NAPIES! death, he must have had some conversation with

both MOIO and CONSTANTINO regarding NAPLES' death, since he was

aware of the friendship between MOIO and NAPLES.

He/ stated that

If there was any conversation, he does not now recall what was

said.

CV T-51 advised that recently LOU TORMA (phoretic)

(LOUIS IE PORIS), who was employed by the NAPLES brothers as

a repairman in the operation of the United Music Company, had

contacted him to buy some electronic parts. TORMA appeared

accompanied by an individual whom he described as short,

wearing a hat and glasses, and who it would appear was probably

PAUL HOLOVATICH who is associated with the NAPLES brothers in

the Center Sandwich Shop operation. He stated he Inquired of

At this point, the individual believed to be HOLOVATICH reminded

TORMA of the time he stopped the "federals" with his cár.

HOLOVATICH then terminated his statement with "those s-- b--."

He stated he does not know HOLOVATICH.

eV T-51 advised that

they had three or four dump trucks which they used to haul gravel

from Pennsylvania to Liberty Township, Ohio, north of Youngstown,

where a sewer line was being installed. CV I-51 stated that

because of the Inexperienced truck drivers whom they employed,

one of whom wrecked the truck, the business was not

successful

and folded.

It was pointed out to Cv T-51 of the FBI's intense

interest in solving the CAVALIARO bombing..

He stated he was

very interested in determining who was responsible for the killing

mation regarding MOIO's activities. He stated he did not know

personally whether MOIO

RE:

VINCENT J. DE NIRO

(Bombing-Murder Victim 7/17/61

CV I-60 was again questioned on March 26, 1964,

regarding information he had previously furnished regarding

the

bombing death of VINCENT J. DE NIRO at Youngstown (July 17,

1961): He stated that several

days before the contact,

FRANK LENTINE, Youngstown burglar, had mentioned to him

possible "house score" where a considerable amount of cash

belonging to the late DE NIRO was supposed to have been kept.

LENTINE stated that the residence Involved is the present

residence of the parents of DE NIRO and where his brother,

LOUIS DE NIRO,

resides.

According to LENtINE,

when DE NIRO

was alive he always had a barber come to his home.

according to this

barber, he was at DE NIRO's home and after

giving him a hair cut, DENIRO did not have any cash on him.

This barber stated he

usually was paid $10 or $20 for each visit.

On this particular occasion, DE NIRO, after noticing he had no

cash,

then pressed a button which opened a door leading to the

attie.

DE NIRO went into the attic and came down and gave the

barber a $10 bill.

LENTINE's belief was that the attle 1s the

location of DE NIRO's money.

i. :

Regarding VINCENT J. DE NIRO, CV T-60 stated that

according to LENTINE, prior to DE NIRO'S death, DE NIRO häd beer

shot at several times, but these instances were never reported

to the police.

He stated LENTINE made reference to several

occasions that "they" really wanted to do away with DE NIRO,

büt never further identified

"they."

LENTINE alSO

stated that "they" just prior to the death of DE NIRO, had followed

his activitles very closely and knew that DE NIRO was

using three

different autos since he was aware that someone was trying to

kill him. LENTINE further stated that at thetime of his death,

all three cars had actually been wired for explosives and that

on the Sunday evening thät DE NIRO was killed, the car that he :

a actual be no read

actually used and was blown up in, a short time before, had been

CV T-60 stated that when this car was wired with the

explosives, a truck was pulled up to the area and a man with a

machine gun was stationed inside the truck to protect the

Individuals that placed the explosives in the car.

CV T-60 stated he did not ask LENTINE who was behind

the killing of DE NIRO since he did not want to make his interest

known since this was a subject that is not generally discussed.

two organizations in Youngstown, Cleveland, or elsewhere; but

when the younger element galned control, big decisions are still

passed on by the older heads in the organizations,.

and when there

is a disagreement of what is to be done,

agreeable to this and MALLAMo told hin he would furnish the food

contractors soliciting business.

He stated the deal 1s for the

contractor to put up the sum of

the Job, and if a contract is let to that particular contractor,

then the fee is 2 percent of the contract,

up to one-half million

customer, one ART MARINELLI.

He was questioned as to the going

legitimate rate for these performance bonds, and he advised that the

operated a crap game in a building next to the Pines Nite Club

on Route 422, east of Youngstown, DITTA was working at the game.

He stated DITTA just stood

who went broke in the game.

broke one

night and DITTA loaned him $400, and he paid DITTA

back the following evening.

He stated he

always assumed that

He also recalled

from the past that DITTA was a good friend of CAVALLARO.

CV T-62 advised on June 22, 1964, when asked if he

knew NICK DITTA, that he definitely knew DITTA and that he

frequently came into the

"A" Lounge while it was in operation

in Youngstown.

CV T-62 stated he heard DITTA was a killer from

Detroit, but knew little of his activities in Youngstown or

elsewhere.

He said he felt sure that DITTA was a close friend

of "FATS"

CV T-61 advised on July 14, 1964, he had been talking

brother of PAUL ROMEO whom he

described as a "Mafia member." He stated that MIKE told him

that Mrs. DE NIRO, mother of slain Youngstown racketeer VINCENT

to avenge the death of her son.

He stated that MIKE told him

that MOIO came to Mrs. DE NIRO with the proposition.

CV T-61

stated that in this particular instance,

in his opinion, MOIO

was simply being an opportunist

since he had probably already

received the contract from the "Cleveland syndicate"

DE NIRO's death. He stated that subsequently MOIO did actively

participate in the bombing death of BILLY NAPLES (July 1, 1962)

who the syndicate felt was responsible for the bombing death

of DE NIRO (July 17, 1901) •

He reiterated the fact that sub-

sequently MOIo was

responsible for and actively participated

in the bombing death of CHARLES CAVALLARO and his son, for the

NAPLES brothers, JOEY and JIMMY, and that MOIO was subsequently

eliminated by the

"Cleveland syndicate" for his participation

in the CAVALLARO bombing.

CV T-67 advised on July 15, 1964, that he did not know

what the connection between VICTOR SHUTRUMP, Youngstown building

contractor, and NICK DITTA, Detroit hoodlum might be. He stated

with the rackets for many years.

He stated that SHutruMP has

done time in the Federal Penitentiary at Milan, Michigan, on

an income tax evasion conviction.

CV T-49 advised on July 22, 1964, he had visited

FRANK MEZZATESTA, Kent, Ohio, that evening, and while there,

MEZZATESTA's nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE, appeared at the house,

riding a motor scooter. CV T-49 stated the conversation again

cautioned him to stay away from Youngstown. MADAFFARE stated

CV T-49 stated he learned that MADAFFARE was probably

closer to DOMINICK MOIO than was MEZZATESTA.

He stated from

their conversation, he gathered that MOIO and MADAFFARE had

lived together and, although they did not say specifically,

he gathered it had been in Youngstown. He stated he got the

definite impression that MADAFFARE had more definite infor-

mation about MOIO's activities than did MEZZATESTA.

CV T-49 advised that MEZZATESTA in talking about the

bombing of BILLY NAPLES on July 1, 1962, stated that MOIO had

been responsible and that

"they" had ordered him to do this.

He stated he, himself, liced BILLY NAPLES, but when such a

thing was ordered, he was powerless to interfere.

MEZZATESTA

also stated that MOIO made the mistake of working for too many

factions and he would work for any group for money, and that

was what finally caused his death when it was determined that

he had

"hit! some member of the "organization."

"organization," but he

assumed they meant either CAVALLARO or VINCENT J. DE NIRO, who

was killed July 17, 1961, while MOIO was in the employ of

BILLY NAPLES.

CV I-24 advised on July 24, 1964, that when the barbut

game operated in Youngstown on South

Avenue, and possibly. Ir

Struthers, Ohio, JERRY CONTI had a piece of

the game; however,

he was later cut out, apparently when CHARLES CAVALLARO shared

and was definitely out of the game when it operated in Campbell,

Ohio.

interrupted by a customer and she never completed what she was

to test him something re

going to say. CV. T-51 stated he has not visited CONSTANTINO at

her home because her two daughters might get the wrong impression

and tell others about his visit. CV T-51 agreed that CONSTANTINO

would undoubtedly have much information about the activities of

CONSTANTINO had told him that she believed the NAPLES brothers

were responsible for MOIO's death and she had warned More prior

to his death to stay away from the NAPLES.: CV T-51 stated

CONSTANTINO never explained to him why she was so afraid of

the NAPLES.

CV T-51 also stated that only a short time after MOIO

met CONSTANTINO, MOIO was working behind the bar.

that at that time a Youngstown police officer named BILLY KELLY

was also a frequent visitor at the tavern operated by CONSTANTINO

and probably became as well acquainted with MOIO as did CV T-51.

He stated that on one occasion BILLY KELLY approached him with

a request that he, cv T-51, borrow $5,000 from MOIO and that

KELLY and he would then start their own business. He recalled

CV T-51 advised that in 1957, PAUL CLAUTTI of Youngs-

town and CAVALLAR were partners in a trucking company for about

three or four months.

CAVALIARO put up most of the money and

they had three or four dump trucks which they used to haul gravel

from Pennsylvania to Liberty Township, Ohio, north of Youngstown,

where a sewer line was being installed. CV I-51 stated that

because of the inexperienced truck drivers whom they employed,

one of whom wrecked the truck, the business was not successful

and folded.
