by telephone to return KOGER's call but found out he had

just gotten out of a

hospital in the San Antonio area and

could not be reached!

Informant further reported that j. C. BECKWORTH

recently had received a letter dated 10/3/68, addressed

..to

him from FRED O. WELDON, JR., a member of the Board of

Dallas Civil Liberties Union, affiliated with American Civil

Liberties Union (ACLU) , Box 12371, Dallas

75225, telephone

RI 1-4656. The stationery on which the letter was typed

identified officers of the Dallas Civil Liberties Union as

ROBERT L. LICHTEN, President; ELMER WATSON, Vice President;

and CARL BRANNING, Secretary. A copy of this letter was

directed to MR. DORAN WILLIAMS,

Texas Civil Liberties Union,

1205 B East 1lth, Austin,

The letter told BECKWORTH that WELDON had received

a letter dated 8/12/68, from DORAN WILLIAMS advising con-

cerning BECKWORTH's problems with the Tatum School District

and asked BECKWORTH if possible to come to WELDON's office

in Dallas to furnish him all factual background on which

BECKWORTH bases a claim that his dismissal from his school

job made a Civil Liberties issue.

The envelope bore the

return address "MULLINX,

WELLS,

MAUZY, LEVY, and RICHARDS,

1601 National Bankers Life Building, Dallas

75201."

(U)

According to informant, H. C. THOMPSON, former

Mayflower school bus driver, told BECKWORTH around the

first of October, 1968, that HARRY KOGER had written him

stating that BECKWORTH would be getting letters from

several sources; that. KOGER had contacted the ACLU at Austin

and BECKWORTH should be getting letters from (unidentified

persons there) Dallas, Austin, and Kaufman, Texas.

KOGER had

told THOMPSON that RONNIE DUGGER of Houston needed to have

the information that BECKWORTH could provide concerning his

own situation in order that he could publish it both about

BECKWORTH and to Tatum School District trial

of

the other

nine Negro teachers who had lost their jobs.

u 1

Informant stated BILL WILDER, Henderson,

Texas,

is BECKWORTH's attorney representing him in BECKWORTH's claim

before the State Board of Education.

That claim is based

upon failure of the Tatum School

District to complete its

contract with BECKWORTH which had never expired nor terminated.

ACTION: None.
