that something behind the Iron Curtain had been put in motion in his

behalf. Our investigation of this particular problem has come up with

the following results:

In the first place, both Chayes and licVickar have their dates

wrong.. This does not reflect on their capabilities, because they are

undoubtedly basing their conclusions upon State Department memoranda

which were in turn based upon statements made at the time by Oswald

hinself, and subsequent investigation has shown that these were probably

inaccurate. Oswald's American passport, which he of course had in his

possession at the time he traveled to Russia, was subsequently surrendered

to the Department of State, after he was repatriated, and has since been

placed in the hands of the Carmission. Stamps on this passport show that

the Soviet Iourist Visa was issued (not applied for) in Helsinki on.

October I4.. Confidential information made available from a source which

the CIA says is "very reliable" relates that Oswald arrived by airplane

from,London in Helsinki on October 10. Everything we know about his trip

points to the fact that he proceeded to his destination, Moscow, as rapidly

and as directly as his financial resources would permit. Despite state-

ments made to fellow travelers along the way that he was "only a tourist"

or "just a student on his way to college," he in fact wasted no time in

sightseeing but made connections as rapidly as he reasonably could.

Therefore, although we have no direct evidence indicating when he first

applied for a visa, it seems highly probable that he applied for it as

soon as he arrived in Helsinki, namely, on the lOth of October.

Perhaps,

howèver, his airplane arrived in Helsinki too late for him to have

reached the Consulate before it closed that evening should this have

country. it does make sense, howevery if Marina wes no portant to the

contemplated use of oswald that the additional difficulties in connection

with repatriation which would be added by the marriage, were worthhtle.

It also makes sense, of course, on the hypothests that Marine herself,

rather than Oswald, Is the fussian agent. This latter conjecture, though

pechaps somewhat startling at first, is probably at least as plausible as

the conjecture that Marina and Oswald vere agents together. At the

questioning rhich Marina has undergone since the assassination has shown

that she is an intelligent, coolheaded woman. She had a rather unfortunate

affair with her business manager after the assassination which might have

been caused by her being carried avay by her emotions. This is not

necessarily evidence that she is not. cooly calculating, however. The

incident 1s equally explatnable as a simple'miscalculation on her part

that it was either necessary or destrable trom e survivel vienoint.

Marina has stated, that Oswald's intent was to evade the travel ban by

wich appears quite firm that when Oswald appeared at the Cuban and.

he might visit that country on his way to the Soviet Union. When he

"One arrangement he made, for example, was to have passport photographs

taken, for use in his application for a Cuban visa.) By late Saturday

artemoon, September 28, however, he had pretty mich hit a blank well

at both embasstes. The Fussians had told him sumly that they had sent.

a telegram to washington about him, but that that was all they had authority

to dos they could take no further action until Washington authorized

them to do so, and that would probably be tran five to SiX months later.

The Cuban Inbassy had even more fimly informed hin that he could not get.

an in transity visa to visit Cuba unless he could Cret show them a

visa to visit Russia, so he was left with very little to do with either

Embassy except to recontact the Russian one occasionally in the faint hope

that they night have received an early reply to the telegram they supposedly

had sent to Washington.

At the Cuben Embassy he even got lato a light

In turn can be inferred that the conversations alluded to vere with Marina,

because they would have been in Russian, and ie have other evidence, which

is quite firm, that he telephoned Marina almost every night. It this is

the case, then the fact that he signed off with the word "Adlost has no

Finally, before ending our discussion of possible Cuban inyolver

allegations of Cuban conspiracies which have come to our attention. In

our opinion, only two are sufficiently serious to merit a detatled state-

rent. These are sumarized below.. The other runors. are very briefly

sumarized, and references to the basic fBI or CIA sources dealing with then

are given, in an appendix hereto.

1. Statement of Pedro Gutierrez Valencia:

On December 2, 1963 Senor Pedro Gutierrez Valencia wrote a

letter to President Johnson; in Spanish, in which be stated that in the

course of bis duties as a credit investigator for a large department store

in Mexico City he was in the Cuban imbassy in Mexico City on September 30, M

1963 or October 1, 1963 for the purpose of conducting an investigation

of one of its employees. The letter went on to say that as he was leaving

the embassy he overheard a heated discussion in/Inglish between two men,

one a Cuban and the other an American, in which he could inderstand only

the words, "Castro," "Cuba," and "emedy " The Cuban was counting out

about two blocks apart.. It therefore seems unlikely that if Oswald had

been at the Cuban Embassy he would have telephoned the Russian Embassy

rather than walked over there, especially since by this time he was familiar

with the personnel. However, it is also possible that he believed that

he could get through to speak to the Consul ii he telephoned, whereas if

he showed up in person he might be rebuffed by the receptionist or the guard

who by that time may have been able to recognize him and under orders to

keep bim out.

The CIA and FBI representatives with whom we have discussed this

investigation point out that although they by no means rule out the accuracy

of Gutierrez' observations for this reason alone, it is unlikely that money

would be passed for a sinister purpose in such an open manner as was al-

legedly observed by Gutierrez. First, it is unlikely that an agent would

be paid off right at the embassy or the consulate. Second, even if he

were, the payoff would more probably be carried out in the privacy of a

room. Nevertheless, investigation is continuing.

Unfortunately, Gutierrez' description of the automobile allegedly

driven by the Cuban, a light tan Renault, happens to be a very popular

make and color in Mexico City. A car ansvering this description was on one

occasion observed in the vicinity of the Cuban Imbassy and has been traced

down through the records of the automobile-registration division in Mexico.

The present ower cannot be ascertained, however, because the registration

of the automobile (as is common in Mexico) has been maintained under the

name of the original owner, tho orned it several years ago, in order to

avoid the payment of transfer taxes.

Efforts to trace the automobile fron

far with negative results.

2.

Statement of Gilkerto Alvarado Ugarte.

On November 26, 1963, Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte, a 23-year-old

Nicaraguan secret agent, at the time seeking to penetrate the Castro

forces in Cuba by going to Cuba from Mexico to receive guerrilla training

on the island, came to the American Embassy in Mexico City and declared

that he had witnessed Lee Harvey. Oswald receiving a payoff to kill the

President in the Cuban Embassy on September 18. Alvarado said that Oswald

was given $6,500, $5,000 as compensation and $1,500 for expenses.

Alvarado

recited that at noon on the l8th of September he went to the Cuban Consulate

to turn some passport photographs over to the Consul, Eusebio Ascue, to be

used in the fabrication of false travel documents so that he could leave

Mexico for Cuba. He sat in the waiting roam and saw a group of approximately

eight persons enter the Consulate and go into Ascue's office and noticed

that someone other than Ascue was sitting at Ascue's desk. He then asked

a Cuban Consulate employee where the bathroom was, was told, and proceeded

out of the waiting room in the given direction. While standing by the

bathroom door, he said, he saw a group of three persons conversing in a

patio a few feet away. One was a tall, thin Negro with reddish hair

The comment made on Alvarado by the CIA field man on November 26 was,

"He is young, quiet, very serious person, who speaks with conviction,

knows enough. English to understand conversation.!!

--

Alvarado vas, of course, irmediately subjected to intensive

interrogation and investigation. Apparently even before he appeared at

the Embassy on the 26th of November American intelligence knew that he

was an agent for Nicaraguan anti-Cormunist forces. American intelligence

checked back with Nicaragua and had this fact confirmed but learned that

the Nicaraguans had no knowledge of Alvarado being in Mexico at that

time, and they said that his presence there, as far as they were con-

cerned, was unauthorized. They added that they knew nothing about any

assignment of his to penetrate the Castro guerrilla training operations

in Cuba. Apparently Alvarado was doing this on his own. (Ultimately,

this part of Alvarado's story was to remain unshaken. Apparently he was

indeed on his way to Cuba and had had dealings with the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico. CIty in connection with preparation of false travel documents.

Whether he was doing this as a soldier of fortune, out of conviction for

the Castroite cause or to place himself in a position where he would later

be able to cormand a higher price from the Nicaraguan and other anti-

Cammunist intelligence agencies for his information, we do not know.)

Both the Mexican and American authorities continued to interrogate

and cross-check Alvarado's story. On November 30 the CIA was informed by

the Mexican police that Alvarado had admitted to them in writing that his

whole story about Oswald was false. He said that he had not seen Oswald

at all, and that he had not seen anybody paid money in the Cuban Embassy.

He also amitted that he never tried to telephone the American Embassy

it was on a Tuesday, September 17, rather than September 18. (Alvarado

did not know it at the time, but the l7th would make it even more

likely than the l8th. On September 17 Oswald appeared at the

Louisiana State Unemployment Carmission in New Orleans and also

cashed a check from the Texas Employment Camission at the Winn-

Dixie Store Number 1125 in New Orleans. On the basis of the poly

graph results and the qualified retractions made ky Alvarado when

he saw the results, and on the basis of discrepancies

which appeared

in his story, the CIA in Mexico City concluded that in all probability

he way lying, and that the reasons he gave to the Mexican police for

Iving were probably sincere. No further investigation of the Alvarado

incident was carried on subsequent to the foregoing.

and they were therefore dropping him. "Leopoldo" is also reported to have

said "Leon" would do anything, saying that Leon had "laughed at" the

Cubans, claiming they had "no guts." "It would be easy to kill Kennedy

after the Bay of Pigs," he allegedly told Leopoldo.

Mrs. Odio is reported to have suffered a severe pshchological

reaction at her place of employment when she first saw Lee Harvey Oswald's

picture on television after the assassination, presumably because she was

struck by the fear that her own group was somehow involved in the killing

of the President

On November 1, 1963 Lee Harvey Oswald mailed a letter to the

Cormunist Party in New York City. Among other things he mentioned that

he had attended a meeting in Dallas on October 23, 1963 of a group headed

by General Walker; investigation has led to the conclusion that this must

have been an anti-Castro meeting.

With the sole exception of Hrs. Odio — and even she is now

apparently changing her story - every member of the Dallas anti-Castro

Cuban connunity who has been questioned on Lee Harvey Oswald denies ever

having observed him or having had any contacts with him whatever prior to

the assassination.

Nor has any member of that camunity come forward to

volunteer any information as to contacts with Oswald. However, Mrs.

Odio has been checked out thoroughly through her psychiatrist and friends;

and, with one exception - a layman who speculates that she may have

subconscious tendencies to over-dramatize or exaggerate - the evidence is

unanimously favorable, both as to her character and reliability and as to

her intelligence. She is under psychiatric treatment for a disease

rare in American women but apparently common among European women, known

as "grand hysteria," the primary symptom of rhich is occasional blackouts.

According to her psychiatrist, the symptons cefinitely do not include

hallucinations. It was one of these blackouts that she had when she first

observed Oswald on television after the assassination. Moreover, some of

the details of Mrs. Odio's story, as it was first related to the FBI

after the assassination - unfortunately, in a rather brief interview -

check with what we now know about Oswald. For exple: he was described

as quiet and reticent, an impression Oswald usually gave; "Leopoldo"

later told Mrs. Odio they had checked back on him in New Orleans, which

is where Oswald in fact had come from; Leopoldo siid he was told by New

Orleans that "Leon" was "loco," a term Carlos Bringuier may very well have

used to describe him; and most importantly, of course, the name "Leon

Oswald" is so close to "Lee:Oswald" as to raise the strongest suspicions.
