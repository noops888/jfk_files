fallacy of them; that there was no one to replace GARCIA,

and he (LANDLY) had often, since that call OWERY and

wondered if

GARCIA was the right person to head PASO.

ESTRADA contended that GARCIA was the logical person for that

position since no one else could, at this time, replace him.

LANDIN recalled the very fine work GARCIA had done.

wondered if getting other PASO members to constructively

criticize J. O. GARCIA when he made such derogatory

Informant determined that Congressman WILLIAM

CLAYTON POWELL was discussed by BILL LOWERY, at which time

LOWERY said he did

not know what to believe about POWELL:

JOE LANDIN said he believed the man was an opportunist, a

bad representative for his people. He said he, at one time,

had attended an Afro-Asian Conference and pictured America.
