RE:

HOODLUM INFLUENCE IN

BANKING INSTITUTIONS

organized criminal element in Chicager obtained 1, 500

shares of stock registered to Mary Bruni representing

holdings in the Northlake Realty Company, Northlake,

Illinois. According to this source, the 1,500 shares

of

stock represented approximately $150,000 in cash.

It was

stated by this source that sometime during August, 1964,

to June, 1965, Bulger, after forging the signature of Mary

Bruni, took these stocks to the Maywood Proviso State Bank

where

he dealt with Peter/Giachini and pledged these stocks

as collateral on a $100,000 loan.

ELL

According to this source,.

Mary Bruni denies

having endorsed any stock certificates for use of Joe

Bulgeroor any individual and states further that Mrs.. Bruni

was in Italy from August, 1964, through June, 1965.

It was the opinion of this source that had these

securities been taken

to any other lending institution

Bulger could have been

unable to have received such a

large loan for them.

It was the opinion of this source

that Bulger and Peter Gianchini are close friends and

Giachindi extended the courtesy to Bulger in granting

this loan.
