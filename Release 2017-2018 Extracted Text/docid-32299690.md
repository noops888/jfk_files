For the Bureau's information, Italian authorities

do not record the arrival of an individual nor do they have

a record of the individual's departure from Italy, This

practice was abolished about eighteen months ago.

The

Italian Government does, however, require all foreigners to

exhibit their passports when they

take loaging at a hotel,

rooming house, or pensione.

Pertinent information is ex-

tracted and forwarded to the Foreigners Office in Rome, Italy. (Gl)(u)

In the case of ANNALORO, special precautions have

seen taken to Ilag his departure from Italy.

Pertinent data

concerning subject has been furnished to all sea ports anc

airports, and should subject attempt to leave Italy, this

office has arranged to be advised by expeditious means:

the Bureau is aware, the Rome Office has not received any

information from Italian police which would indicate ANNALORO.

has taken lodging at a public place in Italy since October,

1963. It can be assumed, therefore, that if subject in fact

is in Italy, he is lodging at a private residence with

friends possibly under an assumed name. (E))(v)

The Rome Office, through the Central Bureau,

Criminal Division, Italian National Police, Rome, has

alerted

all police districts to be on the lookout for subject and,

in addition, airports at Fiumicino, Rome, and Malpensa, Milan,

and sea ports in Naples and Genoa

i have also been alerted

regarding subject.

It would seem logical, therefore, that

should the Rome Office receive information that subject is

at a departure point in Italy about to depart for the U.S.,

we should permit him to depart for the U. S. where he can be

arrested on arrival rather than taking the circuitous röute of

having Italian police detain him in order that a representa-

has informed this office that should ANNALORO'S

passport be limited for return to the U.S, only, he can re-

Massi, his brother, Umberto, and Salvatore drove to Rome where they

took lodging at the Hotel Parioli.
