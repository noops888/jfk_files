Daily Summary

13/0y 385Rise

CG 6498-PC advised 4/17/63 of the following

situation regarding GIANCANA's handling of the political

situation in Chicago's 28th Ward, of which the informant

is Ward Committeenan: (W)

GIANCANA has been displeased with the informant

for some time now, since the informant was unwilling to

do certain favors for GIANCANA in the past elections.

GIANCANA also feels that the informant does not owe com-

plete allegiance to the GIANCANA organization, and for

those reasons is giving strong consideration toward or-

dering the informant to immediately relinquish his position

as Ward Committeeman. If GIANCANA so orders, the informant

will then go to Mayor DALEY and turn in his resignation (Ul)

V

CG 6498-PC advised that he is certain that AL

TOMASO, newly elected Alderman of the 28th Ward, is com-

pletely in the pocket of GIANCANA and is co-operating one

hundred percent with the organization. The middle man in

all these contacts between the GIANCANA organization and

the 28th Ward Democratic organization is JOE JAMBRONE,

The informant

for the meets were made by JAMBRONE when the informant told

GIANCANA that he did not desire to know personally where

these contacts were, so that he merely met with GIANCANA

after the meetings were set: up by JAMBRONE. 92-3171=
