NOTE FOR: Distribution

SUBJECT:

CIA'S Response on JFK Board Actions

This action is the first we have received related to

decisions of the JFK Assassination Records Review Board.

I am assigning action on this subject to the Center for the

Study of Intelligence. The Center will work with components

to determine if the CIA should ask the President to object to

i eat onto obsce o

a JFK board decision.

Components and the Center may

recommend what action, if any, the Agency should take to

appeal a JFK Board decision.

The Center is responsible for

preparing the package that will be forwarded to

the Director

(via the Executive Director and Deputy Director) for

decision.

All component recommendations will be included in

such packages so the Director can assess all relevant

positions, factors, and arguments.

The suspense dates on these actions are extremely tight.

seven days for the Director to appeal a Board decision to the

President and 30 days (including the seven) for the President

to rule on an appeal.

see the attached Lotus Note from Bob

Eatinger in OGC for

more explanation of how appeals are to be

handled with the white House.

we may

have to alter our procedures as we learn how best to

cope with this new requirement.

Stay tuned.
