LA 92-113 G

Immediate interview of these persons is not

being requested because it is not considered desirable

at this time to conduct any interviews in this case in

Chicago, Boston or other places in the United States which

might jeopardize the security and/or safety of LA 4448-C-TE

or the security of this investigation by the premature

disclosure of the fact that the Bureau is aware of ROSSELLI's

interview

Both of

Subsequent to these interviews, whether or not the TORTORAs

are cooperative, more open investigation will no doubt be

desirable and it may be possible through appropriate inferences

to prevent the conclusion being drawn by the person interviewed,

that the original source of information concerning ROSSELLI's

true name was LA 4448-C-TE or was from the California area.

Every precaution should be taken to protect LA 4448-C-TE

as the informant.

The TORTORA interviews are key interviews and

should the TORTORAs be cooperative, they will be able to

furnish information of great value

to this investigation.

Subsequent to the interviews of the TORTORAs,

it is suggested that consideration be given to the convening

of a Federal Grand Jury in Boston or Los Angeles or both

places, to which ROSSELLI's immediate relatives, former

associates and friends who are known to be aware or who

can reasonably be assumed to be aware of his dual identity

could be called. Potential witnesses in this group would

include some high ranking and other members of La Cosa Nostra

throughout the United States. It does not appear that such

witnesses would have a legitimate reason to refuse to testify

on the basis of self-incrimination and such testimony on the

part of La Cosa Nostra members would no doubt be a source

of considerable embarassment to them as members as well as to

the organization.
