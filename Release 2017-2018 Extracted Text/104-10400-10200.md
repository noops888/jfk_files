Babun and Cameron are

friendly shipping-business competitors in the Caribbean

During the course of conversation at this meeting,

After a preliminary discussion at the 3 March

meeting,

It was thought that the amount of $150,000 for

the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $5,000

expense

money, payable in acvance, was too high, and Babun felt

that this situation was..lust another attempt to swindle

patriotic Cuban exiles.

Another meeting was then held

on 5 March and ä counter-offer of $100,000 was made for

the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $2,500 for ex-

penses, payable an advance.

Cameron promised to check

with his contacts after returning from a trip to the

Caribbean.

5. During a meeting on 15 March attended by Cameron

and Babun and his associates, the following terms were

sgrced upon for the assassination of the Cuban officials:

Fidel Castro, $100,000; Raul Castro, $20,000; Ernesto

"Che" Guevara, $20,000; and $2,500 for expenses, payable

access to this area. Prior to the time in question, JTAG had

been publicized by Radio Peking as being a headquarters for

American Intelligence activity. For this reason, and because

JAG was obviously not a part of the Naval Air Station complement,

there were rumors and gossip regarding the unit and its activities.

This condition was regarded as normal under much circumstances.

Being there at that time, OSWALD could have heard such gossip;

however, there is no information to indicate, nor is there reason

to belleve, that he obtained factual knowledge regarding JTAG and

Its mision. (For your Information, an incident involving the

landing of a U-2 in a rice paddy in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan,

was reported in the prens and aroused some public interest. That

incident, however, occurred in December 1959, which was some

tIme after OSWALD had left Japan),

5.

There were no Navy personnel assigned to JTAG.

Moreover JTAG did not participate in, or transfer any of, ite

activities to a Station in Baggkok. Regarding the statement by

HOBBS that a Navy Commander was recruiting Navy Personnel

for an assignment In Bangkok, It la noted that the Navy at that

time was conducting certain air reconnaissance activity from

Atsugi uning other types of aircraft.

6. The following should be considered with respect to

your source's assertions that OSWALD's squadron was in Cubi

Point, Philippine Islande in January 1958 where It kept Its gear.

In what the source now know! to have been a hangar for a U-2

airplane; and that the squadron was back in Atsugi, Japan in

: May 1958.

The term "U-2" was not known publicly and did not

gain world wide notoriety until the 111-lated Powers mission some

two years later. Therefore, it in highly unlikely that the term

"U-2" would have meant anything to OSWALD, even 1. he had bea

It and had been able to identlly the term with any aircret a dusiVE tRUM

Point, at Atsugi or anywhere else.

7. To summarise: There la no evidence or indication that

OSWALD had any association with, or access to, the JTAG

operation or its program is Japan. This applies also to information

regarding the U-2 or its miesion. Even If OSWALD had seen

-

U-2 aircraft it Atsugi or elsewbere, thin fact would not have been

considered usual nor have constituted a ureach of secarity.

Limited public exposure of the craft itself • but not of its nomen-

clature or mission - was accepted as a necessary sisk. It is

most unlikely that OSWALD had the secessary prerequisites to

differentiate between the U-? and other aircraft engaged in

classified missions which were similarly veible at Atsugi at the

same time.

at the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD has supposedly

been taped was conducted with negative resulte. Therefore, it is assumed

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facility

for internal consumption.

2. With respect to the same question, Yurly NOSENKO was asked

if any attempt had been made by the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for propa-

ganda purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in

Minsk. NOSENKO later reviewed this statement and confirmed it.

DAY S

Source was queried on the OSWALD affair on 23 January

1964. Source reported that his own Department was involved

directly with OSWALD because OSWALD came to the USSR as a

3

tourist in 1959. He had not come to special Soviet attention in

any way until Source's Department received a report that OSWALE.

had asked to become a Soviet citizen. It was implied that Source

himself examined OSWALD's request. The KGB decided to look

into OSWALD's case to see if there was any operational interest,

which part of the KGB might have use for him and what was behind

the request. It was decided that OSWALD was of no interest

whatsoever so the KGB recommended that he merely go home to

the U.S. an a returning touriet and there go through the formalities

'with the Soviet Embassy of requesting to become a Soviet citizen.

OSWALD then made the dramatic gesture of suicide when he

received this response. He had been supposed to go on a trip

with other tourists but failed to show up for the group.

At his hotel

It was found that his key had not been turned in at the desk, so it

the room, knocked and got no answer so finally they broke the

door down and found OS WALD lying there bleeding to death, 25-

Source himmelf was not present at this phase of the operatipa

but merely read a report of it.

(2) Now worried about the possibility that OSWALD would

do this again 11 refused asylum, the Soviets decided to give him

• temporary residence permit although they had no intention of

giving him Soviet citizenship. We asked why he had been sent to

Minsk and Source replied that this was merely by chance. They

had not wanted OSWALD to stay in Moscow and Minsk was chosen

arbitrarily.

(3) Asked about Marina OSWALD, Source maid that she was not

a contirmed Communist and had been thrown out of the Komsomol

for not paying her dues. She had no higher thoughts than to live a

good life, have better dresses and such things.

She was a stupid

woman and had no interest in improving herself. "From the Soviet

point of view she already had anti-Soviet characteristics. She was

not too smart anyway and not an educated person."

(4) Finally OSWALD got tired of living in Minsk and wanted

to go back to the U.S. He had married Marina and wanted to take

her with him. The Soviets decided to let them go and used Marina's

uncle to talk to them and persuade OSWALD not to spread anti-Soviet

propaganda after his departure. The uncle pointed out that the

Soviet Government had allowed OSWALD to live here, that he had

married here and the Government was going to let his wife leave

with him, etc.

(5) Asked why the Government had allowed Marina to leave,

Source replied that this was perfectly natural. She was legall,

married and expressed the desire to leave with her husband. Under

Soviet lau there is no question but what she would be allowed to leave.

(6) The thrust of Source's account was that neither OSWALD

nor his wife had at any time been of any interest whatsoever to

soviet authorities

Soviet authorities, that there had not ever buen thought

given to recruiting either of them as agents and thal, in

fact, the Soviets were glad to get rid of tiem boli.

b. (1)

During an interview on 30 January 19id,

Source

commented that "doctors examined [OSWALD) , " and "chorc

were no indications that he sas completely a psycho. " During

an ensuing discussion of the possible involvement of the Soviet

government in the assassination of President Kennudy, Source

stated, "No matter how 1 may hate anyone, but I cannot speak

against my convictions and since l know this case I could

unhesitatingly sign off to the fact thal the Soviet Union cannot

be tied into this (assassination) in any way." He continued

that the KGB was frightened of OSWALD, and would not have

discussed such a matter with him. When the possibility of !:.

recruiting OSWALD was brought up, the decision was "absolutely

not." The only involvement permitted was to arrange for Marina

PRUSAKOV's uncle in the MVD [Col. Dya PRUSAKOV] to ask

OS WALD not to spread anti-Soviet propaganda in the US in view

of the fact that he had been allowed to stay in the USSR and was

being allowed to leave. Source commented that he was aware

that the KGB had no subseguent intcrest in OSWALD because

after the assassination of the President, Source had to make a

•complete investigation and even sent several KGB staff personnel

to Minsk to investigate on the spot, "not trusting official papers."

(2) When spealing of OSWALD's request to return to the USSR,

Source remarked that OSWALD "went to Mexico to apply for

permission to go to the USSR. Our people asked Moscow and we

said absolutely not because he is completely undesirable - there

was no interest in him whatsoever."

(3) Asked his opinion on Cuban involvement in the assassination,

Source stated that he had no information on this subject, but he did

not believe that the Cuban government was involved. He gave as

a reason that if any word of such involvement had leaked out,

Cuba would have been crushed by the US.

in the spring of 1965. Unlens the United States in-

This in not to say that the increase in defense spend-

ing is about to come to an abrupt halt or that the

rise in defense production in about to terminate.

Outstanding commitment and programs already

mndermy virtually ensure a furtber expansion of the

military entablishment. However, what in most

critical to the economy as a whole in that the rate of

increase in spending in likely to slow down consid-

erably. Even allowing for as military personnel com-

mitment in South Vietnam of a half million men,

the advance in defense pending should become

little more than a modest updrift by the summer of

1967. This implies a slippage in orders for military

equipment in the near future.

It is a bit too early to find any definitive statistics

indienting that the scolerating rate of growth in

the militury establishment is about to be reverned.

To be mure, the Delense Department recently at-

mounced a marked reduction in draft ealls, but there

is some evidence that empacity limitations at training

centent, rather than a programmed slowdown in the

armed forces buildup, was involved. Altbough mili.

tary prime contract awards dipped in August (the

latest reported figure) to the lowest level since

March, this may have been merely an adjurtment

brought about by the exceptionally high level of

contract awards in July. Almo, the sharp upswing in

Summing Up

Fitting the pieces of the defense espenditure

outlook together, in the context of the apparent

military strategy, implies further significant increases

In expenditures during the eurrent quarter, with

modest increanes therenfter through the summer of

1967. It appears that with the financing of a half mil.

lion troops in Bouth Vietnam defense expenditures

would run somewbere between $70 billion and $72

billion a year. (Buch expenditures during the third

quarter of 1966 ran at a $613 billion seasonally nd-

Jarted annual rate.) At the present rate of expanson,

the 570 billion plus level will be reached sometime

in mid-1967, indicating a virtual flattening in ex-

penditures thereafter.

Forecasts of US. military expenditures in recent

years have been notoriously off the mark and, indeed,

our expectation of a slowing in the rate of outiays

could easily go awry. Certainly, should the Vietnam

buildup be escalated beyond the 500 thouand man

level or should a erisis erupt elsewbere in the world,

the oullock would be for i seemingly open-ended

expansion in our military establishment

The more intriguing alternative, and hopefully

the more probable, in how much-could military

expenditures be eut should a truce be reached in

Vietnam sometime in 1967 followed by a US. troop

Any entimate of the extent of the reduction must

Tent upon nome judgment of the cont of the war in

personnel in the logistic and training pipelines, we

arrive at a figure of approximately $2 billion a month.

Although at a $70 billion to $72 billion level of

defense expenditures, it might be supposed that all

costs of the Vietnam war would be met out of eurrent

expenditures, a cessation of the war is most enlikely

to bring the level of defense outlays down by a full

$24 billion. In the first instance, some of the expenses

properly charged to Vietnam, such as personmel and

basic maintenance costs of the 7th Fleet, currently

stationed off Vietnam, would go on war or no war.

So would nome of the eosts of the mir force bases in

Thailand. Hence, should the war terminate and the

armed forces be reduced by nearly a million men,

defenne expenditures would probably fall back to

nomewhere between a $50 billion to $55 billion annual

mte.

The Economic Consequences of Pence

A truce and withdrawal of Amenican troops ear-

lier this year would have eome during a period of

expanding eivilian markets. Such an event would

probably have forestalled the stringency in the

money markets last summer and presumably would

have contributed to a more balanced, noninflationary

growth of the economy.

Should a truce be reached after the Vietnam

encalation has run its course and defense expendr ures

probably have involved a decline in defense spending

of only 85 billion to 810 billion. A truce reached, say.

the summer of 1967 could precipitate a drop ins

military outlays of more than $15 billion. Moreover,

the fallot in military expenditures might well be

occurring about the same time
