GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

AR

on 6/13/61 PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III:

Numbers play and sports bets have dropped by about one third

since the defeat of incumbent New Kensington, Pa., Mayor

RAYMOND GARDLOCK in the primary elections last month.

Everyone, gambling operators and players allke, seem to have

adopted a

wait and see attitude concerning the election

winner, EDWARD ZALESKI.. Some gamblers think the MANNARINOS

have already. "bought" ZALESKI, others feel certain they

will eventually "buy" him, and a small third group fears

he actually intends to suppress

gambling in New Kensington.

In the meantime, everyone is being very careful, and they

do not operate as openly as before.

The current pinball machine collection for the MANNARINO-

owned Nu Ken Novelty. Co., New Kensington, is JESSIE GULDO.

He collects once each week. His brother, first name not

known, is the collector for the cigarette machines of the

MANNARINO-ownedS &S Distributing Company, New Kensington.
