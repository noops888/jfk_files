ELENA GARRO DE RAM, OF MIGE GARRO DACHS. THOMAS Calls

her .

is a voll known figure in Mexican politien social, and

literary circles, Stems a playright and vell knoz to cany

officials of the bassy Including the then A bassador was

FRESHAN, the then Deputy Chief of Mission CLARENCE A. BOONSTRA

and many others. All of those offfetals expressed to me on

various oceasions the opinion that Miss CARRO 18 a very Interesting

person and a scintillating conversationalist, but that she has a

vivid imagination and frequently appors to be unable to distinguish

betweon truth and fiction.

"Although interesting, they all considere

her as highly unreliable as a source of inforation e cept for

MT. THOMAS who apparently placed consistent credenco in what M1ss

GARRO said.

When Miss GARRO visited this 0111ce 1n Novenber 196c0 She

claimed that she had Been LEX HARVEY OSWALD at a party Buyer

the home of RUBRN DIRAN on September 30, October 1

or October

As previoualy reported, Miss CARRO clalmed that her daughter.

who acquired this intelligence information, I feel a

responsibility for seeing it through to

o its final evaluation."

It appears,

therefore,

that Mr. THOMAS has now decided that he

and not the FBI or the Department of Justice is the one to

decide how the story given by Miss GARRO is to be evaluated.

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-

ment agency Information relating to matters within the jurisdiction

of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and evaluate, the action taken by that agency is, of course,

untenable.(a)u

Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS' judgment is

raised by item 3 of paragraph 10 of his memorandum furnished to

the Secretary of State.

Any reference to the

relationship between the head of CIA Mexico and top Mexican

officials, if true, is a very highly classified matter and any

"leak" or

revelation

an arrangement would, in view of the delicate Mexican political

situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as

to Mexican-American relations. The delicacy of the situation

has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban

allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in

Havana was acting as a CIA spy with the knowledge of the Mexican

Government. Mr. THOMAS, however, included such a highlya

classified Teference in a memorandum which he classified only

as "confidential"

, contrary to regulations relative to classification

of documents.

While this reforence relates to the activities and

operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of

primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the

Bureau's attention to consideration in evaluating Mr. THOMAS

current allegations.

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded

for use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a

Dallas which roceived i copy of referenced letter. (fU
