He said he and a group of fellow students met Oswald one afternoon

(ho does not recall the date) when they came out of the Cineclub,

which I understood to be at the Dacuela do Filosofia (I am not familiar

with the University of Merico).

llo described Oswald as "raro" and

Exa "Introvertido", a person who obviously had complexes and

problems.

Oswald was wity the group during the remainder of the afternoon and

evening and all the following day.

They paid for his meals during this

timo.

(It was of interest to me my informant said that, in addition to

rocomnizing Oswald's photograph following the assassination of Prosidont

Kennedy,

ho oasily rocalled Oswald'g name because both "Harvey" and

"Oswald" connotod rabbit to him, something I had not thought of.)

The deposition was

Since knowledge of DURAN's contact with OSWALD originally

eftort to disguise the place

where

the

photo had been taken. The photo became somewhat of an

issue when the Warren Commission decided it belonged

in the Report as part of the exhibits since it had been

shown to the OSWALDs.

The Agency finally allowed the

picture...

to appear in

the report with the background

completely blocked out and with the agreement that no

mention would be made about where it had been taken.

As far as can be determined, the Agency has never

admitted publicly that the photo was taken in Mexico,

even though there has been a great deal of speculation

to that effect by several authors and journalists.

As

a matter of fact, one of the lawyers who worked with the

Commission later leaked information(to an autor regarcin

the photo, but erroneously said it had been

taken in

front of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico by CIA StIlT,

the Agency has not revealed the

actual location, only

saying it was taken somewhere outside the U.s.

All

mention of the photo has therefore been marked to be

withheld, because of sensitive sources and methods

involved.

ALVARADO, a

Nicaraguan citizen, walked in to the U.S. Embassy in

claiming to have knowledge re Kennedy's assasination.

Mexico learned Eat AlVARADo vas an agent for the Nicaraguan)

Intelligence Service (NIS), however his story re the

assassination was separate

from his work for the NIS. After

lenginy Interrogation,

Including a polygraph,

it was

determined that ALVARADO had been fabricating a story claiming

he had seen OSWALD receive money from a Cuban

official at

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

The ALVARADO story appears

in the Warren Report but it does not reveal his identity.

order to continue to protect ALVARADO and the Nicaraguan

government from possible embarrassment all mention of

ALVARADO has been marked for non-release.

25 A list and copies of douments from the OSWALD file

been forwarded to your office for review by other (LA)

branches and possibly other Divisions.

The documents

according to which volume they belong

the 201 file (there

are 57 volumes plus many bulky atachments.)

During the review, it was necessary several times to

refer to the Warren Report and the exhibits to ascertain

exactly what was already known about the Mexican aspect of the

case. It is doubtful that the other branches will find this

necessary, but in case they do, the Warren Report is held

in the Library.
