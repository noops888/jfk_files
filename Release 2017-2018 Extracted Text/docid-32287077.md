ADMINISTRATIVE

Delay in reporting is noted, however, this case

was investigated on

a continuing basis and maintained in

a current status.

CG 7016-CTE furnished the following information:

As Bureau aware, ROSS PRIO, for years top leader

of organized crime on north side Chicago, died in Miami on

December, 1972.

Contact has been maintained with CG 7016-CTE

since death of prio to be advised of decision of leadership

as to successor to PRIO.

CTE advised January 11, 1973, that top level meet-

ing of organized crime leaders was held on January 4, 1973,

at Luxor Baths, headquarters of JOSEPH AIUPPA, who currently

is one of trio of hoodlum leaders running Chicago group

CTe advised that present were LEONARDYPATRICK, LESLIESKRUSE,

AL PILOTTO, DOMINICK'DI BELLA and DOMINICK BRANCATO, a11

upper echelon leaders in Chicago. At meeting, AIUPPA advised

that leadership had discussed successor to PRIO and at least

on tentative basis, DI BELLA had been chosen. AIUPPA gave

orders to leaders to consider DI BELLA as boss of north side

until and unless other orders are forthcoming.

AIUPPA also announced that in order to contact

him other leaders should continue to contact LARRY VRASSANO,

AIUPPA underling,

at a parking lot of Old Towne Hotel in

Cicero, or TOMMYRUSSO. RUSSO for years has been underling

Of HYULARNER, kéy hoodlum figure, but since LARNER spends

nost of his time

attending to his gambling boats in Carribean,

RUSSO has been assigned to assist AIUPPA in LARNER's absence.

AIUPPA advised that RUSSO can be contacted at

Palmettö (ph) Restaurant on northwest corner of 17th Avenue

and 22nd Street in Broadview or at "Yes It Is" Restaurant on

12th Street east of 17th Avenue, which are locations where

CTE's information regarding DI BELLA confirms

indications received from other Chicago sources and in-

formants who have advised that rumors on street on near

north side have led them to believe DI BELLA has obtained

increased authority since death of PRIO. Noted DI BELLA

is elderly former Lieutenant of PRIO for decades, long

known as one of "Three Doms," middle echelon LCN

Leaders.

CTE advised that at meeting AIUPPA indicated that JOSEPH

*DI VARCO, long considered PRIO's top underling, would have

received top consideration except that he is currently

under one year sentence for income tax evasion along with

JOSEPH ARNOLD, another leader who probably would have re-

ceived top consideration except for that fact. CTE alsc

advised that GUSJALEX, who serves more or less on lateral FLA

level with AIUPPA

, undoubtedly would have attended meeting

at Luxor Baths except for fact he left Chicago on December 22,

1972, for his other residence in Fort Lauderdale, Florida

and

continues to reside there.

CTE also advised that EDWARDVOGEL, elderly top

hoodlum, left Chicago area for remainder of winter.

was in Las Vegas with his bodyguard, NATHAN "BUTCH"YLADON

over Christmas holdiays and has now left there to spend

rest of winter with his paramour, ANN FENNER, at her resig

dence in Palm Springs, California.:

CG 9561-PC furnished the following data:

On January 19, 1973, informant advised that GUS

ALEX was recently in Chicago and a discussion came up con-

cerning the activities of the "outfit" in this city. ALEX

stated there was no gambling in the Loop area and also ad-

vised that when he was through with his present assignment,

he was again returning to Florida.

In conversation with ALEX, apparently ALEX is

called back from Florida whenever the "outfit" has a

problem with "City Hall."

City Hall that include GEORGEYDUNNE and MARSHALL KORSHAK

and a number of Aldermen, particularly on the South side of

Chicago, who have been close to ALEX for a number of years.

Informant stated that ALEX apparently is having

trouble with JOEY AIUPPA and CHARLES NICOLETTI. Both

these individuals wanted him to forget about Florida and

buy a condominium in Chicago and stay here permanently.

ALEX stated he has no intention of doing this nor does he

have any intention of assuming greater responsibilities.

He stated he has a very comfortable home in Florida and

he tried to talk the informant into buying a condominium

in the same building where he is located in Florida.

Informant stated that ALEX was critical of

AIUPPA and stated that AIUPPA. and NICOLETTI now. are the top

two men in the outfit. He stated apparently they have

divided the Chicago outfit into two factions, "Management"

and "The Blazers."

Informant understood that Management was under

the direct control of JOSEPH AIUPPA and DOMINIC DI BELLA.

The Blazers were defined as "hit men."

Named among these

by the informant were NICOLETTI as the head man in this

department, followed by the two SPILOTRO brothers, FRANKIE

SCHWEIHS and to some extent JOE LOMBARDO.

Informant stated that ALEX complained that Mana-

gement was not satisfied with the "Loop operations."

They

apparently wanted more money from their contacts and con-

nections in the downtown area. They suggested that ALEX

take a more active part in the affairs of not only the

downtown Loop but the near north side operation which

until recently has been profitable.
