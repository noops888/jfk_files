black insulation tape.

At one of its edges, 2 pluga

for an iron pipe of 3/4 inch diameter were found.

These

screw to lengths of galvanized

Iron pipe of the same diameter

and approximately 15

The pipes are located inside the

explosive charge and serve as a lodging for the detonators.

Iwo metallic rods of 7 millimeterg in diameter and 10

centimeters long extend along the longitudinal ax1s.of

the charge.

They have screws at the ends which serve

to fasten them to the spools:

Spoola-magnets - There are four of them,

and they consist

spools of approximately 3 x 2x1

Each of these plates has a bore hole

Into which the small rods used to hold the charge are
