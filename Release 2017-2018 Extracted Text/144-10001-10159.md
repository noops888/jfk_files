MI. Burke,

Attached is a request from the SScI.

I have talked to Fred Cassedy at the FBI

and he says that the Committee is looking

into the Kennedy assassination and that

the SSC provided Veciana's name.

I intend to contact Howard Liebengood

next week and will probably arrange for

the SSCI to review the document out here

at that time.
