MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM:

Stanley M. Moskowitz

Director of Congressional Affairs

SUBJECT:

Status of JFK Legislation

1. This note is to advise you of the current status

of the JFK Joint Resolutions.

2.

Since your testimony last month before the Senate

Governmental Affairs Committee, we have worked with

Senator Glenn's staff to resolve various CIA concerns with

The staff agreed

to

amend the Joint: Resolution to accommodate all of our major

The Resolution now provides that the initial

review of documents for public release will be done by the

originating agencies and that the President will have the

power to postpone the release of Executive Branch

information in congressional documents.

The Committee

marked up the resolution on 25 June and it will be taken up

by the full Senate following their Fourth of July recess.

3.

The JFK Joint Resolution was referred to four

different committees in the House.

The Government

Operations Committee has voted to

report a substitute

version.

This substitute is less

favorable than the Glenn

redraft but addresses several Administration concerns, such

as Presidential appointment to the Assassination Materials

Review Board.

The Committee did not agree to include in the

legislation the concept of initial review of assassination

records by the originating agencies or Executive branch

review of its information in congressional documents.

However, we have worked with Committee staff, who have

agreed to address CIA concerns in their report.

That report

The House Judiciary, Rules,

and Administration Committees have not yet acted on the

legislation, although the relevant Judiciary subcommittee

reported the original Stokes version to the full committee.

The House is likely to adopt the Joint Resolution as

reported out of the Government Operations Committee, but no

earlier than after the Fourth of July recess.
