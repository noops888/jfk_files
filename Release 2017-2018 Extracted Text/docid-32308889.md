to pay them for several weeks, thus incurring their wrath in the

form of a near-rebellion in approximately 1965.

The drivers

refused to work and gathered at the office of the firm to protest

this failure to pay them.

The informant continued that NATARO, who was a member of the GAMBINO

"family" of the LCN in New York, called upon several other LCN

members who were friends of his to assist him in this problem and

BILL BONANNO was hanging around NATARO at

this time, his father having been kidnapped earlier, and BIlL was

expected to assist NATARO in this difficulty.

The informant advised

advised

that he, the informant,

became accidentally involved in NATARO's

defense

also. He explained that he had arrived at the firm for

the purpose of contacting HANK (LNU), an employee of NATARO and

a hi-jacker, concerning a hi-jacking

that had been planned. HANK

was

â€¢ to provide a driver for the stolen truck in this planned hi-

jacking.

When the informant arrived, HANK told him about the

situation, explaining there was about to be an explosion between

NATARO and the drivers, and he asked the informant to help NATARO.

HANK gave the informant a gun which he placed in his waistband

and the informant joined HANK and several others in the parking

lot in front of the firm, where the crowd of dissident drivers

had gathered.

Choined HANK an

JOE NATARO came out and addressed the rebellious

drivers, speaking softly and promising a partial payment to be made

that same day and full payment within a few days.

Due partly to

NATARO's persuasion and partly to the presence of his gunner informant

drivers agreed to the settlement and went back to work.

stressed that during this very ticklish situation, BILL BONANNO

remained in the firm's offices and would not go out onto the lot

with NATARO and the others. The informant said this left a bad .

taste in the mouths of many who were there or who subsequently

of many who

heard about the incident.

In referring to HANK., the informant said he was not known at that

time to be a member of the LCN, but was very close to NATARO. He

handled hi-jacking for NATARO and, in fact, was sentenced to a

prison term in the AtlantaFederal Penitentiary for hi-jacking a

truck full of Vitalis hair oil.

While speaking of treachery on GENEVESE's part, the informant was

reminded of

an incident involving the murder of FRANK "CHEECH"

SCALISE and his brother by ALBERT ANASTASIA just before the latter's

own demise by murder.

He said "CHEECH" was selling membership to

Thr informant , dvised that GIAGGIO was the hidden owner of a bar

located on Second Avenue between 109th and 110th Streets in

Manhattan.

It is located one door off of 109th, on the west side.

of the street, next to a bakery shop.

A couple of years ago, according to the informant, there was a rash

of kidnappings in New

York City of some LCN figures for ranson.

One night during this period, the informant was sitting in GIAGGIO's

bar when GIAGGIO came running in "scared stiff."

He clained that

two men in a car had tried to kidnap him and were outside. The

informant said he took out a knife and told GIAGGIO to get one

and follow him. As the informant emerged from the bar,

two men standing by a parked car which fit the description GIAGGIO

had provided.

He asked GIAGGIO whether they. were the ones and

SlAGGlO, who was visibly nervous, replied in the negative anc

hurried

back into his bar. The informant said he learned later

that night from a witness to the attempted kidnapping that the two

men he had seen earlier actually had been the would-be kidnappers

after all. He surmised that GIAGGIO had failed to identify them

because he was afraid of a "beef." The informant said that the

GAMBINO "family,' of which GIAGGIO is a member, and the old BONANNO

"family" are referred to by members of the LUCHESE and GENEVESE

as the "Pepsi Cola mobs." He said it was actions such

as the above on GIAGGIO's part that gave the GAMBINO and BONANNO

"families" a reputation of this nature.

The informant advised that HANK (LNU), the employee of NATARO, is

responsible for many hi-jackings in and around New York. He almost

never gets directly involved, but makes the necessary arrangements.

On one occasion a few years ago, HANK arranged the hi-jacking of

a truck allegedly full of bolts

associate of HANK (not to be confused with an LCN member of the

same nickname previously identified by the informant), who took

it to a lot in Brooklyn used by the hi-jackers for exchanging

the stolen goods into a "safe". truck.

they discovered at this

point that instead of the expected cargo, the truck contained

Halloween costumes and decorations and

sole second-quatty material.

"Pepi" took the truck to one of JOHNNY ANG's "drops" located in a

garage in a small town just north of New York City where ANG

paid him $2,700.00 for the entire truckload, an amount considerably

less than expected.

"Pepi" is from the 12th Street area in New
