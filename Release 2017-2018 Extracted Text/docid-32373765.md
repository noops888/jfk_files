Periodic Activity Report

Date:

?

Presumably Dec 1963.

B. PAMELA

In addition to the regular bi-weekly schedules held on

10 and 24 November, a special schedule was held on 29 November,

as was done in the case of AMAPOLA.

Among various matters dealt with in the message transmitted

on Il November. ene. in particular, was of high interest/ This was

the repuest for a man to be chosen to handle communications in eases

ef emmereensy inasmuch as it would be mere difficult to accomplish

this as "the struggle worsens." An exhaustive report on all aspects

of counterrevolutionary groups and activities was also requested of the i

agent.

On 24 November (1963), as in the case of AMAPOLA, a special

code was set up to enable "'A- CHU (illegible) to report by cable,

directly to drops in Cuba on the situation in Puerto Rico after the

assassination of President Kennedy:

"SANTOS", the agent was who

actually

receives all messages transmitted to PAMELA was to contact

"AB--N" (illegible) and have him report on the development of any of

the following situations: (I) - if a contingent of "GUSANO" Cubans

has arrived there; (2) - if mobilization of resident "GUSANO"

Cubans is noticed; (3) if mobilization of U.S. forces is

noticed; (4) - if the Cubans who arrived and those who were there

before have "developed circulation;" (5) - if activities of

repressive organs against popular forces have increased. A special

transmission was scheduled for the following Thursday at the same

time.

As there were no adverse developments in the situation

after the President's death, this subject was not dealth with

in the special transmission made on 29 November (1963) •

C. ROBERTO

(Para 3) On 25 November the agent was asked to report

on the reaction to the assassination of President Kennedy by.

governmental, right-wing and left-wing circles. The agent was

also Haad asked to report of the status of plans of agression

against Cuba.

A.

AMAPOLA CUIS AGENT IN THE U.S.

(Para 5) Cuban authorities were obviously concerned

about reactions and possible repercussions against Cuba as a result

of President Kennedy's assassination. In the message of 24 November

a special code was set up for the agent by which he could report by

cable to Havana any unusual activities such as "YANKEE" concen-

trations

mercenary concentrations, increase in repression of

Cuban and leftist sympathizers, and any disappearance of active

counterrevolutionaries. In addition a special schedule was set up

for Wednesday, 27 November.

The purpose of this schedule was un-

doubtedly to pass special instructions to the agent in case devel-

opments arising after the assassination adversey affected Cuba.

A full report via Candi*** (probably in secret writing) was requested

on the reaction of the "GUSANOS" (Cuban exiles) and the Republicans

to Kennedy's death..

***For information on Candi and a possible idastfratim identifi-

cation of Candi, refer to the Cuban teltaps.

The taps show that

the wife (Mata Marta) of a known DGI officer, Oscar CONCEPCION

Mendoza made the following statement: Tell HAGUSTERA to tell

Oscar not to forget the Candy. This statement is decidedly non-

sequitor in the context of the conversation.
