MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT

Summary of STESCALADE - Audio Operation

Against the New China News Agency in Havara

1. In May 1959, the New China News Agency (NCNA) opened.

an office in Havana in the El Medico Building which is occupied

partly by busiess concerns and partly used fos residential apast-

ments.

Shortly thereafter, the Havana Station obtained the con-

currence o! Ambassador Bonsal and Miss Carolyn O, Stacey, an

Embassy employee, to mount an audio operation against NGNA through

the wall of the adjacent apartment in which Mies Stacey lived. In

November 1959, the FE Division seat one case officer and one TSD

technician to Harana, and the installation of a microphone and tape

recorder was completed in Miss Stacey's apartment on 29 November

1959.

2. By June 1960, it had become evident that two other rooms

occupied by NCNA possibly housed commin ion mipment aid

vera used for conierences," At that tima

FE Division

case officer, weat to Harana and explored the possibility of improving

the operation, He managed to lease an apariment directly over the

NONA office and arranged for a stay-behind agent to occupy this space.

3.

In August 1950, a team of three TSD technicians who were

in Havana on a separate SR Division operation agreed to install the.

additional eguipment required for the NCNA opezation. A second FE

Division case officer, Robert Neet, came down to Havana; and he,

together with the technicians, installed a orobe microphone and tape

recorder in the apartment obtained by

over the NCNA office.

About this time the equipment was removed from Miss Stacay'a

apartment, with the exception of the plastic probe which was laft

in the wall and plastered over.

4. As as additional security precaution to provida a safe

baven, and after consultation with the Acting Chief of Station, a key.

to an apartment in the same building leased by Mrs. Marjorie

Lennox, an Imoassy secretary, was cotained.

Mas. Lennox was

told that access to her apartment was needed for photographic

surveillance purposes.

350

The Station was then faced with the probability that time

and security would work against holding indefinitely the lease to

the apartment over NCNA sirce the owers of the building were

cancelling sub-lessors' contracts and recalling leases. It was,

therefore, decided to install transmitters and switches in order to

permit continued monitoring of the target from a distast lietening

post. Another three -man team of TSD technicians consisting of

David I, Christ (alias Carswell), Walter E. Szuminsiti (alias

Taransky) and Thornton J. Anderson falias Danbrunt) documented

as tourists had been sent to Havana to install audio equipment in the

Chinese Natioralist Embassy bejore it was due to be turned over to

the Chinese Coramunits.

This operation aborted. This team was

then sent to work on the installation of the transmittars in the apart-

ment over the NCNA office.

6. At 2100 hours on l4 Septembes, Christ, who with the

other technicians was working in the target apartment, failed to keep

= scheduled aprointment with Neet. At 0100 hours on the 15th of

September, the apartment of Mrs.

Lennox was entered into and

searched by. Cuban authorities, and she was taken inio custody. At

1540 hours' on 15 Septamoes, Neet, the stay-begind agent and his wife

wese picked up by the Cuban authorities and detained.

As of today the agent remains in the custody of the Cuban

authorities. His wife bas been released and is still in Havana. Neet

to Washington where he is being debriefed. Mrs. Lennox was

subsequently released and has also returned to Washingion where she

is being debriefed, The three TSD technicians remain in confinement

to have been maltreated.

8. According to articles in the Cuban papers the three

technicians were arrested while in the apartment over the NCNA

office and completing the installation of the eguipment. The

press article adds that the key to Mrs.. Lenno's apartment was

jound on one of the technicians who identified the apartment to

which it belonged. All Cuban press releasas have referred to tee

men by alias and.have not identified them as Government of Agency

employees. It is unclear at present what story had been agreed

upon by the technicians and station personnel to be used in the event

they were caught.

(While being interrogated with Neet, Christ

indicated that Neet was his boss, ard Neet consistently denied any-

enowledge as to why he was being held,). The sub-lease for the

apartment in which the men were caught is in the name of the stay

behind agent with the original lease being in the name of

the

FE Division Case Officer.

9. Initial inforraztion indicated that the three technicians would

be charged with espionage "'against the people of China"... Subsequent

preas releases have been unclear on this point. An atterapt by Consul

Hugh Kessler to contect the three men at 1730.hours on 17 Septembes

was unsuccessil. He was not permitted to see them but was told

they were in custody.

10.

The three technicians travelled to Cuba as tourists under

vesy light commercial cover, two of them working fe= a company in

Naw York and the third, one in Baltimore.

In each case the cover

company consists of a telephone answering service and a name on the

door. Telephone messages and mail are picked 2p periodically by au

Agency contract employes. The men were provided with this cover

as well as unbackstopped home addresses for use when entering or:

leaving Cuba as tourists since the filling out of the landing card

requires this incrmation. Subsequent to their detention the home

addresses have been partially bacostopped so that inguiries will

indicate that someone with this alias zame had lived in the apartment

house in question. Insofar as the cover companies are concerned,

efforts are being made to provide a backstop to withstand inquirias

Ion the press should the Cubans reveal this informatior. In view

of the thinness of the cover, it is uncertain whether this will succeed.

11. A cleared and vitting law firm in Naw Jock has been briefed

by Mr. I. Houston on the situation with the thought that inguiries

received by the cover company could be reierred to the firm of

lawyers from whom no comment would be obtained by the press or.

other inquirers... The law firm has been briefed on the entire situa-

tion so that they may be in a position to act if any action by them

appears desirable or feasible. It would nos appear that nuch support

of any kind car be obtained irom the law firm or the law firms in.

Cuba which are associated with them.

12. Insoíar as the families are corcerned, one of the technicians

is a bachelor presently on home leave betteen to tours in

His father, a cool in a diner in the Boston area, has been contacted

by the Cifice of Security, and he will get in touch with Security if

he receives any inquiries on this matter, Security, by the sazze

token, will keep in touch with bim as the Cubans raveal their inten-

sions and course of action.

13. The wives of the other two technicians have been toid what

has happazed and are being contacted at least once daily by ISD

stafers and their wives who have bean briefed on the situation. A

conference with the two wives was held in ISD on 19 September to go

over the whole situation and determine if there wera any personal.

problems on which the Agency could be of help.

For the time being

the wives aze telling their zeighbors that their husbaads are on a

tip.

This story will be adjusted depending on sica: course of action

the Cuban Government takes, whether the aliases remain unbroken

and whether recognizable photograpes of the individuals are released

to the press, The two wives so far have taken the bad nevis exceedizgiy
