Cregar was furnished

a copy of two 1957 investigative reports on William HYDE for lead purposes

only and was informed that William HYDE was under consideration for a

covert use by this Agency in Viet Nam in 1957 but was not used. (This

information had previously been obtained from

I/SIG).

of Lee Harvey Oswald and possibly Lee Harvey Oswald for an undetermined

period of time.

The possibility that William Avery HYDE was the father

of Ruth PAINE was previously brought to the attention of Mr. Papich

through Mr. O Weal, CI/SIG. The Security File of William HYDE contains

a copy of a 1956 FBI Investigative Report (SECURITY OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES,

on Sylvia Iudlow HOKE, aka: Mrs. John L.. HOKE, nee: Sylvia Ludlow HYDE,

OST report on Sylvia HOKE.

Avery HYDE and wife Carol HYDE were associates in the late 1920's and

later of Talbot BIELFELT, #29931, who is currently employed by this

Agency in FDD. A certain amount of information concerning William HYDE,

Carol HYDE, and other associates of HYDE and BIFFFHUT during the lattor

ago.

At that time the BIELEFELT Case was under extensive investigation.
