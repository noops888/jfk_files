LIFEAT/LIERODE, Confusion in Use of Cryptonyms

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

The Station's use of certain cryptonyms identifying technical

operations against

PBRUMEN TPELIDE in Mexico has caused confusion in

Headquarters elements responsible for sourcing and dissemination of

produced; and for supporting the entire complex of

operations itself.

The cryptonyms in question are (a) LIFEAT

(b) LIERODE (C) MKTRAP (d) LICOOL/11 and (e) PBIMPULSE.

The original

meaning of these cryptonyms is being forwarded under separate cover.

The purpose of this dispatch is to submit for Station comment

a review of the technical operational effort against PBRUMEN TPELIDE

since its inception. The objectives are (1) to complete Headquarters

records. which lack considerable detail concerning the intricacies of

the operation, (2) to urge a more precise use of cryptonyms in

reporting this activity which would benefit Headquarters personnel

responsible for monitoring and supporting these operations and (3) to

suggest a few administrative adjustments which would dispel the present

confusion mentioned in

3.

The initial effort against the target was PBIMPULSE.

It was

introduced into the target using LIFEAT assets and was

actuated from

the LIFEAT VI basehouse.

This is mentioned only to complete the recor

and does not pertain to the intent of this discussion.

speaking the initial effort begins with the activation of LIFEAT/.

LIERODE in February 1959, as indicated in HIMA 12358.

eight (8) LICOOL attempts were made during 1960-1961 against

target:

The LICOOLS were monitored fron a mobile LP. (not LIFIRE),

Basehouse ABLE and Basehouse BAKER, and the latter came to be referred

to as the LIERODE base.

The most productive operation of this sort

seems to have been LICOOL/11, activated on 9 May 1959, according to

MEXI 3884, dated 15 May 1959.

According to our records the last LICOOk

ceased functioning during late 1961. Please confirm.

4.

At that time a different technique was planned.

The following

briefly outlines the development of the operations which the Station

habitually refers to as "MKTRAP":

5 February 1962:

Request for operation received at

MKCHARITY by Harvey C. MULFORD.

8 Feb.-Mar. 1962: Design and construction of MKTRAP.

9 March 1962 : MKTRAP delivered to LIFEAT CO for

placement in target area.

10 March 1962: MKTRAP installed by LIFEAT assets and

initial LP tests performed from LIFEAT VI basehouse

with negative results.

14 March 1962

IP tests conducted with revised series

line connections with positive results.

6-13 April 1962: Design and construction of LP equipnent.

16 April 1962 : Installaction of LP equipment in

LIFEAT VI basehouse.

Basehouse CHARLIE.

The photo surveillance of PRUMEN TPELIDE was put into effect,

using basehouse BAKER (LIERODE Base) at the sane time that NKTRAP was

actuated.

This photo coverage, the basehouse, PBRUMEN TPELIDE and the

activity for which the cryptonym was first authorized have all been

identified as LIERODE which has created considerable confusion here

Headquarters.

According to scanty Headquarter's records the following

operations have utilized these bases against the target:

a. PIMPULSE

LIFEAT VI

b. LICOOLS

Basehouses ABLE and BAKER

C. LIFEAT/LIERODE

d. "MKTRAD"

LIFEAT VI

LIFEAT VI, Basehouse

BAKER, Basehouse CHARLIE

e. PHOTO

Basehouse BAKER

Headquarters has the impression that the principal factors that

contributed to the suspension of MKTRAP activity

from LIFEAT VI,

HEre

the physical deterioration of the house itself and the divorce

of the

basehouse keepers.

The current LIFEAT Project Oytline indicates that

LIFEUD 14 and LIFEUD 17 were obtaining a divorce and were terminated

as of 30 September 1962. Headquarters assumes they were the occupants

of LIFEAT VI, yet the project outline does not show that the base was

closed. LIFEAT VI was listed on page 20 of the outline

as

an active

unit.

On the other hand, page 15 of the outline states that LIFEUD 22

and LIFEUD 23 are occupying the "LIERODE photo basehouse",

but that

they have never been involved in LIFEAT work.

This indicates that

LIFEAT/LIERODE and the photo work against the PBRUMEN target are now

being conducted from two different basehouses.

The project outline

also indicates that while it had been planned to have this base serve

technical difficulties made this impossible,

therefore these

two agents were not being included under LIFEAT

When MKTRAP was re-actuated in November 1963 and as stated

the Station utilized another LIFEAT basehouse,

also called

basehouse CHARLIE, situated approximately six miles from target.

Please confirn the accuracy of the foregoing and supplement it

informing Headquarters the basehouses and keepers involved and the

operations they are currently monitoring.

Headquarters requests Station's comments on the following

suggestions:

Photographic coverage.

That a separate project be

prepared to include LIFEUD 22 and 23.

The project should

cover their salaries, basehouse rent, and equipment

expenses, an arrangement similar to LITABBY and LIDOGTROT.

This activity, identified with a new cryptonym would

eliminate further confusion when discussing photographic

coverage of PBRUMEN TPELIDE.

LICOOL.

Headquarters is not aware of any LICOOLs

presently operative.

If any are contemplated, CSI-52-6,

February 1958, requires special Headquarters approval prior

to any action taken. If successful, a decision can be made

at that time whether a new project is necessary or whether

it can adequately be covered under LIFEAT,

the assets being utilized in the operation.

LIERODE.

The original intent of this cryptonym is

discussed in the separate

cover attachment and the activity

has been assigned file number 50-6-32/6.

If the operation

utilizes LIFEAT assets,

it is suggested that it remain

under LIFEAT Project and be identified as LIFEAT/LIERODE in

all correspondence.

Please inform Headquarters of the assets

presently used for LIFEAT/LIERODE coverage.

MKTRAP. KURIOT would prefer the Station not use this

cryptonym in reporting this particular type of coverage.

is suggested that a new cryptonym, in the LI series, be

utilized to reference this activity.

The present cryptonym

refers to a technique which hasprogressed from the

developmental into the operational stage and should more

appropriately be identified with & regular station cryptonym.

If this operation is being worked by LIFEAT assets,

it might be identified with a dual cryptonym LIFEAT/LI.. A

separate file number, within the LIFEAT series, can be

assigned to cover "MKTRAP" if the Station requests it, but

it does not seem necessary since other LIFEAT targets do not

have separate file numbers eitber.

Consolidated Project.

If the Station prefers, all

technical operations - LIERODE,

MKTRAP, LICOOL, PHOTO -

directed against PBRUMEN TPELIDE can be funded and

administered under one project.
