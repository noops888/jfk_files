House Select Committee on Assassinations

Nosenko

Ken Klein, Committee Senior Counsel, has begun his review

of the 1968 DDO and 1968 OS studies of Nosenko's bona fides. He

should complete his first reading of the studies this week and may

wish to talk to the authors of the studies. Annex A of the OS

study was removed by the DDO/CI Staff which claims highly sensitive

viable sources are identified in the Annex. This was accepted by

Staff Director G. Robert Blakey, how√©ver, he indicated he will

request access if he considers an asset relevant to his inquiry.

He understands he will have to show clearly that this information

is relevant

Patricia McMillan

Patricia McMillan was an American author who talked to

Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow. She has subsequently written an

authorized biography of Marina Oswald. Committee Staffers have

reviewed her 201 file which discusses her contacts with Domestic

Contact Division in the 1960's and contains HTLINGUAL mail intercepts

of her correspondence while in Moscow. In April she will testify

in executive session. For that session, the Committee wants certain

classified documents from her 201 file made available as evidence. We

are developing a procedure with OGC to meet this request and still not

expose our documents to either potential disclosure by other Members of

Congress (by virtue of House Rule XI) or citation in the official transcript.
