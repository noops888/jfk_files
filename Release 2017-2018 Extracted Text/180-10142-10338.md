HELSINKI

Robert S. Anson, author of "They"ve Killed the

President! The Search for the Murderers of John F. Kennedy,"

offered a critical appraisal of Lee Harvey Oswald's travel

through Western Europe prior to his appearance in Moscow

on October

16, 1959. Anson expressed particular concern

over the issuance of a Soviet tourist visa in Helsinki,

Finland to Oswald prior to his entry into the Soviet Union.

Anson wrote that. "Lo In Monday, October 12, Oswald went

to the

Soviet Consulate and applied for a visa. It was

granted two days later." (Anson, p. 159)/ Anson concluded:

Oswald also managed to secure a Soviet

visa in record time.

The CIA told the

Commission that under ordinary circum-

stances obtaining a visa in Finland

took one or two weeks; Oswald got his

in two days. (Ibia., p. 160)*

* Anson was referring to the Warren Commission Report where it

is stated:

The Department of State has advised the Commission

that it has some information that in 1959 it usually

took an American tourist in Helsinki 1 to 2 weeks to

obtain a visa, and that it has other information that

the normal waiting period during the past 5 years has

been a week

or less.

According to the Department's

information, the waiting period has always varied fre-

quently and widely, with one confirmed instance in: 1963

of a visa routinely issued in less than 24 hours.

Thus, the issue has arisen whether oswald's receipt

of a Soviet visa prior to his entry into the Soviet Union

was an

"odd happening" as Anson characterized it; circum-

stantial evidence tending to show that Oswald had received

special assistance in order to enter the Soviet Union.

# During the course of its investigation the Warren Commission

shared Anson's concerns. In a letter to the CIA dated May

25, 1964 J. Lee Rankin inquired about the apparent speed

with which Oswald's Soviet visa was issued. Rankin noted

that he had recently spoken with Abraham Chayes of the

: that visas during the 1964 tourist season were being granted

This information from the Department of State and the Central

Intelligence Agency thus suggests that Oswald's wait for a

The prompt issuance of Oswald's

visa may have been merely the result of normal procedures,

due in part to the fact that the summer rush had ended.

It might also mean that Oswald was unusually urgent in his

demands that his visa be issued promptly.

Oswald himself

said nothing to the Soviets about defecting until he arrived

in Moscow.

The second

Dispatch dated October 9, 1959, one

day prior to Oswald's arrival in Helsinki, illustrates

that Golub did have the authority to issue visas without

delay. The Dispatch discusses telephone contact between

Golub and his Consular counterpart at the American Embassy

in Helsinki. In part the Dispatch discloses:

...Since that evening (September 4, 1959)

Golub has only phoned (the US consul) once

and this was on a business matter.

Two

Americans were in the Soviet Consulate at

the time and were applying for Soviet visas

They had previously

warrant the belief that Oswald's travel into the Soviet

Union was assisted by others, particularly the Soviets:

However, the possibility of assistance cannot be dismissed

due to Golub's probable connection with the KGB and the

lack of other substantive information affable to definitely

confirm that Oswald's visa was handled in a manner similar

to that of the two American students who had entered the

Soviet Union with Golub's assistance via Finland.
