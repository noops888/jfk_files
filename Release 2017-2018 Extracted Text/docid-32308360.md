tiorin,

There is attached for your information a copy of a

letter, together with the enclosure thereto, from the Director,

Office of Munitions Control, dated March 5, 1969 and addressed

to Mr. John H. Davitt, of this Division.

the attached material reflects that the Government of Mexico

would not accede to the request of the State Department to make

available expert witnesses to testify in the captioned matter,

and that the state Department considers the case closed.

It is our opinion that the testimony of Mexican police

officials would be essential to a successful prosecution in this

matter.

Accordingly, we do not contemplate prosecution, and

we are not requesting any further investigation in this matter.
