The Attorney General

NOTE:

The Attorney General, on 8/8/75, and the Deputy

Attorney General, met with Associate Director Nicholas P. Callahan,

Assistant Director V/. Raymond Wannall, and Inspector John B. Hotis

to discuss the request of the Senate Select Committee for the identities

of sources utilized to elfect Cointelpro activities. The Attorney Ceneral

indicated prior to discussing this problem, which relates to the over-

all confidentiality of FBI sources, with zenator Church, Chairman of

the committee, he desired to be furnished intormation which would

enable him to insure himself there were no Cointelpro activities of a

scandalous or infamous nature which at a later date could cause em-

barrassment to the Department. The attached memorandum was

prepared during the period 8/8-12/75 by personnel of the Internal

Security Branch of the Intelligence Division. It represents a careful

review of all Cointelpro actions where results were known. It is

pointed out in the majority of authorized Cointelpro actions results

were not recorded. Also, because of the wide variety of Cointelpro

actions, results in many areas are not subject to measurement.

For

exarple, there is no way of determining how many individuals left the

Communist Party as a result of our documented mailings relating to

Soviet anti-semitisn

On June 9, 1969, an Informant advised that Michael

Baynham, a Detroit Black Panther Party (BPS) member, disappeared

from Detrolt June 6, 1969, after taking $150 of BPP funds. He

allegedly purchased

a gun with part of this money and left Detroit.

The BPP was reportedly very upset ovex Baynham's actions.

was found fatally shot that date in the hallway of Jackle Spleer's

Spicer was present

at the time of the shooting and advised police he had committed

suicide.

The Wayne County, Michigan Medical Exaniner's Office

subsequently advised Baynhan's death could possibly have been a

suicide.

On September 15, 1969, FBI Headquarters authorized Detroit

Office to mall an anonymous comunication to a "representative nus-

who it was belleved comittad suicide and would raise the question

• of possible responsibility on the part of national BPP leaders for

the suicide. The letter mould also be prepared in a manner to

cause suspicion that Jackle Spicer, a BPP leader in Detroit, was

the author of the letter and thus cause disruption in the BPP.

On September 19, 1969, an informant advised the receipt

Spicer and Anita Hartnan (also BPP "embet) wrote the letter.

As a

Meyers was told to stay away from Spicer aince she was probably a

police informant and the letter had come fron the police through her.

At a BPP meeting held September 18, 1959, a decision was

In Februarys 1971, the Scattle Oxfice advised that the

collowing action was

to discredit Michael Thonas Justesen

and Clayton Vin Lydegtai anong their tollow New Leit issociates.

During Decenber, 1970, in connection with the "Seattle 3" trial,

it wus aprarent that the deiendants and their attorneys were

under the impression that the Goverament intended to uncover

other intornants in addition to the one wto was surfuced lor

testimony, (the "featile d" is i hane coined by news tedia to

describe eight persons ladicted by a Federal Grand Jury at

seattle, Washiastou, on April 16, 1970, for violation

ol the anti-riot law and conspiracy to destroy Goverument

property.)

Although there was general speculation that one

of the defendants wus a Governeat inforwant, this was not

true. The Govermient had no other intormants to uncover.

Following tue declaration oi i mistrial in the case, an

anonymous call was nace to Defense Counsel Jedixey Steinborn.

(The mistrial was declared as a result oi actions by a delendant

who was cited for contempt.)

ihe anonymous caller altered to

help stelaborn in defense oi the case but related a fear that

steinborn's phone might be bugzed.

steinbora was instructed to

proceed to a particular pay telephone booth directly across

iron the Seattlo Police Department. lo was observed catering

the phone booth and the call was pincod to hit.

steinbore was

adviscd that he was then under observation by the caller whici

leit the inpression that the call emnated iron the Seattle

POlicE Departnent.

The caller disclosed an intention to get

even with united States Attorney Stan Pitkin of Seattle, and the

FBI for what they did to the Seattle Police Department.

(It is

noted that Pitkin handled the Go erneat's case concerniny the

"Seattlo 3," and also received considerable publicity la 1970

in connection with an extose oi police corruption besure the

Icderal Gruad Jury.) Tho ¿nonyuous caller advisca hii, chat

Aichael Justesen and Clayton Van Lyde¿zai were fUl informants.

(Justeson was in fugitive status at the time and Van Lydegral's

Whereabouts were not kaown.) In reallty neither was an iniormant.

United States Attorney Pitkin was not aware of the above action.

As a result, Steinborn contronted Istkin # few wonths

later and warned that disclosure durin; any tuture trial that oac

of the decendants was actually an rut intoriaut would jeopardize the

Goverment's case. Titlia denied any knowledge that the VBI might

have

an undisclosed informant within the "Seattle 8." Information

Iron other sources indicated that some persons sympathetic with

the "Seattle 8" felt that Justesen was an informant.

This gave

advising them the Global Books Forum was sponsoring a lecture with

Harvey O'Connor as the featured speaker to be held October 21, 1960,

at Wayne State University, Detrolt, Michigan. They were asked

whether the newspapers could comment in view of their interest and

Wayne State University's policy of not allowing communist organiza-

tions the use of any of its campus buildings. They all replied they

had no knowledge of this situation, whereupon the telephone calls

were immediately terminated.

shortly after the placing of the anonymous telephone

calls, Mr. Homer Strong, Director of McGregor Conference Center,

Wayne State University, and Director of Alumni Relations, Wayne State

University, telephonically contacted the Detroit Office. He advised the

University had been approached by the "Detrolt Times" newspaper and

asked if the scheduled lecture for October 21, 1960, was a communist

meeting. Mr. Strong pointed out that a check of "Who's Who in America"

determined that Harvey O'Connor was listed as an author and to have

been connected with a number of "anti-organizatlong" and "civil rights

groups."

The speech appearance was cancelled by officers of

Wayne State University. The cancellation caused consternation

amongst the Communist Party (CP), which was sponsoring the mesting,

and Helen Winter, CP Headquarters, sought an injunction. Wayne Cir-

cuit Judge George E. Bowles granted the injunction and ordered Wayne

State University to permit the meeting. The meeting was held

October 21, 1960, at Wayne State Unlversity and about 100 persons

attended.

Helen Winter, supra, subsequently quit her job at the

Weldwire Company, 3341 Puritan, Detrolt, Michigan, reportedly

because the adverse newspaper publielty was too much for her and

leaders to be of questionable character and living in luxury through the

displayed concern and attempted to rebut the program at each opening meeting

do with communists for the past five years. When asked what prompted his

visit at this time, he stated that Oliver Brooks, Vice President of the

University Cirele Development Foundation, had requested his resignation

effective October 1, 1964. Cooperman added the reason given by Brooks

was that it had come to their attention that Cooperman, in the past, had

used an assumed name. Cooperman admitted to Brooks that this was so and

Brooks then went on to explain that the Foundation, which was attempting

to raise a large sum of money, could not risk unfavorable publicity as the

Mr. Seidel:

SA Petersen:

How long have you been in

the Bureau?

Twenty-four_ years as of

June 25, 1975.

Where have you been assigned?

In Boston, Baltimore, New

York, Tampa, and San

Diego.

The Bureau has indicated that

you were a coordinator of the

COINTELPRO in San Diego. As

such, what were your duties?

The duties for the most part

consisted of preparing letters

to the Bureau asking for

authority to take some specific

action in the program; awaiting

the reply from the Bureau; and

then, if any action was taken,

to advise the Bureau of the

results of such action. It

is noted that many of the re-

quests to take specific action

were turned down by the Bureau.

Were you the focal point of

the program?

Yes, in the sense that any

Idea for action to be taken

in the program was trans-

mitted to the Bureau for

approval by me and if approval

was received, it would be re-

lated to whomever had suggested

the activity.

I would then

report any results to the Bureau.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Formerly Known As

Black Panther Party for Self-Defense

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby

George seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing

black people

to take control of the life, politics and destiny

of the black community.

The Party, operating the Black Panther

Intercommunal News

Service, publishes a newspaper called

"The Black Panther," which

use oi guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program

to end the oppression of the black people but since early

1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercommunal

Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the

U. S. Government by force and

violence until 1971, leaders

have since avoided extreme statements in favor of

calling

for action within the established order. Newton, in an

interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"

magazine, stated the Panthers"

chief

ambition is to change

Che American Government by any means necessary but that

ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,

indicators, of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.

Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been

arrested in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,

murder

of a 17-year-old female

and the pistol whipping of

Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges

and is now a local fugitive.

Additionally, one died and

three were wounded

as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

was chartered by the State of California as

a non-profit corporation in sepeles, calitornath offices

corporation alleges that "US" is primarily an Afro-

American cultural organization.

During the spring of 1968, however, a source

advised that MAULANA RON KARENGA, true name RONIE MC KINLEY

EVERETT, Founder-Chairman of "uS"

published a booklet

entitled

( "The Quotable Karenga"

, in which he talked of

revolution, black power, and condemned Christianity for the

plight of the black man.

In this booklet, KARENGA stated "

... You must have

a cultural revolution before the violent revolution.

cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.

... The revolution being fought now is a revolution to win

the minds of our people. If we fail to win this, we cannot

wage the violent one. ...When the word is given, we'll

see how tough you are. When it's 'burn', let's see how much

blow up. And when it's 'take that white girl's head

too', we'll see how tough you are..."

The above source advised that "US" members are

required to study and memorize this booklet. "US" members

are also assigned Swahili names which they use in lieu

of their given names.

A second source advised that KARENGA had

spoken at various meetings in Los Angeles at which time he

talked of creating an "US" army of 1,000 men, obtaining

weapons and ammunition, guerrilla warfare tactics, and

revolution. KARENGA also stated "The only way to

get

life is to take a life and as we get stronger, we will

take what we want from the white man's United States."

He also

stated that if the police killed any "US" members,

the "US" organization would kill some of them. '

APPENDIX CONTINUED

The first source above advised that KARENGA

also stated that race riots throughout the country

were not riots but were actually revolts or revolutions

and that the black people were going to win their

freedom by violence, if necessary.

A third source advised that KARENGA stated

that a revolution would take place in the future and

that no one can believe in black revolution without

believing in armed conflict because the two go hand in hand.

A fourth source advised in August, 1974, that the

US Organization has been evicted from its headquarters at

4302 souin Crenshaw Boulevara, Los Angeles, and because

of lack of funds,

has been unable to locate a new meeting

place.

The organization has terminated all public meetings.

NATION OF ISLAM (NOI)

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION

EXTREMIST MATTER

The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a black nationwife

organization headquartered at Muhammad's Temple #2, 7351

South stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Elijah

Muhammad, self-styled "Messenger of- Allah" and divinely

appointed leader of the black race in America, was leader

of the NOI until his death on February 25, 1975, at which

time his son, Wallace D. Muhammad, became

Supreme Minister

of the NOI.

The NOI seeks a separate black nation, espouses

its own version of the Islamic Religion, and has considered

all "whites" to be devils; however, Wallace D. Muhammad

in an interview published in "Muhammad Speaks"

, March 21, 1975,

same being a weekly and the official NOI newspaper, stated

there would no longer be stress put on the white people's

status as

, "devils"; that whites have "begun to reform"

and

"The past

is the past until it is dug up. We will not

dig it up." NOI official policy instructs members to obey

laws of the United States that do not conflict with NOI

laws; to defend Nol officials, property, women, and

them-

selves at all costs, if attacked; and to disarm any

attacker and use the attacker's weapon against him.

The NOI body is broken down into: 1) the Fruit of

Islam (FOI),

an all male military-type group, to which

instruction in judo and karate is given, and

which has as

its mmission security of officials, membership, and property

of the NOI, and enforcing discipline in the NOI; and 2)

the Muslim Girls Training (MGT), an all female quasi

military-type group which has as its mission homemaking and

child guidance in accordance with NOI teachings.

NOI activity is widespread among black inmates in

many prisons in the United States.

In recent years internal

dissidence and difficulties with

rival. Muslim groups and

other adversaries have produced considerable violence, some

involving physical confrontations and acts of violence with

law enforcement agencies.

Seidel:

Wirick:

You understand that this is an informal Interview

and is in connection with the Bureau's COINTELPRO

as it relates to the FBI investigation of the BPP?

Yes, but for what purpose is the Senate conducting

this survey?

To aid in formation of new legislation so that the

FBI and other Government agencies will have more

definite guidelines to follow.

I believe the Congress already through lack of

information, isolated instances and some hysteri

nas enacted too many restrictive laws that preveni

the FBI and other Government agencies from protecting

the law abiding element of our society from the

"bad guys".

(He was in general

agreement) Did you handle the

COINTELPRO from 1970 through March, 1971?

Yes, but I believe the Bee ceased to function locally

about November or December, 1970. As I recall my

function was to write a progress type letter regarding

progress which described the illegal activities of

members of the BPP and to report that this incormation

had been furnished local police agencies but information

generally emanated from confidential informants.

I recall, date unknown, information was received

regarding Kenny Denmon (Kenneth Lee Denmon), one time

head of the local BPP, that he was using stolen credit

cards.

Information was received that Walter Wallace

(Walter Carl Wallace, Jr.) was on narcotics and that

he and his wife,

Velma, were

stealing to get money

for narcotics and that Velma's mother was also involved

in local thefts.

All above information was furnished local law agencies

and local arrests were made.

Furnishing the

above type of information is a function and responsibility

of the FBI.

The BPP in San Diego was very effective in causing

their own problems and their own extinction and their

criminal activities were not restricted to the examples

I've given.

Did the COINTELPRO try to disrupt the BPP Breakfast

Program?

No, not to my knowledge. I recall that soon after

the Breakfast Program was started that other members

of the BPP accused Ken Denmon of stealing money from

contributions made to the frogram.

Seidel:

On second thought I believe we did disrupt the BPP

Breakfast Program in that we received complaints

from several dairys and bread companies, et cetera,

that they had been approached by Bee members with

veiled threats of extortion if they did not donate

quantities of food, et cetera, to the BPP Breakfast

Program.

The FBI and local police investigated and

I believe as a result their practices were discontinued,

but the investigation failed to establish a prosecutable

offense of extortion.

Did you have any connection with distribution of

"cartoons" depicting BPP members as compromising each

other, et cetera?

No, but I have seen "cartoons" in the BPP newspaper.

Have you ever seen

or read copies of the BPP newspaper?

No

Did the COINTELPRO promote dissention between the BPP

Not to my knowledge.

As I recall there was never

any need to.

They were constantly at odds with each

a san Diego BPI

member was killed by an US Group member and John Savage,

another local BPP member was killed by an US Group

member.

In Los Angeles two other BPP members, names not

"US" was chartered by the

• State of California as

a non-profit corporation in September, 1966, with offices

at 0211 South Broadway, Los Angeles, California. The

corporation alleges that "US" is

primarily an Afro-

American cultural organization.

During the spring of 1968, however, a source

advised that MAULANA RON KARENGA, true name RONIE MC KINDEY

EVERETT, Founder-Chairman of "US"

An OF NOSA

, published a booklet

entitled "The Quotable Karenga", in which he talked of

revolution, black power, and condemned Christianity for the

plight of the black man.

In this booklet, KARENGA stated "...You must have

a cultural revolution before the violent revolution.

The

cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.

... The revolution being fought now

is a revolution to win

the minds of our people. If we fail to win this, we

cannot

wage the violent one.

...When the word is given, we'll

see how tough you are. When it's

'burn', let's

see how much

you blow up.

And when it's 'take that white girl's head

too', we'll see how tough you are..."

The above source advised that "US" members are

required to study and memorize this booklet. "US" members

are also assigned Swahili names which they use in lieu

of their given names.

A second source advised that KARENGA had

spoken at various meetings in Los Angeles at which time he

talked of creating an "US" army of 1,000 men, obtaining

weapons and ammunition, guerrilla warfare tactics, and

revolution. KARENGA also stated "The only way to

get

life is to take a life and as we get

stronger, we will

take what we want from the white man's United States."

He also stated that if the police killed any "US" members,

the "us" organization would kill some of them.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker was a supervisor

with the San

Diego Office of the FBI from sometime in 1968

through April, 1971.

Mr. Baker advised that he was a supervisor of the

security squad but could not recall if the dates mentioned

by Mr. Seidel were correct.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker

supervised the COINTELPRO.

Mr. Baker advised that he did supervise this pro-

gram which was initiated by FBI Headquarters and not on the

field office level. He stated that as he recalled, a letter

vas submitted either monthly, quarterly or semi-annually.

The letter was submitted by

a Special Agent whose case loa

was such that he could take the time to prepare the letter.

Mr. Baker replied that this was not true but

that Special Agent Burns had been assigned the COINTELPRO

handle the program.

Mr. Seidel inquired whether Special Agent Roy

disciplinary reasons.

stated that he could not recall any award being given as a

result of COINTELPRO activity.

ROBERY S. BAKER BE SO STA GENER

Mr. Seidel asked what Mr. Baker's definition of

the COINTELPRO was.

Mr. Baker replied that the COINTELPRO was a

disruptive type program.

Mr. Seidel stated that the FBI had apparently

written a letter regarding a white girl friend of Kenneth

Denman, a BPP leader in San Diego. He inquired as to why

this letter was written.

Mr. Baker stated that Denman was considered one

of the stronger leaders of the San Diego Branch of the BPP,

and if it was possible to keep him from becoming a strong

leader, it would be disruptive to the party.

The fact that

Denman

was living with a white girl was considered derogatory

toward him by BPP members in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether such activity.

would have been taken against a leader in an organization

such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

(see description) if the leader of such a group had been

living with a white woman.

Would such a letter be appropriate?

Mr. Baker replied that he did not feel that such a

letter would be appropriate in this case because this organi-

zation involved

religious leader and our program was not

Jirected at religious groups but was directed toward black

nilitant and extremist groups.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker recalled

individuals in the BPP named Tate, Wallace, Denman and Bell.

Seidel then mentioned an incident wherein the

San Diego Office of the FBI had furnished information to the

Los Angeles Office of the FBI for transmission to local auth-

orities concerning a group of BPP members from San Diego who

were traveling to Los Angeles to attend a funeral.

Mr. Baker stated that he could recall that such an

incident occurred and that information was furnished stating

that BPP members from San Diego would be carrying concealed

weapons.

He said he thought the furnishing of this information

resulted in some of the BPP members being arrested in Los

Angeles.

Mr. Seidel Inquired as to whether Mr. Baker could

recall someone from the FBI in San Diego visiting the mother

of a girl who was an alleged member of the BPP in San Diego,

and whether the FBI went to the mother to put pressure on

another member of the family.

Baker stated that he vaguely recalled such a

case but could not recall the details and could not be

certain this had occurred.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether the FBI had any

technical surveillances on the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel then asked why such techniques were

not used in San Diego if they were used in San Francisco.

Mr. Baker replied that such techniques were not

needed in San Diego due to the good source coverage of

party activity.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether there was a

conflict between US, Incorporated, and the BPP in San

Diego.

Mr. Baker replied that US, Incorporated, head-

quarters were in Los Angeles.

There was a power struggle

between the two groups for membership of blacks and much

"Ron Karenga is impotent" which were printed

Mr. Seidel then stated that these cartoons were

Mr. Baker stated that he did not recall.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that US, Incorporated,

and the BPP were led by and made up of people with extensive

criminal records,

and because of this and their general

demeanor, the FBI did not really have to provoke or dis-

rupt them because they kept themselves in a constant state

of turmoil.

He stated that Special Agents connected with

cause of heavy case loads of other matters and

the GOINTELPRO did not devote much time to the because they

assisted in working criminal matters such as bank robberies

and other criminal violations.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that a great deal of

time was spent by the Special Agents working with their

sources because they had to be extremely careful that they

were protected. If a crime was planned and a source had

knowledge of it, the source would try to keep the crime from

being committed. If it was not possible to prevent the crime,

the source might be forced to participate, and if arrested, a

problem would be created in attempting to get the source out

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

Title 50, U. S. Code, Section 781 (Internal Security

Act of 1950) stated that, as a result of evidence adduced

before various committees of the Senate and House of Representa

tives, Congress found the existence of a world communist

revolutionary movement, whose purpose is to establish a

communist totalitarian dictatorship in the world's countries

through the medium of a worldwide communist organization.

Communist action organizations in various countries endeavor

to carry out the objectives of the world communist movement

by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments by

any means.

The communist organization in the United States -

the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) - pursuing its stated objectives,

presents "a clear and present danger to the security of the

United States." The Subversive Activities Control Board,

established by Section 791 of the above Act, found

the CPUSA

to be a communist action organization.

This finding was

upheld by the United States Supreme Court in June, 1961. The

CPUSA has continued to be an arm of the international communist

movement dominated by the Soviet Union. The CPUSA, in its

dependence on the soviet Union, has never knowingly adopted a

position contrary to soviet policy.

Its leaders frequently

confer with Soviet leaders to receive guidance and direction

on the policies the CPUSA is to follow. There has been no

evidence that the primary aims of the

CrUSA, as they conform

to soviet objectives, have changed over the

years.

NATION OF ISLAM (NOI)

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION

EXTREMIST MATTER

The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a black nationwife

organization headquartered at Muhammad's Temple #2, 7351

South Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.

Elijah

self-styled "Messenger of Allah" and divinely

Munounted leader of the black race in America, was leader

of the Nor until his death on February 25, 1975, at which

time his son, Wallace D. Muhammad, became

Supreme Minister

of the Nol.

The NOI seeks a separate black nation, espouses

Its own version oi the Islamic Religion, and has considered

all "whites" to be devils; however;

Wallace D. Muhammad

in an interview published in "Muhammad Speaks"

, March 21, 1975,

same being a weekly and the official NOI newspaper, stated.

there would no longer be stress put on the white people's

status as "devils";

that whites have "begun to reform" and

"The past is the past until it is dug up.

We will not

dig it up."

NOI official policy instructs members to obey

laws of the United States that do not conflict with NoI

laws; to defend NOI officials, property, women, ana them-

selves at all costs, if attacked; and to disarm any

attacker and use the attacker's

weapon against him.

The 'NOI body is broken down into: 1) the Fruit of

Islam (FOI), an all male military-type group, to which

instruction in judo and karate is given, and

its mmission security of officials, membership, and property

of the NOI, and enforcing discipline in the NOI: and 2)

the Muslim Girls Training (MGT), an all female quasi

military-type group which has as its mission homemaking and

child guidance in accordance with NOI teachings.

NOI activity is widespread among black inmates in

many prisons in the United States.

In recent years internal

APPENDIX

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY

The socialist Workers Party (SWP) is a revolutionary,

Trotskyist.communist organization, which is headquartered in

New York City. Its purpose, as stated in its Declaration of

Principles, is the overthrow of the U.S. Government and the

institution of a dictatorship of the working class and the

eventual achievement of a communist society.

It was founded

in 1938

and maintains close association with international

Trotskyist organizations as a "sympathizing" group, but it

denies formal membership in any foreign group to escape

application of the Voorhis Act, which regulates certain

types oi organizations subject

to foreign control.

the SWP does

not openly advocate the use of violence at the

present time

to overthrow the U.S. Government, it believes

that eventual violent revolution in the U.s. is inevitable.

Its objection

to the current use of violence is based on the

ground that it believes violence is premature at this time.

The SWP seeks

to precipitate a revolution when conditions

are ripe and to seize control of the revolution and to direct

it when it occurs.

"US"

Also Known As

"US"

• Incorporated

"US" was chartered by the State of California as

a

non-profit corporation in september; 1966, with offices

at o211 south Broadway, Los Angeles,

California.

The

corporation alleges that "US" is primarily an Afro-

American cultural organization.

During the spring of 1968, however, a source

published a booklet

revolution, black power, and condemned Christianity for the

plight of the black man.

In this booklet, KARENGA stated "... You must have

a cultural revolution before the violent revolution.

The

cultural revolution gives identity: purpose, and direction.

... The revolution being fought now

is a revolution to win

the minds of our people. If we fail to win this, we

cannot

wage the violent one.. When the word is given, we'll

see how tough you are. When it's 'burn', let's see how much

you blow up.

And when it's 'take that white girl's

• head

too', we'll see how tough you are..."

The above source advised that "US" members are

required to study and memorize this booklet. "US" members

are also assigned Swahili names which they use in lieu

of their given names.

• A second source advised that KARENGA had

spoken at various meetings in Los Angeles at which time he

talked of creating an "US" army of 1,000 men, obtaining

weapons and ammunition, guerrilla warfare tactics, and

revolution.

KARENGA also

stated "The only way to get

life is to take a life and as

we get stronger, we will

take what we want from the white man's United

States."

He also stated that if the police killed any "US" members,

the "US" organization would kill some of them.

APPENDIX CONTINUED

The first source above

advised that KARENGA

also stated that race riots throughout the country

were not riots but were actually revolts or revolutions

and that the black people were going to win their

freedom by violence, if necessary.

A third source advised that KARENGA stated

that a revolution would take place in the future and

that no one can believe in black revolution without

believing in armed conflict because the two go hand in hand.

A fourth source advised in August, 1974, that the

US Organization has been evicted from its headquarters at

4302 South Crenshaw Boulevard, Los Angeles, and because

of lack of funds, has been unable to locate a new meeting

place.

The organization has terminated all public meetings.

that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Operations

(SSCIO) has become aware of Jafie's allegations that the FBi

has taken actions which have prevented hir from obtaining oi

keeping a job in

Jaffe claims that his

association with Bureau Agents with regard to Soviet intel-

ligence matters cooled off after he vas identified by a Soviet

defector as cooperating with Soviet Intelligence and

that the

IBI has since deprived him from making a living in his profos

sion.

The SSCIO is looking into Jaife's situation to deternine

if his allegations are true and if the FBI can

from taking such actions in other similar situations. C

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. WarmatT

Re:

Samuel. Adason Jaffe

105-28333

Foules doscotor Eam advised that diate was

recruited by the again about 1962 while he was in Moscow

through his relationship with a Soviet female. Soviet de-

fector JFk Act 6 (4) has confirmed that Jaffe was approached but

does not belleve the approach was successtul. cuatie reported

to the New York Office in 1953 what he interpreted as a recruit-

ment eltore, and he was extensively reinterviewed in 1969

concerning his association with KGB officers in Moscow. There

is no information in Jaffe's file that he was ever reported on

by Col. Penkovskiy,

• During

the interviews with Jalfe, he denied any overt acts helpful

to the kGb, although he admitted a continuing relationship vith

several KGB officers. Both the New York and Washington Field

Offices came to the

conclusion that Jaife was a KGB agent while

in

loscow, but that there was doubt as to whether he continued

lin that role after he vas expelled.

Our relations vith Jaile were tempered by [Sammy's'*W

allegation, and bureau agents in contact with him were circum

spect in any dealings with him thereafter.

jaffe very likely

detected a change in the Agents' attitude which accounts for

his statement that he felt his relationship with them had

cooled off.

There is no evidence contained in Jaffe's file that

either New Yorks or Washington Field or the Bureau has ever taken

action which would affect Jaffe's livelihood.

Following

his return from Hong Kong, Jaffe told his handling Agents that

he was experiencing difficulty in finding a job. He several

tines mentioned his concern that his association with the FBI

might be the reason.

On each occasion, he vas assurcd that

the FBI had never divulged his confidential relationship and

would not do so any time in the fucure.u

Jaffe's file does disclose that during an interview

with Washington riold Agents in 1969, he said that he had

learned Ircm a British Inürliigence contact in llong Kong that

his recall from that city was caused by

Inshington who responded that the British

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

ACTIVITIES (SSC) ; INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT

DIRECTOR IN CHARGE ROBERT E. GEBHARDT BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

• On August 11975, Assistant Director Robert E

Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los

Angeles FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of

the Senate Select Committee, United States

Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by

s investigation of the Black Panther Party

when Gebhardt was the Special Agent in Charge of the San

Francisco Division from 1970 to 1972.

The interview lasted from 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,

and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any

Bureau

representative.

Gebhardt had previously been advised by a Bureau

representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas

of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters

of interview.

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt

was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther

Party investigation on a day to day basis being specifically

advised details of the investigation as it relates to the

It was explained to Seidel that as Special

Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein

over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had

many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

therefore, relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment

of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the

day to day direction of the various matters under investigation,

including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was

encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,

Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for

such consultation to resolve

any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC

when the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and

the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually

terminated.

Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage

was already

in effect upon Gebhardt's arrival eive Decision"

was handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of

the BPP and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.

The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the

discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel inquired as

to whether Gebhardt felt the

Intelligence type investigations should be completely removed

from the criminal investigations which investigations would be

looking toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal

investigations looking toward prosecutions,

much intelligence

information is obtained from time to time which really has no

value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible

value with respect to the direction of the investigation.

some criminal investigations a great deal of intelligence

information may be obtained and in other types, very little.

Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is

made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be

a basis for an investigation which procedures would include

matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

In some instances, in such security investigations

a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained

therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-

gence type investigations should not be removed from or

differentiated from criminal type investigations looking

toward prosecutions since intelligence information is an

outgrowth of the basic investigation.

Gebhardt was asked if he. felt the Cointelpro was a

separate entity distinguished from the basic investigation

and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the

overall investigation in any particular organization or

individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact

legislation which would set forth specific investigative

techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI Or

other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in

Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation

should not be enacted,

and in reply

to the question as to-why such legislation should

not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative

agency, there must of necessity be allowed a certain flexi-

bility

because no two

investigations are exactly alike and the

circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be

related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should

assure the American public that questionable activity such

as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative

agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress

and the American people must rely upon the integrity and

honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the

FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President,

hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees

and finally approved by the Senate.

It was further pointed

out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with

the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention

of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and

if circumstances ever arose which circumstances he could not

contemplate. at this time, wherein it was thought such

activities shöuld be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal

approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.

Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with

this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were

relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI

and Congress.

He was informed that a Senate Oversight

Committee was recently established and it was felt that this

was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

= 3=

HH 55158 DooId:32989640 Page 244

---

## Page 245

standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular

inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as

to our activities. He was informed that there should be

either a joint oversight committee between the House and

Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees

in both the House and Senate,

these committees should be the

entities through which all information relative to the

activities of the FBI should flow.

It was emphasized however, that there should be

regular consultation between these representatives and the

FBI.

Inquiry was made as. to Gebhardt's opinion relative

to the relationship between the Department of Justice and

the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's

pinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be

a free flow of information between the

FBI and the Department

of Justice.

At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed

up his comments by stating that Congress should detinitely

set up a structured oversight procedure of the activities

of the

FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many

of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure

itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will

maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters

usually referred

to as national defense, national security

or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations

must be based on the application of the facts toward a

particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique

that they cannot be clearly applied to a particular Federal

statute, consultation with the Department of Justice shoul

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker was a supervisor

with the San Diego Office of the

FBI from sometime in 1968

Mr. Baker advised that he was a supervisor of the

security squad but could not. recall if the dates mentioned

by Mr. Seidel were correct.

such as investigation of the Communist Party (see appendix),

the Socialist Workers Party (see appendix), the Black Panther

Party, US, Incorporated (see appendix), the Nation of Islam

(see appendix), Espionage, Sabotage matters, and other investi-

gations were conducted on the squad supervised by him, which

supervised the COINTELPRO.

MI. Baker advised that he did supervise this pro-

gram which was initiated by FBI Headquarters and not on the

field' office level.

He stated that as he recalled, a letter

was submitted either monthly, quarterly or semi-annually.

The letter was submitted by a Special Agent whose case load

was such that he could take the time to prepare the letter.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Special Agent

Roy Burns was more of a young, eager, type Agent.

ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Baker replied that this was not true but

that Special Agent Burns had been assigned the COINTELPRO

case because his case load was such that he was able to

handle the program.

MI. Seidel inquired whether Special Agent Roy

Burns was transferred to the Butte Office of the FBi for

disciplinary reasons.

Mr. Baker replied that Special Agent Burns was

originally from Washington State and. had wanted to be trans-

ferred to that area.

Mx. Seidel asked if the Bureau encouraged Agents

Es participate in disruptive, programs and then rewarded them

financially for their efforts.

Mr. Baker replied that the Bureau had an incentive

award program, and if an Agent did a good job in any field, he

could get recognition through an incentive award. Mr. Baker

stated that he could not recall any award being given as a

result of COINTELPRO activity.

Mr. Seidel asked Mr. Baker if he could recall any

information concerning the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP.

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that the operation

of the Free Breakfast Program of the BPP was followed through

sources.

They advised that some of the BPP officials were

stealing money from funds which were to be spent on the

breakfast program.

The breakfast program was served at a

local Catholic church.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that

an official of the Catholic church in San Diego was contacted

regarding the priest in charge of the church where the break-

fast program was being held, who was reportedly an alcoholic.

Mr. Seidel was advised that the priest was transferred from

the church.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SPECIAL AGENT

ROBERT S. BAKER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel asked what Mr. Baker's definition of

the COINTELPRO was.

Mr. Baker replied that the COINTELPRO was a

disruptive type program.

Mr. Seidel stated that the FBI had apparently

written a letter regarding a white girl friend of Kenneth

Denman, a BPP leader in San Diego. He inquired as to why.

this letter was written.

Mr. Baker stated that Denman was considered one

• and if it was possible to keep him from becoming a strong

leader, it would be disruptive to the party.

The fact that

Denman was

s living with a white girl was considered derogalory --

toward him by BPP members in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether such activity.

would have been taken against a leader in an organization

such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

(see description) if the leader of such a group had been

living with a white woman. Would such a letter be appropriate?

Mr. Baker replied that he did not feel that such a

letter would

be appropriate in this case because this organi-

zation involved a

religious leader and our program was not

directed at religious groups but was directed toward black

militant and extremist groups.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Mr. Baker recalled

individuals in the BPP named Tate, Wallace, Denman and Bell.

Mr. Baker stated that he could not recall anything

specific about any of these individuals, except what he had

previously stated concerning Denman. He said he could recall

the names but nothing more concerning these individuals.

Mr. Seidel then mentioned an incident wherein the

San Diego Office of the FBI had furnished information to the

LOS

Angeles Office of the FBl for transmission to local auth-

orities concerning

a group of BPP members from San Diego who

were traveling to Los Angeles to attend a funeral.

Mr. Baker stated that he could recall that such an

incident occurred and that information was furnished stating

that BPP members from San Diego would be carrying

concealed

weapons.

He said he thought the furnishing of this information

resulted in some of the BPP members being arrested in Los

Angeles.

and whether the FBI went to the-mother to put pressure on

another member of the family.

Mr. Baker stated that he vaguely recalled such a

case but could not recall the details and could not be

certain this had occurred.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether the FBI had any

technical surveillances on the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Baker stated that he knew of none and added that

such coverage was not needed in San Diego because there were

good sources in the BPP who could furnish excellent coverage.

Mr. Baker stated that he believes he would have known of any

such installations covering the BPP in San Diego.

Mr. Seidel then asked why such techniques were

not used in San Diego if they were used in San Francisco.

Mr. Baker replied that such techniques were not

needed in San Diego due to the good source coverage of

party activity.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether there was a

conflict between US, Incorporated, and the BPP in San

Diego.

Mr. Baker replied that US, Incorporated, head-

quarters were in Los Angeles.

There was a power struggle

petweek the two groups for membership of blacks and much

travel occuried by US, Incurporated, leaders frontos- -

Angeles to san Diego and Mexico, and from San Diego to

Los Angeles. There were considerable conflict between the

two groups.

Mr. Seidel asked whether Mr. Baker recalled

Ron Karenga.

Mr. Baker replied that he did recall Ron Karenga

as being the Los Angeles leader of US, Incorporated.

Mr. Seidel asked whether Mr. Baker recalled some

cards stating "Ron Karenga is impotent" which were printed

in Los Angeles and some of which might have been sent to

Mr. Baker replied that he does not recall these

cards but this could have been correct.

Mr. Seidel asked if Mr. Baker recalled some cartoons

being drawn concerning the BPP.

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that there were

two or three cartoons prepared depicting strife between US,

Incorporated, and the BPP.

Mr. Seidel then stated that these cartoons were

prepared by the Bureau Laboratory.

Mr. Baker stated that he did not recall.

Mr. Baker advised Mx. Seidel that US, Incorporated,

and the BPP were led by and made up of people with extensive

criminal records,

and because of this and their gèneral

demeanor, the FBI did not really have to provoke or dis-

rupt them because they kept themselves in a constant state

of turmoil.

He stated that Special Agents connected with

the COINTELPRO did not devote much time to the program be

cause oi heavy case loads.of. other matters and..because-they....-

assisted in working criminal matters such as -bank robberies.-

and other criminal violations.

Mr. Baker advised Mr. Seidel that a great. deal of

time was spent by the Special Agents working with their

sources because they had to be extremely careful that they

were protected. If a crime was planned and a souce had

knowledge of it, the source would try to keep the crime from

being committed. If it was not possible to prevent the crime,

the source might be forced to participate, and if arrested, a

problem would becreated in attempting to get the source out

of jail and still conceal his identity as a source.

Mr. Seidel inquired of Mr. Baker as to the names of

the Agents he dealt with in Los Angeles and San Francisco in

connection with COINTELPRO

Mr. Baker stated that he recalled that Supervisor

Albert Clark had something to do with the program in San

Francisco, and in Los Angeles he dealt with Supervisor Richard

Bloeser and Bill Knowland.

Seidel:

Wirick:

You understand that this is an informal interview

and is in connection with the Bureau's COINTELPRO

as it relates to the FBI investigation of the BPP?

Yes, but for what purpose is the Senate conducting

this survey?

To aid in formation of now legislation so that the

FBI and other Government agencies will have more

definite guidelines to follow.

I believe the Congress already through lack of

information, isolated instances and some hysteria

have enacted too many restrictive laws that prevent

the FBI and other Government agencies from protecting

the law abiding element of our society from the

"bad guys".

(He was in general agreement) Did you handle the

COINTELPRO from 1970 through March, 1971?

Yes, but I believe the BPP ceased to function locally

about November of December, 1970. As I recall my

function was to write a progress type letter regarding

progress which described the illegal activities of

members of the BPP and to report that this information

had been furnished local police agencies but intormation

generally emanated from confidential informants.

Seidel:

What type of illegal activities and did your program

in any way instigate

illegal activities

on the part

of the BPP?

Wirick:

Criminal acts committed by local members of the BPP

is what I was referring to. I don't believe it was

ever necessary to instigate any illegal acts or in

any way entrap BPP members in criminal acts. The

majority of local BPP members were thieves, narcotics

addicts,

lazy, unemployed and were hero worshipers of

the BPP

in Oakland, California.

They wanted to emulate

the Oakland organization, but their own dishonesty,

et cetera, was a constant source of turmoil amongst

the local

group.

I recall, date unknown, information was received

regarding Kenny Denmon (Kenneth Lee Denmon), one time

head of the local BPP, that he was using stolen credit

cards.

Information was received that Walter Nallace

(Walter Carl Wallace, Jr.) was on narcotics and that

he and his wite, Velma, were

stealing to get money

for narcotics and that Velma's mother was also involved

in local thefts.

All above information was furnished local law agencies

and local arrests were

made.

Furnishing the

above type of information is a function and esponsibility

of the FBI.

Seidel:

The BPP in San Diego was very effective in causing

their own problems and their own extinction and their

criminal activities were not restricted to the examples

I've given.

Did the COINTELPRO try to disrupt the BPP Breakfast

Program?

No, not to my knowledge. I recall that soon after •

the Breakfast Program was started that other members

of the BPP accused Ken Denmon of stealing money from

contributions made to the Program.

On second thought I believe we did disrupt the BPP

Breakfast Program in that we received complaints

from

several dairys and bread companies, et cetera,

that

they had been approached by BPP members with

veiled threats of extortion if they did not donate

quantities of food et cetera to the BPP Breakfast

Progran.

The FBI and local police investigated and

I believe as a result their practices were discontinued,

but the investigation

failed to establish a prosecutable

offense of extortion.

Did you have any connection with distribution of

"cartoons"' depicting BPP members

as compromising each

other et cetera?

Wirick:

They featured "cartoons" showing the "pigs" (police)

stabbed

et cetera.

showing how the BPP would kill

the "honkies" (white people). They were similar to

the propaganda leaflets used by the Nazis against

American troops before an attack. The articles in the

BPP newspaper were even more foul.

Seidel:. Did the COINTELPRO promote dissension between the BPP

and the US Group (see Appendix page)?

• Wirick:

Not to my knowledge.

As I recall there was never

any need to.

They were constantly at odds with each

other and on a gang type basis were trying to eliminate

each other.

I believe Sylvester Bell, a san Diego bi

member was killed by an US Group member and John Savage,

another local BPP member was killed by an US Group

member.

In Los Angeles two other BPP members, names not

recalled, were allegedly killed by US Group members.

I believe this led to the popular

saying in Southeast

San Diego section where most blacks live that the score

(game) was, "US 4 - BPP O"

Wirick:

After thought, no.

Because the paper itself was

so vile and anti-white that the odor would never

stop BPP members from reading same. I've always

hoped that a large segment of the population,

especially the "do-gooders" could or would experience

the nauseous

reaction I have felt after reading the

illiterate, foul-mouthed, anti-white, anti-Government,

BPP paper.

I think everybody should

read a copy of

the BPP paper so that they will know the type and

character of BPP members.

What do you think about anonymous letters sent to

spouses of BPP members saying the husband was sleeping

with a white girl, et cetera?

Most wives of the members I recall were also BPP

members and/or common-law-wives.

Many BPP members

did have liaison with whitr girls but I doubt if

such a letter would bother most spouses of BPP members.

However, such a letter might be of value under certain

example: the stories that were spread

during World War Il which were not necessarily all true

regarding Hitler, Mussolini, General Patton and others.

In your opinion was the COINTELPRO of any value?

Should it be changed?

Do you have any suggestions

for changes, or should it be eliminated completely?

Yes, as I recall, it acted as a progress letter of the

BPP, Its direction, Its dissension, Its change in

as a summary of its activities for FBIHQ. I recall that

As

The duties for the most part

consisted ci preparing letters

to the Bureau asking for

Not any more than any other

What type of things did you

do?

I do not recall at this time

any specific action taken in

I do recall that

a Black Panther leader,

Walter

Wallace, was removed as leader

of the party in San Diego. I

believe it was suspected that

he might have cooperated with

the FBI.

This could have been

accomplished by interviewing

him where the interview could

be seen by other party members.

If the Agents shook his hand,

smiled, and acted like he was

a friend, it might plant the

seed of

suspicion in the minds

of other BPP members,

I do

not recall specifically whether

this happened but at any rate,

Wallace was not trusted and

was removed as leader of the

party.

Could such a thing get Wallace

killed or injured?

I had it assigned to me be-

cause it was a new program

and it took some time to get

it established and working.

Most of the success was probably

due to information obtained

regarding criminal violations,

mostly local in nature, which

was furnished to local law

enforcement officers, causing

the arrest of BPP members.

This would have been done

whether or not we had a

COINTELPRO. It was necessary

to prepare a letter to the

Bureau asking authority to

take action and then wait

for a reply authorizing the

activity.

Many times suggested

COINTELIRO activity suggestions

would be turned down.

SA Petersen:

Was contact with the police

formal or informal?

Contact was personal or telephonic

contact and at one time, intorma-

tion furnished to individual officers

was confirmed by letter to the

Chief of Police. It is not re-

called if this was the policy

during the time COINTELPRO was

assigned to me.

What happened to SA Roy Burns?

He was transferred to the Butte,

Montana Field Office.

Did he do anything wrong?

understand Agents were sometimes

transferred to Butte as a disci-

plinary measure.

SA Burns wanted to be transferred

to Butte and requested the trans-

fer.

The Special Agent in Charge

(SAC), MI. Evans, was transferred

there

and

may have helped SA

Burns get moved there.

How old is Bob Baker:

Probably 51 or 52 years old. .

Did he retire early?

No. He was in a position to

retire and retired because he

prior to a certain date, such as

June 30.

Were the BPP and US, Inc. both

violence oriented groups?

Very definitely. There was extreme

friction between the BPP and US,

Inc. at all times.

Do you recall some caricatures

used in connection with COINTELPRO?

Yes.

Who had the program at that time?

I believe SA Burns had it then.

What were the cartoons?

I recall seeing them but do not

recall any specific cartoon.

Do you think anything

• done in

COINTELPRO could have had a

reaction causing

someone to kill

an individual in the other group?

Because of the extreme antagonism

between the two groups, anything

we did would have had

about the

elephant.

I do not think COINTELPRO

had that kind of impact.

I would hesitate to do this

Mr. Seidel:

SA Petersen:

Diego was teaching children to

hate and kill police officers.

They planned violent criminal

acts and were making plans to

take over the established govern

nent at the first opportunity.

If a leader of such a group could

be discredited and removed, it

would help to keep the group from

becoming stronger, as they would

have to

select a new leader, and

he would have to get the group

reorganized. Denmon had many

additional weaknesses which could

be used in a counter-intelligence

program.

Do you recall a letter being sent

to BPP Headquarters saying a

leader of the BPP was cooperating

with the police in Los Angeles?

I do not recall such a letter.

Do you recall some cards being

sent to San Diego from Los Angeles

saying, "Ron Karenga is impotent"?

No, I do not recall such cards:

Ron

Karenga was a leader of US,

Inc., not the BPP.

Do you recall that cartoons were

to be sent to BPP members to dis-

credit the leaders?

I recall the cartoons but do not

recall whether they were set to

Memorandum

TO

: The Deputy Attorney General

Attn: K. William O'Connor®

PRos Plector, FBI

SUBJECT: PROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS

TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TILES

DATE:..

..."

July 18, 1975

in response to your memoranaum dated July 18, 1975,

captioned as above; we observe that the "substantial negotiations"

which produced the proposed procedures did not include participation

by a representative ot the FBi and that the request for our views

concerning disclosure of highly sensitive FBI material was first

réceived at 11:14 a.m. today with a reply expected by 2:00 p.m.

today. We respectfully suggest that not only should you afford greater

opportunity for an expression of our views on this matter, but that

any such proposed procedures should be presented to the

President's

Counsel for concurrence and for an expression of the President's views

as to the general policy of the Executive Branch in this regard. Further,

you may want to consider addressing the problem of the impact such

general disclosure of files would have on pending criminal investigations.

A preliminary review in the time available revealed that

certain items require considerable modification. For example, Item (3)(c)

should be reconsidered with the following language:

"An exception to (a) and (b) above is made for information

that would tend to identify sources to whom the FBI has

an obligation of confidentiality as to which no access

will be furnished unless the identity already has been made

known to the Committee, or unless the Attorney General,

the Chairman and the Vice Chairman jointly agree on the

limited disclosure ci such identity to the Chairman and the

Vice Chairman. "

Item (6)(b) should be reconsidered with the following language:

"If the Task Force Leader has any objections to the

excisions or paraphrases, the FBi will furnish a

written statement of the grounds for its position to

the Special Counsel who shal resolve the matter by

negotiation within 24 hours."

Item (8) should be reconsidered with the following language:

"The Staff and the Members of the Committee may examine

the original materials to which the Staff is given access

as extensively as necessary between the hours of 8:00 a.m.

and 5:30 p.m,, Monday through Friday, in the FBI J. Edgar

Hoover Building at Room 4171. "

In light of the difficulties described, it is my strong

recommendaton that such procedures should not be nastly agreed upon

with the Committee and that full discussion should be had concerning this

matter by representatives of the FBI, the Atiorney General, the Committee

and the Counsel to the President.

COMMENTS ON PROPOSED PROCEDURES

I. 48 hour lead time is very short and may create problens; 24 hour

reaction time may be unreasonable for Attorney General.

2. The provision seems a little odd, out of context of negotiations.

3. Suggest that in 3(a), last line, word and should be or and

"peculiarly sensitive" read to modify both foreign intelligence

sources and ongoing operations.

4. No comment

5. No comment

6. Time frames are very restrictive; there should be a stated

opportunity for TFL to nock out any objections with FBI, before

raising to Special lounsel "

...If the issue is not promptly

resolved between the TFl and the FBI, the materials in issue

will be conveyed..."

7. Define "screened" by reference to 6(a) above

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

I have received your letter of July 15 regarding

access/delivery of documents requested in the Committee's

letter of July

9, 1975.

The following relates specifically

to the procedure

suggested for handling documents on the

so called "Kissinger 17"

surveillance, which is also applied

in your letter to materials relating to electronic sur-

veillance of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic

City in August 1964, materials

relating to the electronic

Jurycillance 0E

DE.

King, and possiuly int ûà c files.

I regard this suggested procedure as a major step

forward and a recognition that previous arrangements were

too cumbersome and time-consuming. Nevertheless, there

'are certain practical problems with the procedure which may

be resolved by interpretation. For example, I assume that

application of the procedure to the Atlantic City conven-

tion matters does not foreclose the Committee from receiving

for use at its offices actual documents or portions of

documents, as well as summaries. I understand that the

FBI has no objection to providing such documents on this

matter to the Committee for use at its offices.

Therefore, in order that the procedure you suggest

may be applicable

tó all. areas of Committee inquiry claimed

by the Department to involve particularly sensitive matters,

it should be interpreted as follows: the Committee starE

will have direct access to all files and materials at FBIHQ:

the Committee start shall select certain documents from the

files which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiry

and necessary for the examination of witnesses or the es

tablishment of certain facts during the course of the

inquiry; the FBI shall at that time designate specific

portions of such documents which might jeopardize par-

ticularly sensitive sources or methods; with respect

to such specifically designated portions of documents,

the Committee staff will prepare appropriate excisions

or summaries of the information; the summaries will be

checked at that time with senior Bureau executives

to

ensure the protection of particularly sensitive FBI

sources or methods; thereafter, the excised documents

and summaries will be removed to the Committee's offices;

the Committee staff may check back to the original documents

as extensively as necessary; staff notes on the designated

specific portions of documents will not be removed from

FBIHQ; and Committee members may, of course, at any time

see the documents which the staff has seen.

I believe this interpretation can serve as a work-

able framework for Committee access to particularly sensitive

FBI materials. You may be assured that the Task Force shares

your concern for the need to provide sharial handling tech-

niques to convey or secure any particularly sensitive

information or materials, as indicated in the outline for

Inquiry Procedures.

we hope this interpretation will

'facilitate the mutual effort by the Committee and the

Department of Justice to accomplish this purpose.

I would appreciate receiving your immediate advice

to me as to whether any further interpretation of this

matter is required. Any public discussion of these arrange-

ments and interpretations should be cast in such terms as

will not jeopardize particularly sensitive FBI sources.

the so called "Kissinger 17" surveillance will be made available to

you and specific appropriately cleared staff in Room 4171 of the

Hoover building. These documents may be reviewed and studied there,

and you and such staff may take such notes as you deem appropriate;

we have agreed that the notes are to be left in the secure room of

the Hoover Building during your study, When your study is completed,

you may prepare a summary of the information which you consider to be

appropriate for Connittee use. The summary must be checked with

senior Bureau executives to ensure the protection of national security

matters, protection of confidential sources of infornation, and

observation of privacy considerations.

Thereafter, the approved

surmary may be removed to the Committee's office and all the staff

notes will be destroyed. You may check the summary back to the

original documents as extensively as necessary, in Room 4171.

After your review of the mail cover summaries and any under-

We will furnish to you, for your study at Senate Select.

After you have reviewed that analysis, I will discuss with you

an appropriate further step with regard to the 0 & C files if such is

I trust that this letter accurately reflects our understanding

I would appreciate meeting with you and Mr. Schwarz and

Mic. Smothers around July 18, for the purpose of discussing any

problems which you may have identified and to clarify any out-

standing documentary request which you may have, and to agree upon

an appropriate schedule. Since we have received several additional

you may want to consider addressing the problem of the impact such

certain items require considerable modification. For example, Ilem (S)e)

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 5, 1975,

Supervisor Richard H: Bloeser

was interviewed by SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel at the

Los Angeles FBI Office regarding the COINTELPRO/Black Panther

Party (BPP) •

Mr..

Seidel advised Supervisor Bloeser that the

interview was voluntary, but did not advise Supervisor

Bloeser of his rights in this matter.

Mr. Seidel inquired of Supervisor Bloeser as to

how many offices he had served in, his length of service in

the Bureau, and how long had been spent on intelligence

investigations.

Supervisor Bloeser replied that he had

served in Philadelphia, El Paso and Los Angeles, had been

in the Bureau approximately 24½-years, and had been assigned

to intelligence work for 22 years.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Supervisor Bloeser

believed that the Bureau had placed undue pressure on the

field to come up with counter intelligence proposals concerning

the BPP and was it difficult to come up with a proposal.

Supervisor Bloeser responded that there was no undue pressure

placed on the fiold vy the Bureau, that the COINTELPRO/BPP

was merely another case assigned to an agent and that agent!

as in any other case, had the responsibility of handling the

matter whether it concened the solving of a case or the

submission of proposals.. Mr. Seidel was also informed that

it was not unduly difficult to come up with a proposal and that

a number of proposals were rejected at the field level and.

never submitted to the Bureau.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically as to counter

intelligence proposals involving cartoons ridiculing the BPP.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Supervisor Bloser responded that he vaguely remembered such

proposals but without reviewing the file had no definite

recollection.

Mr. Seidel did not request that the file be

reviewed.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically about a business

card which allegedly had been prepared by the Bureau bearing

the phrase "Karenga is impotent."

Mr. Seidel requested

Supervisor Bloeser's views on

the distribution of this card

by the FBI. Supervisor Bloeser responded®

that he

vaguely

remembered the card, that he thought it was humorous, and

that the word impotent had various meanings.

Mr. Seidel then inquired about the blood feud

which existed

in the past between the US Organization and

the BPP and the efforts of the Bureau to keep this feud.

alive. and thus promote violence.

He specifically inquired

as to the personal feelings of Supervisor Bloeser concerning

any counter intelligence proposals

which, if placed in

operation, could lead to violence between the

two groups.

Supervisor Bloeser responded first that personally

he had no apologies for the counter intelligence program as

whole, that proposals submitted six or seven years ago

were believed necessary at that time due

to the circumstances,

specifically that at that time the EPI and the us Organization

were involved in violent activity against the community as a

whole. Mr. Seidel was informed that the feud between the US

Organization and the BPP occurred long before the FBI

COINTELPRO became involved in the feud and that any proposals

approved by the Bureau had relatively little effect on the

violence

committed by either group

Mr. Seidel was also

reminded that six or seven years ago the Congress of the

United States fully supported the war in Vietnam in which

thousands of people were killed but that under today's

circumstances no support has been given to South Vietnam.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel then posed a hypothetical question

involving the following factors: Would Supervisor Bloeser

now or in the past approve a counter intelligence proposal

whereby one extremist with a criminal record of violence

be anonymously informed that another extremist with a

might be injured or

killed. Supervisor Bloeser replied that under the present

conditions such a proposal would not be approved, but

that he could not give an answer as to what his

feelings

might have been six or seven years ago under any given

situation.

Mr. Seidel was again reminded that Congress

in the past has not hesitated to support wars which kill

thousands of people but that recently they have critizedeized

the CIA for allegedly plotting to assassinate one individual

whose death might prevent a war. Mr. Seidel

was also informed

that it was ironic that. Congress was investigating another

agency of the Federal Government which was attempting to

prevent revolutionary violence in this country.

-

Mr. Seidel

then inquired into the counter

intelligence proposals approved by the Bureau in relation

to the actress Jean Seberg and Raymond Hewitt, a leader

of the BPP.

This proposal concerned the fact that Seberg,

who was then married to a French producer, admitted being

pregnant'by Hewitt who was also married at the time....the

Bureau approved anonymonsly leaking this information to a

Hollywood columnist.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether

Supervisor Bloeser did or did not believe that this was an

invasion of privacy. Supervisor Bloeser responded that the

item was news worthy and that it would have been any. fair game

for any newsmen had they come across it in the course of their

ousiness which they could: nave probably easily done, and that

certainly Congress would not have critizeds newspaper fo

printing

such an item or claim it to be an ivasion of privacy.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to the purpose of this particular

operation and he was informed that Miss Seberg was giving

support to the BPP and that it was hoped that such publicity

would prevent any future support by her of the BPP:

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He was further advised that it was the responsibility of the

FBI to determine who was funding revolutionary groups in this

country•

Mr. Seidel then inquired as to whether or not it

was difficult to conduct intelligence investigations under

present statutes and under the Criminal Rules of Procedure.

He was informed that it was somewhat difficult to conduct an

effective intelligence operation under present circumstances

and that perhaps new legislative or executive orders would be

helpful to the FBI in order to allow the FBI to continue its

investigations in the Domestic Intelligence field. Mr. Seidel

inquired as to whether it would be helpful to have specific

legislation which might completely separate criminal and

ntelligence operations so one would not taint the other..

He was informed that if such legislation coula be enacted

that

it would undoubtedly help the FBI.

The interview lasted approximately two hours and

it was not necessary to consult with another Bureau

representative during this time.

responded he could not remember, but believed general

criminal work.

Seidel requested to know what specific

instructions were issued with regard to operating

Cointelpro/Black Panther Party. SA Ward advised

that due to his employment agreement, the sensitive

nature of the bureau work, and the possible overlap

of Bureau investigation, he did not feel he could

respond to any further questions.

worked criminal matters himself and

knew the need

for secrecy.

Palos Verdes, and Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.

SA Ward advises that he is aware that the

Director waived his employment agreement with certain

exceptions regarding privileged areas.

With this in

ATE 10/17/00 BISPALMIGF

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

I am writing to call your attention to a mat-

ter which may be a cause of concern to you and to the

Select Committee at some time in the future.

As von may know, a special unit has been estab-

inEù in mu 1 Intelligenes Division Lo Kindle Lis

Committee's requests for materials and to handle certain

arrangements for the Committee staff's interviews.

The

Special Agents assigned to this unit accompany Bureau

witnesses to the Committee offices, travel to out-of-town

locations where Committee staff interviews are conducted,

and apparently "de-brief" interview subjects after the

interviews.

One possible problem has arisen with this arrange-

ment.

As you are aware, one of the alleged abuses which

the Committee is examining pursuant to S. Res. 21 involves

the FBI's activities with respect to the late Dr. Martin

Luther King, Jr.

As the inquiry has proceeded, informa-

tion has been developed to indicate that one of the

Special Agents who has been handling Committee staff inter-

"de-briefing" witnesses, and, presumably, compiling

materials with respect to the king matter was also the

case agent during the time that some of the

alleged FBI improprieties regarding Dr. King took place.

Moreover, as a logical step in our investigation, it was

recently necessary to interview this Special Agent to

determine the nature and extent of his involvement in and

knowledge of the alleged abuses at the time when he served

as supervisory case agent with respect do the King case.

During the interview he did provide detailed information

concerning his substantial participation in this matter.

The Committee in no way intens at this juncture

to pre-judge the propriety of the FBI's activities with

respect to DI. King, and it would be inapropriate to

characterize

the conduct of any of the fureau's personnel

regarding this case until all the facts are in.

Neverthe-

less, I am concerned that in this kind o situation, the

interests of the FBI and the Department of Justice might

best be served, from the standpoint of apearances, by re-

considering the assignment of this Special Agent to the

King matters.

It is possible that some may conclude that

there is a conflict between the Special Agent's personal

interest, and the interests of the FBI and the Justice

Popentmont in enguring that fall disclorre to the commit-

tee is made with respect to this case..

Finally, let me assure you that the Committee

has no evidence that the present arrangement has preventea

the committee fron obtaining the full disclosures sought;

but it seems to me that it would be mutlly beneficial

for appropriate steps to be taken so that we will both be

able to assure the American people and ihe Congress that

our oversight responsibilities were fulfilled in an objec-

tive and impartial way.

I hope you will share my view that this course

will best serve our respective interests

and, of course,

the interests of the country.

or tray identify FBI confidential sources; (2) information which may

adversely altect on-going FEl investigations; (3) information concerning

sensitive methods and techniques; and (4) information obtained from

third agences, including foreign intelligence agencies. Witnesses may

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510

August 28, 1975

Honorable Edward H. Levi

Attorney General

U. S. Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

I would like to bring to your personal attention

a situation which has severely restricted our efforts to

establish the relevant facts with respect to one. of the

areas of alleged abuse which is the subject of inquiry

pursuant to S. Res. 21.

I have been informed by the staff that numerous

materials which have been requested during the past several

weeks which pertain to the FBI!s activities with respect to

DI. Martin Luther King, Ji., have been withheld from the.

Committee by the Department because of concern expressed

by Mr. Harry Wachtel, the attorney for the King family and

estate,

as to the appropriateness of the Department's

"disseminating" to the Committee contents of conversations

monitored during electronic surveillances of Dr. King.

Upon reviewing the lists of materials requested,

I am at a loss to understand how most of those items could

conceivably be encompassed by the issues raised by Mr. Wachtel,

especially in view of the fact that our letters of request

have specific

have specifically pointed out that tape recordings and trans-

cripts should not be supplied.

Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to

place the Committee formally on record as reaffirming all of

the outstanding requests for materials relating to the King

matters, with the limited exception of (1) Mr. DeLoach's

August 24 - 27, 1964 memoranda which pertain to the 1964

Democratic National Convention, and (2) those portions of any

other requested materials which actually sumnarize or quote

from conversations monitored during any electronic surveill-

ance of Dr. King.

Delivery is requested by Wednesday, September 3,

1975, pursuant to the provisions of the general procedural

agreement between the Department and the Committee which

governs all Committee requests.

I understand that the

Bureau has been collecting the King-related materials upon

receipt of each of our requests, and therefore I presume.

that there will be no substantial burden in meeting the

September 3 date.

Your cooperation is appreciated.

I am taking the liberty of sending Mr. Wachtel
