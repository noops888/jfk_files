still residing in Pittsburgh, but he does not know

• them personally.

CV 344-C stated he had known GUY VOLPE, who later died

of pneumonia at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and at one time when he

was wanted by the local authorities on some charge around Pittsburgh,

Pennsylvania, he had hidden out in the home of a GUISSEPPI

Roman Gardens, Mayfield Road, section of Cleveland, is the second

in command in Cleveland under MILANO.

He stated he did not

know FRANK BRANCATO well but he believed that he would be next

in command in the Calabrese group in Cleveland and under MILANO

and DE AUGUSTINI.

Cv 344-c stated that there would be two distinct groups

in the organization in the Cleveland area or in Northeastern Ohio

and as far west as roledo.

He stated

the set up is unusual in

that the Calabrese group is more highly respected than the Sicilian

group in the geographical area. He stated his opinion comes from

reactins to different arguments which have arisen and would have

later been settled by meetings. He stated the Sicilian group

operates its own enterprises and there is apparently a pact that

they and the Calabrese will not encroach on each other's enterprises.

In this geographical area, the Sicilian group inclues

JAMES LICAVOLI, aka Jack White, Cleveland; "WHITEY"

BESASE of

Toledo ünder LICAVOLI and ANGELO PERNA of

he has heard that a "BONES" BATTISTA of Canton, Ohio, is more or

less in control in that city at present. He had supported the

right candidate in a local election there and was able to operate,

but needed a "bank roll" for his operation.

He sought outside

help and, therefore, LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALLE and ANTHONY DELSANTER

became his partners

in a

• bookie and numbers operation.

At Warren, Ohio, CV 344-C advised ANTHONY DELSANTER"

became "boss" of the areä

became obstreperous and uncontrolable, the "organization" "dumped".

him.

He also stated that CHARLES IMBURGIA, operator of the

Sunrise Inn, East Market Street, Warren, Ohio, may now be affiliated

with the Sicilian group of LICAVOLI, but at one time several years

the pittsburgh group headed by RIPEPI.

At Akron, Ohio, the territory is controled by the

Sicilian group operating in Toledo, Canton, Warren, and Youngstown,

Ohio.

CV 344-0 advised that JAMES

LA FATCH seemed

to be the

represenative of LICAVOLI in that area together with his brother,

TONY, and would be under the direct supervision of "WHITEY" BESASE

of Toledo and LICAVOLI in Cleveland, Ohio.

an "organization" representative and although a Calabrese, will

"hustle" with the Calabrese and Sicilian groups:

not consider him a power, but stated he is a member of the "organiza-

tion" and operates the Ritz Bar in Mansfield, Ohio.

At Youngstown, Ohio; the informant advised there are the

same two groups in the

"organization" as in Cleveland, Ohio.

The

Calabrese has someaction and the Sicilian group under LICAVOLI

have their own ventures. Both have respect for one another's

enterprises.

ROMEO' and MALLAMO is close to ANTHONY MILANO In Cleveland. MALLAMO

him.

Second in command, taking a more active part and soon to be

the leading representative of the Calabrese, 1s JAMES PRATO, aka

"Two Gun Jimmy" of Poland, Ohio, who is a nephew of MALLAMo.

The

informant stated when the barbut game moved to Struthers, Ohio,

from Youngstown;

ohio,

Following the death of VINCE DE NIRO (7/17/61),

they moved the game in the property of the CARABBIA brothers and

only put up with them since they controled the city administration

in Struthers, Ohio, to the extent they would be allowed to

operate without interference.

Regarding the Sicilian group of the "organization" in

Youngstown, CV. 344-C stated he could not say If VINCE J. DE NIRO,

bombing victim

"of 7/17/61, was a member of the "organization" or

not. He stated, however,

that DE NIRO's murder caused great

concern among all members of the "organization."

He stated that

of all the murders committed in the Youngstown

area, this was the

only murder where members of the "organization"

made active efforts

to

determine his killer.

He stated 1f DE NIRO was not a member, he

was a big source of income for the organization and had been

cooperative after having been "shaken down" by the "organization."

CV 344-C stated the "organization" made no inquiry of

him following the bombing murder of CAVALLARO and for his reason

he believed CAVALLARO was

killed for getting out of line.

if he had been killed without the sanction of the "organization"

they would have inquired as to who was responsible for the killing

of one of their members.

He stated that in his opinion, CAVALLARO

had a portion of DE NIRO's operation and apparently tried to "hog"

the entire operation after his death.

Regarding JASPER "FATS" AJELLO, JR., aka, the informant

advised he is no longer held in high respect

• because he has "gotten

out of line" by bad publicity and by engaging in armed robbery and

burglary. He stated that AIELLO had formerly been well thought of

and in Youngstown, 'he occupied about the same position at one time

as TONY DELSANTER occupies at present in Warren. He noted that

DELSANTER and AIELLO are

Calabrese or Sicilian groups and did not contribute to either and

especially Cleveland.

Canton, Ohio, whose body was found stuffed in the trunk of his

car at Canton, Oh1o, on 9/3/63, the "organization" made no inquiry

He gave the following example:

of his means of livellhood which 1s frowned upon by the "organization",

backed a sheriff in his candidacy

for the office at Mansfield, Ohio.

As a result of this back, he was allowed by the successful

candidate to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield, Ohio.

The

sheriff was not backed by TONY MOLLICA, a member of the "organization"

at Mansfield, Ohio.

CV 344-C stated when MOLLICA noted that PANDELLI'S

operation, was a money maker, he approached PANDELLI and told him

that people in town were talking and saying that he, MOLLICA,

was

responsible for the house being able to operate.

was giving him a bad name.

When PANDELLI was not

receptive to the attempts öf MOLLICA,

MOLLICA then sought the aid

story. ROMEO

told PANDELLI, according to CV 344-C, that he should

close down for a couple of months so that things could be "cleared

ROMEO told PANDELLI that he was a friend of his father,

GUISSIPPI PINDILLI. PANDELLI refused to close and CV 344-0 advised

according to what PANDELLI later told him, he wrote a letter explain-

ing the situation to his father in Buenos Aires. CV. 344-C stated

PANDELLI then received a letter from his father which instructed

him to take this letter to ANTHONY MILANO, in Cleveland,

• which

apparently PANDELLI did.

"A little later PANDELLI received a call

from "WHITEY" BESASE, Toledo, Ohio, who instructed him to appear

with MOLLICA at the home of JIMMIE LA FATCH in Akron, Ohio.

CV 344-C advised PANDELLI refused fearing that he would

be "dumped" en route or at the meeting. PANDELLI called ANTHONY

MILANO at Cleveland in the presence of

MOLLICA and MILANO talked

to MOLLICA at this time.

He told him he was instructing PANDELLI

to accompany him to the meeting but that if a "hair on the head of

PANDELLI" was harmed, he would see that the whole bunch was taken

care of.

for the meeting at JAMES

CV 344-C advised he learned that MOLLICA lied and he

denied he had

said what he had and ROMEO became infuriated and left.

Everyone else shook hands with PANDELLI and he was told he could

continue to "operate" and he was not "out of line." In addition,

to the above mentioned, others present during this meeting were

LA FATCH, "WHITEY" BESASE, LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALTS, ANTHONY

DELSANTER, FRANK BRANCATO and many strangers not known to Cy 344-c.

CV 344-0 stated about two weeks later, PANDELLI was

called to

the Ritz Bar operated by MOLLICA by MIKE ROMEo.

ROMEO

denounced MOLLICA as a "liar" in front of PANDELLI and then instructed

PANDELLI to relay what had happened to ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland

and to tell him

i that all had been cleared up. CV 344-0 stated

PANDELLI advised he did not go to MILANO with this message, but

such minor details.

RE: STEUBENVILLE "ORGANIZATION"

CV 344-C stated JAMES TRIPODI fully controls the

Steubenville, Ohio, area and exerts some influence into certain

sections of West Virginia. He stated that if there is to be

anything done illegally in the Steubenville, Ohio, area 1t is

necessary to first clear with TRIPODI, otherwise

the parties

are on their own:

CV 344-0 stated that several years back an "organization"

member's restaurant known as the Baron Restaurant owned by COSMO

QUATRONE was held up by some armed robbers from the Cleveland area.

The group included DAVE TIBERZIO, THOMAS "LAUGHING TOMMY" RUDELICK,

VINCENT INNOCENZI and DOMINICK MAFRICI.
