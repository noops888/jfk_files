Memo Dated 14 August 1972

From DC/Security Research Staff

Dated 12 July 1973

A careful review of the PDDONOR file substantiates

the fact that there were three unequivocal financial commit-

ments made to PDDONOR at the time of his defection in

February 1964. These three commitments were:

a. He would be paid $25,000 for each of the two

years he cooperated in place. Total $50,000.

.b. He would receive $10,000 for his part in

identifying William Vassal, a British

Admiralty employee as a KGB agent.

C.

He would receive $25,000 per year salary

from the Agency.

2. The question at issue now is whether an additional

commitment was also made to PDDONOR to the effect that the

Agency would provide financial assistance to him to purchase

home.

According to PDDONOR, on 30 January 1964 in Geneva

prior to his defection in a conversation with his case officer,

Mr. Tennent Bagley he stated, "I will arrive with what I have

on my back

- no home

- no roof - no anything."

The reply to

PDDONOR waS

as follows; "This will be taken care of.

It will

be provided."

This exchange in PDDONOR's view, constituted

what he believes was a commitment on the part of the Agency

to provide him with financial assistance in the purchase of

a home.

A memorandum dated 16 February 1970, written by

Mr. Bruce Solie describes this verbal exchange between PDDONOR

and his case officer. (See Reference A). In addition, a

memorandum dated 14

August 1972 also written by Mr. Solie

(Reference B) states that "Nosenko stated that prior to his

defection in Geneva, he discussed his future with Bagley and

made three requests, these being:

he discated his

a. Employment at $25,000 per year;

b. $50,000 in savings account;

c. Assistance in purchasing a house.

According to Nosenko, Bagley, a day or two later, informed

Nosenko that his requests had been approved and Nosenko

considers

this constituted a valid verbal contract."

3. From PDDONOR's viewpoint therefore an additional

commitment, quite separate and

apart from the three listed

in paragraph I was made to him.

Consequently, he now argues

that a payment made to him in July 1970, in the amount of

$20,000 and which he used as a downpayment on a house, was

the

fulfillment of this additional commitment and not part

of the $50,000 he was promised for his two years in place.

This despite the fact that in the 14 August 1972 memorandum

as MI. Solle states in paragraph 5, •

considers that the assistance in purchasing furniture, a

house, etc., which he has been given since 1969 should be

considered as cancelling the matter of the $50,000.

4.

What seems to have occurred is a change of position

on PDDONOR's part.

While previously acknowledging that the

original $50,000 commitment had been met (paragraph 5 of

Reference B) PDDONOR now takes the position that of the

below listed payments

only $30,000

should be applied against

the $50,000 commitment.

The July 1970 payment of $20,000

should be applied against a separate commitment to provide

assistance in purchasing a home.

In addition, the issue

of the $20,000 he says is still owed him does not surface in

the file until September 1978, 14 years after his defection.

The explanation of why this issue would

arise at this late

date is not clear from available records.

6. Attached are copies of those documents which impact

on this issue.

Because of the complexities of this case I

recommend that we request the Office of General Counsel to

review the entire case and provide a ruling on the legitimacy

of PDDONOR's claim of $20,000. After such a ruling we can

discuss our future course of action.

1. On 3 February 1970, the undersigned discussed with the

Subject certain personal matters which are or could be problems in

the future and which should be given appropriate consideration in the

• near future. Jerry Brown/SRS was also present and it is expected

will assist in the future in many of the routine handling problems

which could or will arise.

2. This memorandum is intended to present an up-to-date

report of the current situation in Subject case for any current action

or possible future action.

3. Subject is presently residing with wife at his previous

address. There do not appear to be any particular domestic problems.

The wife of Subject is six years older than Subject, but Subject was

well aware of this at the time of his marriage. Numerous comments

by Subject indicate that he is attached to the family of his wife and in

the opinion of the undersigned, the Subject is accepted as a member

continued and will continue to ignore any previous promises to Subject

in any discussions with Subject.

20. As indicated above, a complete list of promises made

to Subject in 1964 is not available and for purposes of consideration

of whether Subject should be given some additional financial assist-

ance are not reguired. It is probably sufficient to list certain known

promises made to Subject on 30 January 1964 with the specification

that they had been approved by Mr. Helms. These promises included:

(a) $50, 000 deposited in a personal account for

Subject.

(b) At least $10, 000 additional for the information

on VASSALL.

(c) Placing Subject under contract for $25,000

per year for an indefinite period - 5 years - 10 years -

with built-in provisions for retirement and other benefits

to make up for the career Subject "was giving up. "

(d) Provision for living quarters. On 30 January

1964, Subject, during the discussion prior to his de-

fection,

stated he would "arrive with what I have on my

back - no horne - no roof - no anything. " The reply to

Subject following the above statement was that,

"This

will be taken care of. It will be provided. " Perhaps

this reply to Subject cannot be interpreted by a person

other than Subject as a promise of a house, but it can

be construed as a promise of something and there may

have been other discussions with Subject in regard to

housing in the United States.

21. Attached to the original of this memorandum are the

• following basic documents:

(a) Copy of "quit claim" which was signed by

Subject in true name in April 1969 and notarized.

This particular document was actually entitled,

"Undertaking Regarding Obligations and Secrecy, "

and referred to "current arrangements, " (separate

contract) so that there was some actual value re-

ceived by Subject for the "quit claim."

(b) Copy of contract which was signed by Subject

in true name in April 1969 with effective date of

1 March 1969. This particular document is a separate

document in that it does not make reference to the

separate "quit claim" but does contain a "Secrecy

Retreat

DCISRE

DATE: 14 August 1972

1. On 7 August 1972 following a discussion of several items

of intelligence interest, NOSENKO mentioned the matter of the proposed

book, stating that he doubted it would sell a large number of copies.

Reason for this opinion, according to NOSENKO, was that he realized

the information was over eight years old and it was not in the form of

a "spy thriller. " He thought that the majority of readers who would be

. attracted would be those who had an actual interest in the KGB and its

effect on Soviet life rather than individuals interested in entertaining

reading.

2. NOSENKO then stated there was something he hesitated

to bring up, that he had hoped it would have been mentioned previously

by the undersigned and that he hoped his mention of it would not be mis-

construed. NOSENKO then stated that the matter was the salary to

which he considered he was entitled for the period of five years (April

1964 - 1 March 1969). The latter date is the date the current con-

tractual relationship with NOSENKO became effective.

3. NOSENKO stated that he is very grateful for what has

been done for him since 1969 and that he has no animosity for what

occurred previously even though it was "five years from his life."

NOSENKO stated that he considered he is living very well although not

saving any money for the future. He stated that he had hoped to obtain

some extra money from the sale of a book but now doubts sufficient

copies will be sold for him to realize any sizable amount from royalties.

However, he is vitally interested in the book (or books) being published

since it, in his opinion, would "hurt the KGB. "

4. By way of background on the topic of the "five years, "

NOSENKO stated that prior to his defection in Geneva, he discussed

his future with BAGLEY and made three requests, these being:

(a) Employment at $25.000 per year;

(b) $50,000. 00 in savings account;

(c) Assistance in purchasing a house.

According to NOSENKO, BAGLEY, a day or two later, informed

NOSENKO that his requests had been approved and NOSENKO considers

this constituted a valid verbal contract.

5. NOSENKO stated that in February-March 1964 he received

• a salary at the rate of $25, 000. 00 per year and he believes he also re-

ceived $5, 000.00 of the $50, 000.00. NOSENKO also considers that

the assistance in purchasing furniture, a house, etc., which he has been

given since 1969 should be considered

as canceling the matter of the

$50, 000. 00.

6. The matter which does concern NOSENKO is the salary,

less income tax, for the "five years" to which NOSENKO considers he

is entitled under the verbal agreement with BAGLEY in early 1962.

Since 1 March 1969, NOSENKO has not received $25, 000. 00 per annum

but this is not a point of discussion since he is very grateful for the

assistance which has been given to him during that time.

7. According to NOSENKO, he recognizes that if he had re-

ceived the salary for the "five years" under normal circumstances he

probably would have spent all of it. However, since his inability to

receive and spend the money was not of choice, he feels that he should

be entitled to the salary which he would have received. NOSENKO

stated he would invest any money he received and would use it to provide

for the future since he now has a wife and family responsibilities.

8. The reply of the undersigned to NOSENKO was that the

above would be brought to the attention of the appropriate officials. An
