Re Miami letter to Bureau, 4/27/62.

The Christian Anti-Communist Front (CACF) formerly

maintained an office in the NY area at the San Rafael

Hotel but this office has been closed for many months due

, to inactivity, and the fact that the head of the CACE, LUIS

CONTE ACUERO,

has been residing in Miami, Florida.

FELLERE

DI. ERNESTO ARAGON, secretary. to Dr. JOSE MIRO

CARDONA, President of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC),

on May 10, 1962, that the CACF is no longer active

in the NY area and whatever activity there is in this or-

?, the Miami, Florida, area.

ARAGON further advised on 5/10/62, that as he

previously related, CONTE AGUERO left the CRC in February,

1902, shortly after the Foreign Ministers Meeting held in

Punta del Este, Uruguay, during late January, 1962. ARAGON

stated that in various countries in which CONTE AGUERO

went prior to arriving in Uruguay, he created scandals be-

cause of his personal escapades and was instructed to re-

turn directly to Miami after his speech in Montevideo, Uruguay.
