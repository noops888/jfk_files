ADMINISTRATIVE:

on 9/20/68, HO 1251-PC advised SA ALFRED G. GUNN

that CARLOS MARCELLO

is still convinced after having been

convicted and sentenced that he will be able to get the

assault case thrown out on appeal. After his sentence, he

After he e

made some personal comments that he thought the

FBI Agent

had been very fair in the trial in two ways:

1.

Because he insisted that MARCELLO did not

hit him even though some other witnesses

said

otherwise, and

2.

Because he brought

up the word "Mafia"

which almost caused

a retrial and is the

basis for appeal.

MARCELLO has also stated that his prosecution on

this charge was because of politics and because some people

in the Government have a personal animosity toward

him.

Informant advised that he is still unaware of any

business interests that MARCELLO might have in this area.
