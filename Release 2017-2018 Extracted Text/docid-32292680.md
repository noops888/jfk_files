EXPLOSION IN ENGINE ROOM

OF BRITISH FREIGHTER "GRANWOOD"

on May 20, 1968, Lieutenant Commander D. F. Smith,

U.S.

Coast Guard, Mobile,

Alabama, advised that he examined

the damage

to the

"Granwood" which

was

then dry-docked

at Mobile, Alabama.

Commander Smith advised that the damage

appeared to be caused by an explosion from outside the

ship near a grate through which water was being pumped

to cool the engines.

He stated that the explosion was

definitely from outside the ship and was of such force to

raise the deck of the engine room approximately four inches.

The "Miami News" of June 1, 1968,

carried an

article which stated, "Cuban Power,

an exile terrorist

organization based in Miami, claimed today it was responsible

for bombing a Japanese freighter yesterday at a Tampa dock,

and a British ship off Key West.

"A spokesman identified only as Ernesto, added

that 'other ships are going to explode."

He said Cuban

Power is warring against trade with Cuba."

The basis for this

article was a telephone cal

received by the Associated Press at Miami, Florida,

from

an individual who identified himself only as "Ernesto of

Cuban Power."

Investigation has failed to develop any suspects

in connection with this matter and investigation is con-

tinuing by this organization in an effort to attempt to

identify any suspects in connection with this bombing and

to determine the validity of the claim by "Cuban Power" at

Miami that it was responsible for the bombing.
