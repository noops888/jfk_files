It is known that the. Mexican Foreign Minister was obviously

disturbed by the knowledge of the note sent by the Cuban

Government to the Mexican Government attributing to it partici-

pation in a plot aimed at involving the CASTRO Government int

the plan for the attack on KENNEDY:.

Because of this,' it is

felt that there may be a change in the well?known Mexican

position toward the Cuban problem.
