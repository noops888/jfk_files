from the VA Hospital in Kansas City, he has had a past history

of commitments to mental institutions and it is felt that he

will probably require additional hospitalization and treatment

in the future.

In view of the foregoing, NY has opened a 105-

Contact case on HARBER for the purposes of ascertaining the

degree of association between HARBER and KOVALEV in the past/S

and to determine if this association has continued to the

present time. NY is also interested in ascertaining if

HARBER has any potential as a double agent. (5)

The following investigation has been conducted:

On 11/18/59, Mr. JOSE MANOS, Assistant Director,

Berlitz School of Languages, 40 W. 51st St., NYC, made

available HARBER's employment record. It reflected that

HARBER first went to work for the Berlitz School as an English

Instructor on 1/5/55. He worked at irregular intervals

3662/393

thereafter, his last period of employment being from March, 1958,

to 6/26/58. His application for employment reflected that he

was born on 11/20/27, in the US, that his residence address

in 1955 was 319 W. 14th St., NYC, and his Social Security

This application further

reflected that HARBER was at one time in the US Army (dates

and ASN not shown), and served in US occupation forces in

Germany and Italy.

It still further revealed that HARBER

attended the University of Wisconsin (dates and field of

study not shown) and was formerly employed as an Instructor

at the Boys Industrial School at Topeka, Kansas (period

not reflected).

At the conclusion of the 11/18/59, interview, JOSE

"MANOS advised that the Berlitz School had on several occasions

since June, 1958, tried to get in touch with HARBER, to

ascertain if he wanted to teach courses; but they had been

unsuccesful, even though he had left a telephone number

with them,

namely CHelsea 3-7208.

According to MANOS, an

individual' who identified himself

as AMERICO had answered

the telephone each time they called advising that HARBER

was out of the city.
