EMBASSY UNDERSTOOD THAT LEGISLATIVE MANDATE FOR ARRB HAD

EXPIRED IN FALL 1997, SO DID NOT FOLLOWUP FURTHER.

HOWEVER, MANDATE

WAS APPARENTLY EXTENDED TO FALL 1998, AND ARRB'S INTEREST IN BKGB

INFORMATION HAS BEEN REACTIVATED.

ARRB TEAM MAY WISH TO COME TO

MINSK TO TRY AGAIN TO OBTAIN THESE RECORDS FROM BKGB, OR AT LEAST GET

EMBASSY TO REVITALIZE EFFORTS TO DO SO.
