MEXICO CITY 7800, 24 October 1968

On 6 November 1968, LITEMPQ12 was requested to provide

Information on Subject's present whereabouts and status.

LITEMPO 12

reported on il November that Subject is living in IDEN D. She 1a

the personal "contact" of LITEMPO-4 and her hotel bills are being

pald by the DFS.

She was used as the "link" between IDEN C and

the students,

and apparently continues to maintain a close relationship

WIth IDEN C, in whom the Mexicau Government has a continued interest..

The above information is the most recent avatlable to the

Station concerning Subject... Due to the sensitivity of the case, at

this time the Station is reluctant to go back to the LITEMPO g unless

directed to do so by Headquarters.

The Station will. keep abreast

of the casa and advise Headquarters of any new developments.

3.

The Station requests that IDIN B only be provided with

information published overtly in the press concerning Subject's

activities.
