jeopardizing this operation.

A preliminary discussion concerning this matter was held

with Austin Horn, CIA, on 9/6/63, at which time Horn stated it would

be necessary to confer with certain CIA officials.

On 9/12/63, the

Liaison Agent met with Al Rodriguez and as a result of the discussion

beld, Rodriguez made the following statements:

* (4)

1. CIA believes that subject's trip to BraZil could

FORICATIRO CONTAINRO

be worthwhile and there appears to be nothing to

lose.

CIA believes that the chances of promoting

ASSIFIED

a defection of Roa, Jr., are slim but the subject

SHOWE

possibly could develop information of interest.(PU)

2.

If the subject travels to Brazil, CIA would like

to brief him prior to his departure. If subject

â€¢??;".

WISE

so desires, CIA will brief him in Washington, D.C.,

and the Agency will be willing to pay his traveling

expenses from Salt Lake City to Washington, D.C.

These expenses would also cover his return trip

to

Salt Lake City in the event subject found it necessary

to return to Utah prior to his departure for Brazil.
