This morning FRID GILLIES, reporter for the

"Denver Post," Denver daily newspaper, telephonically?

contacted the Denver Office. C

(By way of background GILLIES has written

articles which have appeared in the "Denver Post" con-

cerning the so-called mysterious disappearance of THOMAS

RIHA.

RInA, a naturalized American citizen of Czech birth,

was a History Professor at Colorado University in Boulder,

Colorado.

He disappeared in March, 1969.

GILLIES spoke to ASAC JOHN F. MORLEY in the

absence of the SAC.

He said he had a copy of a letter which,

the Bureau had written to the Honorable DONALD BROTZMAN

concerning the RIHA mattes, which was a letter in reply

to an inquiry directed to the Bureau by BROTZMAN.

The Bureau had previously furnished the Denver

Office a copy of its 1/15/70, letter to BROTZMAN, as well

a copy of BROIZMAN's 1/8/70, letter to the Attorney

) General, and those letters had been read by MORLEY upon

GILLIES then told MORLEY the reason he was calling

was to obtain the FBi's comments in Denver concerning the

letter.

MORLEY advised CLLICS the letter was very clear and

self-explanatory and no further comment was necessary.

The above is being brought to the attention of

the Bureau for completion of their tilee and also so the

Bureau will know a copy of their communication was forwarded

to GILLIES of the

"Denver Post" by BROTZMAN.

BROTZMAN, a current U. S. Republican Congressman

From Colorado, is

a former U. S. Attornsy here in Denver.

ocal indications are BROILMAN will run for re-alaction this

year and the

"Denver Post" is the largest publication in

Colorado. Also BROTZMAN is a

resident of Boulder, Colorado,

where he maintains a law practice.

RIlis, the subject of

his inquiry,

was also a resident of boulder, and, as 1hd1Cateœ

above, associated with the Colorado University faculty there.

Denver is conducting no investigation in subject

matter.

The above is submitted

for the Bureau's information.

reflective of the lack of concorn and bureaucratic inepti

In an age of repudiation of the fundanental moral

imperative that the truts be uncovered no

Washington, D.C. 20535

Dear Mr. Hoover:

Thank you very much for your letter of March 19, 1970

with reference to the disappearance of Professor Thomas Riha.

Since I am not aware of the extent of the jurisdiction

of the Federal bureau of Investigation, I am unable to provide

any information which will allow investigation of the dis-

appearance by the FBI. The only basis which may permit action

by the FBI appears to be Professor Riha's status as a recipient

of funds from the Office of Education of the Department of

Education and Welfare under the provisions of the

National Defense Education Act at the time of his disappearance.

in March 1969. Whether the receipt of monies from a Federal

PRO

agency constitutes a legal relationship with the Federal

Government which would fall within the jurisdiction of such

Federal agencies as the FBI is unknown to me but, conceivably,

it would provide a rationale for participation in the case by

the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

doctors,

she

whiled away the hours by taking a fling

at fine art.

The pictures she turned

out ivere

considered good enough to be exhibited

in the highly prestigious Miller Stock-

mar. Galleries. They consisted of water

colors and acrylics,

a paint that looks •

like oil paint but dries faster.

Denver Post art critic Rena Andrews

viewed

them

and

reported

that

the

acrylies were close to the works of the

German expiessiorists but that

Galya

"uses very sunny colors like Van Gogh."

The artist had "a disturbing technique"

in that it appeared she ran

a comb

through the paint, leaving ridges, but

for all that she seemed to have genuine

talent.

The

exhibit

drew

wide

interest,

partly, to be sure, because of the notor-

surrounding the artist and, at

a throw,

the paintings were repo sto

selling well. Indeed, the gallery has re-

quested that Galya

paintings

turn in some more

with the hint that the price

may be upped.

This

leads

to the reasonable conclu-

sion

that if Galya

beats the charges

against her, she may be launched on a

new career, porhaps eren more lucrative

MEMORANCU

On nuesday:

Airs, Galya lannenbaum in my office at my request.

Inis visti was i connectioi

• •With the deportation and divorce matter in thich I was representing irs. Hana

Riha.

/

It had been my understanding prior to this visit that Mrs. Riha was being

assisted by hirs. Tannenbalim with regard to her immigration status and other

matters.

Based upon my conversations with Mrs. Riha and her aunt and uncle, re

and Mrs. Grossman, prior to my visit with lirs. Tannenbaum, Mrs. Tannenbaum was

apparently exerting a substantial amount of pressure on Mrs. Riha and had

indicated to them that she had some official position in the Government.

Mrs.

Tannenbaum, at the meeting in my office, told me that she was with

MI 4, which I asked her to explain.

she indicated that Mi 4 was the Military

Intelligence Division of the Army in this District.

she had bean associated wich Military Intelligence for 2 urans su that hea

of her connections in Military Intelligence she had many friends in the Justic.

Department and in the Immigration service, whom she nad been contacting in ar

effort to assist Mrs. Riha.

She further stated that she had obtained firs. Rita's

immigration file and that at that time she had possession of the file. She

appeared to be knowledgeable concerning the various immigration laws.

She statec

that there were certair documents which Hana must file.

She also mentioned that

because her position in Military Intelligence enabled her to arrange for the

Postoffice Department to place an earlier postmark date on some correspondence

which Hana had filed after the time for filing the documents had expired.

I stated to her that I thought it was appropriates in order to protece my

client, to ask her to produce certain credentials or identification.

She states

she did not have any identification with ner, that she did nave a plasite car

which identified her with Military Intelligence, and that sne would see that 1

received a proper identification card a our next meeting.

We had no further

meetings and that was the only direct contact which i had with Mrs. Tannenbaum

other than some telephone calls; which I believe preceded the office visit.

ceived a reduction in the $2.500 bond set after

her arrest last week for allegedly forging the

name of tha missing University of Colorado pro-

fessör to a check last July 30.

rs Tannenbaum, about 50, is a key figure

in a swirl of discussion and speculation over the

health and location of Riha.

He is the associate professor of Russian his:

tory who disappeared from CU March 17, 1969.

She has claimed to be the Czechoslovakian na-

tire's confidant and has said Riha will soon re-

turn to the Denver area. Other persons fear

Riha is dead.

Bail was recluced to $1,000 by Boulder Dist.

Judge Howard O. Ashton after receiving a mo

tion filed by John Kokish, a lawyer from Denver

who is representing Mrs. Tannenbaum.

Kekish also asked, the bond to led tempo

rary one lasting until Feb. 4, to allow Mrs.

Tannenbaum to arrange her personal affairs.

The lawyer said the free time is necessary

because extensive litigation in this

case and

others is expected.

Mrs. Tannenbaum pleaded innocent by rea-

son of insanity last Thursday to a charge of for-

gery involving the will of another acquaintance

of hers, the late Gustav Frederick Ingwersen,

of 1431 Forest St., who died June 18, 1969.

nied a request for Mrs. Tannenbaum's release

from Asst. Dist. Atly.

"She sould like to get her children (she has

RE: GALYA TANNENBAUM

Paul Morris, Attorney, Woolworth Building, Boulder,

Colorado, advised on January 28, 1970 that Galya Tannenbaum

had been

introduced to him in June, 1968 by another Boulder

attorney, Dennis Blewitt.

At this

time he stated Blewitt and

others were interested in the Lake Valley Home Owners Associa-

tion and

were attempting to secure financing of a one million

dollar ($1,000, 000) loan.

Morris stated that Tannenbaum had

indicated to Blewiit that she could obtain such a loan for the

Association and as a result certain paynents were made to her

for alleged expenses.

Morris stated that Tannenbaum had statec

that she would be able to secure the loan through the Federal

Housing Administration (FHA) and that she seemed to be quite

well informed on financial matters.

we the foot tanent had noted

He recalled that during

the summer of 1968 Tannenbaum had been successful in obtaining

a preliminary approval of an FHA loan for the Association;

however, it was never finalized.

Morris

stated that several months after the FHA

through he had occasion to contact Tannenbaum

further and at this time Tannenbaum made representations to

a Colonel in the United States Military

Intelligence and had connections with the office of the United

States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Morris

stated although he was somewhat skeptical concerning

Tannenbaum's military connections, she did appear well versed

in innigration

matters.

He stated, however, at no time during

his dealings with her had she ever obtained

anything from him

on through him as a result of her representations.

Dennis Blewitt, Attorney, 1966 13th Street, Boulder,

coLorado, was

interviewed on February 3, 1970 and furnished

substantially the same intormation as attorney Morris con-

cerning Tannenbaum's affiliation with the Lake Valley Home

Owners

Association and Tannenbaum's efforts to obtain an FHA

loan for this association.

Blewitt stated after it became

apparent Tannenbaum could not secure the loan from the FHA

and that he had not actually believed she had any affiliation

with such military agencies of the United States Governnent.

Mrs. Francisca Stein, owner of the Black Bear Inn,

Lyons, Colorado, advised on January 21, 1970 that she had met

Galya

l'annenbaum through her attorney, Paul Morris, Boulder.

Colorado, and had seen her on several

occasions when Tannenbaun

been introduced to her by Morris as one who might be able to

assist her in getting Zdenek Cerveny, a nephew of Thomas Riha,

admitted into the United States.

Mrs. Stein said that on one

Colonel in the Military Intelligence and was soon to be pro-

moted to the rank of General.

Tannenbaum also told Mrs. Stein

that she at one tine had belonged to an extermination group

which killed people.

Mrs. Stein said in view of this and

other similar wild

statements made by Tannenbaum, she soon

formed the opinion that Tannenbaum was not a truthful indivi-

dual and did not believe any statements made by her.

Mrs. Hana

Riha, wife of Thomas Riha, was interviewed

at the residence of Rose

Grossman, 240 Bast 18th Street

Brooklyn, New York, on Januany 28, 1970. Mrs. Riha advised

had first met Galya Tannenbaum

on the occasion of

her marriage October 13, 1968 to Thomas Riha:

She said follow

residence in Boulder approximately twice a week until February,

1969. On several of these occasions Tannenbaum made statements

to Mrs. Riha indicating she was working for the United States

Army and expected to be promoted to the rank of General.

Riha said that Tannenbaum also claimed to have connections

specific as to the nature of her affiliation.

Tannenbaum

claimed to have lived in Russia during World War II.

Mys.

Riha said that she became tired of Mrs. Tannenbaum's inces-

sant talking and had as little to do with her as possible.

Mr. Zdenek Cerveny, a nephew of Thomas Riha, was

interviewed

at the Black Bear Inn, Lyons, Colorado, on

January 21, 1970 and advised that he has

known Galy, Tannenbaum

since his arrival in the United States from Czechoslovakia.

He stated Mrs. Tannenbaum met him at the bus depot in Denver

upon his arrival November 16, 1968.

She drove him to the

residence of his uncle, Thomas Riha, 1055 6th Street, Boulder.

had been influential in getting him into the United States.

i said he resided with Thomas Riha and wife Hana until January 8,

1369 and during this period Mrs. Tannenbaum had

visited in the

nina house on many occasions.

He recalled Mrs. Tannenbaum had

made numerous statements claiming to be either an officer in

lilitary Intelligence or influential with authorities of the

United States Immigration and Naturalization Service and had

indicated on one occasion that if he did not behave, she would

have him sent back to Czechoslovakia.

Cenveny

stated Tannenbaum accompanied him to the

Federal Building in Denver once when he had to go to the office

of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

He said that

Tannenbaum refused to go with him into the office, however,

and remained outside. Cerveny advised that at no

time did

Tannenbaun ever obtain anything from him as a result of her

representations of affiliation with governmental agencies.

Rose Grossman, 240 East 18th Street, Brooklyn, New

wedding of Thomas Riha and wife Hana in Colorado in October,

1968. She stated she is an aunt of Hana Riha.

Mr's .

Grossman said she heard of Mrs. Tannenbaum but did not

actually meet her.

She said the first she had spoken to Mrs.

Tannenbaum had been by telephone from New York about March,

also told

Mrs. Grossman she was a Colonel in the Pentagon Military

Intelligence, Washington, D. C.

Mrs. Grossman said her hus

band, who had

accompanied her to Boulder, asked Mrs. Lannendaum

if she worked fon the Military Intelligence in Washington, and

Mrs. Tannenbaum said that a smart person would not ask such

questions.

According to Mrs. Grossman, this conversation left

her with the impression that Tannenbaum had some type of con-

nection with the United States Government; however, she never

exhibited any identification as such.

vised on January 23, 1970 that he had met Galya lannenbaum on

two occasions through Thomas Riha, a personal friend. Havlicek

said that Riha on a number of occasions had referred to Mrs.

Tannenbaum as the "Colonel" and had indicated she had influ

ential Government connections.

He stated, however, that Mrs.

Tannenbaum had never made any such statements to him,

and he

had no knowledge of her ever having claimed to be affiliated

with an agency of the United States

Government.

Stephen Fischer-Galati, Professor, Department of

History, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, advised

on January 26, 1970 that he first met Galya Tannenbaum in May,

1969, when he

began making inquiries of individuals he had

reason to belleve might have intormation concerning the dis-

appearance of Professor Thomas Riha.

He said that Mrs.

Tannenbaum had told him she had known Thomas Riha for many

years and had indicated to him that she helped Riha come to

the United States and gave no further explanation.

Fischer-

Galati advised that he had heard from unrecalled sources that

Tannenbaum claimed to be a Colonel in Military Intelligence.

He said after several conversations with her; however, ne

became convinced she was not connected with any type Incelli-

gence work and was not connected with Eastern European history.

He stated Tannenbaum was extremely careful in her conversations

with him and made no statements concerning affiliation with any

intelligence or governmental agency.

David Regosin, Attorney, 30 Broad Street, New York,

New York, advised on January 23, 1970 that he is attorney for

Mr. Regosin

stated his only contact with Galya lannenbaum had been on or

about March 8, 1969 when he received a telephone call, allegeaty

fcom Mrs. Tannenbaum, who said she was calling from Colorado.

Mr. Regosin said this person indicated she was taking care of

the immigration problems of Hana Riha and she was not "going

out on a limb any more." Tannenbaum during

• this conversation

appeared to be screaming and hysterical.

Mr, Regosin stated

she did not directly represent to Mr. Regosin that she was an

officer or employee of the United States Government.

Mr. Bill Wade, Chief Underwriter,

Federal Housing

Administration (FHA), Denver, Colorado, advised on February 2,

and registered a formal complaint against the Denver FHA

She also wrote a letter of complaint to FHA in

Judge BARNARD's secretary, this morning since Judge BARNARD

was again in court hearing the sanity matter involving Mrs.

TANNENBAUM.

When contaded by the Bureau Agent Mrs. DONNELLEY

stated when the Judge heard that comment of alleged Bureau

employment by Mrs. TANNENBAUM he immediately discounted it

knowing it was absolutely untrue.

Mrs. DONNELLEY stated she would bring the FBI

refutation of this comment to the Judge's attention at the

first recess in court.

Various criminal proceedings are pending against

Mrs. TANNENBAUM in the Denver-Boulder area, and they are

being held in abeyance, pending the outcome of her current

sanity trial.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

Thank you very much for your letter of March 19, 1870

with reference to the disappearance of Professor Thomas Riha.

Since I am not aware of the extent of the jurisdiction

of the federal Bureau of Investigation, 1 am unable to provide

any information which will allow investigation of the dis

appearance by the FBI. The only basis which may permit action

by the FBI appears to be Professor Riha's status as a recipient

of funds from the Office of Education of the Denartment of

Health, Education and Welfare under the provisions of the

National Defense

Education Act at the time of his disappearance

in March 1959•

Whether the receipt of monies from a Federal

agency constitutes a legal relationship with the Federal

Government which would fall within the jurisdiction of such

Federal agencies as the FBI is unknown to me but, conceivably,

it would provide a rationale for participation in the case by

the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

As previously

1969 forgery of the will of a deceased individual, and she is

on $1500 bond on this charge. TANNENBAUM is also free

THOMAS RIHA to a $330 check.

This forgery allegedly occurred

in July, 1969, some four and a half months after the mysterious

disappearance of THOMAS RIHA, Professor of History, University

there is no evidence relating to his disappearance showing any

violation of Federal law over

which this Bureau has jurisdiction.

The circumstances of his disappearance

suggest a missing person

situation and that investigation is being handled by the Boulder

Police Department.

Because of the close personal relationship between

TANNENBAUM and RIHA, It would be possible, without the above

statenent by Interviewing Agents, that Interviewees could gain

the impression the FBl is Investigating the disappearance 11

stead of the impersonation of a Federal officer by TANNENBAUM.

Pursuant to current Bureau instructions, this office

is not and has not conducted any investigation concerning RIHA.

Interviews of additional sources in captioned natter

have been for the purpose of clarifying additional statements

allegedly made by subject TANNeNBAUM regarding her afrillation

Military Intelligence.

In this connection all

have been interviowed and the results of these interviews dis

cussed exhaustively with the Assistant U.S. Attorney in Denver,

Colorado, having jurisdiction in this matter, and prosecution

has been declined. The Assistant U. S. Atiorney in Denver does

not feel there is

any possibility of prosecuting subject

TANNENBAUM regarding these false statements under the Federal

Impersonation Statute.

In view of this tact, no further investi

GALYA TANNENBAUM

IMPERSONATION MATTER

Robert Duane Gaines,

Pilot, Judson Flying Service,

Longmont, Colorado, was interviewed at Font Worth, Texas, on

January 27, 1970, and stated Galya Tannenbaum had telephoned

him at the Longmont Airport in July, 1969, inquiring about the

price of chartering an airplane to fly to San Antonio, Texas,

and back.

Gaines stated Tannenbaum told him over the

telephone

that she was a Secret Service Agent with the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA). She also stated she worked closely with the Federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Gaines stated he had quoted a

price of $330 for the round trip charter.

Gaines stated that

Tannenbaum called him later and accepted his offer. He stated

he subsequently picked up Tannenbaum and one Zenek Cerveny at

Stapleton Airport, Denver, and flew them to San

Antonio, texas.

Gaines stated that during

the trip to San Antonio and back

Tannenbaum talked at great length about her affiliations with

various Government agencies, including the Secret Service and

CIA.

Gaines stated Tannenbaum told him that the Government

would pay for her trip.to San Antonio; however, when they

arrived back at Stapleton Airport in Denver, Tannenbaum pre-

sented him with a check which she took from her purse and which

was completely filled out in the sum of $330. The check was

already signed with the maker's name Thomas Riha.

Gaines stated that at no time did he actually believe

that Galya Tannenbaum was affiliated with the Secret Service,

CIA, or any other Government agency. He said that her state-

ments to this effect did not influence him either in providing

the air transportation or in accepting the Riha check in pay-

ment. He said that he would have handled the transaction in

exactly the same manner regardless of statements made by her

RE: GALYA TANNENBAUM

Paul Morris, Attorney, Woolworth Building, Boulder,

Colorado, advised on January 28, 1970 that Galya l'annenbaum

had been

introduced to him in June, 1968 by another Boulder

attorney, Dennis Blewitt. At this

time he stated Blewitt and

others were interested in the Lake Valley Home Owners Associan

tion and were attempting to secure financing of a one million

dollar ($1,000,000) loan. Morris stated

that Tannenbaun had

indicated to Blewitt that she could obtain such a loan for the

Association and as a result certain payments were made to her

that she would be able to secure the loan through the federal

Housing Adninistration (FHA) and that she seemed to be quite

well informed on financial matters.

He recalled that during

the summer ot 1968 Tannenbaum had been successiu in obtaining

a preliminary approval of an FHA loan for the Association;

however, it was

never

• finalized.

Morris stated that several months after the FHA

negotiations fell through he had occasion to contact Tannenbaum

further and at this time Tannenbaum made representations to

him that she was

a Colonel in the United States Military

Intelligence and had connections with the office of the United

States Inmigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Morris

stated although he was somewhat skeptical concerning

Tannenbaum's military connections, she did appear well versed

in immigration matters.

He stated, however, at no time during

his dealings with her had she ever obtained

anything from him

or through him as a result of her representations.

Dennis Blewitt, Attorney, 1966 13th Street, Boulder,

Colorado, was interviewed on February 3, 1970 and furnished

substantially the same information as attorney Morris con

cerning Tannenbaum's affiliation with the Lake Valley Home

Owners Association and Tannenbaum's efforts to obtain an FHA

loan for this association. Blewitt stated after it became

apparent Tannenbaum could not secure the loan from the FHA

she was advised by the Association that her services were no

longer required.

He recalled at this time that Tannenbaum

on one occasion

had claimed affiliation in some manner with

Military Intelligence and on another occasion had stated she

instructor at the United States Air force Academy,

Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Blewitt stated by this time as

a result of his

associations with Tannenbaum, he had formed

the personal opinion that Tannenbaum was not

a truthful person

RE: GALYA TANNENBAUM

and that he had not actually believed she had any affiliation

with such military agencies of the United States Government.

Mrs. Francisca Stein, owner of the Black Bear Inn,

Lyons, Colorado, advised on January 21, 1970 that she had met

Galya Tannenbaun through her attorney, Paul

Morris, Boulder,

Colorado, and had

seen her on several

occasions when lannenbaum

visited the Black Bear Inn.

Mrs. Stein stated Tannenbaum had

been introduced to her by Morris as one who might be able to

assist her in getting wdenek Cerveny, a nephew of Thomas Riha,

admitted into the United States. Mrs. Stein said that on one

occasion Tannenbaum made a statement to her that she was a

Colonel in the Military Intelligence and was soon to be pro-

moted to the rank of General.

that she at one time had belonged to an extermination group

which killed people.

Mrs. Stein said in view of this and

other similar wild

statenents made by Tannenbaum, she soon

formed the opinion that Tannenbaum was not a truthful indivi

dual and did not believe any statements made by her.

Mrs. Hana Riha, wife of Thomas Riha, was interviewed

at the residence of Rose

Grossman, 240

East 18th Street

Brooklyn, New York, on January 28, 1970. Mrs. Riha advísed

that she

had first

met Galya Tannenbaum on the occasion of

her marriage October 13, 1968 to Thomas Riha.

She said follow-

her marriage to Riha, Tannenbaum had visited at their

residence in Boulder approximately twice a week until February,

1969.

On several of these occasions Tannenbaum made statements

to Mrs. Riha indicating she was working for the United States

Army and expected to be promoted to the rank of General. Mrs.

Riha said that Tannenbaum also claimed to have connections

with the Immigration and Naturalization Service but was not

specific as to the nature of her affiliation.

Tannenbaum

claimed to have lived in Russia during World

War Il.

Riha said that she became tired of Mrs. Tannenbaum's inces-

sant talking and had as little to do with her as possible.

Mr. Zdenek Cerveny, a nephew of Thomas Riha, was

interviewed at the Black Bear Inn, Lyons, Colorado, on

January

21, 1970 and advised that

he has known Galy, Tannenbaum

since his

arrival in the United

• States from Czechoslovakia.

He stated Mes. Tannenbaum met him at the bus depot in Denver

upon his arrival November 16, 1968.

She drove him to the

residence of his uncle, Thomas Riha, 1055 6th Street, Boulder.

RE: GALYA TANNENBAUM

Mr. Cerveny said that he had been told by his uncle, Thomas

Kiha, that lirs. Tannenbaum was a very important person and

had been influential in getting him into the United States.

He said he resided with Thomas

Riha and wife Hana until January 8,

1969 and during this period Mrs. Tannenbaum had visited in the

Rina house on many occasions.

made numerous statements claiming to be either an officer in

Military Intelligence or influential with authorities of the

United States Immigration and Naturalization Service and had

indicated on one occasion that if he did not behave, she would

have him sent back to Czechoslovakia.

Cerveny

stated Tannenbaum accompanied him to the

Federal Building in Denver once when he had to go to the office

of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

He said that

Tannenbaum refused to go with him into the office, however,

and remained outside. Cerveny advised that at no

time did

Tannenbaum ever obtain anything from him as a result of her

representations of affiliation with governmental agencies.

Rose Grossman, 240 East 18th Street, Brooklyn, New

York, advised on January 27, 1970. that she had attended

the

wedding of Thomas Riha and wife Hana in Colorado in October,

1968.

She stated she is an aunt of Hana Riha. At the wedding

Grossman

said she heard of Mrs.

Tannenbaum but did not

actually meet her.

She said the first she had spoken to Mrs.

Tannenbaum had been by telephone from New York about March,

Later she said she went to Boulder, Colorado, and Mrs.

status.

Mrs. Tannenbaum claimed to have influential friends

at the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

She

also told

Mrs. Grossman she was a Colonel in the Pentagon Military

Intelligence, Washington, D. C.

Mrs. Grossman said her hus

and, who had accompanied her to Boulder, asked Mrs. Tannenbaum

if she worked for the Military Intelligence in Washington, and

Mrs. Tannenbaum said that a smart person would not ask such

questions.

According to Mrs. Grossman, this conversation left

her with the impression that Tannenbaum had some type of con-

nection with the United States Government; however, she

never

exhibited any identification as such.

RE: GALYA TANNENBAUM

Vaclav Havlicek, owner of a business known as Fasco,

located in the Denver Merchandise Mart, Denver, Colorado, ad-

vised on January 23, 1970 that he

had met Galya Tannenbaum on

two occasions through Thomas Riha, a personal friend.

Havlicek

said that Riha on a number of occasions had referred to Mrs.

Tannenbaum as the "Colonel"

and had indicated she had influ

ential Government connections.

He stated, however

Carnenbaum had naver nade any such statements to hun that Mrs.

had no knowledge of her ever having claimed to be affiliated

with an agency of the United States Government.

Stephen Fischer-Galati, Professor, Depantment

History, University of Colorado,

Boulder, Colorado, advised

on January 26, 1970 that he

met Galya Tannenbaum

in May,

1969, when he began making inquiries of individuals he had

reason to believe might have information concerning the dis-

appearance of Professor Thomas

He said that Mrs.

Tannenbaum had told him she had known Thomas Riha for many

years and had indicated to him that she helped Riha cone to

the United States and gave no further explanation. Fischer-

Galati advised that he had heard from unrecalled sources that

Tannenbaum claimed to be a Colonel in Military Intelligence.

He said after several conversations with her; however, he

became convinced she was not connected with any type intelli-

gence work and was not connected with Eastern European history.

He stated Tannenbaum was extremely careful in her conversations

with him and made no statements concerning affiliation with any

intelligence or governmental agency.

David Regosin, Attorney, 30 Broad Street, New York,

New York, advised on January 23,

1970 that he is attorney for

Rose Grossman and has also represented Hana Riha.

Mr. Regosin

stated his only contact with Galya Tannenbaum had been on or

about March 8, 1969 when he received a telephone call, allegedly

from Mrs. Tannenbaum, who said she was

calling from Colorado.

Mr. Regosin said this person indicated she was taking care of

the immigration problems of Hana Riha and she was not "going

out on a limb any more. " Tannenbaum during this conversation

appeared to be screaming and hysterical. Mr. Regosin stated

she did not directly represent to Mr. Regosin that she was an

officer or employee of the United States Government.

Mr. Bill Wade, Chief Underwriter,

Federal Housing

Administration (FHA), Denver, Colorado, advised on February 2,

1970 that Galya Tannenbaum came to his

office in the sumner of

1968 in an effort to obtain a one million dollar ($1,000,000)

development loan for the Lake Valley Estates of Boulder.

After

reviewing the material furnished by Mrs. Tannenbaum, Mr. Wade

stated the financial structure of the Lake Valley Estates was

not sufficient to grant such a loan.

Mr. Wade stated that

Tannenbaum made a trip to Washington, D. C., in January, 1969,

and registered a formal complaint against the Denver FHA

Office.

She also wrote a letter of

complaint to FHA in

Washington making complaints against FHA personnel in Denver.

Mr. Wade advised that at no time did Tannenbaum ever represent

herself to him as an employee of the United States Government,

either

in a civil or military capacity.

derives from a ballet dancer whom she admired by the name of

GALYA ZAKHAROVNA and a former conmon-law husband, LEO TANENBAUM.

She noted she still occasionally utilizes the name GALYA

ZAKHAROViA, and explained that she spells the name "TANNENBAUM"

slightly different fron that of LEO TANENBAUM to avoid any

implication that she was ever legally married to him.

where she had been seeking art work at the press office,

and in conversation with him at that time determined that

they were

that she resided at 5135 Kindark

the 5000 block of Kunbark Street.

Thereafter, she stated RItA would visit her residence on

they made tentative

Universim re chicago atavove this time,

and in August, 1967, he moved to 1155 - oth Street, Boulder,

Colorado, where he had obtained a teaching position with the

University of Colorado.

She followed him to Boulder in

October, 1967, and commenced residing with him in a common-

law relationship at this address until December, 1967, when

they broke up over the fact that he was not able to get along

with her two children who were residing with then,

TANNENDAUM continued that she returned to Chicago

at this time, where she remained until

came back to

colorado testablish residence in Denven there

she hoped to continue her profession as a graphic antist.

She stated she did not resume the common-law relationship

with RillA upon her return; hovever, she stated she was still

emotionally involved with

RInA and was considerably upset

when he narried liANA RIA, a much younger woman and a person

he had known only i short period of time prior to his marriage

to her.

TANNENBAUM categorically denied she ever represented

herself as

being connected in

any way with the Armed Forces of

the United States of that she had ever tried to give anyone

the impression that she

She also stated

she had never attempted to give the impression that she had

ever

been connected in any way with the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

She stated that RIllA has many times in the past

jokingly referred to her as "Sarge" and "Colonel" when he

thought she was being too demanding of him, and as

3. result

of this tendency on his part other people began calling her by

these names, with the whole matter actually being interpreted

by her as a

TANNENSAUM continued that there is a magazine

entitled "M-Intelligence" to which she subscribes and sub

mits articles.

She described this publication as being that

of an organization called "lensa," which she explained is

for people of superior intelligence.

She qualified member-

, in the organization by stating

she had an 1.Q. of 153

on a Stanford-Binet scale.

L'ANTENBAUM advised she may have

been misunderstood by li. GERALD CAPLAN, Boulder, Colorado,

the attorney for HANA RiA, regarding certain statements

allegedly made by her that she was affiliated with Military

Intelligence.

She recalled a conversation in the office of

Mr. CAPLN concerning the immigration

status of lIANA RIIIA

during which she told

CAPLAN she was with "M-I," a term

utilized to impress him with her intelligence rather than

to assert affiliation with Military Intelligence.

TANNENBAUH also stated that in July, 1969, she made

a trip by private plane to son Antonio, Texas,

ZDENCK

CERVENt, nephew od InOhAS RIliA, to visit relatives or RInA

and CERVENY.

She stated she made the trip at CERVENY'S

insistence, principally bocuuse she would not allow him to

utilize her autonobile for the trip as well as the fact that

since she felt she would cventually probably have to pay for

this trip anyway: she might just as well go along for the ride.

TANNENBAUM advIsed that when she called the Judson Flying

Service in Longnont, Colorado, to arrange for this trip,

had not made any statement that she was

in any way connected

with any branch of the Unitcd States Government.

She denied

making any statements whatsoever to the pilot of the airplane

concerning her atlallation with the covernment, and statec

that when she arrived back in Denver she paid the pilot with

a $330 check drawn on the first Mational Bank, Boulder, Colorado,

which had been previously signed by THOMAS RIMA for her con-

venience.

She denied

that she made any representations

presenting this check io the pilot of the airplane

and insisted

that as far as she knew RIHA had sufficient funds in the bank

with which to cover the cost of the flignt.

At this point, PAINENBAUM

stated she was tired of

being made a fool of by the false allegations that she had been

impersonating military and Government personnel, and did not

desire to discuss the matter further.

irs. Cedesday,

12, !g, 1 met with

Gilya cannonbaud in my office at my request.

This visic was i!

connection

with the deportation and divorce matter in shich i was

representing irs. Mana

Riha.

It had been my understanding prior to this visit that Mrs. Riha was being

assisted by tirs. Tannenbaum with regard to her immigration status and other

matters.

Based upon my conversations with Mrs.. Riha and her aunt and uncle, "r

and Mrs. Grossman, prior to my visit with Mrs. Tannenbaum, Mrs. Tannenbaum was

apparently exerting a substantial amount of pressure on Mrs. Riha and had

indicated to them that she had some official position in the Government.

Tannenbaum, at the meeting in my office, told me that she was with

MI 4, which I asked her to explain.

She indicated that MI 4 was the Military

Intelligence

Division of the Army in this District.

she, further stated that

she had been

associated with Military Intelligence for 25 years and that becauss

of her connections in Military Intelligence she had many friends in the Justice

Department and in the Immigration service, whom she had been contacting in ar

effort to assist Mrs. Riha.

She further stated that she had

obtained Mirs. Rita's

immigration file and that at that time she had possession of the file. She

appeared to be knowledgeable concerning

the various immigration laws.

She stated

that there were certain documents which Hana must file. She also mentioned that

because her position in Military Intelligence enabled her to arrange for the

Postoffice Department to place an earlier postmark date on some correspondence

which Hana had filed after the time for filing the documents had expired.

I stated to her that I thought it was appropriate, in order to protect my

client, to ask her to produce certain credentials or identification.

She stated

she did noi have any identification with her, that she did have a plastic card

which identified her with Military Intelligence, and that she would see that i
