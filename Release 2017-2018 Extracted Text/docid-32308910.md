-POSSIBLE TRAVEL OF KANSAS CITY HOODLUM FIGURES TO

HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA, ON OR ABOUT 3/1/69; AR."

For the information of New York, a group of

individuals from Kansas City has annually, about this

time of the year, traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana,

and Ocean Springs, Mississippi, for approximately one week

for the purpose of a vacation and to play golf.

Because of

FBI investigations and surveillances in the Mississippi

and Louisiana areas, this group apparently changed their

destination this year to Hollywood, Florida.

According to KC 358-C-TE, the purpose of the trip

this year, as in the past, was for

the purpose of playing

golf, to gamble and meet with friends. These individuals

had reservations at the Hollywood Beach Hotel, Hollywood,

Florida.

Four of the individuals who made this trip have

previously been identified as LCN members and are as follows:

CARL JAMES CIVELLA, (brother of NICHOLAS

CAVELLA,

boss) ;
