San Juan

Re Miami letter, 7/31/73, and San Juan letter,

9/25/73, to Bureau.

MM 1337-S and

MM 7550-KS hadv advised that

membership in the PRP among Cuban exiles in Miami has de-

teriorated to the point where the PRP possesses little,

if any significance.

Since the current leader, MANUELARAY, lives

In Puerto Rico where the PRP appears to be headquartered,

it is recommended that San Juan be origin in this case.

No pertinent information concerning the PRP

has been developed in Miami since relet of 7/31/73.

REQUEST OF BUREAU

Bureau is requested to designate San Juan 00

in this matter.
