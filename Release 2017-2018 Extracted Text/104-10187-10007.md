The security wall recenly ereered in the height of 4.5 meters

around the perimerer of the LIMERICK installation has reduced somowhat che

area of coverage of the LICALLA base. Cortaln interior arrangements have

been made, such as raising the floor of the operating room at LICALLA, whie

sill allow continued operation of the base, However, if some suri uf vegeratio

grows over the wire sirands at the cop of the fence, the view of the base will

be shut off comploicly and other arrangemenis for phoio coverage of the

LICALLA arca of responsibility will have to be made.
