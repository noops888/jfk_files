3. Iraining. None.

4. Photographic Operations.

a. At the request of Gerald F. GESTETNER, ASKREN was involved

as one of the participants in the planning stage of a surreptitious entry into

the apartment of a priority Station target. ASKREN was to assist Walter C.

GULLIVAN, once access had been gained to the target installation. However,

through no fault of the KURIOT technicians, the entry could not be accomplished

and the operation was then cancelled.

b. On the morning of 3 May, ASKREN was requested by GESTETNER

to photograph a meeting that was scheduled between a Soviet intelligence

officer and LIOYSTER/1. ASKREN registered under an alias name at a hotel

in downtown Mexico City. From a second story bedroom window, overlooking

a park, the meeting was successfully photographed with the aid of a Balscope

and Exacta camera.

c. The FJSTEAl and PBRUMEN Embassies were both photographed

on 4 May at the request of the Chief of Station. Prints were then forwarded

to the Warren Commission, This coverage supplied the Station with current

photographs of both Embassies, which is always of considerable value.

d. FRANCOTTE placed the Pulse Camera at the LIERODE basehouse

during the evening of 26 May.

The new camera, received from KURIOT

Headquarters,

was installed and is operating perfectly. The older model

camera has been pouched to Headquarters for reconditioning, as requested

in HMMW -12500.

The current lease on the LITABBY basehouse will expire on

26 June and is not going to be renewed by the Station. LIMOPE and his family

have been moved to the STPESO basehouse where they will be involved in a

continuous audio oeration. For the immediate future, there is no photographic

coverage planned for the BEDOX Embassy. However, FRANCOTTE has

discussed with Phineas F. SLINKARD the possibility of opening a new basehouse

in that same immediate area. There is an apartment building nearby, which

is in a "direct line of sight" with the front gate of the target Embassy, and

the possibilities of obtaining an apartment in that building are being explored.

KURIOT Headquarters will be kept informed on all developments in this case

as they occur.

5. Station Support.

a. The Deputy Chief of Station presented FRANCOTTE with a colored

map which he requested copied for projection. Ektachrome-X was employed,

combined with the Mark-IV copying set-up, and the results were most

satisfactorÿ.: The new Ektachrome-X proves far superior to the regular type

Ektachrome for copying purposes.

b.

One hundred twenty five fee t of Microfilm was exposed on 7 May

to fulfill a monthly request originated by the Chief of Station.

c. The Station KURIOT equipment has been completely inventoried

que to the concentrated effort of Gerald N. ASKREN, during his recent IDY.

ASKREN ha dilarge percentage of the equipment inventoried when FRANCOTTE

returned to work, and remaining items were completed by FRANCOTTE and

ASKREN prior the latter's departure. FRANCOTTE sincerely appreciates the

assistance rendered by ASKREN on this project, as ASKREN's familiarity in

logistical matters was quite beneficial to FRANCOTTE.

d. On 20 May, FRANCOTTE purchased eight hundred Mexican postage

stamps in support of a standing monthly requirement of the KURIOT/PI

section.

These stamps, for the June mailing, were forwarded via HMMA-23496, 26 May

1964.

e. The new KURIOT laboratory is now fairly well organized and

operating smoothly. The custom-made cabinets will be a welcome addition when

they are delivered sometime during the month of June.

The laboratory area,

although small in size, is very adequate for a "One man lab" and FRANCOTTE

finds it a most convenient area in which to work.

f. A total of 59 job orders were completed during the month of May,

with a Station print production grand total of 894.

6. Secret Writing Activity•

During this reporting period, one SW message from DEGRIP was

developed for Lawrence E. BARKER.

„System 37, spray can, was used anc

the message developed very well. The RKNICK letters that were opene

during the month of May were examined for the possiblepresence of SW, all

with negative results.

Non-dstructive methods were employed in each case.

7. Flaps and Seals Operations.

a, Lee R. MYLECHRAINE informed FRANCOTTE that he would

require his assistance for a flaps and seals operation planned for the night of

19 May. That evening, twelve letters were passed to MYLECHRAINE from

SWLUCK/1 who was acting as a FJSTEAL courier between Mexico City and

Guatemala. Ten of the twelve letters were selected as being of importance,

and one of the ten was of definite interest to the Station, This particular

envelope had been folded by the originator and sealed with scotch tape.

FRANCOTTE

was successful in opening and resealing all ten of the letters

in the time allowed. MYLECHRAINE did not receive the package until 2330

hours and the letters were required to be returned to SWLUCK/1 no later than 0100.

b. During the month of May, three ZRKNICK letters were opened and

resealed for Glenna H. PELLEN.

8.

Operational Disguise Activities.

During this reporting period, Lola M. CAPOZZI provided disguise

support once again to Gerald L. GARDYNE, Chief of Base, Monterrey.

Two

sessions were held, with a total of six hours spent in preparing GARDYNE

for his meeting with LIOXIDE/l. There were no supplies issued, and no

training was given for self-application of materials.
