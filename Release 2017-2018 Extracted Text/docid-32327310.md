Chicago notes with interest, information furnished by

ALLEY on December 30, 1969, which is set out in the first

and second paragraphs on page two of this letter relating

to the Egyptian individual who ALLEY also met in Copenhagen,

Denmark, as follows:

ALLEY advised that while in Santa Fe, New Mexico,

he had had to have a clearance for some work he was doing.

Shortly after receiving the clearance, either in 1964 or

1965, he received a letter from an Egyptian whom he had

also

met in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The letter was addressed

to his parents in Pennsylvania and forwarded to him in

Santa Fe, New Mexico.

ALLEY explained, while he was in

Europe, he used his

parents' Pennsylvania address.

ALLEY

continued, the Egyptian, whose name he could not recall,. he

believed advised in the letter that he was teaching

renew old

knew them separately and did not know they knew each other.!

ALLEY answered

ALLEY also advised, in his letter, that the Egyptian was

welcome to visit him anytime he came to Santa Fe, New

Mexico.

ALLEY never received a reply nor has he

ever

been visited by this Egyptian. ALLEY stated that he has

long since thrown the letter away.

ALLEY continued he was fairly sure this

Egyptian was a chemical engineer, who had graduated from

the University of Texas and had

come back to Egypt and

married an Egyptian and worked, for a time, with a paint

company in Egypt.

ALLEY was carrying a

One of the unidentified individuals

other individull was later identified as AUMED EL BADAWI.. :

MOHAMED ABDEL-SALOM, an Egyptian National who was born

When interviewed

on June 6.61961, ALLEY recalled

visiting a restaurant with the Soviet and MARVIN KANTOR

(another visiting United Settes citizen, subject lot Bureau

File 105-77772) and

"two or

names he could not recall.

It is noted that throughout

both interviews with ALLEY, he apologized for an inability

to recall names and places, due to the considerable amount

of traveling and

the large number of individuals

whom, he

had met during the period of his European tour

Chicago recognizes that the Egyptian mentioned

by ALLEY in referenced Albuquerque letter and the Egyptian

identified at the Copenhagen restaurant meeting may not be

one and the same individual and for this reason his statement

may be completely truthful or that they may be identical

and

he has, through the passage of time, forgotten this

neeting. In either event

between these two matters does not feel that the possibility

can be overlooked even though on the surface there are

disparities in the reported backgrounds of these Egyptians.
