Enclosed to the Bureau are 11 copies, to Miami

two copies and to New York and San Juan one copy each of

an LHM dated and captioned as above.

It is noted that

during interview,

declined to give the location of captioned organization's

base of operations outside the United States and flatly

stated that the organization was receiving no help and

wanted no help from the United States Government. He also

indicated that his superiors in the organization were cogni-

zant of his contact with the FBI. &U

The enclosed LHM is classified "Confidential"

because

requested that his identity not be made

known outside the United States Government circles and

also because Miami letter and LHM dated 3/29/66 indicated

that the United States Army Field Appraisal Detachment,

Miami, Florida, had an operational interest in TONY CUESIA

and about 15 other members of Comandos LJ Ït is felt that

unauthorized disclosure of the info in the LHM could be

harmful to United States Defense interests. @V"
