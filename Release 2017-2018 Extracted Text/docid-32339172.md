matter except in the presence of his attorney, who he

advised is LEONARD BOUDIN.

BOUDIN is a law partner

Of VICTOR RABINOWITZ, who has been active in the

FPCC.

Information has been received that RABINOWITZ

was recently voted off the Executive Committee of the

FPCC and allegations that he was a Communist were made

against him. On 12/2/60, the Bureau advised that in

terview of GIBSON's refusal to discuss anything except

in the presence of his attorney and in view of BOUDIN's

background, it is not felt that any purpose would be

served in pursuing the interview of GIBSON under the

terms laid down by him.

In view of the subject's position with the

FPCC, an active pro-CASTRO organization, the

subject

is being recommended for inclusion on the security

Index.
