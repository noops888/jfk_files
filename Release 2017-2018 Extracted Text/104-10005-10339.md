WARREN COMMISSION REPORT - Pelicy recommendations

as stated in Prepaganda Notes issue of 22 Sept

The long awaited Warren Commission Report, on its exhausive

investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy on November

22, 1963 and the subsequent wurder of Lee Oswald by Jack Ruby, will be

sent to the White House on Thursday September 24th and will probably be

released sometime over the weekend. The Department of State is air pouch-

ing copies of the Report (based on some 20 volumes of hearings) to posts

for selective presentation (upon formal release) to "editors, jurists,.

Government officials, other opinion-leaders" after the formal release.

(See attachment, State Circular 505, 19 September 1964, Joint State-USIA

message, with list of recipients).

Copies of this Government Printing

Office edition will be sent to field stations from headquarters.

2. Reports from around the world indicate that there is a strong

in many countries that the assassination of the President was the

result of a "political plot"; the unwarranted interpretation that Ruby's

murder of Oswald was committed to prevent Oswald from revealing the pur-

ported conspiracy adds to this belief. Commmist regimes have used both

murders to denigrate American society and the release of the Report will

undoubtedly be used as a new peg for the same purpose.

3. Covert assets should explain the tragedy wherever it is genuinely

misunderstood and counter all efforts to misconstrue it intentionally

provided the depth of impact warrants such action. Communists and other

extremists always attempt to prove a political conspiracy behind violence.

In countries accustomed to assassination by political conspiracy, American

dedication to institutions of law and government with stable adrinistrative

procedures can be described; and American Presidents can be shown to have

been the victims (with the exception of Lincoln) of single, fanatical indi-

viduals.

4. Three commercial editions will be published as soon as possible

after the formal release. KUWOLF/PROP has ordered 150 of Bantam's publi-

cation but will evaluate

the introductions of all three and Inform operat

ing Divisions of any drawbacks. Divisionsshould make bulk purchases for

field use through regular channels.
