MiSs MIRTA BORRAS ALMANZA, PSI-Under Development,

who has furnished reliable information in the past, on

6/22/65, stated that the JURE would hold a convention in

Tampa, Florida, over the weekend of 7/3/65.

She said she

did not intend

delegates from various cities where the JURE has represen-

tatives.

MiSs BORRAS advised that she did not see anything of

value which might come out of this convention as the JURE was

Miss BORRAS stated that she would inform the NYO

of any information she received concerning this convention.

The above is being submitted to the Bureau and
