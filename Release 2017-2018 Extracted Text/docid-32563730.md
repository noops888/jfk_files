The original of the above statement is being retained

in the file of the New Orleans Field Division.

Subject advised that his true name is JOHN CAESAR GROSSI

and he has used the names JACK GROSSI and JACK DALE WILLIAMS. He stated he

was born August 5, 1927 at Paterson, New Jersey and this fact was verified

by teletype from the Newark Field Division dated July 5, 1941.

GROSSI advised that his mother is Mrs. ROSE GROSSI, re-

siding at 268 17th Avenue, Paterson, New Jersey; his father is JOHN GROSSI,

now in the Army and divorced from his mother. He hás run away from home

several times in the past and was, therefore, placed in a foster home with

Mr. and Mrs. JOE LEONARD, 115 Dixon Avenue, Paterson, New Jersey where he

lived from November. 1942 to March 1943. He ran away from his foster home

and was placed in the State Home for Boys in New Jersey in March 1943.

He

• was there a short time when he was placed on parole in order to work at

Adrian's Diner in Cranbury, New Jersey.

He ran away from this employment in

March 1944, shortly before his parole was to be terminated. He thereafter

traveled throughout the southeastern part of the country on a bus, going

through Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,D.C., Raleigh, N. C., Charleston,

S.C., and Savannah,

Georgia. In Savannah he stated he was arrested by the

FBI for wearing the Maritime Service uniform. He said he was wearing the

blue uniform with Maritime Service insignia on the sleeve and a white sailor's

hat with a neckerchief.

This uniform had previously belonged to his brother,

AIBERT GEORGE CROSSI, who was formerly in the Merchant Marine, and who is now

in the U.S.

Army.

He was not prosecuted in Savannah due to his age but stated

that he was instructed to return to his home in Paterson, N.J. Instead of

returning home, he traveled by bus to Jacksonville, Florida, where he pur-

chased a U. S. Maritime Service insignia which he wore on his right sleeve

and also the Chief Petty Officer's insignia which he placed on his left sleeve.

He wore this uniform most of

the time during his travels.

Subject was found to be in possession of an identification

card in the name of JACK DALE WILLIAMS, 268 17th Avenue, Paterson, New Jersey,

employed by U. S. Maritime Service, Social Security No. 577-24-7851.

two typewritten statements which he admitted preparing on a typewriter and

to which he affixed signatures of persons unknown to him..
