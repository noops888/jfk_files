Berep Special Agent John I. Fagan dated 1/3/64

at lew fork.

It is noted that the FD-305 subnitted with cerep

indicates the report is being classified "Confidential"

but that certain information furnished by IF 1491-3*

should be classifled "Secret." Since the report contains

information attributed to IT 1191-S* under the symbol T-6,

the report should have been classified "Secrot" rather than

"Confidential" as all reports on Security Indes subjects

are disseminated to the Department of Justice.

Additionally, on page 5 of rerep, the information

received from T-6 is set forth. It is belleved that this

information requires additional clarification, 1f available.

The source of the contributions received by Forer should be

set forth if known since it is ambiguous as to whether this

money represents "contributions" or

actually money

received in payment of logal fees.

X. И

Abt recently received nationwide publicity when

Loe Harvey Oswald publicly stated following his arrest that

he wanted Abt as his attorney. The report makes no mention

of this fact, and it is believed it should be set forth in

the report.

Dissemination of the report is being held in

abeyance
