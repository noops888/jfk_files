1. I have received numerous and highly complimentary com-

ments

from the Direcior, the Executive Director and the Acting

Deputy Director in Sapport for the sole this Offter played during the

visit of President dizon to the Agency on 7 March 176%.

In addition,

Mr. Don Gautreau, the Secret Service Agent responsible for protec-

tive measures duris, the visit, told me that he had never met a more

highly professional group of personnel than our Security officers.

He was impressed wits the comprehensive coverage inherent in our

protective measures.

2.

Our performance on Friday was smooth, efficient and

effective and once more is a tribute to our ability to rise to any

occasion.

Thie is possible only because of the quality of the effort

put forth by each Security Officer who participated. lam very proud

of all of you and I scold like to particularly corimend Jim McCord,

and

—for the work they did in planning our

role in the ceremonies. Equally impressive was the performance of

Jand bis people in the provision of audio coverage of

the event.

3.

THROUGH

:.Head of 89 Career Service

SUBJECT

: Notification of Non-cligibility for Designation as a

Participant

in the CIA Retirement and Disability

System

1.

As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment

history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify

those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CLA.

Retirement and Disability Syster.

each case

is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head os his

Career Service nominates rim for participation in the syster, this nomina-

tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action

to me.

However; if the Head of the Carcer Service advises thät the employee

does not mect

the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have

accepted

this finding

without further review by the CIA Retirezent. Board.

This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening

process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-

ten may be designated participants as soon as possible.

In your case, the Head

of your Career Service has advised mo that

requirements of HR 20-50 for designation

• pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by

regulation that you are not eligible for designation.

From. a review of your

record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior co completing 15 years

of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months

of qualifying service as required by regulation.

My determination that you

are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current.

status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude recon-

sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should

meet the requirements for designation in the future..

Should you desire further information concerning

the requirements

for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

jou read paragraph e of

HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin

cated. 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination

nade_in your-case -nay have-been incomplete or inaccurate regarding

your actual

exployment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited

above, you have

questions regarding the determination that you are-not eligi-

ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System,

please feel free to contact

officiais

of your Career Service..

They are familiar with the details of your

case and will gladly discuss them with you.

In addition, you may sish to dis-

cuss jour case with the CIA Retirement

Staff located in Room 65-1319 Head-

Quarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve

any questions

vou have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally

considered by the Board..

However, this request must be made within 30 days of

the date of this memorandum.

Fitness Report

This is an annual fitness s port covering the period

1 April 1969 through 31 March 1970,

Mr. McCord completed

his firet full year as Chier, Phynical Socurity Division.

During

1969 the Division underwent many changes, a direct result of the

personal efforta of this employee. He has shown the initiative

to sock out new ways and neans to harden the security of our

domestic and overscas facilities by tapping all possible tech-

nological sources both in and out of Government. Hie efforts

have produced tangible results and in my judgment, our posture

in the physical security field is far superior to any of our con-

teniporaries.

With the

spiraling costs of manpower, Mr. McCord

has concentrated on the potential for use of technical devices to

replace the human asse:.

He has made reniarkable inroads into

this field by way of imagination, ingenuity and drive.

3. Mr. McCord has he quality to inspire his subordinates.

He is demanding, but understanding. On more than one occasior.

he was asked to take under his wing employees who were labeled

"problems." Through personal interest and effort, he has salvaged

the majority of these individuals to a point where they are performing

in a highly satisfactory manner.

4. In the previous fitness report, I alluded to the fact that

employee has a tendency to find it difficult to see another person's

point of view. This, I leel, is attributablè to an innate subbornness

which obviously is difficult to overcome. Mr.

McCord is a very

1: 11: 1070

## Page 94

principled individual who once convinced he has hit upon the proper

course of action will usually gield enly by direction, We're discussed

this, and l've noted a determined effort on his part to broaden his

tolerance for other opinions:

5. Overall, the employer has made a substantial contribution

to the Office of Securito by his dedication to hio job, his tenacious

attitude toward upgrading our physical security standards, a curious

and inventive mind ever searching dus better waya lo solve a problem

in hid area of responsibility, and a cost consciousness in the admini-

stration of his division. I rate hini an overall "Strong."

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT

McCORD, James W., Jr., Emp. Ser. No. 058124

Fitnesa Report

1. This in an annual fitnces report covering the period

1 April 1968 through 31 March 1969. During the firet period of

this report, Mr. McCord served as the Chief, Technical Division/

PTOS and continued to display a very high degree of professionaliam

in adminintering the Agency's world-wide

_program. Undes his guidance, several new devices and

techniques were developed which have helped the Agency.and the

Intelligence community to maintain pace with the sophisticated

advances by the opposition in the field

2. Mr. McCord initiated the necessary planning for the

activation of the Interagency Training Center (ITC) which provides

instruction to all members of the community in the latest of

equipment and techniques.

3. On 14 October 1968, he was reassigned to the position

of Chief, Physical Security Division. Although he had relatively

little experience in this particular field, he has quickly assimilated

the necessary details to manage this Agency effort. He has taken

steps toward the development. and use of the most advanced

to protect the Agency. Under

the supervision of Mr. McCord, the Agency Security Command

Conter operations have been expanded and improved. He has been

assigned the rexponsibility to organize and direct the Security efforts

relating to the protection of Agency assets in time of demonstrations,

riots, and other civil disturbances.

He coordinated the Agency

Security effort with the U. S. Secret Service in protection of the

President of the United States during his recent visit to the ClA

Headquarters.

---

## Page 97

Mr. MiCord is considered to be economical in his use

of equipment, manpower and funds.

5.

Perhaps one of the stronger attributes thie employee

posseeses is his ability lo organize. In a relatively short time.

he has deliberated the Physical Security Division's miasion and

already taken stepa to restructure it within existing manpower

limitatione lo more electively react to its sesponsibilities.

6. Ho inspires his subordinates and has the respect of his

superiors.

There have been instances, however, when Mr. McCord

has exhibited a certain intolerance with individuals who du rot auset

with his point of view, resulting in some friction in their working

relations.

There has been much improvement in this regard, and

I do not feel it will present any problem in the future.

7: I anticipate this employee will continue to absorb krri

ledge and experience in the physical security field at the rapid rate

he has during his short tenure and am confident his efforts will

result in a major contribution to the Office and Agency, I rate

Mr. McCord a high "Strong. "

Jovaluation of Mr. McCord's

vigor and enthusiasm, skill and judgment. I would add to this that he

has demonstrated extraordinary ingenuity and leadership in supervising

the derciopment of several new and valuable techniques in the counter-

measures field. However, I vould rate him only "Proficient" in

Specific Duty Number 6, for I beliere that he has not been as éffective

as he might be in liaison and coordination with other components of

the Intelligence Community represented on the Technical Committee.

This is unfortunate, for it detracts from his outstanding performance

in all other clements of his assigned responsibilities.

He must work

on irriproving these

relationships and he has been counseled to this

effect by his current supervisor.

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD

Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories

contained in the Grid; understaud their personal managerial styles in Grid

terma; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action

skills; increage casdidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for

problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Cul-

ture and Development.

The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of

level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught"' in the usual sense.

In

Grid teyme, participants solve complex management problems. Objective soll-

tions ari made available. Individual

and team performance is repcatedly

assessed. Various measuring instrumenta are used to evaluate eflectivenegs.

Critique sessiona isaiat each participant to understand how he might change

his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectivenees.

Thus managers

are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing themscives.

About twenty to thirty hourg ai siudy are completed as prework. Insights

Beined aro deepened and peraunnlized during the intensire 50-hour Seminar.
