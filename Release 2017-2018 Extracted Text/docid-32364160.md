whether there was "anything new concerning the telegran to Washington."

The guard checked and then told OSWAID that a request had been sent, but

nothing had as yet been received. (MaXI 6453, 9 October 1953) The FBI liaison

such non-clandestine meetings within a legal residency should be

restricted to a minimum both as to place and time. Meetings of

this type should be carried out only in exceptional cases with

tested and rellable agents in order ta avoid provocation by the

It is necessary that such meetings be conducted naturally, that

they do not attract the attention of outsiders, and that the receipt

and transmittal of Intelligence matters, properly camouflaged, be.
