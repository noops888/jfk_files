I. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

(21)

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select

Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for

Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the

investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as

follows:

(12)

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question. The role

of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense

of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

That was certainly the one that I would

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-

Castro assassination plots on the part of the CIA, would

you have given more priority, more emphasis, to the

possibility of a Castro conspiracy to kill the President?

Mr. Rocca.

Again, I say that it would have

simply intensified it, that there was attention given

to it, not particularly by the staff. I had no capabilities

on the Cuban side.

The Harker interview should have been undoubtedly

given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it

was given specific attention, I was told at the time of

the Rockefeller thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. In what way was the Cuban connection

investigated?

Mr. Rocca. I don't know.

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, when I said to what extent

the Warren Commission. I mean to what extent did the

Mr. Rocca. That I can't answer. I certainly

didn't, do it.

This was something left to the people who were concerned

Mr. Goldsmith. But I believe earlier we

established that Mr. Helms gave orders that information

pertinent to the assassination was to go through your

office, correct?

Mr. Rocca. .

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. And once information pertinent

to the assassination went through your office, I take (it)

you or Mr. Helms would decide what information would

be relevant for the Warren Commission to see.

Is that correct?

Mr. Rocca. Well =-

Mr. Goldsmith. Based upon what you knew?

Mr. Rocca. Well, everything would go, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Therefore, you were in the

position, it would seem, to know what information was

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

(46)

The Committee has contacted both representatives of

the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of

the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-

generated information to the Warren Commission. The

general consensus of these representatives is that the

41

Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful

working relationship during the course of the Commission's

investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent.

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was

propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the

CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination And the

tablishment of ch

soling visa nis the warren Commission.

He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible tob

Warren Commission requests

Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10

• Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

(55)

(56)

An inguiry would come over (from the Warren Com-

mission).

We would attempt to respond to it.

pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we

could. ((Ibid., pp. 10-7

oath he supported this proposition:

MI.

Goldsmith:

In summary, is it your position that

the Agency gave the Warren Commission

information only in response to speci-

fic requests by the Warren Commission?

Mr. Helms:

That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that

memory is fallable.

There may have been

times or circumstances under which some

thing different might have occured, but

my recollection is that we were attempting

to be-responsive and supportive to the

FBI and the Warren Commission.

they asked for something we gave it to

them.

is concerned, I have no recollection of

whether we volunteered it or not

(Ibid., p. 34

157)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

Commission requests on a casebasis rather than uniformly

volunteering relevant information to the Warren Commission

stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's perception

of the CIA's investigative responsibility. MI. Rankin was

asked by Committee Counsel whether he worked under the

impression that the Agency's responsibility was simply to

respond to questions that were addressed to CIA by the

Warren Commission. In response, Mr. Rankin testified as

follows:

Mr. Helms further indicated that the CIA might

be called upon to provide additional information

acquired from checks of CIA records and agency

sources. He suggested that certain policies be

employed to enable CIA to work cooperatively

with the Commission in a manner which would

protect CIA information, sources and methods.

Among the policies articulated were two which

Helms claimed would enable the Agency to control

the flow of Agency originated information.

In

this way the CIA could check the possibility of

revealing its sources and methods inadvertantly.

Telephone Taps

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to inform the Warren Commission, at least

during. the initial stage of the Commission's work,

of the CIA's telephonic and photo surveillance

operations in Mexico City.

The reason for the sensitivity of these

only becuase it was sensitive from the

Agency's standpoint, but the telephone

taps were cunning conjunction with

the Mexican authorities and therefore,

if this had become public knowledge,

it would have caused very bad feelings

and that was the reason. (Exec. Sess.

Vest. of Richard Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 51-52.

The CIA's unwillingness to inform the Warren

comnission in the early stages of its investigation

of the above-described surveillánce operations is

a source of concern to this Committee. Itis

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments

could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible

foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,

Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

the Agency's Cuban and Soviet telephone

intercepts that might suggest foreknowledge

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi

dent. This involves a faulty translation of an

answer Calderon gave to her caller.

In answer

to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."

The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere

(the first person of the verb enterarsede,

past tense) should be translated as

".T.I

found

out (or I learned) /about it -- the assassination?

almost before Kennedy Ldid/." In other words,

Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting

of Kennedy almost at the time the event took

place...

(CIA Doc., Memorandum

Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.l).

double

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narIow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's

comments as a suggestion on her part of possible

foreknowledge of President Kennedy's assassination.

told me that hers was a peculiar case and

that he himself believed that she had been

recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head

of the DGI, did not agree.

(the case officer) had investigated Luisa

Calderon.

This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted

a letter to her by an American who signed

his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar. As you know,

the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in

Spanish so I am not sure of how the name

If so, please indicate when and

The CIA responded by memorandum:

"Although the (Mexieo City Station considered

the conversation of sufficient possible

interest to send a copy to headquarters,

the latter apparently did nothing with

it, for there appears to be no record in the

conclusion that the Warren Commission was never

which it could evaluate Luisa Calderon's

Two difficult issues remain which are raised

by the Committee's finding. First, why didn't

the Agency provide the Calderon conversation to the

Warren Connission; secondly, why didn't the Agency

reveal to the Warren Commission its full knowledge

of Calderon's intelligence background, her possible

knowledge of Oswald and her possible connection to

the CIA or some other American intelligence apparatus.

The first question can be explained in benign

terms. It is reasonably possible that by sheer

*The CIA memorandum states in part as follows:

When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-l's defection

and considered the possibility that he

might have some knowledge of

the Oswald

case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions

to WH (Western Hemisphere) for debriefing

AMMUG-1...WH desk records reflect that

AMMUG-I was debriefed on 4 May 64 regarding

this questionnaire.../B/ecause the debriefing

on the Oswald case

was handled as a sensitive

matter, it was dictated directly to a CI

(Counterintelligence) stenographer on

5 May 1964.

Note:

A-1 was debriefed on

several subjects on 4 May 64. The procedure

was to assign each subject discussed a

debriefing number and they were written

up in contact report form by the WH case

officer.

The instructions from CI staff

were to handle the Oswald case debriefing

very closely and not to keep any copies in

WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was

logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing

report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly

to a cI staff stenographer. There would

be no reason to include the number 40 on

the report of this special debriefing for

CI staff, since it was their only debriefing

report.

We are certain it is the debriefing

report (#40) because the date is the same;

it is the only debriefing report on Oswald

listed in AMMUG-l records; and it it (sic)

the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in

Oswald's 201 file.

The most striking example of the CIA's direct

offer of support to AMLASH reported by the

1967 IGR states

"it is likely that at the very

moment President Kennedy was shot a CIA officer

was meeting with a Cuban agent in Paris and giving

him an

assassination device for use against CASTRO."

(Ibid."

The 1967 IGR offered no firm evidence confirming

or refuting Castro's knowledge of the AMLASH operation

prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. The

1967 IGR did note that in 1965 when AMLASH was

assassination, despite Castro's threat

to retaliate for such plotting. No one

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this

Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit

1978, p. 1) Mr. Pollock specifically

contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation

was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond

FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an

assassination operation.

In pertinent part, Pollock

drew the following conclusions:

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald

considered

the AMLASH operation to be a political

action activity with the objective of organizing

a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the

Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat.

I heard

Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation

frequently, and never heard him characterize it as

"assassiantion operation." Mr. FitzGerald

stated within my hearing on several occasione

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves

loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH

operation as an

"assassigntion operation"; the

case officer did not; I, as Executive Officer, never

discussed any aspect of the AMIASH operation with

Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other

the special assistants could not

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day

of President Kennedy's death.

AMLASH rejected the

pen with disdain. (Ibid., par. 4, p. 27), (Ibid.,

was an

assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's

death.

The broader and more significant issue,

as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether

the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy

to have been reported to the Warren Commission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation this

determination is a most difficult matter to

resolve. Reasonable men may differ in their

characterization of the Agency's operational

objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence

it is the Comnittee's position that such informa-

tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,

might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-

tive

corcern for possible Cuban involvement or

complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin

commented before this Committee:

...when I read.."the Church Committee's

report-it was

an ideal situation for

them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story and fit it

in with the facts that had to be met

and then either blame the rest of it

Depo. of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

The Committee is in agreement with Mr. Rankin

that had the AMLASH operation been disclosed to

the Warren Commission, the Commission might have

been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture

that has surrounded the AMLASH operation during

the past decade. As history now records, the AMLASH

operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba and the United States.
