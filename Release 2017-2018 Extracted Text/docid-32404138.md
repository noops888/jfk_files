MEMORANDUM FOR: The Director of Central Intelligence

FROM:

Stanley M. Moskowitz

Director of Congressional Affairs

SUBJECT:

DCI Testimony, on JFK Assassination

Materials Disclosure Act

1. You and FBI Director Sessions are scheduled to testify

on 12 May before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee at a

hearing on S.J. Res. 282, the "Assassination Materials Disclosure

Act of 1992.*

Your appearance will follow a congressional panel

of witnesses consisting of Senators Boren and Specter (who was a

counsel to the Warren Commission) and Congressman Stokes. The

Committee will conclude its hearing with a panel of witnesses

consisting of Professor Ernest May, of Harvard's Kennedy School

of Government; History Professor Athan Theoharis, of Marquette

University: and James Lesar, President of the locally based

Assassination Archive and Research Center.

Your opening

statement with your suggested revisions has been provided to OMB

for Administration coordination.

2.

The Department of Justice will not be sending a witness

to testify before the Committee.

The Committee has requested

that the Department at least send a representative to assist

Director

Sessions, who does not intend to address major policy

and legal issues

raised by the joint resolution.

Senator Glenn

will

not ask you to comment on

the constitutional objections to

the joint resolution raised by the Department of Justice, but

other Members of the Committee, such as Senator Levin, may raise

these issues.

3.

You should be aware that there is a disagreement between

CIA and the FBI regarding what constitutes assassination

materials.

We have taken the position that all the sequestered

House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) materials

constitute assassination material.

FBI Director Sessions

has

taken

the position in his opening statement that assassination

material should include only "core" records directly related to

the assassination le.g., records on Oswald and Ruby) and that an

additional 265,000 pages of material requested by the HSCA

covering oranized crime and

other criminal investigations should

not be considered assassination material since it does not she√†

any light on who killed Kennedy. It is likely that you and

Director Sessions will be asked

about these differing positions,

so you may wish to discuss

this

with Director Sessions in

advance.
