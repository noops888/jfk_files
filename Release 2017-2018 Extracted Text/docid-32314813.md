AR

On 12/31/63, DE 878-C-TE advised that he is in frequent contact

with NICK DITTA (local arsonist, reported enforcer, and, accord-

1ng to DE 919-0s, a "soldier" in Cosa Nostra.) DITTA recently

spoke in "glowing terms" of PAUL STRACCI (PH) Or STROZZE (PH)

who has a drugstore in Buffalo.

DITTA described STRACCI as a

"man of the arts" and said that STRACCI makes many trips to

Italy.

It was the impression of DE 878-C-TE that DITTA was

making STRACCI out to be a "Hafia ambassador" between the U.S.

and

sicily.

Buffalo 1s

requested to furnish identity of PAUL STRACCI (PH)

or STROZZI (PH) 1f known, evaluate possible Cosa Nostra connec

tions, and
