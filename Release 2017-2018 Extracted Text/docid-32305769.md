FOR THE SUBJECT MUST BE EXTREMELY DISCREET. SU TESS ON S

JUNE 2, 1977, REPORTED THAT THE SUBJECT HAS RECENTLY INDICATED

AN

INTEREST INIPARTICIPATING IN CORU. THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT

THE SUBJECT IS ACTING UNDER CUIS DIRECTION AS HE HAS BEEN

RELATIVELY INACTIVE, IN THE ANTI-CASTRO MOVEMENT IN THE LAST

TWO YEARS. SU (1655-C HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED TO ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW

AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBJECT, CONSISTENT

WITH APPROPRIATE SECURITY, SAN JUAN FEELS THAT THE INVESTIGATION

IN THIS MATTER SHOULD, FOR THE PRESENT, BE EXTREMELY DISCREET,

SLOW, AND LOW-KEY

THE OCELOT CASE IS PROGRESSING WELL, IS OF

KNOWN QUANTITY,

HAS EXCELLENT POTENTIAL IN BOTH THE PRO AND

ANTI-CASTRO AREAS

NOTHING SHOULD BE DONE TO JEOPARDIZE THE

OCEL OT OPERATION

SHOULD THE SUBJECT BECOME AWARE OF THE BUREAU'S .

WILL NATURALLY ASSUME THAT HIS CONTACT WITH

CUIS HAS BEEN BLOWN AND AS A RESULI THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION

COULD BE TRACED BACK TO SU (1849-0A

THEREBY ENDING THE OA'S

IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE FBI HAS NOT CONDUCIED AN ACTIVE

ALSO IF THE SUBJECT IS COOPERATING WITH CUIS IT IS ASSUMED THAI

THE RELATIONSHIP WILL BE LONG GOING THUS ALLOWING HIM TO BECOME

MORE DEEPLY INVOLVED AND THEREBY INCREASING THE BUREAU•S POTENTIAL

TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS INVOLVEMEN. (S)

ALSO TO BE CONSIDERED

IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE INFORMA-

'OF THE DA'S RELIABILITY.

THE SUBJECT MAY ALREADY HAVE BEEN

THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE SU I349-OAJ THE LONGER THE SUBJECT CONTINUES

IT WOULD BE TO ASCERTAIN THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION SHOULD THE
