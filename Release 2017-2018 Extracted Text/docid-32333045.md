EK Law 11(a)

Information Relating to the S. J. Gully Bank at

Farrell, Pa.

During the course of investigation in the LA ROCCA matter,

it has been determined that the North Star Cement Block

Company of Pittsburgh,

pa.,

was obligated, as of 1959,

to the S. J. Gully Bank, to the extent of approximately

$29,000.

On November 3, 1961, JOHN MULLANEY, Special Assistant to

the Attorney General of the United

States, requested

information concerning the possibility of

a current or

recent affiliation by the aforementioned bank with any

Federal regulatory agency.

On November 3, 1961, CHARLES HOUTT, Assistant Cashier,

Federal

Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Pittsburgh Branch,

advised that he personally recalls the s. J. Gully Bank of

Farrell, Pa., as

a private bank prior to the time it

sold out approximately five or six years ago; that he

has never known of the s. J. Gully Bank being a national

bank, a member.of the Federal Reserve System, or to be

insured by the

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and

that according to the current directory of member banks in

the fourth Federal Reserve District, which includes Farrell,

Pa., the S. J. Gully Bank is not a member of the Federal

Reserve System.

On November 3, 1961, DREW DIEDRICK, Examiner, Federal

Deposit Insurance Corporation, 245 Rodilin Drive, Pittsburgh

35, Pa., advised SA FRANK E. ALLISON that he has

been

employed in the Western Pennsylvania area since 1949

as an examiner, and that during this period the s. J. Gully

Bank of Farrell, Pa., was never subject to examination by

the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and is not

now subject to such an examination.

He stated

that if

the bank was FDIC insured, it would be subject to examination

by FDIC examiners, and he would have knowledge of this fact:
