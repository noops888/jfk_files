7. Source added that they had also guest lecturers who were

officers from the Committee of State Security of Byelorussia who

came to the school on infrequent basis to conduct seminars. Once

in awhile guest lecturers from the Second [internal security and

counterintelligence] Chief Directorate ISCD] Center or the First

[foreign intelligence] Chief Directorate [FCD] in Moscow would

come to conduct a specific exercise.

c. One instructor discussed his involvement with Lee

HarveyDOSWALDyand how he ran OSWALD. [Debriefer's Comment:

Source was not sure if it was a true story or just some talk.]

This instructor alleged that Marina was a plant and that OSWALD

was an agent. Source opined that it was a piece of cake for the

KGB to run the OSWALD operation in the Soviet Union.

source is

also convinced that Marina had to be a plant of the KGB. The

operation was organized by the KGB and OSWALD fell in love with

her.

The instructors also indicated in their lectures that the

KGB

did not task OSWALD to kill the President. [NOTE: Believe

we should return to this topic again and discuss it with Source

in more detail.]

Source questioned KGB'S rationale in running

OSWALD, an ex-marine with very little access to information.

Based on information available to source at the school the KGB

did in fact run OSWALD.
