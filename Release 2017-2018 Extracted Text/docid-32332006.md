On March 16, 1959, MI. JOHN KERNAN, Manager, Sea:

Gull Hotel, Miami Beach, florida,

advised that he is

personally acquainted with SAMMY,MANNARINO Of New Kensington,

Pennsylvania: that. MANNARINO has in the past been a frequent

guest of the Sea full and that MANNARINO usually registers

under a fictitious name. He recalled that in the fall or

early winter of 1958, MANNARINO was a guest at the Sea

o his

Gull while using the name of MANN. MI. KERNAN said he himself

did not register MANNARINO, nor checked him out.

SAMÜELT MANNARIND

MI. KERNAN

produced his registration card file;

address given. MANN registered in room 409, at 1:36 A.M., on a

October 24, 1950g

and departed on November 7, 1958, The

card reflected that MANN came to the hotel off the street,

apparently without previous reservation.

The registration

card bore a time stamp reflecting the actual time of

arrival at the hotel was 1:36 A.M., on October 25, 1958,

and the actual time of departure was 9:07 P.M., November 7, 1958.

ME. KERNAN, upon examining this card, stated that

although he felt reasonably certain that this was the

registration card of MANNARIN, he could not testify to this

effect as he was not present at the time this party checked

in and checked out.

The card bore the initials of JAMES I. YERBY,

Night Auditor, as the clerk who checked MANN in.

MT. KERNAN, after examining the registration card,

said that the party was checked out by WERNER MITCHELL, who

is no longer employed at the Sea Gull Hotel.

He said that

MITCHELL was married to a daughter of BEN CHASIN, President

of the Sea Gull Hotel, has since separated from this woman,

and now reportedly lives in

Chicago
