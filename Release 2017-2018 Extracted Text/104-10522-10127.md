It is belleved that the lack of the traditional exchange of Christmas

greetings between the Mexican Goverment and the Cuban Embassy was

the result of the resentrent caused among Mexican officialdom by che

strong note dated

26 covember 1963, recelved by thie Mexican Minislry

of Foreign Relations froa Raul Roa

Garcia, Cuban Minister of Foreign

Relations, over the detention by Mexican authorities of Silvia Ilrado

de Duran, Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, in

connection with che visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City of Leg

Harvey Oswald, allesed assassin of John F. Kennedy, former Preaiden!

of the United States.

2. It 18 belleved that the Cuban Government'a refusal to give Del Rio a

Visa la also related to Ros'e note and the Cuban Government'e desire co

avold antagonizing the Mexican Covernment further.
