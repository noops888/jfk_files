Secretary of State Villiam P. Rogers called. Ho stated ho was

calling, after a discussion with the Fresident, about the Bureau's liaison

offices abroad, and, of course, he thought it was a good idea and they (the

State Department) are enthusiastic about it, but he had just one question

which he thought could be handled on the phone due to his busy schedule.

He said the only one he had any reservation about 1s Helsinki, Finland,

tho roason being, it word gets out, it could appear that it is in conneccion

with the sall talks or that we are

trying to be provocative. He continued

that if I thought it vill be productive, he thought they vere perfoctly

propared to take the slight risk that is involved in open discussion about

but if I thought it is not apt to be productive, he vould prefer not to.

I told him I am perfectly willing to postione it and not have 1t

included in line vith the recommendations we have made until after the

SALT thing is over and i1 at that timo it is felt desirable to have it there,

it can bo talon up again.

Ir. Rogers suggosted then why not go abead on

that basis as to the schedule

I have proposed and not make a negative

decision on Helsinki but hold it in abeyance as he thought it ve could lo

this and it not get mixed up in SAil talks, it would be a good idea. I said

it is a good listening post for information we might obtain, but on the

othor hand, if it would irritate the salt talks, I am willing to postrone it.

It. Rogers said that was good and we would do that then; that he

has spoken to paul raconber (illiam B. Macomber, Jr, Under secretary

lor nuministration), tho 1s an old-timer and a Republican and sort of ar

Aiministrative Assistant,

but he is the only one he has spoken to and the

only one who knows about

it, but he is willing to go ahoad and put him 11

bouch with anybody 1 vould like. I told him I would arrange lor ar

Assistant Director to get in touch with him and give the names of the

people we want to put in these places so the Ambassadors in turn can be

notified.

This summarizes the current status of our expansion of

our foreign liaison.

Following Mr. Sullivan's meeting with

Deputy Under Secretary of State Macomber on 11/20/70, State, who

had informed us that they would tell the interested embassies

that clearance had been granted for assignment of additional FBI

personnel abroad, forwarded cablegrams to the affected embassies.

One cable went to the four embassies where we are adding to an

existing office and another to the embassies where we propose to

open new offices, with the exception of Copenhagen, Denmark,

which had been the subject of our separate request

: 11/23/70.

Both cables asked the Ambassadors to advise immediately of any

difficulties foreseen.

Responses from the countries where we

now operate were prompt and favorable. Unfortunately, State,

in its cable to the new countries referred to our intention to

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

RE: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

Gentile telephoned 12/8/70 to advise that the

U. S. Ambassador in San Jose had described the exceptionally

large U. S. presence in this tiny country as "simply

overwhelming" and reminded State that it is trying to

sharply reduce the U. S. contingent there.

The Ambassador

recommended that if San Jose was considered essential, our

office be limited to one man who would be part of a new

"Office of Security" in the Embassy which would serve a

number of U.S. agencies. Gentile said that the concept

of an FBI office in Central America has definitely been

approved but the Ambassador is correct in pointing out

that state has insisted on reducing the U.s. delegation

in San Jose.

Gentile said State is most anxious to assist

in establishing an FBI liaison post in Central America and

asked whether an office in Managua, Nicaragua, San Salvador,

El salvador, or Panama City, Panama, would permit us to

carry out our mission as effectively as an office in

San Jose, Costa Rica.

From our standpoint, we can do this

from any

point in Central America.

As there is a strongly

pro-U. S. government in Nicaragua, the President of which

is personally known to'SA James A. Miller, who would become

Legat there, we could readily open in Managua rather than

San Jose.

This would require no additional training of

personnel or major alteration in our plans. Our intention

is to intensify our coverage of the seven Central American

countries and this can be handled very effectively from

Managua.

With respect to Copenhagen, action has been delayed

within State, according to Gentile,

because of the recent

incident involving the attempted defection of a Lithuanian

from a Soviet fishing vessel. The cable informing the Embassy

in Copenhagen laid for three days on the desk of Deputy

Under Secretary Macomber, who has been testifying before a

Congressional committee concerning State's part in that matter.

Gentile advised 12/8/70 that Macomber had just approved and

signed the cable and that he anticipates no difficulty or

delay in the opening of our office in Denmark.

Subject

The attached cable from the U. S. Ambassador at

San Jose refers to the establishment of a

"four-man FBI OffICe

in San Jose."

The Director inquired "Why did we ask for four

persons to be in San Jose."

The office which we proposed in San Jose would actually

be a regional office responsible for all of Central America.

We have heretofore covered five countries on a road trip basis

from Mexico, but the new office would have included Panama and

British Honduras, areas not previously covered but where a

number of leads

have arisen recently. There is a crying need

¡for quality intelligence reiating io this dieà resulting from

Ithe situation in Panama and acts of terrorism and violence in

Guatemala.

Honduras and El Salvador have recently been at war.

Bureau criminal work in Central America has consistently

increased in recent years.

The full time of one man has been

occupied in handling leads in five countries. Addition of a

second agent and location of the office within the territory

should

permit more prompt and thorough handling of our leads

as well

as the development of the high-level intelligence being

sought.

To handle the clerical and stenographic work for these

two agents, we recommended two clerical employees or a total of

four persons for the new office.

By separate memorandum, 12/8/70,

we recommended that the Central

American office be established

in Managua, Nicaragua, instead of San Jose because of the

"overwhelming" U. S. delegation presently in Costa Rica.

With respect to the comments of U. S. Ambassador Bunker,

Saigon, South Vietnam, the Director stated that the Ambassador's

requirement is unsatisfactory but typical and instructed that

the office be canceled.

In this regard the Director is, of

course, absolutely right in his comment concerning the

high-handed

remarks of Bunker. We are aware, however, that part of the

difficulty here lies with the State Department cable which

notified the embassies where we proposed to open new offices..

Memorandum to Mir.. C. D. Brennan

RE:

EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

SECRET

As discussed in my memorandum 12/8/70, a typographical

error in this cable resulted in the Ambassadors' being

informed that our liaison representatives would develop

and maintain a close cooperative relationship with the

policy agencies of the countries which they would cover

whereas State had been told that we would be developing

this relationship with police agencies. It is surprising

that more Ambassadors did not protest this apparent

intrusion into their personal responsibilities. We have

already pointed out this

error to state, who acknowledged

It and, in fact, state corrected this in a separate cable

to La Paz because the Ambassador there had made specific

reference to our contact with policy agencies. We feel

we should go on written record as well regarding this

erTOX.

ACTION:

If approved:

(1) The Administrative Division will promptly

cancel the transfers which have been issued to personnel

destined for Saigon, South Vietnam (one agent, one clerk).

• Canc. letters ou Robert A, Haulet Samara 7, Gahason

•[[ Regulations concerning the conduct and activities of employees are published in.

the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Iitle 28, Section 45•735.

Their source is

round generally 1n Departmental Order 350-05 dated 12-28-65 which provides that

employees shall:

(1)

Conduct themselves in a manner that creates and maintains respect for the

Department of Justice and the U. S. Government.

In all their activities.

personal and official, they should always be mindful of. the high standards of

behavior expected of

them.

(2)

Not give or in any way appear to give favored treatment or advantage to

any member of the public, including former employees, who appear before the

Department on their own behalf or on behalf of a nongovernmental person.

(3)

Avoid any action which might result in, or create the appearance of--

Using public office for private gain

(b)

Giving preferential treatment to any person

(c)

Impeding Government efficiency or economy

(e)

(f)

Losing complete independence or impartiality

Making a Government decision outside official channels; or

Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of

the Government

Departmental Order 350-65 further provides that an employee shall not have a direct

or indirect financial interest that conflicts, or appears to conflict, with his

Government duties and responsibilities.

Such

a conflict exists whenever the

performance of the duties of

an employee has or appears to have a direct and

jumble effect upon a financial interest of such employee di ci his spousa,

minor child, partner, person, or organization with which he is associated or is

negotiating for future employment.

A conflict of interest is deemed to exist even

though there is no reason to suppose that the employee will in fact resolve the

conflict to his own personal advantage rather than to that of the Government.

The order also provides that no Department of Justice employee shall participate

personally and substantially as a Government employee, through decision, approval,

disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation or otherwise,

In a judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other

determination, contract, claim,

his spouse,

minor child, partner, organization in which he is serving

to his knowledge as officer, director,

trustee, partner, or

employee, or any person or organization with whom he is

negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a

financial interest, unless authorized to do so by the Deputy Attorney General.

This prohibition includes such financial interests as ownership of securities of

corporations or other entities which may become involved in Bureau investigation.

The prohibited actions include supervisory decisions and recommendations, as well

as investigative activities.

Any employee receiving an assignment involving any

matters in which he has a direct or indirect financial interest as defined in

the departmental order shall immediately advise his superior and shall be relieved

of such assignment. Should there be a strong reason for requesting the Department's

approval for the employee to participate in the assignment, the matter should be

submitted to the Bureau for consideration regarding presentation to the Department.

In any event the employee should not participate in such assignment until the

Department's authorization has been received. The departmental order specifically

exempts from the above prohibition the stock, bond, or policy holdings of an

employee in a mutual fund, investment company, bank, or insurance company which

owns an interest in an entity involved in the

matter provided the fair value of

the employee's holding does not exceed one percent of the value of the reported

assets of the mutual fund, investment company, or bank.

THIT

CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES OF EMPT OYEES

In furtherance of the above, the Bureau expects its employees to so comport

themselves that their activities both on and off duty will not discredit either.

themselves or the Bureau.

Copies of Departmental Order 350-65 are furnished

to employees during their indoctrination on entering the Bureau's service.

Failure by an employee to follow these regulations will result in appropriate

disciplinary action including possible dismissal.

MISCONDUCT

There are actions the commission of omission of which, considered in light

of the Bureau's work and its responsibilities to the American people, is

prejudicial to good order and discipline.

These are other actions which, either

by commission or omission, are contrary to law.

Personal Misconduct

Employees should never cause themselves to be mentally or physically unfit

for duty.

They are not permitted to consume alcoholic beverages during

working

hours, including that time allotted for meal periods or any period

of leave taken if the employee intends to return to work before the

termination of working hours. They must not, at any time, engage in

criminal, dishonest, immoral

or disgraceful conduct or other conduct

prejudicial to the Government.

2.

Misuse of Government Property

All Government property, automobiles,

supplies, equipment, telephones,

and facilities are to be used solely

for official purposes and are not to

be converted to an employee's personal use. In this regard, however, the

use of equipment such as cameras for training and practice during nonwork

hours shall' be considered "official purposes."

Any loss, misplacement "pe

theft or destruction of Government property issued to an employee must

reported to his superior immediately.

Special Agents attending school under the Government Employees' Training

Act

as an official

assignment may avail themselves of stenographic and

tuning facilities in connection with their studies and preparation of

assignments provided the request for such assistance is specifically

approved in advance by the SAC or the ASAC.

This authorization does not

extend to employees attending school at their own expense or under Law

Enforcement Assistance Administration grants.

Employees are expected to take proper care of any Bureau property issued

to them or used by them.

No Bureau property,

other than that normally

associated with maintenance or use of the vehicle, may be left unattended

in a personally owned or Bureau automobile under any circumstances even

though the outside doors of the car are locked.

Personally owned weapons

authorized to be carried on official business are to be treated in same

manner as Bureau property.

Employees are responsible for complete

security of credentials, identification

cards and badges at all times. These items must be kept under

the employee's

control, should be immediately available, are to be displayed for official

purposes

employee in either oral or written form.

Only ASACS, SACS, Inspectors,

Assistant Directors, Assistants to the Director, Associate Director and

the Director are permitted to use personal cards for official business as

needed.

Agents are also permitted to use such cards; however, their contents are

limited to name and office telephone number.

Expenses incurred for print-

ing business cards are a personal obligation and are to be handled as such

by the employee concerned.

Three copies of the current business card

utilized by employees are to be forwarded to the Bureau for its records.

Employees are not to make copies for themselves of any reports or

correspondence they prepare in the course of their official duties except

copies of expense vouchers, Form CA-1 (Employee's notice of injury or

occupational disease), nor

should they make or maintain possession of

copies of official Bureau documents if they have no justifiable need

to know the information contained in them.

On separation from the Bureau,

every employee must return any official documents made or received while

in the Bureau's service except for items such as those enumerated above

and originals of letters of appointment, commendation, censure or

promotion. (See also Bureau rule on disclosure of information set out

in Section 1, B, 2, below and regulations set out in Part II, Section 4M,

[4m, Jof this manual

on disclosures of classified information).

Illegal Activities

Illegal

activities on the part of any employee, in addition to being

unlawful, reflect on the integrity of the FBI and betray the trust and

confidence placed in it by the American people.

Furthermore, unlawful

activities can disqualify him for employment by the Government of the

United States It 1s, therefore, expected that employees will obey not only

the letter of

but the spirit of the law as well whether they be

engaged in transactions of a personal or official nature. With respect to

investigative activities, this admonition particularly applies to entrap-

ment or the use of any other

procurement of evidence. In this regard, it should be especially noted that,

in securing information concerning mail matter, the Bureau will not

tolerate a violation of law (Iitle 18, USC, $$ 1702, 1703, 1708, and 1709).

Furthermore, employees must not tamper with, interfere with, or open mail

in violation of law nor aid, abet or condone the opening of

by any employee of the U. S. Postal, Service.

As members of a Federal investigative agency, FBI employees must at all

times zealously guard and defend the rights and liberties guaranteed to

all IndIviduals by the Constitution. Therefore, FBI employees must not

engage in any investigative activity which could abridge in any way the

rights guaranteed to a citizen of the United States by the Constitution

and under no circumstances shall employees of the FBI engage in any con-

o dignity of any citizen et in iza charactert zen at the inteeditates.

Employees must not install secret telephone systems of

microphones without

Bureau authority.

No brutality, physical violence, duress or intimidation of individuals by

our employees will be countenanced nor will force be used greater than

that necessary to effect arrest or for

self-defense.

Unethical Conduct

PART I'

SECTION 1. CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES OF EMPLOYEES

Specific prior Bureau authority is necessary in ordei

for an employee to

serve as an officer of a civic or other type of organization. Such

authority is also necessary before an employee can join an organization

where Bureau employment is a prerequisite.

It must also be obtained for

participation as a judge, sponsor or speaker in any public contest,

debate, forum or similar gathering in which the theme of the meeting

involves a controversial topic.

INo employee shall serve as range master or as a range officer at a com-

petitive firearms match unless the match is part of a training program

in which the FBI is officially participating and the instructor's

assignment in the match has been specifically approved by the Bureau in'

advance..

In addition, prior Bureau approval is needed for an employee to

attend, serve as an instructor, or assist in conducting seminars,

classes, or similar gatherings

where his FBI affiliation is known with

the exception of attendance as a student at a college, law school,

school of accounting or other recognized institution of learning.

This rule applies to all nonduty time, including leave, and in any case

in which a question arises as to the desirability of such participation.

Employees are forbidden to visit trials, hearings of court

sessions

in any court out of personal curiosity.

b. Gifts and Emoluments

FBI employment nor shall they accept fees

if such public appearance or the preparation of the speech, lecture,

or publication was part of an employee's official duties.

employee shall receive compensation or anything of monetary value for

any consultation, lecture, teaching, discussion, wilting, or appearance

the subiect matter of which is devoted substantially to the

responsibilities, programs or operations of the Department, or which

draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become

part of the body of public information. Further, in this regard, no

employee shall engage, with or without compensation, in teaching,

lecturing, or writing that is dependent on information obtained as

a result of his Government employment except when that information has

been made available to

the general public or when the Attorney General

gives written authorization for the use of nonpublic information

on the basis that such use is in the public interest. (see also

Item c below).

Bureau officials or other employees who speak of otherwise represent

the FBI at conferences, training sessions, banquets, meetings and

SECTION 1. CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES OF EMPLOYEES

1A

All employees must meet their financial obligations and, in addition,

the Bureau immediately.

Although employees will not be required to

pay unjustified claims, these matters should be resolved with reasonable

promptness. In this respect it should be noted that the U. S.

Internal Revenue Service may attach salaries of Federal employees who

refuse to pay delinquent taxes.

No employee shall use his Government employment (a) for a purpose that

is or gives the appearance of being motivated by the desire of private

gain for himself or any other person, or (b) to coerce, or give the

appearance of coercing, a person to provide a financial benefit to the

An employee shall not participate in any transaction concerning

purchase or sale of corporate stocks or bonds or of commodities

for

speculative purposes as distinguished from bona fide investment

purposes; nor shall any employee use, for the financial gain of

himself or another person, or make any other improper use of, whether

by direct action on his part or by counsel, recommendation, or

suggestion to another person, information which comes to the employee

by reason of his status as an employee and which has not become part of

the body of public information.

Further, no employee shall make

investments (a) in enterprises which, it

is reasonable to believe, will

be involved in decisions to be made by him, (b) on the basis of

information which comes to notice as the result of his employee status

and which has not become part of the body of public information, or

(c) which are reasonably likely to create any conflict in the proper

discharge of his official duties.

Employees must have sufficient funds at all times for current travel.

No employee shall accept free transportation for official or unofficial

purposes when the offer of such transportation might reasonably be

interpreted as an attempt to affect his impartiality.

He shall not

solicit or accept,

for himself or any other person, directly or

indirectly, any gift, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of

monetary value from a person who has or is

seeking contractual or

other business

or financial relations with the Department, is engaged

either as a principal or attorney in proceedings before the Department

of in court proceedings in which the U.S. is an adverse party, or

has interests that may

be substantially affected by. the performance

or nonperformance of his official duties. This prohibition does not,

however, prevent:

(a) solicitation or acceptance of anything from a

friend, parent, spouse, child, or other close relative when the

circumstances make it clear that the motivation is a personal or family

relationship; (b) acceptance of food and refreshments of nominal value

on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner

meeting or other meetings; (c) acceptance of loans from financial

institutions on customary terms for normal and ordinary activities such

as home mortgage loans; (d) receipt of genuine reimbursement, unless

prohibited by law, for actual expenses for travel and such othei

necessary subsistence for which no Government reimbursement is made

and provided the reimbursement is not excessive and employee is not

traveling on official business under Bureau orders; (e) acceptance of

an award for a meritorious public contribution or achievement.

SECTION 1• CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES OF EMPLOYEES

Failure on the part of an employee without good reason and in proper

and timely manner to honor debts acknowledged by him to be valid or

reduced to judgment by a court or to make or adhere to satisfactory

arrangements for settlement thereof may be cause for disciplinary action. .

Administrative Matters

(1)

Present Employees

Recommendations for the promotion of any employee shall cume only

from the official superior of the employee.

This procedure shall

be followed, too, concerning any recommendations tending to

initiate, retard, or rescind any order or administrative action

of the

Bureau.

Failure to abide by these regulations will

result in severe administrative action as well as possible

removal from the service.

No employee is to be advised of any pending, contemplated, or

recommended personnel action

(promotion, reassignment, transfer,

commendation, incentive award, disciplinary

action, and the like)

thereon has been

taken and he is officially notified.

In this regard it should be understood by all employees that the

matter of promotions, demotions, transfers, and any other similar

official personnel action must be decided

solely on the merits

of the individual case. The welfare of the Bureau must take

precedence over desires and convenience of the employee involved;

particularly with respect to transfers of investigative personnel

who are expected to be available for service wherever the needs of

the Bureau may require their assignment.

Any attempt, either

directly or indirectly, to bring outside influence to bear on the

Bureau to promote, rescind, or alter official actions in any

manner is contrary to the above-stated policy.

Employees should not instruct, or be concerned with the instruction,

of any person in preparation for examinations of the U. S.

regarding present or former employees should be reported

immediately to the Bureau.

Employees must not vouch

for any person or give testimonials,

Bureau approval except that SACs or division heads may approve

letters of recommendation prepared by employees in their offices

concerning individuals who are not present or former employees

of the FBI.

However, employees preparing such letters should

state therein that any recommendation is based on the personal

knowledge of the writer and should not be construed as an official

endorsement or recommendation of the FBI. All other letters

should be sent to the Bureau for approval. (See Part I, Section 16,

Subsection O, for detailed instructions concerning inquiries,

including those from duly accredited investigators.)

Investigative Operations

Employees should not conduct joint investigations with other Bureau

personnel without official permission; when such joint operation is

justified, required (as in certain civil rights cases), or desirable

as, for example, in sensitive or security-type interviews), the

appropriate supervisor may give permission for Agents of his

squad

to work together. If the circumstances require Agents from different

squads to work jointly, approval must be obtained from each squad

supervisor whose personnel are involved. In a resident agency, such

permission must be secured from the senior resident Agent.

When

employees receive such permission, they should show the joint

investigation on their #3 cards and daily reports (when such daily

reports are required by showing the name of the other Agent or Agents

and the file number of the case. Approval of #3 cards and daily

reports by the supervisors and senior resident Agent shall signify

that such permission was granted by them.

An Agent, whether assigned to a resident agency or the field office

headquarters city is not to visit his home during official working

hours without specific supervisory approval. Any such visit and

reasons therefor must be clearly shown on his #3 card and daily

report when prepared.

Employees must not participate indiscriminately in matters with

local law enforcement officers where no FBI jurisdiction exists.

Further,

they must tactfully decline to witness signed statements obtained by

local law enforcement officers where no FBI jurisdiction is involved.

In addition, no one other than persons officially connected with an

investigation of whose services are needed, should be permitted to

accompany our personnel on an investigation. In this regard, prior

[SAClauthority is necessary for members of law enforcement agencies

to accompany Agents during the course of security-type investigations.

PRESS POLICY

1. Confidential Nature of FBI Operations

See Part I, Section 1, page 9, paragraph B of Manual of Rules and

Regulations.

Title 28,

Section 50.2 of the Code of Federal Regulations concerning

release of information by personnel of

the Department of Justice

relating to criminal and civil proceedings states:

General. (1) The availability to news media of information in

criminal and civil cases is a matter which has become increasingly a

subject of concern in the administration of justice.

The purpose of

this statement is to formulate specific guidelines for the release of

such information by personnel of the Department of Justice:

While the release of information for the purpose of influencing

trial is, of course,

always improper, there are valid reasons for making

available to the public information about the administration of the law.

The task of striking a fair balance between the protection of individuals

accused of crime or involved in civil proceedings with the Government

and public understandings of the problems of controlling crime and

administering government depends largely on the exercise of sound judg-

ment by those responsible for administering the law and by representa-

tives of the press and other media.

"(3) Inasmuch as the Department of Justice has generally fulfilled

its responsibilities with awareness and understanding of the competing

needs in this area, this statement

to a considerable extent, reflects

and formalizes the

standards to which representatives of the Department

have adhered in the past.

Nonetheless, it will be helpful in ensuring

uniformity of practice to set forth the following guidelines for all

personnel of the Department of Justice.

Because of the difficulty and importance of the questions they

raise, it is felt that some portions of the matters covered by this

statement, such as the authorization to make available Federal con-

viction records and a description of items seized at the time of arrest,

should be the subject of continuing review and consideration by the

Department on the

basis of experience and suggestions from those within

and outside the Department.

Guidelines to criminal actions.

(1) These guidelines shall

apply to the release of information to news media from the time a

person is the subject of a criminal investigation until any proceeding

resulting from such as investigation has been terminated by trial or

otherwise.

At no time shall personnel of the Department of Justice furnish

a pending or future trial.

tions imposed by law or court rule or order, may make public the follow-

ing information:

"(8) This statement of policy is not intended to restrict the release

of information concerning

a defendant who is

a fugitive from justice.

Since the purpose of this statement is to set forth generally

applicable guidelines, there will, of course, be situations in which

it will limit the release of information which would not be prejudicial

under the particular circumstances.

If a representative of the Depart-

ment believes that in the interest of the fair administration of justice

and the law enforcement process information beyond these guidelines

should be released, in a particular case, he shall request the permis

sion of the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General to do so.

Guidelines to civil actions.

Personnel of the Department of

Justice associated with a civil action shall not during its investiga-

tion or litigation make or participate in making an extrajudicial

statement, other than a quotation from or reference to public records,

which a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of

public communication if there is a reasonable likelihood that such dis-

semination will interfere with a fair trial and which relates to:

Evidence regarding the occurrence or transaction involved.

"(2) The character, credibility, or criminal records of a party, wit-

The performance or results of any examinations or tests or the

refusal or failure of a party to submit to such.

"(4) An opinion as to the merits of the claims or defenses of a party,

except as required by law or administrative rule.

Any other matter reasonably likely to interfere with a fair trial

of the action."

News Releases

Fairness, accuracy,

and sensitivity to the rights of defendants, as

vell as to the public's right to know, must prevail in all dealings

with the news media. Favoritism should be shown toward no newsman

or no news medium.

Information concerning the FBI, including information regarding arrests

and other developments in cases investigated by the FBI, is disclosed

to news media, including newspapers, news magazines, news services, and

cadio and television networks or stations,

(a)

as news releases or

announcements, initiated by the FBI, and (b) as responses to inquiries

emanating from newsmen•

Each field office should maintain a control file containing all news

releases issued by the office since the last inspection.

"One-Office' news releases

The vast majority of news releases made by field offices are issued

to announce arrests in FBI cases.

The provisions of Section 50.2

If an SAC feels that an exception

to those provisions should de made in any individual case, he should

make his views known to the Assistant Directors of (a)

the sub-

the External Affairs Division.

Exceptions to the instructions provided in Section 50.2 can be

All news releases made by field offices should be issued over the

They should be issued to all interested news media

in the field office territory as simultaneously as possible; and they

should provide as full an account of the facts as can be disclosed

within the provisions of Section 50.2.

In news releases announcing

arrests or other developments attributable to the joint efforts of

the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, appropriate recognition

SACs may authorize other experienced Special Agents, including

Resident Agents, In their lleld offices to read or deliver news

However, those special Agents

should not expand upon the information in the news releases; and

they should answer any inquiry or request for additional informa-

tion by courteously telling the newsman involved that his inquiry

or request will be brought to the attention of the SAC as quickly

as possible for his consideration and action.

The reason for the

policy of referring all such matters to the SAC is to assure both

uniformity and

accuracy of any supplemental information that is

So as to minimize the opportunities for criminal elements to

harass Special Agents and their families, neither photographs nor

biographical sketches of Special Agents

should be made available

to news media in connection with news releases, announcements, or

inquiries pertaining to FBI investigations•

The sole exception is

in the case of employees who are killed in line of duty, in which

instances the release of photographs and biographical data should

be coordinated

with the Administrative Division and the External

Affairs Division.

"Multi-Office" news releases

News releases announcing arrests or other important developments

in wide-ranging investigations often require close coordination

and simultaneous release to the press by two or more field offices.

The External Affairs Division should be consulted before any such

news release is made,

and consideration should be given to the

question of whether

national news release is merited.

National news releases

As a general rule, national news releases announcing arrests or other

investigative developments are issued only in exceptional cases

involving (1) prominent persons, such as well-known business and

civic leaders, entertainers, athletes, or officials of local, county,

state, or Federal Government; (2)

persons of national notoriety,

as members of the "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives"; (3) persons

arrested for crimes that have attracted nationwide interest, such

as prevailed in the 1950 robbery of Brink's Inc., at Boston,

Massachusetts, and the 1964 murder of three young civil rights workers

Mississippi; and (4)

persons whose crimes nave

who have fled abroad.

should assure that the essential facts of all such cases, including

anticipated developments therein, are promptly brought to the atten-

tion of the External Affairs Division on a continuing basis.

National news releases generally will be issued in Washington, D. C.

SACs of those offices can make them available to local news

4. News Media Inquiries

There are two categories of news media inquiries. The first involves

routine inquiries received at the field office regarding either investi-

gative or administrative matters.

These should be answered by the SAC

or ASAC within the guidelines indicated above.

In responding to such inquiries,

SACs and ASACs should be courteous,

factual, and as helpful as possible. They should, however, avoic

answering hypothetical questions or

questions that would require them

to express personal opinions on matters of intense local or national

controversy.

The second category involves inquiries from the news media in emergency

situations. Often these are received by Special Agents at the scenes

of arrests, gun battles,

or other fast-moving developments in investigations.

Unless undercover assignments or similar overriding circumstances dic-

• tate otherwise, Special Agents who are approached by newsmen at the scenes

of fast-moving developments in FBI cases should (a)

identify themselves

as "a Special Agent of

furnish the name of the field office

to white they are assigned and" (e) state tee dal rested the arres

tigative operations,

as "'We are here to serve an arrest (or a search)

warrant."

Requests

for additional information should be answered by

courteously referring the newsman to the field office or to the tem-

porary field headquarters if such a temporary field headquarters has

been established in the area.

Only SACs or ASACs should participate in question-and-answer interviews

with representatives of any news medium at the scenes of fast-moving

In emergency situations, however, Special

Agents can relay reporters' questions to the SAC by telephone or radio;

and the SAC's responses thereto can be furnished to the reporters in

In other than such emergency situa-

cIons, special Agents should courteously refer newsmen to the SAC or

ASAC for answers to their questions: and Special Agents! investigative

résponsibilities attendant to such fast-moving developments must take

precedence over question's or inquiries of newsmen.

No FBI employee should knowingly furnish an erroneous, deceptive, or

misleading answer to a news media inquiry. In the overwhelming majority

of cases, an unequivocal and definitive answer can be given reporters'

questions regarding whether the FBI is, or is not, investigating a

specific criminal act,

as well as the reason why we have or have not

instituted investigation.

However, in kidnap-for-ransom cases and

related crimes involving a threat against human life, neither the fact

that the crime has occurred, nor the fact that the FBI is investigating

it, should be disclosed or confirmed without the approval of the sub-

stantive investigative division and the External Affairs Division.

Due to the sensitivity of many banking-type institutions to publicity

concerning the amount of loot obtained in robberies, burglaries

arcentes of financial institutions, such information should not be

disclosed to news media without the concurrence of the General Investi-

gative Division and the External Affairs Division.

SECTION 6: PUBLICATIONS, PRESS, AND PUBLIC CONTACIS

6A

Under no clrcumstances should any employee ask or suggest that a news-

man withhold information from the public without the concurrence of the

substantive investigative division and the External Affairs Division.

Fugitive Publicity

releases and other public disclosures designed to solicit public

cooperation in the apprehension of FBI fugitives may contain more facts

about the fugitive's criminal background than are permissible in news

releases and

• announcements regarding arrests.

In publicity regarding FBI fugitives, extreme care should be taken to

avoid statements that brand a fugitive as guilty of a crime for which

he has not been convicted. Arrest numbers or other data that identify

a photograph as having been made in connection with a past arrest or

imprisonment should not appear in photographs of fugitives that are

furnished to news media.

Field offices should coordinate all fugitive publicity with the Special

: Investigative Division and the External Affairs Division;, and they should

not hesitate to consult the External Affairs Division regarding ques-

tions or problems that arise in any area of news media relations.

Liaison With News Media

SACs who consider it necessary or advisable to do so may use one or

more experienced Special Agents to assist in facilitating prompt and

effective liaison with

the news media.

Such Agents will not be spokes-

men for their field offices.

They may furnish information to news

media in the

SAC's name after it has been approved by the SAC. They

also may assist in preparing news releases, às well as responses to

news media inquiries.

These Agents should

devote no more time to such

news media liaison duties than is absolutely necessary•

It is the intent of these guidelines to facilitate a more open stance

and, thereby, a mutually beneficial relationship between FBI and news

media representatives.

as well as other employees acting for them

in news media

relations, should be as responsive as practical and pos-

sible to inquiries and requests made by newsmen. The term "No comment"

should be avoided except when its use is absolutely necessary. If an

SAC does not know the answer to a newsman's question, he should have no

hesitancy in stating, "I don't know," and/or, depending upon the nature

of the inquiry, telling the newsman

that he will contact him (the news-

man) as soon as he has information that can be furnished to him.

SACs should avail themselves of every opportunity to meet and become

well acquainted with leading citizens throughout their field divisions,

including representatives of all important news media. They should seek

as well

as an official, relationship with these

individuals to the fullest extent that the demands of other duties make

possible.]

Purchase of individual publications at Bureau request

When the Bureau requests a field office to purchase and forward one

or more copies of publications of security interest, it is desired,

unless otherwise specifically stated,

that nonevidentiary copies be

With respect to these specific Bureau requests for the

purchase of individual copies of publications,

the reguested

evidentiary copies should be forwarded to the Bureau by routing slip

via ordinary mail.

BUREAU-WIDE INFORMATION PROGRAM REGARDING MATTERS OF NATIONAL INTEREST

This program is coordinated by the External Affairs Division and is devoted

primarily to supplying SACs facts regarding current happenings, including

both administrative and investigative developments, that are topics of

nationwide press coverage and public interest.

All such communications to SACs bear the caption "BUREAU-WIDE INFORMATION

PROGRAM"' and are in the form of either teletypes or airtels, dependent upon

the exigencies of the situation.

The purpose of this program is to assure that each SAC possesses the key

facts concerning important happenings anywhere within the FBI that command

widespread public interest. Information furnished to SACs under this program

should prove helpful to them, as well as to other FBI personnel, in answer-

ing questions, correcting misunderstandings, and dispelling false rumors

that may exist either within of without the ranks of the FBI. In some

instances, however, the information may be of such a nature that it cannot

e disclosed in whole or in part to outsiders. In fact, occasionally it is

necessary to restrict discussion and disclosure of the information even withir

FBIHQ and field offices.

Guidelines furnished on each communication should

be strictly followed.

FBIHQ and field office personnel should promptly bring to the attention of

the External Affairs Division all current items and developments that they

feel merit consideration for inclusion under this program.

Quality salary increases are to recognize and to reward on a continuing

They are intended to motivate employees to perform continuously

at their full

capacity and

to make salaries relate more closely to the

nature of the assignment and the competence with which they are performed.

Quality increases may be given to all employees of the Bureau who are

presently paid under the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, on a

their grade.

His work has been highly effective. Include where possible

specific examples.

This exceptional high level of effectiveness has been sustained

a period of time no less than six months and will continue

indefinitely.

Primary consideration is to be given for quality

salary increases at the time annual performance ratings are sub-

mitted when high level performance must have been sustained

the entire rating year.

When viewed as a whole employee's performance merits a faster :

than normal

salary advancement.

A quality increase is more suitable recognition than a cash award

Relationship to regular within-grade increases

Quality increases are in addition to regular within-grade increases

for "acceptable level of competence." An employee who receives a

quality increase does not thereby

start a new waiting period for his

regular within-grade increase.

If, however, such quality increase

places employee in step 4 or step 7 of his grade, he must then com-

plete the additional waiting period of 52 weeks required by law toward

Relationship to Outstanding annual performance ratings,

An employee who meets the standards for an Outstanding annual perform-

ance rating would generally meet the standards for a quality increase.

However, other circumstances (e.g., a recent quality increase, cash

or honorary award, or application of other policy, regulations, or

law may make a quality increase inappropriate at

the time.

This does

limit quality increases only to those who receive Outstanding

annual ratings.

The standards for quality increases were purposely

made less demanding and more flexible for recognizing and encouraging

especially effective job performance of employees who are unable

meet all of the qualifications for an Outstanding rating but who

"perform functions

of their position" in a

sustained superior manner

and give promise of continuing at this level.

Authority

The Director of the FBI is authorized to give final approval for its

incentive awards up to and including $1,000.

Awards in excess oi

$1,000 will be referred to the Department for approval. It is the

Bureau's policy to afford normal management review and

control proc-

esses to identify program or operational areas where superior work

results warrant award consideration. l

3. [Suggestion awards]

Employees are encouraged to submit to the Director ideas to improve

the efficiency and economy of the Bureau's operations.

A form, FD-252,

is available for use in

submitting suggestions although they may be

submitted in any manner desired.

An original and two copies of each

suggestion are to be submitted. If the suggestion concerns a form,

ten copies

of the proposed form are to be submitted.

Suggestions are

to be submitted without delay to the Director.

or benefits, buildings and grounds, routine safety practices, litems of

supply which[ canlbe

procured through simple requisition, or proposals

which offer no specific means to improve operations [will not be en-

tered into the suggestion award system unless it can be shown they

contribute to economy, efficiency, or increased effectiveness of

operations.

While these ideas are welcome,

they are properly part of

the normal

employee-management communications and should be promptly

routed to the appropriate official concerned.] Similarly, ideas to

improve working conditions which could and should have been corrected

through normal or customary action by the employee or supervisor are

tions such as these and suggestions submitted which are trivial in

nature or which would obviously cost more to process than any saving

they could achieve will not be evaluated under the suggestion program

but will be returned to the appropriate supervisor for oral acknowl-

A suggestion made by an employee, but not adopted when made, shall

remain active for

period of two years.

Adoption of suggestion within

two-year period after it is submitted will entitle original suggester

to reconsideration for appropriate award. Suggestion becomes void if

not adopted within two years.

If two or more employees independently submit identical suggestions

simultaneously, any award granted will be divided among employees

making the suggestion.

No employee's annual salary rate shall be affected by any award granted

under this

program.

Awards as high as $25,000 may be granted with the approval of

The amount of an award for intangible benefits is

determined by the

value of the employee's contribution and

its

application

The minimum award off$25]will

not

be granted unless the contribution compares favorably with

those receiving the

instances involving personal danger or risk, lthe degree

personal danger or

risk will be considered, along with the value

of the employee's

contribution, in determining the amount of the

award.

The

table set out below in item 4d is used

in determining

the amount of such

awards. ]

[g.]

Group awards

Contributions made by a group of two or more employees, with all

members of the group

contributing, including supervisors, may be

rewarded by a group

award to be shared equally among the group

or with each member being rewarded in proportion to his contribution.

The total of such a group award will normally be the amount author-

ized for that type award if made to one individual. Any exceptions

recommended should be fully documented with an explanation as to why

should not be followed. Groups may also receive

honorary awards if the facts so justify.

Special achievement awards

For sustained high level performance,

major duties of the position

must be performed for a period of at least six months in a manner

clearly exceeding normal requirements, or performed in a highly sat-

isfactory manner for such a period characterized by abnormal work

load, temporary shortage of personnel, or other unusual circumstances.

Awards for

sustained high level performance should not have been

granted within the six months preceding the date of nomination.

When

other awards can be

justified,

awards based

on superior performance

should

not be granted on a repetitive basis.

Dear Mr. Haldeman:

By letter dated September 21, 1970, addressed to the

President, I outlined the manner in which this Bureau might expand

Its coverage abroad in an effort to produce intelligence information of

a high quality.

After giving further consideration to this matter, I would like

to advise you that it is my feeling that the opening of an FBI liaison

office in Beirut, Lebanon, would place us in an area where we might be

able to develop intelligence data relating particularly to the Middle East

situation. Accordingly, with the President's approval, I will establish

a liaison office in Beirut.

Sincerely yours,

SUBJECT:

EXPANSION OF FBITOREIGN COVERACT

Late yesterday I received a call from Major General Alexander

Haig, Advisor to the President on Foreign Affairs,

in the office of

Dr. Henry Kissinger. He said that he was with the President, at the

time the conversation took place with the Director, relative to

opening some new FBI liaison offices and adding men to some of those

already insexistence.

He said he thought it was an excellent idea

and just wanted to pass on to the Bureau his own reaction. He said

Dr. Kissinger certainly shares this same viewpoint.

Subject to Criminal Sanctions

General Haig went on to explain that this country needs more

high-quality intelligence and a greater knowledge, in depth, of

what is going on in the troubled areas of the world.

He inquired

where some of our new offices might be. I did not want to be

definitive on the matter, but pointed out that the Director was

giving consideration to opening some offices where, as he indicated,

there was trouble, and where it was important for the United States

to have high-quality information relative thereto.

I said the

Director was therefore considering countries like

Israel, Venezuela,

Lebanon, Finland, Bolivia, and the addition oi some men in other

offices, such as

BuEnos AIres.

General Haig said this is good, and he added that he thought

it especially important for us to open offices in Israel, Lebanon

and Finland.

He said that he will be out of the country

for awhile

I wished him a

safe trip and this terminated the conversation.

RULES PERTAINING TO THE GENERAL INDEX

OLD CARDS

(O1d German, Miscellaneous, Bureau Section and Mexican)

are cards referring to old files. These files mainly

concern World War I, and cards pertaining to them are being

removed from the General Index and microfilmed.

PARENTHESIS

Words in parenthesis should be disregarded in filing.

Formerly Spanish names were written with part of the name

in parenthesis.

Disregard in filing cards.

Example:

LOPEZ, JUAN (Y RODRIGUEZ) will be filed in the same place

in the index as LOPEZ, JUAN.

Exception:

Mrs. in parenthosis, if already in the index should be

regarded if used with a masculine name as :

JONES, HERMAN. (MRS.)

## Page 135

ABBREVIATIONS

When

an abbreviation is known or readily available, the Classifiers

should write out the full name of the particular abbreviation and the

typist should prepare the cards fully written out.

Abbreviations auto-

matically recognized by anyone handling cards should be given to their

supervisor. The exceptions to the above rule are in titles of books,

newspapers, editorials,

etc. in which abbreviations appear. These

tin an aboreviations

abbreviations should not be

written out but should be filed and cards made

exactly as the title is set forth in the mail. Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation and United States of America should always be written or typed in

the abbreviated form, as f.B.I. and U.S.A. Czechoslovakia and variations

such as Czechoslovakian will be abbreviated Czech (per Streamlining

Committee 9-14-66).

National Crime Information Center will be abbreviated

N.C.I.C. (per Agent's conference 2-2-71).

ADDRESS CARDS

There are two breakdowns for address cards, one for Domestic and one

for Foreign. Domestic address cards are filed numerically within the

state breakdown, irrespective of city. Foreign address cards are filed

numerically within the country breakdowns, irrespective of the city.

Main

see cards are filed in strict numerical order within the State or

Country breakdown. The cards are made as follows:

A. DOMESTIC

818 Nichols St., Greenwich, Conn.

CONNECTICUT

ADDRESS

GREENWICH

818 Nichols St.

Post Office Box #2345, Chicago, Ill., Franklin Station

ADDRESS

ILLINOIS

Chicago

P.0. Box 2345

Franklin Station

B. CARDS BEARING NEW YORK ADDRESSES

It is characteristic of some New York City addresses to

contain dashes (-) as shown in the following example.

Such addresses will be treated as follows:

(a) Address - 158-22, 142nd St., NYC

ADDRESS

NEW YORK

NEW YORK

158-22, 142nd 'St.

When a dash (- appears on the mail, the typist is to

type the dash on the card as shown above.

This card indicates

that "158" is the block number and the "22" is the house number.

in the 158th block of 142nd Street. It will be filed numerically

as "15822" in the New York breakdown regardless of the city.

This is not to be confused with house numbers that cover

more than one street address as this is a common practice not

only in New York but throughout the United States. In these

cases two cards are to be made.

Examples:

(b) Address - 96-100 Broadway, NYC

(1) ADDRESS

NEW YORK

NEW YORK

96 Broadway

96-100 Broadway (dropped down two spaces)

same manner as the domestic address cards, that is, main

and see cards are filed numerically within a country breakdown

regardless of the city. House numbers, P.O. numbers, street

numbers, etc. are to be regarded in filing as the case may be.

D. CHINESE AND JAPANESE NAMES

Chinese names are searched three ways

if

no part of the name is

anglicized, however, only one card is made.

The Classifying Unit will circle all parts of the name of a

main subject provided no part of the name is anglicized. Cross

indexing will be indicated on but one part of the name.

Example:

If a portion of the name is capitalized or punctuated to

indicate the surname, the card will be made on the indicated surname.

CHEN Ise Tung; CHEN, Ise-Tung; Chen, Tse Tung.

Above name will be circled by the Classifier on all three parts

of the name but cross indexed on "CHEN" only.

The Main Card Searcher will search the name three ways.

However,

only one card will be made using "CHEN" as the surname.

CHEN, TSE TUNG (The hyphen should not appear on the card.)

If the name is not set out as above, the Classifier will again

circle all parts of the name but cross index the last part of the ame

only.

SAC is to insure that requested advance is justified and

sufficient to coincide with particular needs of each undercover

Agent.

It must be realized

these undercover operations do

not enjoy unlimited financial backing Expenditures

concerning each operation must be logical and completely

justified and will receive close supervision at FBIHQ consistent

with overall needs of the beau.

6.

When Agents areutilized on special assignments, it is frequently

necessary to obtain a suitable vehicle to facilitate their

movement among targeted groups and make their cover more

attractive to those targeted.

should be registered in cover identity as would

under normal circumstances.

Insure adequate insurance is

obtained under cover identity to protect cover and personnel

involved.

The cost should be handled the same as other routine

expenses

incurred in these operations.

From a liability viewpoint, vehicles operated in this manner

are in fact Government vehicles and being operated on official

business by a Goverument employee. Government liability would

surface, for example,

in the event liability on part of Agent

in an at fault accident was in excess of that provided by

insurance carried.

FBIHQ must be advised of full details

where any insurance claims are encountered involving a cover

identity

G. Safeguards

1. Bureau property of Agents on these assignments is not to

be maintained on their person or premises and such property

should be maintained securely in office of SAC

Where circumstances warrant it in the personal

judgement of the SAC, an appropriate firearm and

credentials may be issued to the Agent on covert

assignment phile these

circumstances exist

2.

If arrested while on assignment by local authorities and

Agent and others in his group are represented by an

attorney, Agent should not report on the attorney-client

relationship of others involved in such an arrest.

To

withdraw from the attorney-cllent relationship would

draw immediate attention and suspicion to the Agent

RE :

Revolutionary Activities

Informant Program (Extremist)

CC:

HOETTIN

.m.1.

BACKGROUND:

To insure our sensitive operations involving under-

cover Agents are afforded maximum security at FBI Headquarters

and the field, memorandum dated 9/6/72 captioned "Revölutionary

Activities - Violence; Internal Security - Revolutionary

Activities," approved

by then Acting Director L. P. Gray

authorized furnishing selected SACs, who may be involved in

these operations, with "Working Guide for Utilization of

Undercover Special Agents," hereafter referred to as Working

Guide.

The Working Guide sets forth objectives of

captioned program and enumerates guidelines (mostly administra-

tive in nature) regarding the

operation of this program which

has been in effect

for slightly over one year.

During

period a number of additional instructions concerning

this

administrative aspects of this program have been furnished

interested offices by separate communications.

A careful review of the substantive aspects of this

program for the past year has disclosed a need to bring to

the attention of involved SACs certain operational instructions

concerning utilization of undercover Agents.

These instructions

are believed necessary based upon our investigative experience

since the inception of this program, to insure that certain

practices, not in the best interests of the FBI, are avoided.

Apropos of the foregoing the following instructions are set

1. Headquarters authority is required for targeting

or retargeting of undercover Agents.

SACS' have been given considerable latitude in

selecting targets for undercover Agents which

targets must then be submitted to Headquarters

for approval.

Inasmuch as undercover Agent

targeting goes to the heart of this program,

close Headquarters supervision is essential

to

insure utilization of this technique is

restricted to the

purposes for which this pro-

gram was established; namely, to locate and

the Weatherman underground apparatus.

essential,

therefore, that Headquarters approval

be obtained for target selection and no change

in such target be made without prior Headquarters

approval.

2.

Undercover Agents are not to be utilized

In routine surveillance operations.

It is a recognized fact that revolutionaries

are extremely conscious of the surveillance

technique and would go to considerable lengths

to expose ia: surveillance.

To assure maximum

protection for this program, it is essential

that undercover sources, established after a

considerable investment

money, and

effort, not be utilized

for routine physical

surveillance operations which are properly

the responsibility of regularly assigned

personnel.

Participating SACs must be made

aware that despite the excellent cover these

undercover Agents provide for physical surveil-

lance operations, such utilization could lead

to exposure of this technique or compromise of

an individual undercover Agent and, therefore,.

is not authorized.

3. Undercover Agents must operate independently

of one another.

It must be anticipated that in the event one of

our undercover Agents is compromised, considerable

effort will be expended by certain segments of

the news media, revolutionary activists, New Left

attorneys, and

others of similar persuasion, to

determine whether additional FBI undercover

personnel are engaged in the same operation as

the

compromised undercover Agent and, if so, can

the

related FBI personnel be uncovered. It is

essential, therefore, should one of our under-

cover Agents be compromised, that the damage be

confined to that one situation and there be no

way of linking the compromised undercover Agent

with other undercover operations. To insure this

situation does not occur, our undercover Agents

must operaté independently of one another.

4. Undercover Agents are not to be utilized in

conjunction with conventionally attired Special

Agent personnel.

Utilization of undercover Agents in conjunction

with conventionally attired Special Agent

personnel greatly increases the possibility

the undercover Agent will be identified as a

law enforcement operative and thereby be

compromised.

This, of course, does not preclude

contact of an undercover Agent with his

handling Agent made under completely secure

conditions.

It is acknowledged concerning the above that a par

ticularly exigent situation may dictate the utilization of an

undercover Agent or Agents in contradiction to the above

instructions.

In such instances attempts must be made to

obtain prior

Headquarters approval, telephonically it necessary.

Should circumstances preclude obtaining Headquarters authority,

however, approval to utilize undercover Agents contrary to

the above instructions must be obtained from the SAC (or in his

absence, from his designated representative, and Headquarters

advised

immediately thereafter with complete justification set

forth concerning the action taken.

As noted supra; additional administrative instructions

have been

furnished interested pifices by separate communications

since the last compleie

updating of the Working Guide.

believed these instructions should now be incorporated into ta

appropriate section of the Working Guide.

E. Inspection Matters

The Inspector is to personally handle this phase of

inspections (or is absolurely essential the Number One Man).

There

should be no discussion among the Inspection Stair of these

matters.

After an inspection begins, the Inspector will receive from the

office of the Assistant Director,

Inspection Division, a writ -up

identifying the undercover operations in existence in

the office.

Early in the inspection the following snould be done:

I. Review the undercover Agent's 134 file in the field

Review pertinent substantive files tbat show results of

the undercover operation

3. Discuss with the SAC what administrative devices are in

existence. This includes any written instructions to the

undercover Agents,

the method used by the office in

contacting the Agent and the method used by the Agent iu.

contacting the office.

Also, revier reports or other

communications submitted by the undercover Agent which

account for his activities and whereabouts

4.

Review the security procedures in effect in the office to

assure that all logical precautions are being taisen.

Determine the reasonableness of the cover being used

by the Agent and-sieps taken to document his cover story.

Check for conformity to the general guidelines contained

the other sections of this working guide

5.

Intervier the undercover Agent. The SAC should be recuretod

to arrange for the time and place of the meeting so that it

will be afforded maxinum security and introduce the

Inspector to the Agent. It is realized that there may be

rate instances when it will not be feasible to interview

an undercover Agent during an inspection.

After the SAC puts his addendum on the memo, the original

memo with addendum should be left with the SAC for filing in the

134 file maintained in that Division after any necessary action is

taken.

Under no circunstances are any copies to be made of this

memn except the

one copy indicated above. The undercover operation

and the undercover Agents are not to be commented on in any place

in the inspection work papers, write-ups, or lettex. Appropriate

comments concerning an undercover operation may be included in the

inspection sunmary prepared for The Director.

The Inspector should discuss with Assistant Director,

Inspection Division, any prollems you encounter in this phase of

the inspection.

F. Funds

1. Normally accrued expenses by undercover Agents will be clained

from Confidential Fund. Blue slip submitted for expense

will show symbol number followed by designation (Extremist)

and code name. Blue slip, consistent with security and

where

no receipt under Agent's assumed name is sent, will contain

breakdown generally itemizing manner in which

such expenses

were incurred. At no time should names of targeès be mentioned

in itemization.

2.

Receipts will be obtained under assumed name where practical.

Bureau authority is to be requested for unusual or out of the

ordinary expenses incurred in connection with these assignents

3. Per diem accrued while on this assignment and travel

expenses incurred

in connection with same may be claimed

on regularly submitted monthly expense voucher. If

receipt obtained under assumed identity, SAC, on note

attached to voucher, will stipulate no receipts attached

due to confidential

5.

When an undercover Agent incurs regularly anticipated

expenses in connection with a special assignment such as rent,

utilities for an apartment and/oi vehicle expenses, SAC is

authorized to advance funds from the Confidential Fund to

cover such expenses. Specifically, then these expenses e

and give same to undercover Agent. Receipts for payments

will

be given contacting Agent at time of next contact who

will have them properly recorded in Confidential Fund records.

See item F I on handling if no receipts obtained.

SAC is to insure that requested advance is justified and

sufficient to coincide with particular needs of each undercover

Agent. It must be realized these undercover operations do

not enjoy unlimited financial backing. Expenditures

concerning each operation must be logical and completely

justified and will receive close supervision at FBIHQ consistent

with overall needs of the Bureau. Headquarters teletype

12/19/72 should be cited on ID-37 as authority for expenditures

in these matters.

Instructions set forth in Headquarters

apply' in thesa matters.

6.

When Agents are utilized on special assignments, it is frequently

necessary to obtain a suitable vehicle to facilitate their

movement anong targeted groups and make their cover more

attractive to those targeted.

To insure adequate cover for personnel involved, the vehicle

should be registered in cover identity as would be done

under normal circumstances. Insure adequate insurance is

obtained under cover identity to protect cover and personnel

involved. The cost should be handled the same as other

routine expenses incurred in these operations.

From a liability viewpoint, vehicles operated in this manner

are in fact Government vehicles and being operated on official

business by a Government employee. Government liability would

surface, for example, in the event liability on part of Agant

in an at fault accident was in excess of

: that provided by

insurance carried. FBIHQ must be advised of full details

where any insurance claims are encountered involving a cover

identity.

When an Agent leaves undercover assignment it sometimes will

Do necessary for an office to sell the vehicle used by hig

in this assignment for security reasons.

Since this vehicle

Is not part of the office complement and was purchased

through the Confidential Fund any proceeds from the sale of

the vehicle should be applied back to the Confidential Fund.

A check for the proceeds from the sale should ba submitted

to Headquarters and made payable to Treasurer of the United

States.

This check should be a cashiers check and not a

In connection with these assignments from time to time

It may be necessary for undercover Agents, under their

assumed names, to gain employment.

• Io insure rederal and

Iocal tax laws are adhered to,

certain procedures are to

be taken in these matters.

Withholding tax is to be taken

out of wages consistent with Federal and local ragulations.

A Federal and State tax return, whan due, is to be tilou

under the Agent's assumed identity: Wages earned by an

Agent in these assignments should be placed in cash (no

checks or cover identity reference) in his own personal

checking account and he should prepare a check in this

amount under his true identity payable to the Treasurer

of the United States.

A cover communication is to be

submitted with check under true name caption oi Agent.

This communication will state that in connection with

The same

procedure would be used upon refund of any taxes paid

under cover identity.

Copies of all tax forms submitted

In these operations are to be maintained in the appropriate

field 134 file on the source involved along with material

pertaining to any refunds.

Safeguards

1.

Bureau property of Agents on these assignments is not to

be maintained on their person or premises and such property

should be maintained securely in office of SAC

2.

Where circumstances warrant it in the personal

judgement of the SAC, an appropriate firearm and

credentials may be issued to the Agent on covert

assignment while these circumstances exist.

2. If arrested while on assignment by local authorities and

per day, seven days a weeks assignment). On the form

FD-329

(overtime card) there should be

posted in a

normal working pattern sufficient overtime that the

card for a given month will average out to 109 minutes

per day or higher.

In this regard, insure the average

achieved is compatible with other Agents on regular

investigative matters so that overtime of undercover

Agent is not highlighted and appears as an exception.

Re:

Revolutionary Activities

Informant Program (Extremist)

and intelligence interest to this Bureau dealing with deserters,

Selective Service violators, and sundry other matters

which information would not have been available through

any other means.

While Headquarters is pleased with the results

obtained from this progran,

experience thus far has demon-

strated a need to establish the following operational guidelines

which must be strictly adhered to in utilization of

undercover Agents:

I. Targets for undercover Agents should receive

prior Headquarters clearance. No changes

in target assignments or undercover Agent

involvement in

premeditated precipitative-type

action should occur without first obtaining

Headquarters authority.

20:

Undercover Agents involved in this program should

not be utilized for routine surveillance

purposes.

Revolutionaries are extremely

conscious of the surveillance technique and

will go to great lengühs to expose a

surveillance. The investment represented

in these undercover Agents precludes their

utilization in routine surveillances which

should be handled by regularly assigned

personnel.

3. Undercover Agents involved in this program

should operate independently of one another.

Such proceduze is essential to insure that

the

activities of a compronised Agent cannot be

traced to and cause the compronise of another

undercover operation.

4. Undercover Agents involved in this program

should not be utilized on assignments in

conjunction with conventionally attired Agent

perconnel. Thie, of course, aces not pertain

the handling Agent made vivir

Memorandum to Mr. Tolson

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache, Copenhagen SECRET

Scandinavian countries in the past to initiate operations against the United States;

similar instructions issued concerning the Chinese communists. Danish Security

"Service recently furnished information of value concerning Soviet KGB officer who

passed through Denmark. Since Scandinavian countries are recognized haven for

draft dodgers and New Left fugitives, Inspector instructed Legat to request back-

ground data and photographs of extremist fugitives for alerting cooperative police

services in territory. Office is showing steady improvement in providing HILEV

information. Only 4 items worthy of dissemination to White House submitted

1/1 - 7/31/71, but 3 such items furnished in August for total of 7. Inspector placed

strong emphasis on this phase of Legat's responsibilities. Legat and Assistant

I recognize importance and have specific plans for expansion of program. Legat

of definite opinion majority of accomplishments to date achieved only because of

personal contact by our Agents. This is especially noticeable in our Selective

Service and Deserter cases in Sweden, where 21 Bureau fugitives and 7 Selective

Service delinquents have been located even though official government position is

to provide asylum for persons who refuse military service for 'humanitarian or

political reasons." No substantive errors detected.

Aaministrative Operations - Excellent. Legat is capably administering office,

with Chief Clerk's Office running smoothly and work current; stenographic production

above average. Continued close attention to all administrative operations emphasized

by Inspector.

Personnel Matters - Very Good. Personnel complement of 2 Agents and 2 clerko

stenographers. Case load per Agent below average, but substantial increase each

month (up from 43 on 6/30/71 to 91 as of 8/25/71). Considering case load,

geographical area covered, potential for HILEV and other factors, present com-

plement considered adequate but not excessive to handle responsibilities at this

time. Legat instructed to follow closely. Both Agents available; neither overweight

or on limited duty. Morale appears high.

Contacts - Excellent. Effective liaison program in effect and being expanded with

a number of new contacts established since office opened; others previously developed

are becoming more productive. Contacts are diversitied; both American and

foreign; and are scattered throughout territory covered. All met by Inspector

expressed highest regard for Director and FBI as well as our local personnel, and

expressed appreciation for having Bureau representatives in Copenhagen.

Panther Party (BPP) in Switzerland and to gain access to data concerning accounts

in Swiss banks used for funding BPP.

While five high-level intelligence items submitted by Bern have been dissemi-

nated to White House, Legat instructed to devote more time and penetrative attention

to this important program; Legat has positive attitude toward program. He is of

opinion large majority of accomplishments, whether in criminal, security or intel-

ligence field, would.not have been possible without presence of Legat. No substantive

errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Excellent (Last Inspection - Very Good). Office staffed

by experienced Legat and one clerk-stenographer; well administered. Chief Clerk's

Office operating efficiently; form errors below average and down from last inspection.

Stenographic production substantially above average

with retypes low. Continued.

close attention to all administrative operations stressed.

Personnel Matters - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Complement of one

Agent and one clerk-stenographer (same as last inspection) considered adequate to

handle liaison and other responsibilities. Legat agrees. Agent not overweight,

unavailable or on limited duty. Close professional working relationship between

Agent and clerk-stenographer; morale appears high.

Contacts - Very Good (Last Inspection - Excellent). Legat has congenial and

productive liaison with wide range of agencies and individuals, both American and

foreign. Instructions issued to strengthen liaison to insure Legat is promptly

notified concerning proposed visits to U. S. by high Swiss officials in order that

any courtesies which might be appropriate in furtherance of Bureau's best interests

can be arranged (Legat was not promptly advised of plans of Swiss Attorney General

(to visit U. S. and Bureau headquarters). All persons met by Inspector expressed

high regard for and confidence in Director, FBI and our personnel in Bern.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Henry D. Grush, GS-17 at $34, 716, aged 56, veteran, not on probation,

Legal Attache since 12/5/62. Is reserved, businesslike and dependable. Most

knowledgeable concerning Swiss government, laws and people. Grush is linguist

capable of handling several languages. Qualified to continue as Legal Attache.

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache, Bern

2. The Bern Office covers Switzerland, which is a stable and conservative

country. It may not offer the same potential for high-level intelligence as do some

other territories, but positive items have been developed and should continue.

Swiss banks have long been recognized as the repository for funds illegally acquired

by Americans, now including some of the Black Panthers. We have made some

progress in gaining access to these funds and findings of Inspector (together with

prospects for signing mutual legal aid treaty between Switzerland and U. S.)

indicate further success through close personal liaison is possible and probable.

The existing case load, combined with these other considerations, justifies

continuance of our Legat in Bern. It 15,

therefore, recommended that the office

of the Legal Attache in Bern be continued with the present complement of one Agent

¡determined experienced clerical employee (Miss Cuddy) capable of reviewing and

processing much of this material. Assignment of this clerk-stenographer full time

fugitives and/or Selective Service delinquents in last 12 months. Valuable infor-

mation also developed in several car theft ring cases, major thefts in U. S. and

activities in Black Panther movement in Algeria. While I HlleV items worthy of

cussemination to the White House (3 in August) have been submitted, there is a

definite need for expansion and intensification.

Positive program for this purpose

properly maintained. Travel, contact and per diem expenses consistent with efficient,

productive operation. Suggestion made for strengthening accountability for items

disseminated. Format used in letters to outside agencies corrected.

plishments which should improve as operation becomes better established.

42 subjects of Bureau security cases residing in territory. Legat's coverage of

Security Index subjects and subjects of security cases effective and Bureau's interests

being protécted. 52 fugitives and Selective Service delinquents located in territory

over past Fiscal Year (50 for previous Fiscal Year). 8 informal deportations

effected.

Since inception of high-level intelligence (HILEV program (9/70), Legat has

I submittea 1 items to Bureau, only 5 of which have been disseminated to white House

Participation Significantly below average of other Legats. Lack of attention to this

program highlighted by Inspector and instructions issued to vigorously pursue and

develop high-level intelligence sources and contacts. Legat reminded of President's

contemplated travel to Peking and instructed to maintain close contact with all

individuals in a position to furnish advance' information concerning plans of subversive

elements and organizations to foment demonstrations in opposition to President's

Ivisit.

Administrative Operations - Fair, (Last Inspection - Very Good). Chief Clerk's Office

well organized, with slight backlog in project and pending work. Misfiled index cards

are below average. Form errors slightly above field average, with substantial

reduction over previous inspection. Stenographic production high with no delinquency.

Voluntaxy overtime essential, productive and being equitably shared.

HILEV Program not being afforded desired prompt, penetrative, aggressive

and imaginative investigative and administrative attention. Administrative write-up

prepared pointing out weaknesses in investigative and administrative handling of this

program (copy attached). Legat Grove instructed to fully comply with Bureau instruc-

tions intensifying the development of high-level intelligence sources and contacts so

vitally needed, thus enabling the Bureau to fulfill its obligations. Deficiencies

detected in Legat Grove's handling of HILEV Program necessitate downgrading of

administrative operations to Fair.

Personnel Matters - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Complement of 2 Agents

and 2 clerk-stenographers (same as last inspection). Legat requested one additional

Agent and one additional clerk based on assigned case load, vastness of territory

covered and additional responsibilities. Work load, road trips, and overall respon-

Sibilities closely analyzed by Inspector justifying only present complement of 2 Agents

and 2 clerks - Legat agreed. Training procedures effective. No Agents overweight,

unavailable or on limited duty. Morale appears high.

Contacts - Very Good (Last Inspection - Excellent). Effective sources and contacts

exist at all levels of police and security organizations, insuring investigative respon-

sibilities being properly handled. 45 new sources developed since previous inspection.

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache SECRET

Hong Kong

84 National Academy graduates occupy responsible positions throughout territory

covered. Two additional candidates presently attending National Academy session.

Sources and contacts so urgently required in connection with HILEY Program need

further

attention.

n. Persons contacted by Inspector spoke highly of the Director,

FBI and Hong Kong personnel.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Daniel A. Grove, GS-16 at $29, 067, aged 41, veteran, not on probation,

Legal Liaison Officer, Hong Kong, since 4/17/66. He makes an excellent per-

sonal appearance, is intelligent and has been most effective in establishing liaison

contacts who can assist the FBI in handling normal investigative matters. He has

an excellent command of the Chinese - Mandarin language. Since the previous

inspection Legat Grove has failed to fully comply with Bureau instructions in

aggressively obtaining intelligence data vitally needed under the HILEV Program

I (Administrative write-up attached). His failure to develop sources and contacts

¡capable of producing high-level intelligence data as urgently needed, and his

(marginal administration of this important program warrant administrative action.

Therefore, it is recommended that he be retained as Legat but censured and placed

on probation. If approved, letter attached.

Assistant Legal Liaison Officer, Hong Kong, since 12/15/70. Maurice has an

excellent personality and presents a most businesslike appearance. He is mature,

to handle assigned duties. He is considered qualified to continue in present assign

ment.

Communist China and Hong Kong itself thrives with CHICOM activity. An extremely

high potential exists for the development of intelligence data so vitally needed to

fulfill our obligations concerning the internal security of the United States and our

additional responsibility to the President. It is essential that our office in Hong

Kong be retained since it has produced some high-level intelligence data of interest

to us and, due to its strategic location, has the potential of obtaining highly sensitive

information which would otherwise not be available.

Legal Attache at Managua since 12/27/70.

He makes an excellent, mature appear-

ance and seems interested and enthusiastic. He was involved in a

substantive error

write-up and an administrative write-up (copies attached). Error related to excessive

delay (12/14/70 to 6/7/71) in verifying address in Nicaragua of Selective Service

subject. Miller explained the delay was due to opening of new office and case not

received at Managua until 3/2/71; that he initiated action 3/3/71 but made no record

of itse Fixplanation unacceptable. Miller was assigned case in Mexico City, 12/14/70,

and sent to Managua by Mexico City 1/21/71. Records at Mexico City reflect serials

received Managua 1/25/71. File shows no action taken by Miller until 5/4/71.

Subject's address in Managua verified 6/7/71.

Material relating to latter sources improperly placed in fileon office administration.

Miller explained he has other sources but maintains no

the Legat; he utilized the office administration file number to sign out on when making

contacts; he made no entries for contacts after hours; and information concerning

possible sources was mistakenly directed to office administration file.

This is Miller's first assignment as Legat -- his previous duties related

primarily to a road trip out of Mexico City. He needs additional time to develop

ability to administer and direct Legat operations. In view of the deficiencies

detected, recommend Miller be censured and placed on probation. Letter attached

for approval will summarize inspection results and advise him of censure and

probation.

Memorandum to Mr. Tolson

Inspection - Office of Legal Attache

SECRET

Criminal informant strength improved since last inspection - further improvement

ordered. Substantial contributions made by office in securing high-level intelligence

of interest to Bureau and White House. Particularly significant information developed

regarding recent student demonstrations in Mexico, Soviet and North Korean training

of Mexican guerillas and matters involving Mexico - Cuba relations. This phase of

operation emphasized by Inspector. No substantive errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Supervision

equitably shared between Legat and Assistant Legat. Chief Clerk's Office well organized

and functioning efficiently. Pending work and project work above average - attributable

to new Bureau-authorized file destruction program. Intensification of destruction

ordered. Form errors below average. Misfiled index cards average for offices of

Similar size and below overall field average. Stenographic production above field

average; no retypes or delinquencies. Travel and communications expenses reduced;

slight increase in per diem costs -- justified. Confidential Fund closely controlled.

Recommendation made for strengthening accounting procedures with respect to

informant payments. Overtime essential, productive and equitably shared. Trend

memoranda prepared calling for better protection of informant identity in communica-

tions and destruction of informant memoranda no longer needed.

Personnel Matters - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Personnel complement

7/12/71, 23 (11 Agents, including Legat and Assistant Legat; 12 clerks). Inspector

considers clerical complement excessive by one stenographer; Legat agrees.

Reduction

ordered by attrition. Agent complement reduced by one since last inspection due to

opening new Legat in Managua, Nicaragua. Territory covered by Mexico City reduced

correspondingly. Agent complement adequate, but not excessive. No Agents on

limited duty, probation, overweight or unavailable. No training weaknesses noted.

Personnel represent U. S. Government in efficient and effective manner. Morale

appears very high.

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). The two FBI National Academy

(NA) graduates who occupied positions of importance in agencies within Legat territory

were replaced with administration change in Mexico in December, 1970. Mexican

authorities encouraged to nominate qualified police officers for NA to upgrade law

enforcement.

Excellent network of contacts maintained on operational and executive

levels of Mexican Government and police agencies. Contacts among U. S. agencies

indicate effective relationships. All officials contacted by Inspector hold Director,

FBI and Legat personnel in extremely high esteem.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Robert T. Nischwitz, GS-16 at $29, 067, aged 47, veteran, not on probation,

Legal Attache at Mexico City since 4/27/70, second office as Legat. Nischwitz makes

an excellent, mature appearance. He possesses effective leadership qualities; is a

2. John J. Foarde, Jr., GS-15 at $26, 675, aged 47, veteran, not on probation,

Assistant Legal Attache and Number One Man at Mexico City since 4/20/66. Un-

available during inspection due to serious illness (hepatitis). Legat advised he makes

a mature, businesslike appearance and has pleasant personality. Considered

conscientious, hard working, and a capable administrator. Legat rates him excellent,

noting he has served in current assignment five years, demonstrating effective

leadership and ability. Results of inspection tend to substantiate these comments.

Recommend Foarde continue in his present position.

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache

Ottawa, Canada

SECRET

Administrative Operations - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Form errors

above field average.

Weaknesses ordered corrected. Misfiled index cards below

field average. Suggestions made regarding preparation and destruction of index cards

to alleviate space problem. Trend detected in failure of clerical personnel to initial

incoming and outgoing mail - ordered corrected. Communications, travel, per diem

and contact costs down. Economy stressed.

Personnel Matters - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Personnel comple-

ment 2 Agents, 4 clerk-stenographers - increase of one clerk-stenographer since

last inspection. Staff adequate, but not excessive. Morale high, overtime productive.

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Relationship with RCMP

excellent. Quality liaison contacts maintained on all levels. All officials contacted

expressed high regard for FBI and Legat personnel.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Recommended that Legat Office, Ottawa, be retained. The relationship

between U. S. and Canada brought about by common border, similar domestic

problems and constant travel between countries of dangerous New Left and black

extremists requires daily contact with liaison sources regarding these problems.

Potential for Chinese communist intelligence activity directed against U. S. from

Canada is also paramount. Existence of Legat, Ottawa, is also beneficial in locatio

of various types of fugitives of interest to us as well as monetary recoveries.

2. Moss Lee Innes, aged 50, GS-16 at $31, 881, veteran, not on probation,

at Ottawa Since 4/19/59. Presents impressive personal appearance, is mature

and extremely able liaison representative. Qualified to continue as Legat. Attacher

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache

SECRET

since they are charged with responsibility for gathering positive intelligence infor-

mation even from friendly nations, and our employees on foreign assignment could

be possible targets. Noting probability Chinese communists will be admitted to

United Nations and, therefore, have Mission in New York in near future, Legat

instructed to be especially alert for information of value concerning modus operandi

of Chinese Communist Intelligence Service (CHICOM) from experience of French

security forces since diplomatic relations have existed between France and CHICOMS

for extended period. Considerable support in France of Eldridge Cleaver faction

of Black Panther Party; effective coverage through French criminal and security

services. Favorable results achieved in recent months in acquiring HILEV data of

interest to President - 38 HILE items submitted; 21 disseminated to White House

(10 to White House in June - July). High priority this important program strongly

emphasized

l by Inspector to all personnel.. Legat recognizes importance and has

positive plans for expansion of sources.

No substantive errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Legat and

clerical staff are well experienced in foreign operations and office is effectively

administered. Inspector suggested in interest of closer supervision and fixing of

responsibility that Legat prepare written instructions setting forth guidelines for

division of work between him and the two assistants. Legat agreed and this has

been done. Minor corrections ordered in Defense Plans. Chief Clerk's Office

operating efficiently; work current and form errors below average. Stenographic

production high with retypes low. Continued close attention to all administrative

operations stressed.

Personnel Matters - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Personnel comple-

ment of 3 Agents and 3 clerk-stenographers considered optimum number for handling

Liaison and other responsibilities. Overtime essential, productive and equitably

shared. No Agents unavailable, overweight or on limited duty. Staff working as

team and morale appears high.

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Effective liaison maintained

with diversified and productive contacts, both American and foreign. All met by

Inspector were cordial and expressed high regard for and confidence in Director,

FBI, and Paris personnel.

2. Mike G. Zinck, GS-14 at $22, 897, aged 41, veteran, not on probation

Assistant Legat since 12/22/70 and Number One Man since 8/20/71. Zinck makes

excellent initial impression, is personable, experienced in foreign operations,

hard worker and qualified to continue as Assistant Legat.

3. The case load of investigative matters, as well as the important liaison

and intelligence responsibilities in the countries covered by Paris, justifies

continuance of our Legal Attache Office there. It is recommended, therefore,

that the office of Legal Attache in Paris be continued with the present complement

of 3 Agents and 3 clerk-stenographers.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN OPERATIONS - LEGAL ATTACHE OFFICES (LEGAT)

PURPOSE: To summarize views of Bureau officials and set forth recommendations

of Inspection Division relative to retention of 17 existing Legats,.

recommend opening of 6 more, and reopen Resident Agency in Mexico.

Mamall

Ottawa, Paris, Rome and Tokyo. In September, 1970, the President in conversation

with the Director requested that we expand our foreign operations because of the

President's desire for better intelligence. The President also discussed this with

the Secretary of State who advised that he thought it was a good idea. As a result,

6 additional offices were opened in the latter part of December, 1970 (Beirut, Caracas,

Copenhagen, La Paz, Managua and Tel Aviv). These were opened based on the opinion

of the President and Dr. Kissinger that our Legats were furnishing highly valuable.

I information of interest to the White House.

On the basis of our productivity in obtaining high-level information, the

President again requested (May, 1971) the Director to consider further foreign office

expansion. In response to this, at Director's request Domestic Intelligence Division

| (DID) recommended reopening our offices in Manila, Rio de Janeiro and Santo Domings

and opening new offices at Canberra, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi. DID also

Madrid and Tokyo.

Barud

Mir. Sullivan had approved of the 6 additional Legats opened in December, 1970,

and, in fact, personally initiated the recommendation of one of them (Beirut) /4He had

not previously expressed opposition to the expansion of our foreign liaison operations,

but in a memorandum 6/7/71 Mr. Sullivan expressed the strong opinion that the

proposed addition of Agent personnel abroad and reopening or opening of new offices

should not be accomplished as he felt that many of our Legats were not furnishing

inforination and services sufficiently valuable to justify their retention. In his memor-

andum 6/16/71 Mr. Sullivan recommended our offices at Bern, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong,

Madrid and Tokyo should be closed. With regard to Beirut,

Caracas, Copenhagen,

Lá 2a7, Managua and Tel Aviy (openea December, 1970, with his approvai) Mr.

Sullivan said he Seriously doubted the value of these offices and recommended they

Re: Foreign Operations - Legats

Santo Domingo, Canberra, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi.

INSPECTION DIVISION EVALUATION:

Based on the divergence of opinion the Director ordered immediate inspections

of all existing Legats. These inspections have been completed and separate memoranda

have gone forward justifying the retention of all 17 existing offices. Retention has been

based primarily on our success in obtaining high level items of interest to the White

House

"As of 8/3l/7i, 52iitems had been submitted to the Bureau by these offices,

of which 295 had been disseminated to the White House. Numerous favorable

comments have been received from the White House. In each instance the Director

concurred with recommendations that the 17 existing offices be continued.

It had been suggested by the DID that our coverage could be stepped up by

increasing our complement in Beirut, Caracas, London, Madrid and Tokyo.

As a

result of our inspection an additional Agent was recommended for London and this

Mexico, should be reopened to cover a vast region now handled as a road trip.

should be staffed by personnel already assigned to our Mexico City Office. Addition

of personnel to other Legat Offices is not recommended,

ariant Isratan +711522579

As indicated, it was recommended that offices be opened in Canberra, Kuala

Lumpur, Manila, New Delhi, Rio de Janeiro and Santo Domingo: Based on the desires

jof the White House for additional high-level intelligence and our past successes

in this area, it is felt that we should advise the President that we are ready,to

go forward with this expansion, if that is still his desire, at any time he wishes.

Reopening Manila would relieve Hong Kong of a long road trip and provide closer

attention to mounting political developments in China. Reopening Rio de Janeiro

would relieve Buenos Aires of a 25,000 mile road trip and provide on the -spot

coverage in this important area (Brazil) which is larger than the United States.

Reopening Santo Domingo would relieve San Juan Office of road trip and furnish

prompt coverage not only of Dominican Republic but of current political developments

in Haiti. Canberra would cover Australia and New Zealand, relieving Hong Kong

of the road trip. Kuala Lumpur would cover Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and

mitiate coverage in indonesia, would relieve Hong Kong of road trip and provide

more rapid coverage of area currently politically important. New Debli would

cover India, Hast and West Pakistan and Nepal, an area where we previously had

no coverage, but where potential for political intelligence is high.

QUOTA OF FBI EMPLOYEES ON FOREIGN ASSIGNMENT:

Our quota of personnel on foreign assignment authorized by State Department

When it was approved that we add'l Agent to London, it was decided to move

in Agent from Buenos Aires to London to stay within our quota. Subsequently,

James A. Miller was removed as Legat at Managua, and it was recommended and

approved that Managua operate with only I man until the full potential of that office

could be determined. Thus we presently have 87 employees on foreign assignment,

I under our quota. As we may have to replace Agent in Buenos Aires or Managua, we

Snould not reduce our quota.

In its recommendation of 5/28/71 for expansion of Legat operations, DID

recommended staffing the 6 proposed offices as follows:

Agents

20

While this staffing appears to be reasonable, in view of the present concern

for economy and the balance of payments problem, it would appear preterable to

start each of these offices with only one Agent and one clerk. Thus, we would be

increasing the number of Bureau employees on foreign assignment by l2 rather than

20, and doing not that which is desirable but that which is essential.

The opening of the proposed 6 offices with one Agent and one clerk each would

increase our present

quota

of personnel on foreign assignment from 88to 100.

This would be presented to State Department for its approval after discussion

with the President and/or Dr. Kissinger.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

That we retain our 17 existing Legal Attache Offices.

periodic security checks made of our space. Office is neat, well arranged and

maintained, but extremely crowded. Legat instructed to pursue negotiations with

Embassy officials for additional space, contiguous to existing space if possible,

but office may have to move to another floor in same building. Legat to furnish

estimates and recommendations to Bureau before making any commitments. No

Bureau cars assigned.

12-month period case load and cases closed per Agent well above average each

Communications Intercept Service

(CIS), which makes available information concerning mail sent from United States

to persons in East Germany, continues to produce valuable material, including

information on Left Wing organizations in U. S. and travel of Security Index subjects

and communists to Eastern Bloc.

Increasing volume of material (over 5600 items

since last inspection) has burdened both Agent and clerical personnel. (Material

is provided in raw form and must be translated -- if in German -- analyzed,

searched and transmitted to Bureau.) Since April, 1971, necessary to transmit some

items to Bureau in bulk without benefit of thorough analysis in Bonn Office.

determined experienced clerical employee (Miss Cuddy) capable of reviewing and

processing much of this material. Assignment of this clerk-stenographer full time

to project would release Agent personnel to handle other important responsibilities,

I primarily in the field of gathering high-level intelligence (HILEV). Since last

inspection 78 Security Index subjects known to have visited or resided in Bonn

territory; 76 other security subjects known to be residing these countries. Sources

providing coverage on activities. In criminal field Bonn reported location of 22

fugitives and/or Selective Service delinquents in last 12 months. Valuable infor-

mation also developed in several car theft ring cases, major thefts in U. S. and

activities in Black Panther movement in Algeria. While 7 HILEV items worthy of *

dissemination to the White House (3 in August) have been submitted, there is a

definite need for expansion and intensification.

Positive program for this purpose

outlined. Legat of definite opinion great majority accomplishments in all areas

achieved only because of presence our personnel and would not have been possible

through normal diplomatic channels. No substantive errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Office is

capably administered. Chief Clerk's Office operating efficiently and work current.

Stenographic production above average even though time spent on clerical duties

is high. Continued close attention to all administrative functions stressed.

Personnel Matters - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Personnel comple-

ment 3 Agents and 4 clerk-stenographers (2 Agents and 3 clerk-stenographers last

inspection). Thorough analysis by Inspector of work load, types of cases, and

experience of personnel determined Agents required to spend too much time in

office handling high volume of security matters (Communications Intercept Service).

Overtime essential, productive and equitably shared. Time in office higher than

should be due to above-mentioned processing of mail. Morale appears high.

Language, /ability Agent personnel satisfactory.

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Productive and cordial liaison

maintained with diversified contacts, both American and foreign, throughout territory.

Legat recognizes need for cultivating and expanding contacts, especially in HILEV

field. Instructed to do so. All contacts expressed highest regard for and confidence

in Director and our Bonn personnel.

9. Polygraph or lie detector

General information

(1)

The polygraph is an instrument designed to record psycho-

physiological responses during a carefully controlled inter-

rogation which may indicate deception when properly evaluated by

the examiner. (Relative changes in blood pressure, heart rate,

respiration, and psychogalvanic skin responses.)

(2)

Special Agents trained as polygraph examiners are strategically

located throughout the field.

(3) Opinions from interpretations of polygraph examinations are

generally not admissible in court.

(4) Statements made while polygraph used and admissions obtained

are admissible as evidence.

b. Policy

(1) The FBI does not consider the polygraph technique sufficiently

precise to permit absolute judgment of guilt or nonguilt (lie

or truth) without qualifications.

{2)

The poiygraph is used seieviively as an iuvesiigaiirê aiu ând

the results are considered within the context of a complete

investigation.

The polygraph can be helpful to implement an

interrogation and provide investigative direction, but the FBI

does not rely

on it solely or use it as a substitute for logical

investigation.

(3)

(4)

FBIHQ must authorize use in every instance.

FD-328 "Consent to Interview With Polygraph" must be signed by

each person prior to examination. The consent forms and

graph charts should be retained

as exhibits in case file.

(5)

FBIHQ will not authorize outside agency polygraph use in Bureau

case and generally will not make available polygraph examinations

for outside agency in non-Bureau matters. Exceptions will be

considered on individual basis.

Brief description of

tests

a.

Benzidine test - A preliminary test. Does not identify. Only indicates

possible presence.

1) Materials needed - Chemically pure benzidine, ethyl alcohol,

lacetic acid, normal

(2)

Mixing benzidine solution - About 1/16 teaspoon of benzidinelpowder]

in 2 ounces of alcoholland add several drops of glacial

acetic acial

(3)

Mixing normal saline - About one tablespoon salt per quart of

(4)

Procedure for making test - Rub cotton swab soaked in saline over

edge of suspect stain until slight amount dissolves on swab. Add

drop or two of benzidine solution to swab followed by drop or two

of hydrogen peroxide.

Immediate blue color indicates possibility

of blood.

(5)

Substance

not blood if no immediate blue color appears.

Precautions

necessary to conclusive testing - Always use fresh

benzidine solution.

Always add solution to swabs, never to stain

itself.

Minimum size of groupable bloodstain - fairly heavy stain measuring

1" by z" in size

4. How to submit bloodstained items

Necessary to dry stains before wrapping to avoid putrefaction

Dry by exposure to atmosphere in

well-ventilated room.

In arying, avoid exposure to diréct sunlight, artificial heat, or air-

blast of a fan.

d.

e.

Wrap each item separately.

Small particles, such as fingernail scrapings, should be placed in

[roundlpill boxes sealed with tape.

In removing stained portions of objects for submission, include some

adjacent unstained material for control test purposes.

§ Heavy specimens submitted in wooden boxes should be held in place

securely by wooden cleats or beavy nails and wires.

Precautions to be considered

(1)

Submit to Laboratory as soon as possible after withdrawal of

sample.

(2)

Send separately, never in large box with other specimens coming

by mail or express.

(3)

Send registered airmail, special delivery.

(4)

Use no refrigerantsibut

small amount of preservative and anti-

coagulant recommended. j

1. Field FM radio matters

Facilities

An FM radio station is installed in each field division headquarters

city to provide voice communication between the field division office

und Agents operating two-way radio

cars in theldivision. FM radio

stations are also provided inmost resident agency cities. FM two-

way radio cars are provided each field division for car-to-car and

car-to-station voice communication.

Portable FM radio equipment is

furnished each field division to provide voice communication from

the person or from temporary fixed locations to the FM radio stations

and/or FM two-way radio cars.

bo

Utilization

The field office FM radio stations are used each working day for rou-

tine communications matters, as well as for any special investigative

situations which arise. The resident agency FM radio stations are

used whenever required by investigative operations and are to be

turned "on" whenever an Agent is in the office.

Agents are requirec

to have automobile two-way radios "on" whenever they arelin the vehicle.]

They should make full use of two-way radio cars and radio station

facilities to obtain increased investigative efficiency, as well as

reduced communications costs.

Portable equipment should be utilizec

as necessary in individual investigative situations.

Identification

Listed below are official field office FM radio station call

signs and car prefixes for each field division.

used by cars are composed of either (a) the appropriate prefix

followed by a number arbitrarily assigned to the car by the

• field office or (b) the permanent number assigned the can by

the Bureau without any prefix.

The car prefixes are identical

to office teletype designations.

They are used to avoid con-

fusion with the arbitrarily numbered cars of other field offices.

Speaker identification

All speaker

identification examinations are made by the Radio Ingineering

Section, FBI Laboratory.

b. Definition

Speaker identification is a technique of comparing questioned

recordings for the purpose of

providing investigative guidance in selected Bureau cases.

Speaker identification is not sufficiently authenticated to serve

means of identification with subsequent court testimony

to that effect.

The comparison of voices for speaker identification

and the examination of tape recordings are not

services which will

be provided to local law enforcement

agencies.

d.

Procedure for obtaining and

transmitting specimens

It is desirable to obtain as many of

combinations used in the questioned recording as possible

when making known recordings.

The vocal transition from

word to another influences the

voice picture;

therefore,

best comparisons are achieved when

words are used in the

same sequence.

Recordings should be as good technically as possible.

(4)

Recordings should be

at any standard

tape recording

speed;

i.e., 7.5

(5)

inches per

results will be obtained if recordings are made with a

full-track recorder at 7.5 inches per second.

(6)

Use standard recording tape.

If possible, do not use "extended

play, "

"long play," or tapes with

base less than 1.5 mils.

In December, 1972, former Acting Director L. Patrick Gray,

III, dissolved what was then known as the Crime Research Division. Prior

to Mr. Gray's arrival, this was for many years known as the Crime Records

Division; however, Mr. Gray changed the name to Crime Research Division.

Quite frankly, at the time Mr, Gray made his decision to dissolve the

division I was opposed to such action as were several Assistant Directors.

Nevertheless, Mr. Gray went ahead on the basis of a study that had been made;

however, the origin of this study is not known to me nor have the results ever

been located to my knowledge. Upon the dissolving of the division; the various

segments that previously constituted the division have been spread out in several

divisions and the result has been overlapping of responsibilities, lack of

-. coordination and a situation which simply does not lend itself to efficient

operations as we have known them to be for many years at FBIHQ.

To give an idea as to how fragmented this division has become, the

Press Services Office and Congressional Liaison are now handled out of your

office; tours are handled out of the Administrative Division; correspondence

and research matters out of the Files and Communications Division; fugitive

publicity out of the Special Investigative Division; and special memoranda out ot

the General Investigative Division.

An indication of how chaotic the situation

has been is evidenced by the fact that the Correspondence Section, after

abolishment of the division, was assigned to my office and subsequently we

prevailed upon Mr. Gray to assign it to Files and Communications Division.

It is true that this former division did handle public relations-type

functions; however, in doing so they were in effect promoting cur investigative

interests which is the very reason for the FBI's existence. On the other hand,

a great portion of the work in this former division was one of service, not only

to the other divisions but to our field office operations. For example, the

division handled aimost all of the corressandence emanating trom FBita,

which ran into thousands of communications/each year. They raadled al

speech matters, publication of the Law Enforcement Bulletin and the

Investigator; they prepared byline articles; statements by the Director;

speeches for the Director; press releases; and publicity concerning appre-

hension of fugitives and the Top Ten program. When the division was intact,

it was kept informed of matters of pertinence to the Bureau so that they could

effectively discharge their responsibilities at one central location. As it is

now, there is a lack of coordination and in time I strongly feel that it will.

work to the severe detriment of the FBI.

This situation was discussed in detail at an Executives' Conference

meeting held in my office on 5/24/73. Those in attendance were Messrs.

Baker, Callahan, Gebhardt, Marshall, Soyars, Thompson, Walters, Inspector

White for Mr. Conrad, Section Chief Brownfield for Mr. Jenkins, Inspector

Moore for Mr. Miller, and Inspectors Campbell and Bassett from my office.

It was the unanimous recommendation of those present that the division be

- re-established.

I have enclosed a proposed organizational chart which shows the

organizational breakdown of the suggested division. As you will note under the

proposal, the Press Services Office and Congressional Liaison office, now

assigned to your office, would be placed back into this division as these functions

were previously handled in the old Crime Research Division.

There was also discussed at the above Executives' Conference meeting

a proposed name, should you agree to establish a new division. Its prior name

of Crime Records is really a misnomer, since our crime records are actuaily

kept and published by our Computer Systems Division. Crime Research does

not adequately describe the division; however, I do believe that the name of

Correspondence and Services Division would adequately describe the basic

functions of this division.

RECOMMENDATION:

Submitted for your consideration and approval.

As a matter of background, in December, 1972, former Acting

Director L. Patrick Gray, III, dissolved what was then known as the Crime

Research Division (Mr. Gray had changed it to this name from Crime Records

Division). It is my understanding that Mr. Gray took this action based on a study

that had been made; however, nothing is known as to the origin of thisstudy nor

have the results ever been located to my knowledge. I might add that former

Acting Associate Director W. Mark Felt likewise knew nothing as to the origin

or the results of thistudy. It is known that Mr. Gray's decision to dissolve the

division was not shared by several Assistant Directors and while there is nothing

in writing it is my understanding that perhaps the main reason for Mr. Gray

taking this action was his belief that that division was responsible for several

leaks that had appeared in the newspaper which were detrimental to Mr. Gray's

administration of the FBI. I am not aware, however, of the validity of this

observation but it is merely set forth so that you may have a complete picture

as to the circumstances surrounding the dissolvement of the Crime Research

Division.

In any. event, upon dissolving of the division various segments that

previously constituted the division were spread out throughout the Bureau and

while we have been able to put part of it back together there is a lack of coordina-

tion which amounts to a decentralization of responsibilities which definitely does

not lend itself to the efficient operations of the Bureau.

To give an idea as to how fragmented this division has become, the

Press Services Office and Congressional Liaison are now handled out of the

Director's Office, Tours out of the Administrative Division, Correspondence and

Research matters out of the Files and Communications Division, Fugitive Publi-

city out of the Special Investigative Division. At one time the Correspondence

Section was attached to the Associate Director's Office and the Research Section

fi Was attached to the Training Division.

Memorandum to the Director from N. P. Callahan

Re: Proposed Re-Establishment of Crime Records Division

under the old division setup and we were finally able to prevail upon Mr. Gray

to consolidate the 2 into 1 section and assign it to the Files and Communications

Division. This step has assisted to some extent, but the continuity and coordina-

tion as we knew it under the overall division setup is still lacking.

You have indicated a desire to establish an amiable working relation-

ship with the press. I could not agree more; however, to do so, it is firmly

believed that one division should be basically responsible for this function. It

would mean that the Assistant Director of this division would have to re-establish

press contacts as well as the whole gambit of the news media, including radio,

television, feature writers, and the like. Centralizing this responsibility to one

division as was handled in our old Crime Records Division would coincide with

the long-standing Bureau policy that has been so effective; namely, centralization

of responsibilities. For example, as indicated previously, the Press Services

Office and Congressional Liaison Office now work directly under you. This in

effect makes your office operational and adds certain burdens to you which are

unnecessary.

It is true that some people might argue that re-establishing this

• division would be the first step in a Bureau public relations program. I do not

agree with this concept because in effect this action would be promoting our

investigative interestswhich is the very reason for the FBI's existence and prob-

ably never before have we so needed a shot in the arm to promote our investigative

interests.

Also, as a matter of background this current proposal has been

considered very carefully since Mr. Gray's departure and it was the unanimous

feeling of the Executives Conference held as recently as May of 1973, that the

division should be re-established. Mr. Ruckelshaus had orally indicated his

agreement but also felt in view of his anticipated short tenture he should not be

involved in any major Bureau changes.

Enclosed is a proposed organizational chart which shows the organi-

zational breakdown of the suggested division. The breakdown is also a suggested

one; however, as you will note, the Press Services Office and Congressional.

Liaison Office would be placed back into this division. As to a name for this

division, Crime Records is really a misnomer since our crime records are

actually kept and published by our Computer Systems Division. Crime Research

Division does not adequately describe the division and other names which would

in the event you would like to discuss this matter in detail it might be placed

in line for an early discussion at an Executives Conference.

Memorandum Callahan to the Director dated 7/12/73,

captioned as above, forwarded to the Director a proposed reorganization

chart (Memorandum and chart, Tab A). Pursuant to instructions of the

Director, the Office of Planning and Evaluation (OPE) has analyzed the

chart and offers the following observations in support of a revised or-

ganization chart (Tab B).

An analysis of the proposed chart, Tab A, discloses it

was envisioned that the Congressional Services Office and the #1 Man

would be one and the same with a Congressional Liaison Agent and the

Research Section reporting to him. He in turn would report to the

Assistant Director. Press relations and inquiries (Press Services

Office) would be handled directly out of the Assistant Director's Office.

The Correspondence and Publications Section would report to the #2 Man,

who would report to the Assistant Director.

It is the opinion of OPE that the #1 Man cannot effectively

function as the head of the Congressional Services Office and at the same

time afford direction and supervision to the Research Section, and in

addition substitute for the Assistant Director in his absence.

Further,

with the formation of the Congressional Oversight Committee increased

demand will be made on the Congressional Services Office. The

Congressional attention being afforded the Bureau and the importance of

the Bureau's relations with Congress require that the Congressional

Services Office report directly to the Assistant Director. The role of

the Research Section in projecting the Bureau's image is of sufficient

import as to mitigate against undue dilution of the #1 Man's supervision

of that section. Press relations and Congressional relations should be

of highest priority for the Assistant Director of the reconstituted division

and it is for these reasons that OPE recommends that the Congressional

Services Office as presently constituted repor

directly to the Assistant

Director as would the Press Services Offic

Memo R. J. Baker to Mr. Callahan

Re: Proposed Re-establishment of

Crime Records Division

A review of the proposed chart, Tab A, discloses that •

the Correspondence and Publications Section has under it the Publications

Unit and the Research Section has under it the Tour Unit. The Publications

Unit should more properly be assigned to the Research Section as the

work it performs is related functionally to the other work of the Research

Section. The Publications Unit draws heavily upon the resources of the

Research Section in performing its functions, more particularly the

preparation of the Law Enforcement Bulletin and the Investigator.

The Tour Unit could be assigned to either section; however,

for balance of supervision it is suggested the Tour Unit be assigned to the

Correspondence Section as it was before the division was dissolved.

During this analysis, the question of consolidating the

liaison functions of all divisions into one section was considered. It was

determined that the liaison functions of the divisions, other than

Congressional liaison, are operational functions peculiar to those divisions.

For example, liaison operations within the Intelligence Division are

oriented toward the intelligence community, whereas relations with the

Federal Aviation A ministration are more properly tied to the General

Investigative Division, which handles aircraft crimes. This arrangement

is presently in operation and functions efficiently. To alter it purely for

consolidation purposes would be counterproductive.

RECOMMENDATION

That the revised organization chart proposed by OPE,

Tab B, be adopted.

At the Executives Conference, July 25, 1973,

Mr. Kelley designated hessrs.

Marshall, Jenkins; Gebhardt,

Baker, Cleveland, and Miller to form a Committee to recommend

a candidate to be the new Assistant Director of the proposed

new division which will handle responsibilities formerly assigned

to the Crime Records Division.

Mr. Kelley indicated that he

wanted the Committee's recommendations by 8/10/73 in order that

he could make an announcement regarding the new division by

8/15/73. Mr. Kelley also wanted the Committee's recommendations

concerning the name of the proposed division.

Subsequently, Mr. Walsh was added to the Committee with

Director Kelley's concurrence.

on 8/1/73 the Committee met to discuss logical candidates

"to head up the new division.

All of the Committee members present

presented the names of the same three candidates for the position;

that is, SAC Rex I. Shroder, San Diego Office; SAC John J.

McDermott, Washington Field Office; and SAC Robert Russ Franck,

Organized Crime Division-New York Office.

Considerable discussion followed regarding the qualifica-

tions of each man to fill this position and it was agreed that

each could handle the position although because of personality

differences, et cetera, each would approach the responsibilities

in the position from a

different standpoint, that is, each had

his own strengths as compared with the other men.

For example,

it was acknowledged by all Committee members that SAC Franck

would be the strongest candidate from the liaison standpoint but

that the other two SACs were probably stronger from an administra-

tive standpoint.

The consensus of the group was that these three men were

so nearly,

comparable for this position that

with a dime."

However, the Committee rated them in the

following order: (1) SAC Rex I. Shroder, (2) SAC Jobn J.

McDermott, and (3) SAC Robert Russ Franck.

As regards SAC Shroder, Committee members recalled that

he was also a candidate for the position of Assistant Director

of the Computer Systems Division; however, at that time recollec-

tions were that Mc. Shroder preferred for

personal reasons to

withhold his name from consideration due to the fact that be

was in some way involved with the support or care of an aged

mother.

The recollections are not entirely clear on this issue

but it is being mentioned since it may have some bearing on

the Director's action in this appointment.

Due to the fact that the Committee feels that each

candidate mentioned is qualified to handle the responsibilities

of Assistant Director. of the

new division and since this new

position is critically important to the Bureau, the Comnittee

concluded that it would be well for Mr. Kelley to personally

interview each of the candidates prior to making his selection.

In this regard, members of the Committee are available to

discuss in detail what the Committee felt were the special

qualifications of each candidate for the job.

Name of Division

Various names for the new division were discussed

including "public Information and Research Division" and

"Correspondence and Research Division," which had been previously

It was pointed out that there is a prohibition

against the use of the "public Information" concept since this

is already in use by the Department and since each Department

can have only one such service.

It was also felt that the use of the word "Correspondence"

in the title might convey to à critical public that we are

devoting an entire division merely

to handle correspondence

matters although the Committee was sure that there would be

some understanding that this problem represented quite a large

volume of work in the Bureau.. The Committee concluded that a

more appropriate name

for the new division would be "Research

and Services Division" since all functions logically fell under

these descriptive terms.

The Committee, therefore, unanimously

agreed that this would be an appropriate

name.

In my discussion with you, it was pointed out that

"External Affairs Division" seems to do the job fairly well since

it is nonspecific and since on the other hand it explains fairly

precisely what the functions of the new division will be, that is,

handling Bureau affairs external to the Bureau itself including

liaison with Congress, correspondence, and liaison with media

personnel. For this reason I feel that this name

PROPOSED RE-ESTABLISHLIENT OF

CRIME RECORDS DIVISION

At the Executives Conierence,

July 25, 1973,

Mr. Kelley designated Messrs. Marshall, Jenkins, Gebhardt,

Baker, Cleveland, and Miller to form & Committee to recontend

a candidato to be the new Assistant Director of the proposed

new division which will handle responsibilities formerly assigned

to the

.....wanted Crime Records Division.

x. Kelley indicated that ne

-

the Conmittee's recommendations by 8/10/73 in order that

he could make an announcement regarding the new division by

8/15/73.

ir. Kelley also wanted the Committee's recommendations

concerning the name oi the proposed division.

Subsequently, Mr, Walsh was added to the Committee with

¿ Director Kelley's concurrence.

On 8/1/73 the Committee met to discuss logical candidates

to head up the new division.

All of the Committee members present

presented the names of the same three candidates for the position;

chat IS, SAC deX L saroder, san DIego OitICe; sAL JObs o.

savermott, Hashington L1e1d

Office; and SAC Robert Russ franck,

Organized Crime Division-New York Office.

Considerable discussion followed regarding the qualifica-

tions of each man to fill this position and it was agreed that

each could handle the position although because of personality

differences, et cetera, each would approach the responsibilities

in the position from a different standpoint, that is, each had

his own strengths as compared with the other men.

For example,

it was acknowledged by all Committee members that SAC Franck

would be the strongest candidate from the liaison standpoint but

that the other two SAcs were probably stronger from an administra

tive standpoint.

The consensus of the group was that these three men were

so nearly comparable for this position that you could "cover them

with a dime." However, the Committee rated them in the

following order: (1) SAC Rex I. Shroder, (2) SAC John J.

McDermott, and (3) SAC Robert Russ Franck.

As regards SAC Shroder, Committee members recalled that

he was also a candidate for the position of Assistant Director

0f the Computer Systems Division; however, at that time recollec-

tions were that Mr. Shroder preferred for personal reasons to

withhold his name from consideration due to the fact that he

was in some way involved with the support of care of an aged

nother. The recollections are not entirely clear on this issue

but it is being mentioned since it may have some bearing on

the Director's action in this appointment.

Due to the fact that the Committee feels that each

candidate mentioned is qualified to handle the responsibilities

Of Assistant Director of the new division and since this new

position is critically important to the Bureau, the Committee

concluded that it would be well for Mr. Kelley

to personally

interview each of the candidates prior to making his selection.

In this regard, members of the Committee are available to.

discuss in detail what the Committee felt were the special

qualifications of each candidate for the job.

Name of Division

Various names for the new division were discussed

including "public Information and Resezrch Division" and

"Corréspondence and Research Division," which had been previously

suggested.

It was pointed out that there is a prohibition

against the use of the "public Information" concept since this

1s already in use by the Department and since each. Department

can have only one such service.

It was also felt that the use of the word "Correspondence"

• In the title might convey to a critical public that we are

devoting an entire division merely to handle correspondence

matters although the Committee was sure that there would be

some understanding that this problem represented quite a large.

volume of work in the Bureau. The Committee concluded that a

nore appropriate name for the new division would be "Research

and Services Division" since all functions logically fell under

these descriptive terms.

The Committee, therefore, unaninously

agreed that this would be an aypropriate name.

Diractor Sec'y

Persuant to my discussion with you yesterday, my

conversation with Mr. Callahan, and a conference with various

Inspectors and supervisors of the new External Affairs Division;

I suggest the attached organizational chart, depicting the

setup of the Division's Front Office and the two Sections and

units, be approved.

In addition to the discussions mentioned,

my conclusion is based on a review of the material and memoranda

previously prepared and submitted in connection with re-establishing

the old Crime Records Division.

These include the memorandum of

12/14/72 from Mx. Walters to Mr. Felt;

a memorandum of 5/30/73

from Mr.

Marshall to Mr. Felt; the memorandum of 9/5/73 from

Mr. Miller to Mr. Callahan; and your memorandum of 9/6/73 to ME.

Callahan, Mr.

walsh and Mr. Herington.

• In reaching this decision, careful consideration has

been given to the responsibilities of the various sections and

In connection with

the Front Office, one prime objective was to establish sufficient

flexibility. while at the same time maintaining direct control over

all Division responsibilities.

I believe the suggested organiza-

tional chart will accomplish this. William D. Ellingsworth, when

he reports around 10/1/73, will

be attached to Press Services in

the Division Front Office.

As in the past when the old Crime

Records Division was in operation, all requests, telephonic and

written, to meet with the Director will be handled by this Division

if received elsewhere should be referred here.

If this memorandum meets with your approvati my staff

and I

will begin organizing the Division immediately.

the purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that

ASAC James M. Murphy of the Tampa Office be assigned to the external

Affairs Division as my #2 Man.

ASAC Murphy is 47 years old, married with three children

and has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Tufts College, Medford,

Massachusetts. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and

entered on duty as a Special Agent on 1-22-51. He served in the Cincinnati

and Newark Offices, having been designated a relief supervisor in the latter

office, prior to his assignment to FBI Headquarters on 5-15-60. During

his assignment at FBI Headquarters, he served in the former Crime Records

Division where he served as a Unit Chief from 8/66 until 6/70 when he was

transferred to the Inspection Division as a Permanent Inspector's Aide.

On 4-27-71 following his tour of duty on the Inspection Staff, he was reassigned

to the Special Investigative Division where he served as Supervisor in Charge

of the Unlawful Flight Unit in the Fugitive Section. He was designated

- ASAC of the Tampa Office on 1-3-72 and has been assigned to that office

since that date.

434/5:2-916

ASAC Murphy's file is replete with commendations and incentive

awards based on his outstanding abilities and performance. It is noted that

based on the high caliber of his performance as reflected in his last annual

performance rating he was granted an incentive award.' I feel he is uniquely

qualified for the #2 Man position in the External Affairs Division based on

his personality; experience, background and appearance, as well as his

ability. While formerly assigned to FBI Headquarters and during his current

assignment as ASAC in Tampa he has demonstrated an outstanding ability

to meet and impress people in all walks of life, has given numerous speeches

and has always represented the Bureau most favorably. Based on his present

field experience he is capable of bringing a dimension to the operation of my

division in terms of rapport with the field due to his first-hand knowledge of

our needs regarding public relations and the ability to generate and implement

ideas along these lines.

FOR NEWLY APPOINTED

SACS AND ASACS

EXTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION

In 1958, the former Crime Records Division initiated

an Orientation Program in the Division of one-day duration for

all newly appointed SACs and ASACs.

The purpose was to give

the new officials indoctrination and instruction in various

phases of public relations matters handled by the Division.

There was a need

for this program due to the fact that it is

difficult to set out specifics about public relations matters

the handling thereof in instructional manuals, due to the

variety of things that come up and changing policies and proce-

dures. The one-day program covered various functions of the

• former Crime Records Division, including correspondence matters,

speeches, radio and television programs, fugitive publicity,

FBI publications, news release techniques.

The program proved to be most'

REC-36 66=195:1-10÷7

mutually beneficial

to the new Bureau officials and to the Division, and it

continued with genuine interest and enthusiasm until the

dissolution of the Crime Records Division in December, 1972.

During

the one-day program, the new SACs and ASACs visited

anne teresa new salon

supervisors in the Division, discussed partiqular phases

of the operations, and received reference" and research

material concerning the Division's activities. Most frequently,

the one-day program engendered questions which the new officiads.

relayed to us subsequently.

The biggest dividend from the

program was the outstanding liaison which these new Bureat

officials in their Field Offices maintained with the former

Crime Records Division and their increased personal participar

tion in public relations matters.

The personal relation

established by the new SACs and ASACs with the individual

supervisors in the Division was an important factor in projecting

the FBI image favorably to the public.

RESEARGALT

With the establishment of the Exterhal Affairs Division

and with the important objective to restore the FBI to its

rightful position with our citizens, we propose to reinstitute

Mr. Heim to Mi. Franck Memo

RE: ORIENTATION PROGRAM

Attached is a sample schedule, similar to that

previously used, for this instruction program. If approved,

the scheduling

and handling of this Orientation Program will

be coordinated

• with the Administrative Division and the newly

appointed Bureau officials, consistent with their departure

dates and other commitments.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the one-day Orientation Program for newly

appointed SACs and ASACs, "formerly conducted by the Crime

Records Division, be reestablished in the External Affairs

Division.
