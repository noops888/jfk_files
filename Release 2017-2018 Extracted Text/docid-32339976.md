Reference Havana letter January 8, 1959. Since

the

submission of reference letter, the tollowing intormation has

been

developed concerning the activities of American gamblers

. in Havana:

The gambling casinos in Cuba were closed from January 1,

1959, the date of the overthrow of the BATISTA regime, until

February 19, 1959, when certain casinos were permitted to reopen

by government decree.

Contacts with numerous sources affiljated

with American gamblers in Cuba indicated that during the period

gambling casinos were closed very little

overt effort was made on

the part of any of the American interest holders to obtain permission

to reopen.

On January 8, 1959, HAV-3l advised that American casino

operators

intended to have casinosand hotel employees bring pressure

to bear on the Cuban Government to permit the reopening of gambling

casinos.

Subsequently numerous demonstrations were held by employees

of the various gambling casinos petitioning the government to permit-

the reopening of the casinos in order to provide employment for the

hotel and casino workers.

Permission was finally granted on

February 19, 1959, for the following casinos to reopen: Tropicana,

Sans Souci,

Comodoro, Riviera, Hilton, Nacional, Capri and St. Johns.

The Deauville, Sevilla-Biltmore and Plaza casinos were not granted

permission to reopen.

HAV-31 advised on February 21, 1959, that the government

decree allowing certain gambling casinos to reopen had been brought

about by the strong threats made on the part of the hotel employees'

unions

to go on strike unless their demands were heard and the

casinos reopened. Source noted that the Cuban Government began

February 11, 1959,

to confiscate all slot machines in all gambling

casinos in Havana.
