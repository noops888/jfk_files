So LOGINOV.

3: Regarding subject's clalm to have vialted Mextoo Ciry

on or bour 16 May 1966 and to have conticted the Sovlot Embassy

on or abair 18 May 1960, thia office has establlshed the fact that

a contace as devoribed by Súbjeci did not take place ar any time

during the perlod 10 through 30 May 1966.

3. Subject made stremens to the olfect that ho had res

LOGINOV and a second Sovlet at an unknown restaurant at 1800 hours

on on above IS Mays. Ha clatood to bave talked to these two

Sortets for approximately one hour (le, unill about 1900 houre)

atter which they lett the rescaurant, walked to and entered LOGINQY"s

car, drove to an unknows apartment near the Sovlet Limbassy,

parked the car and emered the apartment and then phoned three

cill sirls who arrived ultiln 20 minutes. Followtng the arrival;

of the girls Subject excused himself and lett the apartinent about

1900 or 1930 bours. To our knowledge there la no precedant for

deser thed by Subject.

Subject stated that he belloved that the auomobile

bore the license number "67." Our recorde show that no Sovlet

Embasay offictal or employee drives an automobile with the number

67 or 76. LOCINOV drives an automobile with Mexico Cliy

diploratic license 19 DA.

Subject's statements to the effect that LOGINOV despos ired

the money back when Subject refused u, is nor in kooping with

laformat lon avallable to this olfice indicates that according to

established Mexican banking practices it le nos possible to set up

a checking account without the presence of the owner of the account

who mus alga signature carde los compartson wuh the stgnetres

Subject's general vagueness as to ditor, times,

tho concluston that Sublect has labelcited a large portion of what he

in the car and drive olsowhere for the meeting. I attempted

to change tho time of the meeting as well but. subjeot does

the store at various times of the evening on different days

would have to close the store in order to meet me. He

oloses at 1400 hours on Sundays. I also Instruoted him to

change the speed of the recorder from 1 7/8ths to 3 3/ithe.

We have no recorders in the station that will take a large

reel at 17/8the and this extremely slow spood is not

necessary.

2 During early September Subject commented that there.

Is a new apartment building boing constructed on the corner

of Gelati and Gereral de los Santos, across the

atreet from

the Sovlet Embassy. (This is our new basehouse). I took

considerable notes on this as though I had never heard of the

ISAYEVg first vialt to Subjectis-store.) ISAYEV made a

great many anti-U.S, remarks during his visit to the store

and blamed the U.s. for most of the world's troubles. At one

point ho said that the Sovlots made much better cars than

the U.s. and that Soviet cars were built like "tanks",

subject laughed at this remark because the thought crossed

hls mind that only a soldier vould like to drive a "tank".

and from where Subject was standing-at the time he could.

soo the Sovietis new fleet of American Fords and Chovys.

li. I again asked Subject why the Sovlets bad not been

vlaiting his store in the evenings as they had in the past

and he instated. that it was because most of his "friends"

at the Embassy had returned to the Sovlet Union beginning in

July and their replacements had not warmed up to him yet.

I asked him if a amall fleata

might not help this altuation

and he sald that he thought that it might help. I toldi

him to make plans for a flesta in honor of Mexican

Independenco Day and to inülte an many of the new Sorseta

as possible. He said that he would probably give

the

party on Fridsy, 17 September,. I suggosted that he Invite

Yurly ANDRIANOV (the GRU chauffeur) first and tell ANDRIANOV

to Invite soveral of his friends.

At the

hext meeting with

Subjeat he reported that NIKIFOROV,

LOGINOV and korMUSHRIN

were the only Soviets who came

to

the flesta on the 17th.

They arrived, had a fow drinks, danced to

some. Russian

recorda which they had brought with them and then left.

(Ail are KGB types). They told subject that the other

Sovlets could not attend because they had to attend a Crèch

Embassy reception that same evening. L I can find no record

of such a reception either at the Czech or Polish Embaaales

and there is no indication on the Soviet lines that they

had anything planned for that evening. A soviet from

Cuba arrived

on the 17th but we have no idea how many Sovieta

were at the airport to greet him. I questioned Subject

about the Soviets who. hnd apreared at the fleate and he

gave me a little information about them.

They, "falted his

store several times in the next lew weeks and I showed him

photographs of the men and expanded on his previous information.

He had the following to say about them (he has previously

reported on NIKIFOROV).

LOGINOV: Subject said that he belleves LOGINOV replaced

described him

from the northern part of the Soviet Union, is married and

has children. He claimed to have served in the Red Army.

KORNUSHK IN :

Subject likes KORMUSHKIN who 1s friendly,

well mannered and outgoing. He speaks good Spanish and

told Subject that his wife likes Nexico.: Although RORMUSHKIN

was wearing glassea in the photo show to Subjeot, he

commented that be ofton sees KORNUSHRIN without hia glasses.

He smokes "Record" elgarettes and Subject oalle him

"El jovenesto".

5. Subject said that ISAYEV had dropped by his store

during the weak of 18 october and spent some time making

fun of the fing and Queen who were visiting Mexico at the

timeo ISAYEV felt that the very existance of a kins and

Queen in 1965 was silly. He also claired that the Soviets

had discovered

the Comet that was then in the sky. (The Comet

had actually been discovered by two Japanese and bears

their names.) Re bragged

about the great advances in the

Soviet Union In all fields and told Subject with great pride

that the ruble was worth more than the dollar. He commented:

## Page 66

that the U.S, was a waring nation while the Sovlet Union

sought only poade and that the United States would change

to something dimilar. to the Soviet oystem In the near future.

discussing Stanislav SILNIKOV and hia request that Subject.

7. In addition; Subject said that ANDRIANOV had asked bim

to get Viktor KALININ some aphrodisiao pills.. ANDRIANOV

paid that they were "for Viktor KALININ In Moscow" but

subjeet thinks they are "for Yurly ANDRIANOV In Mexico"

Subject sald he hasn't the slightest 1dea where to buy

such a thing.

8. I told subject to test the recorder by speaking into

the microphones both in the upstairs room as well as in the

main part of

the store and then to play back the tape.

Although RESCIGNO has explained the workings of the recorder

to subjeot several times, he claimed that he did not know

how to do this. I then Instructed him to disconnect the

recorder

and.to.dellver 1t to me at 2100 hours on Friday,

5 November. I sald that I would test the recorder myself.

No asked why RESCIGNO could not come to the store and test

It and I told him that RESCIENQ was away. Me then asked if

RESCIGNO

was a Mexican of an American. He gaid that RESCIGNO

speaks Spanish like a Mexican and lo0ks like a"Merican but

that ho (Subject) 19 sure that he was an American. I told him

ISAYEV asked what his fishing plans wore..

Nick said

that he was so busy with his many probloms at the now plant that

he would not be going fishing during June.

Nick then suggested

that they so on the weekend of l July. :

ISAYEV answered "Not even Anatolly (KARABACH?"

Nick brought up the point that ISAYEV had never invited

ISAYEV, definitely uncomfortable and searching

that he hadn'e invited them because his wife

thought that there was too big a contrast between Nick's home

and theirs."

That Nick was "rich" with lots of beautiful things

that thoy lived very modestly having inherited undistinguished

furniture from his predecessor, etc. Nick pooh-poohed this

stating that friendship is what counts and the circumstances

of one's home ment nothing. ISAYEV ended by saying rather

famely that he would invite Nick to his home.

Nick said that

from ISAYEV's words and discomfiture, it was

obvious that he:

is ashamed to invite anyone to his house.

10.

Finally, Nick said that it was his impression that

ISAYEV had absolutely no immediate plans to return to the USSR

and Nick feols that he will be here until November or

LICOZY -5 reported on

20 September that LICANNY I

Tours. was one of those Invited to attend

the 24-29 Intourist Conference In MoscoW.

This was

confirmed by LIENVOY on the same date.

Since the Station

had had no dontast with Subject aine 6 January 196s. I:

contacted Don Lautz of the Visa Seotion on 27 September.

to see 1f Subject was still coming into the Embassy

regularly on on visa business.

Lautz said that Subject

had for some time now been sending an agent to the

Embassy rather than coming himself. Lautz readily

agreed to give Subjeot a call, however, and reached him

late that afternoon. He told Subject that the "people"

at the Embassy whom he had introduced subject to earller

were interested In talking with him and asked if he could

drop into

the Embassy In the next low days.

subject

immediately recognized which "people" Lautz was referring

to, sald that as a matter of fact he had something to

diecuss with "them," commented that it probably in fact

involved the same matter, and agreed to come to lautz'a

office at 11:00 the next daye. As he had done with Irving

A. Oronsly, Lautz agreed to let me use his office to

talk to Subject.

2.

I went to Lautz's offico at 11:00 on the 28th,

but when Subject had not appeared by 11:15, Lautz agreed

to call me in my office when Subject arrived. Lautz called

about 11:30, and I went right down. By the time I got

there, however, Subject had already explained to Lautz

that he was sure I wanted to talk about his Invitation to

the USSR and had given Lautz a list of three other

Inuttong to the 19gn5r1st conference. Lautz introduced

me by true name as Oronsky's replacement. Sutject, in

What Lautz had forewarned me was his usualf over enthusiastio

marner, greeted no with a "bollevo mo, it is my ploasure"

salutation and, upon

confirming that it was the Intourist

conference I was interest in, took off from there:

Without

the slightest prompting, he rattled off the following:

a) He had recelved a telegram from

Moncow on

6 september inviting him to an Intourlat conference in

Moscow from. 24-29 Detober.

He had immodiately thought

of Informing

the Embassy, but because of the pressure

of business siriply hadn't gotten around to 1t. When

Lautz called him, he know Immediately what we were

intorested 1n.

b). He had prepared a Xerox copy of the telegrain.

for us; which ho gavo to mo.

He has not yet definitely

made up his mind about

attending the conference, but

thinks he probably will go. At the moment, he was still

awalting the detailed lotter on the conference which,

according to the telogran, was to collow. (LICOZY-S has

atready rocolved his lettor.) In reply to my question

as to whether he was sending enough people to the USSR

to make the trip really worthwhtle, he said that he

had sont only five people there so far this year, but

that he thought travel to the Soviet Union

was definitely

going to pick up. He said that LOGINOV, who has beer

to Moscow could consequently bo mado at rolatively little

additional expense.

c) Subject continued that 1f he did go to roscow,

ho would be glad to submit a report on his trip when ho

got back, got (group) pictures, 1f we wanted them, of

his eyes open. However, he said, as he told Oronsky, ho

la not intorested in working for us on a pormanent basle,

uns w1111ne. to help, he erplalned, because he belleved

basically what we did about current world problems and,

aftor all, had lived in the States for many years and

rogarded 1t as his

"second home." He said he liked the.

arrangement of meeting in Lautz!s office because 1t made

clandestine meetings unnecessary and because he had a

perfectly legitimate reason for being there..

d) Subject

stated that he

had already given Lautz

the names of the other travel agents in Mexico whom he

had heard had been invited to Moscow and sald that once

he réceived the Intouriat letter giving the details on

the conference he would begin calling around to see

exactly who was going.

3. Since a) Subject had already volunteered to do

primarily what I Intended to ask him b) had not get

definitely dedided to make the trip, c) Lautz gave no

Indication of preparing to leave us alone, and a) I

clearly could not got any farther with Subject on a

personal level with Lautz present, I brought the meeting

to an end with a request to see Subject again after he

had recelved the Intourist letter, obtained the names of

those of his collearer tno were solns and deolded

4. Subjoct impresses me as a very sharp, shrewd,

cool-headod, but probably basically sincere indivlaual.

No had the situstion rigured perfectly when he arrived

In Lautz's office, had decided precisely what ho would

be willing to do, knew exactly what he was going to say,

and wasted no words in saying 1t.. I plan to try to get

to know him a little better next time, Elve him a defensive

briefing as well as one on what to keep his eyes open

ror, and also explore his attitude toward a possible

recruitrent piton from the Soviets.

(Prior to his trip

to the ussh in May 1963, Subject agreed to accept Soviot

his return, boxerer, he reported that the Soviets mado

no approach to him. I also want to ask him about LOGINOV;

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1. This. is d new, experimental version of the Personality Assessment

Quet several gors. This new ally alrely he is are hus requires

far less essay type reporting than the previous form.

2. For a number of years, our operational psychologists have beer de:

veloping d system -for "indirect.assessment of larget personalities.. The

system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations

of appearance, manner, and stile of behavior. Such observations are:

used as if they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are

weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile..

Working from the

profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic

aptitudes, artitudes, motives and susceptibillies:

The goal of the assess.

ment is to identity feasible means of influencing the target person,

J. Reliability is vastly Increased when two or more observers complete

this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact,

• il is a rare case where contact is sufficient to complete it fully.

You are

encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking.

Mark such

items with a "C." insead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, on

observer with very limited contact can be expected to enter more "G's"

than MX's."

However, he will frequently follow attractive women with his

eyes when he thinks no one is looking: He is also prone to

brush against or touch women "occidentally" whenever he gets

a chance.

He is a self-confident, rother polished persori who is pröper

and convertional, with either men or women. He is olwäys

He is a charming, urbone person and both friendly and

sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way

but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness.

•He is neat, even dapper, and con be quite fastidious:.
