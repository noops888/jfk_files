FROM SAC CHICAGO

ALEX, AKA, ARO DAILY SUMMARY. CG 6443-C ADVISED HE HAD

RECENTLY BEEN IN THE COMPANY OF LESLIE KRUSE, ASSOCIATE OF

ALEX, AND THAT THEY HAD MADE A TRIP IN THE CHICAGO SUBURBAN

AREAS WHERE THEY WERE MAKING A SURVEY FOR ANEW GAMBLING SPOT

SIMILAR TO THE J AND J PICNIC GROVE WHICH HAD RECENTLY BEEN

SHUT DOWN. INFORMANT ADVISED KRUSE IS MOST ANXIOUS TO GET

STARTED AGAIN EVEN IF IT HAS TO BE ON SMALL SCALE AS ALL OF

HIS EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GUS LIEBE, ARE PRESENTLY LAID OFF

AND IF THE DEALERS AND DICE MEN DO NOT BECOME EMPLOYED IN THE

NEAR FUTURE THEY WILL MOVE WEST AND ANY FUTURE GAMBLING OP-

ERATIONS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE PROPER HELP. INFORM-

ANT STATED THAT KRUSE VISITED A SMALL ABANDONED GAS STATION

WHICH WOULD BE BIG ENOUGH TO HANDLE A GOOD SIZE CRAP GAME AND

OTHER SMALL GAMBLING GAMES AND THIS GAS STATION IS LOCATED IN

THE TOWN OF LILLYMOOR IN MO HENRY COUNTY, JUST OFF ROUTE 12

ON LILLY LAKE. INFORMANT STATED KRUSE BELIEVES THIS TO BE ONE

OF THE PRIME PLACES TO OPEN A BIG GAMBLING OPERATION IF THE

UPPER ECHELON OF THE "OUTFIT, " INCLUDING GUS ALEX, DECIDES TO

REINSTITUTE A GAMBLING OPERATION. INFORMANT SAID KRUSE STATED

IT WOULD ONLY TAKE ABOUT $2,000 TO RENOVATE THIS SPOT AND IF

IT IS KNOCKED OFF, THERE WOULD BE NO LARGE INVESTMENT LOSS.

ALEX ARMED AND DANGEROUS WITH SUICIDAL TENDENCIES.
