Basically the thrust of the Report is that the Agency, CI in

particular, did a very thorough and outstanding job

investigating all Mexican and Soviet aspects of the Kennedy

assassination.

According to the Report,

while the Agency in support of the

FBI's investigation went to great lengths to trace

the

activities of Oswald in the

Soviet Union and in Mexico, simi-

lar in-depth research

as it related to the Cubans was not

done.

This is attributed to the compartmentation

of the

Cuban operations as

assassination plans

The Report takes the position that

leadership being knowledgeable of these activities which may

have caused Castro to take retaliatory measures, and possibly

make this information

avallable to the Warren Commission.

Therefore,

the Agency's leadership,

in the Reports view,

held vital

information from the Commission which may have

changed its findings.

Believe the word "technical" should

be removed when referring to CIA collection capability

in Mexico City.

Question arose as to whether identification

of the KGB officer in Mexico City and his relationship
