LA COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

It is noted that considerable information has been

developed in recent months regarding the existence of La Cosa

Nostra and the identities of leaders and members in your division.

A great deal of this information has come from MI 623-C-TE, who

for many years has been personally acquainted with a number of

important Cosa Nostra figures in the Springfield area.

You are to carefully review this and other pertinent

material and advise the Bureau by 11/12/64 of your plans to

maintain a thorough and continuing project to fully develop your

investigation of La Cosa Nostra in the Springfield Division.

has been noted previously, the lack of information on the

prevalence of La Cosa Nostra existence and activity in a given

area cannot be construed to mean that it does not exist in such

a locale, but rather, intany instances, that there are no

available highly placed sources capable of furnishing reliable

data on this phenomenon in the organized underworld, as recent

experience in your division has again illustrated.

In order to fully develop our intelligence picture

of La Cosa Nostra nationally, it is necessary that each office,

covering an area having La Cosa Nostra membership and existende,

completely determine the make-up of such a group locally, and

its relationship to more important "families" and/or the

"Commission."

This matter is to receive immediate attention and you

are to establish logical and continuing investigative procedures

which wil enable you

attain the coverage necessary in this

Bureau-wide investigate?
