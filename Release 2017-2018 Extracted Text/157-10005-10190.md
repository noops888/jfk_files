Wait just a minute. I am sorry.. I could be wrong

there. I said the wrong thing.

If I am going after the Bay of Pigs invasion, if

this did happen,

as far as the date is concerned, after the

Bay of Pigs invasion, Edwardo did quit the operation and go

on some other assignment or what have you. So that means

he-was no longer in the Miami area. So this part I had to

get a new case officer.

MR. OLSEN: Edwardo left Miami before the Bay

of Pigs, didn't he?

MR. STURGIS: He left after -- well, I don't know

I am sorry. Because there is a possibility that he may have

been either in Miami or he may have been in the Headquarters

in Washington. But I can't pin it down because I don't know

exactly where he was at.

case officer?

MR. OLSEN: Did he ever make contacts with this man's

02468

MR. STURGIS: No, sir, because it had to be one of

two people, it either had to be Edwardo, whom I had never met,

or it had to be possibly

after Edwardo left.

MR. OLSEN: Did

I take his place, then?

MR. STURGIS: I believe so, I believe

did take his place as this party's case officer.

MR. OLSEN: And then, you did not actually have any

PROPERTY OF

contact with his case officer?
