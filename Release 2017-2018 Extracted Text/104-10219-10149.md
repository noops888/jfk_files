Illian fartin

"ta Caradian Press orrespondent in ioscow, :11l1an

Buckley, approacied our Fribassy informally in the icilo of

Decerber on behalf of illliar lartin, the excomployec of vs.

who defected to the soviet trich in 1960.

In finding out wether or not he could cone to Cartil ruckley

his parents.

Since, loverer, 'artir's Intorest in coning to Canaca 15 already

in a neuspaperian's banda, we cannot rule out the possibility

that Rockley nich' write about iartin's irterest. Soch a story

would probably lead to the need for an expression of che Canadian

Joverrent's atlitude. In tina reccanencations or the kind of

response that night is made in the event that a question is put

to my sarister, it muld to zost useful to know what jartin's

status in lay 13 so far as the lnited States is corcemed. Il,

for exasple, your foremment could not tiso legal action, the

Casailaz authorities vould to 1: a position ii this satter came

to publie aliontion to say tiat they were not anare os any barrier

I should be most grateful if trough your channels ve could be

provided inforally with an irdication of tartin's status in las

In the Inited States

Fuckley's only otter carment on lartin was that he didn't

really koos what to sake or sartin.

Kartin seered outspoken in

dealing with the shortcordngs af life in the Sovirt Inion. On the

other hand he spoke with a slight stater ard see..i porvous.

Buckley's vies for what it is worth is that Martin 1s not Interested

in getting Into troable with the jussians or doing arything which

they night consider underhanded. I should enphasize that no nesber

of the Canadian Isbassy has had any direct contact with Martin.
