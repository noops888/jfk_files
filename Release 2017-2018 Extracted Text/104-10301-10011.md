The Special Investigations Group of the CI Staff (CI/SIG)

CI/SIG (the Special Investigations Group) did not exist

prior to the establishment of the CI Staff in early 1955, Its

major functions as described in CSI No. 70-1 of March 1955 are

much more modest than the functions ascribed to it in a write-up

by the Staff in early 1973. The 1955 description of functions

is as follows:

"Special Investigation Unit

point."

By 1973 the description of tasks which had been

assigned

to CI/SIG or which they had absorbed during the course of

events over a period of nearly two decades provides a much

broader range of functions and responsibilities.

They are listed

as follows:

The first chief of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) (as

it was called in CSI NO. 70-1) was Birch O'Neal, a former FBI

officer who had transferred to CIA after World War II,* In the

mid-fifties SIG had rather slim picking and appears to have spent

most of its time investigating various aspects of the LCMAYFOWL

complex (the (Boris Morrostcase) as it affected US interests based

on information the Agency acquired from foreign sources. Then in

1962 SIG received its biggest shot in the arm with the defection

of Golitsyn who brought with him several dozen leads to American

citizens including some supposedly in CIA. The handling of these

leads was assigned to SIG by Angleton, including the information

emanating from Golitsyn, which related to foreign countries.

Thus

O'Neal and his assistant, Jean Evans, played a major role in

directing the handling of the Golitsyn leads (or "Serials" as

Angleton invariably called them). The activity continued through-

out the sixties reaching its apex in the period 1964-65 when the

HONETOL investigations (of CIA staff officers) was at its most

Noting that there might have been some immediate reasons for the

CI Staff to take on operational aspects in its efforts to increase

CI activity, nevertheless it concluded these reasons were not

necessarily based on the best operational and organizational pro-

cedures and methods. The normal staff functions, the survey

opined, could be carried out effectively with a much smaller but

highly experienced staff whose impact and counsel would more

favorably be received by the operating elements of the DD/P. The

given to penetrating hostile intelligence organizations and

recommended that:

hand, was certainly not unavare of this part of McCoy's

background, and it is likely that he and Rocca and Miler

interpreted Kalaris's selection of McCoy as evidence that

Kalaris was out to discredit them.

Kalaris, originally having been summoned home to take

It also before long becane evident that there was an

element of a two way street in thie situation. Soviet-East

limited information about. These included such cases as

MORINE (a past FaI source of voluminous GRU operational

compartmentation was a way of life, and management was

remote from the rank and file. Kalaris was appalled to

learn that his chief of support, who had worked in the staff

for four or five years, had never met Angleton; he had only

seen him from a distance. The overall atmosphere seemed to

Kalarie to be conditioned by doublethink and mirrors.

Compartmentation in the Angleton staff had been carried

to such extremes, however, as to become counterproductive.

With Angleton not disposed to be forthcoming with his

successor, and Rocca and Miler taking their lead fron him

land Hood already having left the staff and the Agency some

months earlier), it was difficult for the kalaris team to

find out what the staff had been doing. Like the blind men

and the elephant, the personnel below the top leadership had

never been exposed to more than their own narrow slice of

staff activities, and accordingly even with the best of will

they were limited in what they were able to tell the new

management. The MORINE case (see below) provided a vivid

illustration of this point.

Mccoy, with his soviet Division background, was

particularly struck at the almost total absence of Soviet

expertise in the staff. There was no Russian language

capability and no realistic area knowledge, and what

experience there was in Soviet matters was dated and

limited. This was the case not only in RiA, but in the

Operations Group as well.

--In a more serious vein, files were found on the

assassinations of President John f. Kennedy and his brother

Robert F. Kennedy. These included autopsy pictures of the

remains of Robert Kennedy. Although Nosenko's account of

the KGB'a involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald and his denial

that the KGB had anything to do with the murder of John

Kennedy might reasonably explain an Angleton interest in the

John Kennedy assassination, neither Kalaris nor Blee, with

whom Kalaris consulted on this bizarre finding, had any idea

why Angleton had the pictures. Neither could they think of

any reason why it was appropriate for CI Staff files to

contain them.

They were accordingly destroyed.

-Angleton's dogged pursuit, inspired by Golitsyn and

his theories, of soviet intelligence penetration of CIA had

led to secret investigations, stretching over a period of

many years, of over forty serving CIA officers. Known as

the HONETOL cases, and later sometimes referred to in the

popular literature as the Great Molehunt, this activity had

produced extensive files in the CI Staff.* In addition,

several hundred files were found on American citizens who

were not CIA personnel but on whom Golitsyn analysie had

similarly cast some sort of KGB shadow. Anong the most

noteworthy of these were files on W. Averell Harriman and

Henry Kissinger. Most of these files were composed entirely

of newspaper reports and a few fBI reports.

was not finished with them yet. Ultimately, all the files

never been possible to be certain that this represented all

-A potentially explosive find surfaced in June: a bag

of mail from the wail-intercept--HTLINGUAl--program. It had

been the public exposé of HILINGUAL and the MiCHAOS program,

infiltration of domestic leftist and dissident groups in

search of insidious foreign sponsorship, in a front page

story by Seymour Hersh in The New York Times on 22 December

1974 that had precipitated Colby's decision to force

Angleton's retirement, and led to establishment in 1975 of

the Rockefeller Commission on CIA Activities in the United

States, and the Church (Senate) and Pike (House) conmittees

to investigate CIA and its activities. Both these programs

had been CI Staff responsibilities. CIA was receiving

letters from citizens who believed CIA had intercepted their

mail, a CI Staff representative had just finished briefing

the Senate Select Committee

just what was done with the letters, and Angleton to find

ways to exploit any ill conceived decisions.

After due

deliberation, the staff of the Senate committee was

informed, and on 16 July, not quite two weeks after the

initial memorandum on this subject, the DCI sent the mail to

the Postmaster General under cover of a letter explaining

The Postmaster General in turn sent a copy

of this letter, along with the actual maid and a letter of

his own, to each addressee. The Postmaster General's letter

referred to "apparent interception and acknowledged

retention of this mail by the CIA," and described the matter

as "a

serious violation of your rights" and "abuse of the

to the DCI asking whether CIA had dossiers on them.

In April a folder with some| MORINE material was found

in an RiA safe and delivered to Mccoy, who, believing that

he had stumbled upon an overlooked vein of

counterintelligence gold, brought the matter to Kalaris's

attention. MORINE in fact had not been overlooked by

Angleton, but this was not apparent at the time. The

Paper and Records: Disposal and Reintearation

The paper-and-records problem was high on the agenda of

issues that needed to be addressed. The quantity that the

Angleton vaults and safes contained was almost overwhelming,

and much of this had never been made available outside the

staff. Integration of this unique data into the DO records

system not only made common sense; it was an obvious

prereguisite to the staft rejoining the directorate.

Kalaris had no problem in principle with the concept of

keeping certain information within the staff, as se did with

its STORAGE system, but the Angleton team had gone

overboard. Whether for reasons of bureaucratic style or

fear of penetration of the Agency, information of all kinds

and fron all kinds of sources had been held privately. All

this had first to be reviewed to identify what was

appropriate to retain and what was not, and the appropriate

then made retrievable.

In the wake of the Rockefeller Commission investigation

and the Church and Pike conmittee hearings, the Agency and

the Do were busy writing regulations and providing

guidelines to operating elements on what was and was not

contained evidence of a penetration of CIA, this clearly was

of vital importance. It, on the other hand, they did not,

it was important that this be recognized and the files and

suspicions appropriately dealt with. Fulian fox, a lawyer

by education who joined the staff in late summer 1975, was

assigned to study these files. A procedure was developed

whereby he reviewed each one by one, and prepared a summary

of its contents. This went forvard to Kalaris with, in each

instance, a reconmendation on the cover sheet for

disposition. On file after file these cover sheets ended up

saying the same thing; that the file had been reviewed,

that the conclusion had been reached that there was nothing

of merit in it, and the file should be destoyed. The review

of the file on Richard Kovich, for example, which was eight

pages long, was dated 22 December 1975.* Kalaris,

concurring, sent it to ADDO Blee with a handwritten note

that the naterial in this case would be packaged and held

with instructions that it should be destroyed as soon as the

Senate released CIA from its embargo on descruction, and

that the summary neno and cover sheet would constitute the

only future record. The HONETOL files received steady but

not priority attention. It took somewhat over a yeat for

Fox/to make his way through all of them. Nothing of merit

was

found in any of them.

A special approach was developed to get the MORINE data

into central indices. As a result of the compartmentation

applied to MORINE in the Angleton staff, much of the

existing MORINE infornation was squirreled away and not

immediately appreciated. The rejuvenated exploitation

program produced a flood of [ERTAPPY/ correspondence with

field stations, but this was slow to yield indexable

material. It was not until the end of 1975 that a focused

The Kalaris staff inherited responsibility for a

handful of defectors and certain contract personnel who had

been working for the Angleton stall. This responsibility

was not particularly welcomed, but it had to be dealt with.

This would suggest that Angleton may have lacked the

opportunity that others had had to observe the kinds of

behavior soviet defectors have displayed in sorting out who

the important players are in matters affecting their future,

and figuring out how to deal with them.

--In the eyes of some who knew hin, Angleton viewed

himself nore as chief of an operational entity than of a

staff. Few gave him high marks as an effective staff, as

opposed to operations, officer. His secret travels in

western Europe, not to mention to Israel, to meet with

senior liaison officials with whom he had developed

confidential relationships constituted a form of independent

operational

activity. The proposal, ultimately stillborn,

in 1965 for Angleton to develop special counterintelligence

units in

Vietnam** displayed certain parallels with his

conduct of counterintelligence

abroad as Chief of the Cr

staff in the way in which the local station would be

effectively

and command channel and communications

would run direct to counterintelligence headquarters in

Washington. The proposed special counterintelligence (SCI)

units for Vietnam

were modeled after scI units employed by

X-2, the counterintelligence arm of the wartime OSS--where

Angleton

began his intelligence career. Perhaps those early

experiences shaped in some way Angleton's later preference

for conducting counterintelligence--by himself, without

involvement of the area divisions and stations.

BY 1976 the office of the Executive Officer of the
