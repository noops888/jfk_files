C. IF APPROACH MADE IN SUISSE IT BEST DONE WITHIN

CONSULAR CONTEXT AND BY GENUINE CONSUL IN ORDER: AVOID ANY

APPEARAICE OF SECRECY OR STEALTH IN ÉVENT GIBSON PRESENCE

SUISSE AND CONTACT BY AMERICAN AUTHORITIES SUBSEQUENTLY

PUPLICIZED.

D. INTERVIEW BY CONSUL NOT LIKELY TO BE AS COMPLETE

AS IF HANDLED BY EITHER ODENVY OR KUBARK REP BUT ON BALANCE

FOR REASONS CITED ABOVE BELIEVE APPROACH BY GENUINE CONCULAR

REP PREFERABLE.

E. CONTACT WITH GIBSON COULD BE MADE (1) BY HAVING

CONSUL GO LAUSANNE AND TRY CONTACT GIBSON AT RESIDENCE

(2) HAVE CONSUL PHONE AND ASK GIBSON COME BERN FOR INTERVIEW

(3) HAVE CONSUL PHONE AND ASK IF GIBSON WILL RECEIVE CONSUL

DOX Ties 19330386

FOR INTERVIEW AT LAUSANNE.. TEND FAVOR COURSE (1) BECAUSE

OTHER COURSES WOULD ALERT GIBSON AND GIVE HIM CHANCE REFUSE ANY CONTACT.

F. BELIEVE INTERVIEWER SHOULD NOT TRY ELICIT INFO

FROM GIBSON BUT IMMEDIATELY INDICATE REASON FOR CONTACT IS

TRY CLARIFY ALL BACKGROUND RE PRESIDENT KENNEDY DEATH,

THAT INVESTIGATION IN STATES HAS REVEALED THAT GIBSON FORMER

ASSOCIATE OF OSWALD AND THAT STATE DEPT HAD ASKED INTERVIEWER

DISCUSS OSWALD WITH GIBSON.

G. IF INTERVIEW HELD IN AMCONSUL BERN OFFICE WOULD

COVERTLY RECORD IT.
