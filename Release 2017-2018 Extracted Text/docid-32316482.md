NEW YORK, NEW YORK

ANTI-RACKETEERING

NY T-l and NY T-2 advised that certain of the

new officials of Local 707 are loyal to ANTHONY (TONY

PRO) PROVENZANO.

This will give PROVENZANO added

weight on the New York scene.

JOE

"RED" TRAINA, who is a member of Local 707, is one

of the major shylocks in NYC.

TRAINA operates through

Kaycor Trucking, NYC.

Interview of GEORGE KAYLOW,

President of Kaycor Trucking, failed to reveal any

pertinent information on illegal activities of TRAINA.

TRAINA, Secretary-Treasurer of Kaycor Trucking, inter-

and denied any involvement in 1llegal activities.

Office of Labor, Welfare and Pension Reports, NYC,

presently conducting investigation into 1964 election,

investigation expected to be completed at end of April,

NY: 92-2988-

On February 16, March 25, and April 23, 1965,

efforts were made to contact SALVATORE D'EORIO by

SA SULLIVAN.

Each of these attempted contacts were made at

the Wagon Wheel Diner, 48th Avenue and Van Dam Street,

Long Island. City, New York. This is the location where

D'EORIO has operated a "shape" and from which a prior

contact was made in the past.

D'EORIO was not observed on any of these occasions

although it was apparent that the "shape" is still being

operated from this diner.

NY T-1, contacted on December 30, 1964, advise

that the recent election of new officials for Local 707,

International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) has resulteo

in the placing of men loyal to ANTHONY (TONY PRO) PROVENZANC

in control of this Local. Informant advised that LOUIS

ALIMENA,

the new president, is strictly a

"TONY PRO man"

and in the informant's opinion there will be trouble

ahead as a result of PROVENZANO's influence.

Informant advised that LEO SCHWARTZ, Recording

Secretary, and FRANK CONNOLLY, Secretary-Treasurer,

the only new officers with whom he is acquainted.

NY T-i was again contacted on April 20, 1965,

and he advised that since the death of CONNIE NOONAN

consideration has been given to organizingsthe platform

phony deals, for at least the present.

Informant stated

that CONNOLLY is the only one really qualified to operate

the union, due to his past experience.

It is CONNOLLY's

opportunity to make himself

a big man if he

operates the

union wisely and with "guts" in standing up to any mens

who try to push him.

Informant felt that CONNOLLY started out wrong

being connected in any way with PROVENZANO, but now

that he is in he could wholly disassociate himself from

PROVENZANO and get on his own, which would unite the

union behind him (CONNOLLY).

NY T-2 again contacted on February 18, 1965,

advised that Mrs. (FNU) GANNON is now the clerk at

Local 707, having replaced EDDIE TOMIZEK.

TOMIZEK iS

apparently going to work in the office of Local 807,

IBT, which is in the same building.

Informant further advised that GANNON was

formerly the private secretary of TOM HICKEY (now deceased),

former president of Local 807, IBT. Upon HICKEY's death

GANNON became the secretary to JOHN STRONG, who became

the new president of Local 807 after the death of HICKEY.

Informant further advised that GANNON later went with

Local 707 for several years but left and has been absent

Informant felt

from the labor scene for severl year to Local 707 with

that GANNON will be a valuable asset

her knowledge of union affairs.

Informant stated that there have been a lot of

guys who look like "hoods" at the office of Local 707

since the new officials assumed office.

not have any specific names but was only commenting on

the looks of the individuals.

Informant further stated that things are quiet

in the office of Local 707 and FRANK CONNOLLY, new

Secretary-Treasurer, appears to be playing a lesser role

than previously anticipated.

The new president, LOUIS

ALIMENA appears to be a strong man in the front for all

activities, at least in the first months of his new

position.
