SCHIEBER cautioned NY T-2 not to discuss

this matter with anyone and above all, he should

not talk to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

about this matter.

He told NY I-2 that he would be put

into contact with another man who would instruct him

further. SCHIEBER did not identify this

other man, but said that

and arrange a mecting. & lül other man would contact him

SCHIEBER asked NY T-2 how soon he could get a

passport.

NY T-2

replied that he could probably get

one in a few days.

He then explained to SCHIEBER that

he is a Canadian citizen and could probably get a

Canadian possport without any difficulty. dru

SCHIEBER said that his group now has the

necessary money to proceed with the pian and that

he wants

to set the machinery into motion as quickly

as possible. He said that he has talked to a Hungarian refugee

and that this Hungarian is already in Europe.

He said that

as of this

time they already have three groups in

Europe ready to proceed.

He said that he now intends to

contact someone in the Free Lithuania Committee.

The source recommended that SCHIEBER not talk to anyone

at the Free Lithuania Committee, since none of that

group has the necessary experience to get involved

in such plans.

SCHIEBER thanked the source for this

information and he said that he would not contact

anyone from the

Free Lithuania Committee. * (U

CHIEBER said that his group is anxious t

dious to

get started on the project and he mentioned

Amsterdam as a specific city abroad, in which they would

like to start their operations.

He said that the group is

now well organized and has carefully laid its plans.

said that earlier theyhad not been too well organized.

He pointed out that the disappearance of SHERMAN BILLINGSLEY'S

son-in-law, ALEC RORKE, in Cuba, is an example of the

lack of organization.

He did not state that RORkE was a

part of his group,

however, the source got the

impression that SCHIEBER was

attempting to leave

the impression that RORKE had been a part of his

organization.

(и)

SCHIEBER advised the source that he has been

in the United States for several years.

He said that he is

an Israeli Jew and had been very active in anti-

Communist Youth work in Israel, but because of the Communistic

influence in the Israeli

government, he had been forced

to leave Israel.

He said,. "I am a Jew, but a Jew

who is a Communist is my enemy.

On the other hand

an

Arab who is anti-communist is my friend."

SCHIEBER, in an earlier discussion with

the

source,

had said that he entered the United States

via Mexico.

At this time, SCHIEBER exhibited Photostat

copies of a letter of recommendation from Mr. JOHN

letter was with the International Rescue Committee.

SCHIEBER also exhibited several other Jetters of

recommendation from prominent people, which letters

were used by SCHIEBER in establishing his chapacter-

so that he could enter the United States.

NY I-? stated that he has had several

discussions

with SCHIEBER

at the offices of the ACI, and SCHIEBER

has told him that he has spent his life fighting

Communism.

Although SCHIEBER had once given him

card reflecting that he was connected in some capacity

with the ACI, on January 3, 1964, he gave him a card

reflecting the name

"Havio

'Schieber-General Contractor."

This card bore a residence phone number as RI 9-1674. He told d(U)

WILLIAMS advised the source not to worry.

He said that although he has little money at the

moment, he was to meet two individuals on January 7th

and 8th (1964) to arrange financing and that he would talk

to them and try to raise some more money. KU)

NY T-2 stated that WILLIAMS advised that he

belongs to no organization, that the operation is

entirely a private venture.

WILLIAMS added that several

people lost a great deal of money when CASTRO.took over

Cuba, and that many of these persons are now willing

to finance an operation which will drive CASTRO and the

other Communists out of

their lost properties..

WILLIAMS

stated that he had talked to "the

General of the Cossacks" but that the General's wife

is sick and might die. He said that he really does

not

know what to do about

the General.

He said that this

is ancther example of SCHIEBER talking too much and

trying to push things too fast.

WILLIAMS said that another such example was

ALEXANDER RORKE.

He said that RORKE flew to a

small island off the tip of Yucatan, near the

Honduras coast.

supposed to make a refueling stop

at this

particular place.

Unknown to anyone else,

RORKE picked up & third man named GARCIA.

Although RORKE

was supposed to be flying to Panama, and had filed a flight

plan for this destination, as soon as GARCIA was picked up

and the plane was

airborn,

he radioed that he was changing'

his course and destination

to Honduras.

WILLIAMS said that

he kept telling RORKE that he was handling things all

wrong, but RORKE would not listen to him.

He said that

when RORKE left,

he had a tremendous

amount of money

with

him, and that this money disappeared with RORKE. He said

that

RORKE was travelling with a pilot nained SULLIVAi, who had

flown RORKE many times before. After the plane took off

from Yucatan, it was not seen again.

He said that

since no wreckage has ever been found, he

is convinced that

the plane was forced to land in Cuba. d(V)

ADAMS commented that the source's prior idea

concerning the use of

a ship as a base of operation

in the Cuban waters,

is a very good idea, and that as

a matter of fact, he has learned that some of the anti-

CASTRO Cuban rebels, possibly the Alpha 66 group,

have

a ship operating in the Caribbean.

He said

that

he will try to find out what organization it is.

said that it has been very

successful, and he pointed out

that a few days before

this group had made a strike on

the Isle of Pines.
