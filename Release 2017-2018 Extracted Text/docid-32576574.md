we have suspected that Vic

that COTRONI has had control or played a major röll in

directing all major criminal activities in the Montreal CANADA

area and as a result derived

an enormous financial benefit.

consider could be part of the COTRONI organization are

as follows:-

Franky COTRONI - EPS #648069, born 9-Sept-30, Montreal,

CANADI

He is the brother of Vic and Guiseppe COTRONI

Further to memo from H.Q. Assistant C.I.B. Officer

dated 12 FEB 65, requesting information relevant to the

involvement of the COTRONIS, GALENTE, GRECO, etc., with

• the

BONANNO Iamily at this time, please be informed of the

following.

2.

There exists a definite link between BONANNO and

these other individuals.

Joseph BONANNO Alias "BANANAS" FPS

No. 891104 1s alloged to have entered this country as early

CANAD

-underboss to BONANNO, considered a top U.s, hoodlum at the

time, took over the Montreal Syndicate. He controiled

organized gambling, protection rackets, stock frauds, gam-

bling, among other major crime specialties.

He was known

to have dictated on policies relevant to the Syndicate's

operations.

( A NAD

Up to this time, Frank allas "FRANKIE PY PETRULA

FPS NO. 389562, a well known

n local hoodlum, who had succeeded

"Edge Man" HarryDAVIS, following the latter's slaying in

rado, d'ed Canadian syndicato..

1946, was known as strong arm man for GALENTE's newly formed

He lost his job in 1955 and subsequently

dIsappeared mysteriously in 1956.

PETRULA 1s reported to

have had close associations with Harry SHIP, FPS.No. 47477,

a top. syndicate member and Luigi allas Louis GRECO FPS No.

815813, then considered an enforcer for the syndicate.: By

1956 the vice syndicate controlled all forms of crime.

4°

It is at this juncture that Police opinions are

the

most conflicting and speculative:

"The chain of command

as presented earlier 1s generally accepted.

Following PE-

TRULA's disappearance, one conjecture is that the city was

divided Into two distinct and separate

East End Gang" and

groups, namely

"The West End Gang".

Othorsmaintain that

this division was never made at all in terms of area but

rather in relation to the typo of crime committed.

Irrespective of the motivations, the city was

divided. Replacing PETRULA we find that Harry SHIP had

control of the West End with GRECO as his counterpart in

the East End." The West had the French Canadian and Jewish

elements whilst the East comprised mostly of Italians and a

losser number of French Speaking followars. This sot-up was

Vincent COTRONI

THIS SET-UP WAS in evidence as late as 1961 when Vic COTRONI

FPS No. 183003 was roported as gradually taking over both

East and West.

His brothor, Frank COIRONI FPS No. 648069

with Giuseppe COCOLICCHIO FPS No. 758891 were responsible

for the East End.

Similarly Peter ADAMO FPS No. 354597

and WilLiam COB FPS No. 90104 had control of the West End

Louis GRECO'g decisions, as

an enforcer were relegated to and acted upon by Vio COTRONI,

his chief Lieutonant, until the late 1950. At this timo, an

Internal struggle was boginning to show botween the East and

Wost factions.

The Jewish element fron the west were gra-

dually loosing ground and the COTRONI nob began showing con-

tempt.

Ho was wounded in the legs and obriously it was only inten

ded to scare him into submission rather than an attempt on

his 11re. salomon SCHNAPP FPS No. 963768, an Influential

weat end edgemen had nas ostentament, the ratch

cust comolished by goons.

This we consider,

Was the

blow to the last and west divisions.

6.

Prior to the East-west amalgamation, a second

theory, loss probable than the first, was also advanced.

Sinco Carmine GALENTE was using both

Louis GRECO and Vic

COTRONI as enforcers as early as 1955, a two way split 1n

crimo specialties may have existed..

GRECO could have hand-

lod drugs, gambling, stock frauds, counterfeiting, book-

making and receiving.

Vic COIRONI, through his associates

may have been responsible for prostitution, bonds and secu-

rities, hold-ups and major rackets.

Drugs could have been

an open field.

Bootlegging into one another's specialty

could have beon tolerated within reason with some measure

of control.

7.

Since 1961, VIC COTRONI's influence and prestige

within the syndicate

Is known to have flourished rapidly.

We suspect that he is presently the Commission boss. His

brothers Frank and Michel COIRONI are considered his enfor-

corsa

GRECO, on the contrary, 1s renowing acquaintances

with petty hoodlums.

As a result his activities are becoming

Increasingly susceptiblo to detoction. GRECO 1s also report-

ed finanolally on the decline.

This figures since he now

operates a second rate restaurant in three Rivers, P.Q-

("LE ROI DU SPAGHETTI"):
