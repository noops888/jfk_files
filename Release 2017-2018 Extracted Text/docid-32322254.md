Dear Dr. Peter Frisch:

I am writing to you about a matter that I believe to be important to the FBI and to the

United States people

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S. C.§2107(Supp.

V 1994) (the Act) (copy enclosed) was enacted by the United States Congress and signed into law by

President George Bush on October 26, 1992. The purpose of the Act is to preserve and maintain all

United States governmental documents in one area, the National Archives and Records Administration

(Archives), for access to those individuals interested in the history surrounding the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy. The Act states that, "[a]ll government records concerning the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate disclosure," and

requires all United States government agencies to find all documents related to the assassination and to

review and release the identified documents to the maximum extent possible to the public. The FBI

has been working diligently since 1993 to fulfill our responsibilities under the Act.

The purpose of this letter is: (1) to inform you that the FBI's assassination records contain

information originating with your agency or your original documents, (2) to respectfully request that

your agency review your information for maximum disclosure to the fullest extent possible, and (3) to

explain the provision, for you requet to protect your informain em diese 029205-3752

To achieve maximum disclosure of assassination records, the Act established the JFK

Assassination Records Review Board (the Board). The Board is an independent Federal agency

charged with overseeing the identification and release of records related to the assassination from the

other Federal agencies. The FBI has assured the Board of our continued dedication of cooperating

with them to meet the objectives of the Act. In that spirit, the FBI would appreciate
