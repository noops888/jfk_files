The FBi has never conducted an investigation of the

Mississippi Freesom Democratic Party (MOP), and its files contain

no record concerning it.

The July 21, 1964, edition of "The Washington Post"

contained an article wnich stated

the MEDP was formed in April, 195%.

It claims it represents a potential 400, 000 Megro voters in the State of

l ssissippi, anú its objectives include a campaiga to force the Democratic

National Convention to seat as beiegation in mucnic Cly, Her versey,

in place of the citicial all-white delegation. This rove, if successful,

is supposed to emble the MITD? to become the Democratic Party of

Mississippi. In suuition, a "Freedom Registration" drive is being

• launched in tississippi to sign up legroes who want to vote but have failed

to register because oi "discrimination, fear and a controversial lucracy

test." decoruing to the articie, civil rights leader Martin Luthey ting

will bagin a live-day tour of the state today on behali of linD?, speasing

at mass railies to pro:note this registration arive.

The article icentified aaron lenty as the NIrD? Chairman

and listea victoria duray and the reverend awn sing as Leaners in

the organization.

Re: Request from Ron Kessler

Hanning indicated to Quinn that, in fact, he had participated

in coverage of the aforementioned convention under

• the supervision of

DeLoach who was then Assistant Director of the Crime Records Division

along with Leinbaugh. It was his recollection that then President Lyndon B.

Johnson had requested the FBI to assist the Secret Service in providing

intelligence information concerning dissident groups and individuals who

might represent a physical threat to the President and members of the

White House staff.

Hanning said that the predication of the Bureau's assignment in

Atlantic City was reportedly based on a request from President Johnson to

Director Hoover and all those involved in the assignment were not to discuss

this fact. He stated that DeLoach telephonically advised the Director each

day of the results of their efforts in Atlantic City and it was his understanding

that Mr. Hoover in turn passed this information on to the White House. He

also stated that information was disseminated on the scene to a White House

representative in Atlantic City. He stated he had not personally seen any

written information concerning the above instructions or the results ther?-

from.

Dy

At approximately 11 a.m., 1/23/75, Miss Frances Lurz, a

retired Bureau employee who was C. D. DeLoach's secretary until her

retirement in 1968, called to advise that she is currently a patient in the

George Washington Hospital recovering from a bout with double pneumonia

and that she had been telephonically contacted at 5 p.m. yesterday evening

by Kessler who asked her pointed questions relating to the aforementioned

matter, indicating to her that he had heard that information was telephonically

furnished from Atlantic City to the Crime Records front office, in which she

workea, and that the stenographic personnel in that office transcribed infor-

mation furnished from Atlantic City on the phone "on plain bond paper."

He specifically asked her if she had ever personally delivered material as

• a consequence of this dictation to the White House personally. Kessler

indicated to Miss Lurz that his information was based on testimony furnished

by former Assistant Director Robert E. Wick to the "Watergate Committee."

Miss Lurz advised that she told Kessler that she had been retired for a

number of years, that the period that he was referring to was some 10

years ago and she was unable to recall any specific details concerning

the matters that took place that long ago but that for his information

she had never at any time ever delivered anything to the White House

in connection with Bureau business or otherwise. She advised that

Kessier was polite during the conversation; however, she concluded

the call on the basis that she had no intention of discussing any matters

relating to the FBI with him.

Vice President, Do America A in to, New Yor bery, and a ormer

Assistant Director of the FBI, advised that he was contacted by

Kessler late yesterday and that Kessler made reference to the same

matter and that he was convinced that Kessler was reading from an

official document of some sort. He (Kessler) refused to identify the

document or where or from whom he had obtained it; however, Wick

zecalleù that in day, 1070, bo was interriored by uno Donald Saudero.

who was then Legal Counsel for the House Committee on Internal Security

on the same subject and that he tried to be helpful to Sanders because

of Sanders' official responsibilities but that even on that occasion,

because of the length of time that had passed, he was unable to give

Sanders much in the way of specific details since he (Wick) was not

personally involved in the FBI coverage

of the National Convention

in Atlantic City in 1964, since it was his responsibility to run the front

office in his role as Number One Man of the Division while Mr. DeLoach

was away. Wick advised Kessler that he was displeased to receive

such a call from Kessler, that he considered Kessler's inquiry unwarranted

and unethical and that if Kessler bothered him again, he would consider

discussing Kessler's activities with Ben Bradlee, Executive Editor

. of the "Post."

Re: Request from Ron Kessler

It should be noted that in Jack Anderson's column of 11/12/71, he

mentioned that at the 1964 Convention Mr. Hoover assigned an FBI team,

including Mr. C. D. DeLoach, to Johnson. Anderson stated, "The FBI men

acted as personal, political investigators for luB who wanted to keep track

of every move at the Atlantic City Convention, particularly the activities of

the late Robert Kennedy whom Johnson distrusted."

It should be noted Bureau files do neveal that by teletype dated

8/20/64 to all offices captioned 'Disruption of Democratic National Conventior

Information Concerning (Internal Security)" it was stated that information had

been received indicating subversive groups, racial groups, racial agitators:

hoodlums and the criminal element may attempt to disrupt the Democratic

National Convention at Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/24-29/1964 through

picketing, demonstrating or other activity. The field was asked to send

informants to Atlantic City to cover such activities. The communication stated

that the Bureau was not interested in purely political activity engaged in by

delegates and others officially attending the Convention but was interested in

subversive activity, hate group activity, hoodlum and criminal activity, o

activity directed at disrupting the Convention. Extensive intormant cover ge

was put into effect and at one point 39 informants or potential informants were

scheduled to be in Atlantic City to afford coverage, including communist

youth groups going to the Convention. We also had extensive technical covera-

both in Atlantic City and other parts of the country on key figures having con-

nections with groups planning demonsiations. or other activity at the Convention

Apparatus was established to disseminate. this information on a daily basis to

ate and the tiant die enter, so we as the New versey Stare

As a possible source of the leak of the above intormation,

SA Angelo J./Lano, Washington Field Office, who maintains liaison with the

Special Prosecutor's Office, advised today that he understood DeLoach did

appear before the Watergate Grand Jury some 9 to 10 months ago but was not

questioned concerning matters previous to 1968.

Kessler recontacted my office today st approximately 2:30 p.m.

and stated that in addition to interviewing SA Todi he would also like to inter- *

was assigned to the Atlantic City RA in 1964.

SA Ben D/ Hale is presently

assigned to the Memphis Office. He was an Atlantic City RA in 1964.

It should be noted that two female reporters for the "Post"

subsequent to Kessler's last call today requested if they could learn the

offices of assignment of five FBI Agents, names not identified. When

asked as to the purpose of this request and informed that they were for

Kessier both reporters were advised that the offices of assignment of

Agents are not a matter of public record.

Bureau files reveal that in addition to the above coverage being

afforded the Democratic Convention in 1964, similar coverage was also

afforded both the Republican and Democratic Conventions in 1968 and 1972.

Attached are copies of memoranda setting forth instructions to all offices

for coverage with respect to those Conventions.

UBSERVATIUNS

Based on the foregoing, Kessler obviously has access to some-

one who has intimate knowledge of the Bureau's investigative role during the

1964 Democratic Convention in Atlantic City. From comments made by

former Bureau Agents who have been contacted by Kessler and advised us

accordingly, it appears that the request for our investigation emanated from

President Johnson to Director Hoover and all involved were requested to

keep this information closely held. Mr. Hoover was advised daily of the

results of our activities in Atlantic City by Mr. DeLoach who in turn

advised the White House. Dissemination was also made in Atlantic City to

White House liaison representatives on the scene. Data from our sources

was disseminated to Secret Service, Washington, D. C., and locally in

Atlantic City, as well as the New Jersey State Police and the Atlantic City

Police Department.

Therefore, it is being recommended that we advise

Kessler that as a result of a request from the White House the FBI did

coordinate the development of intelligence information concerning the plans.

of subversive criminal and-hoodlum groups attempting to disrupt the

Democratic National Convention at Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1964.

This information gathered by FBI informants and sources was subsequentl:

furnished to the White House and its liaison representatives in Atlantic City

New Jersey, on a continuing basis. Pertinent data was also furnished the

U. S. Secret Service at Washington, D. C.; and local representatives in

Atlantic City, New Jersey, as well as to the New Jersey State Police and

the Atlantic City Police Department.

Kessler should also be advised that in addition to the coverage

afforded the 1964 Democratic Convention the FBI afforded similar coverage

to both the Democratic and Republican Conventions in subsequent

Presidential election years, 1968 and 1972.

It is felt the FBI should deny the request to interview the

Agents he mentioned. .

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. That Kessler be advised that as a result of a request from th

White House the FBl did coordinate the develepment of intelligence info -

attempting to disrupt the Democratic National Convention at Atlantic City,

New Jersey, in 1964. This information gathered by FBI informants and.

sources was subsequently furnished to the White House and its liaison

representatives in Atlantic City, New Jersey., on a continuing basis.

Pertinent data was also furnished the U. S. Secret Service at Washington,

D. C., and local representatives in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as well as

the New Jersey State Police and the Atlantic City

Police Department.

2. Kessler should also be advised that in addition to the coverag

afforded the 1964 Democratic Convention the FBI afforded similar coverage

to both the Democratic and Republican Conventions in subsequent

Presidential election years, 1968 and 1972.

3. Kessler should be advised that the FBI denies his request to

interview the Agents he mentioned.

The Washington Post on Sunday, 1/26/75, carried a front page story by

staff writer Ronald Kessler (attached) reporting that during the 1964 Democratic

National Convention, President Johnson received reports on key convention

delegates from "wiretaps and bugs" installed by the FBI on civil rights leaders:

and attributed this information to a Senate Watergate Committee memorandum.

The article summarizes a 1973 interview with Leo T. Clark (EOD as a Special

Agent 1/11/43, retired 2/1/65 as Senior Resident Agent, Atlantic City), and

quotes Clark as saying the information was reported to President Johnson based

on an installation in the hotel suite of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and a store

front used by civil rights leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate

Committee that the electronic and physical surveillances at the convention were

carried out by a special FBI team ordered by White House and was under the

personal direction of Cartha D. DeLoach, then an Assistant Director. According

to Clark, the stated purpose of the operation was to gather intelligence on

potential violence or disruption and Clark is reported as stating DeLoach told

him to avoid discussing the operation with the Secret Service.

The news afticle continues Clark stated most of the information obtained

by the FBI was transmitted to President Johnson over a telephone line specialiy

installed to bypass the White House switchboard. According to the news article,

Clark said information furnished included the activities of then Attorney General

Robert F. Kennedy, identities i

'of Senators and Congressmen visiting King's

hotel suite as well as persons seeking support of civil rights leaders, plans of

delegates or delegations and speculation on Vice Presidential nominees.

-=

Kessler's article states the authenticity of the Clark memorandum which

cites room numbers of hotel suites bugged and the source of funds for part of

the operation were verified by persons who either received it or were present

when Clark was interviewed. The article also states the FBI solicited inteiligence

through Agents posing as reporters. According to the article, the memorandum

indicates Clark appeared in response to a subpoena but did not testify under oath. ":

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

Kessler's article indicates he has had access to the 1973 Senate Watergate

interview of DeLoach and spells out DeLoach's denial under oath having had a

direct line to President Johnson or having spoken with the President during the

convention. Kessler also states one surveillance was conducted as part of a

continuing installation on a person believed to be under the influence of the

Communist Party which had been approved by Kennedy.

Kessler's article came as no surprise inasmuch as last week DeLoach

and several other retired and current Bureau employees reported they had been

contacted by Kessler for comments concerning the Bureau's operations at the

Democratic National Convention in 1964.

A review of the file of retired SA Clark contains no information that he

was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Committee at any time or has been in

touch with the Bureau in this regard.

APPARENT LEAK CONCERNING FBI PARTICIPATION AT

1964 CONVENTION

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate Watergate Com-

mittee,. John Dean, on 6/27/73, testified and identified certain documents

which he previously had furnished to the committee. Among those documents

were items referred to during the testimony as the "Sullivan Memoranda" which

were not admitted into evidence by Chairman Sam Ervin. Subsequent contact

with the Deputy Chief Counsel of the committee determined the committee had

no intention of releasing the Sullivan Memoranda or even publishing them with

the committee reports. The counsel stated he would discuss with the chairman

the possibility of making a copy of the Sullivan Memoranda available to the FBI.

On 7/25/73 the counsel advised the Bureau that the chairman had agreed the FBI

should have this information and in turning copies of the documents over to the

FBI stated only he, Rufus Edmisten, and the other staff member who had inter-

viewed Sullivan for the committee had reviewed the memoranda.

The material turned over to the Bureau included four separate items

and two envelopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office

Building marked "Personal"' and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret." The first document, all of which is typed,

is headed re "President Johnson, Politics of the FBI." This one-page document

concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on 11/12/68 for the FBI to

check all outgoing telephone calls made by the then Vice Presidential candidate,

Mr. Spiro Agnew, on the date of 11/2/68 when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New

Mexico. This document states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.m., 11/13/68

to ask about the progress the FBI was making in this matter. (This matter

pertains to the Mrs. Claire Chennault matter.) A second item concerns an

alleged request by Marvin Watson on 2/18/66 for the FBI to cover Senate

Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page indicates

President

Johnson asked the FBI to determine if Republicans were involved in instigating

a riot in New York.

The second document consists of one typewritten page labeled "Top

Secret" and the heading "Preface" and is a general recitation of alleged FBI

involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far exceeded Roosevelt

• in using the FBI for political purposes.

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI," is marked

"Top Secret," and consists of three pages. It cites 10 alleged incidents of mis-

use of the FBI by President Johnson as follows: (1) Re: Mrs. Claire Chennault

and Embassy of South Vietnam, (2) Re: Democratic National Convention Atlantic

City, N. J. 1964, (3) Re: Don Reynolds (a personality in the Bobby Baker case);

(4) Re: Democratic Convention 1968, (5) Re: Walter W. Jenkins, (6) Re: Walter

Jenkins; (7) Re: Mrs. Claire Chennault, Embassy of South Vietnam, (8) Re:

Senator Barry Goldwater, (9) Re: George Reedy, (10) Re: Walter Jenkins.

The fourth documents reads as follows: "John, Please see the enclosure

the contents of which are self-explanatory. If I am to type my observations myseli

please be tolerant of my poor typing. Bill."

The fifth document bears a marking "Secret" re 'Watergate." This is an

offer on the part of Sullivan to testify before the Watergate Committee in behalf

of the Administration and by doing so could put the current (Nixon) administration

in a very favorable light.

When copies of this material were turned over to the FBI, Mr. Edmisten

stated that Seymor Hersh, a newsman, had somehow obtained some or all of

ithe intormation contained in the Sullivan Memoranda. According to Edmisten,

faersh had indicated he had no intention of using much of this material although

some of it had been published regarding the checking of Agnew's telephone calls.

On 8/13/73 DeLoach called the Bureau stating he had been interviewed

by three newsmen representing Scripts-Howard, the Chicago Tribune, and the

Hearst Publications, who claimed they knew that Sillivan had given John Dean

a memorandum alleging FBI political assistance to the Johnson Administration

and the memorandum had been turned over to the Ervin Committee. While the

reporters claimed they had not seen copies of the memorandum, DeLoach felt

they knew the contents of the memorandum based on the questions they asked.

Subsequently, DeLoach advised the Bureau that he had received a

subpoena to appear before the Senate Watergate Committee on 10/3/73 and this

subpoena was discussed with the Department with the recommendation that an

appropriate attorney be designated to appear with Mr. DeLoach to represent

the interests of the United States.

By letter to the Director dated 12/7/73, DeLoach advised that he furnished

three hours of testimony to Senator Howard Basker and minority counsel, former

SA Donald Sanders and a stenotypist who was present. He advised the testimony

was under oath and in executive session and the questioning was largely based

on the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Dean. DeLoach reported that

Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the advice and

instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he attempted to

answer every question with blunt honesty and Department Regulation 1622 was

utilized only once pertaining to the usage of an electronic surveillance

as au-

thorized by former Attorney General Kennedy.

DeLoach was subsequently interviewed by the Watergate Special Prosecution

Force in about January, 1974. However, according to SA Angelo Lano of

Washington Field Office, DeLoach's testimony in this regard pertained to the 17

wiretaps and did not go into the 1964 coverage of the Democratic Convention.

REVIEW OF BUREAU FILES AND CURRENT INQUIRY CONCERNING

THIS MATTER

Bureau files show that on 8/20/64 a teletype was directed to all continental

offices captioned, "Disruption of Democratic National Convention, Information

Concerning (Internal Security).' This teletype advises information has been received*

which indicates subversive groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and

the criminal element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and

the Bureau must be advised of all such subversive criminal, hoodlum and racial

elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period. Other general

instructions were set forth concerning informant availability. A follow-up instruc-

tion was sent out 8/21/64 that any information of extreme importance or urgency

should be submitted immediately by teletype or telephone to the Bureau. This

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

file, 100-442527, consisting of three sections, sets forth numerous communi-

cations from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting forth

pertinent developments. The only information located in Bureau files concerning

the special squad in Atlantic City was an eight-page memorandum (copy attached)

with enclosure located in the file of DeLoach. This is a memorandum from

DeLoach to Mohr dated 8/29/64 which sets forth that in connection with the

assignment of the special squad in Atlantic City at the direction of the President,

DeLoach wished to report the successful completion of this assignment. He

states that by means of informant coverage, use of various confidential tech-

niques, infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were able to

keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments. DeLoach also

advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic City with Secret

Service as well as state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther

King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar coverage established on the lead-

quarters of the Congress of Ricial Equality (CORE) - Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC). DeLoach states he was able to advise the

White House in advance of all plans made by these two sources and coverage

was highly effective. DeLoach advises "with Bureau approval"' he instituted

coverage on CORE - SNCC headquarters at their meeting hall and our Negro

undercover agents penetrated the headquarters of the Mississippi Freedom

- Democratic Party (two separate factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi

delegation and was a highlight of the convention) and through cooperation with the

management of NBC news our Agents were furnished NBC press credentials.

De Loach reported that 44 pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter

Jenkins at the White House and to his memorandum he attached a copy of these

daily summaries dated 8/24, 25, 26, 27/64. These summaries are in effect

a running log of developments which took place at the convention. DeLoach also

states he arranged for a lease line between the control post at Atlantic City and

the Bureau. He concludes the memorandum by making recommendations that

personnel involved, namely 27 Agents, one radio maintenance technician and

two stenographers of the Newark Office be commended. Mr. Hoover noted

DeLoach Should receive a meritorious award.

thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one of the finest the

President had ever seen.

According to this memorandum, Jenkins told Mr.

Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and because of the work

some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly where they were and what

they were doing and consequently they were not able to be very effective. It

should be noted that this particular memorandum of Mr. Hoover's, dated

30/10/64, is referred to in Sullivan's documents sent to John Deanj

A thorough review of Bureau records, including a review of abstracts

of Mr. Hoover, Mr. Tolson, Mr. ivohr, as well as Vir. DeLoach, failed is

locate any memorandum or other document pertaining to a request having been

received from President Johnson or anyone at the White House instructing

that the FBl afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House and had

a direct line at his residence to the President so it weil may be that this request

was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it orally with Mr. Hoover

for Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the request was never put in

writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY

On 1/26/75 the Inspection Division directed a teletype incorporating

12 questions to the 19 Agents and one radio maintenance technician who are

still on active duty and were with DeLoach at Atlantic City. These questions

were designed to have the participating personnel furnish us with their recol-

lection as to their duties and involvement at Atlantic City. Detailed responses

were promptly received and all personnel acknowledged their participation on

the special squad under DeLoach's leadership at the convention. All responded

there was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

City to fulfill the FBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not feel that

the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically, the instruc-

tions to the Agents were to develop advance information regarding any acts or

intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances that could arise during

the convention as well as secondary protection for the President. Two of the

Agents, both black, were there in undercover assignment roles. Certain

Agents had responsibility for liaison with Secret Service, others were handling

the large number of informants that we moved into Atlantic City and other

Agents were utilized in operating the technical surveillance on King as well

as the microphone installation installed at CORE - SNCC headquarters in

Atlantic City. All knew De Loach was in charge and he had with him in Atlantic

City three Agents from his office and they were aware that DeLoach was

frequently calling the Bureau reporting developments. Two Agents recalled

DeLoach having a telephone conversation with Walter Jenkins who it is believed

was in Washington, D. C.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files contain a

memorandum to the Attorney General dated 10/7/63 captioned 'Martin Luther

a technical surveillance on King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or

at any future address to which he may move. This memorandum was approved

by Attorney General Kennedy, 10/10/63. A memorandum F. J. Baumgardner

¡to W. C. Sullivan, 7/7/64, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question,

Communist Influence and Racial Matters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the facilities

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Atlanta. The memo-

randum observed that the Attorney General has already authorized technical

coverage of the SCLC and King and additional authority is not necessary since

this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by additional

telephone service within the SCLC.

Memorandum J. A. Sizoo to W. C. Sullivan, 8/24/64, captioned "Martin

Luther King" sets forth Sizoo received a call from SAC Bachman at Newark on

8/21/64 concerning technical coverage on King in Atlantic City. Bachman had

previously received instructions from Sullivan that he explore the possibility

of putting technical and microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising

that a technical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available

lat the hotel concerning a microphone installation. The memorandum pointed

out Bachman was given the go-ahead with the microphone installation as well as

the telephone installation. Sizoo reiterates the Bureau has authority from the

Attorney General to cover any residences which King may use with a technical

installation.

Memorandum to Mr. Callahan

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary CORE - SNCC

| headquarters in a store on Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of Bureau records

fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization for same. A search of

microphone authorizations in the Newark Office likewise fails to locate any

authorization for this particular installation. At the time of the convention in

11964, our authority for microphone surveillance was maintained at the Seat of

Government and authorization for utilizing microphone surveillances was made

by the Director who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell

dated 5/20/54, which recognized FBI authority to institute such surveillances.

By memorandum dated 9/27/65 Attorney General Katzenbach agreed to continue

the use of microphone surveillances only following his personal authorization.

It is pointed out that DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic

City mention's such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of SNCC was based on information that an

apparent member of the Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable

activity, much in a leadership capacity in SNCC. Confidential informants

reported that SNCC, among the various civil rights organizations, was a

principal target for Communist Party infiltration. At this same period of time

our investigation of CORE was limited to determining whether in fact there was

communist infiltration in that organization. (While a question arises as to the

justification of using a microphone surveillance against CORE per se, it is

noted that we did in fact have a pending investigation on SNCC and the fact SNCC

was engaged in a joint temporary office with CORE during the convention may

well have been justification for installing the microphone surveillance. A review

of available material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated 8/22 /64 concerning the

technical surveillance which verifies that the work on two phones in King's rooms

at the hotel had been completed; however, the personnel at Atlantic City could

not place the mike on King in view of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark

files also attribute to SRA Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike should be

considered for temporary CORE headquarters at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic

City. The only other information contained in Newark files concerning these

installations is in Newark file 100-47520, Sub I, which contains a handwritten log

consisting of approximately 50 pages of overhears on King's telephones.

for August, 1964, shows $100 was paid to one Eugene Hornberger, owner of a

bakery shop at 2416 Atlantic Avenue for dismissing his bakery personnel during

the early morning hours of 8/23-24/64 to allow FBI Agents access to his shop.

His bakery was located adjacent to CORE headquarters located at 2414 Atlantic

Avenue and this payment was authorized by DeLoach on 8/25/64. A second

blue slip item was paid on 8/14/64 to the New Jersey Telephone Company in

the amount of $28.82 for a lease line and this expenditure was authorized by

DeLoach.

SA Supervisor Conrad Thompson, currently assigned to the Intelligence

Division, advised that in 1964 he was a supervisor in the Newark Office. Con-

cerning the convention at Atlantic City, he recalls SAC Bachman advising he had

received instructions that De Loach while in Atlantic City would handle all com-

munications

with the Bureau directly from Atlantic City rather than relaying

information to the Newark Office. Thompson recalls that Bachman was un-

happy at being cut out by DeLoach because Bachman was being queried by

W. C. Sullivan as to what was going on in Atlantic City and, of course, he could

Inot furnish such information to Sullivan when DeLoach was dealing directly with

the Bureau.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER BY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well as

De Loach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad at the

convention, some of the Agents tilized media identification of the National

Broadcasting Company. At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the

use of such investigative technique. SAC Letter 68-38, dated 7/2/68, item

B, entitled "Investigative Covers," sets forth that all Agent personnel are

prohibited to pose as newsmen

or representatives of any Wire service for

the purpose of establishing an investigative cover. This rule was invoked

after a news item appeared in the Washington Post on 6/18/68 alleging that

one of our Agents had posed as a representative of the International News

Service while covering an anti-draft demonstration at the Supreme Court on

6/17/68. The allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct

statement as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the

- demonstration.

On 8/21/64, responding to a request dated 8/19/64 from Mr. John®

Doar of the Civil Rights Division of the Department, memoranda were sente

It should be noted that three civil rights workers who traveled to .

Mississippi were discovered missing on 6/22/64 and their automobile found

civil rights workers in Mississippi. Furthermore, information was received

that the parents of one of these individuals would appear at a rally during the

DNC.

On 8/25/64 Assistant Director Cartha DeLoach telephoned a memorandum

to Mr. Mohr from Atlantic City to the effect information from Walter Jenkins

and informants indicated the question of seating the MFDP delegates was expected

to reach the floor of the DNC the evening of 8/25/64. He said "The crucial point

of the convention in so far as possible violence is concerned will occur between

4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. this afternoon. If the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party is not seated then the unruly elements within the Negro group will possibly

attempt to demonstrate." DeLoach indicated that every effort was being extended

to cover developments pertinent to this possible violent situation.

There follows under appropriate caption in summary form information

relative to our coverage at the DNC.

COVERAGE RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL CIVIL UNREST,

DEMONSTRATIONS AND POSSIBLE VIOLENCE

• A review of the summaries furnished to Walter Jenkins by Mr. DeLoach

during the DNC indicates over 25 separate entries dealing with demonstrations

-insofar as their times, places, groups involved, number of participants, and

general nature thereof were concerned. A great majority of the Bureau person-

nel still on active duty who were assigned to this special squad in Atlantic City

have indicated that the attaining of intelligence information relative to possible

violent civil disorders was the primary purpose of their efforts during the DNC.

Our coverage in this regard was handled through extensive informant

coverage at Atlantic City and as a result of information received from informants

in other parts of the country as well. Additionally, we utilized Agents in various

undercover capacities to develop such information. Furthermore, a great deal

of information in this regard was, in fact, received as a result of the technical

coverage utilized. Where appropriate, the information obtained was disseminaied

to the U. S. Secret Service and other interested law enforcement agencies as

well.

ACTIVITIES RELATIVE TO THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT

assignment in part was related to the augmenting of the U. S. Secret Service in- •

sofar as the protection of the President was concerned. One Agent indicated

that Bureau personnel did, in fact, actively assist in the protection of the

President and his family while they were at the DNC.

A review of Bureau file 100-442527 captioned "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)" did not reveal

any information directly relating to the protection of the President.

A review of the De Loach summaries to Mr. Jenkins indicated one

instance where a demonstration was planned to take place upon the President's

arrival at convention hall and another incident which revealed a breach of

• security which allowed an individual to enter the convention hall and proceed

directly to the podium area. This information was furnished immediately to

the U. S. Secret Service.

Information is contained in the interviews of the former special squad

personnel that FBI Agents were utilized in supplementing U. S. Secret Service

personnel on the convention hall floor.

INFORMATION DEVELOPED OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE

A further review of the DeLoach summaries revealed approximately

20 separate items which do not appear to relate directly with possible civil

unrest - demonstrations or with the protection of the President. These items

were developed as a result of the various types of coverage we had at the DNC

but a great number thereof were obtained through our technical coverage. A

sampling of these items includes the following:

---

."..

2. Informant information received that Congressman Adam Clayton

Powell was carrying a revolver.

3. Informant information relative to National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People planning a meeting at a church.

4. Informant relative to King's speaking before various state delegations.

5. Information that the Congress of Racial Equality headquarters in

Atlantic City was attempting to have Congressman Charles Diggs' office in

Detroit, Michigan, picketed, claiming he was "shakey."

Allegations in the press that the coverage of the FBI was used to

follow the activities of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy were not substantiated

in any way by file reviews.

A review of the statements furnished by the special squad personnel

includes various instances where they relate a portion of their overall purpose

was to insure that there was nothing which would "embarrass the President."

One Agent indicated that DeLoach placed emphasis on the fact that the

President did not wish to be embarrassed in any way and that information was

to be gathered which would assure that there would be no such embarrassment.

• Two statements were furnished by Bill D. Williams, present SAC in

Kansas Cty in this regard. One states "I would like to state that at no time did

I ever consider the above to be a political operation but it was obvious that

DeLoach wanted to impress Jenkins and Moyers with the Búreau's ability to

develop information which would be of interest to them" Furthermore. in

response to a question as to whether the Bureau's services were being utilized

for political reasons, Williams answered, "No. I do recall, however, that

on one occasion I was present when DeLoach held a lengthy lelephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins. Theyappeared to be discussing the President's 'image.'

harm. "

Other Agent personnel on the special squad indicated in the negative

insofar as the above question is concerned.

DISSEMINATION

In addition to the summary memoranda furnished by DeLoach to

Mr. Jenkins, information is contained in Bureau file 100-442527, cited above,

that some of the same information was included in daily letters to the White

House and the Attorney General on current Racial Developments. There was

similar dissemination made to U. S. Secret Service, military intelligence

agencies and local authorities on à selected basis.

For information. It should be noted the information contained

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE "SULLIVAN MEMORANDA"

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate

Watergate Committee, John Dean, on June 27, 1973, testified and identi-

fied certain documents which he previcusly bad furnished to the Committee.*

Among those documents were items referred to during the testimony

as the "Sullivan memoranda," apparently authored by William C. Sullivan,

former Assistant to the Directos, who retred on October 21, 1971.

These typed documents consisied di five separate liams and two enve-

lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Erecutive Office Building

marked "Personal" and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only' and "Secret." The first document is headed

"President Jchnson, Polities of the FBI." This one-page document

concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on Noyember 12,

1968; for the FBI to check all outgoing telephone calls made by the then

Vice Presidential cancidate, iir. Spiro Agnew, on the date of November 2,

1988, when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This document

states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.m., November 13, 1953, to

as's about the progress the FBI was making in this matter. • (This matter

pertains to the Mrs. Claire Chennault matter.) A second item concerns

an alleged request by Viaryin Watson on February 18, 1968, for the FBI

to cover Senate Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page

indicates President Johnson asked the FBI to determine il Republicans

werg involved in instigating a riot in New York

The second document consists of one typewritten pago labeled

"Top Secret" and the heading "Preface" and is a general recitation c

alleged FBI involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far

exceeded Hoosevelt in using the FBI for political purposes.

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI,"

is marsed "Top Secrat," and consists of three pages. It cites ten alleged

incidents of misuss of the FBI by Presidant Johnson as follows: (1) Re:

Mrs. Claire Chennault and Embassy of South Vietnam; (2) Re: Democratic

The flith document bears a marking "Secret" re "Watérgata."

This is an offer on the part of Sullivan to testify before the Watergate

Committee in behalf of the Administration and by doing so could put the

current (Nixon) Administration in a very favorable light.

In my letter dated October 2, 1973, to then Deputy Attorney

REVIEW OF FBI FILES AND RESULTS OF INQUIRY

CONCERNAG THS MATTER

Bureau filea show that on August 20, 1964, a teletype was

directed to all continental offices captioned, "Disruption of Democratie

National Convendon, Informatica Concering (internal Security): " This

teletype advises iniormation has been recsived which indicates subversive

groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and the criminal

element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantie Clty and the

Bureau must be advised of all such subversive, criminal, hoodlum, and

racial elements who pian to be in Atlantic Cily during this period. All

activity engaged in by delegates and others citielally attending the conventica.

Other general instructions were set forth concarning informant arailability.

follow-up instruction was sent out August 21, 1954, that any information

Of extreme importance of urgency should be submitted immediately by

teletype or telephone to the Bureau. Our files set forth numerous com-

munications from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting

forth pertinent developments. In a memorandum dated August 29, 1954,

MI. Deloach set forth a resume of his assignment with a special squad

of FBI personnel at the Democratic Natical Convention: DeLoach

reported the successiul completion of this assignment. He statas that

by no ans of informant coverage, use of various contidential techniques,

inilltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

unlization of Agents using appropriate cover as raporters, we were

able to beep the White House fully apprised of all major davelopments.

DeLoach also advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic

City with Secret Service as well as staie and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of

Martin Luther King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar coverage

established on the beadquarters of the Congress of Racial Equallty -

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Deloach states he was

able to advise the White House in advanco of all plans made by these

Equality - Student Noaviolent Ccordinating Committee headquarters at

their meeting ball and our Negro undercover agents penetrated the head-

quarters of the Mississippi Freedom Democratle Party (two separate

factions were contesdag seats for the Mississippi delegation and was a

highlight of the convention) and through cooperatic of news media our

Agents were furnished press credentials. DeLoach reported that forty-

four pages c intelligence date was disseminated to Walter Jen Sins at the

White House and to his mem randum he attached a copy of these daily

summaries dated August 24, 25, 26, and 21, 1904. These summaries are

in effect a running log of developments which took place at the conventica.

De Loach also states he arranged for & lease line (teiephone) between the

control post at Atlantie City and the Bureau. He concludes the memorandun

by maliag recommendations that personnel involved, namely twenty-seven

Jenkins told Mr. Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and

because of the voris some of the Bureau people did they know exactly

whare they were and what they here doing and consequently they were

not able to be very efiective.

It should be noted that this particular

memoranium of Mi. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan's documents

sent to John Deal.

À thorsugh review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo-

randuos or other documents pertaining to a request having been received

from President Johnso or anyone at the White House instructing thai the

FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time Deloach was responsible for liaison with the White House

and had a direct line at his residaxe to the Eresident so it well may be

that this request was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it

orally with Vir. Hoover or tir. Tolson but for one reason or another the

request was never put in writing.

STATEMENTS DE SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL

STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician

sho were involved in the special squad assigament and remain on active

duty with the FBI have contirmed their participation on the squzd under

Deloach's leadership at the convention. These employees advised there

was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

City to fulfill the rBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not

feel thai the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically,

the instractions to the Agents were to develop advance information regard-

ing any acis or intended acis of violence pertaining to civil disturbances

that could arise during the coavention as well as secondary protection for

the President.

Iwo of the Agents, both black, wers there in undercover

assigament roles. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaisen with

Installed at the Congress oi Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinzting -

and be had with him in Atlantic City three Agents from his otice and they

were awarg that DeLeach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting

ton with Walter Jenkins who it is believed was in Washington, D. C., at

AUTEORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE

AI CONVINTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files

contain a memorandum to the Attorney General dated Octcher 7, 1533,

captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr., Security Matter - Communist;

Communist lufluencs in Racial Watters," wherein the Bureau recom-

mended that authority be granted to place a techaical surveillance on

King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) ur at any future address

to which he may move. Tais memorandum was approved by Attorney

General Kennedy, October 10, 1933. A memorandum dated July 7,

1984, captioned "Communist Farty, USA, Negro Question, Communist

miluence and Fzcial Maiters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to Install three additional technical surveillances ou the

facilities di the Southern Christian Leadèrship Conference in Atlanta.

The memorandum observed that the Aitorey General had.already

authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since .

this is merely an exiousin e iuright eurozago tought abor by addi-

tional telephone service within the Southem Christian Leadership

Conference ..

Another memorandum prepared by an official of the then

Domestic Intelligence Division dated August 24, 1964, and captioned

"Martin Luther King" reports a telephone call from SAC Bachman at

Newark on August 21, 1981, concerning technical coverage on King in

Atlantic City. Bachman had previously receired. instructions irsm a

Division oificial that he explore the possibility of patting technical and

microphone coverage on ling and Bachman was advising thai a tech

nical installation could be done and raliable contacts were available at

the hotel concering a microphone installation. The memorandum

pointed out Bachman was given the go-ahead with the microphone

installation as well as the telephone installation. This memorandum

reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Attorney General to cover

any residences which ling may use with a technical installation.

Concerning the microphone installatiom at the temporary

Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

headquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avanue, a thorough review oi

likewise fails to locate any authorization for this particular installatica.

At the time oi the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone

surveillance was maintained at the Seat a Government and authoriza-

tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Direcior

who relied cn a memoranium irom Attorney General Brownell dated

May 20, 1954, Which recognized FBI authority to institute such sur-

veillancas. By memorandum cated septembar 27, 1935, Attorney-

General Katzenbach agreed to continue the use of microphone sumeil-

lances only foliowing his personal authorization. it is pointod out that

DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage a Atlantic City

mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our Investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committe was based on informatien that an apparent member oi the

Comunist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable activity, much

in & leadersbip capacity in the Stadent Ncaviolent Coordiasting Committee.

Confidential informants reported thai the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee, among the various civil rights organizalions, was a principal

target for Communist Party infiltration. At this same perica of time our

investigation di the Congrass of Racial Equality vas Umited to deter-

mining whether in fact there was communist infütration in that orgaales-

tion. (While a question arises as to the justification o using a microchose

survelllance against the Congress of Racial Equality per se, it is noted

that we did in fact have a pending investigation on the Bident Nonviolent

Coordinating Committes and the fact the Stident Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of

Racial Equality during the convention may well have been justification

for installing the microphone surveillance. A review of availabla

material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newarks files contain & memorandum dated August 22, 1964,

concerning the technical surveillance which verifies that the work on

two phones in King"s rooms at the hotel had been completed; however,

the perscanel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on King in view

of the iact they had to leave the room: Newark files also aitribuia to

then Senior Resident Agent Clar' that on Bureau instructions a mike

should be considered for the lemporary Congress of Racial Equality

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER SY AGINTS

As set forth abore, both in the Washington Post article as well

28 DeLoach's memorandum, reporting the actirities of the special squad

At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the use of such inves-

tigative technique. On July 2, 1968, Instructiens were set forth that all

Agant persoonel ara prohibited to pose as nersmen or representatives

di ang wire service ior the purpose o escablishing an lovestigative

posed as a representative of the Internatioal News Service while covering

SKETCHY, AND I TOLD THIS TO MP. EPSTEIN. AS I RECALLED THE

BROAD OVERALL SITUATION, I TOLD HIM THAT I WORKED WITH JOHN J..

CONNOLLY, JR., ON OUR PARTICULAR ASSIGNMENT, AND WE PROBABLY

RECEIVED OUR INSTRUCTIONS FROM SAC BACHMAN THROUGH OUR SUPER-

VISOP. WILLIAM GAGNON. I HAD TO ASSUME THAI MR. BACHMAN

RECEIVED THESE INSTRUCTIONS FROM SOMEBODY AT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS.

OUR PURPOSE IN GOING TO ATLANTIC CITY WAS TO OBTAIN

WHATEVER INFORMATION WE COULD ABOUT PLANNED DISRUPTIVE TACTICS

OR DEMONSTRATIONS THAI WOULD THREATEN THE SAFETY OF PRESIDENT

JOHNSON OR THE SECURITY OF THE CONVENTION.

SINCE I WAS THE SOUND MAN FOR THE NEWARK OFFICE, MY

EFFORTS, IN THIS REGARD WERE CONCENTRATED ON A TECHNICAL.

SURVEILLANCE AS OPPOSED TO ANY PHYSICAL SURVEILLANCE OR OTHER

INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY OTHER AGENTS FROM THE

NEWARK OFFICE IN ATLANTIC CITY AT THAT TIME.

• MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS SELECTED AS THE TARGET OF OUR

SURVEILLANCE. BY WHOM, I DO NOI RECALL. HE WAS THE LEADER OF

THE GROUP OPPOSING PRESIDENT JOHNSON, SO I SUPPOSE ME WAS A

LIKELY TARGET.

MR. EPSTEIN WAS INTERESTED IN MY OPINION AS TO THE

LEGITAMACY OF OUR INVESTIGATION AS A SECURITY MEASURE. I WAS

UNABLE TO IMPUGN ANY OTHER MOTIVES TO THIS INVESTIGATION OTHER

THAN AS SET OUT ABOVE•

I DO NOT RECALL DETAILS OF OUR HANDLING OF THE INFORMA-

TION RECEIVED OVER THE TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE. SA BILLIE D.

WILLIAMS WAS LIAISON WITH CARTHA DE LOACH AND ARRANGED OP

HANDLED ANY CONTACTS REGARDING THE INMORMATIUN UN INSTRUUTIONS

WE RECEIVED• AGAIN, I WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY CONTACIS OR

ASSOCIATES OF KING WITHOUT REFERENCE TO WHATEVER NOTES WE MAY

HAVE KEPT ON THE SURVEILLANCE. IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC

QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HUBERT H. HUMPHREY AND ROBERT

KENNEDY WERE IN TOUCH WITH OR VISITED KING IN HIS SUITE, I HAD

TO TELL MR. EPSTEIN THAI THEY MAY MAVE BEEN, BUT I COULD NOT

STATE POSITIVELY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AS THERE WERE MAY

POLITICIANS OF THE DAY IN CONTACT WITH HIM.

I RECALLED, IN ANSWER IO HIS QUESTIONS, THAT KING'S WIFE,

CORETTA, WAS IN TOUCH WITH HIM REGARDING HER PLANS TO IRAVEL

TO THE CONVENTION AND ALSO THAT HE WAS IN CONTACI WITH A NOTED

ENTERTAINER, MEHALIA JACKSON, WHO WAS APPEARING AT SOME CLUB IN

ATLANTIC CITY AI THAT TIME, AND WHO WAS APPARENILY AN OLD FRIEND

OF KING'S.

AS TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT INFORMATION WAS TRANSMITTED

TO DE LOACH, I SUPPOSE WE SENT EVERYTHING THAT WOULD INDICATE

ANY ACTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE CONVENTION. I AM VAGUE ON THE

DETAILS OF HOW WE HANDLED THE TRANSCRIPTION AND REPORTING OF

INFORMATION WE RECEIVED. WE MAY NAVE WRITTEN LONGHAND SUMMARIES

OR DICTATEN UTA TE EPHANE TO A STENDGRAPHER:

I WAS AWARE OF ANOTHER INSTALLATION, EITHER ATTEMPTED

OR OPERATED AT. A STORE FRONT OPERATION OF SOME OPGANIZATION

THAT THREATENED DISPUPTION OF THE CONVENTION, BUT I HAD NO

DETAILS CONCERNING IT.

SAC LETTER 68-38

RE

ENCY

a Bureau Agent posing as a newsman was recognized by a representative

of a newspaper that has been traditionally hostile to the FBi. The Special

Agent involved was attempting to identify the demonstrators and those

who were burning their draft cards, and to record statements of various

individuals participating in the demonstration. A distorted news item

regarding the Agent's activities appeared in a subsequent issue of that

paper reflecting the Bureau in an unfavorable light.

Consequently, you should instruct your Agent personnel that,

henceforth, no matter what the justification, they are not to pose as

newsmen or representatives of any wire service for the purpose of

establishing an investigative cover.

As you are aware, a distorted news item appeared in

I the June 18th issue of "The Washington Post" in which it was alleged

that a Special Agent had posed as a representative of the International

News Service (INS) at the anti-draft demonstration in front of the U.S.

Supreme Court on June 17, 1968.

As a matter of background, the Department had requested

FBI coverage of this demonstration; consequently, a Special Agent of the

washington Field Office, corrying a tape recorder, mingled with news-

men at the demonstration in order to identify participants, those who

burned their draft cards, and to record the comments of various spokes-

men for the demonstrators. In response to inquiries from the demonstra-

tors, the Special Agent indicated he was a free-lance reporter. At no time

did he identify himself as a member of INS.

Unfortunately, the Special Agent was recognized by a!

Washington Post reporter who is obviously responsible for the news

report which subsequently appeared in that paper. It is noted that the

Special Agent and his supervisor have since been censured for failing to

anticipate the possibility that the Special Agent might be recognized by

members of the news media present at the demonstration.

Mr. DeLoach has received a leuer from Julius Frandsen,

• Vice President and Washington Manager of Untied Press International (UPI):

who is a good friend of the Bureau and is on the Special Correspondents List.:

• Dear Deke:

n: /

;..:.

I know that various subterfuges necessarily

must be resorted to from time to time.

Duo than thoro are excellent beacone thy

it is undesirable for agents to represent themselves

as

newspapermen and particularly as news agency men.

For one thing, of which you may not be aware,

American correspondents

in many parts of the world have

run into problems because news sources harbor a suspicion

they have undercover U.S. government connections. Our

'non-friends are likely to use references such as were in

the paer Tuesday norning to keep such unfounded suspicions

alive.

In any event, they shouldn't use the name of such

near-reality as "International News Service".

UPE and

INS were merged barely ten years ago to form UPI, and I

believe we still hold rights

to the name of INS.

Re: Request from Ron Kessler

Hanning indicated to Quinn that, in fact, he had participated

in coverage of the aforementioned convention under the supervision of

De Loach who was then Assistant Director of the Crime Records Division

along with Leinbaugh.

It was his recollection that then President Lyndon B.

Johnson had requested the FBI to assist the Secret Service in providing

intelligence information concerning dissident groups and individuals who

might represent a physical threat to the President and members of the

White House staff.

Hanning said that the predication uf the Bureau's assignment in

Atlantic City was reportedly based on a request from President Johnson to

Director Hoover and all those involved in the assignment were not to discuss

this fact. He stated that DeLoach telephonically advised the Director each

day of the results of their efforts in Atlantic City and it was his understanding

that Mr. Hoover in turn passed this information on to the White House. He

also stated that information was disseminated on the scene to a. White House

representative in Atlantic City. He stated he had not personally seen any

written information concerning the above instructions or the results there-

from.

At approximately 11 a.m., 1/23/75, Miss Frances Lurz, a

retired Bureau employee who was C. D. DeLoach's secretary until her

retirement in 1968, called to advise that she is currently a patient in the

George Washington Hospital recovering from a bout with double pneumonia

and that she had been telephonically contacted at 5 p.m. yesterday evening

by Kessler who asked her pointed questions relating to the aforementioned

matter, indicating to her that he had heard that information was telephonically

furnished from Atlantic City to the Crime Records front office, in which she

worked, and that the stenographic personnel in that office transcribed infor-

mation furnished from Atlantic City on the phane "on plain bond paper."

He specifically asked her if she had ever personally delivered material as

• a consequence of this dictation to the White House personally. Kessler

indicated to Miss Lurz that his information was based on testimony furnished

by former Assistant Director Robert E. Wick to the "Watergate Committee."

Miss Lurz advised that she told Kessler that she had been retired for a

number of years, that the period that he was referring to was some 10

years ago and she was unable to recall any specific details concerning

the matters that took place that long ago but that for his information

she had never at any time ever delivered anything to the White House

in connection with Bureau business or otherwise. She advised that

Kessler was polite during the conversation; however, she concluded

the call on the basis that she had no intention of discussing any matters

relating to the FBI with him.

At approximately 12 noon today, Mr. Robert E. Wick,

Vice President, Pan American Airlines, New York City, and a former

Assistant Director of the FBI, advised that he was contacted by

Kessler late yesterday and that Kessler made reference to the same

matter and that he was convinced that Kessler was reading from an

official document of some sort. He (Kessler) refused to identify the

document or where or from whom he had obtained it; however, Wick

cia lu thất in May, 1073, ho was iniCivicrod bý Uho Donald Dangero:

who was then Legal Counsel for the House Committee on Internal Security

on the same subject and that he tried to be helpful to Sanders because

of Sanders' official responsibilities but that even on that occasion,

because of the length of time that had passed, he was unable to give

Sanders much in the way of specific details since he (Wick) was not

personally involved in the FBI coverage of the National Convention

in Atlantic City in 1964, since it was his responsibility to run the front

office in his role as Number One Man of the Division while Mr. De Loach

was away.

Wick advised Kessler that he was displeased to receive

such a call from Kessler, that he consideredKessler's inquiry unwarranted

and unethical and that if Kessler bothered him again, he would consider

discussing Kessler's activities with Ben Bradlee, Executive Editor

. of the "Post."

Re: Request from Ron Kessler

it should be noted that in Jack Anderson's column of 11/12/71, he

mentioned that at the 1964 Convention Mr. Faver assigned an FBI team.

including Mr. C. D. DeLoach, to Johnson. Anderson stated, "The FBI mer

acted as personal, political investigators for BJ who wanted to keep track

of every move at the Atlantic City Convention, particularly the activities of

the late Robert Kennedy whom Johnson distrused. "

It should be noted Bureau files doreveal that by teletype dated

8/20/64 to all offices captioned "Disruption oDèmocratic National Convention.

been received indicating subversive groups, raial groups, racial agitators.

National Convention at Atlantic City, New Jerst., 8/24-29/1964 through

picketing, demonstrating or other activity. Thefield was asked to send

informants to Atlantic City to cover such activités. The communication stated

that the Bureau was not interested in purely poitical activity engaged in by

delegates and others officially attending the Cormention but was interested in

subversive activity, hate group activity, hoodim and criminal activity, or

activity directed at disrupting the Convention. Extensive informant coverage

was put into effect and at one point 39 informant: or potential informants were

scheduled to be in Atlantic City to afford covenge, including communist

youth groups going to the Convention. We alsohad extensive technical coverage

both in Atlantic City and other parts of the county on key figures having con-

appear before the Watergate Grand Jury some 9to 10 months ago but was not

questioned concerning matters previous to 1968.

view SAs Lloyd Nelson, Ben Hale and Bob Taggwhom he believes are assigned

SA Lloyd AjNelson is presently SRA at Atlantic City.

A Robert L. Tagg, presently SRA in Lincoln, Nebraska (Omaha Division),

was assigned to the Atlantic City RA in 1964.

SA Ben D. Hale is presently

assigned to the Memphis Office. He was an Atlantic City RA in 1964.

It

shouid be noted that two female reporters for the "Post"

subsequent to Kessler's last call today requested if they could learn the

offices of assignment of five FBI Agents, names not identified. When

asked as to the purpose of this request and informed that they were for

Kessler both reporters were advised that the offices of assignment of

Agents are not a matter of public record.

Bureau files reveal that in addition to the above coverage being

afforded the Democratic Convention in 1964, similar coverage was also

afforded both the Republican and Democratic Conventions in 1968 and 1972.

Attached are copies of memoranda setting forth instructions to all offices

for coverage with respect to those Conventions.

OBSERVATIONS

Based on the foregoing, Kessler obviously has access to some-

one who has intimate knowledge of the Bureau's investigative role during the

1964 Democratic Convention in Atlantic City. From comments made by

former Bureau Agents who have been contacted by Kessler and advised us

accordingly, it appears that the request for our investigation emanated from

President Johnson to Director Hoover and all involved were requested to

keep this information closely held. Mr. Hoover was advised daily of the

results of our activities in Atlantic City by Mr. DeLoach who in turn

advised the White House. Dissemination was also made in Atlantic City to

White House liaison representatives on the scene. Data from our sources

was disseminated to Secret Service, Washington, D. C., and locally in

Atlantic City, as well as the New Jersey State Police and the Atlantic City

Police Department. Therefore, it is being recommended that we advise

Kessler that as a result of a request from the White House the FBI did

coordinate the development of intelligence information concerning the plans

of subversive criminal and hoodlum groups attempting to disrupt the

Democratic National Convention at Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1964.

This information gathered by FBI informants and sources was subsequently

furnished to the White House and its liaison representatives in Atlantic City:

The Washington Post on Sunday, 1/26/75, carried a front page story by

staff writer Ronald Kessler (attached) reporting that during the 1964 Democratic

National Convention, President Johnson received reports on key convention

delegates from "wiretaps and bugs" installed by the FBI on civil rights leaders,

and attributed this information to a Senate Watergate Committee memorandum.

The article summarizes a 1973 interview with Leo T. Clark (EOD as a Special

Agent 1/11/43, retired 2/1/65 as Senior Resident Agent, Atlantic City), and

quotes Clark as saying the information was reported to President Johnson based

on an installation in the hotel suite of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and a store

front used by civil rights leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate

Committee that the electronic and physical surveillances at the convention were

carried out by a special FBI team ordered by White House and was under the

personal direction of Cartha D. DeLoach, then an Assistant Director. According

to Clark, the stated purpose of the operation was to gather intelligence on

potential violence or disruption and Clark is reported as stating DeLoach told

him to avoid discussing the operation with the Secret Service.

The news article continues Clark stated most of the information obtained

by the FBI was transmitted to President Johnson over a telephone line specially.

)y installed to bypass the White House switchboard. According to the news article,

Clark said information furnished included the activities of then Attorney General

Robert F. Kennedy, identities of Senatos and Congressmen visiting King's

hotel suite as well as persons seeking support of civil rights leaders, plans of

delegates or delegations and speculation on Vice Presidential nominees.

Kessler's article states the authenticity of the Clark memorandum which

cites room numbers of hotel suites bugged and the source of funds for part of

the operation were verified by persons who either received it or were present

when Clark was interviewed. The article also states the FBI solicited intelligence

through Agents posing as reporters. According to the article, the memorandum

indicates Clark appeared in response to a subpoena but did not testify under oath.

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

Kessler's article indicates he has had access to the 1973 Senate Watergate

interview of DeLoach and spells out DeLoach's denial under oath having had a

direct line to President Johnson or laving spoken with the President during the

convention. Kessler also states one surveillance was conducted as part of a

continuing installation on a person believed to be under the influence of the

Communist Party which had been approved by Kennedy.

Kessler's article came as no surprise inasmuch as last week DeLoach

and several other retired and current Bureau employees reported they had been

contacted by Kessler for comments concerning the Bureau's operations at the

Democratic National Convention in 1964.

A review of the file of retired SA Clark contains no information that he

was interviewed by the Senate Watergate Committee at any time or has been in

touch with the Bureau in this regard.

APPARENT LEAK CONCERNING FBI PARTICIPATION AT

1964 CONVENTION

In connection with the 1973 hearings held by the Senate Watergate Com-

mittee, John Dean, on 6/27/73, testified and identified certain documents

which he previously had furnished to the committee. Among those documents

were items referred to during the testimony as the "Sullivan Memoranda" which

were not admitted into evidence by Chairman Sam Ervin. Subsequent contact •

with the Deputy Chief Counsel of the committee determined the committee had.

no intention of releasing the Sullivan Memoranda or even publishing them with

the committee reports. The counsel stated he would discuss with the chairman

the possibility of making a copy of the Sullivan Memoranda available to the FBI.

On 7/25/73 the counsel advised the Bureau that the chairman had agreed the FBI

should have this information and in turning copies of the documents over to the

F'Bl stated only he, Rufus Edmisten, and the other staff member who had inter-

viewed Sullivan for the committee had reviewed the memoranda.

The material turned over to the Bureau included four separate items

and two envelopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office

Building marked "Personal"' and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret." The first document, all of which is typed,

is headed re "President Johnson, Politics of the FBI." This one-page document

concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on 11/12/68 for the FBI to

check all outgoing telephone calls made by the then Vice Presidential candidate,

Mr. Spiro Agnew, on the date of 11/2/68 when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New

Mexico. This document states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.m., 11/13/68

to ask about the progress the FBI was making in this matter. (This matter

pertains to the Mrs. Claire Chennault matter. A second item concerns an

alleged request by Marvin Watson on 2/18/66 for the fBI to cover senate

Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page indicates

President

Johnson asked the FBI to determine if Repullicans were involved in instigating

a riot in New York.

The second document consists of one typewritten page labeled "Top

Secret"' and the heading "Preface" and is a general recitation of alleged FBI

involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far exceeded Roosevelt

in using the FBI for political purposes.

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI,' is marked

"Top Secret," and consists of three pages. It cites 10 alleged incidents of mis-

use of the FBI by President Johnson as follows: (1) Re: Mrs. Claire Chennault

and Embassy of South Vietnam, (2) Re: Democratic National Convention Atlantic

City, N. J. 1964, (3) Re: Don Reynolds (a personality in the Bobby Baker case),

Jenkins, (7) Re: Mrs. Claire Chennault, Embassy of South Vietnam, (8) Re:

The fourth documents reads as follows: "John, Please see the enclosure

the contents of which are self-explanatory.

If I am to type my observations myself

please be tolerant of my poor typing. Bill."

The fifth document bears a marking "Secret" re 'Watergate." This is an

offer on the part of Sullivan to testify before the Watergate Committee in behalf

of the Administration and by doing so could put the current (Nixon) administration

in a very favorable light.

some of it had been published regarding the checking of Agnew's telephone calls.

Hearst Publications, who claimed they knew that Sullivan had given John Dean

a memorandum alleging FBI political assistance to the Johnson Administration

and the memorandum had been turned over to the Ervin Committee. While the

reporters claimed they had not seen copies of the memorandum, DeLoach felt

they knew the contents of the memorandum based on the questions they asked.

Subsequently, DeLoach advised the Bureau that he had received a

subpoena to appear before the Senate Watergate Committee on 10/3/73 and this

subpoena was discussed with the Department with the recommendation that an

appropriate attorney be designated to appear with Mr. DeLoach to represent

the interests of the United States.

By letter to the Director dated 12/7/73, DeLoach advised that he furnished

three hours of testimony to Senator Howard Baker and minority counsel, former

SA Donald Sanders and a stenotypist who was present. He advised the testimony

was under oath and in executive session and the questioning was largely based

on the memorandum furnished by Sullivan to John Dean. DeLoach reported that

Senator Baker was most thorough, courteous and polite and on the advice and

instructions of then Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus he attempted to

answer every question with blunt honesty and Department Regulation 1622 was

utilized only once pertaining to the usage of an electronic surveillance as au-

thorized by former Attorney General Kennedy.

DeLoach was subsequently interviewed by the Watergate Special Prosecution

Force in about January, 1974. However, according to sA Angelo Lano oi

Washington Field Office, DeLoach's testimony in this regard pertained to the 17

wiretaps and did not go into the 1964 coverage of the Democratic Convention..

REVIEW OF BUREAU FILES AND CURRENT INQUIRY CONCERNING

THIS MATTER

Bureau files show that on 8/20/64 a teletype was directed to all continental

offices captioned, "Disruption of Democratic National Convention, Information

Concerning (Internal Security)." This teletype advises information has been received

which indicates subversive groups, racial groups, racial agitators, hoodlums and

the criminal element may attempt to disrupt the convention in Atlantic City and

the Bureau must be advised of all such subversive criminal, hoodlum and racial

elements who plan to be in Atlantic City during this period. Other general.

instructions were set forth concerning informant availability. A follow-up instruc-.

tion was sent out 8/21/64 that any information of extreme importance or urgency

should be submitted immediately by teletype or telephone to the Bureau. This

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

file, 100-442527, consisting of three sections, sets forth numerous communi-

cations from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting forth

pertinent developments. The only information located in Bureau files concerning

the special squad in Atlantic City was an eight-page memorandum (copy attached)

with enclosure located in the file of DeLoach. This is a memorandum from

DeLoach to Mohr dated 8/29/64 which sets forth that in connection with the

assignment of the special squad in Atlantic City at the direction of the President,

DeLoach wished to report the successful completion of this assignment. He

states that by means of informant coverage, use of various confidential tech-

niques, infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were able to

keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments. De Loach also

advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic City with Secret

¡Service as well as state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther

King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar coverage established on the lead-

quarters of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) - Student Nonviolent

¡ Coordinating Committee (SNCC). DeLoach states he was able to advise the

White House in advance of all plans made by these two sources and coverage

was highly effective. DeLoach advises "with Bureau approval" he instituted

coverage on CORE - SNCC headquarters at their meeting hall and our Negro

undercover agents penetrated the headquarters of the Mississippi Freedom

Democratic Party (two separate factions were contesting seats for the Mississippi

delegation and was a highlight of the convention) and through cooperation with the

management of NBC' news our Agents were furnished NBC press credentials.

De Loach reported that 44 pages of intelligence data was disseminated to Walter

Jenkins at the White House and to his memorandum he attached a copy of these

daily summaries dated 8/24, 25, 26, 27/64. These summaries are in effect

a running log of developments which took place at the convention. DeLoach also

states he arranged for a lease line between the control post at Atlantic City and

the Bureau. He concludes the memorandum by making recommendations that

personnel involved, namely 27 Agents, one radio maintenance technician and

two stenographers of the Newark Office be commended. Mr. Hoover noted

DeLoach should receive a meritorious award.

Bureau file 62-48771, serial 218, reflects a memorandum from Mr.

Hoover wherein Walter W. Jenkins, Special Assistant to the President, called

thought the job the Bureau had done in Atlantic City was one Of the finest the

President had ever seen.

According to this memorandum, Jenkins told Mr.

Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and because of the work

some of the Bureau people did they knew exactly where they were and what

they were doing and consequently they were not able to be very effective. It

should be noted that this particular memorandum of Mr. Hoover's, dated

19/10/64, is referred to in Sullivan's documents sent to John Dean and Sullivan

not only refers to the correct date of this memorandum and Jenkins' call to Deletes

Mr. Hoover but Sullivan quotes a portion of the wording of this memorandum from

setting the wording in quotes which would ndicate that Sullivan may well hare ret

Custo

an unauthorized copy of this particular memorandum and took it with him as

well as other information when he retired in 1971. This apparent action by

Sullivan could possibly constitute a violation of the Theft of Government Propertyin

Prosecution

Statute (Title 18, U: S. Code, Section 641).

A thorough review of Bureau records, including a review of abstracts

of Mr. Hoover, Mr. Tolson, Mr. Mohr,"

*as well as Mr. DeLoach, failed to

locate any memorandum or other document pertaining to a request having been

received from President Johnson or anyone at the White House instructing

that the FBI afford special coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House and had

a direct line at his residence to the President so it well may be that this request

was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it orally with Mr. Hoover

- for Mr. Tolson but for one reason or another the request was never put in

writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL STILL ON ACTIVE DUTY

On 1/26/75 the Inspection Division directed a teletype incorporating

12 questions to the 19 Agents and one radio maintenance technician who are

still on active duty and were. with DeLoach at Atlantic City. These questions

were designed to have the participating personnel furnish us with their recol-

lection as to their duties and involvement at Atlantic City. Detailed responses

were promptly received and all personnel acknowledged their participation on

the special squad under DeLoach's leadership at the convention. All responded

there was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

City to fulfill the FBI's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not feel that

the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically, the instruc-

Itions to the Agents were to develop advance information regarding any acts or

intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances that could arise during

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECHNICAL COVERAGE AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files contain a

memorandum to the Attorney General dated 10/7/63 captioned 'Martin Luther

King, Jr., security Matter - Communist; Communist Influence in Racia!

Matters, " wherein the Bureau recommended that authority be granted to place

a technical surveillance on King at his current address (Atlanta, Georgia) or

at any future address to which he may move. This memorandum was approved

by Attorney General Kennedy, 10/10/63. A memorandum F. J. Baumgardner

¡to W. C. Sullivan, 7/7/64, captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro Question,

Communist Influence and Racial Matters - IS - C," pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to install three additional technical surveillances on the facilities

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conterence (SCLC) in Atlanta. The memo-

randum observed that the Attorney General has already authorized technical

coverage of the SCLC and King and additional authority is not necessary since

this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about by additional.

telephone service

within the SCLC.

Memorandum J. A. Sizoo to W. C. Sullivan, 8/24/64, captioned 'Martin

8/21/64 concerning technical coverage on King in Atlantic City. Bachman had

previously received instructions from Sullivan that he explore the possibility

of putting technical and microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising

that a technical installation could be done and reliable contacts were available

lat the hotel concerning a microphone installation. The memorandum pointed

out Bachman was given the go-ahead with the microphone installation as well as

the telephone installation. Sizoo reiterates the Bureau has authority from the

Attorney General to cover any residences which King may use with a technical

installation.

Memorandum to Mr. Callahan

Re: Special Squad at Democratic National Convention

Atlantic City, New Jersey, 8/22 - 28/64

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary CORE - SNCC

headquarters in a store on Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of Bureau records

fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization for same. A search of

microphone authorizations in the Newark Office likewise fails to locate any

authorization for this particular installation. At the time of the convention in

1964, our authority for microphone surveillance was maintained at the Seat of

Government and authorization for utilizing microphone surveillances was made

.. by the Director who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Brownell

dated 5/20/54, which recognized FBI authority to institute such surveillances.

By memorandum dated 9/27/65 Attorney General Katzenbach agreed to continue

the use of microphone surveillances only following his personal authorization.

It is pointed out that DeLoach's memorandum reporting the coverage at Atlantic

City mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau approval."

In 1964 our investigation of SNCC was based on information that an

apparent member of the Communist Party, USA, was engaging in considerable

activity, much in a leadership capacity in SNCC. Confidential informants

reported that SNCC, among the various civil rights organizations, was a

principal target for Communist Party infiltration. At this same period of time

our investigation of CORE was limited to determining whether in fact there was

communist infiltration in that organization. (While a question arises as to the

justification of using a microphone surveillance against CORE per se, it is

noted that we did in fact have a pending investigation on SNCC and the fact SNCC

was engaged in a joint temporary office with CORE during the convention may

well have been justification for installing the microphone surveillance. A review

lof available material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newark files contain a memorandum dated 8/22/64 concerning the

technical surveillance which verifies that the work on two phones in King's rooms

at the hotel had been completed; however, the personnel at Atlantic City could

not place the mike on King in view of the fact they had to leave the room. Newark

files also attribute to SRA Clark that on Bureau instructions a mike should be

considered for temporary CORE headquarters at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic

City. The only other information contained in Newark files concerning these

installatións is in Newark file 100-47520, Sub I, which contains a handwritten log

consisting of approximately 50 pages of overhears on King's telephones.

A review of blue slip items submitted by the Newark Office to the Bureau

for August, 1964, shows $100 was paid to one Eugene Hornberger, owner of a

bakery shop at 2416 Atlantic Avenue for dismissing his bakery personnel during

the early morning hours of 8/23-24/64 to allow FBI Agents access to his shop.

His bakery was located adjacent to CORE headquarters located at 2414 Atlantic

Avenue and this payment was authorized by DeLoach on 8/25/64. A second

blue slip item was paid on 8/14/64 to the New Jersey Telephone Company in

the amount of $28.82 for a lease line and this expenditure was authorized by

De Loach..

SA Supervisor Conrad Thompson, currently assigned to the Intelligence

Division, advised that in 1964 he was a supervisor in the Newark Office. Con-

cerning the convention at Atlantic City, he recalls SAC Bachman advising he had

received instructions that DeLoach while in Atlantic City would handle all com-

munications with the Bureau directly from Atlantic City rather than relaying

information to the Newark Office. Thompson recalls that Bachman was un-

happy at being cut out by Deloach because Bachman was being queried by

W. C. Sullivan as to what was going on in Atlantic City and, of course, he could

Inot furnish such information to Sullivan when DeLoach was dealing directly with

the Bureau.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER BY AGENTS

As set forth above, both in the Washington Post article as well as

De Loach's memorandum, reporting the activities of the special squad at the

convention, some of the Agents utilized media identification of the National

Broadcasting Company. At that time there was no Bureau rule prohibiting the

use of such investigative technique. SAC Letter 60-30, dated 1/2/60, Item

B, entitled "Investigative Covers," sets forth that all Agent personnel are

prohibited to pose as newsmen or representatives of any wire service for

the purpose of establishing an investigative cover. This rule was invoked

after a news item appeared in the Washington Post on 6/18/68 alleging that

one of our Agents had posed as a representative of the International News

Service while covering an anti-draft demonstration at the Supreme Court on

6/17/68. The allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct

statement as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the

demonstration.

COVERAGE OF 1964 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION,

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

Review of Bureau records fails to establish that any specialized coverage

was afforded to the Republican National Convention held in San Francisco in

July, 1964, and the only references in our records relate to the planning and

execution by CORE of demonstrations and picketing especially insofar as the

nomination of Senator Barry Goldwater was concerned. Several teletypes were

submitted by San Francisco concerning the demonstrations and follow-up letter-

head memoranda were received by the Bureau and disseminated.

RECOMMENDED ACTION

1. That this memorandum be forwarded to Office of Legal Counsel to

review applicable Federal criminal statutes concerning culpability of retired

Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan making available confidential

information from Bureau files to John Dean. There is strong evidence to

indicate that Sullivan has in his possession information from Bureau files and

2. Following this review, action be instituted looking toward prosecution

of Sullivan for violation of the applicable Federal statute or statutes.

conventions of both political parties.

civil rights workers in Mississippi. Furthermore, information was received

that the parents of one of these individuals would appear at a rally during the

DNC.

On 8/25/64 Assistant Director Cartha DeLoach telephoned a memorandum

to Mr. Mohr from Atlantic City to the effect information from Walter Jenkins

and informants indicated the question of seating the MFDP delegates was expected

to reach the floor of the DNC the evening of 8/25/64. He said 'The crucial point

of the convention in so far as possible violence is concerned will occur between

4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. this afternoon. If the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party is not seated then the unruly elements within the Negro group will possibly

attempt to demonstrate." DeLoach indicated that every effort was being extended

to cover developments pertinent to this possible violent situation.

There follows under appropriate caption in summary form information

relative to our coverage at the DNC.

COVERAGE RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL CIVIL UNREST,

DEMONSTRATIONS AND POSSIBLE VIOLENCE

A review of the summaries furnished to Walter Jenkins by Mr. DeLoach

during the DNC indicates over 25 separate entries dealing with demonstrations

insofar as their times, places, groups involved, number of participants, and

general nature thereof were concerned. A great majority of the Bureau person-

nel still on active duty who were assigned to this special squad in Atlantic City

have indicated that the attaining of intelligence information relative to possible

violent civil disorders was the primary purpose of their efforts during the DNC.

Our coverage in this regard was handled through extensive informant

coverage at Atlantic City and as a result of information received from informants

in other parts of the country as well. Additionally, we utilized Agents in various

undercover capacities to develop such information.

Furthermore, a great deal

of information in this regard was, in fact, received as a result of the technical

coverage utilized. Where appropriate, the information obtained was disseminated

to the U. S. Secret Service and other interested law enforcement agencies as

well.

ACTIVITIES RELATIVE TO THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT

A review of the interviews of the previously mentioned special squad

personnel still on active duty has indicated that a majority of them felt that their

assignment in part was related to the augmenting of the U. S. Secret Service in-

sofar as the protection of the President was concerned. One Agent indicated

that Bureau personnel did, in fact, actively assist in the protection of the

President and his family while they were at the DNC.

A review of Bureau file 100-442527 captioned "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)" did not reveal

any information directly relating to the protection of the President.

A review of the DeLoach summaries to Mr. Jenkins indicated one

instance where a demonstration was planned to take place upon the President's

arrival at convention hall and another incident which revealed a breach of

security which allowed an individual to enter the convention hall and proceed

directly to the podium area. This information was furnished immediately to

the U. S. Secret Service.

Information is contained in the interviews of the former special squad

personnel that FBI Agents were utilized in supplementing U. S. Secret Service

personnel on the convention hall floor.

INFORMATION DEVELOPED OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE

A further review of the DeLoach summaries revealed approximately

20 separate items which do not appear to relate directly with possible civil

unrest - demonstrations or with the protection of the President. These items

were developed as a result of the various types of coverage we had at the DNC

but a great number thereof were obtained through our technical coverage. A

sampling of these items includes the following:

1. King planning telegram to the President concerning his undue

nfluence relative to the seating of the MEDP.

:2. Informant information received that Congressman Adam Clayton

Powell was carrying a revolver.

3. Informant information relative to National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People planning a meeting at a church.

4. Informant relative to King's speaking before various state delegations.

5. Information that the Congress of Racial Equality headquarters in

Atlantic City was attempting to have Congressman Charles Diggs' office in

Detroit, Michigan, picketed, claiming he was "shakey:"

6. Information that Bayard Rustin was inquiring as to who King could

contact to put pressure on the White House. Additionally, there was some talk

of a compromise relative to the questioned seating and of the fact the MEDP

would accept it:

• A review of the handwritten technical logs of the coverage on Martin

Luther King at Atlantic City reveals, in addition to some of the items stated

above, considerable information was obtained of the hour-by-hour strategy

followed by King, Rustin, and others in their efforts to seat MFDP in the con-

vention. Mentioned and overheard were several Congressmen, Senators and

Governors of states who were acting in capacity of delegates to the convention.

Also obtained was information that Bayard Rustin felt the MFDP group,

following their rejection by the credentials committee, planned to steal passes

and enter the convention illegally. He was worried about dangerous and ir-

responsible leadership in the group.

Allegations in the press that the coverage of the FBI was used to

follow the activities of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy were not substantiated

in any way by file reviews.

A review of the statements furnished by the special squad personnel

includes various instances where they relate a portion of their overall purpose

was to insure that there was nothing which would "embarrass the President."

One Agent indicated that DeLoach placed emphasis on the fact that the

President did not wish to be embarrassed in any way and that information was

to be gathered which would assure that there would be no:such embarrassment.

-==

• Two statements were furnished by Bill D. Williams, present SAC in

Kansas City in this regard. One states "I would like to state that at no time did

I ever consider the above to be a political operation but it was obvious that

DeLoach wanted to impress Jenkins and Moyers with the Bureau's ability to

develop information which would be of interest to them". Furthermore, in

response to a question as to whether the Bureau's services were being utilized

for political reasons, Williams answered, 'No.

I do recall, however, that

on one occasion I was present when DeLoach held a lengthy telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins. Theyappeared to be discussing the President's 'image.'

At the end of the conversation DeLoach told us something to the effect, 'that

may have sounded a little political to you but this doesn't do the Bureau any

harm."

Other Agent personnel on the special squad indicated in the negative

insofar as the above question is concerned.

DISSEMINATION

In addition to the summary memoranda furnished by DeLoach to

Mr. Jenkins, information is contained in Bureau file 100-442527, cited above,

that some of the same information was included in daily letters to the White

House and the Attorney General on current Racial Developments. There was

similar dissemination made to U. S. Secret Service, military intelligence

agencies and local authorities on a selected basis.

RECOMMENDED ACTION

For information. It should be noted the information contained

herein setting forth that the White House and the Department made requests

in 1964 for information from Bureau files concerning the MFDP has been

incorporated into a separate LHM being prepared for the Deputy Attorney

General.

SPECIAL SQUAD AT DEVOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION

ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY

AUGUST: 22 - 28, 3994

Pursuant to your request concerning captioned matter, tha

Washington Post on Sunday, January 26, 1975, carried a front page

story by staff writer Ronald Kessler reporting that during the 1961

Democratic National Convention, Presideni Johnson received reports

on key convention delegates from "wiretaps and bugs" installed by

the FBI on civil rights leaders, and attriouted tis information to a

Senate Watergale Committee memorandum. The article summarizes

a 1973 interview by the Committee with Iso T. Clark who on his

Atlantic City. Kessler quotes Claris as saying the information was

reported to President Johnson based on an installation in the hotel

suite of Di. Martin' Luther Bing, Jr., and a storefront used by civil.

rignts leaders. Clark allegedly told the Senate Watergate Committee

that the electronic and physical surveillances at the convention were

carried out by a Special FBI team ordered by the White House and was

under the personal direction of Cartha D, DeLoach, then an Assistant

Director.

According to Claris, the stated purpose of the operation was

to gather intelligence on potential violence or disruption and Clark is

reported as stating BeLoach told him to avoid discussing the oparation

with the Secret Service .

The news article continues Clark stated most of the informa-

tion cbtained by the FBI was tansmitted to President Johnson over a

telephone line specially installed to bypass the White House switchboard.

According to the news article, Cart said information farnished included

the activities of then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, identities a

Senators and Congressmen visiting King's hotel suite as well as persons

seeking support of civil rights leaders, plans a delegates or delegations

and speculation on Vice Presidential nominees.

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THE "SULLIVAN MEMORANDA"

In connection with the 1978 hearings held by the Senate

Watergate Committee, John Dean, on June 27, 1973, testified and identi-

fled certain documents which he previcusly had furnished to the Committee:

Among those documeats were items referred to during the testimony

as the "Sullivan memoranda, " apparently authored by William C. Sullivan,

former Assistant to the Director, who retired on Detober 21, 1971.

These typed documents consisted of fiva separate ltems and two enve-

lopes, one addressed to John Dean at the Old Executive Office Building

marked "Personal" and an inner envelope bearing Dean's name with

the words "Eyes Only" and "Secret. " The first document is headed

"President Johnson, Politics of the FBi. " This one-page document

concerned an alleged request by President Johnson on iovember 12,

1968; for the FBI to check all outgoing telephone calls made by the thea

Vice Presidential candidate, Air, Spiro Agnew, on the date of November 2;

1988, when Agnew was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This document

states President Johnson called at 4:00 p.M., November 13, 1953, ta

as' about the progress the FBl was mating in this maiter. - (This matter

pertains to the Mrs. Clairs Chennault matter.) A second item concerns

an alleged request by Maryin Watson en February 18, 1966, for the FBI

to cover Senate Foreign Relations hearings and a third item on the page

indicates President Johnson asted the FBI to datermine il Republicans

were involved in inselgating a riot in New York.

The second document consists of one typewritten pags labeled

"Top Secret" and the heading "Preface" and is a general recitation ol

alleged F'BI involvement in politics and alleges President Johnson far

exceeded Roosevelt in using the FBI for political purposes.

The third document is headed "President Johnson and the FBI, "

is marked "Top Secret," and consists of three pages. It cites ten alleged

incidents of misuse oi the FBI by President Johnson as follows: (1) Re:

Virs. Claire Chennault and Embassy oi South Vietnam; R) Re:: Democratic

The iiith document bears a marking "Secret" re "Watergata."

This is an oiler on the part of Sullivan to tastily before the Watergate

Committee in behalf of the Administration and by doing so could pat the

current (Nixon) Administration in a very faverable light.

In my letter dated October 2, 1973, to then Deputy Atiorney

Other general instructions were set forth concerning informant availability.

follow-up instraction was sant out August 21, 1984, that any information

di extreme importance or urgensy should be submitted immediately by

teletype or telephone to the Bureau. Our files set forth numerous com-

munications from the field as well as Bureau memoranda prepared setting

forth pertinent developmenta. In a memorandum dated August 29, 1964,

Mr. DeLoach: set forth a resume of his assignment with a special

squad

of FBI personnel at the Democratic National Convention: DeLoach

reported the suecessful completion of this assignment. He statas that

infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, wa were

able to keep the Walte House fully apprised of all major developmenis.

DeLoach also advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic

City with Secret Service as well as state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidentlal coverage of

Viartin Luther King and Bayard Rustin, along with similar coverage

established on the headquarters of the Congress of Racial Equallty -

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. DeLoach states he was

The Depuly Attorney General

Jenkins told Vir. Hoover there were a lot of bad elements up there and

because of the work some of the Bureau reople did they knew exactly

where they were and what they were doing and consequently they were

not able to be very eftective. It should be noted that this particular

memoranáur of Mr. Hoover's is referred to in Sullivan's documents

sent to Jobs Dean:

À thorough review of Bureau records failed to locate any memo.

randums or other documents pertaining to a request having been received

from Preaident Johnson or anyone at the White Houss instructing that the

FBlahlord special coverage at the convention. • it should be noted that

at this time Deloach was responsible for liaison with the White House

and had a direct line at his residad to the President so it well may be

that this request was made direcily to Deleach who in turn discussed it

orally with MI. Hoover or Mir. Toison but for one reason or another the

request was never put in writing.

STATEMENTS OF SPECIAL SQUAD PERSONNEL.

STELL ON ACTIVE DUTY

Nineteen Special Agents and one radio maintenance technician

who were involved in the special squad assignment and remain on active

duty with the FBI have contimed their participation on the squzd under

DeLoach's leadership at the convention. These employees advised there

was no question in their mind a the time but that thay were in Atlantic

City to fulfill the FBi's jurisdictional responsibilities and they did not

feel that the purpose of the special squad was political in nature. Basically:

the instractions to the Agents were to develop advance information regard-

ing any acts or intended acts of violence pertaining to civil disturbances

that could arise during the convention as well as secondary protection for

the President.

Two of the Agents, both black, were there in undercover

assigament roies. Certain Agents had responsibility for liaison with

Sécret Service, others were handling the large number of taformants

that we moved into Atlantic City and other Agents were utilized in oparating

the technical surveillance on King as well as the microphone installation

installed at the Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee headquarters in Atlantic City. All knew DeLoach was in chaige

and he had with him in Atlantic City three Agants from his ottice and they

were aware that DeLoach was frequently calling the Bureau reporting

developments. Two Agents recalled DeLoach having a telephone conversa-

tion with Walter Jenkins who it is believed was in Washington, D. C., at

the time.

AUTHORIZATION FOR TECENICAL. COVERACE

AT CONVENTION

Concerning the technical installation on King, Bureau files

contain a memorandur to the Altorey General daied October 7, 1963,

captioned 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Securty Matter - Communist;

Communist Influence in Racial Matters," wherein the Bureau recon-

mended that zuthority be granted to place a technical surveillance on

King at his current address (Atlanta, Ceorgia) ir at any future address

to which he may nove. This memorandum was approved by Attorey

General Kennedy, Octeber 10; 1983. A memorandum dated July 7,

1984, captioned "Communist Farty, USA, Negro Question, Communist

influence and Racial Matters - IS. - C," pertains to a request by the

Atlanta Office to install three additical technical surveillances on the

facilities oî the Southern Christian Leadership Conferenco in Atlanta.

The memorandum ehserved that the Attorey General had already

authorized technical coverage on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and King and additional authority was not necessary since

tas is merely an exitusivi a cuito coverago be vight about by nada

tional telephone service within the Southern Christian Leadership

cinterence..

Another memorandum prepared by an oificial of the then

Domestic Intelligence Division dated August 24, 1964, and captioned

"Martin Luther King" reports a telephone, call from SAC Bachman at

Newark on August 21, 1964, concerning technical coverage on King in

Atlantie City. Bachman had previously received instructions from a

Division oificial that he explore the possibility of patting techuical and

microphone coverage on King and Bachman was advising that a tech-

nical installarion could be done and reliable contaris mera avallable at

the hotel concerning a microphone installation. Ibe memorandum

pointed out Bachman was given the go-ahead with the microphone

installation as well as the telephone installation.

This memorandum

reiterates the Bureau had authority from the Attorney Ceneral to cover

any residences which King may use with a technical installation.

Concerning the microphone installation at the temporary

Congress of Racial Equality - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

beacquarters in a store at 2414 Atlantic Avenue, a thorough review of

Bureau records fails to locate any memorandum containing authorization

for same. A search of microphone autherizations in the Newark Office

The Deputy Attorney General

likewise faiis to locate any authorization for this particular installation.

At the time of the convention in 1964, our authority for microphone

surveillance was maintained at the seat of Goverzent and authoriza-

tion for utilizing microphone surveillances was made by the Direcior

who relied on a memorandum from Attorney General Browell dated

May 20, 1954, which recognized IBI authority to institute such sur-

reillances. By memorandum daled September 24, 1035, Attorney-

General Katzenbach agreed to continue the use oi microphone surveil-

lances only following his personal authorization. It is pointed out that

DeLoach's memorandur roporting the coverage a Atlantic City

mentions such technical coverage "with Bureau apprcval."

"..-

In 1964 our Investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committe was based on information that an apparent member of the

Communist Party, USA, was engazing in considerable activity, much

in z leadersbip capacity in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

Confidential informants reported that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee, among the various civil rights organirations, was a principal

target for Communist Party infilization, At this same peried of time our

investigation di the Songress of Racial Equaliy was limited 10 deter

mining whether in fact there was communist infiltration in that organisa.

tiota: While a question arises as to the justification of using a microphone

surveillance against the Congress of Racial Equality par se, it is noted

that we did in fact have a pending investigation on the Sudent Nonviolent

Coordinating Committes and the fact the Student Nonviolent Coordinatiag

Committee was engaged in a joint temporary office with the Congress of

Racial Equaliy during the convention may well have beeu justification

for inscalling the microphone surveillance. A review of availabia

material to date located no specific documentation for this decision.)

Newaris files contain a memorandum dated August 22, 1904,

concerning the technical surveillance which verities that the work on

two phones in King's rooms at the hotel had been completed; however,

the personnel at Atlantic City could not place the mike on Bing in yiew

of the fact they bad to leave the room. Newark files also attribuie to

then Senior Resident Agent Clark that on Burezu instructions a mike

shoald be considered for the temporary Congress of Pacial Equality

headquarters at 2414 Atlantie Avenue, Atlantic City. The cly other

information contained in Nevars flles concerning these installations ia

a handwritten log consisting di seventy-eight pages of overhears on

King's telophones.

UTILIZATION OF NEWS MEDIA COVER SY AGENTS

As set forth abore, both in the Washington Post article as well

2s DeLoach's memorardum, reporting the activities of the special squad

at the convention, some of the Agents utilized media identification of NBC.

At that time there was no Bureau mile prohibiting the use di such inves

tigative technique. On July 2, 1968, Instructions were set forth that all

Agent persenel are prehibited to pose as newsmen or representatives

di any wire service lor the purpose of establishing an investigatire

cover. This rule was invosed after a news liem appeared in the

Washington Post on June 18, 1968, alleging that one of our Agents had

posed as a representative di the International News Service while covering

an antidrait demonstration at the Supreme Court on June 17, 1968. The

allegation alluded to by the newspaper was in fact a correct statement

as to the Agent using the news media as his cover for being at the

demonstration.

ARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

SII-C

At 5:30 p.m., 8/20/64, Assistant Director William

Sullivan telephoned from the Bureau.

He stated that accocains

to Bureau information KING 1s to arrive at the Claridge Hotel

• Atlantic City, N. J., on Saturday, 8/22/64, or Sunday, 8/23/64.

that we should arrange tesur and misur coverage but shoula noo

go beyond one man at the hotel in ascertaining the room assign-

ments of KING. He authorized us to rent a room at the hotel

for monitoring.

At 3:51 p.m., 8/21/64, I telephonically advised

Mr. Sullivan

that KING

is on the V.I.P. list at

the hotel, his

reservations having been made by the Democratic National Com-

mitree; that he previously requested three single connecting

starling sunday, Grab/ot, that in nord has boon acocared

from the hotel of a possible earlier arrival date; that the

hotel tentatively plans

to assign him Rooms 1901, 1902 and 1923,

the latter connecting with 1901, but being around the corner

from the other two; that the hotel at this time has a problem

as Room 1923 is occupied and although the people previously

checking in at the hotel were advised that the room should be

vacated by 8/23/64 because of the convention, the hotel has had

no word from the occupants of Room 1923 as to whether he plans

to abide by théseinstructions; that we have obtained for our

use Room 1821.

Mr. Sullivan stated that it would be permissible to

go ahead and effect tesur and misur coverage in 1901 and 1902

and to handle 1923 when it 1s vacated.

SAC LETTER 68-38

(8)/ INVESTIGATIVE COVERS. -- At a recent antidrait demonstration

a Bureau Agent posing as a newsman was recognized by a representativel

of a newspaper that has been traditionally hostile to the FBI. The Specia

Agent involved was attempting to identify the demonstrators and those

who were burning their draft cards, and to record statements of various

individuals participating in the demonstration. A distorted news item

regarding the Agent's activities appeared in a subsequent issue of that

paper reflecting the Bureau in an unfavorable light.

Consequently, you should instruct your Agent personnel that,

henceforth, no matter what the justification, they are not to pose as

newsmen or representatives of any wire service for the purpose of

establishing an investigative cover.

As you are aware, a distorted news item appeared in

I the June 18th issue of "The Washington Post" in which it was alleged

that a Special Agent had posed as a representative of the International

News Service (INS) at the anti-draft demonstration in front of the U.S.

Supreme Court on June 17, 1968.

As a matter of background, the Department had requested

FBI coverage of this demonstration; consequently, a Special Agent of the

washington Field Office, corrying a tape recorder, mingled with news.

men ai the demonstration in order to identify participants, those who

burned their drait cards, and to record the comments of various spokes -

men for the demonstrators. In response to inquiries from the demonstra-

tors, the Special Agent indicated he was a free-lance reporter. At no time

(did he identify himself as a member of INS.

Unfortunately, the Special Agent was recognized by a

Washington Post reporter who is obviously responsible for the news!

report which subsequently appeared in that paper. It is noted that the

Special Agent and his supervisor have since been censured for failing to

anticipate the possibility that the Special Agent might be recognized by

members of the news media present at the demonstration.

Mr. DeLoach has received a letier from Julius Frandsen,

•Vice President and Washington Manager of United Press International (UPI), *

who is a good friend of the Bureau and is on the Special Correspondents List

pointing out the undesirable features of having Agents represent themselves

as newsmen. The Director has noted, "We must never use cover of a

newspaper nor of a wire service. H."

Dear Deke:

Dui I thim thors are execllent regenne thy

it is undesirable for agents to represent themselves as

newspapermen and particularly as news agency men.

For one thing,

of which you may not be aware,

American correspondents in many parts of the world have

run into problems because news sources harbor a suspicion

they have undercover U.S. government connections.

Our

'non-friends are likely to use references such as were in

the paer Tuesday morning to keep such unfounded suspicions

alive.

In any event, they shouldn't use the name of such

a near-reality as "International News Service".

UP& and

INS were merged barely ten years ago to form UPI, and I

believe we still hold rights

to the name of INS.
