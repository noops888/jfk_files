MEMORANDUM FOR:

Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

Supplementary Information on James Earl Ray

DDO Memorandum for DCI dated 23 October 1975

Subject:

Background for Rather Interview -

James Earl Ray

Dick Ober (then in CI) who wrote all the early Ray cables,

recalls that he had numerous discussions with the FBI on the

matter, and is certain that whatever we did was undertaken at

the request of the FBI. Because of the fast moving situation,

most of his discussions with the FBI were on the phone, and

not the subject of written memoranda.

The paper clipped

outgoing cable in referring to Eric Galt (the man initially

identified by the FBI as the assassin of Dr. King) requests

"addressees make every effort determine if Galt is or has

been in your area. Information para one should be passed

to liaison and any other likely sources. FBI requests that

any information reported be evaluated as to reliability and

that as much detail as possible be provided. Cable any

positive reply priority to HQS. and pass to legal attache

if any in your country."

There is a scribbled note in the

file, presumably in Ober's hand, which reads:

"4. Ray

fingerprints; FBI agreed to my proposal we send to field

for liaison.

Ober, also logically points out that the FBI

would not have provided us later with a fingerprint formula

(see attached cable), a detailed physical description and

photos unless they wanted this passed on to overseas liaison

services. Note that our cables did not go, for example, to

SHK
