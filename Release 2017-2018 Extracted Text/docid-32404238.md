We have very much appreciated the fine working relationship that has developed

between your staff and the Review Board and staff. As near as I can tell, the process is

working as it should with significant communication back and forth as we work

together to make available to the American public as many assassination records as

possible.

Thank you for your fine work. We appreciate it very much.
