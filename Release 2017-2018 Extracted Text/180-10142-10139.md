the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later

did graduate work at Berkley in California and at the

University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married

to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of

Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals.

When

Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple

separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also

named Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early

life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity

about her native land and had a reputation for being one

if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena

was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of

Mexican life and made an important contribution to its

artistic development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El' Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.

Ms. Garro's

short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores. The literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, "a

Elena Garro, there is no frontier between reality and

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI) • Because Ms. Garro

poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms

with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders. from all

over the country. (ibid)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political

connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-

attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been

friendly with Embassy officers.

Her broad range of signifi-

cant personal friends, the views of many important to the

American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target. Through-

out the early

1960's she was carried as a target in the

Embassy's Youth Program.

with him.

He was apparently quite smitten with the

daughter and tried to call her on several occasions after

were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran party,

few of whom he knew. He recalled having met a Mexican girl

who had recently returned from living in France. He was

unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it was

probably early in September because of a heavy rain which

occurred as they were leaving the party about 2:00 a.m.

(IBID. p. 4)

Lavagnini noted no Americans present at this party.

He was familiar with the appearance of Lee Harvey Oswald

because of publicity following the assassination of President

Kennedy but otherwise had no knowledge of him and had never

seen him except for news photographs following the assassina

forwarded

On February 3, 1966 Anne Goodpasture sent Thomas' December 25,1945

memo

to the Cuban section with an attached note asking

them to check whether Elena was "seen creating such a

disturbance as they claimed in front of the Cuban

Embassy." (Note from Ann Goodpasture to "Cubans",

2/3/66, CIA No. 579; WX-7241, Entry 428, P. 94, CIA #721.)

One Cuban section officer responded, "No bells

ring with me." Another one wrote "Me neither." The

third officer wrote "No pictures either." (IBID.) There

is no indication that the penetration agents in the Cuban

Embassy were queried about this.

Elena's allegation

(IBID; That there are

no pictures is reasonable since Elena claimed that the

event happened: 1.)

on a Saturday at 3:00 p.m. when

the Cuban Embassy was not normally photographically

surveilled; and

2.) the "disturbance" occured inside the

Cuban compound. HSCA Examination of the CIA Cuban Embassy

photographic surveillance showed no surveillance on 11/23/63.

EJL First Draft

House Select Committee on Assassination

Investigation of Elena Garro's Allegations

The House Select Committee on Assassinations

investigated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews

and personal interviews. The Committee requested and

reviewed the CIA's, FBI's and State DepartmentsFiles, when

avarable

Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp,

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia Duran,

Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio Azcue,

and Emilio Carballido. Only the Elena Garro de Paz file

contained information

on her allegations. Though all the

names

listed above played a role in Elena Garro de Paz'

story, not one of their files included a reference to

Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore,

the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence

Agency'

and

files.

Once again not one of the files included

'mention of Elena Garro's allegations.

Committee on Assassinations learned that
