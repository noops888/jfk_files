MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WED

SUBJECT

Material for possible Use In Discussion with Mr. Pawley

I. The following are excerpts from a memorendun of conversation between

and Jack Gillespie, dated 16 December 1959:

Francisco G. CAVIGAS told GILLESPIE on 15 December that William

PAWLEY. was back in Washington; that Generalissimo TRUJILLO had told

him (CAJIGAS) that PAWLEY had promised that he would have information

on the U. S. official position on the Cuban matter within three days;

that an important person from the Dominican Republic would go to the

United States on 15 December to meet with PAWLEY on 15 to 16 December:

and that he (TRUJILLO) would hold the PEDRAZA forces until the United

States? position was known. On 16 December GILLESPIE said that he

had received a call from Emilio NUNEZ Portuondo the night before and

NUNEZ sald he had just seen PAWLEY, after the latter had dined with

Vice President NIXON. According to NUNEZ, PAVLEY claimed that he

was to meet with the DCI at 0900 on 16 December. NUNEZ also said

that TRUJITIO would not allow the revolutionary army to leave the

Dominican Republic without the approval of the United States Goverment

Comment: NUNEZ, CAJICAS, and GILLESPIE are known to dislike

and/or distrust PAWLEY. PAWLEY's recent break with NUNEZ is well

known. CAJIGAS says he fears and dislikes PAWLEY because of some

earlier transactions in Cuba In which both were involved; he fears

PAWLEY's support of TRUJILLO which might Involve some future commit

ments; and considers PAWLEY "a meddler" who does more harm than good

to the Cuban cause. GILLESPIE has expressed personal distrust of

PAWLEY and said he had discussed PAWLEY with H. Graham Morison, former

Assistant Attorney General now a prominent Washington attorney; MORISON

spoke adversely of PAWLEY, whom he characterized as a great opportunist.

GILLESPIE considers CAJIGAS & "great gentlemen" and has urged that

someone in CIA talk to him.

Bernard REICHHARDI 1s also favorably

one of the most objective

Recently the FBI reported (the DIF Is being circulated and is not

readily available) that PAWLEY had

been meeting with several Cuban exiles

Mayflower Hotel and on leaving the meeting he told them he was going to meet

"with Allen Dulles and Richard Nixon.

This DEF also said that

PAWLEY had been known to compare TRUJILJO with Abraham Lincoln.
