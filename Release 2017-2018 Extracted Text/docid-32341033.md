At 1:30 p.m., 9/17/66, Norman W. Philcox, Legal Attache,

Paris, telephonically contacted Special Agent F. Anthony Tansey,

Duty Supervisor, Domestic Intelligence Division.

Philcox desired

a check of Bureau files and Identification records concerning

above-captioned individuals since the French Police had received

a message from the police at Milan; Italy, indicating that Milan

Police were alerted by American authorities (not otherwise indicated)

that Santiago was "suspected" of being involved in a large-scale

10

holdup in New York City. The holdup possibly involved Stock

Certificates.

Santiago

arrived by air in Paris on 7/16/66 and

and was picked up and searched by the French Police at the airport at

Paris.

He did not appear to have unusual or stolen property in

his possession, but he did have in his possession a rubber stamp

containing the

words "Signature guaranteed by Franklin National

Bank, Madison Avenue, New York City."

The French Police determined

Santiago is a U.S. citizen

traveling with a U.S. Passport.

He was born 2/9/29, New York City,

and has a current residence address at 14850 South Spur Drive,

Miami, Florida.

released, he was observed to be in contact with an individual

later identified as Samuel F. Benton, born 7/4/20, in Poland,

Legal Attache Philcox advised that the French Police had picked

up Benton and were keeping him and that they also had retained

Santiago's passport when Santiago was released.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE:

EXPEDITO FELIX ROBERT SANTIAGO;

SAMUEL. F. BENTON

Philcox stated he would check with Legal Attache

Joseph Leo, Rome, Italy, to determine additional details as

to why the Milan Police thought Santiago is wanted by American

authorities.

Philcox requested a check of Bureau indices and

Identification files and possibly a check with the New York

and Miami offices to determine whether either subject is wanted

by

local authorities or the Bureau.

He specifically requested that

the night supervisor advise him (Philcox) on Monday morning

9/19/66 at 8 a.m. Paris time (3 a.m. Washington, D. C., time)

as to whether or not either subject is wanted so that he would

be able to make this information available to the French Police.

prior to the time Santiago is scheduled to pick up his Passport.

(e)

CHECK OF IDENTIFICATION DIVISION FILES:

Identification Division files indicate an individual

with the same date and place of birth as Santiago was arrested

b the Miami, Florida, Police Department on 10/21/65 on two counts

of assault and battery.. No disposition was shown! Since this

was the only set of prints received on Santiago by the Bureau,.

does not have an FBI number.

her)

Identification Division files indicate an individual

possibly identical with Benton who was born 7/4/16 in Poland,

was arrested on 6/25/39 in Panama by the Canal Zone Police and

charged with violation of immigration regulations as a stowaway

and his sentence was suspended. Since this was the only arrest

indicated, Benton does not have an FBI number. :.

At 4:55 p.m.,

9/17/66, Special Agent Russell S. Garner,

Duty Supervisor, Domestic Intelligence Division, telephonically

contacted Special Agent Boyd Henry of the New York Office and

instructed that New York submit a teletype by 2:00 p.m., 9/18/66

advising whether Santiago or Benton were wanted

by

• the New York

Police Department or by the New York Office. At 5:05 p.m.,

9/17/66, Special Agent Eugene A. Flynn was given similar instruc-

tions as to whether Santiago or Benton were wanted by the Miami

Police Department or the Miami Office of the FBI.
