CONCERN. TO THIS STATION, BUT AT SAME TIME, IT CONFIRMS THE WORST

FEARS EXPRESSEO IN REF & CONCERNING REVELATIONS ABOUT OPERATIONS

AGAINST THE SOVIET TARGET IN MEXICO CITY.

BE DAMAGING TO U.S. SECURITY INTERESTS AND THIS AGENCY IN THE

FOLLOWING MANNER:

A.

REVELATION OF SOURCES.

THE STATEMENT BY BACH IN

REF C

THAT HE "HAD NOT IDENTIFIED ANY SOURCES BY NAME OR DES-

CRIPTION THROUGHOUT THE TAPING..." IS REFUTED BY THE STATEMENT

THAT A SOVIET NAS RECRUITEO BY FORNER COS (ROGER TO KINGMAN)

DURING HIS TOURA

APART FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCUM

STANCES UNDER WHICH THE HECRUITMENT WAS MADE, THE SIMPLE STATE-

MENT THAT A SOVIET OFFICIAL WAS RECRUITED IS SUFFICIENT TO

SET OFF A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION BY THE KGB INTO EVERY

SOVIET OFFICIAL WHO SERVED IN MEXICO CITY DURING THAT TIME

FRAME. THE SOVIETS MAVE THE RESOURCES AND DETERMINATION TO

EVENTUALLY IDENTIFY THE SPY.

B. FUTURE RECRUITMENTS.

HOA WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR

THIS AGENCY TO RECRUIT SOVIETS, OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER, IF

THE AGENCY CANADS OFFER GUARANTEES THAT THE IDENTITY OF SOURCES

MILL NOT DE EXFOSED MY SONE EMPLOYEE, REGARDLESS OF.

MOTIVATION?
