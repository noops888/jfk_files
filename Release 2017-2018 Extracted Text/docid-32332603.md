A Pittsburgh informant has observed LA ROCCA driving a 1961

of the residence of JOSEPH SICA, known Pittsburgh racketeer

who resides at 1003 Lincoln Highway, East McKeesport, Pa.

by the aforementioned informant.

to MARY S. LA ROCCA, 900 West Ingomar Street, Pittsburgh 37,

PG 92-226

was approached by MIKE GENOVESE, protege of LA ROCCA, to

extend credit to FONTANA and assist him in getting started.

The informant knows that about $7,000 worth of merchandise

has been sold to FONTANA already but does not know whether

the LA ROCCA-GENOVESE organization is financially interested

in this legitimate business enterprise or not.

CTE of the Pittsburgh Division has advised that the MANNARINO

organization is in serious financial trouble and is trying

to raise money to hire a top attorney to represent the

organization in the trial involving the Internal Revenue

Service

,at Pittsburgh.

Attempts to hire BENNETT WILLIAMS

have been unsuccessful because of lack of ready money and

this informant has advised that MANNARINO requested the

assistance of LA ROCCA in this matter.

LA ROCCA allegedly

told MANNARINO that he should take care of his own house.

SUBJECT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
