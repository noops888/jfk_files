Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

*.:

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK)

consisted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile

surveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT)

a placed by an emplayee of the local

telephone company who

handled by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped

wa.

united only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

• assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA): LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the

street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

jate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

Othe Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operati

onewas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-.

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips: LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed

on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest. left the gate of the Soviet Embassy.

These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral

as unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were winbratest, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.

There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the lefter listening

post for the telephone numbers of

the soviet, cuban satellite Ea

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners, and cars with

foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post operators

from a tap of the Soviet line... It was picked up and taken to Mr. Boris

This

base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man"

was

to the

public by

the Warren Commission. The photo operators

were moved to another apt

nearby. The property vas sold (under an operational

agreetent with LIMOUSDE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

as IIITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican fazilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

IILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South shielbs the Soviet E-bassy compound

which the lexico Station purchased gang

about 1958 (check date), also using

LOUIe as the jurchager lefieck). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet inbassy couppund. The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

Ramon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elerentary level at

of the lexican services at that tire. The lexican DES (Direction of Federal

Security) with which ve dealt was a hip pocket group run out of the dinistry

Of Gov raent.

This ilnistry spent a major part of its time on control of

foreigners and colitical investigations. Their ajents tiere vicious, venal,

corrupt extortionists. Robert elberg established contact with one of them irgi

Levine De Leon (later LIFIRE group) in about 1950 or 51.

He gave them some

information vas developed but it could not be, defended upon. l'elberg was

replaced by Phil foettinger (resignedrand remained in lexico), lahoney, Thomas

Hazlitt, and Robert Feldman ene Ate T Echir )

During 1958, i Scott met socially some of the chronies of the

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez Fateos.

During this period, the U.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunisn".

One of these seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (ir. son of former l'exi President), acting

for Losez lateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

project (LIENVOY) went through about four distressing years

of a shakedown.

The Mexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, ard greedy. His

son (LIEIVOY-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption. LIELEGAIT also

manipulated control over the principal agent of LIBIGHT mail intercept. The

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected.

However,

as I recail, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish,

and 1 lugoslav line. The baserouse listening post had

a live

nonitor to made short sunnaries of interesting conversations for a caily

resume which was received each day around 8 a.t. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9.a..) Later (when the reel was

completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which rad

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went

the listening

post the day after the transcript (of otker conversations.on the reel)was

typed.

These reels were taken to another location thera

they were translated

and espade In the case af the RuBle it tone, Porka TarasoRS Lealy ran

about a week

boried the date a a ere don bace of the rolasa of

Russian conversations an

he-embers of the Soviet Fubassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the

Soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris.

Herbert Manell and his wife Berbera

handled all of the processi: g of Soviet transcripts. My job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an Americen. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three tines a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later ve got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operetors, cleared the camera each day wretcer there was annings a full

roll of film exposed.

error did occur but generally the agents were conscientious. The Cuban

embassy coverage had nore sophisticated equipient (a pulse ca:era) but it

frequently developed rechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnardi and

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorna l'acilay screeted

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Osvald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked u; and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay vas caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript.. There were no copies of

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

City) without

asking Washington.

Yet accordingly this mar

and said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Soviet doesn't know what to do

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for

the Consul.

He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet)

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat "KALONIA"', and needed routine visa information, Firs

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned outsto be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

making a call

to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

he Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN)

who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more,

advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number)

and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number

is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the khite

House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

FBI have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing ussful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition rould not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand thia list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

sincerely yours,

And

Hugh S. Cunning, JI.

We weren't given

with regard to E - Mrs., Paine, etc., we are working on that.

between him and the Embassy up there.

The wife is being interrogated. I don't now if that took place yesterds

or is still going on. You are getting a teletyye answer on that. I am

just giving you a previer.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's, allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Embassy on 18 September, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the ISth of Segtember. There 1s

record showing entry into Mexico on Septenber 26. On about the 15th be

applied in New Orleans for a tourist card.

We do know he was in -

I may even have sone later Informätion which came in during the nigat -

As you know, he was in lem arleans

the, 25th when the family left.

Bi. O'teal: He left there the

day

; He was seen on the,

25t

and the landlady said he slipped during the night.

He was last seen by the landlady

ben.

Now we have immigration records snowing him

entering Mexico on the 26th which

very strongly suggests

that he was not in Mexico

on the l8th.

What we are trying to

find out is where he

was every single day -

the 25th, 24th, and all the way back.

Silvia DURAN calls the USSR Embassy and talks to an unidentified

Soviet. She says that in the Cuban Embassy there is a North

American who was at the soviet Embassy. The Soviet says wait a

minute. Silvia DURAN speaks English with someone - and comments

in Spanish that they gave APARICIO telephone 14-12-99 and to take

the number down - Silvia DURAN then says the American citizen

is

going to talk with you, i.e., the Soviet. The American first

speaks Russian and the Soviet speaks English. They continue in

English. The American talks broken Russian and says I was in

your Embassy and spoke to your Consul. Just a minute. A Soviet

takes the phone and asks the American in English what does he want?

The American says please speak Russian. The Russian says what else

do you want? The American says I was just now at your Embassy and

they took my address. The Soviet says I know that. The American,

in hardly recognizable Russian, says I did not know it then. I

went to the Cuban Embassy to ask them for my address, because they

have it. The Soviet says why don't you come again and leave your

address with us, it is not far from the Cuban Embassy. The Ameri-

can says I'll be there right away.
