By letter dated December 1, 1975, A. Gearle Field, Staff

Director of the above-captioned Committee, asked the Department for

details regarding the FBI's undercover proprietary operation in the

greater Baltimore area.

On January G, 1976, Deputy Associate Director James B.

Adams and Deputy Assistant Director Trederick C. Fehl of the FBI

met with you and explained why complying with this request might

seriously jeopardize the lives of our Agents assigned to undercover

investigations in the field of organized crime.

Inasmuch as it has been decided that information in connection

with this particular operation must be made available to the Committee,

I have instructed that this operation be suspended until we know how

much additional information will be demanded and whether or not the

disclosure of the intormation will jeopardize the operation.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memorandum 12X36) 75

reported intention of House Select Committee on Intelligende

(HSC) to take depositions from former FBI Special Agents (SAs)

Joseph William Magee and Joseph leo Gormley concerning

U. S. Recording Company purchases made by the FBI.

Pursuant to Recommendations 2 and 3 of the above-

referred-to memorandum, addresses and telephone numbers were

obtained from the personnel files and furnished to Supervisor

P. V. Daly of the Legal Counsel Division on the morning of

1/2/76 so that he might orally advise the HSC of the current

whereabouts of Magee and Gormley. Prior to furnishing of

information to Daly, Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the

Senstudy 75 Project

had telephone conversations with both

Magee and Gormley, also on the morning of 1/2/76, for the

purpose of alerting them to the HSC interest and with the

suggestion that, if they are contacted, they might call the

Legal Counsel Division for further assistance. Both indicated

that they would take such action and expressed appreciation

I for being alerted in advance. In addition, Magee advised of

certain information which is being recorded hereinafter for

information purposes.

ST. 115:

REC-5T,

62-111444-258

Magee advised that on a friday, about 1/10/19, ne

was telephonically contacted by a Mike Epstein of the Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence (SSC) who indicated a desire

to talk to him immediately. Magee told Epstein that he was

quite busy and would not be able to see him immediately.

The only information Epstein gave as to the reason for

wanting to interview Magee was to get information about the

early organization of the FBI Laboratory. There followed

some further telephone calls between the two but they never

got together for an interview at that time. However,

Epstein again called Magee early during the week of 12/28/75

and asked Magee to

appear for interview Tuesday, 1/6/76.

The only information Epstein gave as to the subject matter

of the interview was that it would be about the operations

of the Bureau. Magee agreed to appearing for the interview.

It was explained to Magee that the same procedure

relative to an SSC interview would apply as that for one of

the HSC, and it was suggested that immediately after completing

the conversation with Phillips, Magee telephone the Legal

Counsel Division for further information, particularly as

to waiver of the confidentiality agreement he has with the

Bureau.

Magee said that he would immediately call

Mr. Mintz' office:

As a matter of interest, Magee also advised that,

"when he was first contacted by Epstein September last, he

asked Epstein where the latter had gotten his name and

Epstein said it was from Bill Sullivan..

Magee then told

Phillips that he could just not understand some of the things

which he has been learning about Sullivan and he expressed

dismay at some publicized reports that Sullivan had been

making statements derogatory to the Bureau and the late

Mr. Hoover. Magee said that at the time former Acting

Director I. Patrick Gray left the Bureau, and before

Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus was named to succeed him,

Sullivan contacted Magee. Sullivan told Magee that he,

Sullivan, fully intended to become FBI Director and that,

if he did, he wanted Magee to return to

Magee's remarks was that he thought Sullivan was talking

rather wildly in making such a job offer to him and that

this applied as well to the idea of Sullivan becoming FBI

with the House Select Committee and of his request to have Bryan Gettings

designated as counsel. Mr. Martin said that he would confer with

certain that Vir. Gettings could be designated to assist Mr. Mohr in this
