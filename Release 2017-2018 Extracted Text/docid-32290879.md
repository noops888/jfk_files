In order to afford visual as well as technical

coverage of the residence of JOSEPH RAYMOND DIEZ, 4951

past to obtain the rental of

a rental property at 4603

Hills Drive, Tampa, which is owned by I

PCI of Tampa Office.

However, the property on River Hills

Drive has been rented and unavailable to the Tampa Office.

OTHER 1B, 4

+.

Hills Drive is now available and he would be willing

to rent it to the Bureau on a monthly basis at the rate of

$115.00 a month, which would include water, electricity, heat

and furnishings.

It was pointed out to him that the Tampa

Office, should the property be needed, might wish to dis-

continue it after a month, and he advised that this would be

satisfactory to him and any period beyond one month would be

payable on a weekly basis.

provide fifty gallons of fuel for the beating unit, which

should be more than enough to last for a period of seven to

eight weeks.

In this regard, he said that should additional

heat be needed, the Tampa Office could pay for additional fuel

oil; however, there would be little likelihood of needing

further heat.
