17. Remarks (By SAC):

It is recommended that this surveillance be maintained for an

additional period of

ninety days and such will be done UACB.

There can be no doubt that the general quality and quantity of

information obtained through this source has greatly decreased

since its peak three years ago.. However, this source does continue

to be active to some extent as

can be seen through the information

set out under number 9. In addition, attention is drawn to the

fact that no expense'is involved in monitoring this source due to

the fact that the same employees who monitor other surveillances

on the same subject conveniently and with only nominal' additional

effort monitor this source. 'In addition, it should be clearly

understood that there does

,not, appear to be any particular risk.

involving the security of this source, the only risk being that

which would be inherent in making an entry to retrieve thé

microphone.
