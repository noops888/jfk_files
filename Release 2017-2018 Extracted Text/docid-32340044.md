"SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

May 28, 1969

Attached airtel advises that DeWitt Coffman

requested Miami Office to furnish "FBI clearance" on

Michael McLaney who was being considered for the posi-

tion of manager of a new hotel and gambling casino in

Haiti being built by Coffman's associates.

When

intormed the FBI does not furnish "clearances" on any-

none and was unable to comment concerning Mc Laney,

Mr. Coffman stated he was a friend of Mr. Tolson's

and perhaps he would contact Mr. Tolson for information

Habout Mc Laney.

Bureau files show Mr. Coffman knew the

Director and Mr. Tolson when he was formerly employed |

at the Mayflower Hotel, Washington, D. C.

He was also

Vice President and General Manager of Schine Hotels in

Miami,

Florida, in 1958. Mr. G. David Schine, who

is on the Special Correspondents' List, at that time was

! President and General Manager of the Schine Hotels.

Mc Laney, born 2-1-15 in New Orleans, Louisiana,

has a long reputation of being an inveterate gambler and

associate of high-stakes bettors.

He was part-owner and

operator of the casino in the Hotel Nacional; Havana,

Cuba, in 1959, when members of the Meyer Lansky group

had an interest in it.

From 6/4/65 to 3/7/67, he was an

approved Top Echelon criminal informant and provided

valuable information about hoodlums and gamblers. He

was discontinued when he became involved in political

activities in the Bahamas. The Commission of Inquiry,

Bahamas, in 1967, severely criticized Mc Laney for his

efforts to buy Premier Lynden Pindling and become head

of gambling enterprises in the Bahamas.
