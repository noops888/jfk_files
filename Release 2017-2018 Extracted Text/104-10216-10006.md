MEMORANDUM:

SUBJECT:

Proposal to Exploit AMLASH-1 and

Jose Rebellon in ANSNEAK Operation

It is proposed that at the next meeting with

UNSNAFU-25 we pass a message as follows:

opened a numbered (secret) account in

Switzerland through, Colombian Suarez (my

successor). He was traveling in Europe at

that time, roughly December 1964-January 1965.

The deposit was in the amount of $10,000."

The message is purposely so phrased that it could apply to

both AMLASH-1 and Jose Rebellon.

Both are past presidents

of the FEU (Federation of University Students), one is a

comandante and the other a captain, and both were traveling.

in Europe in December 1964-January

Subject proposal has taken the following information

into consideration.

AMLASH-1

The record: The file shows that since

April 1959 and repeatedly since then AMLASH-]

has threatened to eliminate AMTHUG-1, but has

not done so.

He also was reportedly on the

verge several times of defecting but never did.

There are numerous reports of varying credibility.

that he has been and

is a Castro agent.

His

character is such that he has been described

in a report as "a probable thief, a possible

user of narcotics, a homosexual or a friend of

homosexuals," but

also "an exceedingly brave

man."

Various reports indicate that he is a

• heavy drinker and a party lover.

Thus a person

with such traits could resonably be believed

to be involved in irregular financial transactions.

b.

Favorable factors (from ANSNEAK

standpoint):

In the summer of 1962 AMLASH-1

gave ANWHIP-1 $500 in Helsinki to be deposited

for AMLASH-1 in a European bank "for a rainy

day."

In March 1961 ANLASH-] showed great

sensitivity on the subject of bank accounts

in Europe by Cuban officials, indicating that

he might shoot any official so involved.

C.

Conclusion: While it cannot be

discounted that AMLASH-1 may be a Castro

agent, it may be that he has been sincere

In his dealings with KUBARK. Resolution of

doubts through an LCFLUTTER interview has

been impossible since AMLASH-1 hit the

ceiling when the matter was first mentioned.

Presumably

•KUBARK's interest in

AMLASH-1 is to see him carry out his mission

to eliminate AMTHUG-1. The above proposal

may actually stimulate the desired

action.

If AMLASH-1 is questioned by the regime in

connection with this charge, and should the

investigation involve a certain amount of

harassment and unpleasantness, he might well

reach the conclusion that the

time to take

matters into his own hands (which he has

threatened to do for several years) has at

last arrived.

If AMLASH-] is a Castro agent and

Castro should be aware of AMLASH-l's relation-

Ship with KUBARK, Castro might conclude that

ANLASH-I received the money from KUBARK,

banked it without reporting it, and was

in

fact working with KUBARK against Castro.

(At the recent meetings in Paris AMLASH-]

asked us for $10,000.

We did not give him

this sum, though AMWHIP-1 gave him $7,000.)

If for any reason the regime should

his alleged sympathizers

in the Armed Forces might feel they must react

at once to save their own skins. Given the

tense political situation in Cuba today, this

is not out of the question and certainly this

-proposal could split the regime more.

Jose Rebellon

Rebellon is a non-controversial good

target for inclusion in this ANSNEAK play for

the following reasons:

b.

He is familiar with the $80,000

account opened in a

Swiss bank by Ambassador

Carrillo in the fall of 1964. Rebellon has

been authorized by Castro to draw on that

fund for purchases related to Castro's pet

projects.

Castro might think that Rebellon

had raided Castro's own official fund.

As with AMLASH-1, any action by the

regime against Rebellon might widen splits in

Cuba and bring about further political

uneasiness

and tensions in interpersonal relationships that

we desire.
