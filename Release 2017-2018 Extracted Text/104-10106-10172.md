GE MEMORANDUM FOR- THE RECORD:

Meeting With PDLADLE and Bernard Ex-Maneure as

December 1977

Latiouri

28E7324

1.

Subject meeting was held in New York City at

the home of MONCURE on 7 December 1977, and attended

by PDLADLE, MONCURE,

Vascia Gmirkin and

Terrell Hutchison.

2. Financially, there were the following objectives:

a. To apprise PDLADLE that

no more loans could

be made.

b. To convince PDLADLE that the New York City

rental property should be retained.

c. To obtain a deed of trust on the property.

3. MONCURE began the discussions with an outline to

PDLADLE of the present administration's position on grant-

ing additional loans, i.e., that no more. loans could be

made.

He briefly touched on the subject of retaining

the New York City property. PLADLE repeated his previ-

ously

stated position that the property be sold.

4. After lengthy discussion of PDLADLE's financial

position and the financial demands of his wife, we pre-

sented PDLADLE with "financial position" figures reflecting

his general. income of four (4) years ago compared with 1977.

Without going into details of the discussions, the

follow-

ing

actions were agreed on by PDLADLE:

. a.

Except for one further loan of approximately

$10,000 to pay off a bank mortgage on the

New York city property, no more loans will

be made by the Agency. Note: It is necess-

ary that we advance this payment in order to

obtain a first trust on the property.

b. Concurrent with the advance of about $10,000

noted above, PDLADLE will execute a Deed of

• Trust to the Agency (mortgagee to be determined)

for the present loan balance of $158,350, plus

the amount required to pay off the bank (approxi-

mately $10÷000). The Agency mortgage would then

be approximately $168,000. This action was

deemed prudent because POLADLE, having signed

only promissory notes on the loans, could in

fact sell the property at any time without

making any payments to the Agency.

.C..

To relieve any adamantine attitude by

PLADLE when he was advised to the no

more loan policy, POLADLE was apprised

…that we recognize that his "retainer" has

not been increased for several years, and

to keep abreast with inflation, we proposed

increasing this by $4,800 per year, i.e.,

from $19,200 to $24,000. This step, aside

from "softening up" LADLE to "no more loans"

and: a first trust on the property, was also

designed to place him in a rather firm financial

position in hopes of "solving" his financial pro-

blems once and for all. LADLE was, of course,

pleased with this increase; and maybe being a

little sharper financially than we have given

him credit for, wanted to know if this 1978

increase of $4,800 could in fact be paid in

a lump sum in January. Fearful that he would

give this money to his wife for her impending

trip to Spain, he was advised that we could

arrange this payment providing it was only

used to liquidate the Ed Card loan on the farm.

This payment along with about $3,000 which

MONCURE has in the PDLADLE bank account would ca

7352

Just about liquidate the Ed Card loan.

d. In eliminating the bank loan on the

New York City property and the Ed Card loan

on the farm, LADLE's only recurring monthly

obligations, will be the taxes on his pro-

perties and the $1,000 to his wife.

5. MONCURE pointed out that the recording fee

. on

a mortgage is $1.25/$100; therefore, the fee on a $170.00

would be about $2,125. Since we are insisting on

the

mortgage, the Agency should absorb this charge, as well

as any other nominal charges so related.

6.

Herewith a summary of the payments that we should

expect to pay in early 1978:

a. Advance (loan) to pay off bank loan -

About:

b. Prepayment of retainer increase - referred

to in para 4.c.

$10,000

$ 4,800

c. Recording fees for mortgage

d. LADLE's regular "salary" for

January thru March - 3 x $1,600

Total:

$ 2,200

$ 4,800

7. It should be noted that the above advance (loan) .

of $10,000 is presently provided for in the 1978 OPACT, which

in fact provides for "loans" of $20,000. The "salary" increase

of $4,800 can likewise be absorbed from this $20,000.

8.

As MONCURE is going into a hospital on 9 December

for an operation and with the holiday season shortly there-

after, it was proposed that we attempt to finalize these

transactions on 11 January 1978. This will give MONCURE

an opportunity to

advise the bank of the intent to pay off

the loan, and to obtain and record the lst trust on the pro-

perty.

9. In recognition that the legal involvement should go

beyond MONCURE, a copy of this memo is being sent to the OGe

for their assistance in providing the name of the "mortgaga"

to"be used on the mortgage, presumably a cleared New York

City legal firm, who could also coordinate with MONCURE on

the

preparation

and

recording of the mortgage.
