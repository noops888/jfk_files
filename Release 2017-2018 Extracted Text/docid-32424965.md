MESSAGE

DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY

STAFF COMMUNICATIONS OFFA

addresseesonly from Taylor.

THIS IS A WARNING MESSAGE.

2. The President of the United States has under

consideration the initiation of blockade operations

against Cuba.

2. The reaction to these operations by Cuban military

forces could lead to U.S. air strikes against Cuban armed

forces, and invasion of the island of Cuba. Preparations

for these contingencies are in progress.

These sub-

sequent actions, if initiated, would probably result in

the use of force against Soviet military and civilian

personnel in Cuba and would directly challenge the

prestige of the Soviet Union. The reaction of the USSR

cannot

be predicted with accuracy.

3. It is imperative under the circumstances which

could arise to present the strongest possible deterrent

to any course of Soviet military action. The U.S.

must demonstrate unequivocally that it is ready

militarily to meet and to defeat retallatory soviet

actions at whatever level is necessary. At the same

time, we must avoid actions in other areas which may

be considered provocative or which may create civil

alarm.
