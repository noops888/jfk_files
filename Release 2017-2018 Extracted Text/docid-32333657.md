democratic forces over the Cuban Conmunist regime. This plan is

based on our historical struggle for freedom.

After an exhaus-

tive study, the following facts were revealed:

It is useless to demand aid fron the United States be-

cause the US policy on the Cuban situation is not cooperative.

We must decide not to leave the liberation of Cuba in the hands

of foreigners since it is more our duty to liberate Cuba than

We have to take action in order to see Cuba liberated

because the Communist regime will never be overthrown by internal

revolt. The decision open to cubans has two alternatives: the

decision to fight or the decision to submit io losing their !

country. We have chosen the alternative to fight for the ulti-

mate liberation of Cuba, without considering the elements of

time delay or resulting pain fron this'decision.

b. Reports from our clandestine operators in Cuba re-

vealed the conmunist plans for Castro's action in 1963, which

are as follows:

(1) To reach a rapprochement with the US Government

through arbitration of the lexican and Brazilian Governments.

The Castro regime will assure that it will leave the Moscow

orbit as a satellite and will convert cuba into a nationalist

socialist country similar to lugoslavia.

(2) The first phase of the plan was the release of

the Playa Giron prisoners.

The next stage of the plan is to :

offer indemnities for US property and goods that were confis-

cated tiro years ago in Cuba. Payment will be made with sugar.

This plan is under consideration by 'pacifist' elements within

the US Govemment. Castro's plan includes (a) amnesty to 20-

litical prisoners, several of whom have already been released;

and (b) to hold 'elections' at a propitious time, which will

surely constitute a 'fixed election.!

The thesis of AIPHA 66 is to carry out the war of

liberation of Cuba.

d. The plans of ALPHA 66 are:

(I)• ALPHA 66 and the Second National Front of the

Escambray

have joined together with military equipment and the

necessary men to initiate war.

(2) We are preparing to increase the attacks soon

to initiate war on Cuban territory, which will lead to the

rhe damtal) et the Castro regime.

ultimate downfall of the Castro regime.

(3): Even without material assistance from friendly

governments,

the struggle against international communism on

Cuban soil will begin.

(4) Clandestine operators are in place to stage

raids;

sabotage and espionage with the general purpose to pre-

pare the conditions for general insurrections.

(5) The aim of the commando activities is to con-

tinue harrassing the Castro Goverrment, such as the raids on

Caibarien, Isabela de Sagua and Juan Francisco.

The raids are

part of a carefully laid out plan seeking the liberation of cuba.

"Fidel Castro knows of our activities and is aware that

this time the fight is against men dedicated to liberating Cuba

at all costs.

The end is just a matter of time.

We call Cubans

to unite in a struggle without animosities.

Personal differences

must be forgotten.

The

(U) An article printed in the 1? January 1963 edition of

the san Juan, Puerio Rico English Language dally THE SAN JUAN

STAR quoted VECIANA as stating that Eloy GUTIERREZ Menoyo,

leader of the Second Front of the Iscambray organization, had

been making secret visits to Cuba in November and December 1962

organizing underground activities. VECIANA said that resistance

leaders in groups of two and three are being infiltrated into

Cuba.

According to him, GUTIERREZ Menoyo has been stationed at

a secret Caribbean island base of the Escambray group since

October 1962.

VECIANA added that fron this secret base they

have been broadcasting to Cuba every night at 2200 hours and

have been also landing equipment there. Members of the Escam-

bray group, according to VECIANA, have held secret meetings with

about 30 officials of the CASTRO ségime who are ready to join a

resistance movement.

(C) Corments: According to the source of VECIANA's speech,

the information appearing in the speech was received from clan-

destine operators located in Cuba, and was transmitted through

a clandestine communications system available to VECIANA and

OPERATION ALPHA 66.

In the opinion of the confidential source,

VECIANA's statements in his speech, although slightly exaggerated

and embellished, are valid.

'The confidential source is convinced

that OPERATION ALPHA 66 has the resources and capabilities to

carry, out the "action" program of warfare on. Cuban territory out-

Lined in VECIANA's speech.

In a statement dated 8 November 1902, the original

OPERATION ALPHA 66 Members announced VECIANA'S

"resignation"

after his disclosure of his ties with the GUTIERREZ Menoyo group.

Henceforin, the statement added, the group would be known as

"'Comandos I-66" to distinguish themselves from VECIANA who

insisted in using the name of ALPHA 66.
