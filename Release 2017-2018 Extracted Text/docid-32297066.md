On 4/16/65, GEORGE HOPKINS advised that a good 100k-

ing woman about 26 years old, 5'6" or 7" tall, slim build, and

long bleached blond hair has been staying with ROSSELLI for the

past several days and on 4/15/65 she and ROSSELLI moved a lot

aye and on 4225/

of her clothes into ROSSELLI's apartment. HOPKINS will endeavor

to obtain the name of this woman.

On 4/13/65, LA 4145-0 advised that he had learned

from FRANZ BREITLING,

owner of Ajax West Coast Corporation,

Santa Barbara, California, that ROSSELLI recently sold about

26 Kold Draft ice cube machines to some establishment in Las

Vegas, Nevada, and has potential orders for about 100 addi-

tional machines within the next several months.

ROSSELLI

sells ice cube machines and Ajax West Coast Corp. sends the

nachines to the buyer, collects the money, and then sends

ROSSELLI a check forchis profit on the sale.

In this connection,

recent examination of ROSSELLI's bank account at the Fidelity

BoR $525.72 drawn on the Crocker-Anglo National Bank, Santa

Beverly Hills, California, revealed a deposit of a check

Barbara, California. In the past ROSSELLI has received check

from the Ajax West Coast Corp. which were drawn on this bank

and this check was probably a

payment for ROSSELLI's profit

on the

sale of ice cube machines.
