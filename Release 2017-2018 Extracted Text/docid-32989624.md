¡Director Sec'y —

This memorandum records for the record my efforts

to meet with MD. Thomas K. Latimer, Special Assistants to the

Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, on 6/25/75.

On the late afternoon of 7/24/75, Mr. Benson

Buffham, Deputy Director, National Security Agency (NSA),

made available to Liaison Agent Brian Murphy a copy of a

"Top Secret" memorandum dated 4/20/71, written by Louis W.

Tordella, who was the then Deputy Director of NSA. This

Memorandum for the Record, Subject: JFK Act 6 (4)

copy of which

is attached, makes reference to a file entitled JFK Act 6 (4)

available in the office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for

Intelligence, United States Army.

Pursuant to your instructions on the evening of

7/24/75, I personally contacted Mr. Latimer at approximately

8:00 a.m., 7/25/75. In my conversation with Mr. Latimer, I

noted

that it was imperative that I see him as soon as

possible regarding the contents of the JFK Act 6 (4) file.

Mr. Latimer was informed that the Bureau was attempting to

establish the line of authority relative to the Bureau's

procurement of foreign government's cable traffic sent

through international cable companies in the United States.

Mr. Latimer indicated that he hát reta a 4th 2

from Mr. Buffham on the late afternoon of 7/24/75 and was

aware of the Bureau's interest in reviewing certain memoranda

in the JEK Act 6 (4) file. Mr. Latimer indicated that this was

a matter of interest to the General Counsel ef the Department

of Defense and that he would have to consult with them.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

He advised me he would have somebody from the General Counsel's

office, Department of Defense, promptly contact me regarding

a review of this file by FBI personnel.

Not hearing from Mr. Latimer by the late morning

of 7/25/75, I telephonically contacted his office. He was

not available and I asked his secretary to have him return

my call. Shortly before noon, Mr. Latimer returned my call

and explained that he had discussed my request with

Mr. "Marty" Hoffman (phonetic) of the Department of Defense.

It was Latimer's understanding that Mr. Hoffman had gone to

the White House to discuss my request with Mr. Philip Buchen,

Counsel to the President. Latimer promised that he would

telephonically recontact me as soon as he could establish

contact with Hoffman.

l again reiterated to Latimer that it

was imperative the Bureau have access to the JEK Act 6 14) file

in order that we could advise the Attorney General as to

its contents hoping to clearly demonstrate that both the

then Attorney General Thomas Clark and, in fact, President

Truman himself were aware of certain information contained

what was at issue here and that he would get back to me as

soon as possible.

At 1:50 p.m., 7/25/75, I again called Mr. Latimer's

office and his secretary informed me that Mr. Latimer had

stepped out of his office and that she would give him a

message to call me as soon as he returned. As of 4:00 p.M.,

7/25/75, I had not received a return call from Mr. Latimer.

ACTION:

For information and record purposes.

Mr

Buffham and I had an opportunity this morning to read

the

JFK Act 6 (4) file in ACSI. Major General Joe! McChristian gave

us permission to view it but once we had read it, after careful con-

sideration he decided that he would not feel free to give NSA either

the file or a duplicate copy without personal permission from SecDef

inasmuch as SecDef had entrusted the file to ACSI in 1949. All of

us agreed that an approach to the Secretary would be unnecessary

and perhaps would generate too many questions. He did agree

after sealing the file again to limit access to the Secretary of Defense

on demana, the Director or the Deputy Director, NSA, on demand

I hide smile the Chief of the SSO, AlSt. This red le wited a

The file contained memoranda for record, one prepared after

a meeting in Forrestal's office attended by senior officials from ITT,

Western Union, and RCA plus Mark Leva (then Defense General

Counsel), Secretary Forrestal, and a representative from the Attorney

General's office. Colonel Carter Clark from ACSI, who was present,

prepared this memorandum. A subsequent meeting was held in Secre-

tary Louis Johnson's office attended by representatives. of the same

three companies and I believe the Attorney General himself. In Mr.

• Johnson's own handwriting is a note to the effect that he showed the

memorandum for record to President Truman and a note that ICC, ap-

parently Attorney General Thomas Clark, either was present or had

also discussed the matter with the President.

Both memoranda indi-

cated that the companies were informed that the work they were doing

was of very great importance to the U.S. and every effort would be

made to protect knowledge of its existence as well as to protect the

companies in the event of exposure.

The material is filed under TS Control No. 516652-3-5 in the

SSO ACSI files.

D. BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS

In January 1971, the Director approved a request

from the Director, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, to provide covert recruitment and security

clearance support to BNDD. This has been accomplished

through the medium of a proprietary of the Office of

Security

operating in

Falls Church, Virginia. Support

includes covert recruitment, investigation, polygraph,

medical clearance, and training. It has been divided

into three phases:

_operation to place indi-

viduals

• in BNDD field offices to monitor any illegal

activities of other BNDD employees; (2) Recruitment

of Chinese or Spanish speaking covert Agents; and (3)

Recruitment of an individual used as an Agent by BADD

but actually employed by BNdD, although this fact is

known only to the Director and Chief Inspector, BNDD.

In this case, arrangements were made

for all pay and

other employee benefits to come from

on a reim-.

bursable basis.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: General: Office of Security Survey

1. At the Director's instruction, and with the concurrence

of the then DD/P, the Office of Security developed informants in

• RID to report on the activities of RID employees on whom security

questions had arisen. This program, which included upwards of a

dozen informants at its peak, has declined to its present level of

three, only one of whom is reporting regularly on matters of current

interest.

2. The principal object of Security's interest through this

informant is

a female who was employed in RID for a number of years

until she resigned in 1969. Her resignation coincided with the initiation

of a security review on her by the Office of Security, but Security does

not know whether the employee was aware of this security review at

the time of her resignation.

3. Security's interest in this employee was occasioned by

reports that she had developed an increasingly intimate acquaintance

with a Cuban national. Reporting by one informant, who was also

being developed by the Cuban, suggested that the Cuban might have

an intelligence interest in the female. The same informant also sub-

sequently reported that the Cuban had numerous other contacts among

clerical and secretarial employees of the Agency. Among these

employees is one girl who works in a

biographic section in SB Division.

4. Subsequent to her departure from the Agency, the ex-RID

employee entered into a common-law marital relationship with the

Cuban and joined him as partner in a photographic business. In this

capacity she solicited business among CIA employees, especially

those requiring passport photos. Recently, she and the Cuban sought

to employ Security's informant in this business on a part-time basis.

5. Information on the background of the Cuban is fairly extensive,

. but it is inconclusive.

He is known to have been a momber of anti-

Castro organizations

this country. There are al

reports that

his mother was imprisoned in Cuba at one time. Intre are other

episodes in his life that suggest intelligence involvement on his part

with some hostile service, but this is not yet definitely established.

:6. The Office of Security has had at times a second informant

in this case. His reporting has tended to confirm reporting by the

principal informant.

7. There is conclusive evidence that the Cuban expressed

interest in certain 201 files in the Agency, and there are good groundso

for believing that the RID female employee delivered at least one such

•file to the Cuban while she was still in RID. There is also evidence

that the female employee in SB Division has continued in frequent

contact with her friend, the ex-RID employee, and the Cuban. On

one occasion, she served as intermediary for contact instructions

from the Cuban to O/S's principal informant. The informant has no

knowledge, however, of any other requirements that may have been

levied on or satisfied by the SB employee. Neither does he know of

• the extent of contacts by this couple with other Agency employees

except social contacts.

JFK Act 6 (1) (C)

9. It would appear to me that the Office of Security has dallied

with this case long enough. Apparently unable through positive measures

to resolve doubts about the case. O/S has followed the course of watch-

ful waiting, hoping the Cuban would take precipitant action himself that

would give us the evidence we seek. In the meantime, our knowledge

of the relationship between the Cuban and the several other current

Agency employees with whom he is known to have contact continues

-z-

000G3

NH 55108 DocId: 32989624 Page 25

---

## Page 26

to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his girlfriend have made

any further approaches to Security's informant recently, although he

• continues to see them

ocially. Thus, there is slir

reason to believe

that further waiting will produce a break in the case.

10. There are two courses open to the Office of Security now.

It can attempt to have the Agency employees known to be in contact

with the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might

alert the Cuban to our penetration of the operation, particularly

since a plausible reason for transier would be difficult to develop

for some of the persons involved. Alternatively, Security could

move overtly and charge the Agency employees with violation of the

security regulation requiring reporting of contacts with foreign

nationals. This would, of course, terminate the Office of Security's

operation.

11. One of these courses of action should be chosen promptly.

The possibility that the employee in SB Division may be passing

information on

is too great to warrant further

delay in moving against her. Moreover, it is possible that the Cuban

has current productive penctrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage

to the Agency seems clearly to outweigh any. possible gains from

continuing this CI effort.

4. I informed Mr. Krogh that from time to time

in matters involving the national

security the Agency had

detailed to Mr. G. Marvin Gentile, Director of State

security, a polygraph operator and a polygraph machine for

his use in polygraphing state Department employees tno

were recipients of allegations concerning treir lojalty.

I emphasized that this procedure had the Director's

approval and that State clearly understood that the examin-

ation was their total responsibility.

I further informed

him that this was the only way we could undertake to enter-

tain his request and that even then it would require the

• specific approval of the Director. Mr. Krogh asked me to

obtain such approval and work out such arrangements with

Mr. Gentile.

5.

Later that sane day, Mr. Krogh called Mr. Gentile

and inquired as

to whether the

arrangements had been made.

Mr. Gentile indicated

they had and

suggested that the same

polygraph operator be used to examine the Defense suspect.

Mr. Krogh informed vir. Gentile that he considered this an

excellent idea and that he would instruct Defense officials

to make their man available to Mr. Gentile for a polygraph

examination.

6. The four individuals were Iden 182

of the Department of Defense and Iden 183

Iden 184

• and

Iden 185

• of

the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The polygraph

examinations resulted in clearing the four

men and

the

results of the examinations were forwarded over my signature

to MI. Gentile on 29 July 1971. A copy of my covering

memorandum is attached.

7. • Iden 186

a staff writer for The

Washington Post, in an article dated 3 September 1971

stated that a State Department spokesman had acknowledged

at a news briefing that agents of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation had

polygraphed State Department employees

suspected of leaking information on the SALT talks in

July. MI. John Edgar Hoover, then Director of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, denied this allegation in a

letter to The Hashingter Post and said that the polygraph

examinations had bein concucted by another agency. Specu-

lation centered around the Agency, but after a day or so,

press speculation in this regard died avay.

8. Iden 186

apparently has never been satisfied

and has been pressing dr. Charles Bray, State Department

spokesman, for confirmation of Agency involvement.

Bray learned today that Iden 186

plans to use a press

conference to be held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon to press

this point further. Mr. Bray has been given guidance by

Mr. Gentile to avoid confirmation but if this is impossible

he will indicate the examinations

were conducted by State

Department Security officials utilizing an operator and

a machine detailed to the Department for this purpose. I

do not know whether or not the fact that the government-wide

investigation las directed by MI. Egil Krogh is known to

Iden 186

but I suspect that it is and that this is the

reason why the matter has been

raised again. Mr. David

Young was instrumental in pushing my office to conduct an

internal Agency investigation of this disclosure and the

White House was satisfied that no Agency employee was

the source.

office of the President such

as the Councii on International

Economic Policy and

the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board.

We

have furnished secretarics, clerical

employees and certain professional employees on a reimbursable

and non-reimbursable basis.

At the present time, ve

have no

clericals or professionals assigned to the immediate White

House office, but we do have one young man detailed to their

Communications Section. There are detailees to PFIAB and CIEP.

I might point out that we had

detailed to the White House as

late as

the

fall of 1970 couriers,

telephone operators,

laborer

assigned to the grounds and a graphics

man who

to the Secretary of

he Treasury along with

at other Agency

employees.

We have even,

in rare. instances, detailed our

people to Congressional Staffs for short periods of time.

3. Details to the White House and Government Agencies -

Discussion: Details to iSC, the white House, isA and the

National far College are probably quite defersible. On the other

hand, there may be those who would question Agency employees

currently workirg at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs

and Mr.

Peter Peterson having an Agency employee as his

secretary when he was the Secretary of Cormerce (she also made

a trip with him to Moscow).

She is still with him in his

present assignment but we

expect that she will redort to NSC for

a new detail sometime this month. Iden 112

served for

years as Director of the Office of Public Safety for

AID. This information has been kept "close to the vest" during

that entire period of time. He has been approved for disability

retirement and is presently on sick leave and will retire

automatically at the expiration of this leave.

Each detail of an Agency employee to the White House or

other Government agency has been carefully considered and

approval

at a higher level obtained when professionals were

involved.

4. Project TWOFOLD: I believe the support we are

providing to Project TrOFOLD is an activity that should be .

reported under your guidelines.

Since this is an extremely

sensitive Project and the Office of Security is reporting on

it, I will not repeat the details in my memorandum.

5.

Individuals Engaged in Domestic Activities: In a more

general sense, Contract Personnci Division prepares and executes

contracts with individuals engaged by the Agency to carry out

domestic activities. He also process Staff Agents who are

domestically assigned. None of these assignments are decided

in OP. I really have no way of knowing with any degree of

certainty what the specific duties of these individuals will be.

from Howard Hunt for a lockpicker who might be retiring or

Executive Fellowship. - The book is entitled "Where's

What -- Sources of Infornation for Federal Investigators."

It is a full treatise on the existence of sources of in-

formation that may be useful to an investigator. The

book's first printing of 500 copies

was made in June 1967.

Due to demand,

a second printing of 600 copies was made

in September 1968... The title page of the book sires

attribution to

Office of Security,

and the Brookings Institution Federal

Executive Fellorship.

The book is classified Confidential,

and it is our understanding that the distribution ras mace

of appropriate agencies of the federal Government.

A copy

book can be made available for review if

desired.

Sometime in 1972, a representative of the Law

Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAt) requested

that the Agency give consideration to our publishing, at

LEAA expense,

an unclassified version of this volume.

It

was the intent of LEiA to make broad-scale distribution

to Police Departments throughout the country.

The Director

of Security and I consulted on this matter and jointly

determined that the lead request should not be honored be-

cause

should not put itself in the position of

publishing law enforcement material for general and un-

classified purposes, and it would be an abuse of our print-

ing facilities.

b. On 5 January 1971, the Director of Security re-

quested that I approve his leasing up to eleven motor

vehicles for use in connection with a special support

operation which would last approximately 3 months.

The

Director of Security informed me, in his requesting meno-

randum of s January 1971, that "This support activity has

been undertaken at the specific instruction of the Director

•and has his personal approval." The request was approved.

c. From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has

requisitioned from this Office a considerable amount of

materiel which we understand was to be given or loaned by

them to local PolIce Departments.

of this materiel was issued from

Departments

In certain cases

some

and, in

other cases, direct procurement of the materiel as made

by funds furnished by the Office of Security. A complete

listing of such materiel is found in Attachnent 2.

SUBJECT

: Activity Related to Domestic Events

I. In late spring of 1968 Walt Rostow, then

Spocial Assistant to the President for National Security

Affairs, tasked the DCI with undertaking a survey of

worlawide student dissidence. Contronted by timult at

campuses like Columbia ond mindful of the violence

accompanying student outbursts at Berlin's Free University

and elsewhere, Rostow sought to learn whether youthful.

dissidence was interconnected; spawned by the same causes;

financed and hence manipulated by forces or influences

hostil: to the interests of the Us and its allies; or likely

to come under inimical sway to the detriment of US interests.

2. The paper was preparca by

Of OCI

with the assistance of the CA and CI Staffs.

The DDI,

D/OCI, and

met with Rostow to elicit the reasons

for his or the president's concerns and to agree on the

sources to be examined, the research methods to be followed,

etc.

3. Written during the summer of 1968, the most

sensitive version of Restless Youth comprisea two sections.

The first was

a philosophical treatment of student unrest,

its motivation, histor; and tactics.

This section drew

heavily on overt literature and FBI reporting on Students

for a Democratic Society anâ affiliated groups.

In a sense,

the survey of dissent emerged from a shorter (30 page)

typescript study of SDS and

its foreign ties the same

author had done for Mir. Rostow at the DCI's request in

December 1967.

4. Because of the paucity of information on foreign

student movements, it was necessary to focus on SDS which

then monopolized the field of student action here and

abroad.

A second section comprised 19 country chapters--

ranging from Argentina to Yugoslavia--and stood by itself

as a

review of foreign student dissidence.

full paper Restless Youth, including the essay on world-

wide dissent went only to nine readers. A copy may be

1. In late 1967

of several short intelligence memoranda dealing with the

foreign connections of US organizations and activists in-

volved in the anti-var movement. The main purpose of

these reports, prepared at the request of the Winite House,

was to determine nother any links existed between inter-

national Communist elonents or forcign governments and the

American paace movement.

The conclusion reached was that

there was some evidence of ad hoc contacts between anti-

war activists at home and abroad but no evidence of

direction or formal coordination.

2.

In October 1967 President Johnson expressed

interest in this subject and ordered a high level inter-

departmental survey.

In response to his personal recuest

to the DCI, Mr. Helms asked the ,

recipients of this

support have been the Department of Defense, the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, Immigration and Naturalization Scrvice, Department

of State, United States Postal Service, Secret Service, Agency

for International Development, and the White House.

3. While varying widely among the different rocipients, these

services have included training and materials, and in a few in

stances participation in the fields of audio and visual surveillance,

secret writing and related communications, personal protection,

disguise,

concealment devices, electronic beaconry, illicit narcotics detec-

tion, and counter-sabotage/terrorism.

4. In most instances requirements for this support are

received by TSD through higher echelons (Office of the Director

or Deputy Director for Operations). Unless the service involved

is a trivial or continuing one, the request is referred to the

Foreign Intelligence Staff Departmental Coordination Group for

coordination and approval at the appropriate Agency levels.

Approval within ISD by the Chief of Operations or Development

and Engineering and the Chief of ISD or his Deputy also is re-

quired.

• FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TSD has had a close working relationship with the FBI over

the past few years. The FBI is the only organization that has

been fully briefed on TSD audio techniques and equipment. The

following are situations where ISI equipment and guidance were

involved in operations:

(A) Identity 59

installed.

- Four masked transmitters were

Two have failed and to remain workable.

(B) Identity 60

- A TSD built masked transmitter

was installed to collect emanations from a crypto-

graphic machine. The system continues to function

when samples of the emanations are needed.

(C)

Identity 61

- Two transmitters have been

installed and are operating. One is specifically

designed to collect the sounds of typewriting, the

other is a straight audio transmitter to colluct con-

versations. A FBI agent is manning the listening

post.

A third system

is not oper-

ating, probably due to battery expiration. The tape

made from this room

was made by the National

Security Agency before failure.

(D) Identity 62

- ISD furnished equipment and con-

sultation covering Identity 62.

First masked switched trans-

mitters were used in two apartments used as tempor-

ary quarters. Later masked switched transmitters

and microwave transmitters were installed in the

permanent quarters along with mic and wire installa-

tions, entirely furnished by the Bureau. This install-

ation is not fully opcrational because the full comple-

ment of personnel have not yet arrived.

(E) Iden

This is an operation with additional

participation by National Security Agency. It is

designed in anticipation of the Identity 64

in Washington. The listening post was

obtained by using

mechanisms

for procuring the property. New systems are

being designed and produced by using ISD's covert

contractor mechanisms and TSD engineers.

(F) Identity 65

- Ten masked audio devices pur -

chased from ISD were installed in Identity 65

by the FBI. Part of the equipment was install-

ed in November and December 1971, the remaining

equipment was installed 17 - 25 March 1972. Tests

made by a TSD officer from a temporary FBI

listening post on 8 - 9 November 1972, proved that

the target equipment no longer functioned and was

believed discovered by the occupants.

(G) TSD has furnished equipment items which constitute

an on-the-shelf capability to engage in photo and

audio surveillance operations which might not be

known to the Agency. In one case it is known that a

relatively unsophisticated device was used against

a domestic target.

My total contact with other agencies in terms of assistance

with domestic operations has been in the field of audio sur-

veillance countermeasures, anti-hijacking, or drugs. Speci-

fically, I participated in TSCC and RED Subcommittee meetings

which included technology exchanges and some equipment ex-

changes on a temporary basis ostensibly for testing or trial.

• I also assisted in x-rajing the office walls of the Chairman

• of the NEC (then Mr. Schlesinger) at the request of Mr. Richard

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Secretary,

Committee

SUBJECT

: Reported Identity 61

Management

, Burglary

1. Attached is a report summarizing what we know about the

reported break-in of Identity 61.

An investigative report

by an officer of the Exccutive Protective Service states that the

offices were ransacked and a number of personal items stolen.

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

2. The attached summary also describes a separate audio

operation conducted against Identity 61

by the FBI, at the

behest and with its technical support.

This presents a

related question that should be noted. James McCord's' testimony

indicates that he placed telephone calls to the Identity 75 and Identity

61.

He says he picked the numbers at random, hoping

that if his phone was tappod his attorneys would be able to challenge

the evidence as being tainted. Another witness, John Caulfield,

says McCord called the two named Iden 75 and Iden 61 because he "was sure"

they "were subjects of national security wiretaps. "

3. In fact, there has been a long-standing telephone lap on the

Identity 75

, r'un by the FBI, about which

believes McCord

knew. It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sort of operation

against Identity 61

, and assumed that it was also a telephone

tap. One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping

that both his lelephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, and

that one way or another his case would be dismissed or dropped

because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive

operations.

At this point, given the publicity of the Iden 61 break-in,

and the lestimony of McCord and Caulfield, the current investigations

may lead to exposure of the operations.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT

: Reported Burglary of the Identity 61

1. The press reported a burglary of Identity 61

13-14

May 1973. An investigative report by an officer of the Executive

Protective Service states that the offices were ransacked and a

number of personal items were stolen. There were some latent

fingerprints, but no identilication was made. The FBI, which states

that the incident was on 15 May, did not investigatc because it

mined that it did not have jurisdiction. The Identity 61

deter-

registered a formal complaint and American regrets were expressed,

Identity 61

making it clear that they suspected something other than

ordinary robbery. We have no additional information on the subject.

There had been an carlier intelligence operation against the Identity 61

which is described below.

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

2. On 10 April 1971

proposed to the FBI the instal-

lation of technical coverage of Identity 61

The opportunily

for such an installation came about when a domestic asset of Foreign

Resources Division reported that he had been asked to submit a bid

for a contract to renovate

Identity 61

Upon securing the

contract the asset was willing to augment his work force as appropriate

or install material which would be provided him

3. On 23 April 1971 FBI Director John Edgar Hoover turned

down the Agency proposal. That same day CIA Director Richard Helms

sent a letter to Attorney-General John Mitchell requesting that the FBI

turndown be reversed, citing the importance of the Iden 61 target and

national intelligence needs to collect positive intelligence.

On 24 April

the Attorney-General reversed the FBI decision and the Washington

Field Office of the Bureau was instructed to proceed with the operation.

4. During the period from 26 April to 18 May all the

technical equipment from the Agency to the FBI was delivered,

installed and tested. Everything seemed to be working. No Agency.

personnel were involved in any way with actual installation of

equipment in

Identity 61 From May to February Agency tech-

nicians helped calibrate, reset and do other repair work on occasions

of equipment failure in the FBI listening post. On no occasion dia

they enter. Identity 61.

5. The Agency requested that coverage of Identity 61 • be

stopped on 3 February 1972 after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

advised that he was scheduled shortly to testify in Congress and

might have to advise them that the installation in Identity 61

was initiated at

request. The operation and equipment, to the

best of the Agency's knowledge, was dormant until 8 December 1972

when the FBI was asked by the Agency to reactivate coverage. The

request at this time was occasioned by the knowledge that a Iden 76

delegation would be arriving in Washington for discussions on

nationalization of foreign holdings,

While the EBI was still

in the process of reactivating the equipment, the Department of

State on 20 December 1972 requested the FBI to institute all possible

coverage of Identity 61

and on 22 December 1972 coverage

was partially reinstituted with full coverage in effect by 26 December

1972.

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

6. A review of the take from the operation, weighed against

the risks involved, led the Agency to conclude that the activity was

not worth continuing. On 16 February 1973 L

requested the E BI

tó discontinue the coverage. On 22 February 1973 the FBI advised

that microphone surveillance of Iden 61

was discontinued.

MEMOR ANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Identity 61

Break In on 15 May 1972

1. On 24 May 1973 I telephoned MI. James Robinson,

General Crime Section, Department of Justice and asked if he

had any information as to criminal prosecution of persons involved

in a break in at Identity 61

• in Washington, D.C. on

15 May 1972. Mr. Robinson stated he had no knowledge of this but

suggested that it would be better to check with Mr. G. Marvin Gentile,

Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security, Department of State, and

the Secret Service since they had responsibilities for the Executive

Protective Service (EPS). I telephoned MI. Gentile and he identi-

fied to State Department cables rclative to the incident; one from

the embassy in Santiago to the Department, No. 2450, dated

15 May 1972, Subjoct: Unauthorized Entry Outlining the Protest

of the Iden 76 Covernment presented to the American Embassy,

and the State Department reply to Santiago, No. 0S1655, dated

15 May 1972. Mr. Gentile also identified the EPS report of

investigation and suggested that I get a copy from the Seciet Scrvice.

I then callad Mr. Tom Kelly at Secret Service and he had his liaison

man deliver me a copy of the EPS report of investigation.

2. On 25 May 1973 I Icceived a call from FBI Agent

Ray Mullens on green phone No. 5303 stating that he had received

a telephone call from Mi. James Robiason relative to my inquiry

about prosecution. Mr. Mullens indicated that the FBI Washington

Field Office had recontacted the Vietropolitan Police Department (MPD)

on 24 May and reviewed the report No. 218-424 filed with the 3rd

District, MPD which states that a break in occurred at Identity 61

between 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. on 15 May 1972.

Reported loss at tha

ime consisted of four am/fr

adios

and one electric razor.

The police investigation identified

some latent fingerprints bui no identification of those prints

was made. Since the reported loss was under $5, 000 and there

was. no evidence of a crossing of state boundries, the FBI did

not make an investigation of the incident. The MPD reported

that there had baen no prosecution and no suspect was identified.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Mr. Willian E.

Colby

Special Activities

1. Following our recent conversation, I have

searched

my memory and Mr. McConc's files for examples

of activitics which to hostile observors or to soncone

without complete knowledge and with a special kind of

motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities

exceeding

JEK Act 6 (1) (B)

2. First, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962,

DCI McCone, under pressure from Attorney General Robert

F. Kennedy, agreed

to tap the telephones of columnists

Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott in an cffort to identify

their sources for classified information which was appoar-

ing in their columns.

Because the primary source appeared

to be in the Department of

Defense, MeCone ordered me

personally to brief Gencral Joe Carroll, Director of DIA,

orally, which

I did. I

understand more

complete information

on this operation is available from the Director of security.

I, personally, managed to avoid gaining any knowledge of

whät piecise actions

were taken, what information vas gained,

what was done with it, and when the opcration was terminated.

3. As a rosult of a devcloping relationship with

IDEN-122

and

thelDEN-123rCpresentative in Washington,

also as a rosult of certain information conveyed by

IDEN-124

, James Angleton, with the approval oi

Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation

against the

IDEN-95

in Washington.

This involved

breaking and entering and the removal of documents from

the

IDEN-126

On 18 June 1962, DCI McCone and

Helmis briefed Secretary of State Rusk generally.on the

operation without going into operational details: Later

on the same day, President John F. Kennedy was briefed.

Actual breaking

and entcring occurred. somewhat later, and

on 15 April 1963: DCI McCone met with President Kennedy

alone and briefed the President on the dotails of this

new phase of the operation.

On the same day, the Attorney

General was briefed and he agiced that he would not

mention it to the FBI unless the FBI therselves raised

it with hin. On 3 February 1964, DCI McCone met alone

with President Lyndon B. Johnson

and briefed him on the

opcration.

On 1 February McGeorge Bundy was briefed.

On 6 February 1964 in a briefing

of Secretary of State

Rusk on the results

of the opcration, Rusk expressed

rescrvations about the propricty of such an operation.

He rnised this same concern in subsequent conversations

with Mccone on 17 April 1061. 28 May 1961, and 14 June

1961. On 12 September 1961 Rusk continuca to express

grave reservations and repeatedly suggested that the

IDEN-i3 be informed dirocrly that we know about their

espionage operations

i.n

the United States and ask them

to desist. In a

meeting on 28 May 1961 Rusk expressed

these reservations in the prosence of DCI McCone and

President Join I.. Kennedy: Secretary of Defense McNamara

was also

present, and thore is no record that he had

previously been made aware of this operation.

• 4. Although certain activities never got beyond

the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples

of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation.

One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice

crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam.

A second involved

a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear instal-

lations.

Outside the United States Government, General

Eisenhower was briefed on such planning.

A third, which

assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by

Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence

collection effort against foreign installations in this

country. This planning also involved a scheme for selected

exposure of KGB activities and counteractions against the

Soviet intelligence service. The reasons are still unclear

to me as to why the FBI chose to brief the PrIAB to the

effect that

and

generally to use KGB-type tactics, also extensively and

indiscriminately.

This led to a heated exchange between

DCI icCone and Vir. Belmont of the FBI, one such meeting

taking place in the presence of the Attorney General.

It is clear that the IBI was opposed to any such proposal

then, as now, and the plan never went forward..

5. During the period when Des FitzGerald was in

charge of the Cuban Task Force, DCI McCone's office

learned, quite by

accident, that FitzGorald had secured

the coopcration of several prominent US business firms

in denying

economic items to Cuba.

There was no question

but that the businessmen were glad to cooperate, but know-

ledge of this operation had to be rather widespicad.

6. On 17 April 1961, Mr. Robert B. Anderson came

to DCJ. McCone

on behalf of American business interests,

offering to insert some $300,000 to try to secure a

favorable result in the clections in Panama.

Shortly

after

this

approach.

IDEN-128

of

IDEN-129

made a similar proposal to McCone in connection

with elections in

Chile.

On 12 May 1964 at a meeting of

the 303 Committce, it was decided that the offers of

American business

could not be

accepted. it being neither

• secure way nor an honorable way of

doing such business.

This declaration of policy at this time bears on the recent

ITT hearings, but I am not surprised that McCone has

forgotten that he helped to set the precedent of refusing

to accopt such collaboration between the Agency's operations

and private business.

7.

At the direction of Attorney General Robert

Kennedy and

/ McCone injected

with the explicit approval of President Kennedy,

into the US labor situation, and particularly to try

to ameliorate the quarrel between George Meany and

Walter

Reuther. IEN-36

stcered a very skillful

course in this connection, but the Agency could be

vulnerable to charges that

we went behind leany's back,

or were somehow consorting with Reuther against Meany's

wishes.

10. Under the heading of old business, I know that

any one who has worked in the Director's office has worried

about the fact that conversations within the offices and

the telephones

were transcribed.

tenure, there were microphones in his regular office,

his inner office, his dining room, his office in East

Building, and his study at his rosidence on thite haven

Street.

I do not know who would be willing to

raise such

an issue, but knowledge of such operations tends to

spread, and cortainly the Agency is vulnerable on this

score.

Il. Also under the heading of old business, I

well remember the hue and cry raised, especially by Carl

Kaysen in the White House, when

shortly after the cuban missile crisis, there was

a disposition in lashington to reexamino the Bay of Pigs,

and the fact that several Alabama National dir Guard

officers lost their lives in the Bay of Pigs was surfaced

with surprisingly little excitement at the time. JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

13. Finally, DCI NcCone, as you and I well know,

operated on a very lofty plane,

and

I think certain of

his activitios could be misunderstood: One example was

his decision in July of 1961 to have Aristotle Onassis

i and

Maria Callas flown

from Rome

to. Athens

on Air Force KC 135.

Their arrival in Athens in this airplane attracted the

attention of the local press and in

Hightower, Chief of the Associated Press Bureau for

Washington, came to see me to ask about the propriety

of this

action.

14. The use of

IDEN-132

aircraft

has been remarkably secure, but DCI lIcCone himself

foigot about the cover arrangement and became quite

exercised when he saw Candidate Goldwater land in the

San Francisco airport for the Republican National Con-

vention in 1961 aboard the

IDE N-133

with

the highly visible tail number IDEN+134. This

was, I

explained to him carefully, a perfectly legitimate

charter, but he didn't like it.

15. McCone dealt quite extensively with newsmen

in Washington. In fact; they gave him a gift and a

luncheon when

he left lashington, which is

perhaps

indicative of the press's relations with him.

However,

in the case of the Ross and Wise book, The Invisible

Government, he did try to bring pressure on the publisher

and the authors to change things.

They did not change

a comma, and I doubt that this old saw willwer sing

again.

16. Finally, and this will reflect my Middle

Western Protestant

upbringing, icCone's dealings with

the Vatican, including Pope John XXIII

VI,

and Pope Paul

would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.

17. The above listing is uneven, but I have a

sinking feeling that discipline has broken down, and that

allegations from any quarter which cast these things in

• the wiong light would receive great publicity and attention,

and no amount of denial would

ever set the record

SUBJECT: Foreign Support For Activities Planned to Disrupt

1. There are only linited indications thus far of

foreign efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of

activitics designed to disrupt or harass the National

Convention of the Republican Party in San Diego, 21-23

August 1972.

2.

Some American participants at the Soviet-controlled

World Assembly for Peace and Indeyendence of the Peoples of

Indochina, held 11-13 February 1972 in Paris/Versailles,

attempted

unsuccessiully to include a call tor international

demonstrations to take place at the time

of the Republican

National Convention. A representative of the San Diego

• Convention Coalition (SDCC), one of the domestic action

groups targetting on the

Republican Convention, requested

the Anerican Delegations' Steering Committee at the World

Assembly to include a specific call for international

support of activities against the Republican convention

in their proposal to the Iction Commission of the World

Assembly. This request, however, was

dropped as

too

divisive by the Steering Committce, despite initial indica-

tions that the proposal would be taken to the floor of

the Assembly.

John LENNON, a British

subject, has provided

financial support to

Forcign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican Vational Convention

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

Indications remain limited, thus far, of foreign efforts

to inspire, support or take advantage of activities designed

to disrupt or harass the National Convention of the Republican

_Party in San Diego, 21-23 August 1972. The concept of coordinated

international support for domestic activities in the United

States was generally endorsed at the recent world Assembly for

Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina; however, the

Conference issued no spocific call

for international support of

disruptive actions at the American national political conventions.

BACKGROUND:

At the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace and

Independence of

the Peoples of Indochina, held in Versailles

from 10-15 February 1972, there was mention of American plans

for demonstrations at both the Republican and Democratic

National Conventions. The final draft resolution from the

Conference's "Action Commission"

contains an appendix submitted

by Anerican delegates whose goal was

to secure global coordination

for domestic actions in the United States. It calls for inter-

national support to six wecks of domestic antivar actions and

demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with

the statement:

"This

campaign will lead up to the Democratic

Paxty. Convention at Miami

on July 9, 1972, and the

Republican

Party Convention in San Dicgo on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly for the

Peacc"and Independence of the Indochinese People" of

13 February

1972; drafted by the "Political Commission" states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest

against

the war is voiced more and more strongly, under various

strations which now affect even the

such as draft evasions, desertions, resistance, demon-

soldiers.

The Assembly

calls for support to these progressive and

antiwar forces in

the United

States, and asks the

governments

to grant asylum

to doserters and to support their right to repatriation.

All together, the pooples of the world will efficiently

Foreign Su

rt for Activities Plann

to Disrupt

SUMMARY:

There is little now evidence of foreign plans or efforts

to inspire, support, or take

advantage of actions

designed to

disrupt of

harass the Republican National Convention in San

Diego, 21 to 23. August 1972.

The Students for a Democratic

society, in joining the ranks of domestic groups planning

actions

at the

Republican Convention, has

adopted a proposal

to cooperate with dexican workers and students in a demonsura-

tion in Tijuana, Mexico, during the Convention. The San Diego

the North Vietnamese. The letter is of interest as an indica-

tion of North Vietnamese contact with the SDCC; such contact

will be required for the SDCC to implement its carlier-reported

plans for broadcasts over public address systems during the

Convention of live telephone calls from the Vietnamese in

Paris.

DEVELOPMENTS:

At its recent convention in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

held 30 March to 2 April 1972, the Students for a Democratic

Socioty (SDS) adopted a proposal

to hold demonstrations at

the San Diego-Tijuana border during the Republican National

Convention.

The proposal included

a call for SDS to cooperate

with Mexican workers

and students in an action to

occur during

a fiesta in Tijuana, where Convention delegates will be

entertained.

The North Victnamese have given their endorsement to

the San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC) in

the form of a

letter from the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the

American People (VCSWAP), a quasi-official organ of the

North Vietnanese Government.

The letter, which has been

circulated by the SDCC and is dated 27 January 1972,

expresses "great delight" with the formation of the

SDCC

and conveys the Committce's "best wishes of militant soii-

darity and friendship."

The VCSWAP requests

that the

SDCC

write often and "send us materials you have."

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY:

There are no new indications of specific foreign plans or efforts to

inspire, support, influence, or exploit activities designca to disrupt or

harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21-24 August

1972. Although mectings have been held rocently in Paris, France, between

Amcrican antiar activists and representatives of the Democratic Republic

of North Victriam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of

South Victnam (PRG), currently available information indicates that the

DRV/PRG officials mace no efforts to encourage or give guidance to the

American participants with respect to the upcoming Republican National

Convention. Private discussions, separate from the mectings with the entire

American delegation, were conducted by both the DRV and the PRG officials;

at present, we have no information regarding the substance of these private

exchanges. A sccond group of activists, considered more important than

the first delegation, is scheculed to travel to Paris on or about 1 August 1972

for further consultations with the PRG and DRV representatives.

DEVELOP.IENTS:

In recent meetings in Paris, France, with members of an American

deligation sponsored by the Anti-War Union (AWU), representatives of

the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary

Government of South Victnam (PRG) were very guarded with respect to dis-

cussing activities at the Republican National Convention. Although the Vietnam-

ese repeatedly questioned the Americans concerning the mood of the antiwar

movement in the United States, they made no direct reference to the Repub-

lican Convention, except for one instance when PRG Deputy Chief Nguyen

Van TIEN accused President Nixon of using the private and public sessions

of the Paris peace talks as "propaganda for the Republican Convention."

TIEN then urged the Americans to promote and propagandize the Seven

Point Plan offered by the PRG. The Americans, too, for the most part,

refrained from discussing the Convention, other than to estimate that demon-

strators will number about 10,000 at the Convention.

Following their meeting on 22 July 1972 with the AWU delegation,

Is no information available concerning the substance of these private

A second, more important delegation of Americans connected with

the Anti-War Union is scheduled to travel to Paris circa 1 August 1972

for further consultation with DRV and PRG representatives. This second

group is scheduled to be led by Rennie DAVIS, founcier and leader of the

AWU. This will be DAVIS' second trip to Paris within recent months for

discussions with DRV and PRG representatives. Upon his return from

his first trip, DAVIS publicly stated that the AWU would demonstrate at

both the Democratic and the Republican Convention, but that the AWU's

chief target would be the Republican Convention.

United States Icading up to the Democratic and Republican

Conventions, but made no specific call for support of dis-

ruptive actions at the conventions themselves.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In early April 1972 an

influential and well-informed

staff nonber of the Stockholm Conference on

Vietnam discussed,

in private, the international anti-Vietnam lar activities

conducted

on 1, 15, and 22 April.

The Stockholm Conference

member stated that

these actions were part of an international

campaign in support of domestic American

antivar

efforts

during the period 1 April to 15 May 1972, and "will culminate

at the election conventions in July and August."

The World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the

Peoples of Indochina, of which the Stockholm Conference was

a major organizer, had carlier enunciated a similar statement

in an appendix to

the final draft resolution of the Assembly's

'"Action Commission." The appendix called for international

support to six weeks of domestic antilar actions and demon-

strations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concluded with

the statement:

"This campaign will lead up to the Democratic

Party Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

-or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMMARY:

Indications remain linited of forcign plans or attenpts

to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed

to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in

Miani, Florida, 10-13 July 1972. A member of the Swedish

• Vietnam, who is also a member of the Secre-

tariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam, has stated

that the U.S. National Elections are playing a role in

the Swedish Connittee's work.

The British-based Interna-

tional Confederation for Disarmament and Peace (ICDP) has

distributed a "Spring Offensive Calendar" of activities

in the United States against the war based on a submission

by the Peoples' Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ).

The calendar includes actions planned in connection with

the Democratic Convention.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In mid-April 1972, a member of the Swedish Committec

for Victnan, tho is also an influential and

well-informed

staff. rember of the Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference

on Vietnam, stated in a private discussion of the Swedish

Committee's unusually heavy work load that "things will be

hectic right until the elections in the U.S."

The International Confederation for Disarmament and

Peace, a British-based antivar

organization and one of the

more prominent member organizations of the Stockholm Con-

ference, has attached a

"Spring Offensive Calendar" to the

April-May 1972 issue of its regular international publica-

tion Vietnan International. The calendar had been

furnished

by the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and

included the following entry:

July 9 - 12 Democratic Convention, Miami Beach.

SUMMARY:

The only new indication of foreign plans of efforts

the political conventions of both major parties.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In mid-day 1972, a member of the North Vietnamese Dele-

gation to the Paris Peace Talks invited a visitor to contact

him again when the visitor returned from an imminent trip

MEMORANDUM FOR : Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT

: Areas of Possible Embarrassment

to the Agency

1. Sometime in the spring or early summer of 1971, Mr. John

Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to

the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). The original request was

non-specific but it gradually emerged that Dean was concerned with

the possible advoise publicity thai might develop regarding the

President's nephew, who was employed by lOS.

2. There were multiple channels from the White House to the

Agency on this subject:

a. Presumably Haldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director

Helms.

b. Someone (unnamed) in the White House to the DDCI,

General Cushman (sce attached telephone conversation).

Note that Ehrlichman is mentioned, and

c.

John Dean to the CI Staff.

These various channels

were sorted out in time and six reports were passed by

the CI Staff to Mr. Fred Fielding for Mr. John Dean.

3. The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since

it gives the flavor of White House concern.

It took several days to

uncover the fact that the White House intorest centered on the involve-

ment of the President's nephew with IOS and possible adverse publicity.

The reports submitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were

coordinated with the DCI. After a few months, interest in this sub-,

ject died down and we did not pursue it further.

" 4. Please return the attachments when they have served your

purpose.

5. I also include a short note on the Intelligence Evaluation

Committee and Staff prepared byl

The original

meetings were held in the office of John Dean at the White House

and the principal sparkplug for this group activity was the then

Assistant Attorncy General for Internal Security, Robert Mardian

and then later his assistant, William Olsen. It is noted that Mi.

Mardian is now appearing before the Grand Jury and'it is always

possible that he might draw in the Agency.

JEK Act 6 (1) (B) •

6. Before appointing

to the IES Staff as the Agency

representative, I had attended various inter-agency mectings pre-

sided over by Mardian. I expressed the view to Director Helms

that Mardian would require very careful handling due to his inex-

perience.

Furthermore, Mardian was deeply involved in the split

between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. On a confidential basis

one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullivan was secretly

passing files to Mardian without Mi. Hoover's permission.

This

was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from

the Bureau.

SUBJECI: The MHCHAOS Program

1. The MHCHAOS program is a worldwide program for

clandestine collection abroad of information on foreign

efforts to support/encourage/exploit/manipulate domestic

U.S. extremism, especially by Cuba, Communist China,

North Vietnam,

the Soviet Union, Noith Korea and the

Arab fedayeen.

2. - The MHCHAOS program has not and is not conduct-

ing efforts domestically for internal domestic collection

purposes. Agency efforts arc foreign. Foreign-oriented

activity in the United States has been of two types:

a .

Selected FBI domestic

sources who travel

abroad in connection with their extremist activity

and/or affiliations

make

contact with hostilc

foreign powers or with forcign cxtremist groups

have

been brieled

and debriefed by Icadquarters

officers.

The

bracting has included appropriate

operational guidance, including defensive advice.

b. Americans with existing extremist creden-

tials have bech assessed, recruited, tested and

dispatched abroad for PCS assignnents as contract

agents

primarily sources offered for such use by

the FBI.

When

abroad they collcct intormation re-

sponsive to MUCILOS program requirements, as well

as other Agency icquircments.

They are thus

used

primarily for targeting against Cubans, Chinese Con-

munists, the North Vietnamese, etc., as their back-

Ching tacon

ground and their particular access permits.

should be noted that the UPTROIkl aspoct of the

MPLODESTAR project of the

East Asia Division is

similar to the MICHAOS PROGRAM.

3. As indicated earlier, MCHAOS is a foreign pro-

gram, conducted overseas, except for the limited activity

described above. The program

is

and

has been managed so

as to achieve the maximum

feasible utilization of exist-

ing resources of the Operations Dircctorate.

program.

Instead, emphasis has

been placed on the exploi-

tatIon

of new and

old agency assets who have a by-product

capability or a concurrent capability for provision of

information responsive to the program's requirements.

This has involved the provision of custon-tailored collec-

tion requirements

and

operational guidance.

This collec-

tion program is viewed as an integral part of the recruit-

ment and

collection programs of China Operations, Vietnam

Operations, cuban Uperations, Soviet BiOC Division opera-

cions and Korean Branch operations.

Agents who have an

Anerican "Movement" background or who have known connec-

tions with the

American

"lovement" are useful as access

agents to obtain biographic and personality data, to dis-

cern possible vulncrabilities and susccptibilitics; and

to develop operationally exploitable relationships with

recruitment targets of the above programs.

These assets

are of interest

to our

targets because of their connec-

tions with and/or knowledge of the American "Movement."

Over the course of the MHCHAOS program, there

have been

approximatoly 20 important arcas of operational interest

which at the present time have been reduced to about ton?

Paris, Stockholm,

Brussels, Dar Es Salaam, Conakry, Algiers,

Moxico City, Santiago, Ottawa and Hong Kong.

4. The MUCILOS program also utilizes audio opera-

tions,

two of which have

been implemented to cover

tax-

gets

of special

interest.

5. MHCHAOS reporting from abroad relating to the

program originates in two ways: Individuals who are noted

in contact with Cubans, the Chinese Conmunists, etc., and

who appear to have extremist connections, interests

Or

background are reported upon. Other individuals are ro-

ported upon in response to specific Headquarters require-

ments received from the FBI because such individuals. are

of active investigatory security interost to the FBI.

All cable and dispatch traffic related to the

MHCHAOS program is sent via

restricted channels. It is

not processed by either the Cable Socretariat or the In-

formation Services Division. The control and retriev-

ability of infornation obtained, including information

received from the FBI, is the responsibility of the spe-

cial Opcrations Group.

ments is disseminated to

the FBI via special controlled

dissemination channels, i.c., by restricted handling cable

traffic or via special pouch and specially numbered blind

memoranda.

8. Information of particular significance, when col-

lectod, has been disseminated by spocial menorandun over

d. Question: What is the arrangement re recruiting

out of colleges? Any clearances or prohibitions?

Answer: As of now CSI 50-10 specifically

requires approval by the. ADDO or DDO for any

recruitment attempt made in the United Siates

against an American member of the academic

community or a loreign target attending an American

academic institution. This regulation is presently in

the process of revision in thai this approval authority

for academic recruitments in the United States is to

be delegated to Chief, ER. The approval authority

for recruitment attempts against American students

outside the United States is to be delegated to the Chief

of the appropriate area division. The only prohibitions

at the present time are those precluding iccruitment

attempts against foreign students here in tlie United States

on grants from Ford Foundation, Rockefeller or Fulbright.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT:

Foreign Resources Division Operational

Activities with Possible Flap Potential

1. At thr risk of stating the obvious, almost all of the operational

activities carried on by FR Division in the United States run the risk

that unauthorized disclosure could create embarrassment to the Agency.

We have accepted this as a condition precedent and have proceeded with

our operational activities in the most professional manner possible under

the circumstances. There are cortain rather unusual activities in which

ER Division has participated and/or is participating that contain some-

what greater possibility for embarrassment if discovered. I have listed

these below, not necessarily in order of embarrassment potential:

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

a.

provides a fairly considerable

amount of support to Di. Kissinger in his contacts with the

Chinesc. This support was authorized by Mr. Karamessines

and Mr.

Holms. Thus far there has been no problem other

than the inordinate amount of time spent by

personnel, not to mention the fairly sizeable amount of

money that has been expended in support of these efforts.

b. A CIA Officer

is to be assigned to FR Division.

CIA Officer is presently assigned overseas

under deep

cover:

The

In discussions between

NOCAD and the ADDO, it was decided that the Officer

would

be pulled out

and reassigned in the United States.

FR Division was directed to accept this officer for assignment.

We have concluded that the best solution is to have this

officer attend a university in the Midwest for at least

a year, working towards an advanced degree until there

has been time for the situation to clarify itself. We plan

to make no operational use of tie CIA Offisa? whatsoever,

during the period of time that he is attending the university.

Upon completion of his year's study, we will review the .

situation and decide the nexi course of action at that time.

Paragraph 1. c. is deleted because it contains sensitive

d. FR Division has been briefed in general on the

existence of an audio opcration done by the FBI

In San Francisco.

This operation is directed

for this activity has come from

VIII. Coordination

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

A.

• Internal

In developing its cadre of general support assets

and access agents, the FR Division maintains close contact

with the

of the Directorate for

Intelligence, using their assets wherever and

whenever

possible to

support FR's operational activities.

To a

more linited degree, FR Bases

maintain contacts with Office

of Security and Office of Personnel field representátives,

pursuing the occasional leads surfaced by these officers

and using their entre to specific individuals who can

provide access to targets of operational interest.

B. External

FR officers

in the field maintain coordination with

their FBI counterparts. There is limited cooperation

with Bureau offices on internal security cases involving

Soviet and Bloc officials and the local FBI offices are

of occasional help in operations involving other nationals.

The local

field offices of the FBI are made aware of the

presence of FR officers in their jurisdictions and have on

occasion provided backstopping on cases where there was.

some flap potential.

Coordination with the FBI of FR Division's agent

recruitment activity is governed by an agreement between

the Agency and the FBI dated 7 February 1966.

The Bases

also have contact with local Immigration

At the meeting between Mr. Kelley and the Attorney

General, along with their respective staffs on 7/21/75, the Attorney

General determined that there should be broad disclosure of material

in the files of those Senators on the Senate Select Committee requesting

access to same and that in the main the Bureau should only restrict

access to revelation of live informants or information which would

reveal the identity of live informants. In addition, he indicated that

in his review of the file on Senator Hart he noted certain derogatory

information on relatives which he felt Senator Hart should not see.

Also, there may be criminal investigations against one of the Senators

of such a nature that revelation should be restricted.

It was agreed that Deputy Assistant Attorney General

O'Connor and I should review the files in order to determine problem

areas and Mr. O'Connor would consul: wite ase Tylers, ede

Files have been reviewed and there is general agreement

that almost all of the information can be revealed with certain limited

excisions taking care of problem areas. Mr. O'Connor advised One

7/24/75 that he has been in touch with the Committee and they will make

arrangements to come to my office and review their fifes Ahlmy presence

along with Mr. O'Connor. Senator Goldwater has added his name to the

list and Mr. McDermott has been advised in order to insure all pertinent

material is accumulated.

FBI INFORMATION-GATHERING PRACTICES

WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

There is a total of more than 6,500,000 files at

FBI Headquarters.

Most of these contain information gathered

during investigation of matters-including some 100 types of

criminal, security, and applicant-employee cases--assigned to

the FBI by laws of Congress, directives of the President, and

orders of the Attorney General.

The remainder of these more than 6,500,000 files

include:

(1) Personnel files regarding FBI applicants.and

employees;

(2)

General files regarding FBI contacts and

dealings with a variety of individuals and

organizations concerning matters that do

not require or involve FBI investigation; and

; {3)

Administrative-type files, such as those of a

policy nature, those containing statistical

reports, those detailing FBI cooperative

services, and the like.

An unknown, but extremely small, percentage of

these more than 6,500,000 FBI files contain information

regarding present or former Congressmen anã Senators which

mays have been accumulated prior to, during, or after their

tenure in Congress.

WHAT FBI FILES CONTAIN ON CONGRESSMEN:

FBI Files contain substantially the same types of

information regarding Senators and Congressmen as is contained

in them about other citizens.

Basically this information falls

into the following categories:

Violations of Law

(1)

Allegations that Congressmen or Senators have

violated Federal. laws within the FBI's jurisdiction.

The FBI investigates such allegations whether they

relate to Members of Congress or any other person.

The

results of these investigations are furnished to United States

Attorneys and/or other prosecutive officials of the Department

of Justice.

The investigation may establish (a) that the

Congressnan or Senator has, in

fact, violated a Federal law,

(b) that a Federal law has been violated, but that the involve-

ment of the Congressman or Senator in that violation cannot be

established, (c) that a Federal law has been violated, but

that the Congressman or Senator clearly had no involvement

in its violation, or (d) that no violation of Federal law

was committed.

Included among such allegations involving Congress-

men and Senators have been the following types of violations

within the FBI's jurisdiction: Bank Fraud and Embezzlement;

Conflict of Interest; Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice; Election

Laws; Frauã Against the Government; and Interstate Transporta-

tion

in Aid of

Racketeering.

(2) Violations of Federal laws within the FBI's

jurisdiction involving Congressmen and Senators as victims.

The results of FBI investigations of such violations

are furnished to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecu

tive officials of the Department of Justice.

In many instances,

the original complaint in these cases is received from the law

maker-victim himself; however, if the information originates

elsewhere, the FBI promptly notifies the Congressman or. Senator

involved of the threat which has been made.

In addition; other

law enforcement agencies which have a legitimate interest in

these cases are notified of the threat.

Violations of the Congressional Assassination, Kid-

naping and Assault Statute, Bomb Threats, and Extortion

among the crimes within the FBI's jurisdiction which have

involved lawmakers as victims.

(3) Allegations that members of the staffs of

Congressmen or Senators have violated Federal laws within the

FBI's jurisdiction, or that these staff members have been

victims of such violations.

The FBI investigates such allegations and furnishes

the results to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecutive

officials of the Department of Justice. Where appropriate, the

Congressman or Senator involved is also advised of the investi-

gation.

Congressmen and Senators may be interviewed by the

FBI in these cases involving Congressional aides--just as they

may be interviewed in connection with other types of FBI

investigations--and both the fact of, and the results of,

such interviews are noted in the file reflecting the FBI

investigation.

(4) Allegations that Senators cr Congressmen have

violated laws within the jurisdiction of other investigative

agencies.

These allegations are brought to the attention of

the agency concerned--Federal, state, or local. Such allega-

tions are not investigated by the FBI. However, the coopera-

tive services of the FBI Laboratory, Identification Division,

and National Crime Information Center are available to other

law enforcement agencies in the investigation of these, as

well as other, crimes.

Applicant Investigations

(5)

Present and former Congressmen and Senators

often are considered for positions in the Executive or

Judicial Branches of the Federal Government which require

that the FBI conduct a thorough background investigation

of them.

Dependent, upon the nature of the position involved,

the results of these investigations are furnished to the White

House, the Department of Justice, and/or other appropriate

Government agencies.

• (6) Congressmen and Senators often are interviewed

in the course of applicant-type investigations regarding

other persons who are being considered for Executive or

Judicial positions--as well as during applicant-type investi

gations conducted by the FBI (at the request of the Committee

chairman involved) concerning staff members of a limited

number of House and Senate Committees. Both the fact of, and

the results of, the interview of the Congressman or Senator

are noted in the file reflecting the FBI's investigation.

Security Cases

(?) Either prior to, during, or subsequent to their

tenure in Congress, there may be files pertaining to security-

type matters which

• relate to members of

the House and Senate,

or Congressmen may be identified in FBI files as actual or

intended victims of acts by subjects of security-type cases.

The Statutes covering such matters are Title 18, Section 2383

Advocating overthrow of Government by force).

oral or Written Contact

(8) An unknown number of FBI files contain copies

of correspondence between the FBI and Congressmen and Senators

concerning a wide variety of matters which include bills

pending in, or passed by,

Congress; personnel matters; the

Bureau's cooperative services; and FBI policies, procedures,

and investigations. Many of these letters from Congressmen

and Senators have been prompted by inquiries which these

lawmakers have received from constituents or other interested

citizens.

The FBI's files also contain memoranda regarding

telephone calls and personal contacts the FBI has had with

Congressmen and Senators regarding the above-cited variety

of matters.

Miscellaneous Information About Congressmen

(9) An unknown number of FBI files contain informa-

tion reflecting favorably or unfavorably upon the character,

integrity, and loyalty of Senators and Congressmen--which

information does not require investigative action at the time

received on the part of the FBI or other law enforcement

• agencies. It consists of:

(a) Information contained in unsolicited letters

received by the FBI from persons and organi-

viewpoints, and walks of life.

(b)

Information volunteered orally to FBI Agents by

Fingerprints of Congressmen

(10 )

The files of the Identification Division

contain the fingerprints of an unknown number of Senators

and Congressmen.

Some of these relate to their having been

arrested for violations of Federal, state, or local laws.

Others are noncriminal in origin and largely pertain to

their having served in the Armed Forces or having been appli-

cants for various positions. These fingerprint cards have

been submitted to the FBI by Federal agencies, as well as by

local, county, and state criminal justice agencies, throughout

the United States.

Fingerprint records are maintained by the FBI's

Identification Division, and they are kept entirely separate

and apart from all other files and records of the FBI.

HOW INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN REACHES FBI FILES:

There are two basic types of information regarding

Congressmen and Senators in FBI

files:

(1) Information which the FBI has solicited during

investigations involving the Congressman or Senator as either

a subject or a victim.

This includes information of

pertinence to the case which the lawmaker himself has

furnished to the FBI.

(2) Unsolicited Information.

there are many sources of the unsolicited information

that is included in FBI files:

(a)

It is volunteered by citizens who are being

interviewed during investigations of matters

having no relationship to any of our Nation's

lawmakers.

(b)

It is volunteered in communications sent to the

FBI by individuals and organizations.

(c)

It is included in news articles and

other reports

publicly disseminated by our Nation's news media

which come to the FBI's attention.

(2)

It is received from FBI confidential informants

and, very infrequently, from telephone taps not

directed at a Congressman which have been

installed with authority of a Federal Court

and/or authority of the Attorney General.

- 5 -

55108

DocId: 32989624 Page 212

---

## Page 213

(e) In the case of information contained on finger-

print cards, it is sent to the FBI's Identifica-

tion Division by authorized contributors,

including criminal justice agencies throughout

the United States.

HOW AND WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN IS MAINTAINED:

Information regarding Congressmen anâ Senators is

included in the official FBI files--totaling more than

6,500,000 in number--that are maintained by the Files and

Communications Division on an upper floor of the J. Edgar

Hoover FBI Building.

The area where these files are maintained is staffed

and supervised 24 hours a day, Y days a week, to assure

continuous security.

General Index

The essential key to the effective use of these FBI

files is the Bureau's General Index which consists of 58

million index cards and which is located on a different floor

from the files themselves in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building.

To determine what files (if any at all) contain information

regarding an individual Senator or Congressman, it is

necessary to search the name of that lawmaker in the General

Index.

The General Index is staffed and supervised 24 hours

a day, 7 days a week, to assure continuous security.

Rules Governing Use of Files

These official FBI files are available only to FBI

personnel--and they are available on a "need-to-know" basis

only.

The Files and Communications Division maintains a

record of files that have been charged out by Headquarters

personnel.

Such files must be returned to the Files and

Communications Division as soon as possible; and during the

period that a file is chaiged out, it cannot be left even

momentarily in an unlocked room.

If retained overnight,

the file must be kept in a locked cabinet inside a locked

room.

HH 55108 DocId:32989624 Page 213

---

## Page 214

The charge-out record is temporary in nature and

is destroyed five days after the file has been returned to

the Files and Communications

Division.

WHY THE FBI RETAINS INFORMATION REGARDING CONGRESSMEN:

The information regarding Congressmen and Senators

that is maintained in FBI files can be divided into three

major categories:

(1) The results of investigations (criminal-,

security, and applicant-type) involving a Congressman or

Senator as a subject or victim;

(2) Information regarding a Congressman or senator--

in addition to that gathered during investigation(s) of the

lawmaker involved--which the FBI has disseminated to other

set 222c

Federal agencies (such as to the Internal Revenue Service if, for

example, the information involves a tax-related matter) and/or to

state and local law enforcement agencies (such as the police

department covering the lawmaker's home community if, for example,

the information involves an alleged threat against the lawmaker's

house or other property; and

(3), Other information that. the FBi receives from,

or receives about, a Congressman or Senator that is included

in the FBI's files--without having been either investigated

or disseminated by the FBI.

The reasons this information is retained in FBI

files can be explained in legal and administrative terms,

as well as in practical terms.

Legal and Administrative Reasons

All investigative files and other records of the

FBI involving Congressmen.or Senators are within a class

of records which--under the FBI Records Retention Plan

developed in 1969 by the National Archives and Records

Service of the General Services Administration are con-

sidered of enduring archival value to ensure their preser-

vation.

This FBI Records Retention Plan was prepared under

the authority contained in the Federal Records Act of 1950,

which is contained in Title 44 of the United States Code.'

NH 55108 DocId: 32989624 Page 214

## Page 215

Included among the FBI records to be retained

under the Records Retention Plan formulated by the National

Archives and Krcords Service are those which would have

historical value and would document policies, procedures,

functions, legislative and budget matters, and the like--

and reports of investigations of both civil and criminai

activities, including "crimes involving,

and other recoras,

concerning, the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the

United States, members of and delegates elected to the

Congresses of

the United States, cabinet heads, judges and

other officials appointed by the President."

In stablishing the FBI Records Retention Plan,

the National Archives and Records Service noted, "Ordinarily

the records of a Federal agency that are worthy of permanent

retention amount to a sather small percentage of the total

volume of records generated.

Many of the records produced

by the Federal. Bureau of Investigation, however, relate to

a number of controversial if not important aspects of the

history of the United States, particularly to the role of

the Federal Government in its relation to its citizens.

To be sure,

many years will pass before these records can

be made available to the public for historical and other

sérious research. Nevertheless, the archival value of these

records will lut decrease nor will interest in them dissipate."

In addition, the FBI is also required by the

Fedecal Records Act 'to make records containing adequate and

proper documentation of its administration and operations

which, among other things, are designed to furnish informa-

tion necessary to protect the legal and financial interest

of the Governont and of persons directly affected by FBI

activities.

Practival Reasons for Retaining Information

Logic, reason, and lessons learned from more than

six decades o! law enforcement experience dictate that the

FBI should maintain records of investigations it has conductea

(category #I cited at the top of page 7) and records of

information it has disseminated to other agencies (category #2

on page 7).

Such records enable the FBI to answer questions or

challenges (including those arising in judicial or administra-

tive proceedins) involving investigations FBI Agents have

conducted and,r information the FBI has disseminated to other

HH 55108 DooId:32989624 Page 215

---

## Page 216

agencies.

Such records also enable the FBI to furnish additional

copies of investigative reports or other information that has

been disseminated--should additional copies be needed by the

original recipients or by other official agencies.

Furthermore,

the information contained in these files often proves of

assistance in future investigations.

Less obvious may be the reasons why the FBI retains

the third category of information about Congressmen and

Senators (data that has neither been investigated nor

disseminated by the FBI) cited on page 7.

If such information is of an administrative nature--

that is, if the information indicates the lawmaker is interested

in a specific FBI investigation, a specific area of the FBI's

jurisdiction, or specific FBI policies, practices anã procedures--

it is filed for:

(1) the information and advice of FBI employees in

connection with future contacts or correspondence with that

Congressman or Senator;

(2) consideration "of FBI personnel in connection

with possible future changes in FBI policies, practices, and

procedures.

If the information is of a personal nature--that is,

if it reflects upon the loyalty, character, or integrity of a

lawmaker--it is included in FBI files for the foliowing reasons:

(1) The information may prove of value when

present or former Congressman or Senator is considered for

a position in the Executive or Judicial Branch of Government

which requires that the FBI conduct a background investiga-

tion of him.

(2) The information could prove of value in

solving future crimes committed against the Congressman or

Senator-or against members of that lawmaker's family.

(A person who berates and defames a lawmaker would be a

logical suspect if that lawmaker--or another Congressman

or senator whose

views coincide with his--becomes the

target of actual or threatened violence.)

(3) The information could aid the FBI in solving

crimes committed against other persons. (For example, the

handwriting, typewriting, stationery, and/or distinctive

- 9-

HH 55108 DocId:32989624 Page 216

---

## Page 217

phraseology in a letter defaming a Congressman could assist

the FBI in linking the writer of that letter to a subsequent

extortion note or written bomb threat that does not involve

any member of Congress.)

(4) The information frequently provides valuable.

insight into the character, stability, and reliability of

the person who has furnished it to the FBI. Thereby, it is

of value and assistance to the FBI in future contacts with,

contacts by, or inquiries regarding, this individual.

(5) The information provides a useful administra-

tive check on the performance of FBI field offices--

particularly with regard to the important consideration of

whether they are being fully responsive to the public needs.

Supervisory personnel regularly review complaints or

allegations received from the public to insure that the

appropriate action was taker--if, in fact, action was called

for.

WHAT IS REQUIRED TO DESTROY FILE INFORMATION:

Barring a new law of Congress and/or receipt of a

revised FBI Records Retention Plan from the National Archives

and Records Service, the FBI cannot unilaterally undertake

the destruction of information regarding Congressmen and

Senators in its files.

This memorandum recommends that the Director raise the

question of privacy and source protection with Senators of the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) on the occasion of his anticipated

meeting in Executive Session with the SSC tentatively scheduled)

for the week of 7/14/75.

By letter dated 7/9/75, Senators Frank, Church and

John Tower of SSC requested the Attorney General and the

Director to appear before the Committee in Executive Session

during the week of 7/14/75.

The purpose of this meeting is

t

discuss the matter of concern to Mr. Kelley and steps which

might be taken to expedite the response to requests for documentsy

essential to the Committee inquiry.

The Senstudy staff of the Intelligence Division is

response to each request; the date it was delivered to the

Department; and the date it was delivered to the SSC staff.

There remains, however, a serious problem precipitated

by three recent written

requests

of the SSC dated 6/30/75 (received

by the Bureau on 7/7/75); 7/1/75 (received by the Bureau on

7/8/75); and 7/8/75 (received by the FBI on 7/9/75). All three

of these requests appear, in part,

to disregard the privacy of

certain individuals or requests

the identity of sources

cooperating with the FBI.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY '75

322223

In this regard, in an exchange of letters dated

Colby in his role as the Director

of Central Intelligencé, wrote to Senator Church stating.

that "I am particularly appreciative of your recognition

that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence activities

must receive special consideration and treatment by the Select

Committee in the course of your work.

As we discussed, such

matters as the identities oi our sensitive sources...

should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed iron

the risk of exposure. We should

also work

together to protect

certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,

might impair the privacy rights

of the individuals."

By letter dated 3/12/75, Senator Church stated as

follows, "It is the Committee's understanding that the members

of the Committee and designated staff will have access to any

or all information which the Committee deems necessary for its

inquiry.

We recognize, however, that the Committee inquiry

may touch on sensitive areas, such as the identities of CIA

personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations whose

disclosure could place persóns in actual jeopardy. In the

event that the Committee inquiry touches on such sensitive

areas, which matters we have already discussed in our meeting

of February 27, we should discuss jointly, and as you suggested

quickly, what procedures might be followed should the Committee

decide it requires more information in these specific areas."

The 6/30/75 SSC letter requests among other things,

a LIst oI all police departments and personnel contacted

relative to a particular COINTELPRO operation; a list of all

media persons contacted in relation to this COINTELPRO and

The 7/1/75 SSC letter requests a list of all persons

relatives, friendly media personnel, members of clergy,

federal, state and local law enforcement and other officials)

COINTELPRO operations.

This same letter also notes that one

Morris Starsky, one of the four persons referred to above,

was made known

made to no die contary no one va dord

to the FBI during a conference on 6/12/75,

as

a person who would be the subject of a case study by the ssc.

This is not so. Inquiry was made of those Bureau supervisors

who attended the conference and a review of the memorandum

written

following the conference was made. Neither the

memorandum nor the recollection of Bureau

supervisors attending

the conferencé indicates the name Morris Starsky was mentioned

by SSC staff personnel.

The 7/8/75 SSC letter requests among other things:

(1) all memoranda and other materials which relate to a meeting

between

the President and Roy Wilkins, A. Philip Randolph,

Whitney Young, Mrs. Dorothy Haight, James Farmer and Jack

Greenberg on 11/19/64; (2) a copy of a November, 1964, telegram

from Dr. Martin Luther King, JI., to Director Hoover and all

notes, memoranda, and any other materials reflecting the

disposition of, or actions taken as a result of the receipt

of, said telegram; (3) all memoranda and other materials which

relate to a meeting between the President and Dr. King on

2/9/65; (4) all other materials which relate to the transfer of

former Special Agent Robert C. Nichols to the Oklahoma Office of

the FBI in June, 1969; (5) all forms and attachments including

forms entitled "Performance Rating Guide For Investigative

Personnel," from 1959 until retirement for former Special

Agents Robert C. Nichols and Alan Sentinella.

OBSERVATION:

It would appear the above-cited requests do, in tact,

violate the privacy of individuals and possibly place in jeopardy

the identity of persons who cooperated with the FBI. Consistent

with the agreement in the exchange of letters between Colby and

Church dated 3/11 and 12/75, it is believed the Director should

raise these questions with the SSC and attempt to get relief

from the requirement of revealing the names of FBI sources or

violating the privacy of individuals.

Certainly the request for

information on former Special Agents

Nichols and Sentinella goes

to the heart of the privacy issue and appears to be a blatant

disregard for their privacy.

Reference is made to the Attorney General's letter,

July 16, 1975, captioned as above, requesting information

relating to the collection, analysis, use, and dissemination

of organized crime intelligence.

On June 25, 1974, the Director testified before

the FBI Oversight Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary•

Committee that the Bureau has "no statutory authority to

collect intelligence per se" but that it operates under the

general umbrella of 28 U.S.C. 533 (3), which authorizes the

melta of no.5

Attorney General to appoint

officials

"to conduct...investiga-

tions regarding official matters...as may be directed by the

Attorney General." A listing of

any directives issued by

the Department or the Attorney General with respect to organized

crime should be available in the office of the Assistant

Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice.

With respect to the FBI, all our investigations in

the organized crime field are aimed

one ultimate objective:

prosecution.

During the course of our

hoodlums and the various criminal syndicates operating through-

out the United States, we naturally acquire considerable data

regarding the structure of the organized underworld, the

identities of its principal leaders, the extent of its in-

fluence, its primary sources of income, its payoffs to corrupt

officials, and the operations of its vast communications networks.

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland

Re:

United States Senate Select Committee

To Study Governmental Operations With

Respect to Intelligence Activities

Most of this information is obtained from paid

informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert

citizens, and from court-approved electronic surveillances

installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus

court proved an

•Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

None of it, however, is intelligence for intelligence's

sake.

The experience of the FBI over the years has shown that

criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting

illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may

reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these

activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized

underworld

data but at establishing which criminal violations its members

are engaged in and then proving these violations in a court

of law.

Obviously, not every case opened, every lead followed,

or every bit of information received is going to wind up in

Federal court.

On the contrary, much of this material relates

to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the

FBl. When such is the case, we immediately disseminate the

intormatIon to the appropriate federal, state, or local agency.

As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past

five years

alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make

Pursuant to a request from SA Thomas J. McNiff

SA Daly of this Division contacted Michael Shaheen, Deputy Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination for the Department, on 7-22-75

concerning the current policy regarding excisions which may properly

be made on documents being furnished to the Senate Select Committee

for their review in Bureau space and the policy concerning notes being

taken during the Committee staffers review of such materials.

Shaheen stated that there is no agreement currently in

operation concerning excisions, however, he felt that excisions should

or methods concerning sensitive ongoing operations. He noted that this

is in general conformity with the proposed agreement concerning this matter

which was being reviewed at the White House. Regarding the question

raised concerning the taking of notes, Shaheen indicated that the proposed

new agreement allowed for the taking of notes on these documents which

notes may be taken to the Senate Select Committee offices. In fact,

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, K. William O'Connor, who

was present during this discussion pointed out it was the intent of the

aforementioned proposed agreement that "screened documents" may be

removed by the Committee staff members to the Senate Select Committee

offices. With this in mind, Shaheen stated we should allow the staff

members to take notes and remove same to their rices. loc

In response to a Senate Select Committee request for

guide lines utilized by the Inspection Divisi on, memorandum

H. N. Bassett to W. R. Wannall dated 6/2/75, captioned as above,

noted there would be no objection to a review of the Handbooks

for Headquarters and field office inspections by Committee Staff

members provided the review was conducted in FBI space with an

Inspection Division representative present.

On 7/8/75 Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Select Committee Staff

reviewed the FBIHQ Inspection Manual in the presence of SA

Fred B. Griffith. Mr. Gitenstein was specifically advised these

Manuals are used solely as guidelines for the Inspection Staff and

are not binding on anyone but staff members. They cannot be used

to document any deficiencies noted during an inspection. He was told

such action would have to be based on applicable provisions in either

the Manual of Instructions or the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

During the review it was noted Mr. Gitenstein made notes regarding

the following Sections:

1. Section 2 (Recording the Inspection Findings), pages 5 and 6

which deal with the assembly and distribution of inspection reports and

work papers.

2. Section 4 (Specific Division Operations), pages 4 and 5 which are

concerned with surveys and audits.

REC

111-

3. Section 8 (Inspector's Summaries), pages 1, 2 and 4 which deal

with the summary for the Director, the letter to the Division Head from

the Director and personnel write-ups.

Mir. Gitenstein stated he would return at a later date to review indis

field manual.

ACTION: None. .

At 11:40 a.m. on July 18, 1975, K. William O'Connor,

Special Counsel in the Deputy Attorney General's Office, telephonically

advised me that his negotiations with the Committee concerning more

restrictive limitations on Committee access to witnesses were not

successful. He said that the Department has determined that the

procedure in effect previously whereby the FBI Director would receive

a request for the availability of FBI personnel for interview and would

determine whether such personnel should be released from applicable

"secrecy agreements would be reinstituted.

I asked Mr. O'Connor whether this meant that the Department

no longer regarded all requests for interview of present or former employees

as "demand" situations requiring the specific authorization of the Department

as if a subpoena had been issued. Mr. O'Connor said that the Department

would not consider such requests in that manner and that the FBI should

make all determinations necessary for the appearance of witnesses for

interview.

Diractor Sac'y -

At 5:14 p.m., on 6/27/75, K. William O'Connor, Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, advised me that he had received

a call from John Elliff of the Senate Select Committee complaining of

what he described as an attempt to interferewith the Committee's investi-

gation by supplying information to the press that the Committee had been

furnished material which it had declined to use or to inquire into because

of its sensitive nature. O'Connor said that Elliff claimed that a journalist

who is friendly with the Committee had advised the Committee that he had

information from a Justice Department official that the Committee had been

furnished information originating in the FBI that Communist funds were

used to finance Martin Luther King; that King had been related to the CP, USA,

and that the Senate Select Committee had treated this matter as a "hot potato"

and that the information also indicated that "King laughed all the way to the

bank."

O'Connor said that Elliff protested the apparent disclosures

by the Justice Department to the press and claimed that it appeared an

effort was being made to interferewith the Committee's work. O'Connor

told Elliff he had no knowledge of anyone in the Justice Department furnishing

any such information to the press and further, he told him that he did not

believe that information concerning CP funding of King had been furnished

to the Committee.

ST-101 REC-18

62.116515-

O'Connor said that he did not believe that the FEr had furnished

such information to the news media but he wanted us to«be aware of Elliff's

complaint. O'Connor said that it is possible that during interviews conducted

by staff of the Committee, they have received statements indicating that

Communist funds were used by King, but he does not believe that any docu-

mentation of that has been furnished to the Committee as yet.

INTD has received no report or has any information

concerning the alleged leak referred to in this memorandum.

Concerning t. the allegation in this memorandum

that information originated with the FBI that communist

funds were used to finance Martin Luther King, Jr., and that

King had been "related" to the CPUSA, the following is noted.

We have never had any information that communist funds,

literally, were used to finance King. We did have reliable

reports that King was helped in a financial way, particularly

as to advice regarding fund raising, by a close advisor,

Stanley David Levison, who was a secret member of the CPUSA.

However, none of our reports are known to have claimed that

"communist funds" were financing King. King was never known

to have been a member of the CPUSA. It is true that he had

a number of close associates such as Levison who at the time

were either current or past CPUSA members.

INID is unable to pinpoint the report that "Ring

laughed all the way to the bank."
