December 1963..

There had been indications that Small's shop served

as a message center for visiting communists from the US and Small was

very worried following publication of the facts

concerning Oswald's

leftist tendencies.

He carried with him information showing that

he was in the US at the time of Oswald's visit to Mexico, but he was

fearful that he might have known Oswald or that Oswald might have visited

his shop and that he would be questioned or arrested by Mexican

authorities in connection with the matter.

As of May 21, 1964 no

information had been developed which would indicate that

Oswald had

visited Small's place of business or had contacted Small in any way.
