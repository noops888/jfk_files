1.

Teresa Proenza Proenza, Cultural Attache at

the Cuban Embassy in

Mexico City,

was dismissed from her job

a result of an open

cable received from Raul Roa Garcia, Cuban Foreign Minister rought

about 10 or 12 December 1963.

The dismissal was evidently

on by a remark Proenza made to the sister-in-law of Roa to the

effect that Roa's strong note to the Mexican Government regarding

ce detention of Silvia Duran was a diplomatic error.

3.

Proenza,

who appeared to be greatly disturbed, attributed her

dismissal to the fact that she was a Communist and Roa was not.

Proenza visited General Heriberto Jara in Veracruz to plead her

case and reported subsequently that Jara was furious at the

"injustice."

On 24 December Proenza made a brief appearance at

an Embassy

dinner, slightly drunk,

and said that she had just

come from a visit with General Lázaro Cárdenas.

The fact of her

dismissal was known to the Embassy personnel,.

but it was not being

In late December:

Proenza continued to show up at the

Embassy almost daily, staying for only a few minutes.

On 15 January 1964 a one-way ticket to Cuba for Proenza was re-

ceived by the Cubana Airlines office in Mexico City.

Apparentiy

having just returned from a vacation, Proenza spoke

with Joaquin

Hernandez Armas, Cuban Ambassador, on the evening of 15 January

and told him that she would be prepared to travel on 20 January;

the Ambassador approved her departure date.
