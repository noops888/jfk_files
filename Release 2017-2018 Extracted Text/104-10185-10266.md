2. Ing reported that on the afternoon of do ton he a cas

prised to reccive this call but told 1-3 to "cone over here now if yeu want

to."

A-3 said he thought

It would bo better for the tro to meet at the bar

of the Del Prado Hotel at about 1800 on 18 lov. Lay asked 3 for Instructions.

B said that in view of the

nossibility that i g!on phone night be tapped

or that A-3 might let word leak out that he lad cartacted I-9,

Ing should in

form Imbassador Hernandez imas of the call - It as vreed that 3 kould con-

sit further on

this matter and that the final decision sould be relayed to him

on the evening of 17 November - L-9 would call Bis hore and 9, in a short con

versation would use the word Acapulco if the incident should be reported

Faratlan If not. (19 called as scheduled and the word Acapuleo as used).

Im? was advised to keep away from A-3 who was believed to be in bown in

cornection with his efforts to get his relatives out of Cuba. He was told not

to no to the lel Prado Monday night unless Armas insisted that he do so. He

whould make every effort

to avoid any encounter with i-3 - staying avay from

SUBJECT & Meeting with LITAtL-9, 26 October 1963

A meeting

was held with Ing from 2000 to 2135 hourg in Big car

(parked in Tacuba) on 26 October.

2. I-9 reported as follows:

A few days earlier Coty SOLORZAO, sister-in-law of General

Lazaro CARNAS, told 1-9 with a groan of disgust that it lcoks

11ke DIAZ Ordaz has been chosen as the PRI presidential candidate.

bo

The Ambassador is still using the wall safe built into the chimney

of his offica (we have photos of this in our files), L-9 thinks

that the Erbassy payroll is kept there as the other day when he

walked into the Ambassador's office he saw the Ambassador shut the

safe door - Dra. MACHIDO. was there, having just returned from the

bank where she withdrew the payroll. Dra NACHADO handies the

payroll for the whole Erbassy.

In the old days, before CASTRO, MIRABAL worked for

the Sherwin Wililans paint factory (L9 thinks Sw in the States

must have a record on him) which was located a short distance from

the plant nined by Ingle father.

1o Dra. "MONDO recently told In9 thatxenA was discourteous to her

when she first, arrived here but that he has softened up a bit re

cently and now seems to "accept" her.

She thinks this may be

because she lost two sons in the Revolution (no details given).

She complained that LINGOSTERA still doesn't accept her but JURRIN

seems to be coring around. (This may ba the usual resentment caused

by a female in a responsiole executive position)

Embassy staff mentings arc held every Saturday morning from 0900 on

= usually lasting about two hours.

"theater" out back under the new constructicn but are now being held

at night so that afterwaris evoryone could get together for

dinner. RUIs of the comercial office took exception to this

— said that the result would be just like the Rotary Club,

Ambassador HERNANDEr Amas supported I-g's proposal but did

not press for aproval and the decision was made to continua

staff mecting that he was taken

to task by a Mexican senator who asked him why Cuba refused to

sign the aton test ban pact.

Aris (he, like ROA, 15 known by

his matronynic) tried to explain that Cuba could never sign the

apresent as long as she is the subject of Merican agression.

ARMIS said that Embassy stuff people should be prepared to answer

"such questions and mentionod tiat a request was being sent to

Havana to allow the expenditure of sufficient funds to print up

10,000 coples of Fidel CISTRO's speech of 28 September to be

"line" on the test ban issue.

who, like many artists, nay be just a bit wacky.

The meeting lasted vatil nidnight when I was

8. Victor TRAPOTE Mateos - This ran's most interesting operational

access. 1s. through his daughter, Irina TRIPOTE de VALDES, who 1s married

to Raniro VALDES.

The prospective fruitfulness of this entree diminishes,

however,

as the facts are laid on the table.

For one thing, though anti

Comunist, TRAPOTE 13 still a friend of Fidel Castro. Ig said that be

shelterdd Fidel in his home during Fidel's exile in Medco.

TRAPCTE, who

was born in Spain, 13 about 58 and apparently more interested in his art

(sculpturing) than in politics.. TRAYIS arparently has no intention of

going to Cuba permanently. L9 says TRATTE bas made np comment concerning .

Pariro VALDES, but he apparently has sugrested that Irina 1s not getting

along well with Raniro. I9 described TRuME as of medius beight,

solidly built, and in good physical conditior. His daughter 13 a tall

attractive blonde of about 25, and has a rather retiring personality.

In, could come up with no means of developing an operation against VALDES

through these entrees.

Attachnent A

I ai

'In coopliance with DIR-40146, Edward D. Knapman was dispatched

to Mexico CIty from JIAVE to conduct a debriefing of LITAMIL-9. Knapman

arrived here 29 May 1963 and conducted the debriefing at three sessions

totaling eight hours on the nights of 29 May, 31 May and 1 June 1963.

2.

Attachment B 1s largely positive, intelligence while Attachment C.

1s basically of operational interest.

The intelligence debriefirg was

conducted on the basis of current and past intelligence requirements lists

avallable at the Mexico Station.

To the extent feasible we attempted to

pinpoint ultimate sources, but headquarters will note that a sizable part of

the information provided was based on personal observation and impressions.

icadquarters should keep in mind that I-g's perimeter of access was the city

of Habara and that he was exposed principally to bureaucrats who are identified

with the regime. We caution headquarters on this rather obvious point, per-

haps because ne

were exposed recently to AMKNOCK-1 who has been living deep

"In the entrails of the monster" in Oriente and who had a different view of

the temper of the people in that area fron that given by ItAMily for .

Havana.

3.

In attachment C are the answers to a series of questions of operational

interest which were posed after a thorough review of the LITA'JI-g operational

file.

In some cases fuller biographic information can be dotained from L-9

If and when required.

I-9 was most cooperative and understood clearly what

the debriefer was looking for.

In most cases, however, it is not probable

that I-9 will be of great help in making operational approaches and pitches

With regard to internal friction within the GOC, he said that

Joaquin ORDOQUI and Nicolas GUILLEN (previously, reported) as cases in point.

By and large, the new Communists and Fidelistas are grabbing off most key

leader of the Revolution and both the PSP and the Soviets know that he is

vitally important to them.

8. Source ras questioned about Chicón military activities. He

answered that he say ho Chinese, heard no comments äbout the Chinese

and did not set the Impression that the Chicoms are significantly active in

any fleld in Caba..

When assed about Cuban Confidence.in the Soviets, he said that most

people he had tied to felt that the Soviets would cout to Cuba's defense ta

case of an American invasion if it happened to suit Soviet interests at the

time." He said that to his knowledge Soviet technicians were getting along

well with cubans, but he feels that the Cuban people view the Soviet with

detachnient socially: and have very little to do with them.

10.

Source was queried on any comments he had heard concerning a

GOC desire for a rapproachement with the United States.

He said that

he had heard nothing specific, but that he personally felt this was a

prospect frequen ly considered by Castro.

11. In view of Sources excellent sub-source in INFA (Conchita), it had

• been hoped that be nould be able to provide some valuable information on

this organization.

Actually, he had little to add to Conchita's comments in

regard to Fidel's attitude toward Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

We asked for

Conchita's evaluation of Carlos Rafael, and received information which has

many times been forwarded to headquarters and need not be repeated here.

Conchita made no seaningful comments on the effectiveness of Soviet and

Satellite technicians assigned to INRA.

(See also paragraph 5 of attachment

B concerning Fidel Castro which may be of PI interest.)

12.

When esied about the principal reasons for industrial difficulties,

Source

said that he heard universal complaints about the need for spare parts.

He could only pinpoint the transport incustry. He had no specific information

on how some U.s. manufactured spare parts were being received, but commented

that Canada might be the source. He could give no specifies and said that

all correspondence on these matters is closely. held and encoded when cabled.

He has had no access to such inforration.

13.

Regarding the rationing systen, he said that it 1s working more

smoothly now than a year ago and that grumbling is less now than in the

past. He said that things are better organized now and that he saw no desper-

ation because of food or other shortages.

• 14, Source said that he had heard of no significant increase in diseases,

though there was rich coment about cases of gestroenteritis.

Source hai no information whatever on the export of the Cuban

Revolution are i no rators of whatever arles com oter the un Cuba.

16. Regarding diploratic relations with other Latin American countrie:

With regard. to the Civil. and. Foreign Services, Source said that

there •13

more stability and discipline in both than there was a year. ago,

with a consequent rise in morale.. He said that there is mich less free-

wheeling on the part of subordinates, but now the chiefs are expected to face

up to

their responsibilities and the competent must carry the load for the

majority who are incompetents.

We commented that this was not a phenomenon

absent in other public services and tried to flush Source out on the quality,

loyalty, and efficiency of the services.

He said that loyalty 1s Increasing,

quality is circumscribed seriously by insufficient academic preparation and

Job training and efficiency has increased in the past year because of better

discipline and improved administrative practices.

Subject had nothing of consequence to add regarding the organization

of the Ministry of Foreign Relation and the Foreign Service.

This subject

will be covered to some extent in the operational attachment to this dispatch.

See paragraph 7 of attachment B concerning the rumor that Armando WHART will

replace Raul ROA at MINREX.

Source had little information on

the Church. He said that the

Catholic Church is not being molested and that relations between it and

the Goe have improved.. Pope John sulll was viewed with favor by the coc.

Batistianos in Miami frequently take che opposite view.)

Source had nothing of value on the Ministry of Education, the

University of Habana, the literacy program, the establishment of new technical

and scientific institutes, the quality of education at secondary and primary

21. Regarding the United States, he feels that there is still a furd

of friendship among the Cuban people and admiration of american technology.

He said that a few of his friends listen to U,S, broadmasts, but he had

Regarding the temper o? the Cuban people, source does not belleve
