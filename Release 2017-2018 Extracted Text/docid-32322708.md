Title: ASSASSINATION MATERIAL DISCLOSURE ACT

Synopsis: JFK Task Force returning original file(s) to Dallas.

Details: Enclosed for Dallas are the following original file(s) :

DL 137-976

DI 137-1020

DL 137-440

DL 100-9734 Volume 3 & 4

The originals removed from these files and replaced with

duplicate copies of the original

were accessioned to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to the JEK

Records Collection Act of 1992.

Provision of the JFK Act allowed for

certain information to be postponed from public release until the

Year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOI necessarily been released

public review in

their entirety.

Under the JEK Act, originals to all material deemed

assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of

whether the material is open in full or released with information

postponed.

Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files

accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer considered

the possession of the FBI.

The duplicate pages have been inserted

strictly for research purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned

file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date classification.
