on March 2, 1964, by an acquaintance who wished to discuss a

plan to assassinate FIDEL CASTRO. This acquaintance was

described as a businessman, a ship owner, who owns at least

one ship which sails under the British flag. This acquaintance

allegedly has some contact with elements in the underworld

primarily through his partner, who is a former police officer

from St. Louis

and through him there is a tie-in with elements

of "Cosa Nostra". Since the offer was to assassinate CASTRO for

$150,000.00, the Cuban exile first approached told acquaintance

he was not interested and sugjested an approach be made with

someone with more money.

CUBAN GOVERNMENT LEADERS

CuRA

Company, Ltd., Fort Lauderdale, Florida, met on March 3, 1964,

During the conversation at this meeting, CAMERON allegedly

nentioned that he was in contact with an unidentified group

which would be willing to assassinate certain Cuban officials

for cash. The three principal leaders, FIDEL and RAUL CASTRO

and ERNESTO "CHE" GUEVARA were the ones named.

It was felt that the $150,000.00 to assassinate

FIDEL CASTO plus $5000.00 expense money was too high.

Another meeting allegedly was held on March 5

and a counter offer of $100,000.00 was made to assassinate

FIDEL CASTRO.

Still another meeting was allegedly held on March 15

by CAMERON, BABUN and his associates where the following prices

were agreed upon:

$100,000.00 to k111 FIDEL CASTRO

$20,000.00 for RAUL

$20,000.00 for "CHE" GUEVARA

plus $2500.00 for expenses, payable in advance. Allegedly a

contract was made for the payment of this money.

In April 1964, ELISEO GOMEZ FERNANDEZ met with JOSE

"PEPIN"| BOSCH, and BOSCH agreed to advance $100,000.00 and BABUN

and his associates would advance the $2500.00 for expenses.

Allegedly, JULIO, LOBO-OLAVARRIA, a wealthy Cuban exile of New

York, subseguently agreed to the terms provided his name was not

Involved. The last news was that CAMERON reported that his group

had already called its man in Cuba and they had received

information that good news was expected between May 20 and May 25,

1964. Allegedly LOBO was to fly to Miami on May 19 to arrange

for the transfer of $100.000.CO to a safety deposit box, keys

to which would be held jointly by CAMERON and a person in the

confidence of LOBO.

Still another Cuban exile who allegedly spoke with

JOSE "PEPIN" BOSCH, reported in late May 1964, that TEOFILO

BABUN and ELISEO GOMEZ had a plan underway to assassinate

FIDEL CASTRO and $50,000.00 of the $150,000.00 required was to

be paid by BOSCH.

BABUN specifically denied any involvement in, or

knowledge of, any plan to assassinate selected Cuban Government

officials.

He stated he had not paid, nor had he offered to

pay any sum of money to anyone for the

purpose of effecting

the assassination of FIDEL CASTRO or of any other Cuban Government

official. He also denied that he had been a party to any

meetings with his associates and BYRON CAMERON, or with any

other individuals, for the purpose of discussing ways and means

to assassinate FIDEL CASTRO.

He stated BYRON CAMERON is the owner and operator

of the motor vessel "Cayman Hope" which plies between Miami,

Grand Cayman Island, Montego Bay, Jamaica, and British

Honduras. He stated his only connection with CAMERON is to

furnish him warehouse facilities for his cargo at Miami at

the regular price of $1.50 per ton.

BABUN stated that as

a matter of fact, even this relationship might not be continued in-

asmuch as a $1.50 per ton is for cargo which is bound together

In large boxes or bundles which can be handled quickly and

easily, whereas the cargo of CAMERON,which consists almost

entirely of groceries and foodstuffs, are in many small packages

and boxes which are very time-consuming to place in and remove

from the warehouse.

BABUN stated that insofar as he knows, CAMERON is

not interested in any anti-CASTRO plot, but he has certainly

never discussed any slot with CAMERON and certainly no plan

to assassinate any Cuban Government leaders.

He stated he

never mentioned such a matter to CAMERON and CAMERON never

approached him or his associates with any plan to assassinate

Cuban leaders.

BABUN stated he never knew anything concerning

CAMERON's personal background and associates other than

those business associates directly concerned with the

shipping

business.

BABUN stated CAMERON goes from Miami to Grand

Cayman Island off the south coast of Cuba and delivers

foodstuffs to an hotel at Grand Cayman Island as well as

hotels in Montego Bay, Jamaica.

BABUN indicated at that time

that his warehouse is

full of Official League baseballs

and Official League softballs as well as chicken coops

brought back by CAMERON from Jamaica. BABUN denied knowing

anyone connected with the hoodlum element, either in the

United States or elsewhere, who is sponsoring or participating

in any plot to assassinate

selected Cuban Governnent leaders.

He denied knowing anyone from St. Louis, Chicago, or any other

place, who has hoodlum contacts and who is in contact with

BYRON CAMERON.

He is acquainted with JULIO LOBO, a wealthy former

Cuban businessman who controlled better than fifty percent

of the Cuban sugar interests, and who now resides in New York.

During a trip to New York approximately three months ago which

BABUN and his wife made to visit a member of their family,

he talked with LOBO briefly at the "Sugar Exchange Building

In downtown New York". The only discussion concerning anti-CASTRO

Cuban plans had to do with the possibility of securing bases in the

Dominican Republic from which anti-CASTRO activities might be carried

out against the CASTRO Government.

There was no mention of any plot

or plan to assassinate Cuban Government officials.

He noted that over the past years since FIDEL CASTRO

has come into power that at any time Cuban refugees discuss the

possibility of overthrowing the CASTRO regime, there is someone

who will vehemently state that it would "be a

great thing if someone

would kill the CASTRO brothers and other Cuban Communist leaders"

but he stated that insofar as he knew, these statements had never

been more than the venting of expressions of hatred for the CASTRO

regime and he had never met a man with any specific plan to actually

put into effect an assassination plot.

Interview of ELISEO GOMEZ FERNANDEZ

ELISEO GOMEZ FERNANDEZ was interviewed by Special Agents

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation separately, and immediately

following

the interview of TEOFILO" BABUN SELMAN, at which time

he furnished the following information:

GOMEZ stated he is an associate of TEOFILO BABUN SELMAN

in the operation of the above-named Antillean Marine Shipping

Corporation at Miami, and is an associate of CEFERINO OSCAR FERNANDEZ

denied knowledge of the existence of any such plan. He

admitted knowing BYRON CAMERON and admitted handling the

warehouse operations in Miami for CAMERON who owns and

operates the motor vessel "Cayman Hope". He indicated the

sane route described above, on a map on his office wall

of the "Cayman Hope" and the ports at which it calls.

He likewise indicated, and voluntarily showed interviewing

Special Agents, that a good portion of his warehouse was

at that time occupied with large boxes containing Official

League baseballs, Official League softballs and empty chicken

crates made in Jamaica. He likewise indicated that the

warehousing and handling of the groceries and foodstuffs

for CAMERON are unsatisfactory inasmuch as the payment of

$1.50 per ton is not sufficient to cover the labor cost

Involved in handling so many small loose packages and

boxes and the company has agreed to advise CAMERON that

further shipments will be handled at $2.50 per ton rather

than $1.50 per ton.

GOMEZ further denied any knowledge of any

connections of CAMERON with any individuals not directly

associated with the shipping business. He specifically

denied knowledge of any underworld or criminal element

with any interest in an assassination plot designed to

eliminate FIDEL CASTRO, RAUL CASTRO Or ERNESTO "CHE"

GUEVARA. He, too, noted that at any time Cuban exiles gather

to discuss the Cuban situation, and this admittedly is the

main topic of conversation among all Cuban exiles, there is

always someone who would remark that CASTRO should be

killed. GOMEZ stated that he actually feels that the

assassination of FIDEL CASTRO would accomplish nothing

towards actually ridding Cuba of a Communist regime. He

denied paying any sum of money, agreeing to pay any sum

of money, or being approached for the payment of any sum

of money for the assassination of Cuban Government leaders.

GOMEZ advised that he, BABUN, and FERNANDEZ were

friends of JOSE "PEPIN" BOSCH and have

talked with him on

several occasions and at such time a discussion of the

general Cuban situation was part of the conversation.

GOMEZ specifically denied being present when any sum of

money was asked of BOSCH of at any time when BOSCH agreed

to pay any money for any plan having to do with the

assassination of Cuban Government leaders.

GOMEZ stated that although he has heard of

JULIO LOBO, a wealthy former Cuban businessman with

Interests in the sugar industry, he does not know LOBO

personally and has not been in contact with him.

the assassination of any Cuban Government officials. He

denied knowledge of any plot to effect such assassination

and denied approaching any person for the purpose of

soliciting any funds for the formulation or carrying out

of any such plan. He also indicated that in his opinion,

while the assassination of FIDEL CASTRO might bring personal

joy to many Cuban exiles whose immediate relatives may have

been tortured or killed by CASTRO and his regime, it would

actually accomplish nothing towards the overthrow of the

Communist regime of FIDEL CASTRO in Cuba. He admitted knowing

no, de baring.

BYRON CAMERON and the warehouse relationship with him. He

denied knowing anything concerning the personal background

of CAMERON, did not know his place of origin or birth, and
