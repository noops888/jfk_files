by SONNY CIANCUITTI of New Kensington, Pa., in connection with

$18,000 which TOPSI owes the New Kensington group. According

to informant TOPSI lost about $3,000 shooting dice at the

Bachelor's Club a few days before the 20th of February and

this fact was brought to the attention of the New Kensington

group and CIANCUITTI came to Squirrel Hill and had a talk with

TOPSI.

After the talk several people saw CIANCUITII confiscate

TOPSI's Cadillac automobile and parked it a few blocks away

from the Beacon Club. Informant said the grapevine reports

that TOPSI had another set of keys for the Cadillac and he

reclaimed the Cadillac and CIANCUITTI and his associate, not

known to the informant, went looking for TOPSI, found him, beat

him up and took over the Cadillac again.

Informant stated

insofar as he knows this is about where

the situation stands
