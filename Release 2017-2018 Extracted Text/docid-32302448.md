FOREIGN ECONOMIC MATTERS - CUBA

The following information was furnished by

Investigator

This source has furnished reliable information in the past:

The majority of this report deals with the

scarcity and manner of distribution of foodstuffs, as

well as other articles of prime necessity in Cuba. For

convenience it is subdivided under the headings of the

principal-food items.

COOKING OILS AND GREASE

The items which comprise the principal ones.

on the

Cuban dally diet are scarce and rationed. Part

of the difficulty in securing proper food in Cuba is due

not only to the scarcity,

in its

& distribution. The distribution system breaks

down,

and

the articles do not arrive in the hands of the

consumers with any consistent regularity.

A rationing system has been established for

all cooking oils and grease:

Rattoning cards are issued

to the people through the Comites de Defensa de la

Revolucion.
