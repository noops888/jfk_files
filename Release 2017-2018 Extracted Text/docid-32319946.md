If the policy of not acknowledging our FCI

targets is changed for any country's establishment or

officials, all coverages on the establishment or

officials, as well as cases opened on persons who

contacted

the establishment or officials will also be

declassified for foreign relations reasons. How

DOJ/DRC will handle these matters under Executive Order

12958 is uncertain since no case history has been

established yet.

It appears, at present, that the DRC

will protect the technical coverages, lookouts and mail

covers by allowing classification under the "method"

exemption.

The DRC has classified several

investigations using the foreign relations and method

exemptions. To date, no foreign relations exemption

has been declassified, but two on the former Soviet

Union are being referred to USDS.

If the investigation

is declassified, any telephone calls received at the

establishment or by the officials would be

declassified; however, much of the information would

still be protected under FOIA guidelines.

That would

not protect the fact of the technical coverage nor the

target. (70(u)

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, to postpone public

Nonetheless, when vital national interests would be

the Board to postpone disclosure.

Unfortunately, in this

instance the Board has refused to accede to our request. (U)

Disclosure of four of the documents in question would

reveal investigative or surveillance techniques used to gather

important information from a foreign country. Disclosure of this

material would compromise those techniques and impair foreign

are widely known. That we implement wiretaps to gather

Portions of documents 10402, 10133, 10170, and 10336

Long standing FBI and State

Department policy has been never to officially acknowledge that

the FBI investigates foreign officials or establishments not

involved in espionage or other criminal activity. This policy

has evolved for a number of reasons, at least two of which

warrant discussion here. (#(U

First, if we officially confirm what the public may

logically suspect in this regard, the country in question would

be all but compelled to diplomatically respond. We may presume

that most nations will tolerate in diplomatic stoicism the

clandestine intelligence activities of their peers so long as

such activities remain officially covert but no country can be

expected to countenance the publicly avowed targeting and

investigation of their diplomatic inviolate establishments and

The inevitable ramifications of such

official acknowledgements would complicate and impair the

relations of even long-standing allies, much less those of former

enemies or neutrals.

affect evolving relationships in others. When the relationships

in question are in a

example, we declassity our targeting of soviet orricials in thie

instance, then all other surveillance of the same officials in

other situations could no longer be classified on the ground that

disclosure would compromise foreign relations. Put differently,

once we discard the policy against officially acknowledging our

investigation of foreign establishments and agents, we can no

longer use it to justify withholding sensitive information. Just

as importantly, once the policy is breached, we may not be able

to use it to shield our investigation of other countries which we

target for surveillance. The same issue, for example, can be

expected to arise with regard to our investigation of other

members of the former soviet block, cuba, France

Venezuela, (S

Israel, and a large number of other nations. (s

We are not alone in maintaining this posture.

To our

knowledge, no other country acknowledges targeting, monitoring,

or investigating the establishments or officials of foreign

countries within their territory or elsewhere.

For these

reasons, then, the State Department seeks to maintain our

traditional policy of not officially acknowledging our

investigation of Soviet establishments and officials by

protecting the information in question. We have agreed to

advance this position on their behalf.

Conclusion

In the collective view of the FBI and the State

Department, the threat to United States intelligence operations

and foreign relations posed by the public disclosure of the

information at issue is of such gravity that it outweighs the

public interest in disclosure. Disclosure would reveal currently
