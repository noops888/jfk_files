A subsoquently schoduled weeting between PERRY and

ship in Champaign, Illinols, over the past weekend.

Chicago mintains a closed 157 file on PERRY,

reflecting him to be an old Vicelord fron the early form-

t1ve days of this gang, but as of as far back as 1966, no

longer active in or Influantial with the Vicelords because

of his advanced age (32) and obesity. PERRY has been to the

Chicago Offies of the FBI (1966) where he was interviewed by

the sac, and several sas involved in racial utters, regarding

his knowledge of vest side racial and gang problems.

been an employee of the old YICA Detached Street workers

ProgIaN, and In general it night be considered that he has

assumed an elder statesman type role lately ganguise. It

appears vary doubtlul that PERRY, Etreet-wise as he may be,

represents any signifieant segment of the vicelords.

Whether or not this 1s so, it appears that an

effort to further raise an eleuent of doubt regarding PERRY

is in order, noting his previous contrets with authority.

The following letter is therefore proposed for mailing to

the local BPP offlee, addressed to RUSH, stating as follows:

"Dear Black Brother:

I just heard son street talk about Pepilo trying

to get up tight with the fanthers.

He my say he's a lord

but some brothers that knos pop think he's one of Buckney's

sples and has been for years. I'n & lord, and I'll stay a

Lord, but watch that nother.

Hls akin is the only black

thing about hin. Ask his 11 he rorks for the pigs, and watch

him squirm. Is don't talk for many Lords elther.

Keep up the struggle, brother."

The above my possibly couprouise PERRY in tha

eyes of the BPP, eVell 1i only a suspicion of his intentions

aro raised.

As Will have boen robod, the above source in offcot

inftlated a rather surcessial counterintelligence nove nore of

less on the spot,

as a result of careful indoctrination and

instructions from the contacting si.

In this regard, the

source also embled Chicago to further harass the local BPP

when he proviced interation, the afternoon of January 24,

1969, reflecting that FRED LINTON was to appoar that eroning

This chapter appears completoly loyal to the

appaar at present to offer any spocific local avenue

of exploitation.

Any lOCRl BPP namber who expressed criticism

of the above leadership would in all probability be summarily

dealt with.

Chicago is not recomanding any anonyhous

with no results evident.

This technique has appeared

ineflective to this point, and Chicago feels should not

As the BureAU 1s amaro from referenced Chicago lotter

Consoquently, Chicago requests Bureau authority to

explore this mtter with CG 8896-R, the source referred to

previously, and thereafter take the appropriate steps to attempt

to effect the publication os the enclosed in the nol paper.

The Bureau 1a also roquestod to advise Chicago of

any sinilar outlet for the enclosed, olther at the Bureau or

another flold offico, which may not be of knonlodge to Chicago,

and which may offer nore potential for widespread dissenination.

As the BUTARU is ANBre, In the early morning hours

This 1s, of courso, not a counterintelligence action

further

indication of Chicago's contention that ubere an

It might be noted at this point that Chicago

continues to regard the local B'P as the focal point lor

counterin elligence in this field.

The letter of June 17,

1969, requests Burcau authority to attempt to publicize

cartoon depictions of the BPP in a subservient position

Mithin recent reos a relatively small, but highly

group of young Puerto Ricans has energed in the

Spanish speaking community, utilizing the name Young Lords.

Essentially a youth or street gang in nature, it has adopted

the pose of a political organization, and an

afilliation

with the BPP has arison. It apponre

that the real nature

of this group, and those associated with it, are not generally

rocognized by

the responsible elements in the community,

and the ille di this group, and of those persons in and

associated with it, are being revievod with the ond of

developing a suitable counterintelligence progran. A

reca-mondation will be prodided the Bureau in the event an

effective action can be tormulated.

2. & 3. Cperations being Effocted and Tangible Rosults

Cocained

Chicago at present has in elfect the program

authorized by the Bureau May 21, 1969, to inatzuct selected

BPP informants for use in creating a rift between the

BPP and SDS. It is ao get to early to detormine what, if

any, eirect will be forthconing.

This program additionally

has become somewhat complicated by the disruption which has

been created in the BPP locally by the June 4, 1969, raid of

the Chiago Office on the BPP houdquarters, and subsequent

Chicago Police Department arrests of some sixteen BPP moubers,

on a variety of local charges.

This program is being pursued very carefully,

in light of the Bureau's obaervations in letter or hay 21,

1969.

Tangible results subsequently obtained will be provided

the Bureau.

mont of crininas statutos violated by them on a local

The cartoons enclosed with relet are of excellent

In your discussions with

In the informant's mind that the use

Idea and not the contacting Agents.

Once you accompTish"

this, you can advise him that arrangements will be made

in this endeavor if this can be accomplished.

If the cartoons are published in "Muhammad Speaks,"

Chicago should consider obtaining Bureau permission to

Article appearing in

the 6/15/69 issue of

"Black Panthers Serving Youngsters a Diet

of Food and Politics."

6)

One copy of the "Black Panther Coloring Book."

The above enclosures are being furnished recipient

offices in view of the fact that these offices have had

Black Panther Party (BPP) breakfasts for children at least

on one occasion.

In some offices the "Breakfast for Children"

program is continuing even though school is out for the sumner.

It is

reasonable to expect that this program will be continued

by the BPP in the fall.

It has given the BPP a new impetus.

They have obtained excellent press coverage which has most

probably recruited or lined up persons for recruitment as a

result of this progran.

The reasons behind this program are obvious.

The

BPP needs a cornection with "the people,". They are able to

poison the minds of snall children who take this hate into

their homes.

The food used is usually obtained as a result

of semi-extortion and veiled threats. The Party uses mive

thinking clergynen in their breakfast program.

As a result,

churches are usually locations of the breakfasts.

Effective counterintelligence can successfully

disrupt the lack Panther Party in its vicious attempts to

poison the minds of children through its "Breakfast for

Children" program. The enclosures being furnished each office

have been reproduced on unwatermarked paper aud contain no

identifying information.

They should be reviewed for

counterintelligence merit. Specific proposals will bc enter-

tained at the Bureau concerning anonymous mailings of this

material and other pertinent material to persons

and places

involved in this program.

These mailings should be considered

for such people

as clergymen, lay leaders of the churches

involved, political leaders,

and

other pertinent persons.

Take no specific action without prior Bureau authority.

There are only two or three individuals within

there have been several indications that the relatlonhip

between the SPP and HOI has softened somewhat, in that

there have been contacts betreen the tho groups on a .

further that he desired cooperation betreen the tro

Also set larth therein was

Intornation that the national APP lesdership in Berkeley,

Calstorals, had been in contact with the Nol to attempt

to Bet KIVAN HUZANHAD to attend the July 18-21, 1969,

BPP conterences in California.)

Source considered it unlikely that at this

jancture, therefore, ELIJAN HUllAilAD sould antagonize

the BiP, since it appeals to his vanity to have aisy

group of organization solielt his support or appear to

come to his for assistance of any kind.

In the general conversation therefore, directed

at the NOI-BPP relationship, as 1t might be relevent to the

BPR-SIS altuation, the source was of the opinion that suHAMMAD

would not at present be receptive to auy material of this

type, and that the possibillty of engincering 1ts publication

Chicago definitely icels that this source, who

occuples a very delleate and sensitive position with the

IlI, should not in any way be piessured or persuaded to

tate or initiate any retion which in any way would compronise

him, or place him in a position where he is savoieths action

which appears counter to the desires of current policy o1

ELIJAH MUHAMID.

It 1s felt certain that the latterg

complote and dictatorial control of the Nol, and its pub-

Lication, and his denonstrated Willingness to rid himse 11

of anyone who lispleases his, precludes the use of this

source further

In Chicago's letter of Juse 17, 1969, which

initlated this avenue of counter-intelligence activity,

Chiengo noted that the use of the regular, daily white

preas, did not appear an appropriate nedius for the use

of such cartoons.

Prinarily this nas based on the feeling

that at that time the filetion between the SDS factions and

Bit was not of widespread enough public knowledge as

to render full mignificance of the cartoons to this medius.

In the Intervening period, the sna kational Convention

has been bold in Chicago,

with the full exploitation 1n

the dally press, on a very uldespread batis, of all the faction-

811an within the SDS, und the different approaches to and

relationships of these factions with the BPP.

In Chicago lettox of June 17, 1969, Chicago

requested to be advised of any suitable outlet for the

cartoons enclosed with that letter, of knowledge to the

Bureau, either at the Buread, or another field office.

Chiengo relterates this request at this time.

If no sinilar or anitable outlet is avallable,

Chicago then requests Bureau authority to anonynously mail

II. and III. Operations Being Effected and

Tangible Results Obtained

Reference has previously been made to the

specific counterintelligence actions initiated by

Chicago. No information has been received reflecting

tangible results of these actions.

Chicago has also continued to advise local

authorities of instances where Bpp members

appeal'

vulnerable to arrest on local charges.

In this regard,

Chicago letter to the Bureau dated November 21, 1969,

captionid "Black l'auther Party (BPP), RM" is concerred

with the location in Chicago of weapous reportedly

purchased legally by local BPP nenbers.

This infor-

mation has been furnished to local lav enforcement

officials. Officials of the Chicago Police Department

have advised that the department is wrently planning

a posit ve course a action relative to this

information.

Information has regularly been disseminated

by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local dissemination

in instances where Chicago BPP have travelled elsewhere.

LoCal BPP members have made a number of trips to

Illinois State University at Normal, Illinois.

Prior

knowledge of the presence of these subjects, their

identities and purpose of trip has been of value in

alertine local authorities to the potential for

violence represented.

IV. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

Illinois Bre and BOBBY LEE RUSH, Deputy Minister

of

A counterintelligence recommendation was

submitted by letter dated November 25, 1969, relative

it is proposed that the following letter be prepared

by this o'1ica for mailing to the "Letters to the Editor" column

In tha la:al neuspapers and to the student publications at

local col eges.

'Dear Editor:

'I racently read an old copy of the Black Panther

Party rewepaper dated February 27, where the writer for this

papor stated that it was a surpriße to then that their leader,

HUBY NANTON, only paid $650 per sonth rent for his apartuent.

The neuspaper wilters felt that sinco all the "pigs" like

President NIXON, live extravagantly off the fat of the land,

so should the suprese Commander of the Black Panther Party.

"I noted that the writers first labeled the charge that

NEATON lIved In a luxurious apartment as a "gross distortion".

"First, the Black Panther paper states that the

establishnent news media ls attempting to brutalize the Black

Panthers althout reason then they claln that HUEY should really

be living iu even more luxurious style than he

already 18.

According to the paper, HUEY and his "generals" should bave the

best, because of the strain of their efforts to plan party

stategy.

"It appears that the Black Panthers feel that "luxury"

is essential for their leader HUEY NEtToN to enable bin to dovote

his talents to the problems of the people.

The poor black

people in the ghetto must really approciate this."

As the bureau is aware, Chicago initinted the

two others from employment in the north

Subsequent to this period, havever,

that is early 1955,

there has been no indication of any kAM activity or organization

Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC)

Chicago is very cognizni of the Bureau's interest

in counterintelligence directed at SCLC, headed until nis

recent death by MARTIN LUTHER KING. The SCLC operation

locally has been very minimal, subsequent to the

early fall

of 1966, when the SCLC led a continuing series of large

scale open housing denonstrations here. Until the inauguration

of the Poor People Campaign (PPC), in

the winter of 1967-68,

the SCLC's program

here had for all practical purposes fallen

The only eifective part of the program was its Operation

Breadbasket, the only aspect of its operation whichreceived

any public attention, or publicity. In fact, after the

so-called accommoration between KING and city authorities,

in August, 1966, KING and the SCLC lost considerable face andno

longer were an effective or respected force.

most recently, the the here was achieving only

marginal support and success.

A Chicago source on the SCLC

payroll here, involved in organizing for the PPC, was in fact

responsible for developing the degree of promised participation

which is in evidence.

Due to the death of KING, the circumstances

surrounding same, and the resuiting re-organization aud

uncertainty concerning its leadership and future direction,

it rould appear any counterintelligence approach at present

might better be held in abeyance until such time as the future

program and leadership of SCIC are resolved. Consequentiy,

Chicago is

not at present suomitzing any specific counter-

intelligence suggestions.

The

Bureau is assured, however,

that the situation will be contimally reappraised from

the

standpoint of whether a productive and

effective program

is

advisable, and if so an appropriato specific suggestion will

be furnished the Bureau for

its approval.

The Chicago SNCC operation might be accurately

described

as a one man uperation, that is in the cerera of

counterintelligence action direcied at SNCC most profitably

rimed at BROVN. He is a nineteen year old high

school graduate,

residing at present with his nother, and

other minor family members.

Chicago feels that the most effective short term

method of countering BROWN's effectiveness, and local SNCC

influence, is to remove him from the scene, through some form

of legal or police action.

In this connection ME, LEON WOLIN, President,

Wolin and Levin Real Estate Company, 6448 South Stony

Island,

has been contacted over a period of time regarding SNCC since

this realtor operated the space where SNCC mintained an

office,

306 East 43rd Street,

As the Bureau is aware, SNCC

and BROWN lost this space when WOLIN had SNCC evicted

because

of the $880 in back rent owed him.

WOLIN has since stated

his intention of instituting legal action aguinst BROWN and

SNCC, for this non-payment of reat:

Whether this will to in

extent inhibit or prove a hinderance to the organization or

BROWN remans to be

seen, but the situation will be folloved

closely.

It might be noted also that BROWN was schedded to

report for a United States Army pre-induction physical

examination 1/15/63 at Chicago. BROWN reported, however,

cad not submit to a complete physica

A possibility exists

that BROWN may have obligatca himself to immediate sched.irg

for inducation, however, this matter has not deos completely

resolved and Chicago is

attempting to ciariiy his stutus vit

appropriate military authorities.

BROWN has previousty stated on a

number of occasaus

that he would not serve in the United States Armed Forces, md

would in all probabilty not report for

any induction order

In the event BROWN has placed himsell in a vulnerable positin

with military authorities: Chicago contemplates cursuing this

matter vigorously, with the soicotive Service authorities did

the office of the United States Attorney.

It is recognizod that this is not counterintelligence

in the classic sense of the term, hovever, it is believed

that any arrest, and future incarceration, of BROwN may

well have a sobering and restraining intluence on him and

his associates.

Such action could hardly

have an adverse

effect, since

the animosity of DCMN

and his associates for

the government hardly could be intensified.

Chicago also

does not feel such arrest, if possible, would have the effect

of rallying support to BROWN,

other than on the level of his

already extremely militant followers and supporters.

The Bureau will be advised of developments in this

matter.

financial resources of snee locally, sts somewhat tim

its somewhat Limited

lollowing, and its disorganization generally, Chicago is not

submitting any additional specific recommendations of a

counterintelligence nature to be directed at the organization.

Chicago is remaining alert, however, to any additional

opportunity to employ countcrintelligence methods against

SNCC Locally which would appear to offer potential for

accomplishing any or a combination of the goals set forth

above.

ically.

Attempts to develop an effective

counterintelligence approsch iocally are consequently being

directed at these aroas of development.

The Chicago black nationalist scene generally

continues to be a fragmented one, characterized by a number

of small and relatively Ineffective groups and individuals,

none of whom have indicated a willingness or ability to

work together or to polarize these to some extent competitive •

groups into a united front-type organization or grouping. Chicago

feels that through an effective and well thought out counter

intelligence approach, it may be possible to develop prograus

which will in some neasure contribute to the

continuation of this situation and prevent the energenco

locally of a group or individual who may serve eg a unitying

force within the black nationailst crouping. Chiesto will

remain continually alert to explore aud exploit bvery avenue

for possible counterintelligence activittes directed at the

black nationalist field which apesis to hold potential for

accomplishing this end. Any such development or technique

will be immediately made available to the Bureau for its

consideration and approval prior to inception by chlosso.

SUBJECT:

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE (BLACK PANTHER PARTY)

(BUDED 12/2/68)

For the information of recipient offices a serious

struggle is taking place between the Black Panther Party (BPP)

and the US organization. The struggle has reached such proportions

that it is taking on the aura of gang warfare with attendant

threats of murder and reprisals.

In order to fully capitalize upon BPP and US

differences as well as to exploit all avenues of creating

further dissension in the ranks of the BPP, recipient offices

are instructed to submit imaginative and hard-hitting

counterintelligence measures ained at crippling the ePP.

Commencing December 2, 1968, and every two-week period

thereafter, each office is instructed

to subnit a letter under

this caption containing counterintelligence measures aimcd

against the BPP:

The bi-weekly letter should also contain

accomplishments obtained during the previous to-week period under

captioned program.

All counterintelligence actions must be approved

at the Bureau prior to taking steps to implement them.

Operations Under Consideration

On a contraving basis Chicago 15 in the procuas of

development of an etinctive counterinteiligence progrem.

At the present time emphasis te

This sacuation remains sorether fluto and as yet

no specific counterintelligence program has been doveloped

for this readon.

As an example, in the initial stagos here of the

establishment of the SPP group there was conflict betreen

Oakland, Callfornia, the other unsanctioned.

By letter November 2%;

provisions. It 1s anticipated thet such a review wiil be

completed shortly and where appropriate, communication will

be submitted to the Bureau with specific recommendations

It might also be noted in passing that Chicago continues to

of.

changing times and events to embrace the Black Nationalist

field generally. The contacts with PARSONS, Informal in nature,

are considered to have been directly responsible for recent

statements by him, widely reported in the Chicago press

nedia, critical of gang influences in the Ghetto as well as

Black Nationalist groups, the latter described by him as

"gl1b exploiters of disenfrauchised people."

It 19 felt PARSONS W111 certainly continue to speak

out in such fashion and the contact by Chicago productive

of such will continue.

In referenced Chicago letter reference was made to:

possible friction between ROSSRI BROWN, above, and ROBERT

LUCAS, the latter the Nattonal head of the newly formed Blaci

Liberation Allance (BLA).

Since referenced letter no significant

developments have taken place in this regard and no fuither

information has been developed reflocting any interest on the

part of

BROWN in this group.

The BLA holds regular meetings,

however, to date less than 10 individuals have actually Joined

the organization, its activities limited almost exclusively to

these meetings and to such activities as literature distribution.

At the present time BLA appears to be floundering and to have

no real or apparent support within the legro community or from

Black Nationalists in particular. It is felt a counterintelligence

interest at this time in the BLA is not warranted.

2)

Operations Being Effected

Reference has

previously been made to the puriodis

contact with Judge PARSONS to this end. It has also been

noted. that Chicago is azaiting Bureau authority to implement

& counterintelligence program againat JAMES HARVEY.

mendations repaiding RARVEY were aubaitted

Chicago also will continus to selectively advise

local authoritles of instances where focal Black Nationalists

appear vulnerable to arrest on loca!

charges, in instances

where such information is either not available or apparent

to them.

This is in reference to such instances as that set

forth previously involving JEFF FORT.

3) Tangible Results

• In this regard, the remarks of Judge PARSONS, alluded

to previously and the arrest of FORT both appear as tangible

results of Chicago counterintelligence activity.

4) Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

The principal development locally, subsequent to

referenced letter, would appear to be the omergence of the

BPP Chapter referred to previously under the leadership of

ROBERT BROWN and his asgociates.

The question of the ability

of this group to provide a unifying and polarizing intluence

within the local

Black Nationalist community remains

to be

seen.

Chicago will very closely follow the development and

activities of this group, through knowledgeable BPP sources,

and will submit counterintelligence suggestions in the vi-monthly

letter requested by the Bureau as instructed.

ReSFtel to Director 4/8/69 captioned "Black Panther

Party, Racial Matters."

Referenced teletype disclosed that about twenty

dissidents from the BPP led by Tommy Jones and Richard Anderson

held a press conference two doors away from BPP National Head-

quarters, Berkeley, California.

This press conference was in

response to one held by Bobby. Seale, BPP chairman, the day before

at which time Seale had denounced Jones as an FBI infornant and

agent provocateur. Seale stated that Jones had been expelled

from the BPP for armed robbery.

Jones in return accused

the

Panthers of assassination and denied being an informant.

Jones

stated that the dissidents were not going to take this kind of

treatment lying down. Another of the dissidents,.

Richard Anderson, charged that he was thrown out because he

wanted to follow the ten point program laid down by Huey Newton.

He charged that Panthers changed their beliefs every day,

sometimes following Stalin, Lenin or Marx and then switching

to MAO Ise-tung. Anderson estimated that more than 100 persons

had been expelled from the BPP in recent months. Unidentified

women said that they jeft the BPP in disgust when they learned

the Panthers did not respect Party doctrine concerning the

protection of black women.

The above situation presents a definite potential

for counterintelligence which could result in the disruption

of the BPP on both a national and local level. Each office

receiving copies of this communication should review this

material with the view in mind of disrupting its local

chapter and assisting San Francisco as office of origin in a

disruption of the group on a nacional level.

Each office should specifically comnent on this turn

of events as it relates to its chapter and how it could relate

nationally. These comments may be placed in the next biweekly

Information available this office indicates

the Illinois chapter of the BPy, Chicago, receives

approximately 13,000 1o 18

,000

of the BPP newspaper

FICELY.

The paper is distributed, in the main,

munity centers

set up by the Beg wien then utilizes

FOURS

black children to sall the paper on the stcets.

There

is strong evidence that nany of the papers aic

given

away and that money derived from the sale of these

papers is not all turned in, same being pocketed by the

selter. The BeP, of course, also puts the paper on

various neisstands throughout the city, same newsstands

aiso hawling other militant papers such us Ms.

The

BPP also sends the

papers to other cities

in Illinois

for possible sale.

in contrast;

the noi forces its membership

to purchase uS in quantity and

to pay for same before

peddling it on the street corners:

The NOl, therefore,

is absurd of income before the nagers are out up for

sale to

the public.

this is especially true

inocfar as

dedicated

members are concorned.

There has been no evidence thus far which

would indicate the BPP in Chicago is in competition

with the NOI as relates to the sale of nerspapers..

There is no information the Nol is in competition

nith the

BPp in this connection either.

By

this it is meant that

there have been no known confrontations between members

of the two groups insofar as

the sale of the respective

papers is concerned..

It is interesting to note that information

available

indicates. the BPP in Chicago always calls the

offices of the NOI nouspaper and asks that

its reporters

cover proposed Bpp pross conferences.

NOT

responses to

such calls have been linited.

ILLiNOIS, HOVENIER 13: 1969

The police report on the incident reilects that

the incident was apparently the result of

a previous per

sonal altercation between

Bell and one James

Caldwell,

male Negro, 5801 South Calumet, who is a guard at the

Cook County Jail, Chicago.

As a result of this altercation, Bell, Winters,

and possibly others vent to Caldwell's

home looking for

nin.

He

was not at home, and Caldwell's wife then called

the

CPD: It was this call that the officers were responding

to.

The area outside the scene of the shooting remained

cain and no large crowds gathered.

A spokeswan

fui the Deputy Superintendent's Office,

CED: advisod that

the CPD is in the procoos ss aticopting

to determine how many

people actually

took part in the shooting

and is looking for at least one and possibly ino male Negroes,

detsils unknown, whom they believe took part in this shooting.

On November I3, 1969, a source, who has furnished

reliable information in

the past, advised that Bell, although

carried as a member of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther

Party (BPP),

is not a trusted member of that Party inasmuch

as he is and was suspected of being

P Stone Rangers,. a local Negro youth gang, Bell has been in

active for several months, almost since joining the Party, due

This source advised that Winters, also known as

Jake Winters, was a close assoclate of the BPP but was not &

member.

He was very knowledgeable in weaponry and is sus-

pected or

Source advised, however, that the BPP is now claiming

that both Bell and Winters were upstanding BPP members and are

attempting to obtain their photographs and will publish the

story concering captioned incident in the BPP newspaper in the

near future.

COUNTORINIELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALISI - HATE GROUPS

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

(BLACK PANTHEP PARTY) (BPP)

= DATE:

-1/13/69

In the Chicago letter of December 16, 1968, a

suggestion was made that an anonymous miling be sent JEFF

FORT, leader of the Blackstone Rangers; advising of BPP eiforts

to discredit him, and in effect to "take over" the Rangers.

As

events have subsequently developed, as set-forth inreferoreso

Clicago airiel and Lul,

the Rangers and be BPP have not only

not been able to forn any alliarce, but enmity and distrust have

arisen, to the point where each have been ordered to stay out ot

the others territory. The BPP. has since decided to conduct no

activity or attempt to do any recruiting in Ranger territory.

It appears therefore that the letter as originaily

intended at this point would serve no useful purpose.

The end

In view appears to have been very quickly arrived at,

in great

measure by virtue of the inherent inability of two such voltile

and power conscious groups to derogate any of their status oi

assumed authority to the othei.

From information recently received, it appears, however.

that the Bep has not entirely abandoned ali hope or utilicing

the Rangers for their oun purposes.

some feeling has been evident

that FORT may not continue indefinitely in his position of lender

shin with the Rangers, nost probably a reierence

to various

criminal charges facing him.

It is clear, horever, that so

long as he is in this position, any working arrangerent beticen

the

two groups vill be on Raiger terms.

Consequently, Chicago now reconmends the following

letter be sent FORt, handwritten, ou plain payer:

"Brother Jeff:

"I've spent some time with

some Panther friends on

the west side lately and I know what's been going on. The

brothers that run the panthers blame you for blocking their

thing and there's supposed to be a hit out for you. I'm not

& Panther, or & Ranger, just black. From what I see these

I think.

was you, You might hear from me agair."

"A black brother you don't know"

The above would be sent to FORT in care of the First

Presbyterian Church, 6401 South Kimbark, the widely publicized

headquarters of the

• Rangers.

It is believed the above may intensify the degree of

animosity between the two groups and occasion FORT to take

retaliatory action which could disrupt the BPP or lead to

reprisals against its leadership.

Consideration has been given to a similar letter

to the BPP, alleging & Ranger plot against the BPP leadership,

however, it is not felt this would be productive, principally

since the BPP at present is not believed as violence-prone as

the Rangers, to whom violent type activity, shooting, and the

like, are second nature.

There is also the possibility that

future contact between the two vere to take place, and it

became apparent that both had received such communications,

then an outside interest would be somewhat obvious.

Chicago will take no action regarding the above,

pending Bureau authorization.

A subsequently scheduled meting between PERRY and

not take place on February 8,

ship In Champaign, Illinois, over the past weekend.

Chicago mintains & closed

file on PERRY,

reflesting him to be an old Vicelord fros the early forma-

Elvo days of this gang,

but as of se far back as 1966, no

lonzor extive in or influential with the Vicelords because

of h1s advanced age (32) and obesity. PERRY has been to the

Chicago Olfice of the FBI (1966) where he was interviewed by

the SAL, and several SAs involved in racial vatters, regarding

his knowledge of west side racial and gang problens.

He has

boen an employee of the old XIA Detached Street Workers

Progran, and in general it night be considered that he has

assumed

an elder statesman type role lately gaugwise. It

appears very doubtful that PERRY, street-wise as be my be,

represents any significant seguent of the Vicelords.

Whether of not this is so, it appears that an

effort to further raise an elesent of doubt regarding PERRY

Is in order, noting his previous contacts with authority.

The following letter is therefore proposed for mailing to

the local BPP office, addressed to RUSH, stating as follows:

"Dear Black Brother:

I just heard some street talk about Pepilo trying

lord, but watch that mother.

Als skin is

the only black

thing about him. Ask him if he works for the pigs, and watch

him squirm. He don't talk for many lords either.

Keep up the struggle, brotber."

The above may possibly compromise PERRY in the

eyes af the BPP, even if only a suspicion of his intentions

at i local television studio for a videotaped interview with

local television personality HOHARD MILLER. The tape was to be

alred the following day.

Chicago was aware a warrant for nob action was out

standing for HAMPTON in his home town, Mayrood, Illinois, and

the above information regarding his whereabouts thet evening

was provided the haywood folice vepartment, with a suggestion

that they roquest the Chicago Police Departnent to serve thie

artost warrant. This was subsequently done, with HAMPTON arrested

at the television studio, in the presence of 25 BPP members and

studio personnel. This caused considerable embarrassnent to the

local BPP and disrupted the plans for HAMPTON's television appea-

rance.

The sailing of the above letter will await Bureau

authority. Chicago, however, will continue to capitalize on

opportunitles as they appear to inhibit local BPP activities,

in such instances as referred to regarding HAMPTON.

It wight be noted at this point that Chicago

6) One copy of the "Black Panther Coloring Book."

The above enclosures are being furnished recipient

offices

in view of the fact that these offices have had

Black Panther Party (BPP) breakfasts for children at least

on one occasion.

In some offices the "Breakfast for Children"

program is continuing even though school is out for the summer. .

It is reasonable to expect that this program will be continued

by the. BPP in the fall. It has given the BPP a new impetus.

They have obtained excellent press coverage which has most

probably recruited or lined up persons for recruitment as a

result of this prograil.

The reasons behind

this program are obvious.

The

BPP needs a connection with "the people." They are able to

poison the minds of small children who take this hate into

their hones.

The food used is usually obtained as a result

of semi-extortion and veiled threats.

The Party uses naive

thinking clergymen in their breakfast program.

As a result,

churches

are usually locations of the breakfasts.

Effective counterintelligence can successfully

disrupt the Black Panther Party in its vicious attempts to

•poison the minds of children through its "Breakfast for

Children" program.

The enclosures being furnished each office

have been reproduced on unwatermarked paper and contain no

identitying Intormation.

They should be reviewed for

counterintelligence merit. Specific proposals will be enter

tained at the Bureau concerning anonymous mailings of this

material and other pertinent material to persons and places

These mailings should be considered

for such people as clergymen, lay leadars of the churches

involved, political leaders, and other pertinent persons.

Take no specific action without prior Bureau authority.

In recent weeks a highly vocal group of young

Puerto Ricans calling themselves the Young Lords have

undertaken action in the north side Puerto Rican neighborhood.

This group is basically a youth gang, however, they have become

active in neighborhood matters particularly urban renewal

problems for the area. Information avallable concerning the

Young lords and its leaders is being reviened with the end

in nind of the possiblilty of developing a suitable counter-

intelligence program concerning this group. When and 1f a

suitable recommendation 18 developed, such will be provided

to the Bureau in the event an effective action can be

formulated.

OPRATIONS BEING EFFECTED AND TANGIBLE

RESULTS OBTAYNED

Chicago at present has in effect the program

authorized by the Bureau July 31, 1969, to mail copies

of cartoons prepared to further efforts to create a rift

botween the BPP and Students for a Denocratic Soclety (SDS).

It 18, as yet, too early to determine what, 11 any, effoct

w111 be forthcoming.

This program 1s being pursued very carefully, in

light of the Bureau's observations in letter of July 31, 1969.

Any tangible results subsequently obtained "ill be provided

the Bureau.

4. DEVELOPKENTS OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE LATEREST

The recent statement of DAVID HILLIARD, BPP, Chlof

of staff, that the BPP w1ll take action against SDS If they

make "one more counter-revolutionary statement" would appear

to indieate a widening of & rift between the "BPp and SDS.

This situation will be followed closely and where a

counterintelligence effort. would appear to have ressonably

tangible potential, a suitable recommendation will be

subnitted.

No counterintelligence action will be taken by

Chicago w1thout Bureau approval.

BLACK PANTHER FARTY (BPP)

On November 22, 1969, FRED HAMPTON, Deputy

ChaIrIan, IllinOis BPP and BOBBY LFF RUSH,

Deputy

BPP, telling everyone that if they were

When everyone arrived the meeting began with an announcement

by HAMPTON that everyone but hiaself and RUSH were hereby

They would all be known as "Friends

Operations Being Effected and

Tangible Results Obtained

Reference has previously been made to the

specific counterintelligence actions initiated by

Chicago. No Information has been received reflecting

tangible results of these actions.

Chicago has also continued to advise local

authorities of instances where BPP members appear

vulnerable to arrest ou local charges.

In this regard,

Chicago letter to the Bureau dated November 21, 1969,

captioned "Black Panther Party (BRP), RM"

is concerned

with the location in Chicago of weapous reportedly

purchased legally by local BPP members. This infor

mation has been furnished to local lay enforcement

oificials.

Officials of the Chicago Police Department

have advised that the department is currently planning

a positive coursed action relative to this information.

Information has regularly been disseminated

by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local dissemination

in instances where Chicago SPP have travelled elsewhere.

Local BPP members have made a number of trips to

Illinois State University at Normal, Illinois. Prior

knowledge of the presence

of these subjects,

their

identities and purpose of trip has been of value in

alerting local authorities to the potential for

violence represented.

IV. Developments of Counter intelligence Interest

Recently FRED HAMPTON, Deputy Chairman,

Illinois BPP and BOBBY LEE RUSH, Deputy Minister of

Detense, called a general meeting of the Chicago Branch

of the BPY at which time HAMPTON announced that

everyone, but himself and RUSH, were purged from the BPP.'

A counterintelligence recommendation was

submitted by letter dated November 25, 1969, relative

to this action.

This situation is being followed closely and

where any further counterintelligence avenue appears

likely a suitable recommendation will be made.

No counterintelligence action will be taken

by Chicago without Bureau approval.

Regarding the remainder of local Black

Chicago continues to follow

counterintelligence effort

would appear to have reasonable potential.

case. These four pigs were killed by

men trying to escape capure for

another crime they had supposedly al-

ready committed; their reasoning was

not to deal with the oppressor or the

symbols of his 'presence' - it was

a matter of

survival. When

I say

survival, I'm not relating to the sur-

vival of a race or group of people as

is the concern of revolutionaries, but

I am refecring in this case to indivi-

dual survival.

What then is the reason for even

dealing with the deaths of these four

pigs since it cannot be labeled "rev-

olutionary' or as having been done in

the 'service of the people'... the rea-

son is simple enough. The deaths of

these four pigs and especially their

dying in this manner should point out

the fallacy of

'superman' image

of the pigs and the plausibility of deal-

ing with them in such a manner in

the interest of the masses and the

liberation of the oppressed people of

Babylon.

The pigs have always tried to main-

tain an image of being 'indestructable,"

In the past whenever there were shoot-

outs or confrontations

between the

pigs and the people, there was never

any pig killed, one never died even in

There are brothers and sisters who

have been involved in these so-called

"disturbances", and they can testify

that in many cases it would have been

impossible for the pigs to have come

out with so few casualities and/or

deaths. This whole myth of indestruc-

tibility has been perpetuated to make

the pigslookunbeatable, to discourage

the people from righteously dealing

with these scurvy punks as the snakes

and cowards that they are. This super-

man image has been maintained at all

costs but the image is slipping; as

the people prepare to deal with their

enemies,

seem to be losing their ability to

soar through the air.

There are four dead pigs, killed by

two men with guns...the pigs can and

will die but not frum a wish and a

pray. Relate to pigs as men, leas

than men, rather as foul perverts, and

see that they can be dealt with. Pigs

are only flesh and bone, and they.

will bleed: they will die. When the hour

of reckoning comes, as you move into

the streets to fight for your survival,

It is felt that the publication of such a letter

would further serve to escourage disillusionment on the part

of the Black Panther Party supporters as to the competency of

HUEY NEWTON and those panthers responsible for the make up

of the Panther paper.

The receipt of such material by those engaged in

Fox the information of recipient offices a serious

struggle is taking place between the Black Panther Party (EPP)

and the US organization. The struggle has reached such proportions

that it is taking on the aura of gang warfare with attendant

threats of murder and reprisals:

In order to fully capitalize upon BPP and US

differences-as well as to exploit all avenues of creating

further dissension in the ranks of the BPP, recipient offices

are

instructed to submit imaginative and hard-hitting

counterintelligence measures aimed at crippling the BPP.

Commencing Decenber 2, 1968, and every two-week perioc

thereafter, each office is instructed to submit a letter under

this caption containing counterinceiligence measures aimed

against the BPP. The bi-weekly letter should also contain

accomplishments obtained during the previous two-week period under

captioned program.

All counterintelligence actions must be approved

at the Bureau prior to taking steps to implement them.

1) Operations Under Consideration

On a continuing basis Chicago is in the procees of

Black Nationalist situation fron the viorpoint of the

At the present time emphasis is being placed upon the develop

establishment of the BPP group there was conflict between.

4). Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

The principal development locally, subsequent to

referenced letter, would appear to be the emergence of the

BPP Chapter referred to previously under the leadership of

ROBERT BROWN and his associates.

The question of the ability

of this group to provide a unifying and polarizing intluence

within the local Black Nationalist community remains to be

seen.

Chicago will very closely follow the development and

activities of this group, through knowledgeable BPP sources,

and will submit counterintelligence suggestions in the bi-monthly

letter requested by the Bureau as instructed.

As noted, intoriation reflects that BPP overturos to

the BR were not velconed, particularly by PORT and otbors in

the BR lendership.

This eleuent obviously does not dosire

that the allegiance of these large numbers of legro youths

As a result of the lack of succoas on the

part of the BPP in this direction, BROWN and his 6h101 1104-

4. Operations Under Consideration

Since the above referenced letter, Chicego tas

continued to clusely follow local developments in the Bisc

Hationalist fleid, with the devolopmont of effective cousior-

Intelligance tochniques constantly In eind. Although all

facets of Black Nationalisi activittor and moups are so

Chicago reflecting tangible results of these actions.

Chicago has also continued to adviso 10091

authorities of instances where local Black Nationaliste,

particularly BPP members, appear vulnerable to arrest

on local charges. Along these lines Chicago lotter of

february 10, 1969, set forth spocific Mormation whereby

FRED HAMPTON, lOCAl BPP OffICeT, WAs arrested just prlOr

to a television appearance, through efforts of a Chicago

BPP source and Chicago Special Agents. The arrest was an

effective source of embarrassment to the ipP; however.

HAMPTON was subsequently found innocent, in jury trial,

of the nob action charges for which he had been arrested.

Additionally, information has regularly bees

disseminated by Chicago to other Bureau offices for locai

dissemination in instances where Chicago BPP subjocts have

travelled elsowhere.

Specifically local APP subjects have

on soveral occasions journeyed to the University of

IllInole,

Champaign, Illinois, and their activittes there

have resulted in numerous arrests. Prior Inowledgo of

the presence of these subjects, their purposes and

Identities, have been of great valuo in alertiar local

suthorities to the potential for violence represented.

One of those local BPP nonbers arrested in

Springfiold was determined to be on probation on local

Chicago charges. Inasmuch as the arrest represented s

violation of this probation, the information regarding

the arrest vas unde avallable to the appropriato Castago

Police authorities, and probation authoritien.

Unfortunately.

both oxpressed a lack of interest in taking any action

1n this matter.

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

As in the recent past, the nost significant

area of development continues to center around the

cilvitles of the local BPP.

It has suffered fron

organizational and factional problems, as well as

Iinancial difficulties, and has yet to prove its ablilty

to serve as a cohesive or unflying influence in the

Local Black Nationalist community.

Referenced teletype disclosed that about twenty

dissidents from the BPP led by Tonmy Jones and Richard Anderson

held a press conference two doors amay from BPP National Head-

quarters, Berkeley, California, This press conference was in

response to one held by Bobby Seale, BPP chairman, the day before

at which time Seale had denounced Jories as en FBI infornant end

agent provocateur.

Seale stated that Jones had been expelled

iron the BiP for armed robbery. Jones in return accused tha

Panthers of assassination and denied being an informant.

Jones

stated that the dissidents were not going to take this kind of

treatment lying down, Another of the dissidents!

Richard Anderson, charged that he was thrown out because he

wanted to follow the ten point program laid down by Huey Neiton.

He charged that. Panthers changed their beliefs every dây,...

sometimes following Stalin, Lenin or Marx and then switching

to MAO Ise-tung. Anderson estimated that more than 100 persons

had been expelled from the BP! in recent.months. Unidentified

women said that they left the BPP in disgust when they learned

the Panthers did not respect Party doctrine concerning the

protection of black women.

The above situation presents a definite potential

for counterintelligence which could result in the disruption

of the BPP on both a national and local level. Each office

receiving copies of this communication should review this

material with the view in mind of disrupting its local

chapter and assisting San Francisco as office of origin in a

disruption of the group on a national level.

Each office should specifically comment on this turn

of events as it relates to its chapter and how it could relate

nationally.

These comments may be placed in the next biweekly

letter. Specific proposals for counterintelligence on a local

level concerning this matter should be furnished the Bureau for

action and San Francisco for information.

This matter is being

followed closely at the Bureau.

It is believed that such action could cause

concern to the leadership in the illinois Chapter, BPP,

is to the reinensiblilty of the locl leadership ir

permitting the usurpation of the BPP name without prior

knowloge of local leaders.

This could create nistrust

among the leaders of the Illinois Chapter.

It is noted that the Illinois Chopter of the

BPP 13 closed to new membersuip, and has been for nore

than six months; through the use of above techniquu it

is possible for

us to attack this exclusive membership policy

of the BPI, possibly causing the UPP to accopt new momburg

thereby aftorcing now opportunities for intormant tutiltration.

No action will be taken by Chicago until Bureau

approval is received.

BLACK NATIONALIST-HATE GROUPS

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

(BLACK PANTHER PARTY)

DATE: 5-26-70

The Bureau has reviewed your proposal with interest

and appreciates the aggressive-type thinking in connection with

your counterintelligence program.

• It is believed the potential risk involved in

forcing the leaders of the Illinois Chapter to concentrate on

recruitment in East Chicago Heights might lead to the formation

of a National Committee to Combat Fascism in a Negro ghetto

which has had considerable racial unrest. In this connection,

it could be expected that the BPP leaders

would be unduly

aroused over the thought that another group (in this instant

a non-existent group) was attempting to unite the blacks in

opposition to the BPP.

Past experience has indicated that the BPP would

quickly send investigators into an area in order to discredit

any group and thereafter capitalize on resulting publicity for

their own recruiting. In regard to your proposal, the BPP

out "non-

existent" provocateurs and use the opportunity to organize a

new operation.

Thus, in essence, we would be responsible

fon' a new BPP operation in a highly volatile racial

community.

Also, 1t 1a a moot question whothor it in novantagooun

to our Investigation versus informant needs for the BPP 1n

Chicago to lift its recruiting restrictions on membership. This

is especially an acute problom with the advent of the hot summer

months ahead and the Chicago organization is already one of the

largest BPP chapters in the country.

In view of the above, your proposal is not approved.

Set torth herewith lo the periodic progiess

letter concerning captioned matter.

I. OPERATIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION

The Bureau has previously advised that it

would be sufficient to note dates on which letters have

been submitted in captionod matter, regarding counter-

intelligence proposals concorning

the Black ranthor Paty

(LPP) for the period covered by the

quarterly letter.

Since the date of referenced letter, these

lotters have been submitted as follows: 5/13/70, 5/28/70.

Chicago continues to analyze the available current

Information regarding local BPP activity in a continuing

effort to dotermine what, 11 any, such

information may be of

assistance in the development of

& counterintelligence effort.

The BPp continues to be considered the focal point for

counterintelligence.

II, and III, OPERATIONS REING EEMICTED AND

VANQUILD LELANDS MANNED

Reference has previougly been made to the

specitic counterintelltgence actions initinted by Chicago.

No information has been recelved reflecting tangible

results of there actions.

Chicago has also continued to advisa local

authorities of instances where Bly members appear

vulnerable to arrest on local charges.

Information has regularly been dissoninated

by Chicago to other Bureau offices for local dissemination

in instances where Chicago BPP members have travelei else-

where. Prior knowledge of the presence of BPP members in

their areas has been of value in alerting local authorities

to the potentil for violence that their

resence represents.

IV. DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTERINTFLLIGENCE INTEREST

There are no current developients concerning the

Illinois Chapter of the EPP which would appear to have

reasonable potential for counterintelligence activity.

Regarding the remainder of local Blse! Nationallat

groups and individuals, their activities are fragmented

and limited.

Chicago continues

to follow such activities

in the event information is developed which would indicate

a counterintelligence effort would appear to have reasonable

potential.

Information available this office indicates

approximately 13,000 to 18,000 of the BPP newspaper

wEEKly.

The paper is distributed, in the main,

to com-

munity centers set up by the BPP

which then utilizes

young black children to sell the paper on the streets.

There is strong evidence that many of the papers are

papers is not all turned in, same being pocketed by the

The BPP,

of course, also puts the paper on

various newsstands throughout the city, same newsstands

also handling other militant papers such as MS.

The

BPP also sends the papers to other cities in illinois

for possible sale.

In contrast, the NOI forces its membership

to purchase us in quantity and to pay for same before

peddling it on

the street corners: The NOl, therefore,

is assured of income before the papers are put up for

sale to the public.

This is especially true insofar as

dedicated members are concerned.

There has been no evidence thus far which

would indicate the BPP in Chicago is in competition

with the NOI as relates to the sale of newspapers..

There is no information the NOI is in competition

with

• the

BPP in this connection either. By this it is meant that

there have been no known confrontations between members

of the two groups insofar as the sale of the respective

papers is concerned.

It is interesting to note that information

available indicates the BPP in Chicago always calls the

offices of the NOI newspaper and asks that its reporters

cover proposed BPP press conferences. NOI responses to

such calls have been limited.

BPP and NOI sources report these organizations

I t

1s interesting to note:

that these sources report

the

reasois coalitions have not been formed

is because both

would want to control and direct the activities of any

group they became involved with and would also demand

the group follow their tenets totally and that ould

include all of the funds involved.

It is believed the above clearly shows the

seeds of open conflict between the NOl and the BPP are

present and could flare up at any time.

Chicago recommends the Bureau not involve it-

self in the matter at this time and let the two organi

zations develop their animosiiies

FRED LIVES

5 a.m., December 4, Nixon and Daley's avaricious pigs

utally slaughtered the Chairman of the Illinois Chayter

the Black Panther Party, and a member of the Peoria

anch.

The pigs, with their usual tactics, attached an

artment where 9 Panthers were siceping.

The result of

e raid: Fred Hampton and dark Clark dead, four others

itically wounded, and three others arrested and charged

Ill attempted murder for deferding themselves.

airman Fred was shot 7 times, Ronald "Doc" Sachel, Minister of Health and in charge of the

•ee Medical Clinic, is in critical condition, shot 5 times. Deborah Johnson, an 8 1/2-month

egnant sister, is in jail. The pigs won't let the lawyers see her or anj of the diher

›litical prisoners.

sis is the second attack on a Panther apartment in 3 days. On December 2, 80 pigs attacked

ad brutally beat 3 Panthers including another expectant mother, Lynn French. Tony Harris

ss beaten so badly that he was later unable to recognize his own wife. And just three weeks

no. Panther Jake Winters was gunned down defending the black community.

hese murders show cicarly the fascist tactics that the gestapo Daleys, rovisi Holfmans, nui-

ongering Nixons and money-hungry Rockefcitors use agairsi the biach Faninee Fariy, piduress-

dc people, and the poor, oppressed masses who are demanding their basic needs: land, bread.

susing, clothing, education, justice and peace.

he members of the Black Panther Party were right in defending themselves.

Jake Kinters' re-

olutionary actions were just and necessary.

Any people whose

constitutional rights are

rampled upon by the oinking pig power structure have a right to pick up the gun.

'e call upon all people to unite in stopping these monstrosities--the murders of Chairman

red, Mark Clark, Jake Winters, and all our Vietnamese brothers and sisters.
