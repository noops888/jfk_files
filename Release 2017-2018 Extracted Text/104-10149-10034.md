Veciana 31, paragraph 201, line 6. Insert "contribution" after "$500";

Delete "financier and industrialist,

Codename LSKEMER-1, with whom the CIA had a long-standing operational

relationship". Four lines later; beginning with "or the industrialist"

delete remainder of paragraph.

even though the Agency later used the Puerto Rican as a conduit for the

Puerto Rican from his personal

funds.
