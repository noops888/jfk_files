Re Bureau letter to NK dated 6/25/68, which set

posed member of this "Family"Â®

resided many years in Philadelphia, Pa., before moving t

Trenton,

His lather is a member of

the ANGELO BRUNO

ION "Family". NK 2207-C-TE has stated JOSEPH JOHN SABATO

has been involved in gambling in Trenton on behalf of

DE CAVALCANTE.

NK 2376-C-TE has identified a JOSEPH SABATO as a

member of the len; however, it is believed that this

JOSEPH SABATO is actually GIUSEPPE SABATO, aKa JOSEPH

SABATO, Peppi, who has been identified as

an ICN member

of the GENOVESE "Family."

It is noted that JOSEPH JOHN SABATO'S father is

also named GLUSEPPE SABATO.
