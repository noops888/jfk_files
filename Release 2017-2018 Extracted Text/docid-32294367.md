REGARDING JOE PAT DA MOUR

advised that according to the last contact

he had with JOE PAT DAMOUR he was residing at Apartment

1201, Peachtree Apartments, 2285 Peachtree Road, Atlánta,

Georgia, telephone 876-0701.

said he does not know

if this is the location that

law enforcement officers are

aware of but in the event they are not aware of this

Information, it should be used discreetly since DA MOUR

only gives his phone number and address to friends in

the burglary business that he feels he can trust.

advised that ISABELL (LNU), the ex-girl

friend of ROBERT

EMERSON WHITE is now living in the Atlanta

area and

frequently contacts JOHN/HENRY WILDER and JOE PAT

DA MOUR.

said it was the feeling of a lot of the

burglars that ISABELL was an informant for the FBI since

she had been contacted by FBI Agents in Georgia. He said

ISABELL claimed once in the latter part of 1967 that BILLY

TEAL and JOHN HENRY WILDER threatened to kill her in a motel

in Huntsville, Alabama, by giving her an overdose of drugs.

said at this time she allegedly ran out of the motel

in the nude looking for the police.

said that

there were "syndicate" contacts

of the bank burglars in Tampa,

Florida and Miami, Florida,

as well as in the Bahama Islands. He said in the past

several months DA MOUR had been contacted by a "syndicate!'

man in Tampa, Florida,, and he made his contact by calling

an attormy who represented BIlLy DELAnd WaldeN.

some bank in Florida they wanted hit and they were asking

for a

good safe man to be sent down to look things over.

said that A MOUR flew down to the Bahamas accompanied

by one

of the "syndiate" men from Tampa to lo0k the situation

over.

He said DA MOUR lived It up at the casino and ran up

a big bill on the "syndicate" nen and they sent him back to

Atlanta saying they could not use him

said that DA MOUR would do practically

anything illegal including strong armed robbery. He

said DA MOUR's m.O. 'is that of a robber rather

' then a

burglar. He said he specialized in strong armed jobs

where he goes into a home with one or more other individuals

usually wearing a mask and ties them up robbing the victims

of all their valuables.

He said he has heard rumors that DA MOUR is a

suspect of unknown armed robberies inthe Atlanta area

and DA MOUR has indicated he may possibly pull some bank

robberies particularly in the areas where he is not known.

He said that he knows DA MOUR has frequently flown to the

West Coast and it is possible that he may have been involved

in bank robberies in that area.

He said DA MOUR, also specialized in sticking

up crap games or gambing operations where there is a lot

of money involved and the probability is since the victims

were engaged in illegal actions themselves; they would

not report the robbery to the authorities.

He said

DA MOUR 1s also frequently involved

In bank burglares and since the falkner, Mississippi

Bank burglary, likes to hit banks that have safety deposit

boxes. He said DA MOUR is not a very good safe man and

usually uses

someone else

who is familiar with the oxygem

lance

and burning bar procedure to get into the safes..

He

said in the part he knows DA MOUR has worked

with GENE CLAUDE FASTERLING, BILLY DELANO WALDEN and

JIMMY KIMES.

described DA MOUR as a vicious

vindictive individual who would not hesitate to kill

anyone who he thought may have double crossed him, but

on the other hand DA MOUR himself frequently double

crosses the men he works with. He said It was DA MOUR's

favorite trick after rummaging through safety deposit

boxes, etc., In burglaries to say "all I got was a few

coins"

, when in fact it is obvious that he gets a lot of

loot which he conceals from his accomplices.

REGARDING BILLY DELANO WALDEN

advised as far as he knows BILLY WALDEN

operates

all over Augusta,

Georgia, but that he does

not know his present address.

He said WALDEN can always

be contacted by calling Mama Mia's Restaurant in Augusta,

Georgia, and leaving a name and number for him to call back.

He said it is WALDEN's normal procedure to check on the

individual

"Billy the Burner"

• He said that WALDEN, however, is not

really a good man with the burning bar or oxygen lance,

but that he is the supply source for this piece of equipment.

said that WALDEN is the contact man for

the fences in Youngstom and Chillicothe, Ohio. He said

that normally when burglars obtain savings bonds from bank

burglaries they contact WAlDEN and he puts them in touch

with the people to deal with concerning the stolen bonds.

before he entered the place he was approached by a man who had

been following him and said "You're Mi: HEAD aren't you",

and when he said he was, the man told him to come with

him and he took him to the man he gave the bonds to.

said he has been told that the "syndicate! men check

out

a man in this marner to make sure that he is not being

followed to their place by any law enforcement official.

said he will probably be able to talk with

WALDEN and determine the source where WALDEN obtains

the burning bars commercially, as well as determining

the name of the fences in Ohio.

He said that the burglars

were now using two types of burning bars one type being

burning bars that were home made and a larger type burning

bar which is obtained through BILLY WALDEN. He said

apparently WALDEN has a source where he can obtain these

without them ever being traced back to anyone.

said that WALDEN also allegedly has contact

with the

"syndicate" men in Florida and II they want sate

men they usually contact WALDEN's attorney who in turn

communicates with WALDEN and tells him who to contact in

Florida. He said he has heard that WALDEN and some of his

associates may have been involved in some strong armed

deals in the Miami area where they forced their way into

the house/and then the safe wen such as WALDEN would

open the safe and

obtain the contents.

was to have made contact with BILLY DELANO WALDEN and the

brother of the top "syndicate" man in the Tampa area. He

said the "syndicate" man or his brother is JOE (LNU), but

he said he has heard the last name but can not remember

the pronunciation of it as it is an Itallan name. He said

this man lives in a large white clapboard house in the

Tampa area and he believes it has a Spanish type roof.

said there might be some way of checking

out this

trip to the Bahamas because he had some difficulty

with custom authorities.

He said he traveled down to the

Bahamas under the name of DAVIS but on the return trip

used the name ANDERSON which apparently got him in some

kind of difficulty with custom authorities. He said the

"syndicate" man who apparently got in some kind of difficulty

with customs used the name of GOMEZ

said HEAD told him they went to Nassau and

Freeport in the Bahamas where HEAD checked into a hotel or

moted under the name of DAVIS. He said that WALDEN was to

have accompanied him on this trip but this occurred on the

same time that WALDEN's wife was committing suicide or

attempted suicide and he had to immediately return to

Augusta, Georgia.

He said that apparently the same "syndicate"

people that DA MOUR had contacted were the ones that HEAI

was put in contact with. He said one of the banks they

were interested in hitting in the Bahamas was fingered by

a contractor who built the bank vault. He said he belleves

Hersaid that apparently the "syndicate" checked

with

the Police Department and tound out that this vault

was "bugged"

but before they could relay this to everyone

involved, two of the lurglars that were to hit the bank allegedly

got arrested, one of them being a Negro man.

they cased in that area had what he believed to be some

kind of British type of alarm system and he mentioned the

name CHUB TAYLOR MOSLER and this was supposed to have been

In the Bahamas.

He said HEAD apparently returned to Mississippi

without completing any bank scores but that apparently

the so called "syndicate" men had several banks in the

Miami area as well as the Bahamas they were interested

in burglarizing.
