RE:

ITAR - GAMBLING

(DL 166-102)

Texts

PCI DOMINICK S. BUCCIERI, Fort Worth, Texas,

recently advised that he had been in the Surfside Six

Club, Fort Worth, and observed subject MATTHEWS, a Dallas

hoodlam, along with an ex-prize fighter from Dallas named

TONY GENERO, with a group of ther people he did not recognize.

PCI Stated during the evening he overheard MATTHEWS on

telephone stating to the operator that the dea code was 405

and when he got his party on the phone he heard MATTHEWS

tell this party that all was arranged and for the other

party to "not sweat it". PCI stated he did not know the

significance of this conversation but got the impression that

MATTHEWS had GENERO along with him as one of his employees.

DL 92-625-SUB

As Bureau has been advised MATTHEWS is under

prosecution by IRS having been arrested on 7/29/66, for

failure to obtain a Federal Wagering Stamp.

The area

code, 405, referred to by MATTHEWS is undoubtedly. MATTHEWS

¡contacts in Oklahoma City, since 405 covers Oklahoma City

and MATTHEWS is known to be in frequent contact with GEORGE

BARNES, gambler,

Wheatland, Oklahoma,

located just outside

Oklahoma City.

RE: JAMES EGREGG

HAR - GAMBLING

TeXAS

(DL 166-470)

GREGG vis contacted again this past week as indicated

in reairtel.. At that time he was sick and not able to be

interviewed,

but siad that he wanted to clarify the matter and

would be agreeable to interview as soon as he is well enough.

Previous efforts to identify a TONY GENARRO have been negative,

however, Bureau will note from information furnished by PCI

under MATTHEWS matter; this could well be same individual of

interest in the GREGG

matter.

Dallas will make further efforts

this date to identify GENERO or GENARRO.
