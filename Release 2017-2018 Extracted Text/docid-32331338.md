Enclosed is the original and five copies of IHM concern-

ing the subject. It does not appear that the CHARLES WHITE,

who holds US Passport Number 1000636, issued 7/8/68, is

identical to the subject. Furthermore, he does not have a

current of a former wife named DOROTHY. In addition, the

NYO does not know TOURINE to have visited Italy recently.

It is not necessary for Legat to maintain stop placed

with the Italian police on the subject at this time. In the

event any contemplated travel to Italy is learned on the part

of the subject, Legat will be immediately avised, and all

pertinent information will be forwarded.

Washington Field will check US Passport Number 1000636

issued 7/8/68, in the name of CHARLES WHITE, who was born

5/28/05. It is believed by the NYO that this CHARLES WHITE

is not identical to the subject. Furthermore, this CHARLES

WHITE and the subject have different dates of

birth, and
