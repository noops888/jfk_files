Summary of Victor Espinosa Deposition Taken June 7,

1978 in Washington, D. C.

I.

Background: Association with the Revolutionary.

Council of the University of Havana, 1954-1959.

Victor Dominador Espinosa Hernandez was born to a

wealthy, landholding family in Cuba. In 1954, he entered

the University of Havana, joining two of his childhood

friends Jose Antonio Echeverria and Rolando Cubela in the

student political movement. Cubela and Echeverria, some-

what older than Espinosa, were at the time already firmly

established as the leaders of the Revolutionary Council of

the University of Havana, primarily directing their efforts

against the Batista regime.

Numerous clashes with the

police and general inattentiveness to studies prompted

Espinosa's father to send Espinosa to Louisiana State

University in Baton Rouge in 1955. (pp. 3-6, 43-47)

When Espinosa became eighteen years of age in ap-

proximately 1956, he left L.S.U. and returned to Cuba to

manage the ranch-estate left to him by

the death of his

grandfather.

Upon

his return, his political fervor some-

what tempered, Espinosa was content to go about his business,

and spend long weekends in Havana once a month pursuing less

idealistic endeavors such as gambling and women.. (p. 47)

During one of these sojourns in Havana, Espinosa received

a

telephone call from Cubela advising him that Echeverria had

just returned from

a meeting in Mexico with Castro, and

wanted to assemble the "old" group, as Castro wanted them

to step up their activities against Batista.

As a result of the meeting, action groups were

formed under the direction of Cubela and Echeverria. Each

group consisting of approximately four men was given the

task of assassinating a designated high ranking official of

the Batista Government.

Among the targets were Blanco Irco,

head of military intelligence;

Taberinalla, head of the

army; Usalace, chief of police. (pp. 47, 48, 49, 50)

HH 53080 DocId:32248213 Page 5

## Page 6

Summary of Deposition

Victor Espinosa

Page Two

Espinosa's group, with Cubela and Pedro Carbo, was

immediately successful, killing Blanco Irco within the

week of their assignment.

Although not suspected at

first, Cubela nevertheless fled to Miami, while Espinosa,

the youngest and least suspect, remained

in Cuba.

Cubela

eventually returned in 1957, and fought Batista from the

Sierra Maestra Mountains, independently of Castro. (pp. 51, 52)

Thus by late 1957, there were three groups fighting

Batista: Castro's group in Oriente Province, William

Morgan's group and Cubela's group.. Castro wanted control

over all the groups, and having Morgan under control, sent

Che Guevara to consolidate the other "fronts". Guevara's

mission was first to assassinate Rolando Menoyo, then Cubela.

By October of 1958, Guevara had taken Menoyo and Cubela into

custody, but released them after four days. (pp. 54, 55)

When Batista abdicated in January of 1959, Castro's

group was

the only one left intact as the others had been

decimated by fighting, especially Cubela's after an assault

on the Presidential Palace. As Espinosa described the scene,

"no one knew what to do; we were fighting a war and the war

was over; we didn;t have any ambition of power. Our aim was

to get the guy (Batista), when these people's (Castro's) aims

were very well planned for far ahead."

(p. 56)

Thus by late 1959, with Castro in power, Espinosa,

seeing

the student movement ending, left for the United States

and exile, (p. 58) (especially after Espinosa had been ar-

rested by Castro for attempting to smuggle the entire contents

of an army arsenal to Panama and was released only after

Cubela's intervention).

(pp. 57-59)

II.

Espinosa's Relationship with Mike MCLaney

A. 1954-1959

Espinosa often frequented the gambling casinos in

Havana while a student at the University of Havana.

Through

a social friend, FNU Callejas, who was the manager of the

Hotel Nacional,

Espinosa was

introduced to Bil1 McLaney,

brother of Mike, and then through Bill,. to

Mike.

Their

relationship, according to Espinosa, was purely social during

the remainder of their years in Cuba, not involving any

clandestine activities directed at either Batista or Castro.

Espinosa is not aware of any activities of that nature by

either of the McLaneys during this time.

(pp. 9, 10)

Summary of Deposition

Page Three

B. 1959-1963

Under

the sponsorship of McLaney, Espinosa left Cuba

in 1959

for Miami.

While he may have initially stayed at

McLaney's

home, he soon began

living with his family in

Miami.

It is not known why Espinosa moved to New York in

1960, but his return to Miami later in 1960 was occasioned

by his desire to join his former colleagues in training for

the Bay of Pigs invasion. (pp. 9-12)

Espinosa left the "employ" of the CIA in August of

1961* (See Section III, P. 4); he returned to Miami.

In

Juné of 1963 Espinosa was detained by FBI and Customs agents

in Miami for an attempted bombing raid on Cuba. According

to Espinosa, McLaney sponsored Espinosa and a few of his

associates in a plan to bomb the Shell Oil refineries in

Havana.

In this group were Sam Benton, Carlos Hernandez

Sanchez, John Koch Gene, Acleo Pedrosa Amores, Miguel Al-

varez and Richard Albert Lauchli.

Benton procured an air-

plane, Espinosa the explosives from Lauchli, and McLaney

supplied the financing.

(pp. 16-22) An informant within

the group alerted the FBI which was waiting with Customs

officials as the group rendezvoused for the mission.

When

this mission failed, another one was immediately put into

operation.

The oil refineries were again the targets, but

the plan

was to leave from

a deserted airstrip in the

vicinity of Lake Ponchartrain, Louisiana, using either a

B-25 or

a B-26 bomber, fully operational.

Again Espinosa

planned the operation and secured the explosives through

Lauchli. This time, McLaney was to provide the airplane,

and only inform the

group of its location once the bombs

were ready for loading.

(pp. 23-29, 91, 92)

As was the case for the June 15th mission, this one

was also a failure.

One

member of the group was recalled

to Miami due to a death in the family, the remaining members,

feeling this would breach their security, disbanded, re-

turning to Miami with Espinosa going to New York to report

to Mike McLaney.

On July 31, 1963, the FBI discovered the

cache of explosives to be used on the mission at a farm house

at Lake Ponchartrain owned by Mike McLaney's brother Bill,

Espinosa remained in New York until approximately

1967, when he moved to France.

He remained there until 1969,

53080 DocId: 32248213 Page 7

then went into business in Spain and England. He stated he

has had no contact with McLaney since 1965, his last anti-

Castro involvement with McLaney being the aborted July 1963

raid on the oil refineries in Havana. (p. 29)

III.

Espinosa's Contact With the CIA

During his anti-batista activity in Cuba from 1954

through 1959, Espinosa was aware that certain persons in his

"group" had some contact with the American Embassy in Havana,

and that a number of individuals working in Castro's or-

ganization had similar contacts with the CIA. Espinosa had

no contact with the CIA until he reached Miami in 1959 and

joined the Bay of Pigs training force.

Espinosa was

made

aware of training being conducted

to invade Cuba upon his arrival. He left word with friends

to keep him informed and went to New York to work. A short

while later he was contacted, and immediately returned to

enlist.

Espinosa was sent to Guatemala in June or July of

1960 to begin the training. (pp. 10, 11)

In Guatemala and later Panama and New Orleans,

Espinosa was trained in conventional military warfare,

guerrilla warfare, explosives and clandestine operations.

As a result of this training, Espinosa did partici-

pate in various raids into Cuba, some of which were aimed

at the destruction of military targets, others with:the

purpose of gathering information and bringing individuals

out. These activities began before the Bay of Pigs invasion

and continued through the following summer of 1961.

(pp.

14-16) *It should be noted that Espinosa stated that he

was able to obtain from a friend in the government his file

which details each of these operations and the participants;

however, in our review of files on Espinosa, we find records

showing

that Espinosa was terminated from involvement in

March of 1961 and taken off the payroll.)

IV.

Espinosa's Involvement With the AMLASH Operation

Espinosa's activities with the CIA ceased as of late

summer 1961. (p. 62)

In approximately June of 1965, while

NH 53080

## Page 9

Summary of Deposition

Victor Espinosa

Page Five

on a pleasure excursion to Paris from his residence in

New York, Espinósa contacted an old acquaintance, Jose

Trasancos

who was at the time working for the Cuban

Consulate in Paris, having been in a position there since

approximately 1962 or 1963.

Trasancos

spoke of having seen Cubela in Paris and

"something was going on...Rolando (Cubela) is involved with

the CIA and there is something happening." (p. 63) Tras-

ancos wanted Espinosa to get the complete story from

George Robreno, a former member of the Student Revolu-

tionary Movement in Havana, and long-time friend of

Cubela. Robreno at one time had been with the Castro

government as the head of the revolutionary tribunals which

out many death sentences.

(p. 64) Originally,

Espinosa intended to meet with Robreno in Madrid, but after

encountering difficulties obtaining a visa, was forced at

his

own

expense to send Robreno an airline ticket for

Paris.

(p. 65)

In Paris, Robreno told Espinosa that Cubela had been

talking

with certain CIA people about an uprising in Cuba

against Castro that was to be led by Cubela and others of-

ficials in the government and the army.

Cubela had been in

contact with an individual named williamson who was the

head of the CIA in Spain.

Cubela was most concerned about

Williamson's trustworthiness, expressing as a basis, Wil-

liamson's apparent alcoholism and the fact that he had had

as a mistress a Cuban female who had taken certain important

documents from Williamson's apartment to Castro.

had wanted

his old associate Espinosa to contact his "CIA

colleagues", still believing Espinosa was with the CIA.

Espinosa was to explain Cubela's position to them viz-a-viz

Cubela's contact with Williamson.

In addition.to this con-

versation with Robreno, Espinosa

met with (Alberto) Blanco,

"El Loco", also involved in the plot with Cubela. Blanco, en

route to Cuba from Russia via Czechoslovakia, mentioned

the

presence of Russian technicians in Cuba, stating that he

wanted the CIA to know that if they were thinking of double-

crossing Cubela, "They (Cubela and his associates in the

plot) would take care of these Russian technicians".

(pp.

67, 68)

It was Espinosa's understanding that Cubela had come

to Madrid sometime earlier to meet with Artime and william-

son.

According to Robreno, Artime was soliciting Cubela's

aid

in a different coup.

Cubela could not trust Artime,

feeling he was working both sides with the CIA and Castro.

Espinosa returned to New York the week following

his meeting with Robreno in Paris and went directly to

Cavasantos of Immigration and Naturalization to be put in

contact with someone in the CIA.

Cavasantos sent Espinosa

to the FBI in New York, where they were joined by someone

from the CIA, whom Espinosa felt was aware of the individuals

mentioned in the AMLASH operation.

(pp. 70-72, 76) Espinosa

related Cubela's message and was told he would

be contacted

within a few days.

(p. 73)

After two weeks, Espinosa con-

tacted a friend who worked for Senator Javits who arranged

for a meeting in Washington with a State Department

official involved with Cuban affairs.

Feeling that he had done all he could do, Espinosa

returned to New York, where he worked for the next two

years before moving to France and Spain. (pp. 77, 78)

Sometime later, Espinosa learned of Cubela's

arrest and imprisonment in Cuba and was most surprised that

Cubela was not executed. (p. 79)

V.

Individuals of Interest Known to Espinosa

A.

Norman Rothman: Espinosa met Rothman in Havana

sometime in the late 1950's, possibly in the casino at the

Hotel Nacional, and later in approximately 1960 or 1961 in

Miami at the Biltmore Hotel.

Espinosa was a social acquaintance of "Cappy"

Rothman, Norman's son, in Miami from approximately 1960-

1963.

(pp. 31, 32, 98-101)

B.

Meyer Lansky: While Espinosa did not know

Meyer Lansky, he did see him at the Rivera Casino in

Havana. (p.

97)

Raphael Garcia Bongo: Trafficante's attorney.

Espinosa knew Jorta Bongo, the brother of Raphael, and

through him met Raphael.

While not first-hand, it was common

knowledge that Raphael was Trafficante's attorney in Cuba.

Approximately five years ago, Espinosa

• learned that Raphael

had been arrested in Spain for passing counterfeit money.

Espinosa heard that the counterfeit money was linked to

Trafficante. (pp. 103-105)

Sam Benton: Knew him through McLaney. Benton

was supplier for the aircraft used on the two aborted oil

refinery raids in 1963. (pp. 18, 19, 23, 93)

E.

Raul Castro: Espinosa met Raul on two occasions

in Havana soon after Castro's takeover.

Espinosa

was present

in Cubela's hospital room when Raul Castro visited Cubela.

Mr. Blackmer. Did he

have any specific knowledge of

3

Mr. Espinosa. I think Miguel Alvarez got them.

4

Mr. Blackmer. Can you tell us a little bit about what

5 the plan was for this bombing raid?

6

Mr. Espinosa. Well, the plan was to try to get the

7 refinery out of

service or out of production so instead of

8 bringing crude oil into the country and be refined in Cuba,

9 they would have to bring in the gasoline. So, that would have

10 made a very easy target for us in order to blow up the tankers

11 or whatever vessels were used to bring in the gasoline.

12.

Mr. Blackmer. Were you aware that any of these vessels

13 that were carrying oil to Cuba may have been flying a Russian

14 flag?

15

Mr. Espinosa. No, this was a hypothetical thing at the

16 time.

17

Mr. Blackmer. It was not your intention at that time to

18 provoke an incident between the U.S. and Russia?

19

Mr. Espinosa.

No, that would have stopped us from

20 blowing up the Russian ship.

Mr. Blackmer. And what specifically was that business?

2

Mr. Espinosa. It was--there were industrial inspectors

3 who used to inspect sugar refineries, alcohol and places where

4 alcohol was being made and gasoline refineries, or oil

5. refineries, et cetera.

6

Mr. Blackmer. And you had personally gone over this

7 particular refinery?

8

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, as a younger man I used to go there

with inspectors sometimes to make some pocket money or

10 something.

11

•Mr.. Blackmer. A part-time job?

12

Mr. Espinosa.: A part time job, yes.

13

Mr. Blackmer. Did you talk McLaney into financing this

14 operation?

15.

Mr: Espinosa. Yes.

16

Mr. Blackmer. And did you know what his particular

17 interest was in seeing this operation successfully. completed?

18

Mr.: Espinosa. Well, I mean, first we have to say that if

19 the operation was successful, perhaps we had a chance to

20 economically cripple the country and consequently bring about

21 a change in the politics. Of course, a change in the

22 political situation at the time would have been a favorable

23 change for Mr. McLaney's economics or business out there.

24

Mr. Blackmer. So, McLaney was personally interested in

25 regaining some of his possessions in Cuba.

1

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, exactly like that.

2

Mr. Blackmer. Do you know if he was involved in any of

3 the internal politics in Cuba in the sense--do you know if he

4 was sponsoring any particular exile leaders who could possibly

5 in the foreseeable future go back to Cuba and take over once

6 Castro was eliminated?

7

Mr. Espinosa. I don't

know that.. I don't think so.

8

Mr. Blackmer. So, is it your opinion that Mr. McLaney

9 was doing what little he could and hoping that others would do

10 a little and add to the possible fall of the Castro regime?

11

Mr. Espinosa. Exactly.

12

Mr. Blackmer. In July of 1963 outside of New Orleans,

13 Louisianna, a large catch of dynamite and home-made bombs were

14 found in the home of Bill MeLaney. Could you tell us what you

15 know about that catch of arms that was discovered?

16

Mr. Espinosa. It was taken there by me and it was to be.

17

used in other raids.

19

Mr. Blackmer. A similar raid?

Mr. Espinosa. As the one that was in Cuba.

20

Mr. Blackmer. I understand that some of the people that

21 participated with you in the June 15 attempt also participated

22 with you in the July attempt.

23

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.

Mr. Espinosa. In Colesville, Illinois.

Mr. Blackmer. Did you then go with him to pick up

Mr. Espinosa. First, we picked up the explosives but we

16 left them at the place where he had them and then we went on

18 from the heads of 61 millimeter mortar shells or 60 millimeter

Mr. Blackmer. After the Bay of Pigs, what was

the

4 they were very disappointed and were many of them violently

5 angry against Kennedy himself or the U.S. Government?

6

Mr. Espinosa. Not really against him, against

the CIA

7 mainly or against the government and not against Kennedy.

8

Mr. Blackmer. What was their general feeling as the

9. cause of the failure of the Bay of Pigs?

10

Mr.

11

Mr. Blackmer. How do you mean?

12

13

1.4

Mr. Espinosa. Well, should I go into this a little?

Mr. Blackmer. Yes, I think so.

Mr. Espinosa. When the question was risen by the pilots

15 in Guatemala, if you are going to go to the Bay, go in with a

16 B-25 or B-26. B-26, let us say, is a tactical bomber plane

17 and now this kind of plane, if I remember, it has eight

18 50-caliber machine guns in the nose and two in the tail and so

19

on .

• 20

And in order for this plane to fly from Guatemala to Cuba

21. and be able to have a feeder for 30 minutes operation in the

22 area and bomb or machine gun for 30 minutes and come back to

23 Guatemala, all of this ammunition and all of the machine guns

have to be taken from the plane and put additional gasoline

25 tanks in.

36

So, the question was aroused--and how do you say in

2 English--it was raised of what happens when we get there

3 without any fighter protection and the planes are going to be

4 in the air and they are going to be knocked down?

5.

So, the answer to that was that there were going to be

6 two or three bombing raids and one in San Antonio Bay in

7 Havana and another one in another place and another one in

8 Valdo Beach at the airport and just destroy it and make it a

9 pretentious strike and destroy Castro's air force

on the

10 ground.

11

So, everybody was very content with this explanation and

12 the strike took over and Roa, who was a Cuban ambassador to

13 the United Nations, made a big fuss at the time.

So, there

14 was a big fuss in the United Nations and they came up with the

15 pictures of the planes, and..then it was found that this story

16 that the air force had been bombed by Cuban pilots belonging

17: to Fidel Castro's army who had defected, it was a lie because

•18 the models of the Cuban planes were a different model, liké

1 the third raid, so consequently we lost all of the planes.

2

Mr. Blackmer. Is that one of the specific reasons why

3 the invasion failed?

4

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, I would think so.

5

Mr. Blackmer. Because Castro's air force was able to

6 annihilate the bombers and also the supply ships?

7

Mr. Espinosa. As long as we had a boat we could really

8 take and maintain a piece of land over there until the forces

9: of the Organization of American States would come in, and as I-

WeRe

10 understood by friends of mine who

wee there,

all of the ships,

11 the battle ships were right there and the carrier and the

12: whole thing.

13

So, I guess the whole thing was that somehow people

14 thought it was

as usual, the usual CIA screwed up thing, and

15 they thought it was. Stevenson who really precipitated the

16 whole thing. But nobody--maybe because they were sympathetic,

but nobody bothered about blaming Kennedy for it.

18

Mr. Blackmer. So, it was your feeling at the time that

19 the CIA was noted for inefficient operationspend In your

20 training, did you feel like you were given imadequate and ima

Mr. Espinosa. As I said to you the other day, I did, and

So, what I am saying is, as I said to you the other day,

If we had gotten in there in

8•

Mr. Espinosa, They wage all heroes, even if they never

9 saw a gun in their lives.

They are all heroes and so you have

10 to blame things on other people and not on yourselves and the

11 main reason why we failed should fall upon our shoulders to

12 begin with.

÷13

Mr. Blackmer.

It is your testimony: then that you

14 participated in an infiltration before the Bay of Pigs and

15 after the Bay of Pigs you were on three or four more

16 infiltrations into Cuba?

17: : Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.

18

Mr. Blackmer.

And as I recall, what we are trying to do

19 today is get on the record all of the things we had discussed

20 in our interview with your and so you betieve at that former

21 interview you stated

22

Mr. Espinosa. Let me tell you something.

There was a

23. file somewhere with the days and the people that went into

24. this infiltration and you didn't do that because I have seen

25 it many, many years ago.

Mr. Blackmer.

Where exactly did you see this file?

2

Mr. Espinosa. I saw it and I was going with

somebody who

3 was a civil servant and he showed it to me as a favor but I

4 know there is a file.

5.

Mr. Blackmer. And this file you saw, where was it, in

6 Miami?

7

8

Mr. Espinosa. No, I didn't see it in Miami.

Mr. Blackmer. Would you like to tell us where you saw

9 it?

10

Mr. Espinosa. No.

11

Mr. Blackmer. And to your knowledge it details each one

12 of the operations that you personally were involved in?

13

Mr. Espinosa.. Yes, and the persons involved and friends

14 of mine and people, involved in the other operations with me

15 from the CIA and the whole thing.

'16

Mr. Blackmer. Is it your feeling that, as you expressed

17 the other day, that these subsequent operations were merely

18 done by the CIA just to keep control or taps on sómé of the

19 tra? Cubans?

20

Mr. Espinosa. Either that or to get us killed, one thing

21 or the other.

22

Mr. Blackmer. And you felt that the operations them-

23 selves were meaningless?

24

Mr. Espinosa. Not only that; you two have been in the

25 army, is that right? And you know, you can understand that.

1 Anyway, if you have a box of 30 caliber machine gun

2 ammunition, you know exactly, you know when you open the

3 ammunition box you are going to find the required ammunition

4 and when you start going on the operation and you open up a 30

5 caliber munitions box and you start finding 45 caliber

6 ammunition, you start wondering because these things come: like

7 that.

8.

After a few years they take them away because it is like

9 a prescription in a pharmacy and they deliver them to you from

10 an army camp or from an army depot or something, and what it

11 says outside, believe me, you will find inside.

12

If you do not find inside what is outside, if you do not

13. find it, you wonder who changed it and why was it changed?

14

Mr. Blackmer. How large were the groups that you

15 infiltrated with?

16

Mr. Espinosa. Small groups, three or four.

17

19

Mr. Blackmer.

And were you parachuted in or were you

22 Carol and there was Siva--the last name and I cannot remember

23 the first name, and they were in a CIA mission in cuba and

2

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you state the first time that you met

3 Rolando Cubela and what your relationship was with him in

4

Cuba?

5

Mr. Espinosa. I must have met Rolando when I was about

12 or 13 years old because he used to go, or we used to have a

very good protestant school in the city in which I was, born.

8 And a lot of people from all over Cuba used to

go there to get

9 an education.

10

He was going to this school and I met him at that time;

11 and I was 12 or 13 and he must have been 15 or 16 years old

at

12 that tine.

13

Mr. Hornbeck. Were you friendly with any of his

14 relatives and was he friendly with any of your relatives?

15

Mr. Espinosa.

I was friendly with his father and with

16 his mother and mainly

with his brother, and his father, I saw

17 him and he was always lost somewhere and I was very friendly

18 with his mother and with his sister, Cari.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. After this first schooling with Rolando,

20 did you continue to stay in contact with him?

21.

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, mainly because he was a very good

Jose

22 friend of Hosea Antonio Echeverria.

23

Mr. Hornbeck. And I take it. Echeverria was a good friend

24 of yours?

25

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, we used to live about 20 minutes from

2

Mr. Hornbeck. Did the three of you attend

any schools of

3 higher education?

4

Mr. Espinosa. We all went to the University of Havana.

5

Mr. Hornbeck. Were all three of you there at

6 approximately the same time?

7

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, they were there before I was there

8 and by the time I got there they were big shots already.

9

Mr. Hornbeck, What was Cubela's course of study at the

10 University and what political activities at the University was

11 he engaged in?

12

Mr. Espinosa. It is funny, Rolando started to be a

13 doctor and he was studying to be a doctor.

14.

Mr. Hornbeck. You are speaking of a medical doctor?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, and I do not know whether he:

16 graduated or not and his political activities were very, very

17 limited in the sense that he would sort of follow the

18 activities of Antonio mainly.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. And was this their pattern at the

20 University when you arrived, that Echeverria was a real leader

21 and Cubela was associated with him?

22

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

23

Mr. Hornbeck. What year did you first enter the

24 University?

25

Mr. Espinosa. 1954.

2

Mr. Espinosa. Dictatorship, democracy and the trouble we

3 were having with a dictator. you don't like and the Cubans have

4. Castro now.

5

Mr. Hornbeck. Who was the dictator at that time?

6

Mr. Espinosa. Batista.

7

Mr. Hornbeck. And who were the students supporting if

there was anyone candidate?

9

Mr. Espinosa. What is that?

10

Mr. Hornbeck. Who did the students support or was it

11 just against Batista?

12

Mr. Espinosa. Mainly the last president, Prio. There

13 was a lot of good nature and idealogical politicking in the

14 University, and there was a lot of politicking done by other

15 guys who had been in the University for a long time and the

16 kind of students who never graduated, professional students,

17 and I think prio was to butter them up and keep them flaming,

18 and there were different sections.

19

But in general, everybody liked prio and there was a

20 democratic government and here came Castro and he screwed it

21 up.

Mr. Hornbeck. When you left the University, were Cubela

23 and Echeverria still at the University?

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

Mr. Hornbeck. Did there come a time when you joined them

47

1 in any anti-castro activity or anti-Batista activities?

2

Mr. Espinosa. I will explain to you. I was

in the

3 University for one year and I didn't study, and

all we did the

4 whole time was just trying to get something going against

5 Batista. There were so many clashes with the police and

6 people shot and this and that.

7

And my father took me out and sent me to LSU. I stayed

8 there one year and then I became of age, 18, and my grand-

9 father died, and so I decided to quit and go on and take over

10 the ranch that my grandfather had left me at the time.

11

So, I went over there

and minding my own business and

12 working and not messing in politics and I used to spend three

13 or four weeks over there or 40 days and then go to Havana for

14 a weekend or three or four days. And then one time I went to

15 Havana and Rolando called me and he had just--or Antonio had

16 just been to Mexico to see Castro and they had a meeting in

17 Mexico.

18

So, he said, "we are going to have a meeting with about

Jose ANtONiO

19.10 or 12 guys in the University and Hosanna told me to call

20: you."

21

Mr. Hornbeck.

Can you tell us approximately what year

22

this was?

1956

23

Mr. Espinosa.

This was the day before Colonel

24 Blanco was shot, the day before he was shot.

25

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you identify what position he held?

Mr. Hornbeck. Blanco.

3

Mr. Espinosa.. He was head of military intelligence.

4

Mr. Hornbeck: Under the Batista regime?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

6

Mr. Hornbeck.: And

that day, what ---

7

Mr. Espinosa. That day Rolando called me and he said, i.

"We are going to meet at the square in the University àt 1:10

Dose aNtONIo

9 o'clock, and Hosanna told me to call you." And so I got over

10 there and we were

about 10 or 12 guys, and Castro was going to

11 come and he sent me regards from the guy who was killed and we

12 had to start really cracking and getting things done over

13 there, like shooting the big guys or chief of police and so on

14 and military intelligence and all of that.

15

So, we made three groups of four people each

and I can

16 remember who was there in case you want the names but I don't,

17 think it is of interest to you because most of them are dead,

18 and maybe except for Rolando.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. If you can remember the groups and what

20 targets those particular groups had.

21

Mr. Espinosa. The people who were there were Rolando,

22 Antonio, Machin and Machado.

Was that his first name?

4 all of the people that were there.

5

Mr. Hornbeck. So, did the groups divide into these four

6 areas with specific targets in mind?

7

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, one group was going to take care of

8 Usalace who was chief of police and we were the youngest ones

9 and we got the easiest one, who was Blanco Irco, and then the

10 others were together going to take care of Taberinalla.

11

Mr. Hornbeck, What position did he hold?

12.

Mr. Espinosa. The army chief.

• Mr. Hornbeck. Were any of these groups successful in

14 carrying out their targets?

15 Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

16

Mr. Hornbeck. Of the groups, which ones were successful?

Mr. Espinosa. Our group; we were the one who got lucky

18 first.

19.

Mr. Hornbeck. What was to be your particular role in the

20 assassination of Blanco Irco?

21

Mr. Espinosa. Just to stay in the car and worked with a

22 gun over there to see if someone was coming.

23

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you describe just briefly what

24 occurred the day he was killed?

Mr. Espinosa. Rolando called me and I was. not at home.

1 I was at my girlfriend's, and it was a Saturday, and he called

2 me over there and he wanted to pick me up and we took my car

3

and we picked up two guys and a hand grenade.

4

Mr. Hornbeck. Rifles or pistols?

• 5

Mr. Espinosa. Two pistols, one 45 and one a Spanish

6 Start, and

then we went

to pick up Carbo, Pedro Carbo--that is

7 the last name and we gave each other a rendezvous at 10:00

:8 o'clock. I left Rolando at his home and I went home and I

9 took a nap and I took a shower and I went there at: 10:00

10 o'clock and they were not there.

11

So, I went to three or four different places where we

12 were supposed to be because the guy was supposed to be there,

13 and I thought maybe I was late or they were early. I thought

14 it was my fault and I couldn't find him and about half past 12

15 or 10:00 o'clock, I said, "Well, nothing happened," and I

16 don't know what happened and I went to sleep. The next

17 morning I just heard on the radio that they got the guy.

18

Mr. Hornbeck. After that particular event, what kind of

19 activities against the Batista regine did you engage in with

20 Rolando and Echeverria?

21

Mr. Espinosa. Let me try to synchronize because then I

22 had to leave the country.

1 and they were thinking of old gangsters, and some of his

2 professional students that were there.

Actually, I think that

3 they got Cubela but anyway. at that time he was out of the

4 country.

Mr. Hornbeck. Do you know where he went?

6

Mr. Espinosa. He went to Miami. I think for a long time

7:I didn't see him and the other people were trying to carry on

8 with their targets, and I wasn't in contact with Antonio for

9 about a year. Then, he called me one day and we had a meeting

10 and we were talking about making an assault on the Presi-

11: dential Palace and that is the last time that I saw him.

12..

Mr. Hornbeck.: Approximately what was the plan date of

13: the assault on the palace?

14

Mr. Espinosa.. I think he got a letter--I am sure--from

15 Castro that he showed to all of us who were there at that

16 meeting that day, and the letter was saying, "Well, after 120

17 days or 90 days or 200 days that I have been in the Sierra

18 Mastros, in the hills, you haven't done anything yet.".

19

It was a kind of a letter that was really trying to make

20 him

feel like a shit, and I know this was a much more

21 complicated thing and it was only going to be the students who

22 were going to do it.

23

Then, in came people from other organizations and.

24 relatives in the other organizations, the far right, and

25 ex-politicians like Sandro and people like that and I saw him

that day and he said,. "I will be in touch with you," and h

never got in touch with me.

3

Mr. Hornbeck. Did there come a time when Cubela returned

4 to Miami?

5

Mr: Espinosa. Yes.

6

7 was?

8

Mr. Espinosa. It must have been the end of 1957.

9

Mr. Hornbeck. And from the period?

10.

Mr. Espinosa. It was the middle of '57, three or four

11 months after that time of the Presidential Palace.

12

Mr. Hornbeck. From the period of mid '57 through the

13 first part of 1959, what was your association with Cubela?

14

Mr.. Espinosa. You see, everybody was so burned up all of

15 the time in Havana, everybody had to go to the hills and I had

16 a very good relationship with the son of the actual president

17 of the senate in Cuba at the time, and he was a very good

18 friend of mine.

19

20

Mr. Hornbeck. Who was that?

Mr. Espinosa. Alfred Gonzales.

21

Mr. Hornbeck. Would you tell us about the old man first?

22

Mr. Espinosa. The old man was Anselmo Alliegro and he

23. was president of the Senate at the time, and he was one of the:

24 big shots.

I met his step-son when I was in Louisianna State

25 and we were close friends.

2

Mr. Hornbeck. They were fighting independently?

Mr. spinosa.

Independently, and trying to get to Havana

3 before Castro did, and so you have an idea

what the realities

4. were at the time, when Castro sent Che Guevara from Oriente

Province to the Province of Santa Clara. And I think that he

6 had 150 or 160 men.

7

In Santa Clara there were plenty of people fighting,

8 because this was not

such an isolated place as Oriente was,

9 and it was not only the student group; there was also the

10 people of the william Morgan group which were the

third front,

11 and they alone with 2,500 people. But Castro

wanted to have a

12 chair over there somehow to control the situation, and one.of

13 the things, or the orders was to dispose of Rolando Menoya.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. You are saying one of the missions of Che

15 Guevara was to eliminate or kill both Menoya and Cubela so

16 thät Castro would be the only leader?

17

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

18

Mr. Hornbeck. How do you have that information?

19

Mr. Espinosa. From Cubela and from other people who were

20 there at the time, because the thing is that somenow they

found out by some of the students from the University of

22 Oriente who were with Castro.

Mr. Hornbeck. Was there any confrontation with either

24. Che Guevara or Castro?

Mr. Espinosa. Che arrived there and took him and put him

1 under custody. So there was another thing back and forth from

2 Oriente to Santa Clara until the suy was relieved, but he was

3 three or four days under custody.

4

Mr. Hornbeck. Approximately what time period was this;

5 can you pinpoint that for us?

6

Mr. Espinosa. This would have been October, September or

7 October of 1958.

8

Mr. Hornbeck. Batista leaves lavana approximately the

9 first of January of 1959?

10

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

11.

Mr. Hornbeck. What arrangements, if any, were made

12 between the various groups then?

13

Mr. Espinosa. : Nothing.

14

• Mr. Hornbeck. How did it come about that Fidel Castro

15 then came to power and Cubela and Menoya and some of the other

16

leaders did not come to power?

17

Mr. Espinosa. I don't know. I always wondered about

18. that myself. And as I said to you, I used to be in the

19 hospital room with Rolando at the time when he was wounded,

20 when he

was going through the operation with the arm, and I

21 was there when Castro came to see him, and when che came to

22 see him and Raul Castro came to see him, and when the other

23 leaders from the student groups came to see him... They had

24 discussions about this and, first of all, they were all.

1 course, and they knew exactly what we were doing and we didn't

2 know exactly what we were doing. We were fighting

a war and

3 once the war was over, we didn't know what. to do and we didn't

4 have any ambition of power.

And when I say "we," I don't count and I am talking about

6 the people who were there; mostly I am talking about Rolando,

7 and there was no ambition of power or any of that. There was

8 just to get the guy out and that is it. Our aim was to stop,

9 when these people's aims were very well planned for far ahead.

10

Mr. Hornbeck.. Did there come

a time when you and Cubela.

11 split as to your views of Castro?

12

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

13

Mr. Hornbeck.: Can you tell us approximately when that

14 happened, and can you describe how you came apart?

15

Mr. Espinosa. well, as I said at the beginning, when he

16 came into lavana, immediately they called me and they said,

17 "Rolando is going to be here in about one hour and they want

18 you to be at the University. "

19

He came in 15 or 20 minutes late, and he said to me, I

20 think we are going to have a lot of problems with Castro and

21 the 26th of July as a symbolic thing, because so many of our

22 friends got killed on the attack of the Presidential Palace,

23 and Antonio was killed that day, and not there out another

24 part of Havana, and we went and took the Presidential Palace

25 as a gesture and a symbolic thing.

57

The first two or three months we were together all of the

2 time. Then I started disagreeing with him on things, and I

3

guess I was a wise ass at the time, especially about the

4 things that we were letting Castro get away with, especially

where he had to take

absolute power over everything and we

6 were getting bull shit in return. And the fact was ! never

I liked the guy; and as a matter of fact, I hated him, and I

8 never knew his politics because I don't know.

9

Some people find

out their wives or girls are fooling

10 around with somebody else for two or three years, and jüst

11 from the beginning I thought this was going the wrong way.

SO

12 I started having arguments with Rolando and asking for

13 explanations from him, because this was not what we fought for

14 and not what our friends died for, and "So you are becoming an

15 accomplice of Castro and I cannot understand this."

16

He said, "Why do you say. that, and why are you putting up

17 with this?"

18

I said, "And they are taking land away from people and

19 they are shooting soldiers who never shot in the whole war and

20 just shooting them and there was no trial, and. I have seen the

21 trials and they were mockeries, and whether they were guilty

22: or not guilty, they got shot and that is it."

23

So he wouldn't give me the right answers,

and he would

24 say, "well, there is a revolution." And I said, "I don't

25 understand that, Rolando, and I don't understand it, and I

NW 53080 DocId: 32248213 Page 70

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

---

## Page 71

58

I don't understand the things that are happening, and you are

2 being an accomplice because you are in a position to do

3 something and you are not doing anything, and you are playing

4 his ball game."

5

In the beginning we discussed these matters, and then we

started getting

very close in, and I really didn't understand

7 it. And to the point one day we had a discussion in my house

8. and he told my mother, "When your son goes to jail, then call

9 me," and I said, "I won't call you."

10

11

Mr. Hornbeck. Rolando said that to your mother?

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

12

Mr. Hornbeck. Approximately when did you leave Havana?

13

•Mr. Espinosa. I left Havana in 1959.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. When in 1959?

15

Mr. Espinosa. I don't know if it was October or

16 September or November; somewhere between October and Decenber.

•17

Mr. Hornbeck. During the period of time that you came to

18 the United States

and went to train in the Bay of Pigs and

19 came back to the United States; did you have any contact with

20 Cubela?

21

Mr. Espinosa. Well, some guys and myself, we thought at

22. the time we were allowed to go to South America and I and some

23 others were

going to Panama or Nicaragua, and so we got the

24 idea -- and there is one thing I forgot to tell you.

25

At the beginning when things began, there was a lot of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY: INC;

HH 53080 DOOId:32248213 Page 71

## Page 72

59

1 friction with the 2oth of July, and we took all of the weapons

2 from an arsenal in

some base outside of Havana, and it must

3 have been 500M-1 rifles and a few 50-caliber machine guns and

4 copule of hundred of Thompson submachine guns, and some

5 mortars, a 190 tank gun, and somehow all of the things were

6 hidden by me.

7

Rolando told me to hide it in a place, that we were going

8 to need it one day. So I hid it in my house, and we had a

9 very big house, so big that when they came looking for these

they couldn't find it because it was like an old castle and

11

there were like hidden doors, hidden panels and things like

12 that.

13

They came looking for it and they didn't find it, and so

14 about two or three weeks after that I put the whole thing in a

15 truck and took it to a resort very near to where I was born,

16 in Varadero.

17

So I took it over there and we decided, a few guys who

18 were going to do something, go to the hills or do something,

19 and we came out with this idea. to go to some other country and

20

do something so we could get away and cover our activities.

21

We got caught.

22

Mr. Hornbeck. By whom?

23

Mr. Espinosa. By Castro.

24

Ne got caught, and we were taken to Military

25 Intelligence, and there were about six or seven of us,

1 they got all the weapons. Someone squealed and they

2 infiltrated somebody in the group.

And I don't know what was

3 going to happen, but it was a little bit scary at the time,

4 and so we were uncommunicated

for several days and we were

5 questioned, and we were sticking to our story we going to

6 Guatemala or someplace else.

And I can't remember now, and

7 Rolando was in Spain and my mother called him and he came over

8 and he got us out.

9

• Mr. Hornbeck. Was there any particular reason he was in

10 Spain at that time?

11

Mr. Espinosa. He was a playboy.

12

Mr. Hornbeck. It had nothing to do with Castro?

13

Mr. Espinosa. No. He went over there to have a good

14 time, and so actually the threat that he made,. "Call me and I

15 will help you," and my mother called him and he came

over and

• 16 he got us out.

17

, Mr. Hornbeck.

After your period in the United States,

18 did you have any contreet with him?

19

•Mr. Espinosa. No. The only time I had contact was when

20. I told you that I went to Paris and these people contacted me.

21 Mr. Hornbeck. I am going to get to that,

and I want to

22 establish. whether or not, during the years that you were

in

23 the United States and training for the Bay of Pigs and were in

24 New York, that you had no direct contact with him and did you

25. have any indirect contact through mutual friends?

Mr. Espinosa. I went to Paris in 1964 or 1965.

Mr. Hornbeck. Would it help you to know --

13

Mr. Espinosa. I think it was 1964 or :65.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. would it refresh your nemory that,

15 according to government records, you came to New York and

16 first contacted Immigration sometime approximately in June or

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.

Mr. Hornbeck. Now would your New York trip then help

22 and I contacted them immediately, and so this must have been

Mr. Hornbeck. You were engaged at that time in no anti-

3 Castro activities?

4

Mir. Espinosa.

Nothing.

5

Mr. Hornbeck. You were not working for the CIA at that

6

time?

7

Mr. Espinosa. No.

8

Mr. Hornbeck. Approximately when did you end your

9 services or employment with the CIA?

10

Mr. Espinosa. I would say in the end of 1951.

11

Mr. Hornbeck. When you arrived in Paris, did you have a

12 contact who gave you some information about Cubela?

13

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

14:

Mr. Hornbeck. What was the name of that contact?.

15

Mr. Espinosa. Jose Irasancos.

16

Mr. Hornbeck. How long had you known Jose Irascancos?

17

Mr. Espinosa. All of my life.

18

Mr. Hornbeck. What was his position in Paris at the time

19 that you met him in 1965?

20

Mr. Espinosa. He was working at the Cuban Consulate:

Mr. Hornbeck. How long had he been with the Cuban

22 Consulate in Paris, if you know?

23

Mr. Espinosa. I don't know, but for a couple of years or

24 three at the time.

25

Mr. Hornbeck. I assume by the fact that he was working

abroad in the Cuban Consulate that he enjoyed some confidence

2 with the Castro government?

3

Mr. Espinosa. I don't know about that. I think at the

4 time the government wasn't established enough to really clamp

5 down on the people that they should or should not have in

their consulates, and there were so many things to put

I together over there and it was a very bad situation, and

8: otherwise, he wouldn't have been there and they hadn't clamped

9 down.

10 Mr. Hornbeck. What information did he relate to you that

11 involved Rolando Cubela?

12

Mr. Espinosa. He told me that he had seen Cubela in

13 Paris; that there was something going on but he didn't want to

14 tell me, and he wanted

somebody else to tell me the whole

15 thing.

16. Mr. Hornbeck. Is there some reason why he didn't want to

17 relate the

story to you?

18

Mir. Espinosa. Because he didn't know much about it but

19. he knew they had tried to get ahold of me but le said,

20 "Rolando is involved with the CIA and there is something

21 happening, and I think you should see Robreno. "

1 punk.

ir. Hornbeck, When you say "punk," do you mean he had

3 some criminal background?

4

Mr. Espinosa. I don't know, but he is a delinquent, let

5 us put it that way. I am not a full-time delinquent as he is.

6 He was involved with the student movement in Havana and he

7 knew Rolando very well.

8

Mr. Hornbeck. When you were describing him as a

9 delinquent, do you mean he would engage in crime or do

anything for money; or what is it?

11

Mr. Espinosa. He was a bad boy; and do you know what a

12 bad boy is? He was a bad boy. When he used to be a kid, if

13. there was a blind man crossing a street with a stick, he would

14 take the stick from the

blind man, is that right? That is the

15 kind of thing he would do when he was a kid and man, what he

16 grew up to be.

17

He was with Castro's government and he was at one point

18 the head of sone revolutionary tribunals and he carried. out a

19 lot of death sentences.

20

Mr. Hornbeck. What was he doing at the time that you

21 heard his name in 1965?

22

Mr. Espinosa. I don't know what he was doing in Madrid,

23 but I know that he had gotten into so many problens with the

24 government in Cuba that they just said, "Okay," and they put

25 him into prison for something, and I don't know exactly what

1 it was, and they said, "Okay, either you stay here forever. or.

2 you leave the country and we don't want you here anymore.

3

Mr. Hornbeck.

He was living in Madrid at the time you

4 were in Paris?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

And when Rolando started his thing

with the CIA, I guess he was talking to him, too.

7

Mr. Hornbeck. How

were you going to meet him? were you

going to do to Spain?

9

Mr. Espinosa. I

was going to go to Spain. At the time I

10

had one of his alien American

passports, since I never had my

11 own passport because the Spanish government, it would take

12 them a month --

13

Mr. Hornbeck.

So the CIA originally took your passport

14 from you?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

16

Mr. Hornbeck. Here you in touch with the cIa

at all when

17 you were in Paris?

18

Mr. Espinosa. No.

19

20

Mr. Hornbeck. All right. So you did not get to Spain?

Mr. Espinosa. I didn't get to Spain. And I called him

21 on the telephone and I said "I am sending you a ticket.

Come

22 over and see me in Paris." And he was the first one who told

23 me the story.

24

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you just relate to us, in summary,

25. what he told you about this particular involvement of Cubela?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

14 53080 DocId:32240213 Page 78

## Page 79

66

Mr. Espinosa. That Cubela had been talking to some CIA

2 people; that there was goind to be an uprising or a coup or

3 something down in Cuba led by Cubela and a few other people

4 who were in the

government at the time, or in the army, and

that for some reason Cubela didn't trust williamson in Spain.

6

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you identify who williamson was?

7

Mr. Espinosa. What I had been led to believe, williamson

8 was head of the CIA in Spain at the time.

9

Mr. Hornbeck. Was there

a reason given to you as to why

10: Cubela did not trust him?

11

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.. He said to me that he was living --

12 first he was an alcoholic and living with this Cuban: girl who

13. had taken information from him, taken files with her and went

14 back to Cuba.

*15

Mr. Hornbeck. This is information that you heard?

16

Mr. Espinosa. This is what they told me; why rolando

17 didn't want to speak to williamson any longer.

18

Mr. Hornbeck. You are getting this information fron

19 Cubela?

20

Mr. Espinosa. Yes. And how much truth is involved in

21. this I can't say. So that. Rolando didn't want to talk to him

22. anymore and that I should come over here as a good CIA man,

23

and I said "I am no longer with the CIA," and they said "we

24 want you to get in touch with them and tell them all of this."

25

Mr. Hornbeck. Now, had your original contact in Paris

mentioned to you he thought you were

in the CIA?

2

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

3

Mr. Hornbeck. Had he called you to come to Paris or you

4 just came to Paris independently?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Mo. It was somebody that if I ever went

6

to Paris I was

going to call.

7

Mr. Hornbeck. So Paris was entirely your idea?

8

Mr. Espinosa. Entirely a pleasure trip.

9

Mr. Hornbeck. Was there any particular reason why you

10 would spend your own personal money to have Cubela come to

11. Paris from Spain?

12

Mr. Espinosa. Yes. Still, you know, I think $150 or

sonething, for something as important as this, I could send my

14 friend and

my country, it wasn't going to make such a big hole

15. in iny pocket.

16

Mr. Hornbeck. Did Cubela say anything about any Soviets

17 in Cuba during this conversation?

18

Mir. Espinosa. lo. They didn't say anything about

19 Soviets in Cuba, but Blanco -- I cannot remember his first

20

name; we

used to call him the crazy Blanco -- I met him and

21 he was on his way to Cuba from Prague, Czechoslovakia,

and he

22 was on his way from Russia to Cuba via Czechoslovakia and

23 Paris and he was the one who mentioned about the Russian

24 technicians; to make sure and to make sure to tell the CIA

25 that if there was going to be any kind of doublecrossing of

this operation, they

were going to take care of these Russian

technicians who were

advisors, or whatever they were, who were

3

in their particular place.

4

Mr. Hornbeck.. All right. How did you know Blanco?

5

iir. Espinosa. I knew him from Cuba.

6

Mr. Hornbeck. And was it just coincidence that blanco

was coming through Paris at the same time that you were there?

8

Mr. Espinosa.. I don't know.

9

Mr. Hornbeck. How did he know how to contact you?

10

Mr. Espinosa. Because anybody who would come to Paris.

will always contact this guy Trasancos; at least this kind of

12 people because we all knew each other from Cuba.

13

Mr. Hornbeck. Had Blanco been with you and Cubela in

14 activities prior to 1959?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

16

Mr. Hornbeck. When Blanco gave you this particular

17 information about the soviet technicians, was there anyone

18 else present during the conversation?

19

Mir. Espinosa. No, it was only he and I.

• 20

Mr. Hornbeck. Were there any conversations between you,

21. Blanco and Robreno in Paris?

22

Mr. Espinosa. No.

23

Mr. Hornbeck. And no conversations between you, Blanco,

24

and Irasancos?

Mr. Espinosa.

No. But there were conversations between

Mr. Espinosa. The one I mentioned before, everything

4. that Cubela told me about the

CIA and Williamson in Spain he

5 said to me

in

front of Trasancos.

6

"r. Hornbeck.

Is your

testimony that there was then an

7 agreement between the three of you that cubela needed to

8 change his CIA contact?

9

Mr. Espinosa. I didn't agree to anything. All I said,

10 was they landed the story on me in

the middle of my Parisian

11 vacation, and

because it was Rolando and it was something that

12 I could have some importance or sense in the future, I came

•13 over here and I contacted them the best way I could.

14

fir. Hornbeck. In other words, you were going to be the

15 messenger for the contacts they felt that they didn't have?

16

17

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, more or less, that was the idea.

Mr. Hornbeck. And you then traveled from Paris to Mew

18 York?

19

Mr. Espinosa. That

is right.

20

Mir. Hornbeck. And who pays for your ticket?

21

Mr. Espinosa. If I go to Paris and I live in the States,

22 I have to have a round-trip ticket.

23 Mr. Hornbeck. What I am getting at, so you understand

24 the purpose of the deposition, we have to ask as much detail

25

as possible, and what I am really getting at is whether ör not

and then to come back to New York 15 days later, and this

4 happened

when I was there, and I

came back to new York on my

5 ticket originally purchased by me, and I was never refunded by

got to New York and I contacted Mr. Cavasantos.

Mr. Hornbeck.. He was an officer with the Immigration

9 Service?

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

11

Mr. Hornbeck. And you had some previous relationship; is

12 that true?

13

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you tell us briefly what that was?

15

Mr. Espinosa. He lifted two bans against traveling, and

16 all the things that I mentioned before.

17

Mr. Hornbeck. You first contacted him, and what did you

18

tell him?

19

Mr. Espinosa. I said, "I have to contact someone in the

20 CIA, and of course I have no idea how to contact anybody."

21

So he said, "Okay." He picked up the telephone and he

22 called somebody in the FBI office in New York and he sent me

Cavasantos before, and I said, "Look, I just came from Europe;

there is something happening and I would have to contact

13 someone in the CIA, and I used to work for them and I was

14 involved in the Bay of Pigs. Anything you want to check what

15 I am telling you, you can check with that."

16

ir. Hornbeck. Did you mention Cubela's name to either

17 Cavasantos or to the FBI?

18

Mr. Espinosa. Maybe; I can't say for sure, but maybe.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. Your best memory is that you did not

20 discuss much of the details?

21

Mr. Espinosa.

No.

22

Mr. Hornbeck. At some point were you put in contact with

23

the CIA?

24

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.

25

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you tell us where the meeting took.

place and how many people were present?

2

Mr. Espinosa. The meeting took place at the FBI office

in New York, and there was only one person present.

4

Mr. Hornbeck. This is someone from the Agency?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Again, I assume he was.

6

Mr. Hornbeck. Could you physically describe this

7

individual?

8

Mir. Espinosa. Yes. He was a man in the late forties or

9 early fifties, gray hair, and he must have been

blond, but

10 very heavy gray at the time, and blue eyes.

11

Mr. Hornbeck. Glasses?

12

Mr.

Espinosa. No glasses. Very well fit and very

13 handsome guy.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. Approximately how tall and how much did'he

15 weigh?

16

Mr. Espinosa. He was, I would say, about 5'10 or 5'11

17 170 pounds.

18

Mir. Hornbeck. During your conversation with this

19

individual, did you relate all of the details of the

20 information that you had learned in Paris?

21

Mr. Espinosa. I did.

22

r. Hornbeck. Did you include the portion told you by

23 Blanco about the alternative plan with the soviet technicians?

24

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

this particular individual?

2

Mr. Espinosa. He was a very cool, composed man, and he

3 said "I am going to washington and I will contact you

In the

next couple of days or three, maybe, and maybe we will go to

5 Spain together or somebody will go with you."

6

I was so upset about this that I

got a friend of mine in

7 New York, through Senator Javits, to get me a meeting in

8

washington here with some sub-secretary of foreign affairs in

9 charge of the cuban thing, and I never heard from this guy and

10 time was

going by, and I told this friend of mine and through

11 Javits he got me to come here and see this guy, and I came

12 here and I told him the whole story. And he said, "We will

13

get in touch with you. "

and they never did.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. Do you have any idea who it was that you

15 met with in washington?

16

Mr. Espinosa. No.

17

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you ever keep a diary or on a card?

18

Mr. Espinosa. I could

find out eventually if I wanted

19

to.

20

• Mr. Hornbeck. Do you think that you might be able to do

21 that?

22

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes. I would have to call this guy and

23

have him call Javits and trace the thing back to the time when

24 it happened, but I am sure it can be traced.

25

Mr. Hornbeck. Do you remember the building where you

to speak with this particular

3

Mr. Espinosa. Mo.

4

Mr. Hornbeck. Your best memory is that it was some

5 official in the State Department?

6

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, it was some official in the State

7 Departient; some kind of sub-secretary or something in charge

8. of Cuban affairs. But I was there and he didn't put me on to

9 some monkey room.

I know I saw somebody, the right person.

10

Mr. Hornbeck. I assume that you did.wait. the. two or

11 three

days in New York before you contacted your friend to

12 reach Senator Javits?

13

Mr. Espinosa. I waited longer than that. I

waited a

14 couple of weeks and nothing happened, and then I got in touch

15. with this guy because I knew he is very friendly with javits,.

and I said, "I know you have friends in washington, and all of

17 that, and there is something that I have to discuss."

18

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you ever think about contacting the

19 CIA directly through one ai your old contacts?

20

Mr. Espinosa. I never had any contacts.

What contacts?

21

They are guys living in Miami for two or three or four months,

22 and one day they disappear, and "Freddy Gomez," and you never.

23 see him again, and maybe he is sent to Guatemala or Central

24 Europe, or whatever, and then you see another guy and you

25 don't call them. They call you.

Mr. Hornbeck. was there any bad

feeling between you and

2 the Agency when

you terminated your relationship with them in

1961?

3

4

Mir. Espinosa.

I don't know. From my part it was a lot

5 of bad feeling.

6

Mr. Hornbeck. You felt you had not been treated fairly

7 by the Agency?

8

Mr. Espinosa. Not me. I felt a lot of people got killed

9 for nothing.

10

Mr. Hornbeck. All right. After you came to washington

"1 and discussed this particular situation, what was the next

12 thing that you did?

13

Mr. Espinosa. Let me make a parenthesis now.

This guy,

14 one of the reasons why I assumed he must have been from the

15 CIA, is when I touched the thing about George Robreno,

16 immediately he said to me, "El Maga," this is like

a' name that

17 only people that are close to him or that know

him very well

18 or from the Agency would know his name.

19

20

Mr. Hornbeck. Could you spell that?

Mr. Espinosa. M-a-g-a. It is magician in English.

And

21

he didn't have any accent when he said "El Maga."

22.

Mr. Hornbeck: You are discussing the conversation with

23 the fellow you

assumed

to be from the Agency in New York when

24 you first arrived?

25

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.. And he was saying to me, "How much

2 And he said, "Yes, I know how he is," but the guy knew the

3 background of him.

4

Mr. Mornbeck.: When you mentioned Blanco, did the

individual you assumed to have been from the Agency come up

6 with his nickname?

7

Mr. Espinosa.. No.

8

Mr. Hornbeck. Did he act as though he knew who you were

9 talking about?

10

Mr. Espinosa. No.

11

Mr. Hornbeck. Did he ask you for any identifying

• 12 information about Blanco?

13

Mr. Espinosa.

NO.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. During this time then that you were in

15 Washington in 1965, did you ever contact Mike NoLaney to see

16 if he could help in some fashion?

17 .

Mr. Espinosa. I would have contacted Mike McLaney to

18 help me in other things, but not to get me in contact with the

19 CIA.

20

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you contact Mike MoLaney for any

21 social or personal reasons?

-22

Mr. Espinosa. At that time, no. For sure, every time I

23 went to Miami, and all of the time I lived in the States,

•24 every time I went to Miami I contacted Mike; every time. But

25 I contacted him socially to have a drink or go whoring around.

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

11

Mr. Hornbeck. So you did not hear from the FBI?.

12

Mr. Espinosa. No.

13

Mr. Hornbeck. How long did you stay in New York, if you

14 can estimate?

15

Mr. Espinosa. I left lew York in 1967.

Mr. Hornbeck. So jou spent the next approximately two

17 and a half years in New York?

Mr. Espinosa. No. I would say the next two years in New

20. March or Arpil of 1967; so a little bit less than a year.

21

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you have any contact directly or

2

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.

Robreno wrote me a

letter one.time

3 asking me to put my name

to a document, and ne. wanted to get a

4. visa to come to the States and he wanted me to sponsor hin and

5 he needed two sponsors.

And he wrote me a letter

on a paper,

6 and I signed my name to the sponsorship, and that is the only

7 time.

8

ir. Hornbeck. Did he actually arrive, to your knowledge?

9

Mr. Espinosa. No, they never gave him a visa.

10

Mr. Hornbeck. Until the time that Cubela was arrested,

11 did you have any information about him personally or about the

12 particular plot person?

13

Mr. Espinosa. Nothing whatsoever. In my mind I thought,

14 well, probably he dot wise to the whole thing and just dropped

15 it, because sonie time elapsed between

the time

that I spoke to

16 his people in Paris and until the CIA

and the time he got

17 caught in Cuba.

18

Mr. Hornbeck. Was your first knowledge that he was

19 arrested from

some public source or from a parsonal source?

20

Mr. Espinosa. Public source.

21

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you tell what that was?

22

Mr.

Espinosa. It was a newspaper.

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you recognize the names of other

24 persons arrested with him?

was somebody else arrested.

And

the first thing I read about

2 it, there were four people arrested, and I knew Blanco and I

3 didn't know the others.

4

Mr. Hornbeck. I am sure then if you have the

public

accounts of that trial, you know that cubela was not executed,

and

did you

rind

that a strange event?

7

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes and no.

8

9

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you tell us why "yes" and "no"?

Mr. Espinosa. "Yes, " because, to my knowledge, Castro

10

had never commuted anybody's death sentence in Cuba yet, and

11 on the other hand, I knew he liked the guy very much.

12

Mr. Hornbeck. It was a

personal relationship.between

13 Cubela and Castro?

14

Mr. Espinosa. Yes. Whatever it was, love, hate, or the

15 faggots --I don't know what it was -- but they had a

16 relationship, an especial relationship between them.

17

Mir. Hornbeck. Can you give us any examples of a special

18 relationship between the two?

19

Mir. Espinosa. Well, I remember one time when Rolando

20 pulled a gun on Castro in

front of his bodyguards and

21 everything and called him every name in the book, and of

22 course nobody moved or said anything, but I thought when this

23

is over, he is going to go to the can forever, and

nothing

24 happened to him.

25

Mir. Hornbeck. I take it this is sometime still in 1959?

80

Mr. Espinosa. This was at that time, and he just put his

2 arm on him and he said "You have such a temper" and talked him

3 out of everything.

4

Mr. Hornbeck. Would you describe Cubela as an individual

5 having a very quick temper or very emotional person?.

6

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, extremely.

7

8

Mr. Hornbeck: Nould you describe him as unstable?

Mr. Espinosa: Yes.

9

Mr. Hornbeck. Have you directly or indirectly received

10 any information about Cubela since the time that he was sent

11 to prison in Cuba?

12

Mr. Espinosa.. No.

13

Mr. Hornbeck. Do you have any information whether or not

14 he is still alive or anything?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes. What I hear is that he is alive and

16 he is working

as a doctor and he is not having such a bad

17 life.

18

Mr. Hornbeck. How would you get this kind of

19

information?

20

Mr. Espinosa. Because I can't remember now, I think I

21 had this from Trasancos in Paris, but there is some kind of -

22 I don't know if he was a diplomat or if he is a French

2 as a doctor and the beginning was very tough, and then heis

3 working as a doctor and he is not having it so bad; but he is

4 alive and he is in prison.

5

Mr. Hornbeck. Were you told of the method by which

6 Cubela was supposed to assassinate Castro?

7

Mr. Espinosa. No. I heard the story about the rifle and

8 the telescopic site, and I had a story that he had met Artine,

9 which of course I thought was stupid of him, and I had a story

10: that Artime had promised him some boats through the cIA to get

11 him out.

12

I repeat to you today what I said the other day, the

13 whole thing doesn't make sense to me. And on one hand I hear

14 this, and of course it is very difficult to judge something

15 when you are being told by third parties, and on the one hand

16 I hear that there is

going to be an insurrection, let others

17 call it that way, or a military uprising of certain people in

18 the country, and on the other hand I hear that Cubela is going

19 to shoot the guy. And if you are going to shoot the guy and

20 there is going to be an insurrection, why do you need some

21 boats to take you out?

22

once you do that you have to stay in and see it through.

23 And you follow me, if there is going to be an insurrection and

24 you are going

to be a leader, how the hell are you going to

2

There are

a number of things that I tried to be very

3 logical about, and I try to be a very logical person all of

4 the time, but especially when they are logical, I try to be

5 more logical and I am objective about things. I don't

6. understand it.

7

Mr. Hornbeck.

When you heard these stories about Artime

8 being involved, or a rifle with a scope being involved, what

9 was the source of that information?

10

Mr. Espinosa. This I heard from Robreno.

: 11

Mr. Hornbeck. Was this during the same discussions

in

12 Paris before New York?

13 : Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. Did Rubreno know Artime, to your

15 knowledge?

16 Mir. Espinosa. I don't know. I think maybe he was with

.17 Rolando when he had the meeting with

Artime; maybe, but I

am

18 not sure. But I know they had never been friends before.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. Are you saying your information from

20: Rubreno was that Artime met in Madrid with Cubela?

21 Mr. Espinosa. I can't remember if it was Madrid, but

22 positively that he had met cubela.

23

Mr. Hornbeck, Nas your information that the CIA ad

24 arranged this meeting, or did you have any knowledge of the

25 CIA at that time?

1

Mr. Espinosa. No. He told me that he had been in touen

2 with the CIA and he had been in touch with Artime, but at the

3

moment I

was led to believe it was the CIA who had arranged

4 the meeting, and I would have been surprised if that was so:

5

Mr. Hornbeck. I want to be very specific as to the

6 information

that you

are getting from Rooreno and from any

7 other source.

8

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

9

Mr. Hornbeck. So just getting back to what he told you,

10 Robreno says to you, on the one hand Cubela has been in touch

11 with williamson from the CIA, and he also tells you Cubela has

12 met with Artime,

and you are not sure whether Rubreno tells

13 you that Cubela and Artime met in Madrid. Is that a correct

14 summary?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes. He told me that they met; but I

16 can't remember whether it was in Madrid or another place.

17

Mr. Hornbeck, Was there anything about the use of a

18 rifle and a silencer by Cubela that you would have found

19. strange in an assassination plot to kill Castro?

20

Mr. Espinosa. I would have found it very strange because

21 Castro is a touch guy and you can never hunt him with a rifle

22 in the sense you never know where he is going to be or which

23 street he is going to be passing through. So I would think it

24

is very, very uniakely, and especially Reiando knows this very

25 well, better than I do, that this is a kind of a

guy that

2

Mr. Hornbeck. would the special relationship you

3. discussed

vefore between Castro and Cubela have presented some

special opportunities for Cubela?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Incredibly special opportunities;

6 exceptionally special.

7

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you give us something on that?

8

Mr. Espinosa. Let us say one day Rolando could find out

9 that Castro was in his home outside Havana, and he could have

10 gone over there at a day or night, and even at 5:00 o'clock in

11 the morning and tell the guards "I am going to see Castro,"

12 and they would have let him in without objection.

13

Mr. Blackmer. You were friends with Carlos Hermanes?

14

15

Mr. Blackmer. You went on two raids with

him

them that were

16 aborted and you trained with him in Panama and Guatemala. Did

17 you recognize that he had a special relationship with Manuel

18 Artime?

Do you know the extent of that?

I was assigned

9 you want me to tell you the story about that?

10

Mr. Blackmer. I don't think that that will be necessary.

11

What was the feeling generally among the exiles that you

12 had contact with about Artime and his position with the CIA?

13

14

that?

15

Mr. Espinosa. They disliked the idea that a puppet was

dislike or distrust for Artime?

10

Mr. Espinosa. Because the person who was sponsoring it :

11

was Mike, and he gave us a means to do it and he didn't get

12 the right bombs and we didn't get the right things; he is not

an expert in explosives or in planes.

Mr. Blackmer. And you couldn't do any better than

2 it to me, and I säid, "Okay,. I will take it." And I had this

3 dog for many years, and that was the extent of my friendship

5 be a lawyer in cuba, a ton Santos Trafficante

6

Mr. Hornbeck. Is this just common knowledge, or did you

7. know this personally?

8

Mr. Espinosa. It was common knowledge. I think he is

9 doing some time in jail right now.

10

Mr. Hornbeck. He is doing time in Spain now?

11

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, for passing false dollars.

12

Mr. Hornbeck.. Counterfeit money?

13

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. When did you hear that information?

15

Mr. Espinosa.

Many years ago; five or six years ago, or

16 maybe more.

"17

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you tell us how you heard the

18

information and any details you may have heard?

19

Mr. Espinosa. I can't recall who told me the story. And

20 this was at the beginning when I went to Spain.

21

• Mr. Hornbeck. Which would have been approximately when?

22

Mr. Espinosa. That would be 1972.

23

Mr. Hornbeck. And you heard the story then?

24.

Mr. Espinosa. That Raphael had been there and that he

25. had ten or fifteen thousand dollars in one hundred dollar

notes and he

was passing them for two or three days and then

2 they got him and then he sot a bunch of years in jail.

3

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you hear whether. or not trafficante

4. had ever tried to help him in Spain?

5

Mr. Espinosa. No, but I heard that he had something to

6 do with. Irafficante.

7

Mr. Hornbeck. That the counterfeiting had

something to

8 do with Trafficante?

9

Mr. Espinosa. This is what I heard, but you know how

10 people talk to me. It is not very. difficult to figure out if

11 Raphael was Trafficante's lawyer in Cuba; now he gets caught

12 in Spain with counterfeit money. There is a likely

13

possibility of the money came from the guy and this is what

14

people are speculating about, or told me at the time.

•15

Mr. Hornbeck. When Trafficante was in Cuba, he was

16 arrested sometime in mid-1959, and did you ever hear

that?

17

Mr. Espinosa. No.

18

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you ever hear that Mike MoLäney was

19 arrested in Cuba?

• 20

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

21

Mr. Hornbeck.

can you tell us what you heard and from

22 What source?

23

Mr. Espinosa.

All I know is that he was living in the

24 country and he was going back to Miami and he was living and

25 they took him and they put him in jail for two or three days.
