It is noted that CIA requested the State Depart-

ment not to disseminate the above information outside of

their office, without prior approval from CIA; therefore,

this information is being placed in the Administrative

Section of this report, inasmuch as the information can

not be disseminated.

It is noted that on June 2, 1961, MM 726-S

informed that subject, in addition to stating that he had

transmitted messages on behalf of the FRD, had said that

everything he sent went to CIA before being transmitted,

and that all information which came back from Cuba went

to the FRD and also to CIA.

Subject told informant that

if he goes to trial, he will implicate CIA as being behind

his radio operation.

This information has been furnished to Mr. RAY

DUBOIS, CIA, Miami. [DUBOIS said he had received similar

reports, and that for that reason, his headquarters, on

May 12, 1961, requested that efforts be made to have the

charges dropped at Miami against subject.

ropped auested that

DUBOIS said

such action was requested, inasmuch as the general feeling

was that if subject were prosecuted, it could result in

embarrassment to CIA. l u

On May 3, 1961, ROBERT W. RUST, Assistant United

States Attorney, Miami, Florida, who is handling the pro-

secution of subject, directed a letter to HAROLD SHAPIRO,

Chief, Administrative Regulations Section, Criminal

Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D. C., en-

closing copies of the complaint filed against the subject.

RUST said in his letter that he was not proceeding further

with the prosecution, until such time as he received

instructions from the interested agencies, or Mr. SHAPIRO's

office.

RUST added that his office had not been advised

as yet as to the results of the cryptographic analysis

of the seized code books and coded messages, and that he

had received no information whatsoever concerning this

matter.
