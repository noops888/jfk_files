was blinded when acid was thrownin his face, presumably

by the deceased, ABRAHAM TELVI. The subject, CARLINO,

along with others, was

held as a material witness in this

matter. Also involved in this case was JOHN DIOGUARDI.

This matter was never brought to trial due to a change

• 1n

the testimony of the major witnesses in this case.

It is to be noted that several individuals,

whose rellability is not known, have stated in the past,

that the subject, CARLINO, IS a

a "button man", however, none

have advised to what "family" subject belongs. Because

of subject's close association with some of the members of

the THOMAS LUCHESE "family", the subject : 1s for the present,

being carried with that group.
