THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

Mr. John R. Tunheim

Chair, Assassination Records

Review Board

Re: JFK. Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992

Dear Mr. Tunheim:

This will respond to your 14 September 1998

letter regarding

Central Intelligence Agency compliance with the "JEK Act."

I have no doubt whatsoever that the CIA has fully met its

obligations

to locate, review, and release

"assassination

records" as defined in the JFK Act.

The Agency's 2 September

1998 Declaration of Compliance-signed, as you note, by CIA's

Director of

Information Management, Edmund Cohen-confirms my

judgment.

I have full

confidence in the scope of the Agency's

searches as described in Mr. Cohen's recent declaration.

As Director of

Information Management, Mr. Cohen is directly

responsible for CIA's records systems and for ensuring the

adequacy of CIA's search, review, and release of documents under

the JFK Act.

Mr. Cohen signed the Agency's Declaration of

Compliance because he was the most senior Agency official with

direct personal knowledge that its statements were accurate and

complete.

There was no more appropriate signatpry.

In sum, I understand that the appropriate CIA staff officers

have worked diligently to locate and disclose to the JFK Boaro

all relevant records in the Agency's possession and that they do

not believe any other relevant records are being withheld from

the Board. Mr. Cohen's declaration confirms my understanding.

I trust that this will meet your requirements.

Sincerely,

Cat

George J. Tenet
