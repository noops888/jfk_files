CUBA'S REACTION- TO KENNEDY'S MURDER

For the Chief of Mission.

On 24 November

reported from Havana:

l. All information connected with the assassination is being studied

in detail by the local leadership. They believe the present situation to be

very serious.

Their presumption was confirmed by the direction taken by the

search for KENNEDY's murderers, that is among Castroites, Communists and USSR

influence. They are concerned with the anti-Cuban and anti-Soviet past which

will exert a substantial influence on the foreign and domestic policy of the

USA• This will be possible because there is a lack of a head of government

with the authority and modernistic leanings which KENNEDY represented.

Ultrareactionary circles in the USA, the Pentagon and the (B val C)

IA considered KENNEDY's policy too weak and conciliatory and its continuation

as dangerous to them. It is believed here that the assassination may be

connected with the partially controversial position of KENNEDY and that it

actually could have been planned or committed by these circles. The fact of

the assassination was immediately used by them to increase positive influences

on the Department of State and to turn world opinion away from the real

culprits and intention.

3o Thé assassination is being used to strengthen conservative circles

throughout Latin America. They fear that an adventurous decision will be

made with regards to Venezuela.

4o Immediately after the first information was received on 22 November,

a quiet military alert was declared in Cuba. They will begin the legal draft

of recruits on 25 November.

Military units are being relocated.

5. FIDEL's speech (see the plainlanguage message of 24 November) was

received with gravity and it was in accord with the political thought of the

more mature circles.

An immediate political evaluation of the existing and

growing situation

especially around Cuba was needed.
