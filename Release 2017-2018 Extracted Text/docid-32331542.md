Reference Bureau letter, 9/9/66.

Referenced letter requested WrO to determine whether

the individual employed by the telephone company who

furnished information to SA WILLIAM D. CAMPBELL COn-

cerning the telephones of CHARLES WHITE, had knowledge

of or was in any other way aware of the cooperative ser-

vices rendered by the telephone company to the Bureau,

particularly with regard to security matters.

The individual who furnished such information is WE 1401-S

(J. FORD KELLEY, Division Commercial Manager):

He does

not have knowledge of telephone services furnished to

WFO at the field office with regard to security matters.

However, WF 1401-S does make arrangements for telephone

services

vestigations conducted

in the security field.

A high-level official of the telephone company has

expressed the opinion that if an official, of the company

were subpoenaed to testify concerning. intormation which

was supplied to WTO in confidence, it would have an

adverse effect on the cooperation which the telephone

company renders to this office.: In' view of this fact,

WFO feels that every effort should be made to obviate

the

necessity of having a telephone company official

testify in this matter.
