1978 VISIT OF PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER. ALTHOUGH THERE IS

SECRET

A TENDENCY TO BLAME IHE UNITED STATES FOR VENEZUELA'S CURRENT

FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, IT IS DOUBIFUL THAT DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH

MIGHT TAKE PLACE WOULD BE AIMED AT PRESIDENI CARTER, BUT

RATHER THEY WOULD BE STAGED DURING THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT

TO EITHER EMBARRASS THE CURRENT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OR TO

FURTHER DRAMATIZE THE CAUSE BEING ADVOCATED.

3• THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES RECOGNIZE THIS

SITUATION AND EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE UNPLEASANT, ANTI-

VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT INCIDENTS DURING PRESIDENT CARTER'S

CARACAS VISIT. VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THESE INCIDENTS

WILL DEAL WITH CHARGES OF HUMAN RIGHIS VIOLATIONS AND GOVERNMENT

CORRUPTION. THE SECURITY FORCES WILL BE

ABLE TO CONTROL ANY

SITUATION THAT ARISES, THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE.

KNOWN AS THE ANTONIO JOSE DE SCURE GUERRILLA FRONT: THE

ARMED FORCES OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (FALN), AND THE ORGANIZATION

OF REVOLUTIONARIES (OR). THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN

THE EASTERN VENEZUELAN STATES, PARTICULARLY MONAGAS, ANZOATEGUI,

SUCRE AND BOLIVAR. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT NUMEROUS

RAIDS ON MILITARY POSTS, HAVE TAKEN OVER SMALL TOWNS FOR A LIMITED

PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THEY LECTURED THE TOWNS PEOPLE ON

ANTI-GOVERNMENT POLITICAL THEMES, AND IN GENERAL HAVE HARRASSED

AND EMBARRASSED THE GOVERNMENT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.

THE AREA, OR THROUGH THE YEARS HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME

SECURITY AND MILITARY PEOPLE. ESTIMATES OF THEIR STRENGTH

WITH THE LOCAL POPULATION, HAVE, IN TURN, HARMED THE GOVERN-

MENT'S IMAGE IN THE AREA FAR MORE IHAN THE GUERRILLAS COULD

HAVE HOPED TO DO WITH THEIR OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT

PUBLICLY CLAIMS TO HAVE CAPTURED SEVERAL GUERRILLA LEADERS

RECENTLY, THE PRISONERS ARE ILLITERATE FARM WORKERS WHO CLEARLY

ARE NOT TRAINED GUERRILLA FIGHTERS. THOSE WHO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE

BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THE SECURITY FORCES, TURN AWAY FROM THE

HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BY PERSONAL RIVALRIES AMONG THEIR TOP

OFFICIALS. PART OF DISIP'S DIFFICULTIES ARISE FROM CHARGES

OF MISCONDUCT IN THE HANDLING OF THE ANTI-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN

IN THE EASTERN STATES. ANOTHER PART STEMS FROM MUTUAL DISTRUST

NORMAL CONDITIONS IS NONE TOO GOOD, IS NOI UP TO ITS USUAL
