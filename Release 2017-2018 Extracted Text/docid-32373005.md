Q:

A:

What was the line of reporting in ciA during the period I served

as working level point-of-contact with the Warren Commission Staff?

It was a multiple leveled things

(a) from the Commission and AWD

personally via McCone do Dick Helms, (b) from Helms to the two or

three

components primarily concermed fSE, then SB, Dave Murphy;

LA, then WH; and tols in practice, the substantive SB input worke

up by one of its

example each oments need den dee or sk

Cl had own defector input.

In addition, on sensitive natters of concern to the investluation

Dick Helms and Murphy also dealt directly with the Commission.

PRailles?

Did you hear:

?? [two crypts, one sounded by "Jackenet" ?].-

Можно!?

I had not..

Belin recalled that Castro had made a speech in which

9/4/75?

he had charged assassination intent by emigres and had promised

retribution in kind if there was official support.

Had any thought been given to the assumption that an anti-Castro

assassination plot might have been underway, and fact it was known

to Helms and to Castro? [Mr. Belin said he now knew that Helms

was, in fact, aware of something underway regarding castro. He

had

no evidence to show that I fRGRE had been informed about it.]

Would that change any of the thinking be Oswald's Mexican trip and

contacts?

Yes,

I said, though I intended to

moke potential importance

to Oswald's KGB. contacts, and related that and others--though

recognizing the wisdom of the Warren Commission's handling--hac

felt there had been narest theriowet aspect that should have

been pursued:

a.

Fact that his two Sovtet consular contacts in Mexico City

had been identified as KGB and at least one (both ?) had been

traced organizat tonat

To the Isth Lepartment (assassinations).

Q:

Why did Oswald's lies include a denial to Dallas police that he ha

about it?

All his other lies concerned key factual elements of his

Why also did Marina deny she knew anything about the

Mexican trip in her first story to the FBle-which she later rectified

before the Warren Conmission? Mr. Belim noted that he had left the

hypothesis

of Castro/Cuban. involvement oper in his book.

He added

that it would have been important to have known the facts about the

anti-Castro plot at the wmeof the warren Commission investigation

le felt the least he wowed haverdoneswould have been to nave insiste

on the polygraphing

of Mabina dgwad regarding her knowledge of

Oswald's Mexican trip.

has produced infor nation of taterest to the President's

Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. CI

Staff learned of AMMUGN da'30 April, A questionnaire was

submitted by the Staff on I May (Attachmemt A). Mr. Swenson,

who is handling the AMMUG/1 debriefing, provided a reply on

5 May (Attachment B). It was clear from Mr. Swenson's

sammary that AMMUG/l had information bearing on the

OSWALD relationship with the Cuban Embassy and Cuban

intelligence personnel in Mexico City, albiet his knowledge

was not that of a direct participant in matters affecting

OSWALD.

A follow-up questionnaire was submitted to

AMMUG/1 on 6 May (Attachment C). Mi. Swenson's reply

was dated 8 May (Attachment D). Attention is directed

particularly to the costent of paragraph two of Attachment D.

3. We bave the problem of reconciling the operational

exploitation of AMMUG/ 1 and satislying the responsibilities

we have undertaken with Mi. Rankin, ÄMMUG/1 is such an

operational gold mine that Mt. Swenson wants, at a maximum,

two months to work fully. It is palpable, however, that we

1. Reference is made to a telephone conversation yesterday

with Chief, CI Staff concerning this matter.

2. Because I am not aware of the information already

available to the Commission investigating the Oswald Case or

furnished by the agency, my debriefing of the source has been

based on the questions prepared by the CI Staff and on what the

Source answers have suggested. I shall be glad to pursue any

not performed any services. Her home is in the Vedado section

where the rents are high.

b. Source has known CALDERON for several years.

Before going to Mexico, she worked in the Ministry of Exterior

Commerce in the department which was known as the tEmpresa

Transimport". Her title was Secretary General of the Communist

Youth in the department named in the previous sentence.

Luisa CALDERON

transferred directly from her

position in the Ministry o1 Exterior Commerce to a post in Mexico,

a matter of surprize to the source.

Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez (DGI pseudo MORCOS),

shortly before he left Cuba for Mexico on or about 16 April 1964,

saw CALDERON.

REFERENCE

A.

Blind.Memorandum dated 05 May 1964 v

B. Blind Memorandum dated 07 May 1964

C. Conversations between CI Staff and

C/WH/SA/CI

1. When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the

specific questions prepared by C1 Staff were posed. The answers

given by the Source were reported in Reference A.

That memorandum

which I dictated to a CI Staff stenographer appears accurate except for

sentence #9 which should have said that the only possible "fabrication"

known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, on a

television program; of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald.

2. On 07 and 08 May 1984 I further discussed the Oswald Case

with the Sourca in order to clarify exactly what he knew and what

he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I belleve

that a clearer understanding of what he knows can be reached i I

record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.

Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the

Information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and

comments.

" I bave no personal knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD or his

activities and I do not know that OSWALD was an agent of the

Direccion General de Intellgercia (DCI) or any other directorate

or department of the Cuban Government.

I first heard of OSWALD aiter the assassination of President

Kennedy when nows media carried the name of OSWALD.

Personnel in the DCl first commented about the case, so far as

I can recall, one day atter lunch when a group of officers, of

whom I was one, were chatting.

The officers present were about

ten including Roberto SANTIESTEBAN, Norberto HERNANDEZ

de Curbelo, Andres ARMONA, Pedro FARINAS Diaz and

Manuel VEGA Perez.

Manuel VEGA Perez previously bad

been assigned to Mexico in the Cuban Consulate where he

was the principal intelligence afticer of the DG.

VEGA

mentioned that OSWALD had gone to the Cuban Consulate

wo or three timessin connection with a visa applicatio

uring the timethat VEGAjw as in Mexico. I gatere

although I do not know that VEGA made any specific

statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen

OSWALD. I well could have reached this conclusion

because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for

the DGI, Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons

applying for a visa to go to Cuba.

This is because DO

officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas

of agents of the bei. Such agentsion appearing at the

Consulate use a special phrase to indicate their relationship

with the DGI. (I do not know the particular phrase used

in every case.. I do know that agenta from El Salvador in

requesting visas always made mention of the name "Vauricio")

The DGI officers ata Consulate Interview visa applicants to

find out if they are agents. I the visa applicant does not use

one of the indies

ea phrases, the Del oficers, instead of

granting the vise immeciately, tell the applicant to return in

a few days.

The ofticer then notifies Habana and requests

authority for the visa,

I cannot recall i1 VEGA even made the

statement that he bad requested permission to issue a visa to

OSWALD, but I feel sure that he would have done so because

VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and

this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogelio RODRIG

seen OSWALD because he worker

Z Lopez also would have

with VEGA and also would

have screened visa applicants.

I thought that Luisa CASDERON might have had contact with

OSWALD because I learned about. I March 1964, shortly before

I made a trip to Mexico that sbechad been involved with an

American in Mexicg. The infarration to which I refer was told

to me by a DCI case

oficer named Norberto HERNANDEZ de

WHY

because he gave me $40

uy some shoes and

other items during my trip to Mexico.) I had

commented to HERNANDEZ that it seemed strange

that Luisa CALDERON was recetting a salary rom

the DGl although she apparently did not do any work

for the Service, CHERNANDEZ told me that bers was

a peculiar case and that hes himself believed that she

had been recrulted in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel PINEIRO, the Head of the DGI,

did not agree. As recall, HERNANDEZ had investigated

Luisa CALDERON. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted a letter to

her by an American who signed his name as OWER (phonetic)

or something similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difticult iu Spanish so I am not

sure of how the name mentioned by HERNANDEZ should be

spelled. It could have been "Howard" or something different.

As I understood the matter, the letter from the American

was a love letter but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and Luisa

CALDERON. Mats@undenstood from HERNANDEZ that

after the interception of thevletter she had been followed

and seen in the companiar an American. I do not know if

this could have been OSWALD. I, myself, considered the

case of Luisa CALDERON unusual because I had known her

before she went to Mexico when she worked in the Ministry

of Exterior Commerce in the Empresa Transimport Department

where she was Secretary General of Communist Youth.

She

was transferred directly from that position to a post in Mexico

which seemed strange.

The only other person about whom you asked me in connection

with this, whom I recall, is Sylvia DURAN and I know very

little about her.

What happened was that I was in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico on 23 March 1964 about 1230 in the afternoor

preparing to return to Habana the same)day.

I was talidng to

some other Cubans including Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez and

fnu BUENAVENTURA af the Cuban ambassy; a courier named

"Enio", a courter named, "Tato" yand one other Cuban whom I

cannot recall.

We saw a pretty girl standing at the end of

the reception room and someone asked who she was, and one

of the group said it was

I recall that, after the news of the assassination of

President Kennedy reached the DEl orders were issued

for all offigs of the OCt, at Headquarfers and in the field,

to sort and package all'documents according to whether

The material, once packaged,

was to be held pending turther instructions. All travel by

DEl officers and all DCI pouches were suspended temporarily.

In addition, I recall that DCI Headquarters personnel were

instructed either to remain in the DGI Headquarters offices

or to keep the DGI aware of their whereabouts so that they

could be reached immediately. I do not inow the reason for

these measures but I believe it logical that they were issued

because of the possibility that the United State might take

some type of action against Cuba and the DGI offices. As

nearly as I can recall, we were able to unpackage DGI fles

and use them normally about the 3rd December December v

3. In brief, the Source does not claim to have any significant

information concerning the assassination of President Kennedy or

about the activities of OSWALD I the paraphrased comments of

the Source are considered to net further clarification, I suggest that

Mr. Rocca, who is most fartlier with the details of the OSWALD

Case, talk to the Source & This can bearranged at any time. Mean-

while, I shall have a questian askedin a forthcoming LCFLUTTER to

determine whether or not the source seems to have concealed any

information on this matter.

Specific:

OSWALD

SEase

The source does not have aege knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD

or his activities but was able to provide items of interest based on

Cuban intelligence officers assigned to the Direccion General De

Inteligencia.

The information appearing below was furnished by

the source and is keyed to questions submitted.

1. Prior to October 1963, OSWALD) visited the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico City on two or three, gecasions. Before, during and after

these visits, OSWALD was incontact with the Direccion General De

Inteligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa CALDERON, Manuel

VEGA Perez and Rogelo RODRIGUEZ Dopez.

VEGA wha

a Cuban intelligence pseudonym is MARCOS

is the current Cuban 1S chee Mexico. He recently has had a

tour of duty in Habana, prigr to which he held the same post as

now as Cuban IS chief in Mexico.

RODRIGUEZ is a Cuban IS staff officer in Mexico. He has

three Cuban intelligence pseudonyms, Eduardo, Casimiro and Jose

Antonio.

The precise relationship of Luisa CALDERON to the DGI is

not clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from which she

returned to Cuba early in 1964.

The source does not know whether or not the Cuban Services

used OSWALD in any agent capacity of other manner.

3.

A.

When news of the assassination of President Kennedy

reached the DGI, it caused much comment concerning the fact

OSWALD had been in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. In addition,

orders were issued for all headquarters and field officers of the

DGI to sort and package all documents according to whether they

B. When the news that OSWALD was the assassin reached

the DGI, there was no immediate comment but, when Fidel CASTRO

spoke on television to deny Cuban involvement, there was considerable

comment concerning OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

At this time VEGA, who has been mentioned previously, was in Cuba

and commented to a group of DGI staff officers that OSWALD had come

to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to request a visa but had been refused.

VEGA did not give any details and the subject was not pursued.

4. It is not known whether information on OSWALD's visit to

the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September 1963 was relayed to any

Cuban service.

5. It is not known if the Cuban intelligence services had contact

with the New Orleans' Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

6. The only Molina whors recalled is "The Hook", the Cuban who

was convicted in New York City for the murder of a young girl during

a clash between two Cuban groups. The DGI staff officer who had been

in the United Nations in New York, SANTIESTABAN traveled to Cuba

with "The Hook" and with another Cuban named ORIHUELA and upon

arrival in Cuba tried to obtain employment for both individuals. The

names Pedro Charles and Peter have no known significänce.

7. The reaction of Soviet officials in contact with the Cuban intelli-

gence services is not known.

8. Nothing is known about Soviet proposals following the news of

President Kennedy's assassination.

9. The only fabrication known is the special matter by Fidel

CASTRO previously mentioned.

10. Nothing is known about Jack RUBENSTEIN akä Jack RUBY.

11. The name Gilberto LOPEZ is not familiar but, if he visited

DGI headquarters, a photograph of him possibly could be identified.

1. Did anyone with the CIA tell any member of the Warren

Commission or any lawyer serving on the Warren Conmission

staff that such plans had been underway?

yes, we would like to know what person or persons with the

Agency delivered said information,

when it was delivered, what specifically was told or said,

what documents there are to support the answers to the

going questions, and what response, if any'-was received from

the Warren Commission.! If the Commission was not told about

his, why was it not told and who made the decision not to

deliver such information to the Warren Commission?

2.

There is evidence that

Castro, prior to November 22, 1963,

knew about the existence of such

plans and the possible

olvement of the U.S. Government. Did the CIA at any time pIzo.

o the completion of the Warren Commission investigation have

any documents or other information

indicating that Castro may

have knayn about, such plans?

the answer is yes, would you

please furhishjuwith copies of all such documents and details

of any such information.

Jould you please advise us if there is any

Would you also

ments of any Cuban leader prior to November 22, 1963 indicating

Cuban leaders.

Would you please advise us if there is any information in

1963 any foreign government or any foreign group was consider-

ing a possible assassination.of any American leader. If so,

would you please advise us of all details and also advise us

who in the United States Government outside the CIA was ad-

MEMORANDUMITOR: ME. Rocca

Internet Mame Royarding

Agancy's Pestion in Dealing

with

Commission

The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the

Directo» has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,

Thursday.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a short but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues of

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities: that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

AMMUG/1

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

-sensitive WH source.

I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the basis for detailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

review this carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing.

3.

Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

This brief is concerned with five topics whick, it is

anticipated, will arise,

in the course of the Director's appear

ance before the Pregident'

Commission. These are:

a. Formal and

raqualified negation by the DCI

of any contact or association, direct or indirect,

between the Central Intelligence Agency and Lee

Harvey Oswald. This should be accompanied by

the tabling of an affidavit signed by the Director

and notarized. (TAB A)

b. A formal assurance by the Directer that all

information in the possession of the Agency regarding

Oswald's activittes and associations outside of the

United States has been made available to the

Commission through its staff, with which there has

been close and frequent contacts since the inception

of the Commission's activities. (TAB B)

activity. It is suggested phat the

DCI take the position

that at this time there is no conclusive evidence of

conspirataniel aponsorship of Oswald; that all Agency

information bearing on this problem has been furnished

to the Commission for evaluation and consideration in the

framework of its total knowledge of the facts. The Agency,

at the present time, is lacking any knowledge of recent

information of documentation furnished by the Soviet

Government to the Commission witk respect to Oswald's

activity in the Soviet Union. (TAB C)

d. The DCI's suggestions for improving policy and

organization with respect to the personal security of

the President, Certain steps relating strictly to the

Agency's jurisdiction have already been suggested by

memorandum. It is proposed that the Director now

make specific suggestions involving legislation which

would treat information bearing on the personal security

of the President and, advisedly, other Federal officials

directly related to national security affairs in a manner

similar to what currently exists by statute for special

U.S. Government agent, In many instances, CIA has been

named as his sponsor. The authorship, geographical dispersion

throughout the world, the identitycof themes and the timing lend

strong support to the conclusion that these charges are elements

of a world-wide, Sortet-sponsored propaganda and misinformation

program.

As DCI, MI. McCare welcomes this appearance before

the Commission to make a categorical and unqualified denial of

these unprincipled distortions of the historical and personal

responsibilities for what was a dastardly and heinous act. In

witness of this, the DCI submits to the Commission an affidavit

which formalizes this statement. The affidavit is attached.

Suggestions for Improving Policy and Organization Regarding

Presidential Security

Mr. Rankin raised than guestion dire ctly by letter.

In

its response, the Agency confined itself to elements relating

to its statutory mission. Specifically, it was suggested that:

a. The Secret Service, of Treasuty, record

with the Office of Central Referênce a formal require-

ment for information elating to Preidential security.

b. It was suggested that, if the Secret Service

jatended to expand its ireligence coverage of possible.

threats to the President's security, our experience

showed that it would need a specialized organizational

component to handle that task within the Secret Service

itself.

c.

The CIA reply also noted that the Agency was

in direct touch with the Secret Service regarding the

possible utilization by that agency of our experience in

machine data processing.

On the public record, it is

suggested that the DCI not repeat this detail.

The Commission's major problem has been the assessment

of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to

possible conspiratorial guidance. Because conspiracy is the

core of the problera, the DCI should point out the possibility of

legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing

recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating. There

is an analogy at close hand between the problem of developing in

advance information relating to Presidential security and the

problera faced by the county a low years ago regarding the

clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U.S. of special

nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that

time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955

(29 Stat 365, PL,165, 84th Congress). In essence, the Act estab-

lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

the Act provided by any person, and in certain instances privileged

treatment for such persons -- for example, asylum if they were

crated to mine the purposa at sia det.

1) Tha Dei should desperhat she Commiasion consider a

recommendation for original legislative action designed to

induce individuals to furnish information bearing on Presidential

security by offering a substantial reward and preferential treatment.

The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

which would attend the implementing legislation in this matter

could represent a

significant inducement even to staff officers

and personnel of seciet associations and state security organs

abroad whose functions include assassination and sabotage. It

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action.

The reward would constitute additional inducement for such

individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

The suggestion does not rest

on the caterial elements of

reward and special treatment. The DCI can assure the Com-

mission that we are aware that personnel in police state apparatuses

charged with the assassination and sabotage functions have repeatedly

expressed and, in many cases, acted upon their repugnance for

or the inducement which the DCI is here proposing.

In making this suggestion, the DCI may go one step further

in advising the Commission to suggest that the Commission

examine the advisability of legislation making it a Federal offense

to conspire and to kill the Chief Executive. 3) The DCI could also

indicate that the Commission might desire to suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

spiracy to kill any Federal official in the President's personal

circle of official associates directly concerned with national

security affairs. (The Agency's Legal Counsel states that

draft bills have been considered on the Hill.).

BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963;

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER

covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraorainar

ovocative fasbion

(" ... KENNEDY is acretini

the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic

American President of

all time...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United

States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the midale of September 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning papere the Times-Picayune,

on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-colmn head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba.

Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP). - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba.

..: World affairs... seemed to be

entering a more peaceful climate a few days

attacks.

"'The U.S. is always ready to negotiate

and make promises which later it will not honor.

This has happened to promises made during the

October crisis. They have been broken as can

be seen with new attacks.

"'But I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...'"

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance.

The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

Headquarters attention to the AP stary very shortly after

the dallas killing.

More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff Itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's

request, is to reconsider lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption

that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

of hindsight, may be stipulated in summary:

There is no increment of credible

evidence, applying this phrase

strictly, of

Soviet andYor Cuban political, intelligence

or security service involvement in

such evidence could exist in Moscow and/or

Havana, whose voluntary inputs to the warren

Commission were minimal in quantity and

quality, designed to cover up any admissions

of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD

which might be related directly or indirectly

with the assassination.

Therefore, the belief

that there was Soviet and/or Cuban (XCB and/or

warning and threat, given to AP corres-

there was any formal mandate, or even

The warren Commission Report takes note of this:

Caban diplomatic officials in

this country, which DELGADO at first took

to be 'one of his lies, but later

believed. * "2

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected. by the

language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,

the record of the beginning of OSWAID's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a question marka

11. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban

relations after CASTRO's takeover. OSWALD, and DELGADO at

the outset, were CASTRO supporters, OSWALD being particu-

larly keen about how to get to the island.

DELGADO'S testimony has the cast of credibility

Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention

on the male visitor who contacted OSWALD at El Toro Camp

and talked with him for between one and a half to two hours.

The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually

there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else

we know about OSWALD's activity in the United States before

or after his return to the United States. The record reflects

no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presump-

tion is that he was from the Cuban Consulate in Los Angeles.

Assuming that, the questions are: Who was it, and was

there reporting from los

geles to Washington and Havana

that could, in effect

represent the opening of a Cuban

file on OSWARD?

A sensitive liaison source, reporting after the

Ricardo L. SANTOS Pesa, discussed the recent refugee raids

on Cuba and their implications with a host-country aiplomat,

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-

22. The tenuous, enigmatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

a: "buisa' was probably identical with

LUISE CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban

Directórate canéral of Intelligence (DGI).

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headquarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

•as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963). The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'S SUCCESSOI)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

The "silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWAlD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

record regarding OSWALD's activity in

Mexico City. Her testimony, however, in its

entirety was taken and presented, solely, by the

Mexican Governmental authorities. A direct

He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally

Although Mr. Angleton thought that the lotter should

Mr. Dulles felt It should go son, be phrased ln genarall-

Sr. Dullas asted CIA only for the questions

and not for a draft letter.

thinking about thesa proposals.

(Note:

I instructed ir. Migren to prepare a

drait of suggested queries, using the

assistance of DERYABIN and

to haye this

ready, 1f possible, by the closa of

businegg today.

Rankin stated that the Commission wants to account

in dotall, mtnute by minute and hour by hour, for Oswald's

tine outside the United States.

lir. Bagley suggested that.

the narrative chronology of Oswald's stay in the Soviat Union

be convarted to a chronology tabulation which would pernit us

nore simpleto insert added details and dates as we learned

of thenjia

other documentation which we can expect to receive

shortly.

This vas agreed.

(Note:

I instructed Mr. Wigren to begin ro

casting the narrative Innediately into:

this {oru.)

Dr. Rankin said that the Comission has a waist-high

stack of documents and reports received fron the FBI and Secret

Service shich ClA has not jet received.

These Include Secret

Service Intervley with Marina Oswald,

letters Iron vee Oswald

In the USSB and other naterial. de promised to send this

material to Mr. Helms shortly..

(Boto:

We will pass appropriate parts of this

material to DERYABIll for lurther analy-

sis along the llnes of his earlier work

on documents already in our possession.

5.. Messrs. Anglaton, Murphy and Bocca considered DEBYA-

BIN's, initial analysts of Marina Oswald's documents, and the

questians to which it gave rise,

to be a worthritie sad

important sontrabution.

CIA would be unable to naka any Beri-

analysisjor even hygothesis until some of Dasiabit's

nestions had been answered.

Mr. Rocca suggested that DERYA-

BIN's paper be recast into nore of a questionnaire form and

ir. Bagley agreed,

pointing out that DERYABIN's coment and

speculation could be put off to the side as explanatory con

ment on ezch question, as appropilate.

Mr. Angleton and yr.

Murphy thought that it would be

desirable to send this paper

to the Harren Commission In advance of other CIA reports with

a nenorandun inforning the Connission that we would need

answers to this interim questionnaire in order to reconstruct

a detailed chronology of Oswald's time in the USSR and to

corment on his activity there.

The Connission would be asked

to procure the information fron Marina through any Agency 1t

_might choose.

Hr. Angleton reported that he had asked the Cormis-

sion representatives certain questions pertaining to our use

of defectors in analysing the Oswald papers:

Has the Connission formally requesting us to

bave

defectors analyse the material?

wellins thought that the answer

to this question is yes.

However,

Mr. Angleton asked for a formal

request fron the Comission to this

effect. The FBI has stated that lis

reports are not to ba passed to

ASLADLE, which nay cause some compli

cations.

D.

Would the Commission be prepared to assure the

urden of responsibility 1i sucha getector should disa.

gree with the Comission's opinions of coneyup with :

radically different hypothesis of interpretation?

The persons present said that the

Commission would.

If a defector who had contributod to tho analy-

sis of the docunents should be unwilling to appear person-

ally and formally before the Commission, would the

the a cocto on tara

Commission exercise its subpoena povers against hin?

IT. Rankin thought that if there mas

a Iisk involved for the defector, the

Comnission would not do so. However,

Rankin pronised to get a formal answer

fron the Commission on this point.

#111 the classification we put on our correg

pondence to the Commission be hozored?

The answer was that in principle our

classiftcation: would be honored.

How-

ever, i. Rankin. yarned those present

that CiA should not hope to evade criti-

fication of its material.
