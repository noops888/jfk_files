legitimately, NOLL is planning, with MANNARINO's sanction,

to set up a

card game in the back room of the restaurant,

well as a baseball pool when the season opens and in addition

will write numbers from the restaurant itself.

I-4 pointed out that NOLL mentioned to him in recent conversation

that he served some time in the penitentiary and indicated that

SAM MANNARINO, his close associate for many years, would take

good care of him because he had something on MANNARINO.

MIKE GEORGE HAZIDAKIS

1013 Third Avenue

New Kensington, Pain

T-4, on February 24, 1958, pointed out

that he has known

HAZIDAKIS since 1932, and added that for the past twelve

fifteen years HAZIDAKIS has been a trusted lieutenant of "the

MANNARINO organization, directly responsible to KELLY MANNARINO.

I-4 went on to say that at the present time HAZIDAKIS, along

WIth JOHN PONTANA, is actively supervising the Baghana

shay panes

for holding large amounts of cash and making a final account-

ing of the proceeds taken in each night to the MANNARINO

brothers.

I-4 mentioned the on many occasions KELLY MANNARINO has told

him that he trusts HAZIDAKIS implicitly in money matters and

has absolutely no hesitancy in relying on him to turn over

every cent made on the gambling

tables.

Byway of background information, I-4 explained that

around 1932, HAZIDAKIS was convicted in United States District

Court, Pittsburgh, for giving false testimony at a

naturalization hearing in which he testified that a fellow

countryman from Greece was deserving of citizenship in the

United States and had no prior convictions. According to I-4,

the individual seeking citizenship had several past arrests

which were brought to light and HAZIDAKIS was convicted and

sentenced to serve several months in the Westmoreland County

Jail.

T-4 pointed out that HAZIDAKIS has a wife and teen-age son

living in Athens, Greece, and that HAZIDAKIS has told him.

on many occasions

that he is very proud of the son's scholastic

ability and the progress he is making in high school..

T-4

stated that from conversations with HAZIDAKIS he believes

the son, in addition to attending high school in Athens, is

receiving private instructions from a tutor, and that the boy

is apparently possessed with a very high 1a.

T-4 went on to say that in his opinion HAZIDAKIS is worth

at least a half million dollars in American money and would

actually like to return to Athens, Greece, permanently if

it were not for KELLY MANNARINO and his influence over him.

T-4 explained that about a year ago HAZIDAKIS visited his

family in Athens and indicated to him before he left that

he might stay in Greece permanently.

• T-4 stated that several

months later, after HAZIDAKTS

returned from Greece and[from

conversations with him, he gathered that KELLY MANNARINO

either ordered HAZIDAKIS back to the United States or sent

someone over to Greece to bring him back.

T-4 said that

HAZIDAKIS is actually terrified of KELLY MANNARINO and in his

opinion only stays in the United States for fear of winding

up with a bullet in his head if he refuses to follow KELLY

MANNARINO's orders.

According to I-4, HAZIDAKIS is also afraid that he is aying

of cancer and has

consulted many doctors and visited

several of the major medical clinics in the United States

where. he has been assured that he does

not have cancer, but

he still continues to worry over the situation needlessly.

T'-4 stated

that he recently learned

by HAZIDAKIS is located in Perias, Greece, rather than

Athens, and described the building as a large office-type

building, occupied for the most part by doctors and professional

men with

the main floor of the building being leased out to

merchants.

on the evening of March 14, 1950, betweer

the hours of 7:00 p.I. and 10:30 p.m. According to I-4,

T-4 went on to say that although his

contact was actually in the MANNARINO residence at the time

of the meeting for the purpose of assisting Mrs. MANNARINO

in preparing supper for the group, he could not overhear

any conversation in the living room since he was obliged

. to

nemain in the kitchen the entire evening. T-4 stated,

however, that his contact did overhear SAM MANNARINO mention

as the guests were departing that he planned to return to

would probably keep him there for at least thirty days.

Influence over the Pennsylvania

State Police, Greensburg, Pa.

T-4, on March 10, 1958, explained that he has been closely

associated with Captain JAMES MARONEY, Officer in Charge of

the Greensburg State Police Post since 1921 and furnished

the following information regarding the influence of the

MANNARINO organization in Greensburg:

T-4 described Captain MARONEY as an honest and dedicated law

enforcement officer who,

since his transfer to the Greensburg

Post around 1954, has often confided to him that he woula

like very much to crack down on the influence of the

MANNARINO organization but is actually powerless to do so.

By way of background explanation, I-4 pointed that during

the period 1951-1952, after serving for a brief perioa as

Acting Warden of

the

Western State Penitentiary in Pittsburgh,

MARONEY was transferred to the Pennsylvania State Police Post

at Washington, Pa., some distance from his home in Greensburg,

Pa., and was most anxious to arrange a transfer to Greensburg

as quickly as possible in order to be near his family..

T-4

explained that around 1954, he visited MARONgY at the

Washington State Police Post and that MARONEY expressed

care atten be he ate him a tremenon o was

Jc.

then in Harrisburg,

Greensburg,

but had not made good on that promise.

T-4 stated

that several weeks later he happened to see DENT personally

and mentioned to DENT that MARONEY appeared to be very unhappy

with his assignment in Washington, Pa., to which DENT replied

that MARONEY would soon be transferred

to Greensburg, providing

proper arrangements could be worked out with him as to the

manner in which he would enforce the law in Westmoreland

County.

I-4 said that within two weeks time, MARONEY was

transferred to the Greensburg Post and that in many conversations

with MARONEY since that time,

thelatter has implied that he was

compelled to promise TOM TANNAS, the contact man of the

MANNARINO organization and City

Clerk of Arnold, Pa., that he

would not take any action in line with his official duties

to disrupt gambling in New Kensington or Arnold, Pa., without

first clearing with the County District Attorney who,

according to I-4, is backed by TANNAS and the MANNARINO

organization.

T-4 said that EARL KIME (phonetic), the present District

Attorney for westmoreland County, would like very much to

run for the vacancy on the County Bench created by the recent

death of County Judge BAUER, but that TANNAS has instructed

him to stay in his present position as District Attorney,

where he can do the most good for the MANNARINO organization.

On BAUER, 0516-200

T-4 stated that in his opinion, any approach to the present

District Attorney for Westmoreland County or First Sergeant

JOHN P. HELFENSTEIN of the Greensburg State Police Post on

behalf of the FBI or any law enforcement agency would result

in the MANNARINO brothers being notified within "five minutes."

T-4 said that from personal knowledge, he knows that Sergeant

HELFENSTEIN has

been paid regularly by GABRIEL MANNARINO for

the past fifteen years and would not hesitate to do anything

to protect them.

T-4 added that Captain MARONEY has told him

on many occasions that he is "disgusted"

over the circumstances

under which he must assume his command at the

Greensburg Post

but has pointed out that he only has a few years left before

retirement and has tried to rationalize the situation in this

manner.

Nu-Ken Novelty Company

1263 Third Avenue

New Kensington, Pa.

On February 28, 1958, I-4 stated that for the past fifteen

to eighteen

years, the MANNARINO brothers have had a complete

monopoly on the distribution of pinball machines in New

Kensington and Arnold, Pa.

T-4 estimated that the MANNARINO

brothers have from 300 to 400 pinball machines placed in

practically every restaurant, bar, hotel and other places of

business in the above area and that distribution is made

through the facilities of the Nu-Ken Novelty Company. I-4,

who personally owns and operates a place of business in

New Kensington, Pa., explained that he has a pinball machine, belonging

to the MANNARINO brothers and distributed through the Nu-Ken

Novelty Company, in his place of business. T-4 explained that

the MANNARINO pinball machine in his place of business takes

in anywhere from $35 to $50 a week, adding that the MANNARINO

brothers for a number of vears have been operating the following

scheme in regard to the collection of money from pinball

machines. According to T-4, the scheme is worked

through the

collection men who make weekly calls to pick up money taken

collection man writes out a receipt to the proprietor for

only $25.00, the

additional $25 being split between the

MANNARINO brothers and the proprietor. T-4 pointed out that

he has been operating under this type of an arrangment with

the MANNARINO brother's since 1952. I-4 went on to say that

as far as the receipt is concerned in the example given above,.

the proprietor's profit for tax purposes: would be shown as :

$12.50 while the

Nu-Ken Novelty Company would déclare a

taxable

profit of the same amount. T-4 added that operating under this

arrangement, the MANNARINO brothers have been able to make

tremendous amounts of money with a minimum amount of worry

over being discovered by the Internal Revenue Service since

it would be most difficult to prove the violation involved.

I-9, on March 7, 1958, advised that the MANNARINO brothers

have around 300

to 400 pinball machines operating in New

Kensington and Arnold, Pa., distributed through the Nu-Ken

Novelty Company with each machine believed to be averaging

between $30 and $50 a week. T-9 said that the MANNARINO

she pointed out that because of constant arguments with her

mother over the way in which she conducts her social life,

she plans to leave home within the next few weeks to live

with her brother and sister-in-law in Georgia permanently.

SUPRANO was very hostile and refused to enter into a

discussion concerning JOHN FONTANA or the MANNARINO brothers

adding that she did not want to become involved in the

situation and had no intention of cooperating with the FB1.

In the opinion of the interviewing agents, SUPRANO is a -

completely unreliable and unpredictable teenager. Consequently,

she will not be recontacted for development as a PCI.

CONNIE OLZEWSKI, beautician,

Kaufmann's Department Store,

Pittsburgh, on March 1l, 1958, was re-interviewed by

SAS THOMPSON and DOUCE

for the purpose of further examining

her potential as an informant and also to develop, if

possible, further information regarding her dates with

GABRIEL MANNARINO as previously reported by PG 564-c on

December 11, 1957.

OLZEWSKI was extremely hostile and flatly

refused to enter into a discussion regarding GABRIEL MANNARINO

emphasizing that she was absolutely inno position to furnish

information regarding his activities.

She again flatly

(denied ever accompanying GABRIEL MANNARINO on out-of-town

trips and made it very clear that she did not want to become

involved with anything that had anything to do with the

MANNARINO brothers.

OLZEWSKI explained

that she is nearing

the completion of her apprenticeship at the Kaufmann Beauty

Salon and will soon receive her license after which she fully

intends to leave the city with one of her co-workers to open

a beauty shop, possibly in Florida.

Following the interview on March 11, 1958, several attempts

were made by the interviewing agents to make an appointment

with OLZEWSKI for an interview either at her home in

or at the Pittsburgh Office but she absolutely

refused to meet or cooperate with the interviewing agents.

In view of OLZEWSKI's attitude, no further attempts will be

made to develop her as an informant.
