On November 16, 1977 the Select Committee interviewed

Thomas C. Mann, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico at the time

of President Kennedy's assassination. (HSCA Interview, T.

Mann, JFK Doc. 003966) The Mann interview was prompted by

the Committee's two-fold interest in Oswald's pre-assassination

trip to Mexico City and the subsequent post-assassination CiA-EIT

investigation of Oswald's activities in Mexico

City by the

CIA and FBI. Ofimore specificinterest.to the Committee was

learning from Ambasador Mann the extent of his efforts to

investigate Oswald's Mexico City activities; especially

whether Oswald had conspired with Castro Cubans to assassinate

President Kennedy. IIbid

During the course of the Mann interview, the Ambassador

indicated that he had received instructions from the State

Department to cease his efforts to confirm or refute tumors

goverant

of cuban complicity in the assassination. Fift w

was Mann's be-

lief that CIA and FBI representatives had received similar

instructions from their respective directors.

Thus, by November 27th signs of conflict with respect

to U.S. investigative policies in Mexico City had surfaced.

The record also reflects that by November 27th,

Alvardo's allegation was being thoroughly scrutinized by

American authorities in Mexico City. Alvarado was undergoing

a detailed reinterrogation conducted by CIA representatives

at a CIA safehouse.

Johnson's "better perspective" was cabled to Mann that

day. Johnson stated in his cable that the FBI was to be

considered in full charge of the investigation.

He also

informed Mann that Oswald's presence in New Orleans from

September 17 through September 25 had been established

in conflict with Alvarado's statement that Oswald had been

in the Cuban Consulate on September 18.

Therefore, John-

son stated that sufficient validity had not been established

to justify the arrests suggested by Mann. * (state Dept.

Though the record does disclose, as detailed above,

that Mann's efforts to investigate the possibility of Cuban

omplicity in the assassination were being limited, the recor

him while promising the hope of future assistance should

Apparently a jurisdictional conflict over Alvarado's

custody and interrogation had begun to develop between the

FBI and CIA.

On the morning of November 29, Alvarado was interro-

further interrogated for three hours that afternoon. At

the close of these sessions, the Mexican interrogator con-

carry out the assassination. (FBI File 105-

It should be noted with some concern that while the

cable traffic reviewed indicates

that Alvarado gave a full

confession of his fabrication, the summary of his interro-

gation by the Mexicans is not so precise.

A CIA translation of the Mexican interrogation states

in part:

a. That spontaneously, and after reconsideration,

he desires

to state that the North American to

whom he had referred in the body of his state-

ment and whom he saw on 18 September of this

year in the Cuban Consulate looked like, and

he was 60% sure that he looked like, Lee Harvey

Oswald, the assassin of the President of the

United States. (emphasis added)

b. That after the assassination of President Kennedy,

Alvardo took advantage of these occurrences,

giving versions such as the above one, for the

purpose of provoking a strong reaction in favor

of the United States against the government of

Fidel Castro Ruz.

(CIA Doc. DDP4-2741, Memo from R. Helms to J. Lee

Rankin, 6/1/64, Attachment F, p5)

As the above quotation clearly indicates, Alvarado

did not in fact completely retract his original allegations.

In addition the record does not indicate whether Ambassador.

Mann or the FBI and CIA representatives in Mexico City had

access to the Mexican interrogation report as of November 30th

when Alvarado's retraction was reported to FBI and CIA Head-

quarters.

On December 2, Alvarado spoke with

his Nicaraguan

case officer.

During their meeting, Alvarado asserted that

he had been coerced into admitting that his story was a

fabrication.

was reported to CIA headquarters by the Mexico City Station.

The Station also noted that Alvarado was to be deported to

the Mexican authorities. Mann noted that Alvarado's story

was still flawed by his placement of Oswald in the Embassy

on September 18 and his contention that he had telephoned

the American Embassy in Mexico City prior to the assassina-

tion to report his observations at the Cuban Consulate on

September 18th.*

Thus, the record tends to support the conclusion that

Alvarado had not telephoned the Embassy during late September

1963 as he had alleged. Fi

addition, a CIA polygraph operator was being sent to Mexico

City on December 4. Clarke Anderson was designated as the

Although not explicitly stated,

the hearings referred to likely were Warren Commission hear

The Warren Commission was established by Executive

Order 11130 on November 29, 1963. This date may as well

explain why greater efforts were not made to polygraph

Alvarado while in Mexican custody.

HSCA Conclusions

The record reviewed by this Committee, as set forth

above, supports the following conclusions:

1) Immediately following President Kennedy's assassina-

tion the possibility of Cuban involvement was

given

serious consideration by United States government re-

presentatives in Mexico City. Cuban complicity was

of particular concern to the American Ambassador,

Thomas Mann. His suspicions were based upon Oswald's

past contacts with both the Cuban and Soviet Consulates

in Mexico City, the allegations of Gilberto Alvarado

Ugarte, and suspect conversations between the Cuban

President Dorticos and the Cuban Ambassador to

Mexico Armas. Beçause of Mann's immediate posture

he intervened himself into the United States in-

vestigation of Oswald's activities in Mexico City.

Both CIA and FBI representatives in Mexico City had

to contend with the Ambassador and probably felt

that his efforts only further complicated an already

complex situation. Therefore, CIA and FBI representa-

tives in Washington, D.C. were able to impress upon.

that Mann was not in charge of the investigation

and

should be so informed. It is most likely, as

a result, that Mann's statement to this Committee

that his efforts to investigate the possibility of

a Cuban assassination conspiracy were prematurely

cut off reflect the instructions he received from

the

his superiors that the FBI was in charge of Mexico

City investigation, necessarily implying to Mann that

he was not. However, the Committee has found no

evidence to support Mann's contention that CIA and

FBI representatives in Mexico City received instruc-

tions to cut off investigations of possible Cuban in-

volvement in the assassination. But it is the Com-

mittee's contention that both the CIA and FBI were

subject to political considerations created by the

extraordinary circumstances surrounding the assassina-

tion. In particular, Mann's request that Cuban di-

plomatic personnel be arrested created an issue

pregnant with serious consequences, at the very least,

2) The record does reflect that both CIA and EBI re-

presentatives in Mexico City fully cooperated dur-

ing the course of the investigation of Alvarado's

allegation. Nevertheless, the Committee review of

FBI and CIA files tendsto show that by November 27,

1963, prior to Alvarado's interrogation by Mexican

authorities, FBI and CIA doubted Alvarado's vera-

city. As a

I result, the subsequent investigation of

Alvarado was colored by the CIA and FBI preten

that Alvardo was a fabricator. Whether this

5)

stance ultimately affected the resolution of Al-

varado's allegation cannot today be determined.

The record further reflects that Ambassador Mann,

following Alvarado's polygraphying by CIA and FBI,

reports on December 6 agreeing with the FBI and

CIA position that Alvarado was a fabricator. How-

over, Ambassador Mann persisted in his belief,

though not supported by the evidence, that the Cuban

government was in some manner connected to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

A) From FBI and CIA files reviewed, the record tends

to show that the FBI and CIA investigation in

Mexico City was subject to some jurisdictional

uncertainty. Whereas, with regard to the Alvardo

investigation, it was the FBI's initial stance

that this was a OlA matter, the CIA did not become

actively involved in resolution of the issue until

it had received authorization to do so from the

FBI. However, this concern of proper jurisdictional
