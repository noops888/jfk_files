Information to the effect that subject

be in

Spain was furnished on a confidential basis to JORGE VAZQUEZ M

ROBLES, Chief of the Inspection Service of Mexican Immigra-

tion. 'He advised

that they had no information to confirm

or deny this report although he noted that this may relate

to the postcard he previously furnished

subject from Palma de Mallorca, Spain.

JOAN BANNISTER, Secretary, Bureau of Narcotics

and Dangerous Drugs, American Embassy, Mexico City, has

been contactod regularly on this matter because her mother

is a resident of Cuernavaca, a realtor and a friend of RUTH

DORNBERG, who apparently was administering the house at

Nubes 2 in Cuernavaca.

Her mother is aware of the identity

of subject and is cooperative but does not want to become

involved.

12-3/12-61

The mother, Mrs. ALIXE REED, recently reported

that while in Cuernavaca

subject was

associating with a

woman known as "Cantamaya" who ran a shop on Galeana Street

in Cuernavaca: This confirms reported information of an

association between subject and ELIZABETH MOHL GIMBEL, known

"Cantamaya." However, since she is an associate of the

subject, it is not considered feasible to attempt direct

contact

with her.

RN

Mrs.

REED

continues to indicate that from infor-

mation available to her from

Nubes 2 remains for sale.&

gerous Drugs, was in Cuernavaca 2/22/69 and attempted un-
