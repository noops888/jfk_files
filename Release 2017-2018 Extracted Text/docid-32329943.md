being run by one GRADY FORD.

The detectives

got HALL drunk prior to the trip and

he lost

$60,000 in a dice game. When he sobered up he refused to

pay, but according to a reliable source he subsequently

settled the debt with a payment of $10,000. This same source

further advised in another incident in which GADDY and SMART.

took HALL to a poker game in

a Dallas hotel, he lost $3,400.

A complaint was made by HALL's cousin, Dallas automobile

dealer w. O. BANKSTON, to the then Chief of Detectives, WILL

the matter with the detectives but was told by them to "Leave

their business alone". No report of the incident was ever

made to the Chief of Police by FRITZ.
