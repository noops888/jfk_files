Re:

John Paul Du Bois, Also Known As

Dear Deputy Morrisett:

This letter will confirm

a conversation

between Special Agent Julian J. Miller of the Phoenix

FBI office and yourself on October 1, 1976.

Information was received from the Los Angeles

BI Office that Dane arrived at the Los Angeles

international Airport on May 6, 1916, and was interviewe

at u.s. Custons.

In his possession

two suitcases.

When asked if these bags were his, Dane

replied they resembled his, however,

he could not be

sure as

upon his arrest in Guatamala, his belongings

were seized and

searched. Dane refused to examine the

luggage

for verification.

Dane stated he had no monies other than that

which was on his person.

No cameras, money, or airplane

tickets were located in his luggage.

As Dane would not

claim the luggage, a complete inventory of the suitcases

was not made and

the suitcases were transferred as one

unit with Dane to the U.S. Marshal, Los

Angeles,

and subsequently to the U.S. Marshar,

SUBJECT: Missing Property

S1T,

May I respectfully draw your attention to the enclosed list, that represents

items missing from my property after a full inventory search was conducted

by myself, and in the presence of police officers at Chandler City Jail, on

25 June 1970.

This was the first time since my arrest, such an examination had been auth-

orised.

The last time I saw any of the missing items was in Guatemala City, 6 May

1976, where in my presence they were packed into three units of baggage,

after which, also in my presence, they were checked in at the Pan American

Airlines counter for transier to

pol, I was not permitted to retain

any property enroute.

After my involuntary entry into the United States, I was not permitted to re-

examine the baggage and check the contents, as the baggage was picked up by

tro Los Angeles FBI agents.

To the best of my knowledge, the baggage re-

mained in FBI custody until it was reportedly transfered to the Los Angeles

US Marshal's office. Requests to the IS Marshal's office to conduct an

examination of my baggage were denied.

The baggage was then reportedly, transfered via the IS Mail Service, to your

ffice in Phoenix, where again repeated requests to examine my baggage was

lenied both by your office, and the Maricopa County Sheriff's office. Afte

my transfer to Chandler City Jail, police officers there finally permitted

me to examine my baggage under strict supervision, and recorded the loss
