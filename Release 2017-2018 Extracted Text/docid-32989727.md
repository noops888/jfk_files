Chairman Pike. The

Today we have a rather interesting hearing in the realm

of risk. We are interested, all of us, of course, in preserving

our

national

security.

One of che agencies greatly responsible for that is

che Faderal Bureau of Inrestigation.

In the cousse of doing

on the lives of citizens.

So what. we are going to be looking

at today is what the FBI does, wnat its cole is,

Then we will be looking at some of the people whose lives

It has touched. I think we have a largs number of witnesses

today: Mi, james B. Adams, che Assistant to che Diredtor

of the FBI, Mc. W. Raymond Wannall, the Assistant Disector

for FBI Intelligence, will be the FBI witnesses. I propose we

the fBi tescimony firsc and ask them any questions chat

wish to ask the FBI. We will probably not complete any

more than that in the morning session.

In the afternoon I propose we go to some of the testimony

from the individuals. I vould simply asl: that the fBI people

do stay around during the afternoon session so that in the

event they want to offer any rebuttal o1: in the eveni

that other questions arise which should be addresged to

them, that would be possible. Is that a reasonable request?

Mr. Adans. We do have one problem.. We have testimony

scheduled all day tomorrow before the Senate and both of

STATEMENT Or

DIRECTOR, ISI: ACCOPAHIED BY W. FAYHOND WANNALE,

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, FBI INTCLLIGENCE DIVISION:

R. Is SEACKELFORD, SECTION CRIEF; DAVID REAN,

SPECIAL, AGENT, AND KOCH MALLET, SPECIAL ACENT

Mi. Adams. Mc. Chairnan and Members of the Committee:

I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today

to disouss the FBI's domestic intelligence responsibilities.

I chink that it woula ba appcopriate for me to begin

my precentation by outlining in genera. terms the purposes of

FBi domestic intelligence investigations. To ada che

historical perspective necessary to fully understand the FBI's

role in this field over the years, I will briafly describe

for you the ciscumstancas under which the FBI was assigned its

present domestic intelligence responsibilities and how the

Bureau, in response to ever-changing threats to internal.

security, has fulfilled these responsibilities.

It must be recognized thai the FBI's domestic intelli

gence function, as it exists today, derives from the Attorney

General's dual responsibility to enforce congressional enactments

and perform other auties which have been delegated to him by

the President These ther

recommendations to the President with respect to matters

affecting internal security, administering aspects

of the

Government's employee security program, and making determinations

relative to the deployment of the military by the President,

should such

action be necessary to quell civil disturbances.

Because

the. FBI's investigative responsibilities

follow the contours of those entrusted to the Attorney General,

the Bureau's domestic intelligence investigations are, of

necessity, broader than investigations strictly designed to

collect evidence for criminal proceedings. The FBI's domestic

intelligence responsibilities have a distinct anticipatory, or

preventive, purpose, requiring continuing investigative activity

in cases wherein criminal conduct remains a future possibility.

Thus, the objective of FBI domestic intelligence

investigations is to obtain information concerning activities

which are intended to undermine or overthrow the

Government

of the United States, incite domestic violence or rioting,

or deprive individuals of their civil rights. The FBI investi-

gates these threats to domestic security both to develop

evidence for legal proceedings and to provide the Attorney

General with information upon which to make assessments and

policy recommendations pertaining to specific, nonpenal

aspects of the Nation's domestic security program which are

administered by the Department of Justice.

The FBI's domestic intelligence function today has

its origin in instructions issued by President Franklin D.

• Roosevelt as early as 1934.

On May 8, 1934, President Roosevelt ordered the FBI

to conduct an intelligence-type investigation to determine

whether there was a connection between the Nazi movement in

the United States and German diplomatic and other official

representatives in

this country. This investigation of the

Nazi movemen: was conducted along the specified guidelines set

by the President and was not expanded to include other groups

or movements.

However, on August 24 and August 25, 1936, President

Roosevelt instructed former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to

obtain what Mr. Hoover characterized as "general intelligence

information" concerning "subversive activities in the

United States, particularly Fascism and Communism."

In response to President Roosevelt's request, FBI

Director Hoover issued instructions for the development of an

investigative program which would be responsive to the require-

ment imposed upon the Bureau by the President. The investigative

program undertaken by the FBI pursuant to these instructions

is being continued today in accordance with directives embodied

in Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 0.85, which.

sets forth the general functions of the FBI.

HN 54980 DocId:32989727 Page 10

## Page 11

By 1938, the FBI had developed the broad outlines of

a domestic intelligence investigative program to fulfill the

President's request for information about subversive activities

in. the United States. By letter, dated October 20, 1938,

then Attorney General Homer Cummings forwarded to President

Roosevelt a memorandum from FBI Director Hoover, outlining

how the President's 1936 instructions were being implemented

by the Bureau.

this time, President Roosevelt was informed

that the FBI was investigating subversive activities and

that the results of its investigations were being broken

down for ready reference by subject matter, including,

"Maritime; government; industry (steel, automobile, coal

..mining, and miscellaneous) ; general strike; armed forces:

educational institutions; Fascisti; Nazi; organized labor;

Negroes, youth; strikes; newspaper field; and miscellaneous."

On November 2, 1938, President Roosevelt advised

that he approved of Director Hoover's plan. The investigative

program in the field of domestic intelligence which President

Roosevelt had instructed the FBI to begin in 1936, and the

general scope of which he approved in 1938, was reaffirmed

in subsequent years by succeeding Presidents.

Almost from its inception, the FlI's domestic

intelligence role was recognized as a functional element

in the overall United States national security effort, and

appropriate mechanisms were devised to integrate the FBI's

investigations in this field with the activities of the military

services. Pursuant to a Presidential Directive, dated

• June 26, 1939, the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference

was formed as an independent committee with FBI Director Hoover

as its Chairnan. The purpose of the Interdepartmental Intel-

ligence Conference was to coordinate the FBI's foreign and

domestic security investigations with the activities of the

military intelligence agencies and to facilitate the exchange

of information of mutual interest.

When the Congress established the National Security

Council to achieve national policy-level coordination of

United States security programs, overall policy supervision

of intelligence investigations conducted by the FBI as a

member agency of the Interdepartmental Intelligence

Conference was transferred to the National Security Council.

The National Security Council retained policy-level

supervisory responsibility for FBI domestic intelligence

programs until President Kennedy ordered this responsibility

transferred to the office of the Attorney General, where it

has remained since 1964.

With the historical origins of the FBI's domestic

intelligence responsibilities in mind, let us review how

the FBI has fulfilled these responsibilities over the years

in response to ever-changing threats to the domestic security

of the United States.

Between 1936 and 1938, as the FBI moved to develop

a domestic intelligence investigative program in response to

the President's 1936 instructions, the world situation

steadily worsened as Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany,

Italy turned to Fascism, and Japan moved toward an expansionist

policy in the Pacific. In the United States concern was growing

over the danger of potential espionage, sabotage, and subversion.

In 1940, the Congress passed the Smith Act, which

was directed against communist subversion. During World War

II, of course, the main priorities of the FBI were directed

towards thwarting espionage and sabotage efforts intended to

undermine the war effort.

After World War II, as the Iron Curtain descended

across Europe and the wartime alliance with the Soviet Union

changed to cold war, the problem of domestic communism

became of grave concern to the American people. Passage of

the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, the Internal

Security Act of 1950, and the Communist Control Act of 1954,

represented congressional expressions of this concern.

- 6 -

HH 54980 DocId:32989727 Page 13

---

## Page 14

4126

The FBI reacted too, and the Bureau's investigation

of communist activity in this country led to the exposure of

the conspiratorial nature of international communism.

The decade of the 1950's brought new threats to

our free society as night riders of the Ku Klux Klan sought

to terrorize citizens through bombings, burnings, and other

acts of violence.

As the Klan's threat to the national welfare grew

to a general patten of organized violence, the FBI moved

to provide all-out assistance, including close checks on the

activities of Klan members suspected of involvement in criminal

activities.

The FBI's intensive investigation of the activities

of the Ku Klux Klan echoed the strong determination of our

Nation's elected representatives to oppose the type of

discrimination that the Klan practiced in its most violent

form. During this period Congress enacted the Civil Rights

Acts of 1948, 1964, and 1968..

The 1960's brought other forms of threats to the

Nation to which both the FBI and the Congress reacted. Rioting

in our cities was described as the most difficult intelligence

problem in the Department of Justice by the Attorney General

in 1968. Congress responded to this wave of violence in that

year with the passage of Antiriot Laws.

The President of the

United States; in appointing a Special Advisory Commission

on Civil Disorder, stated that public officials had "an

immediate" obligation "to end disorder" using every means

at.:

• (their). command."

The President warned "if your

response to these tragic events is only business-as-usual,

you invite not only disaster but dishonor."

In response to this new threat to public order,

the FBI conducted extensive investigations of extremist

activities, which had, by 1967, become a severe national

problem. During the first nine months of 1967, racial

violence in

67 cities cost 85 lives, injured 3,200 Americans,

and resulted in property damage of over $100,000,000.

During the late 1960's, college campuses also

experienced a "rising tide of intimidation and violence,"

in the words of University of Wisconsin faculty members.

College and university activities were frequently halted by

seizures of buildings, detention of faculty and administrative

officials, and other outrages. During the 1968-1969 academic

year, there were demonstrations on over 200 college campuses,

many involving arson, bombings, and other violence.

In 1970, the Congress passed a

series of laws

aimed at the control of bombings across the country. In

September of that year, the President's Commission on Campus

Unrest, noted, "It is an undoubted fact that on some campuses

there are men and women who plot, all too often

successfully,

to burn and bomb, and sometimes to maim and kill. The police

must attempt to determine

whether of not such a plot is in

progress, and, if it is, they must attempt to thwart it."

In response to these threats, FBI Special Agents

were already conducting investigations to identify individuals

and organizations posing a threat of violence. Organizations

whose members' activities were exceytionally violent were

the subjects of intensive investigations.

New forms of violence which represent threats to our

domestic security have emerged as others pass into obscurity.

Today, the FBI faces new, complex, challenges in combating

such activities.

For example, the Bureau must face the problem

of terrorism, or violent criminal activity designed to intimidate

for political purposes. From 1971 through 1974 there were

641 reported terrorist incidents, including such acts as

bombings, firebombings, ambushes, and police killings.

Violence of this kind has confronted the FBI with

the task of investigating small, highly secret and mobile

groups of criminals styling themselves in the image of the

guerrilla soldier, who have adopted his jargon of urban warfare

and his revolutionary political ideology.

- 9

## Page 17

4129

Some of these groups have become expert in fashioning

• false identifications. Their tactics include kidnapings,

hijackings, bombings, assassinations, and armed robberies to

finance further revolutionary activities. Unfortunately,

the law enforcement officer, our first line of defense against

such groups and the most visible symbol of Government, is

frequently the first target of their violence. Self-styled

urban guerrillas

have been linked to the murder of 43 police

officers in this country since 1971; and another 152 officers

have been wounded in related incidents.

You should be aware that terrorists have vowed to

"bring the fireworks". to our Nation's Bicentennial celebration

next year. I believe some will try who are perfectly capable

of fulfilling this threat.

Last January, 4 persons died and 53 others were

injured in

a bomb explosion at the historic Fraunces Tavern

in New York City. Responsibility for this explosion was claimed

by a group calling itself the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican

Liberation.

Many feel that this savage act in New York could be

a prelude to more devastation as July 4, 1976, approaches.

The American people may rightfully expect their public officials

to anticipate and prevent such violence.

- 10 -

HH 54980 DocId:32989727 Page 17

## Page 18

4130

The FBI has no desire to oppose. legitimate dissent.

Nevertheless, it is our grave responsibility to investigate

domestic violence of this kind. It is a difficult assignment,

• but one which the FBI will continue to perform vigorously with

-whatever lawful resources are available to it.

Most Americans are genuinely concerned with such

threats to our domestic security and recognize the need of

their Government, through the exercise of its law enforcement

power, to respond. You should also be aware, however, that

there are others who have as their ultimate goal' the overthrow

of our political institutions and economic system. These

individuals publicly state that they consider terrorist

activity (quote) counterproductive (quote) in today's

political climate. Nevertheless, they by no means renounce

its use at the right moment to attain their objective.

As I indicated to you at the beginning of my remarks,

we in the FBI appreciate the opportunity to offer our

observations concerning intelligence investigations by the

Bureau designed to protect the domestic security of the Nation.

It is our hope that out of the current congressional assessment

of the FBI and its proper role, the American people will be

assured that their Nation's law enforcement and domestic security

interests will be protected effectively and in a manner consistent

with the policies declared by their elected officials.

Permit me to conclude my remarks by stating my hope

that out of improved communications between the FBI and, the

Congress,. a balanced picture of the Bureau's domestic

intelligence role will amerge which, in addition to identifying

any weaknesses in its past performance, also recognizes its

accomplishments and preserves for the FBI the necessary

flexibility to successfully fulfill domestic security

responsibilities.of ever-increasing complexity.

In this connection, I should reiterate our willingness

to report to the Congress concerning our performance in this

field and adherence to rules established for us. . It is our

view that establishment of a joint Senate-House oversight

committee would greatly facilitate this process and avoid

duplication of testimony and the proliferation of highly

sensitive information.

Nevertheless, whatever mechanism is eventually

established to maintain communications between the FBI and

the Congressi: I am sure that we can all agree on the necessity

of preserving the Bureau's ability to function effectively as

a deterrent to criminal violence by those who seek to undermine

our Constitution.

Mx. Chairman, that concludes my statement. I would

be happy to answer your questions.

I personally visited down at the FBI. I know that in

of the classified information, that you have cooperated

subsequent to that time with additional material for the benefit

of our committee and for this hearing.

The thing that concerned me then and concems me now

is whether or not in addition to the activities abouc which

you have testified . are there any private, sort of ad hoc

activities which are carried on by the Directos of the FrI,

or any other personnel?

Iknow that there were private files

that were kept by a former Director of the FbI. Are there

any such private files about individuals being kept now?

ME. MCCLOLY. Yes.

Mir. Adams. No, sir, noc in chat context.

MI. MCCLOLY. How about the release of information of the

FBI?

For instance, for a long tims there existed a sort of

arrangenent whereby a President of the United States or others

in the

detailed information about whatever individual they sought

information from the private files of the FBI, Has that

the Act itself did not provide for such

So the fact of the matter is that the FBI

the FBI with regard to wiretapping

and it is a practice

that the FaI has not admitted to but about which we have some

information thai leads un to believe that it went on in the

past and I am wondering if it has been stopped - is this

business of reliable informants.

We understand that the FBI will go into a town, say.

Chicago where I an from; and they will get a local policeman

or some local police force to do viretapping for them. They

pass this information on to a strike force then made up of

FBI agent, Justice representative, IRS agent. Then, when

they go to court and they are asked where the evidence came

from they can properly say we did not have anyching to do

with the wiretap.

Do you get any infornation that way that you classify

Not that parcicular situation. If the

Mr. Musphy. We have been advised by Illinois Bell and

they have admitted to the President's Commission on Wiretapping

that they nevor reported in the

last three or four years any

illegal wiretap they came abouc except as to the customer

wose line they found it on. They said they haù no duty to

report it to the rederal authoricies.

I am wondering what your interpretation of theix

Mr. Musphy. I am talking about the Illinois Bell

Telephone Company, the only subsidiary of AIst which does not

report virataps to l'ederal authosities or any authorities.

The rest of the system all does.

I am under the opinion that a citizen in he sees a

crime or knows of a crime being comnitted, he has a duty to

report it to the proper authorities.

Mi. Murphy. Let me ask you a queacion, Mi. Adams.

There vas an inordinate number of ez-FBI agents working

for the ATir and ste subsidiries throughout the countsy.

Is there any purposeful connection there?

Ms. Adams. No.

I think you will. find in any rajor

segment of industry that securicy officers; FBI agents, are

employed in many industries as security officers. I think

they have demonstrated over the years their qualifications.

they do gravitate to good positions in privace industry:

But these is no concerted effori to penetrate or io

control or dominate or do anything of this sort on the part

of IBI agents collectively or individually.

Mr. Murphy. Was it a practice of your department that

when you are summoned before a congressional committee and

queries are presented to you as to how many wiretaps are

existing today in the United Stases, was it your practice

to then, before the Director came down, to send out a

notification, "Take the wiretaps off for a weeit of two so

when I go to the committee I can testify thät as of this day

there are oniy 10 or only 4 domestic wiretaps existing"?

Mt. Adams. Absolutoly not. I triieve the information we

There was no such

Mr. Boover Frankly inposed restzaints on

In fact, sone of the material we made available shows that he

was one of the loudest voiced urging some type of auchozity

and approval in the Attorney General, not only of oues but

other agencies.

Ms. Murphy, All right. I only have five minuces.

Did the FBI ever get infurnacion that. the IRS was

conducting schools on wiretapping?

Mr. Adams. I don't recall whather we had any such

specitie information.

Me. Murphy, We bad a former U.S. Atcorney General tell

us that he acnowledged that the IRs was conquoting informal

schools on wiretap. They bought the equipment and tire

Directoz of the IRS came in and told the agents, "If you get

caught, y0n ace on your own but if you bring in good

information, we will make a scrong case out of it."

What about the 52 informants?

Me. Shackelfox&.

that does not sound proper. I don't

think so.

Me. Kasten. How much would an informant cost?

any question like that.

Mr. Kasten. About $100,'$500, about $1,000?

Mr. Adams, it is time to bring some of the matiers we

are discussing into another perspective rather than looking

at then in linbo. Civil rights have two different

perspectives that should be considered. There have been

numerous press and public adverse criticisms again the YBI

and the seczei Service for their failure to locate and detain

individuals who have secantly allegealy threatened the life

• of the President of the uniced States.

Isn'' it a fact, sis, that discovery of thesa individuals

Mr. Adams: Well, what we are seeking is io obtain a

proper balance, and li is a purpose, I think, that these hear

ings do provide, as well as the hearings in the Senate, that

ve do have to balance the interest of the couniry and try to

satisfy the overall incerests of the Uriced States coupled with

the least intrusion possible into the rights of che individnal.

It is true chere are twenty chouserd people a year murderes

in the United States, and there ace all sorts of brutal crimes

of violence iating piace, and ic times va sometimes wonder who

is the enemy. Are we establishing nore rescrictive safeguarãs

against the law enfoscement agencies to make sure that we don't

repeat abuses nich have taken place in the past, or are we

giving equal concern to the rights of the individuals that are

viotims of the crime. Is the public afraid of us or the

• fact

that they can't walk the strests, at night; they can'e enjoy the

parks, engage in business without being vickins of crime.

That is why guidelines wich congress will derive ouc of

hearings such as this will give us a more clear shot ai what

our role is supposed to be in this area.

Chairman Pike. Ax. Hayes........

Mc. Eayes. Me. Milford would like me to yield a half a

minute, and I will be glad to do it...

Mr. Milford. I wanted

to finalize in this particular

colloquy by stating that violations of civil righes is a

relative matter so far as I am concerned. It would appear that

Thank you for yielding.

lis. Hayes. Mi. Alams, the develoyment of confidential

informonts, I thint, was che of tha tasks, you outlined to

Mr. Milford.

.. :...

Do you think that the fBi has a problem when among those

developments that they have conjured, va find Jack Ruby and

Sara Jane Moore? Do you think there night be something wrong

with the developnent techniques in the FBI?.

It, raans. I don't think thore in anything wrong with

the development technique.. It is such that me develop

individuals, try to verify the informacion they furnish; wa

try to ensure their stability. he are dealing with human

beings, and when you deal with human beings, they, don't always

go according to plan.

. ...

Mt. Hayes. Fron your experience and your carrying out of

your particular responsibilities with the rBI,. would you say

that there is sonething that happens to the stability of the

Rubys and the Moores in the course of being confidential

informants? In other

words, you have ensured their stability

and something cracks them later on.

Mr.

This happens.: I WOUI

like to make a point

that Mir. Ruby was not an informant of the fBi.

We are hung

up on an issue on thai point, but he was contacted on nine

occasions, which we did duly report to the Warren Conmission,

for the purpose of furnishing information, because we thought

he would be in a position to furkish sich, but all of the

reccids show that on none of, chose occasions did he ever

furnish any information.

So he was being contacted as a potential in that regara,

buc actually va were correct. in saying he was not an actual

informant.

...

Sut chings do happen to informants chat we try to guarantee,

we try to ensure, and we constantly renind them not to engage

in excesses, not to sonmit illegal accs.

Mir. Hayes. What happens that & Sara Jane Moore kind of

gets away fron all of chat care and affection?

Mx. Adams. You are dealing with people and -

Mr. Hayes. Just ordinary, folks?.

Mx. Adans. Right; and in the criminal field the informanti

you develop are not recruited from the Sunday schools. They

are recruited from individuals who have knowledge of criminal

activity, and they do sometimas presen: personality problems.

But over the years informants are the backbone of obtaining

information today. Last year, over 5,000 fugitives, FBI:

fugitives, were apprehended, and as a result of informants.

Anocher thousand of subjects were arrested in cases as a

resulc of informants' information.. Over $86 million in contra-

band and stolen property was secovered through informants.

Information furnishad the local police depariments resulced in

another sir thousand fugicives or subjacts being arrested.

They are valuable. They are essential.

Mr. Hayes. Nc. Adans, on page 11 of your testimony, che

riddle paragraph is a call to awareness to us, I assume, be

cause the second sentence begins, "You should also be aware,

however, there

are others who, nave as their ultimate goal the

overthrou of our political insticutions aná econcmic systems."

Then you go on to make a quote that some of these just

don't like the use of sone cercorist techniques at this

point; they think they are counter-productive.

But they

haven't renounced anything.

Does that mean that the FBI will. through its polloy

formation

and activities, continue to watch these pecple to see

hi they do sometime change their mind in the future about how

they would like to bring about economis and political dif

ferences in this country?

Mx. Adans.

organization also states co its members and has as a program

that we don't want to do anyching that might be counter

sometimes not to make a shole lot of sense.. So I can sympa

Furnished us the nome and address of this person writing we

An investigation was opened to determine. They checked, find

out she is a school student:, thay close the case. No further

investigation was

conducted,. but should we have stopped and

never detemined, vell, is this a legicinate contact or a 308-

this was a high school student writing to che Socialisi Workers

From that point on, it is evidently.

Mr. Adams. Right; wa did not continue an investigation

of her to follow her activities, determine her bellets and

difficult legal quescion, but fion our standpoint and from the

law, when an Individual, as in this case, comes in and says he

has been asked to participate in activities against the drafc

boards of an illagal nature -- we didn't contact him; we didn't

direct him. He came to ss voluntarily.

Chairuan Pike. Mr. Lehman,

Me. Letan.

Than's you, Mr.. Chairman.

In 1972, as Chairman of ine Dade County School Board, I

was included as pari of a lind of leadership coalition to deal

with and perhaps prevent any. kind of violence that we, had

anticipated at the Republican Convention, especially on the

beach that year, and in our conversationg with the public

safety people from the beach and from ine county, wa at that

time were more concerned with provocateurs

leading the siolence

and causing the violence than accually the people in the

various organizations that many people thought would be the

problems.

.. ...

One of the indications was that sone aintgistrativa paople

or something was going on that would do the kind of provocateur

work chat vould turn public opixion strongly. against anti-mar

groups, especially the group such as the Viet Nam Veterans

Against the War.

Actually. the Viet, Kum Veterans seemed, 1o

bo at that time on the beach ong of the primary. targets to

focus anti-public opinion.

...

Not related to the beach, but I have heard from reliable

sources that in she VAW that in New Orleans most of the people

In that chapter were people on the FBI payrolls.

Now the Florida chapter of the VAl In Gainesville was

certainly a major target, and this resulted in the wall-

known trial of the Gainesville Eight,. and according to the

; an agent

provocateur and

apparently the jury fouad out that the

provocateur was the source of most of the probiems. and not

the Gainesville Eight, which resulted, of course, in finding

chen not guilty.

Now my problem is I have i0 guarcel wich informers, but I

do have a problem with the possible use of provocateurs, which

are certainly counter-productive. and " would like to ask two

questiona.

The question I would like to ask is, you mentioned before

that you do not use them, but from the infozuation I have

there has been use of provocateurs in different federal agenciel,

and I would like to know whether you have used them and whethex

you are continuing to use them. ande. 16 so. I would like some

ching in this final report of this Connitice that would condemn

the use of provocateurs and to make the necessary legislation

so prevent the further use of provocateurs..

My question to you is, did you use them, and do you use

them?

"Infornation copies of

I know what the FBI, was doing to the teS, but would you

tell me what the nature was of the attack by the IPS in which

I am somehow involved, on the FEI?

Mi. Adams. First, fron the reading as you gave it to me,

there doesn't appear to be any allegation that you vere part

In your view, have the subversive threats to the United

States, and your authoricy for investigating them, changed

in ocher words, your rationale for invescigating the Socialist

correct?

Ms. Hannall. Or for the incelligence needs of roe

you such a record with respect to the Repunlican and Democratic

Mr. Fiold. Are you aware that the violations of law that

you cited back in 1941 were declared unconstitutional, the

portions of the Smith

act which you prosecuted socialist

worisers on, were declared unconstitutional subsequently?

Mr. Wannall. There were portions of it in 1969 in the

Ohio case which were declared to be unconstitutional.

Ni. Field. And the Suprone Court upheld that?

STATERENE OF ARIHUR MURTAGH.,. RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT

MI. Hurtagh. ME. Chaiman and Menners of the Committee:

I welcome this opportunity to testlly before you as a retired

special agent of the FBI who loyally sered the Bureau foc

twenty years and who was assigned to the FBI's Internal

Security Intelligence squad In Atlanta for ten years, from 1960

approximacely until 1971. I would hopu i could give thir

Committee insight into the Bureau's intelligence practices not

from the theorecical vievpoint of a policy maker but from the

pracrical vienpoint of a field agent....

the inrusi of my comments. will be to attempt to have you

see thai it is possibla for the structure of an organization

such as the bureau to be responsible fur much wronggoing

without any measurable culpability on the part of individuals

working in the lower levels of the organization. For example,

I was at one time asked to obtain through my informants

handuriting samples of a gentleman who is now a member of your

body, the Eonorable Andrew Young of Atlanta.. I was also asked

to obtain handwriting samples of several of his associates

In

DI. Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership

Conference. I was an agent with a lot of experience at the

time this request came to me from my superior.. I was aware

thac the manner in which the request was made was such that

the information was to be used for one af the illegal purposes

of the bureau.

the request was made after, regular working hours orally

to me in private. I turned to my supervisor who was known

among the agents as "Colonel Klink" and told him that I flatly

refused to comply with his request and that he could tell his

counterpart at the Buceau

sho, had called him on the watchiine

seeking the informacion that. & knew dam vell it was going

be usil in an unrecorded counterintelligence operacion to

descroy Ni. Young's chances, of getting alected to the House of

Representasives.

The request came oniy a fer days after

Mt. Young had announced that he was seeking a seat in the fouse.

My eupervisor's reaccion vas.

"Row don't get excited.

Art, we wili make some other arrangenent."

.. And. " responded,

•I suppose you will. And I cold him chai le hia coustespast

at the Bureau wanted to force the issue, we would do it in

the open with lots of pablicity. That was the last I heard of

thai reguest icon my supervisos,, and I noticed later that

Mr. Young made it to your august body so I must assume that

my supervisor had no other source ai that time chat could get

the infomation for him. You, of course, will find no record

of the above incident in the bureau files.

I am cognizant of your mandate to investigate the intelli-

gence

operations of the Bureau and of the great mass of

information inat has already been uncovered regarding these

operations.

I believe, however, that a clear, precise

picture of the Bureau's intelligence praccicas can only be

seen

by analyzing the Administrative structure, the entrenched

biases and the pesvasive indocicinated FBI mentality that

command and control their intelligence practices.

In the incident involving. Hepresentative Andrew Young, is

the same request bad been nade to most agents who had reached

the level in the Bureas that I was at chas time, and wich most

of the agents I came in contact, with during the period chat

the loung incident cook place, for that matter, they would

have coucinely complied with their suparvitor's request,

simply because they would have gone through a process which

would have eliminated all those who saw anything wrong with

the type of activity contemplated by their, supervisor.

The oft-tines expressed feelings of all of the parsonnel vork-

ing in conjunction with me on the intelligence squad in

Aclanta during the period

that the Young incident too place

accounts for the fact that the information requesced would

have been routinely obtained. The feeling was that the racial

movaments in which Me. Young was engaged, although not illegal

per se, was inimicable to the value standaris that the squad

members subscribed to.

If it took a little illegal activity

to compromise the movement, then so be it... Past experience

had made it clear to all agents that Mi. Hoover had no sympathy

with any racial novement.

you may justly inquire at this juncture how I happened

to survive in the Bareau it thege selection processes weeded

The answer. was and is that I was

both stubborn and smart erough to keep my rocord good and

clear and chose azound me knew ic.. As an accorney and someone

who balieved in the zule of la. I houldn'e.conforn if it re-

quired me to be dishonest ox, to violace the law, and I knew

the law. I can sorrowfully. say that my views were not shared

by my neers universally in the Bureau. At this point, I rould

• like to interject a note that is not in the written seccion here

and say chac greas nubers of the agents that i worked with

were of the highest calibre,. fine gentionen that I have great

respect for, and ic is not with any. pleasure that i come

here

to relate to you circumstances

that. I think should be correctea.

It is wich a seated. embarrasement that I have to say that

I waS

a member of this organization for as nany years as

• I was

and was unable to come to you during that period.

And back to the transcript.. I joined the FBI as an agent

in 1952 and retired in 1971.

By 1957, the weaknesses in the structure de the Bureau

, hađ

become all too obvious to me... In 1960,, as a result of

adminiscrative action taken against me by Mr. Hoover, on

account of an alleged problen of overweight, I found myself in

& YMCA Ioch in Macon, Georgia, away from my family for a period

of about flve months. During that time, I did a great deal of

soul-searching and reading in an effore to make a decision as

to whecher I should leave the Bureau anú atienpi to expose the

weaknesses in structure, and, I underscore structure at every

point, because it is the structure that is wrong. with the

Bureau and not the agent personnel,. whether I should empose

the weainess in the structure or stay in the Bureau and wait

for a more opportune iime when the prchability of success in

corzecting these wealmesses would be greater. I decided to

remain and obsarve, but I resolzed that I vould under no circu

stances parcicipate in any of the mathical or. illagal activi-

tiAS

that were by then so

prevalent in the Bureau

I was able to obsarve fron ny vantage point in the FBI

that the Bureau was on a collision couise, of collapse which

would result in Congressional investigation, and I said so

openly among agent associates. from 1960 onward until the time

I left the Bureau in 1971... I. counseled with many, yes,

practically all, of the agent-persorel with whom I came in

contact at this time and for the remaining eleven years that

I spent in the Bureau, and found that they were vaguely aware

in 1960 of the process of which I spoak, and they were acutely

awace of it in 1971.

The inherent administrative processes within the Bureau

which I have alluded to before, which advarsely affect the

Bureau's intelligence

functions can be summarized as follows:

Nuber one is secrecy. Mr.. Hoover threw a veil. of secrecy

over the Bureau ac its very inception, though the sreat mass

of information handlod by the Bureau could-be placed on bill.-

boards in the middle of times Square and the public interest

would not block the sidewalks, bui secrecy served many useful

purposes to the Bureau.

It made it impossible for the public

or Congress to know anything. about what was going on inter

nally. It gave the Bureau, oparation an aura of mystery and

croaced a cype of fear and respect for the Bureau which I per

sonally. feel is unnoalthy in a ociety that strives to be, both

democratic and open.

Number two: Complete unfettered control of the process

of selecting personnel. Centlemen, I subnic this is the most

imporeant thing that I will say to you today. complete and

unfectered control of the process of selecting personne..

This is an area to which your Committee should direct its

greatost efforts, for it was, through a selection process eremot

Eron Civil. Service under the sole control of the Director thai

Mr. Hoover was able over' a perlod of nearly Lifty years to

bring in thousands of carefully, salected agent-pecsonnel.who

vere politically disposed to, the righi as he was and then

through a pessonnol system, which offered no possibility at all

for an agent to question Hoover's ethics os methods, to force

thousands of those selected to leave the Bureau in utter aisgust

simply because they had no avenue through which they could alr

grlevancas involving unethical or illegal conduct.. For example,

and I have many, buc I will give you one, a young agent whom

I 3c20w was sent io Albany, Georgia for his First office. Fis

wife was a sociologist. She was oifezed a posicion in the

Head Start Project in Albany. Georgia that was under the diree

tion os a black accorny named hing.. I think his inicials were

A. Bo, but I know his last name was Ring: The agent reported

this infornation to his superior. in Albany.. He was immediately

amoned to tiante by the Agent in Charge and told that his

wife could not tale the job because they did not want FBI

personnel or their wives associated witk Blacks who were active

in the civil rights novenents..

this agent subsequently

resigned in disgusi.

The

third area I want you to cale note of is manipulation

and concrol of the press.

The examples of this subject are legior.

The one that

an most familiar with was the concaries effort to get what was

always

referred co in the Bureav, as "our friends in the media"

to publish personal and very private information taken from

the

wiretay which itself vas of questionable legal validity on

DI. Martin luther King. Of course, the day co-day manipulation

was

accomplished by leaking choice items to our "friends"

It was not at all unconnon. to learn of some politically

damaging information about some leading figure in politics as

having been developed by the. Bureau and then always ac a time

when it would be most damaging to the individual, the information

would some way show up in the Chicago 'Iribune or some other

friond of the Bureau. It the information was more valuable

Fox puzuoses of policical blacknall by holding ii, than by

giving it to the press, it was withheld. The leaked infozma

cion always seaned to involve persons of liberal persuasion.

From my years in the bureau, I can only assume that the Bureau

had deduced that persons of liberal parsuasion are somehow

apc to sleep with aomebody else's wife, drink too much

liquor, on be sexually perverted than ase solid conservatives.

The fourt point in absoluce authoricy at the cop and blind

Loyalcy at the bottom alded by. the selection process.

This question of loyalty is interesting since, of course,

we all like our friends to be loyal to us and ve respect it as

a quality in man. The Watargase hearings vere particularly

infornative on this polnt, as you all recall. Each of the

WitnesseS who

were implicated in wrong-doing in Wacergate

opened their statements with a bit on loyalty and went on io

tell eventually how in the name of loyalty they had violated

the law. The Bureau has lis, parallel in ints concept of blind

loyalty.

I might interject hare I think I saw sone of it a few

mizutes ago.

Personnel have been willing is forego their

own integrity to allow improper, unethical, or illegal activity

by the Bureau to go on unchallenged racher than injure the

Bureau by a public attack which many regard as disloyal to the

Bureau.

Nunber five is the harsh disciplinary measures, and I

understand these way have been

changed somewhat under Mr.

Kelley. The harsh disciplinacy. measures which were the hall-

mar's of Me. Hoover's personnel policy are too extonsive to

go into at lengch here. They somecimes resulted in humorous

Bicuations but very often in very cragic sicuations.

As an lilustration of that, I night say when coming down

here from northern New York, my wife bazame terribly distraught

and she turned it me and said, "Do you tnink they will take

your pension away fron you?". And I assured her, *o, honey,

they won't."

By the nid-1960's these harsh dissiplinary neasures

had

eroded confidence in Hooves among the agent personnel thas the

policy of "tell the man noching" had reached a point where

information could actually get inco the hands of Bureau super

visors, and it still would not get to hoover because the harsh-

ness of the disciplinary, action made, the integrity of all

agents very pliable.

. . .

In a denocracy, domination of a powerful organization

such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation by any segment of

the political spectrum threatens the very existence of

demoszacy.

The process results in the organization being used io aid

the policical and philosophical friends or causns of the leader

and to neutralize any opposition.

Ex. Hoover's vendetca against Dr. Mariin luther Ring

Illustrates this process in a graphic manner...

I submit that the FEI now consticutes a degenerate

dictatorship in which the scructure still remains but from

which public support is rapidly. being withdrawn. I furcher

subnit that such a dictatosship is inompatible wich the

Constitutional. concepts upos which this nation was founded.

I feel that this can be historically paralleled wich the ascen-!

sion of ochar dictatorships chroughout the world.

I make the following reconnindationg.

I recommend that any resom which you consider deal

directly with each of the points I nentioned in the establish-

ment of the process, but I urge you to give particularly

careful attention to the process of agent selection.

In order to insure againsi re-establishment of uncontrol-

lable pover within the Bureau I would suggest the following:

seek the removal of all entrenched personnel. including the

Director, as quickly as is practical, not in a vindictive way,

but for the good of the service... These gentlemen have been

crapped into the system; they have been unculturalized; and

they cantt act differently. chan they act, but they are a

serious threat to the freedom and security of the United

States under our Constitation.

The second thing: Establish a system by which line-level

vary happy to hear fir. Adans say this morning that the Bureau

would be willing ic suomit io an outside control agency.

is only a sad thing they didn't do it twency. years ago and

we worlon"t's here today.

Although there ara some Constitutional quescions involved,

I would reccumend that the control agency be under the

judiciary, time excending the concept of checks, and balences.

and that the cine nesessary. for setting up hearings and resolv

ing difficuities be extremely shost, mayos as listle as seven

days so snat corruptive processes could aot get started.

Number thrse: That all personnel working within the

agency and all new personnel vorking within the agency be se

quired to attend instructional classes given by various educa

cional insticutions throughout the country in which the rights

and duties of Bureau employees would be thoroughly caught so

that ve would not have people like sin MoCora in the Nacezgate

aituation telling the Senate or the House in years to come

that he thought that what was obviously, illegal could be made

legal by the flick of a pen by the Attorney. General or the

Director. This concept was very. prevalent in the Bureau then

I was there. If i. Hoover evar said something, no one ever

questioned whether he was right or wrong, legal or ethical,

Illegal or otherwise. There was never anything taught in the

STATEMENT OF ROBERT HARDY

FORMER FBI INFOREANT

Ne: Handy. Mi. Chairman and cornittee members, my name

is Robert Hardy. I am 37 years old and I live in Cander.

New

versay.

I an married and

the father of four children.

I support mysels and my family as & general contractri. I

have served my country in the U.S. Marine Corps and on

Jane 25, 1971 I becane an FBI informer.

I am not proud that I was an FBI Informer. I am noc

proud of wat happened as a result of my being an infomer.

I only hope and pray that by cominy here soday I can right

some of the wrong that was conmitted. Ferhaps we all can

learn & lesson fron what has happened in my case so that it can

nevar happen again.

On. June 24, 1971, a long tine friend of mine was having

dinner at my house. Ha was upsec.

He had been active in the

anti-war movement in ous area.

He related to me that a plan

to entex the Camden draft board had been discovered by the

FBI and had fallen through. I told him that such a plan was

senseless and I discouraged him from considering any such

action. I was concerned, however, that a group of people,

some of whom I had known for years and considered good,

law abiding Americans, would consider such action in order to

protest the war.

The following day I went to the FBI office in Camden

and asked than for advice. I taid them that I did not want my

keep them posted on developments. I then weni to the group of

people I have jusc mentioned and in & shoct time they had

taken me into cheir confidence as a nember and fellow

sympathiser.

At first the I'Bi instructed me not to present any new

choughis or ideas to the group.

However; alter a while they

encouraged me to suggesi to the group the exact illegal accivity

about which I had originally cone to then. They told ne that

all shey wanteû was enough evidence oi a conspicacy io raid

they cold me that this would be a lot

better than if sone of my Exiends vere charged wiüh the accual

erine itself. I uas groatly contused at this time, buc I

trusced the rsI and eventually I carrica out their wishes.

By nid-July I had gained a strong leadership posicion

within the group. I told the FBI, wich whou I was in daily

contact ai this tine, that this was not quite right. I was no

longer a meze informei, but was zou a promoter or provocataur.

They told na to continue.

Il I may Intesject in the s'caterent here, the vosê

inforner and provocateur was not in iy vocabulary at the

time. These were words that were put on me by the press and

by the FBI aicer the actual crime had taken place, or the

that it became absurd. I was not only encouraging the groug

then with constant noral encouragement. I provided them with

che tools they needed - ladders, copes, drills, bite,

hanners and so forth. I provided then with food to sustain

chem during the course of the preparation. All this was

paid

by the FBI. They paid me also, on a regular basis, for my

services.

known as the Camden 28. They asked me to check to see if they

any guns for self protection since there was a rioting condition

in the Caty of Canden.

Chairman Pike. Go ahead.

Mr. Hardy. They were the most non-violent, well-

intentioned people I ever met in my life. But most of chem

couidn't even tle a knot properly. I am not proud to say that,

with respect to breaking into the drait board, I taught them

everything they knew.

Again breaking from the statement, every draft board

that had been broken into within the United States had been

broken into fron the inside. This was the first draft board

that was to be brokan into from the outside. They had no

STATEMENT OF LOT

PATON, STUDENT, UNIVERSI

OF VIRGINIA

Ms. Paton.

• My name is Lori Paton.

I am now a sophomore at the University.

of Virginia. I am here today to talk with you about something

that happened to me when I was a student at West Morris Mendham

High School in Mendham, New Jersey.

In February of 1973, I was one of about 25

students enrolled

in a social studies course called "Left to Right." As the

title suggests, this course involved the study of the spectrum

of the contemporary American political scene. For a class

assignment, I wrote a letter to what' I thought to be the socialist

Labor Party i requesting information about its programs and

policies. However, I had inadvertently addressed the letter to

the Socialist Worker's Party. At that time, -as I later learned,

the FBI was conducting surveillance of all mail addressed to the

Socialist Workers' Party. Thus, unknown to me, the FBI acquired

my name from the letter.I sent and began a criminal investi-

gation to determine if I was engaged in "subversive activities."

(I have submitted Exhibit A, the FBI memorandum directing that

Investigation.) The FBI contacted the Morris County Credit Bureau

and the Police Chief of Chester, New Jersey and made inquiries

about my family and me. The FBI next appeared at my high school

and told the principal that I was under investigation because

of contact with the Socialist workers'

Party. After the agent

left, my parents and I were notified by a school official of the

investigation. That was when I first became aware that my letter

had been intercepted and that I was the subject of an FBI

NW 54980 DocId:32989727 Page 84

## Page 85

investigation.. My first reaction was anger because I had been

investigated without my knowledge and I felt that at least I should

have been contacted by the agent.

Shortly after .that, our high

school newspaper learned of the FBI's investigation and wrote an

article about it.

This public exposure that I was the subject

of an FBI investigation caused me a great deal of embarrassment

among my fellow students and townspeople. I was subjected to

remarks by other students and I felt I was an object of ridicule.

I was no longer known for myself but instead I became known as

a person who was investigated by the FBI.

I. later became

notorious among townspeople, many of whom felt that I should not

rock the boat. by

making an issue of this incident.

When I became aware of the investigation, I was concerned

about its possible effects on my career plans. I

was approaching

my senior year in high school and was looking forward to college.

My plans were to major in Chinese and to find employment in

government service.

I knew that the fact that I had been

investigated by the FBI might adversely affect my career plans,

particularly if I wanted to work for the government.

I found

this possibility very distressing.

Because of the above concerns, my teacher in the "Left

to Right" course, Mr. Gabrielson, suggested that we ask the

ACLU for advice.

My pacents said that they would support me in

anything I dia, so Mi. Gabrielson contacted the ACLU. At

that time, I wanted to find out what was in my file and

НН 54980 DocId:32989727 Page 85

## Page 86

-3 -

4203

whether it could have an effect on my later life. My lawyer,

Professor Frank Askin of Rutgers Law School, who is with me

today, sent a letter to the FBI. asking why they had investigated

me and if there were any FBI files concerning me. I was shocked

when FBI Director La Prade wrote back denying that I had been

the subject of an investigation. (I attach as Exhibit B

Director La Prade's reply letter.) I realized that the FBI's

denial was false because I obviously had been investigated. At

this point I was very upset over the conduct of the FBI. 'I was

initially surprised to find that I had been the subject of an

FBI investigation but I found it even more incredible that a

representative

of my government would lie to me in this way.

The possibility that I had an FBI file and my disillusionmeni

with the

government's conduct led me to bring a lawsuit seeking

expungement of my file and damages for the violation of my

constitutional rights. That suit is still pending. The

United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled

recently that I was entitled to sue the FBI agents involved

• for damages and injunctive relief.

Ms. Camejo.

My nome is Peter Camajo.. As the Presidential candidate

of the Socialist Workers Party, I would like co thank the

conmiicce for this opportunity, to testify. I realize that

you disagree with many of my views. Until today, the investi

gations of FBI and CIA activitias have not given those of us

uno have been the viccims of shnue agencies an opporcunity

to be heard. Of course, there are many other victins of

these FBI and CIA activities

in addition to the SiP.

Because the FBI speuds so much tire and money crying

so discupt the SWe, I think it's important that I explain

briefly exactly who we are and what we stand fos.

We believe that this society needs to be recognized

on the basio of produccion for humar uceds, noc for private

profit. We think that a political party basea on the working clussi

is nesded. That is why ve are offering candidates in the 1976

elociions.

Bus sicce the exposure of the illegal and unconscitucional

FBI COIUTETPRO taccies, the BI has been crying to fool the

public with a clain that it stopped disrupting political ac

civities basi in April 1971. But we know that's not the

In the fei's ver, the she continues to ba a lagitimate

target for discuption. they have been attenting it for decades

and they are continuins ti right now.

In their public explanations, sometines they say this is

because we are terrorists, or because we are "subversives,"

or because we advocate violence. I would lise to respond to

these charges.

First, the rst itself has provided us vith proof that

theis charges are false. let's 100k at the record. The FBI

admits it began wiretapping our parcy in 1945. Since then

the rBI has not brought a single indictrent against & single

member of the SWe, Noi one indietment against a single

member in thirty years of the tightest imeginable surveillance.

As. was pointed out earlier today, the Democratic and

Republican parties, on the other hand, cannot point to suci

a record.

Secondly: I call your attention to the 1961 FBI memorandum

that launched the "SW Disruption Progran." Here they give

the FBI's seal reason for this war of disruption. this document,

which was never intended for public view, sands in sharp

contrast io cheir public charges of viclent and illegal acts.

I was astonished this norning that the FBi failed to make a

single reference to the COINTELPRO Progran in their

statements-

The new said: "the she has... been openly espousing

is line ... enrough running candidates for pubiic office

and strongly direcsing ansjor supporting such causes as

Castro's Cuba and integration problems arising in the south."

They don't charge us with violence, not assassinationg, not

kidnapping. Our crimes, to the FBi, were cunning candidates.

supporting the fight against segregation, and opposing this

government's criminal. atsanpts to overthrow the Castro regime.

what about the public charges that the FBi makes? Is

the SWP terrorisc? Absolutely

not. We believe, as Marxists

have always believed, that the philosoghy and mechods of

terrorism are damaging to the workers' novement. We believe

that society can only be changed through the effocts of millions,

chrough broad social. forces representing the overwhelming

majority, noi through acts of terror.

Adrocacy of terrorism is incompatible with membership

in the sir.

22d, I repeat, no evidence has ever been

produced by the goverment that the SWP a@vocates or engages in

terrorism or other illegal acts of violence.

To cale up another charge:

meet with socialists from other countries is exchange ideas

and to discuss majos world political developments. But

these are not illegal nots.

We maintain a relationship of fraternai solidarity with

the Fourch interacional. Does this violate the voorhis Act?

No.

We decide ontour own policies and principles thusagi our

own convencions and eledted bodies. And although we

strongly

disagree with the Voochis Act, since it was passed in 1940

we have not been affiliated to the fourth Incernational. No

government agency has over producad any evidence to the

contrary

In a recent editorial condemning the continuing FBI

harassment of the Sociaiist Workers Party, the New York Tines

pointed out that "the SWP is a lagal American political

organization. "

The BI has no evidence to dispuce that. What they ara

trying to do is to effectively outlaw

In their

defense against our suit, in place of evidence of illegal

raduced

by Mars and lenin.

The nocion that some ideas

for evecyone who may disagree wich an administration in power.

If it can be applied to our ideas today, it will be applied

to ochers tomorrow.

Of course, it is already clear that many dissenting

groups other than SWP have been the targets of FBI harassment

and attempted discuption, especially Black individuals and

the Socialist Workers Parsy plans to continue with its landmark

suit againsi the FBI, CIA and similar agencies.

In our opinion, only a tiny corner has been lifted

on the shroud of secrecy behind which the FBi, CIA and other

seccer police agencies operate. Ending this secrecy would be

a big step in the direction of bringing their crimes

to a halt.

The Amezican people need. and deserve all' the facts about

the past and present secter-police operations carried out

Thank you, Ms. Chairman.

i vould lite, with the permission of Chairman Pike,

the FiT against us today. That was

in any illegal activity. They have

admitted that we

are not engaging in any illegal activity or advocating

ricience. Instead they presented. the

"ripe" theory. thai 1s

All we state is that the majority. have a right

to camy out their activiciesand should a small group inter-

fere? That is what wa mean ly revolution, the sighi of the

American people to make basic change, as we did in 1776 and as

aid in 1863.

her we had a majority in this country during the anti-yar

movement, did we win a majoricy? Did the SWP engage in 1jlags1

activities? On the contrary, the FBI knows we sentinue to

advocate only legal and peaceful means to get the policies

of the niced states altered.

Now, I an believe that this "ripe" theory, however,

does apply to the rBI. When they sound it ripe, thay did

engage in illegal activities and when they see the moment

is ripe, they are willing so canty out illegal asts, inolading

violence.

That has bean the case also for other agencies.

I wonder when I lision io them here. They say they must continue

to have informants in our party. Are they waiting for the moment

when it will be ripe, when the majority of the American people

turn to our position and they will turn so violence? We will

certainly not. Our position is well established in oves 30

vears in action befoce you and by endiess evidence and by their

own adnission. What noze can

be asked than that we be treated

like any other party and that the Macergacing of my campaign

and other activities be ended and the full treatment of the

FBI and CIA be brought to light:

Thank You.

STATEMENT OF: KATHY STEDGE-LOVGREN, MEMBER OF THE

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY

Mã. Sledge-lougren. My name is Kathy Sledge-Lougien.

I was born in Spokane, and after attending high school there,

graduated from the University of Washington in 1973 with &

degree in zoology. I am employed by che Vetcrans Administration

Fospital in Cardiological. Reseaich as 1 suigical technician.

I first became acquainicd with, and later joined, the

Young Socialist Alliance while at che University of Washington,

because I, like many other Amezicans at the time, vas very

much against the war in Vietnam, I felt the YSA was an

organization I could agree with. Other organizations were

involved in civil disobedience and acts of viclence, like

"crashing," a cern meaning throwing rocks and breaking

windows,

et cetera, which I did not ther and do not now agree

with. Neither, incidentally, des the SVP.

Also, the YSA and SWP were organizations respected

for their unyielding demand to keep anti-vas demonscrations

peaceful and legal. Accordingly, they were able to organize

large demonstrations which were boch affective and in abiding.

In 1974 a number of things happened to me as a resuit of

an intense FBI Investigation of mo, allegedit for a job

clearance. First, I received a detailed letter from

the Civil Service Connission asked me to answer questions

about my political views and associations, about my marital

CHENT OF ROBERT GEORGE SILVER IAN

BEFORE THE SELECT CO:MITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE

November 18,1975

4219

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, my name :.

is Robert George Silverman, President of Peei Enterprises

Ita. This is my best recollection of a visit to my offices

at Pèer Enterprises Lta. during the fall of 1972 by two

men who identified themselves as agents of the EBI.

I was called in our sixth floor production office

• on

that day, and told the two agents were present and

wished to inquire

about an employee. After they pro-

duced FBI identification for my father and me, they inquired

about Bruce Bloj--and I believe one other employee. I.

wanted to know the purpose of their inguiry; their response

was vague. They asked what kind of employee Bruce was,

and, after I again asked what the investigation was all

about, indicated that Bruce--and this other employee--were

members of a political party the FBI was interested in.

My father at this point wanted to know if this meant

that his employees were members of the Connunist Party,

that they were "reds." One of the agents responded by

saying he couldn't go into that. My father reacted by

expressing his desixe to fire both of these people.

By now the exchange between my father and one of

the FBI agents had become heated. I interrupted, said that

I thought my father was not thinking clearly, that there

would be no irrings that das., and that I deeply resented

HH 54980

DocId:32989727 Page 102

---

## Page 103

- 2

4220

the impression that the ayents were creating about Bloy

and our other employee by iefusing to answer our questions

while at the same time indicating by inference that the

investigation had to do with their political affiliations.

Clearly: any reasonabla person would conclude that there

must be sonething inacceptable, uidesirable, or illegal

abont my employees conduct.

I tola the FiI agents that these employees were

desirable ones fion my standpoint, that they had never given

me calise to beliere otherwise, and that until such time

as they did, Bruce and the other person could remain with

my company.

I said further that as an employer, I had no interest

in the political belies of my employees, and felt that

the FBI had no. right to raise such things at an individual's

place of employ.

However regrettable my father's response to these

FBI questions, it is exactly the sort of response that can

he expected from employers approached in this manner by

IBI Agents--and I told the agents as much.

I would characterize the approach of the agents

as presumptive, mysterious, and in this instance aggressive.

What was most distressing to me, was the presumption on the

agents' part that we would necessarily share their point

of view.

HH 54980 DocId: 32989727 Page 103

## Page 104

4221

I would like to be specific with respect to.

Bruce Bloy and the other employee (who remains nameless

out of respect for her privacy).. May I state emphatically

that I viewed them both as desirable employees with good

work habits, and I would be pleased to re-employ them a:

any time. It is in my view something more than

regrettable that these two people should be

subjected to

such embarrassment, for what third parties suspect they

might do, rather than what they have actually done.

Thank you, Mir. Chairman.

I count it as a disti

privilege to appear before

today and to

answer any questions which vill help you in your difficult and important task.

My name is Marcus G. Raskin. I am Co-Director of the Institute for

Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. I am a graduate of the University of Chicago

and its Taw School. I have served in the United States government for five

years as an advisor to a group of Congressmen and then as a member of the

Special Staff of the National Security Council under President Kennedy. -I-

also served as a member of the. Presidential Panel on Educational Research and

• Development and an education advisor in the Bureau of the Budget. I have

written half a dozen books in the area of foreign and national security policy,

political philosophy and politics, as well as numerous articles which have

appeared in scholarly jousnals, newspapers and magazines.

Since 1963 I have served as the Co-Diréctor of the Institute for Policy

Studies with Richard I. Barnet, a leading scholar in foreign and economic affairs.

In 1963 the Institute. for Policy Studies was established as an independent

center of research and education in public policy.. Its mandate was to pursue

inquiry and truth about those mattèrs which were central to a free and democratic

society.. The Institute grew out of a belief that the great universities were

too closely identified with ongoing policies of the federal government in the

area of public policy. We believed that it was necessary to develop an institution

which would be financially independent of the government. Consequently, the

Institute does not accept government contracts and grants.

We also believe that

the major questions of our time are moral and political ones. Those of us tho

_in the government found that the fundamental questions about policies were

irtually never asked. Thus, moral questions, or even questions about consequences,

were almost never addressed.

The emphasis was on "getting it done" without

much concern with what the "it"' was. I might add that this unwillingness in

government, difficult in all cases, to ask fundamental moral and political

questions. culminated in the Nixon period of government, although as you are

avare, the seeds of the Nixon era have been present in American government

for many years.

Since 1963, fellows of the Insi.. ute have published books, studies, reports

and articles on a wide variety of issues and quastions. These studies include

analysis of the

university system, the media, health care, the defense system,

military budget, education, multinational corporations, political theory, problems

of econonics, bureaucratic-aecountability, problems of religion the neighborhood,

as well as worker dissatisfaction and participation in the decisions of the work

place. Books by Institute fellows are used in many universities. As you might

have guessed from the subject matter. considered, Institute fellows have been

trained in

various disciplines. They have received their degrees in law,

economics, physics, psychology, sociology, history and political science.

•We have also been

fortunate in developing a PhD program in conjunction with

the Union Graduate School. Seminars and tas!: force discussions are held at the

Institute.. Membership in such study groups usually includes members

from

the government, the Congress, educators from universities, people from the

different citizen's movements which

developed over the last decade, and

fellows of the Institute. These sessions are open and informal, indeed too

informal, as recent revelations suggest. In this regard, Institute fellows

see themselves as as practicing public scholarship. They are "scholars of the

people", available to any and all for discussion. They are not on contract

to any group or corporation, In this basic sense they are independent of party.

From time to time, following the principles of the best social science, the

Institute has undertaken certain social invantions and projects. For example;

we have begun and studied.

such social inventions as mini-schools, new towns

for people leaving agricultural life as tenant farmers, neighborhood science

"laboratories and community technology labs. He have helped communities begin

neighborhood governments.

Recently ve have initiated a clearing house of policy

alternatives for people interested in local and state governments.

During this last thirteen year period where so many values have been.

questioned, and where authority has been seen to be unwise and insensitive,

People have reacted through the development of movements which they hoped

would make real the ideals of American civilization. Movements concerning

civil rights, worker participation, ecology, anti-war, consurerism, and wonen'

liberation shaped and reflected a new consciousness on American life. These

impulses

set the tersm of what equality, freedom and democracy should be.

•We at the Institute attempted to relate our intellectual studies to this

new consciousness. Ohe reason was that people at the Institute balieve that

there was a congruence of the high ideals of these movements to those qualities

necessary to make this society a decent and humane one. This point of view

was not shared by the various police and intelligence agencies of the government

who feared public scholarship and the kind of scholarship which gave information

to anyone who cared to listen or read. For our troubles we have found ourselves

harrassed, bugged, tailed, broken-into, eavesdropped, wiretapped and burgled.

We know the following, but I am sure that now you know much nore.

Every agency which has responded to FOIA requests: the FBI, the CIA,

the Office of Naval Intelligence, Arny Intelligence - have indicated that they

have files on IPS and its fellows.

: Reliable testimony indicated that:

I) The "special services" squad of IRS, the Service's political"

"hit" squad, collected information on IPS in a special room of the IRS: Ihe

IPS tax status underwent special audit for about six years. A spurious challenge

to this status was finally made; it was overruled upon appeal within the IRS

In 1974, as the Watergate scandal began to unravel the Nixon Administration's

plans to quash domestic discussion.

Testimony before House Intelligence Committee

2) The FBI targeted informers to infiltrate and report upon IPS

meetings and seminars. Informers also attempted to gain unemployment at

IPS, but without success. The bureau also rifled IPS garbage, reviewing papers

involved, reconstructing typewriter tapes which were thrown out, and presumably

dispensing with the coffee grounds, tissue papers, paper towels, and other garbage

generally thrown o't each day. The Bureau files on the Institute and its

fellows run to several feet of papers already, and only the barest minimum

have been revealed.

3) IPS fellows were targets of the Boston grand jury investigation

of the Pentagon Papers, an investigation which never resulted in indictments.

Several had supoenas issued against them, but these were dropped rather than

reveal tapes of converations which had been overheard on warantless wiretpes.

4) It is clear that IPS fellows have had their conversations intercepted

by many varrartless -wirctaps, although it is not yet known on whom the taps were

placed. It is clear that the IPS files varu created by each of_the federal

agencies: the CIA, the F3I, the Office of Naval Intelligence, military intelligence

agencies in general. It is not known if IPS or its fellows were targets of the

special "vatch lists" which were distributed to various intelligence agencies,

including NSA, the FRI, CIA, IRS, and military intelligence, but it rould be

surprising if it ware not. The Institute, Richard Barnet and I were on President

Nixon's Enenies list. And various IPS trustees were given special auditing

treatment

5) As if federal attention vere not sufficient, IPS came to the

attention of the DC Police and their political intelligence unit. The DC

police employed the same inforner used by the FBI against IPS, and perhaps several

others.. Several mysterious break-ins took place at IPs over a course of two

years.

The powerful and the state are never very comfortable with open scholarship

and with the willingness to pursue questions whose answers may not serve the status

¡quo. This problem is one

goes with

the territory fo

he public scholat,

the scholar for the people. Ideas are indeed frightening things.. They cannot be

seen, but they can be felt, they represent the accumulated wisdom of people,

and yet they seem ivory towered and remote; they challenge the status quo and

undermine the powerful, but they can be tested and evaluated publicly and

honestly. This can be done through debate, not through wiretapping or burglary.

It can be done not through imprisonment, indictrent; impugning the patriotism

or honesty. Of another person, but by stating directly one's interests, arguments

and purposes. The value of this hearing is that it will encourage the police

-agencies to think again about who they are and what they serve. It might even

encourage them to come to discussions of the Institute not as spies, sneaks

• and informers, but as participants who are open to having their dearest assumptions

challenged,

Mr. Martagh. I am

sorry:. I didn', hear the question.

Mio Balluns. Has the Eat, tended, over the years, to

sareen out certain racial groups and roligious groups?

Mr. Murkagh. Racial and religious groups. i don't

understand that you nean by, screen out.. In hising?

Mr. Dellams, Tes.

1. Burtogh, There is no question about it, that the

selection process has been designed in such a way inat a per

son could not be hired in an agent capacity unless he could get

by an interview wich a person who was already in the position

of, says ar

SAC and the screening has bean done along the

Ines of if you lock the part.. if you are the type of person

that I am, then we will

take your and if you are not, we

won't.

I have versonal experience in a situazion where an

11. Force captain was coming. into the Bureau I mean was

asking for employment and the assistant in charge in Atlanta

called me in. I had been assisting in screening some of these

people. He asked me so go qui

and take a look at this fellow,

and i wont out and looked at pin and i went back in and he

said, "Do you see anything wrong wich him?" I said, "No, I

can't see anything wrong."

He said, "Didn't you notice thac he has eyes like Robart

Now, lc, Adame hers this nozning was mentioning that they

were having trouble reomicing minority agents. I happaned to

recruited then very vigorously.

and he says, "if you don't

stop it, you are going to get those niggers hack down south

2E. Deliums. Thank you, Mi. Murtagh. My next question

Is, does the FBI have a political philosophy, and, if so, does

the agency's polisical views affect its invescigacion of

Blacks, browns, suds; tallows, Sociallst Workers Party,

anti"ar novement and ocher so-called dissident groups?

Ir. Muztagh. The emphasie, on all. the intelligence investi

gation is to hit the left hari and to ignore the right uncil

they do enough damage as they did in she sixties in the Klan

sicuation, to do enough damage so that the Bureau is forced

Into investigating by the press....

early sixties and the Bureay at that tine - the Brown deci

sion cane down in 1954 and bs. 1962 they had nothing on the Klan

in Alabana other than a list of first nanes and that sori of

thing, no penetration whatsoever, and if you contrast that

with the intensive investigations that they made of the Black

midwestern senator who was in a hitand-run accident situacion.

He told us this in a class, with fifty agents present here

in Washingion on the weel that Kennedy was killed.

Mir. Johnson. Was that used by the FBI in operacion

him, "What do we use all this memorandum stuff va pui la about

He said, "The other

night we picked up a sicuation where this Senator was seen

drunk, in a hit-and-sun accident, and ecle goodlooking bread

was

in memorandum", and Datoach. and this is an exact quote

he said, "By noon the texc day the good. Senator was

I Just wonder, I have no quarrel with informers,

but how do you keep informers from beconing provocateurs, and

did you have knowledge of any provocateurs when you were in

the FIT?

Mr. Muccagn. I spoke to Mr. Hardy this morning when the

question of provocateurs came up and said it is my judgment

that the sicuacion that he cold von cboac is probably a rarity

in the Bureau. I think that, is was acobably. the accions of

an indiridual agent.

The Burean, to my knoledge, never indicated they wanted

you to develop a provocateur, buce of, course, it in aleo my

feeling that chis unbalanced policical membersity of agents,

that is, the fact that they are all rightringers racher than

having a libaral here and there, this creates an abnosphere

in which provocazzure develor...

If you were in the bureau and you were a radisc, you

vere s strong supporter of the Viet Man War; you hated all the

minority groups; you could be very popular, because most of the

agents felt that way.

Ic. Lehuan-

That was a

There were some questions which Congressaan Delluns posed

I have at my fingertips was as the result of a survey made in

bez has been reduced since that time.

some three yeare ago, that, number was over 1,200. The

Mr. Wannail. There was one stacenent made by Miss Lori

Paton this altarnoon that I would like to comment upon.

There is litigation Invoiving Miss Paton at the present time,

also, so I do not want to go extensivey into it, but she did

make a scatement that when she wrote su the Director of the

FBI to inquire as to whether tere was an FBI investigation of

hes, she received a reply in the negative, and I am auze that

1s the case.

.. .

she has explained there were, three contacts which were

made, and I think this noming. it was pointed out that it took

us six nonths really to get arcund to doing this, buù three

contacts that were made and establiched chai she was a high-

school scudent and in connection with i civics class, I think

1é was, bad prepared and sent a lectes.

When that information was developud, it was considered by

our fiold office as completely insignificant, not of suffi-

cient significance to send to headguarters, so when Miss

• Paton

wrote to headquariers and made this inquiry, we had absolutely

no secorê in the files of our headquarters division wich

respact to Miss Paton, and that was, the basis for her having

received the reply which she aid...

Thank you, Mx. Chairman.. I, did vant to make these few

remarks; and it I an able to reply to masters of a policy or

procedure nature, I would certainly be nost happy to attempi

to.

In a high school class wrote so a political party and, as a

result, got investigaied by the PBI., That is really what it

boils dera se.

Then when she found she was being investigated by the fBI,

she coce to the Fix and asiced shem whether she was being in-

Nor, I don't really thins that you van avoto responsi

Agent in Charge, and flatly denied that there was any

investigation by the Bureau. That didn't come fron Washington;

that come from the Regional Office and from the man who

purported or alleged that he was in charge of the investigation

Ne. Hannall. I an not familiar with the letter, but

I was basing my remarks

Chaisman Pike. I don't kapu whether sha said the

Mr. Wannall. Then I-took my notes down incorrecily,

Mx. Chairman,

• Chaisman Pike, It is possible that you are right.

But the man in charge, I. Nallace Laprade, is a real name,

he was the one in charge of this and here is che language

of the letter: "After carefully reviewing the faces in this

matter, I have concluded therwas no impropriety on the part

of investigative personnel of this bureau and that the FBI

Paton is not the subject of an investication by this Bureau

and that the FBi doas not maintain a general policy of surveil

lance of correspondence of political groups such as the

SocialisE Labor Party."

We are now talking about the socialist Labor Parcy

opposed. to the Socialist Workers Party. But other chan

thak, it seems to me a rather straightforward mis assertion

of the faces as chey actually were.

Mr. Wannali. Mc. Chairman, I will be rory hapey to pursue

want to know is how many wanted to resion or how many requested

to resign. Would you furnish us wich chac information for che

last two or three years so we vill know how many are resigning

in disgust or war?

Mr. Wannall. Ne. Moclory, the best way i can ansver

that is to tell

you that the turnover rate anong agents,

if you exclude those who retire, is less than 3. percent.

Mr. MoClory, With respect to informants, thar is a

legitimate and very vital way of securing infoznation

and intelligence, isn't 1t?

Me. Wannaid:

JeB, Sit.

You aze not going to discontinue that

because ve have some intelligence excessas or failures or abuses,

I hope.

Now also, Mir. Hurragh, of course, came to work fos you

In 1951. That vas before the Civil Rights Act of °64 and before

the Voting Rights Act of '65.

We have had & chunge, have ve not, during these later

years with respect o rights of minorities, espocially the

that and they have been reflected in the FBI as wall as in

a party chas follows the doctrine of Marxism leninisn as inter

preted by leon Trotsky.

Hi. McClory. How about she Insticute of policy Scudies,

do they advocate any violent overchrow de che Government?

Me. NoClors. Do they pose some threat to the united

Me. Wannall. I think our inveacigation principally

was based on the individuals who were involved in the

Mr. Hayes, The feeling that I get is chai somehow i am

I didn': really realize that anybody was still cramping

around discussing at the kind of level chat has been discussed

today and in the testimony particularly, the ideological

postuzings of groups in America. I think it is really quite

strange and to me quite disturbing. i want to simply comment

on some views that were placed in the record by Mr. McClory,

particularly, some views I think probably ought co be taken

into account considering the testimony we have had here

this morning and considesing sone of the explanations

that you have given.

The question of how long wa should stay witi an

investigation of someone is answered, I think, basically

by the EBT. and the other

Party modern structure.

You stated or inferred

that Mr. Trotsiy advocated the

Do you think it is justified that the Goverment should ever

Mr. Wannali, By a section in the Criminal Division which

of course is under the Attorney General:

Mr. Johnson. Yas, has anybody lue Congrese ever said

"Why are you doing

activities against so-called dissent groups

in this country?

Mr. Wannall. The entire natter relating to the so-called

COINTELPRO has boes reviewed and is under consideration

in the Civil Righes Division of the Derariment of justice.

We icol: our entire file

on the COIraL RO and made it available

to the Assistant Actorney Ceneral and two of his deputies to

review the metor. While it was not possible for him to 100k

at every serial, he did lous at all socials and in fact Mr.

Ryan, who is'at the cable wich me, tried is direct his

attention to spacific itens that might ba croablesome.

Following the revier, he said based on his revier there

was no indication of a violation o the statute. he dia say

that lã any infornation iscalled to hid attention in the future,

he certainly would consider it.

Mi, bellume, You indicated in cestimony this morning that

you no longer have a security index file. You have an ADEX

Ele, does the FBI still maintain at some locacion cards

which have nanes of 13,900 porsong who were on this

security indes?

My point is: Yousy you don't have it, but don'c you in

fact still have those names and you can call then forward

ac any time?

Iz. Wannall. We have cards on 13,000. I will accept

chat figure. I think it is probably in that neighborhood.

When the security index was discontinued by legislation

of this congress in September, of 1971,. we had a program

regularly of destroying cards. They were maintained for

a cercas

period of time and then destroyed. However, Senator Mansfield

issued instruccions in January of this year that no

records should be destroyed pending the outcome of the investi-

gations by the Senate Commitcoe.

We have made no destruction

of any records since that time.

Chairman Pike, The time of the gentlenan has expired.

First, I would like to cleas up for the record the

colloquy you had with the Chalrman concerning)this lori Paton

words of the statement were: "I was shocked

when FBI Dizector

IaPrade wrote back denying I had been the subject of

Mr. Milford.

Mr. Wannall, on the sucface it would seen

that several witnesses have appeared before this committee

and have given some very disturbing testinany agains. the

rEI.

Soms of these accucations and aliegations are very

serious.

Under our system of justice whether in our couscs os

before our jules os even in Congressional investigations

there exists the right of rebuctal by the accused or maligned.

Without a doubt the FBI has been ascused os some serious

aberracion and violations of our laws. there are actually

two hearings going on here today.

One is the official hearing being conducted by this

conmittee on behalf of the House of Representatives. The

other is a public hearing chat in effest is a form of trial

by television and socociety by newspapers.

With lictle doubt tonight's television and comorcow's

newspapers will decail the sensacional statements made by the

witnesaes that appeared before this committee coday.

Unlike our legal system of justice the props in hoc

required to plod through painstaking investigations to assuse

that all legitinate facts are. known and presented to the jury

oi: to the public.

They are legally free to print or broadcast any icem

of infomation as long as someone will simoly say it,

particulacly if lt conveniently fitg a one-minute IV blurb or

quoten are sensational, controversial or scandalous.

while the FBI is probably going to flunk out as a TV

star in tonight's news or as a celebriy in conorrow's news-

I think it is entremely important for this committee's

record to have the enmolece and detailed information concerning

the allegations

and accusations that have been made by witnesses

befose us today.

You have rebutted portions of thai testimony. Mr. Wannall

I realise chat you may not be able to fully comment on each

and every allegation thai has been mado today. The time

remaining for this committee to finish its investigation will

probably not allow us to call you or ocher FBI octicials back

before the commiucee in dormal hearingu.

take the

statements ofteach and every witness that have

Ns. Dellums.

Yes

ME. Wannall.

Not to my knowledge.

No. Dellume. That was che justification?

Ms. Wannall.

I think I previously stated that the act

*i investigacion, to the best of my recallection, was opened

in 1968 based upon contacts with an organization unich was

then nown as Students for Denocratic Society...

Ms. Delluns. Do you have documentation that indicates

that your records will show that there were contacts with the

Weatherment You montioned that very specifleally.

Mi. Wannall, We have infosmation that there were, as I

recall, contacts with at least two Weathermen, yes, six.

Mr. Dellums. Would you supply that to this committee,

please? -

Ni. Field, Mr. Wannall, do agents of the FBI rummage.

chrough people's trash in order to collect intelligence, sor

called trash covers?

hir. Wandali. I tiins thore have been isolated incidents

where that nas been done.

The policy ot the FBI since the

middle of 1966 has been aot to condot so-called trash covers.

Mx. Field. Since 1966 that has been their policy and

did you testify under oath before our comitiee that since

cher to your knowledge thai has not been done?

Mi. Wannali. I did so testily. I have since leamed

of one occasion where trash which was discarded by an organi-

zation was in fact recovered by an agent. It was not done

with paloz knowledge of fBI headquarters.

Ric. Field. Is. Wannall, is it a policy oi the FbI to

report on sonebody's

seczat. life if it has no relevance to the

jnvestigation?

Ms. Wannall. No, sir.

ME. Field. In other words, they would not report on ic?

Mix. Wannall. No,

SiT.

Mr. Field. Mi. Wannall, are you aware of the nemo of

Augusi: 29, 1972 - and I will read from it since it is not

classified - saying, "On August 2318. last, Special Agent

Mr. Wannall. I think it is a matter of the way the agent

sets it up in the report.

Mr. Field, Are you aware in the course of rummaging

througs the trash your special

- agent came across a typewaiter

ribbon whinh the FBI reconstituted and it contained a letter

exclusively involving the sex life of some employees of the

Institute of Policy Scudies?

Are you aware of that letter

and was that letter kept in

Ji it had no relevance to the case.

Did this person's

ser autivities have any relation to this case?

Ne. Wannall. What is this document, Me. Field? I don'e

have the first page.

Mr. Field. I believe thai is all that was provided to

the committee when we received the docimants from the FBI.

Mr- Wannali. This is not in the form of a documeni

prepazed for dissemination. in fact is is a mamorandum from

the agent to his superviso: in the washington field office

setting forth the sesuits of the so-called trasi cover in

this instance.

At least that is that it appears to me io be.

Ni. Field. That is correct. In osher words, ic is not

Why would this information make ic througn the analysis

Mr. Field. I took that to nean i: obviously could be

collected in raw form but it would not be isported further

inless it had sone relevance to the investigation.

We now see a mens in which sone ajent has analyzed chis

infoxmation, has included

excerpts fron it and avery single

excerpt pertains only to sexual intormation.

Is that a correci analysis of that memo?

Ms. Wannall. I have not read it. Do you want me to

never seen this msno before?

M5. Wannall. No, 3i2.

Chairman Pike. I thinl: what Mi. Field is trying to puc

forth is that it certainly doesn't seem to comply with what

you have stated your policy to be and i think that sacher

than ask you to read it at this time and analyze it, we will

drop that.

Mr. Field, Thank you, Mr. Chairman. i have no further

questions.

given me different information.

Can I just a5i: mue question before ve adjour?

Chairman Pike. You may ast one question before we adjourn

Nic. Dallung.

whank you,

In response to my question, wasn't the real reason for

the IPS invescigation their relationshly with ramparts

Magaxine" your response was ao, it was primarily concerned

with eDS.

Now the ataif has provided ne with information that says

that ino initial menorandun which is dated Novenber 1968 fcom

your office dealing with ips, was exclusively devoted to

"Ramparts Maganine" and that it wasn't until a venorandur

written ia March of 1969 that there wasay reference to SDS

and that chere is in faci no evidence pi Sp$ concacts wlih

Now that contradicts your testimony before we leave and

I wanted to give you an opporcunity to address that.
