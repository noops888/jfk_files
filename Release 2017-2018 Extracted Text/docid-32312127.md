CONFIL

NOTE CONTINUED:

audiences both in the U.s. and abroad in an attempt to convince

Bureau and other Government agencies

conspired to cover up the

true facts concerning the assassination.

More recently, he has

associated with Huey Newton of the BPP and various leaders of

the New Left.

Within the last year he has been closely associated

with Jane Fonda and has, along with her, been a leading antiwar

activist. The most recent

information received concerning him

indicated that he was in Paris, France, in 3/71, where he made

a number of contacts with! Vietnamese, revolutionary organizations,

and individuals of the Far Left including Alan Krivine, leader

of the Communist league and with a member of the Fourth Inter-

national European Trotskyists organization] He travels widely

and his residence has been unknown for sometime.

In order to

establish a logical office

of origin in this case and to there-

after consider him for inclusion on the SI, it is desirable that

his permanent residence be established.
