IDENTIFYING DATA

Subject is a forty year uld married male who is a citizes of Cuba.

He has been cooperating with the Agency since about 1959, without receiv-

ing salary and being paid only expenses incurred in operational assignments.

Subject has been residiag in the United States since March 1961, Subject is

being utilized in a covert capacity as an Fl assel, Subject's file number in

201-211900.

PROCEDURE

03

Subject was given a polygraph interview at the request of Harry WEBSTER.)

case officer, WH/C/FI. The interview was held at a covert site in Washington,

D. C. on 27 August 1965. The interview was conducted in the English lang

-uage, in which Subject appeary to have limited and seemingly adequate pro-

ficiency Subject sometimes expressed difficulty in understanding certain

words or phraseology in revicwing test questions, but generally stated that

he understood definitions and meanings for testing purposes.

Throughout

testing, Subject claimed that he understood the test questions; during a

discussion at the end of the interview, Subject stated that he found himself

during tests translating the interrogator's questions into Spanish for himself

and then providing his answers, ever though he had heard the questions before ...

testing and had arrived at a judgment on them.

PURPOSE

It was requested by the case officer that polygraph testing attempt to

determine the following: (l) Any connection with another intelligence service,

-especially Cuban; (2) Whether Subject has told the truth about the nature of

his relationship with Rolando CUBELA and has been reporting the truth to us

¿bout CUBELA and CUBELA's activities; (3) Whether Subject has told the

truth about his relationship with CARRILLO, Cuban Ambassador in Paris.

In addition, it was requested that testing include the specific issues requestec

for coverage in an attachment io a contact report dated 28 June 1965.

These

issues include Subject's true name, Communist connections, intelligence or

security connections, relationships with CUBELA and CARRILLO, report;

ing of Agency assignments and CUBELA activities, smuggling or illegal

activities in the United States or Europe, disclosure of CIA connection to

any intelligence service or to the Castro Government. It was suggested

that the smuggling issue not be included or stressed during current testing,

and that it should be pressed if there was any indication that Subject might

be vulnerable to blackmail or might be using his CLA connection primarily

to protect or irivance his own business purposes. The issue was not entered

into during testing. It was agreed that merely an emotional question using

the word "smuggling"" be inserted to draw out Subject's comments or work

• as an indicator or later a wedge into any illegal activities or exploitation

of CIA on the part of the Subject. Il is noted that such a question was

reserved until the very last test administered to the Subject so that there

would be no risk of emotionally disturbing the Subject prematurely or

clouding the relevant intelligence issues.

CONCLUSION•

From a technical analysis, Subject's charts exhibit a combination

of nervous tension,

'erratic patterns, reactions, and inconsistencies through

out three separate phases of testing. The charts also show a marked increase

in emotional disturbance and tension and progressively worse reactions as

testing advanced.

From the standpoint of Subject'y tension and sensitivity,

it is possible that Subject is practicing deception during testing and that his

unusual test performance is the result of attempts to withhold pertinent

information in one or more relevant areas. Overall testing could not

conclusively pinpoint the reactions on all questions pertiennt as deception

reactions, and Subject's reactions are unresolved it this point.

Due to

certain other factors which may have influenced testing, it is necessary to term

this case inconclusive and incomplete. To resolve the factors, it is recom

mended that Subject be re-interviewed at a later date and that the interview

be conducted in the Spanish language.

It is believed that only testing in

Spanish can conclusively confirm or eliminate any indications and significant

problem areas arising from current tests. In the meantime, Subject's

The factors present during this interview that might have affected

technical testing are as follows: •

(1) Subject claimed to be sick, to have been feeling ill since the pre-

vious evening and to have debated with himself whether to fly to

Washington for the interview that same morning:

(2) Subject claimed to be "in a hurry" because of "business problems"

and stipulated that the interview should not take too long so that

he could catch an early plane back to New York;

Subject has a rather limited command of the English language and

there are indications that a language problem may have been en-

countered during testing.

On the basis of these factors, Subject has been temporarily given the

benefit of the doubt in testing, but by no means has been given a clean bill

of health on the basis of current test performance; inasmuch as the case is

considered incomplete, arrangements should be made for a jollow-up poly-

graph interview in the Spanish language at a later date.

DETAILS

1 Specifically, Subject did not reflect consistent reactions on the

general question of working for another intelligence service, but he did reflect

reactions on specific questions of having a secret connection with the Castro

Government, telling another intelligence service about his connection with us,

having a secret connection with any Cuban Intelligence or security organization,

reporting information about American Intelligence activities or representatives

to anyone unknown to us, giving lalse or misleading information to any American

Intelligence representative, and being approached to work for another intelligeace

there was anyone he hid told who should rot krow ahoul his connection or whom

Subject said that he assumed that Cuban Welligence may have found out.or

guessed about his relationship with us, but thai he had not told them himself,

He also stated that he felt that the people he had told were known to us. The

pertinent question was changed accordingly to, "Have you told anyone we do

net know about about your connection with American Intelligeace?" Subject

stated that he could answer in the negative on the question in this form. During

testing, Subjeci ritlected reactions on the question. (Writer"s Commeat: It

to provide names and deiails to the case officer later in a more lengthy meeting)

3. During later tests which included specific questions on whether Subject

had told any intelligence service, the Casiro Government, or CARIULLO about

his connertion with us, Subject ilso reflected strong reactions on these questions

and was interrogated. Subject donied having revciled his conneccion to any of

these sources.

4. Subject was interrogated on tie basis of pronounced reactions on

the question, "Have you ever deliberately reported false or misleading in-

formation to any American Intelligence representative?" Subject 'stated that

he had never reported false or misleading information on any assignment or

task, including his missions to Mexico and Switzerland, and concerning his

5. Subject stated that he had nos been approached to work for any other

intelligence service besides American, despite reactions on this question.

6. Regarding his name, Subject stated that he has used the name Carlo

TEPEDINO Gonzalez since 1946. Before 1946, he used the name Carlos LOPEZ

his true name from birth. During testing, there were no reactions to questions

covering these two facts, but there were reactions on the question, "Have you

ever used another name to hide your true identity?" Answer: "No." Subject

stated that he had never used any name io hide his true identity and that he

understood the meaning of the question to refer to any secret or intelligence

use of another name that was unknown to us.

7. Subject reacted prominently on various questions dealing with CUBELA.

During the pre-test discussion, the interrogator had asked the Subject the follow

ing question:. Does CUBELA have a plan to overthrow Castro? Subject replied

that there is no plan that he knows of, and he does not consider CUBELA's various

activities as constituting a plan for such an objective. Asked how he might des-

cribe CUBELA's attitude toward Castro, Subject said that CUBELA was opposed

to the Castro government and that Subject felt that CUBELA had a "desire" to

overthrow Castro, rather than any plar. When Subject was asked whether he

considered CUBELA's group to be a genuine anti-Castro and anti- Communist

group, Subject replied that CUBELA did not have a group and that he knew of no

group he ever had. Asked how he would describe any individuals who supported.

CUBELA as friends, or promised him support in any undertaking, or who might

be counted on for support if he were ever to follow through with his "desire" to

ovurthrow Castro, Subject shrugged and said he did not know what to call them,

that he did not think CUBELA had any control over all his friends or supporters,

that he did not even think they would all help CUBELA in any crisis or that CUBELA

could depend on any of them in any uncertaking. He said that a group as such was

no.'-exisient and that he could not eves regard CUBELA's following as a group of

friends, an organization of any kind, a social circle, a band oi sympath-

izers, etc. Subject also stated thut he had complete confidence in CUBELA

and would trust him in whatever he did.

During testing, Subjict reacted on the question regarding CUBELA's

desire to overthrow Castro. Subject stated during interrogation that he had

no doubt at all regarding CUBELA's desire to overthrow Castro and he could

not understand the reason for his reaction on such a question. Subject re-

peuted that he had complete confidence in CUBELA.

Subject was also interrogated on his reactions on the question, "Do you

believe that CUBELA is anti-Castro and anti- Communist?" Answer: "Yes."

Subject said that in his opinion, CUBELA was against the, Castro government,

but that he felt that CUBELA admired Castro.

He said that in spite of CUBELA's

strong admiration for Castro, CUBELA was still opposed to him and to his

methods.

8. During discussion of questions before testing, Subject was asked

the question, "Does CUBELA have any connection with Cuban Intelligence

or Cuban Sccurity?" Subject réplied, "Yes." Asked to explain, Subject stated

that CUBELA definitely had an "inside track" with Cuban intelligence and Bec

urity clements, knew quite a few intelligence people, worked with them closely,

had daily contacts with them, knew what was going on in intelligence circles,

etc. Subject was asked whether he meant that CUBELA was working for or

cooperating with Cuban Intelligence or Security clements. Subject replied that

CUBELA, of course, had strong connections with Cuban Intelligence and was

probably cooperating with them in various ways. Subject added that he had

to in order to gain their confidence and to be able to know what Cuban Intelli-

gence was doing. He also added that even though he had these connections,

he was still opposed to the Castro Government and would probably take an

opportunity to work against it. Subject said that CUBELA would not be able

to exist in Cuba is he dous today if he did not have the confidence of the Castro

Government and intelligence services. Subject was asked how he knew so well

about CUBELA's connections with Cuban Intelligence; Subject replied that CUB.

CLA had told'everyone and had told me' and "everyone knew about CUBELA'.

contacts with Cuban Intelligence."

Subject was advised that the question would not be asked as proposed,

and was asked what his answer would be to the following question, "Is CUBELA

an agent vi Cuban Intelligence or Cuban Security?" Scuject said that he would

auswer, "No." During testing, Subject reflected reactions, on the question.

9. Subject suflected reactions during tests on the question, "Hive you

told us the complete truth about your relationship with CUBELA?" and "Have

you deliberately attempted to hide or keeep secret from us any information

about Rolando CUBELA?" Subject did not show reactions on the question,

"Have you told us the complete truth about your relationship with CARRILLO?",

but he did show reactions on the question, "Have you told CARRILLO about

jour connection with American Intelligence?" Answer: "Nu." Subject was

interrogated on the basis of the reactions, but furnished no pertinent inform-

ation. Subject insisted that he had not told CARRILLO about his connection

with us, and that he had told us cverything about his relationship with CUBELA.

Subject stated that he considered CUBELA his friend, but he could not classify

CARRILLO as a friend. Subject was asked whether CARRILLO was friendly, to the

Subject and whether they were both on amicable terms, and Subject replied

that these statements wen true.

10. In a final test, the following questions were asked;

American Intelligence? No.

Is there anything important in your background that you have not told

Arc you an agent of the Castro Government? No.

Does CUBELA have coptacts with Cuban Intelligence? Ye&.

Is CUBELA an agent of Cuban Intelligence? No..

Have you told us the complite truth about your relationship with CUBELA?

Yes.

Have you ever been asked to work for any intelligence service besides us?

No,

Have you ever worked for or cooperated with any intelligence service

besides American? No.

During two final tests including thest questions,

Subject reacted pro-

minently but inconsistently on most questions, and exhibited overall emotional

disturbance throughout the tests.

An additional question which had been in-

cluded, "Is there a CUBELA group?" was not answered by the Subject during

testing. Before testing Subject had stated that he understoon the question and

had agreed to answer No to the question according to discussions on the topic.

Later, Subject explained that he could not answer the question. The question

was followed up by, "Does CUBELA have many friends who support him against

Castro?" on which Subject answered Yes, according to agreement.

Regarding

the smuggling question, Subject appeared quite concerned and asked for an explanatio

of the question three times, whereupon he indicated that he understood the quest

ion perfectly. There was only a slight disturbance on the question during test

ing which did not appear significant to the interrogator. Subject was not inter?

ogated on this question or asked any questions about smuggling.

11, During va-ious post-iest discussion periods, Subject was asked whether

he undersiood the questions asked or whuther he had experienced any difficulties

in comprenunsion during testing. Subject generally relorted that he understood

the questions and knew just what they meant; in addition, Subject would sometimes

put the questions into his own oversimplified expressions to indicate that he

understood the meanings. Questions on which Subject expressed difficulty

in comprehending were explained and re-phrased prior to testing. During later

discussions, Subject stated that he found himsen at

mentally changing the questions asked into Spanish and then answering thems

even though he was aware of the question and his answet prior to testing.

There did not seem to be an divious language difficulty during test preparation

with the Subject, however, Subject's command of English can not be rated as.

fluent or even proficient.

It is also possible that Subject might have been

attempting to do more than his language ability permitted or failing to recog-

nize a truelanguage or semantics problem in the test procedure.
