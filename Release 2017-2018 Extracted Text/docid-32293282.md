Re Atlanta airtel to NY, 2/13/61 and NY teletype

to the Director, 3/3/61.

Subject, born ANTONINA ANGELINA BERNADETTE BUFALINO,

6/22/31, Detroit, Michigan, Of BLANCHE and CHARLES BUFALINO,

both deceased.

Subject advised that she is the niece of

RUSSELL, BUFALINO, who is a top hoodlum figure.

Subject is

a cousin wILLIAM BUFALINO, a Detroit attorney for JAMES

HOFFA'S

Teamsters Union.

Subject confidentially advised that she obtained

the following information concerning the 2/16/59 robbery

•of ALEXANDER GUTERMA In NYC from her close friendship with

JEANNE FOLI, 572-A 17th Street, Brooklyn, NY. JEANNE

dated AL CIMEl while subject dated PHILIP ARCURI, both,

Brooklyn gamblers. JEANNE worked for ALEXANDER GUTERMA

as a confidential employee and apparently made trips to

and from Canada for him. She was well compensated for this

work and in 1958 bought a brand new pink, 4-door Buick, which

she gave to AL. CIMEI as a present.

On 2/8/59, JEANNE stated that Mrs. 'GUTERMA

had flown in from Las Vegas that day and acted very

excitedly.

. She called Mr. GUTERMA and apparently he

said he would be over later that same night. JEANNE

was in the room when the conversation took place. PHIL

ARCURI stated that he surmised that Mrs. GUTERMA had

apparently brought something very valuable from Las Vegas

to New York and that he was going to get it. ARCURI and

AL CIMEI left and picked up JOSEPH CIMEI, uncle of AL CIMEI.

At 11 o'clock that night, AL CIMEI called JEANNE and they

discussed the contents of a valise and decided that it

contained stock.

Later she learned that JOSEPH CIMEI and

PHILIP ARCURI went to the GUTERMA apartment and gained entrance

and carried out certain valuables.

AL CIMEI waited downstairs

in the pink Buick but because GUTERMA knew him and the Buick,

he became scared and took off. After the robbery, ARCURI and

JOSEPH CIMEI were unable to find AL CIMEI and hailed a

cab, which they rode for a few blocks,

and then they

transferred to another cab, rode another few blocks.

and took a subway.

Subject assumed that they all met

at JOSEPH CIMEI's residence.

After determining that

the valise contained "stock"

, they took the

"stock" and

threw it in Sheepshead Bay.

Subsequently they learned

that the loot was not "stock" but in fact was $500 bills

in Canadian currency. They returned to the spot and

retrieved a wet, broken valise.

The money was in a

paper bag, which they had thrown in the Bay, but they

were unable to locate it.

Among the loot was also over $150,000 in American

currency, which they split three ways. Also in the loot

were jewels which subject believes they peddled through

, owner of the Black Magic Bar, which is

located near 4th Avenue and 3rd Street in Brooklyn. They

were bitter over the paltry amount they received for the

jewels but did nothing about

1t.

Within two months, AL CIMEI and PHIL ARCURI

blew their entire take at local race tracks.

PHIL ARCURI

purchased a new Oldsmobile "88" at Gaynes Oldsmobile Company,

Flatbush, NY, approximately one week after the robbery.

AL CIMEI and PHIL ARCURI Jointly purchased for $5,000 a

pizzeria next door to the Club 18, 18th Avenue and 56th

Street, Brooklyn, NY. Subjedt only vaguely familiar with

JOSEPH CIMEI and does not know what he did with his share

of the loot.

Several days after the robbery, she heard from

PHIL ARCURI that the local precinct, NYCPD precinct

(covering the Club 18 in Brooklyn), received an anonymous

letter stating that AL CIMEI and PHIL ARCURI robbed GUTERMA.

Detectives came to the Club 18 looking for ARCURI and CIMEI.

Subject heard nothing further concerning this matter.
