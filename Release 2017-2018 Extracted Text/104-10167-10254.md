WH/III/A:

FROM

SUBJECT: Pedro Luis DIAZ Lang

The following answers sere given ne by Reichhardt and are keyed

to the questions you wanted asked of him concerning Subjects

1. Did he ever see DIAZ Lans alone?

YES.

2o. Did he see him as often as he wanted to?

YES.

3. Under what circumatances did he see him?

In the INS offices in Miant, both alone and in the presence

• of INS officers.

Lo Was he ever denied access to him?

NO.

50

Did he have a chance to debrief him fully? Could he have

done so?

It was not possible to debrief DIAZ fully for two reasons.

His state of mind while being held in the INS offices in

Miani was not conducive to a proper debriefing; and there

was not enough time to obtain requirements fron Feadquarters.

DIAZ was given a good preliminary debriefing by the FBI

immediately after his arrival, and a thorough debriefing

was possitle only under different circunstances and with

detailed requirements.

There was no denial by INS, other

than as the result of the circunstances, of access to DIAZ,

who theoretically could have been debriefed.
