so as to

avoid any involvement in this slaying. An illness on the

part of the informant could delay the plans to kill Blasi,

but would not eliminate him entirely from any future

planned slaying of Blasi.

Accordingly, it is believed that

parole board called him in and questioned him

concerning his activities and associates with the idea of

revocation of parole, if necessary, that his involvement

in this matter would

be voluntarily terminated by Giancana

and Buccieri. (V)

SAC Johnson believes that he can disseminate

this information concerning the planned murder to State's IllI

the foregoing to the State's Attorney Dan Ward, Cook County,

on a confidential basis and arrange, if possible, for |
