Preliminary Survey:

Due to the inadequacy of the submitted material, only tentative

mummariing statements can be made.

Summarising Statements:

The writer in evidently a, reserved and careful person who

attendo to his affairs in a rather deliberate manner.

He posseses &

good intelligence (not brillant), in well educated and professionally

trained. He has thoroughly absorbed the material he has read and

tudied and knows how to utilise it in a purposeful manner. His way

of thinking de cleas, logical and fairly adaptable. He apparently in

anxlous to learn new things and to wid:n his horizon. He has some

Intellectual ambitions, but the emphasis of his intereste in in the

practical sphere. He does not possess much originality, but he

identifien himself with well-selected patterns which may let him

appear more sophinitcated than le actually is. He discarde unneces-

mary and superfluous material, but he may not discera the vital pointe

la more intricate and unfamiliar problems unless properly pointed our

to him. He in a careful observer of small details which he correlates

properly to their larges aspects within his familiar frame of reference.

He combines a certain amount of Imagination with sober-mindednes

and matter-of-factness. He tries to expedite his work, but he in not

Ilkely to sacrilice accuracy to expediency. His critical faculties are

well developed and he evaluates by rather set standardo. Also, he

in not likely to voice his criticiam openly as he tende to avoid open

controvernies. Within the area of his knowledge and experience, he

can exercise initiative and deal with the overall picture of a projact.

He has nome understanding for mechanical funetioning which may not

be fully trained and exploited. He can figure and calculate and he has

learned to think In larger terms and transactions. He la concervative

In his calculations and le will make every possible effort to get along

with the money and material at his disposal. Secretely, he would like to

opend money freely and play the role of a big shot. He bar some

adainistrative abilities which he can exercise within a limited familiar

In relation to this, he can work out the blueprint of a plan and

prescribed rules and regulations and he will take care that people who

work for him do the same. In the execution of his tasks, he is exact,

conscientious and reliable. He is serious, methodical and systematic

in his approach. He can express himself in an adequate form, verbally

a well as in writing. He is able to present his material in a concise

and understandable manner. He is not likely to say one word more

than would be absolutely necessary, which is one of hin customary

precautions. He is a diligent worker who pursues his aims persist-

ently and who does n? rest until the last item of an asnignment.ia

completed. When necessary, he can mus ter a considerable amount

of patience. His analysing and synthenizing facultien are not particu-

Jarly pronounced, bur he has a way of figuring out the implicationa of

the things he sees and hears and usually he come. to the correct con-

clusions. Being rather unassuming ir his manner, people may, at

times, underestimate his capabilities. He concentrate: well on his

work and at the same sime, takes in everything that'is going on

around him and that could be of special interest to bim. His memory

functions precinely and he can reproduce easily remembered knowledge

and information.

Emotionally, the writer is predominantly an introverted type

who can join required extraverted professional and social activities

without much emotional participation. With the ald of his strong

capacity for identification, he blends in with his environment and

avoids attracting special attention. While he is emotionally not very

mature and individualised, he is fairly well equilibrated, componed

and poised. He has his feelings and impulses under the strictest

rational control and he is not likely to be carried away by them. His

Ego-feelings are much stronger than most people who deal with bim

would suspect.

He in rather confident of himgelf and inwardly may

ever consider himself quite superior to others. There is almost

"some impertinence in his inner attitude which helps him to assert

himself and make his claims known in various indirect ways. He is

not quite as harmless as he may appear and he knows exactly what he

Is after. He proceeds with great carafulnoss and precaution and he

in quite clever in anticipating possible dangera. Hie self-defensive and

self-protective mechanisms are strongly developed and he is most

cecretive about hie affairs. He is not likely to confide completely in

anjbody. Unncticed, he koupa up a strong personal reserve preventing

othere from coming too close to him. He in ego-centered and somewhat

wolfish and he will not lose sight of his personal advantage in whatever

he is doing.

He has developed a colorless and conmintent facade which

may serve an a cover for various activities he wants to hide. I he

considers it necessary, he can be quite versatile and be is able to

make quick changes and witches. In a closer relationship, he can

be rather enigmatic and he may surprise by unexpected actions and

reactions. He in guided by some ideological system (most likely of

collective nature) with ite fundamental ethical principles which he

followa meticulously on the suriace. In reality, he uses a number of

enmouflaging capacities (in a well-calculated and skillful manner) for

professional and social purposes. He is emotionally so detached, that

it 1n doubdul 11 he has any deep-going allegiance. Suggentions in line

with his nelf-centered interests could have a trong appeal for him

and posibly could alter his motivations. At the name time, he should

be very difficult to approach, especially, an he in somewhat unpredie-

table. He le emotionally rather atrained, but he evidently has sufficient

strength and enorgy at present to support his general functioning

adequately. He possesses a rather strong willpower and sufficient

power of resistance to withetand physical as well as emotional pressure.

He apparently has steeled himself in the course of hin life, and he can

become quite numb when he wants to. He is a rather peculiar person

who can to very puisling at times.

Summary:

The writer in a competent and meticulous worker in his pro-

fessional flold. Behind a harmles: front, he la an emotionally comples

and shrewd individual who could very well be involved in some well.

covered-up activities which are not part of his overt life. He is not

consistent and reliable and one must be prepared for sudden changes i

his reaction and action patters.

Qualification:

This report must be evaluated as qualified information because

the handwriting standards submitted for analysis are not adequate.
