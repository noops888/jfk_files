Through established sources such as the Cuban Army SIM and the

Bureau of Investigations of the Cuban National Police, this office made

inquiry concerning subject organization and has found no evidence there 13 a

any sort of recruiting campaign being carried on in Cuba as such.

Following the large scale publicity regarding the landing of

some $10,000, 000 worth of arms by a boat called the ALFHEM in Guatemala,

JATATTIN, a free lance newspaperuan in Havana, advised that the federacion

Estudiant1] Universitaria (FEU), the student organization in Havana

University, bad set up a table at the University to sign up volunteers to

help Guatemala defend her sovereignty; however, this appeared to be more

of a gesture on the part of the fEU with no intention of anyone going to

Guatemala.

That there is a definite tie-in between fome elements of the FEU

and Guatemala is demonstrated by the following:

On May 25, 1954, a source at the Bureau of Investigations

advised confidentially that a tap is being maintained on the telephone of

the FeU and that in this connection on lay 22, 1954, at 1:15 P.M. the

following telephone call from the FEU telephone was Intercepted. (a) el

Caracas Conference, rather than with any intention of recrutting people to

go to Guatemala to fight.

The committee have every evidence of being

strongly backed by the local Connunists if not actually organized by them.

CI HAV-2-S submitted the following summary concerning the activities of

this committee:

The recently organized "Comite Pro-Gratemala" of Cuba issued its

first public document last March 11, 1954. It follows:

•'"To the publio opinion of Cuba and America.

"The efforts of the people of Guatemala and of its last tro

governments to rescue the national richness and organize it to the service

of the nation and of the Guatemalan people, specially the Agrarian Reform

tending to expropriate the enormous holdings of the United Fruit Company,

have encountered an echo of sympathy in all America. The form in which

Guatemala has carried forward this nationalist policy, for the benefit of

all the sectors, of the peasantry and of the exploited Indian, through

scrupulous authorization of the Constitution and the law, and compensating

the Companies and individual owners, makes even more respectable this

democratic program.

However, against Cuatenale are directed today,

furiously, the forces. that insist in mintaining our countries under the

economic yoke and the most aborinable backwardness. The United Fruft and

the representatives of this exploiting polley, have organized numerous.

attempts to oust by. violence the Government of Guatemala; even now, this

Government has been forced to denounce a plot to invade the country in

which are involied notorious dictators such as ANSTASIU/SOuiano

RA FA EL BELONIDAS URU JILLO.

And as a complement of these criminal designs,

they are planning to use the caracas Conference -held in a country where

thousands of men are in jail for defending democracy - with the presence

of representatives of governments created through coups d'etat, to favor

the interference in the sister country and violate its sovereignty.

"It is necessary that the democratic forces of America Impede

this crime.

It Is possible that many Americans who work hard to achieve

the independent development of our countries may not agree with all the

aspects of the internal policies of Guatemala. But nobody with aims of

freedom, democracy and national progress, can remain indifferent before

the grim attempt to suffocate the just national aspirations of the sister

country. As in the case of Mexico and the oil expropriations of LAZARO

CARDENS, the destiny of luatemala represents today the possibility oi

constructing a Latin America free from oppressing ties.

"Favana, March 11, 19540.
