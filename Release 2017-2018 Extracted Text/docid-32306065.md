LA COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

With the recent murders of Thomas D'Angelo, his brother

James D'Angelo, and Prank Telleri, and in consideration of New

York City Police Department findings that the same automatic

weapon was used in these murders and in the attempt on Frank Mari's

life during 1966, there is good reason to believe that there will

be further violence between competing factions in the La Cosa

Nostra "family" previously headed by Joseph Bonanno.

In keeping with our responsibilities to maintain

coverage of high-level developments in organized crime in this

country, it will be most important that we keep abreast of this

situation. In that the warring factions would appear to be led

primarily by Mari, heading a group of tough younger hoodlums id

which one George Guarino and Loule (LNU) are described as the

"best guns," in opposition to a sonewhat similar group headed

by Salvatore Vincent Bonanno, with Joe Bonanno as the guiding

force, it will be important to fully identify these two groups.

As you are aware, experience has shown that it 1s in

periods of serious internal strife such as this that some of

our very best coverage of la Cosa Nostra has been developed;

and you should fully exploit the potential here for further

penetration through the use of existing top level informants

and supporting investigation.
