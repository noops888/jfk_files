The meeting began with a discussion of the considerably-

Increased activity in the dispatch, and preparation for dispatch,

of agent teams.

As a result of this discussion, it was agreed that

all plans for dispatch should be suspended pending further examination;

Instructions were issued during : he course of the meeting designed

to recall the three teams already on the way.

It was agreed that the first order of business with regard

to these teams is to examine in detail the requirements toward which

they could contribute.

General Lansdale will arrange to get ebt

into contact with: (a) General Carroll, to examine what military

requirements such agents could service; (b) similarly, the State

Department for policical intelligence requirements; (c) USIA for

requirements peculiar to that Agency. After this examination, it

will then be decided what the best use of these agent assets actually

should be.

2.

Mi. McCone and MI. Harvey said during the course of the

discussion on agent teams, that the action taken had represented a

unilateral decision by CIA and was not in response to specific

of responsibility, and particularly with respect to the first three

teams had considered that it was a continuation of previously-

approved operations. Mr. McCone commented

that internal security

in Cuba is now far more stringent than it was two weeks ago, thereby

making agent operations much more difficult; he felt, therefore, that

agent activity on this scale will only be justified if the responsible

departmeat

specifically require it for intelligence purposes.

this connection, General Taylor brought out that the

Chiefs

nad approved the use of submarines for agent dispatch but had

not been asked to review the operation in broader context. The

Chiefs had concluded, however, that no revolt should be etimulate

}

unless and until the U.S. is ready to support it and that the

military establishment does not wish to take over sabotage and

similar operations at this time, although it should be prepared

to do so if an invasion should be mounted. MI. McCone agzoad shet

It te pacsible that as the attuation-develope, -CIA Cuban operations

might maxe under silitar

ontrol, but that such action is not

Indicated at this time.

MI. Harvey made the point that the proposed agent dis-

patches would not use up all existing assets. He said that in the

che prop sed

event of invasion, a sizeable number of Cubans could be trained

quickly.

4. The Attorney General and General Lansdale emphasized

chat the Cubans are entirely prepared. to make the necessary sacrifices

1f they are in support of an approved plan. The Cubans do want,

however, assurances that such activities are in fact approved at

high level.

5.

Mr. Bundy emphasized the importance of planning for the

use of Cubans in political and civil activities during and after

any military action.

He felt that there should be established with

in the goverrment some sort of "Office of Free Cuban Affairs," which

probably should be placed within the Department of State. The

activities of this office would be distinct from General Lansdale's

operations but would be closely related to them. He pointed out

that top priority should be given to selecting

a man to head such

an office.

Mr. Bundy also said that he thought a subcommittee of

the NSC Executive Committee should be established to deal wich

MONGOOSE affairs.

6 .

Mr. McNamara thought that MONGOOSE in the short-term

should be considered in the context of (a) providing support for

action designed to get rid of the missiles, and (b) support for a

possible invasion.

Specific discussion took place on points raised in the

paper distributed at the meeting, as follows:

a.: CIA should continue to develop the balloon propaganda

facilities, although it was recognized that by the target date of

1 December this capability might no longer be needed because of other

methods of delivery.

b..... No major acts of sabotage should be undertaken at

this time. This decision will be reviewed in about a week.

General Lansdale should develop furcher plans to

"help the Cubans to help themselves." Mr. Morales-Carrion should

be brought into this planning.

d. Political planning for the post-Castro period will

be assigned to the "Office for Free Cuban Affairs."

Establishment of USIA's new 50 KW transmitter in

:the Florida Keys should be expedited.

8.

-It was reiterated that General Lansdale is the focal

point for all MONGOOSE activities, that he is charged wich their

overall management and that he should be kept informed of all

significant plans and activities in connection with the project.
