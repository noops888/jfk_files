A review of the files of the Miami Office re-

flected that by Bureau letter 4/28/61 to the New York

Office, under the caption FPCC, the Bureau forwarded

letter dated 4/12/6.1 which was received from CIA. The

CIA letter was classified SECRET.

The CIA letter stated

a fairly reliable source, not further identified, made ›

available a membership list of the FPCC.

The CIA source

did not state where or how he obtained the list. ' A com-

parison of the CIA list and the one forwarded as an

attachment to the referenced communication, reflected

The above referred to lists, however, are not

membership lists of the FPCC but rather a list of indi-

viduals who made a trip to Cuba in December, 1960 under

the sponsorship of the FPCC. .

Cubana Airlines, who at that time was

a PST made available a list containing 204 names. : This

list comprised the individuals who were scheduled to make

the Christmas trip to Cuba aboard Cubana Airlines, the

tour being sponsored by the FPCC.

list made available as an enclosure to the referenced

letter.
