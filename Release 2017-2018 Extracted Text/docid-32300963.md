source of the New Haven Livision, who has furnished

reliable

information in the past, advised tht he

was contacted on two occasions by RALPH TROPIANO,

who indicated to this source tht he was interested

in LOMBARDOZZI from the standpoint of he, TROPIANO,

making bond for LOMBARDOZZI, if bond were possible.

TROPIANO stated to this source that he would be

reponsible for IMBARDOZZI's bond.,

It developed that bond in this matter was not

allowable to LOMBARDOZZI, and he remained in the

custody of the government until August 23, 1963 at

which time he admitted in District Court that he,

LOMBARDOZZI, had violated his Connecticut probation.

At this time, the federal judge sentenced LOMBARDOZZI

to one year and denied a request that he be given

even a few days to arrange his personal affairs.

During the latter part of November, 1963, SALVATORE

ANNUNZIATO, a highly placed New Haven racketeer, who

might have some connection with the VITO GENOVESE

"family", was arrested by the New Haven Police Depart-

ment and charged with assault with intent to kill,

wherein ANNUNZIATO was alleged to have shot LAWRENCE

"LARRY" ZERNITZ, another New Haven hoodlum involved

in gambling activities.

At the time of the shooting, ANNUNZIATO was standing.

trial in New Haven courts charged with two separate

cases of aggrevated assault.

Bond in connection with the shooting affair was

placed at $50,000. ANNUNZIATO was able to arrange

bond by placing his home as collateral and property

owned by other members of his family.

A reliable source in the New Haven Police Department

advised that he had received confirming information
