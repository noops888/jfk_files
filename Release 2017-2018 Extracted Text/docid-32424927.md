Use of U.S. Military Personnel and Equipment. The

Group agreed that it would have to accept the proposicion that re-

supply operations will probably require U.S. military personnel

and equipment to include aircraft and seacraft. This point will

be included in che Guidelines. General Lansdale will arrange with

the Air Force to obtain an analysis of the risks which would be

Involved in

Supply operations over Cuba; this should be ready

by next week

at the meantime preparations should be begun for the

Â¿selection of

ersonnel and aircraft for necessary preliminaries,

such a "sheep-dipping." The Air Force will be asked fo cone up

within two weeks with an estimate of their capabilly

to provide

one or two parcraft for use in initial operations.

T2 connection with small boat operations, the Secre-

tary of Defedoe undertook to provide anything that was available

within the Defense establishment for which a requirement might be

established. It was pointed out there are no PT boats available

and chat foreign vessels will have to be acquired. CIA will present

a specific rea

for equipment other than PT boats, within the

next few days

4.

Mr. McNamara then raised the possibility that a decision

may be made which will make it impossible to use U.S. personnel.

He urged that planning, therefore, proceed on two tracks, assuming

that such personnel can be used in the initial phase but will not be

permitted later on. The Group felt that the Guidelines should re-

flect that, in the covert phase of this operation, U.S. personnel,

bases and equipment would be available but that the sicuation that

would exist in the face of a prohibition against such use must also

be studied immediately.

4. At the Attorney General's suggestion, General Lansdale

undertook to examine the possibility of sabotage or other means of

destroying the Soviet boats which have been or will be delivered

to Cuba

6

one proposed underwater reconnesssance of the babe eas

of Hava

da was approved, after the statement by General Lemnitzer

that amphibious planning cannot

seed without this and that the

risk is virtually non-existent.

It was agreed that the Group should give a status report

to higher authority this week, to include discussion of general

principles and guidelines.
