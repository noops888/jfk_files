Re Los Angeles airtel, 8/17/66.

on 9/21/66, MARIE ALTOBELLI, 807 Dean Street,

that she is a cousin of TANCREDI

TORTORA.

She stated that back in the 1920's TORTORA visited her often

and stayed at her home.

FILIPPO SACCO was a friend of TORTORA's

and visited TORTORA at

her home. She denied that SACCO

ever stayed at her home.

The only thing she knew about SACCo

was that he came from Boston, Massachusetts.

She did not know

any relatives nor associates

of his, (to SAS DONNELLY & DURKIN).

She

said that following the arrest of TORTORA

she never saw SACCO again.

A 1925 and 1930 photo of JOHN ROSELLI was exhibited

to her and she advised she did not know if this was FILIPPO

SACCO or not, because it has been so many years ago.

She stated that she does not know anybody named

ROSELLI and specifically not JOHN ROSELLI.
