GAMBLING ACTIVITIES IN THE

CARIBBEAN AREA

AR

MICHAEL J. MC LANEY (former MM 764-C-TE) on

8/25 and

8/26/69, advised that he secured a contract with

the Haitian Government to operate the International Casino

in Port-au-Prince, Hiti, to open any additional gambling

casinos in Haiti and place slot machines in some of the

Haitian hotels. This contract is for ten years and covers

a graduated rental, etc.

The gambling casino is scheduled

for opening on 10/1/69.

MC LANEY claims he never bought the contract,

meaning that he never paid anyone to secure same or promised

anyone any sum or consideration to obtain it. He also

states he intends to bar the hoodlum element and will

supply the Miami Office a list of his employees he intends

to employ, as well as other information concerning his

operation and any other information coming to his attention

which he believes may be of value to this Bureau.

One copy is being forwarded to New York Office

for information because MC LANEY and others were indicted

in New York City on 7/1/69, for Conspiracy, Mail Fraud

Wire Fraud and Perjury.
