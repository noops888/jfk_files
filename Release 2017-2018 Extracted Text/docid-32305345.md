(A) ACTIVITIES OF MILITANT ANTI-CASTRO EXILES -- On several

occasions during the past six months you have been alerted to the

possibility that anti-Castro Cuban exiles in this country might travel

to Canada to attack Cuban establishments and to the possibility that

these exiles may attempt to harm, demonstrate against, or embarrass

Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos and Prime Minister Fidel Castro if

they go to Canada to visit EXPO 67 in July, 1967, and/or to attend the

Pan American Games scheduled to be held in the latter part of July and

the early part of August, 1967.

We have now received concrete information indicating that

cuban exiles are planning the assassination and kidnapping of severa.

cuban officials in Canada. (Mu

In this connection, a New York source has reported that the

Movimiento Nacionalista Cubana (Cuban Nationalist Movement - CNM),

a militant anti-Castro group, is planning an attempt on the life of

Prime Minister Castro if he visits EXPO 67, Montreal, Canada, on

July 26, 1967, Cuban National Day at the exposition. In addition, the

source reported that if Castro does not appear the CNM in union with the

Movimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR),

another militant anti-Castro organization, plans to kidnap the Cuban

Ambassador to Canada and hold him for the ransom of nine prisoners

in Cuba who were captured during the ill-fated invasion of Cuba in April,

1961. Reportedly, the exiles intend to kill the Cuban Ambassador to

Canada regardless of whether the prisoners are released.

()

The CNM is also considering the possibility of a simultaneous

action at the Pan American Games which are to be held in Winnipeg,

Canada, from July 27, 1967, to August 8, 1967. This action will involve

the kidnapping of some of the Cuban athletes participating in the games

including the Cuban Minister of Sports, Jose Llanusa, who will accompany

the Cuban team. eXU)

The Bureau cannot stress too strongly the absolute necessity

of alerting sources and informants to immediately report information

concerning plans of Cuban exiles and others to assassinate,
