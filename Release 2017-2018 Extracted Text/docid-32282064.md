ReBu airtel 7/9/64, advised that CIA, on 7/8/64,

reported that the infornation in the 4/8/64 CIA memorandum

came from two sources.

CIA, however, did not have their

identities available. CIA advised that it was instructing

CIA, Miami, to furnish the Miani Office the identities of

the

sources involved, and to make the sources available to

the Miami Office for interview.

On 7/10/64, TEA DEFILE I CIA, covert, Miami, ad-

vised that it would be necessary for him to confer with his

headquarters prior to revealing the sources of information.

0п 7/13/64 -

stated he was still discussing

the matter with his headquarters, and would notify the

Miami Office when the sources were available.

It is noted that referenced Bu airtel refers spec-

ifically to the sources in the memorandum dated 4/8/64. in

view of the conflicting information obtained through inter-

view of TEOFILO BABUN SELMAN and his associates, ELISEO

GONEZ FERNANDEZ and OSCAR FERNANDEZ VEIGA and the informa-

tion obtained through interview of JULIO LOBO at New York,

It would be of interest to the Miami Office to have the

sources of the information set out in the CIA memorandum of

6/10/64, available for interview, particularly with regard

to the information appearing in Paragraphs 3,.

6 and 8.

The Bureau is requested to advise whether the

question of making these, sources available for interview

by the Miami Office was discussed with CIA.
