feels that perhaps ve understated the degree

of concealment as outlined in reference B.

It is agreed that a

sophisticated echnical search would probably find the device we

planted but all personnel at the scation involved witi this operation

agreed that such a search was most unlikely.

The case officer

dealing directly with LIRING-s also minimized the possibility of

IRING-3 mering any kind of a search.

All of these points were

considered before making the Installation.

dealing with the activities of tIrISG-3.

Although LIRING 3 and his wife moved back to their old

apartment on Tacubaya in early May, LIRING-3 uses the apart

mont covered by LIFEAT for "bucinose" purpesos.

much above what they can really afford and was afraid that the

local Cubans might ask questions in this connection. LIRING-A's

father, incidentally finally succeeded in getting a

entry visa and is coming to Mexico City in the near iuture to

spend two or three weeks with his daughter.

The attached report dated 8 May indicates that

LIRING 3 may have found another local channel to the Guatemalan

DOC. MICRO. BER.

Analysis of LIFEAT Iraiiic kelating to IIRING/3. fOI

the Feriod 19-26 April, 1957.

д''

1. In revlewing the traffic for the period indicated Forton foriá

valuaule confirmation of LIRING/3 and IIRING/4 contact with Rames

Abreu, indicating that both persons complied vith. Routon's suggestions.

LIRING/3'g telepbonic contacts with Enrique Morales In Guatemal= City

confirned reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the evert.

The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 1s a dinner enezze-

ment which Enrique Morales bad in Guatemala City on 25/4/67 wits "Iriends"

of Morales' wife, Esperanza. SAN-10 (17.5) also reveals that IT G/3

and liorales are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of purses

or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guatemala or San Cristóbal for resale

in Mexico City or import into the U.S. at a higher price. (LIRTU3/3

mentioned the opportunities in this line to Rowton previously, i Row-

ton did not react favorably).

2. The following are Rowton's comments on specific portions of te take

which will serve to clarify them in relationship to reports made to him

by LIRING/3 and LIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Raniro Abreu: On 22/4/67, shortly aftze gowton

suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to eflect tarough

him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephozed the

Embassy and attampted to reach Abreu. From the content and izze of ber

Questions and remarks, it appears obvious that IIRING/4 has set had Ie-

cent contact with the Cuban mission. She ass when Abreu is leaving for

Havana, but is given no information. She tries sgain at about 1900 and

2000, but there is no answer. She finallt sets through to firea on

1413-26 who promises to come to her home between 1000 and 1100 the

following day (23/4/67). She has to give Abreu the address, indicaiing

that he is not faulliar with the home address of LIRING/3 or/4.

SAN-10 (5.0,8.2,12.2) reveal that Abreu called or talked to IarING/4

on the telephone three times on 24/4/67. IIRNG/4 makes referezce to

"so much analysis, so many theories and ideas" which apparently vere dis

cussed between her and Äbreu at their 23/4/67 conversation. Stder re-

marks made both by LIRING/4 and Abreu Indicate that Abreu 18, or watne

to become emotionally involved with LIRING/4, who at least 'in ordo ap-

color 1+611138973177

pears to have encouraged him. These fontacts were reported to zowton

1a substance by LIRING/3, although Rowton has not as yet had a chance

to talk directly with LIRING/4 to get her version of the conversationa

with Moreu. Apparently in order to put Abreu off (in bia amonous de-

signs) LIPING/4 teals him on 25/4/67 that her husband sunpocts that

sorething is going on between shen. In roply to Abreu's anxious ques

tioning, LIRING/4 states that her husband asked her whether she liked

Abreu and wether Abreu like her, to which she said that the replied it

the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off

without alienating hin). Abreu's visit to the ppartment ind his pro-

poed luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confimmed by the latter in his

report to Rowton on 27/4/67•

Conversations Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) IIRING/3 asks

his Guatemalan friend (Jacobo iodriguez Padilla?) whether it matters 11

the birth contificate te for a person 10 years older? Jacoho replied

In the negative, but would prefer it of a person ten years younger.II-.

RIIG/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his possession by

25-26/4/57. This is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state

ment made to him some two weeks previously that when he wont to pick us

the (false) birth certificate at Registro Civil on instructions of his

half-brother (and the lawyer Folando Riojas) he discoverid that it was

for a person born in 1916 and hence useless for binself. LiRiNG/3 also

reported to Rowton that Jacobo had contacted him recently and asked for

help in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation

therefore would indicate that IIRING/3 plans to sive Jacobo the false

document originally procured for himself through his half-brother. LI-

RING/3, however, has not revezled this plan to Rowton.

SAI-11 (16.0) reveals that LIMING/3 informed his brother two days later

that he has spent over ten days at Registro Civil but it la "impossible

to set the birth certificate. Ibe book no longer exiests." He adds that

he has written his half-brother a letter explaining everything. IIRING/3

reportod to Rowton that he had asked his balf-brother to obtain an

"acta notorial" in lieu of brito certificate and hoped to have the doci

ment soon.

Walldog Mifor Mating with LIKING/3.

1. Rowton met with IIRING/3 at the safebouse at 1800 on 4 Nay, 1957.

LIRING/3 reported that he bad been working with the Secretarait of

Commerce and Industry to obtaintho license for the importation of the

plastic flowers and that be had told Enrique orales Guerra to stand

by until the formalities of the license were completed. He added that

as a matter of fact he had not made any commitment to korales and did

not feel under any obligation to continue to use bim, even in the flower

business, especially if Roston had any further reservations about bin.

2. Regarding his friend Sergio González Marin of the Secretariat of

Commerce and Industry, LIRING/3 co mented that, as he had reported pre-

viously to Rowtor, the latter had formerly been a member of the Connunist

Party of Mexico, but was no longer active. LIRING/3 added that his sis-

ter, dunever, calize

Conction Marin, was a very active nember of the

Party and married tol a Raúlmoreno, who was also most probably a wenber

of the Communist Party. LIstNG/3 continued that both Raúl loreno and

Silva and himself (LIRING/3) had a mutual friend Sergicialdez who had

excellent contacts in extreme leftist circles. LIRING/3 added that sergio

Valdez was the son of the Siempre correspondent and associate of Alberto

Domingo, as well as fico Galán. According to LIRING/3, Sergio Valdez 18

not a formal party member and still a student uf art at the University.

LIRING/3 stated that be knew nim farily well since he had been one of

his (LIRING/3's) students for several years. LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez' teiephone number is 20-90-10, ext. 12.

3. In addition to the above, LIRIN/3 recounted that about 2 May, 1967, in

a conversation with Raúl Moreno, he had learned that Moreno is friendly

with the FAR responsible for Propaganda at the National University. iI-

RING/3 commented that such a person would surely know "Garcia" of FAR,

and that therefors he planned to arrange a meeting with him through Raul

Moreno at the first opportunity.

4. In preparation for a possible ICFLUTTER examination of LIRING/3 on

9 or 10 May, Rowton stated to him at the end of the meeting that be was

prepariug a number of questions that still bothered bim so that LIRING/3

could five a definitive reply that would close the matter for once and

all. LIRING/3 replied that he was anxious to answer any questions Rowton

might have and hoped that this would resolve any problem and dispell ang

lingering doubts that Rowton

might still have concerning his bone fidea.

TDY REFORT FOR

Joseph I. RESCIGNO

11-20 May 1967

I. Bite: Mexico City, Mexico

II. Dates: 11-20 May 1967

III.

Objective: The purpose of the trip by RESCIGNO was to

provide

support to the station on two priority audio

operations (set up the LIRING/3 LP and the LIRUSTIC/1

installation). This support was provided in addition

to the TDY support being rendered by Reginald S. JENKON

a replacement for CORNBURY who was on sick leave.

IV. Chronology:

RESCIGNO departed Kational Airport for Mexico City

via American Airlines at 0800, 11 May 1967 and arrived

1n Mexico City at 1100, 11 May 1967 (all times local).

After checking into the Palace Hotel, R. reported to

the Station by telephone.

Station contact was made

through SLINKARD who advised R. to come into the Station.

R. discussed relative target priorities and then met

with the respective case officers concerned with the

operations.

The rest of the day vas

spent checking out

equipment

for possible use on the LIRUSTIC/1 operation.

The following day

was spent plauning and becoming lanillat

with the LIRUSTIC/1 operational situation, infiltrating

equipment into the base/uP and setting up a cover story.

No operational work

was planned for the above

operation for the weekend; therefore, the LIRING/3 LP

equipment vas checked out and the lP equipment set up

in the Lp on Saturday.

The equipent used vas & T-204

Revere Recorder (110 VAG, 50 cycle) and an SPR-2A

carrier current receiver.

The occupant of the Lp mas

briefed in the operation of the cauipment.

There ras

no conversation lu the lp during the briefing; consequently,.

R. planned to return the following week to determine

relative reference levels of all control gettings to

assist the LP operator in unking his recordings.

Entry

into the target to inspect the installation was not

considered operationally possible over the weekend and

the case officer made plans with the LP operator for a

meeting loter in the week.

sonday through Thursday of the following

Took was

devoted to the LIRUSTIC/! Installation which 1s the

subject cf a, separate report.

RESCIGNO purchased a telephore locally to be used

na a replacement for a cofective instrument in the Lp

for the DAARGO operation.

The existing telephone

extersion was malfunctioning aud would ring only inter-

mittently.

Since the LP had sone extra telephone

cables

terminating at the house, the case officer did not want

to request a normal telephone company service call.

Thursday evening,

18 May 1967, was scheduled for

testing the two installetions

that were completed on

thE LISANPAN operation; however,

upon reporting the

successful installation in the LIZUSTIC/l target,

RESCIGNO was informed that the telephone company

was to

so cording on the dietribution box where the loop

concections vere to be nade.

Consequently, the testies

of the installations was postponed until

the telephote

company personnel complete their work in the aren.

On Friday norning, the LIRIFG/3 LP was again

visited to check

the operation of the equipent and

to establish relative reference levels for the operator

to obtain optimum results.

The target as occupied and

a recording ras nade of a telephone cal. and a discussion

vita a book

salcamen.

The operation of the equipment

was satisfactory,

The technical details of the target

installation vere thoroughly reviewed in consideration

of the operational situation.

Tbe case officer was

completely satisfied that the type of installation was

definitely adequate fron a gecurity standpoint in this

particular situation.

The target equipment was

functioning normally vith no technical problems; there

fore, a re-entry into the

target vas not considered

necessary, CORNBURY expressed a similar view when the

operation was discussed with his that afternoon.

The page-boy systen was discussed with the Station

and RESCIGNO was inforned that tests had been made and

1t was decided to install a higber galt antenna to

reach outlying areas.

The Station plans to put the

system into operation as soon as tha antenna la received

and installed.

The Lp for the LIRUSTIC/1 installation ms set up

on Friday on the trip fro the Station to the airport.

CORNBURY returned to the Station on Friday afternoon

at 1430.

RESCIGNO departed the same evening at 1800

because he was unable to obtain reservations for the

return trip on Saturday or Sunday.

This was caused by

the holiday rush and RESCIGNO had been requested to be

available at Fendquarters the next week for another

operation where his participation had been tentatively

discussed.

RESCIGNO arrived in Washingten on Saturday,

20 May 1967, at 1000.

Monthly Report of Developments in the LIRIiG/3 Operation,

for the Period 1-30 April, 1967.

1. During the month of April, Rowton was able, through valuable leads

furnished by LIFEAT intercepts, to put strong pressure on IIRING/3 to

present acceptable proof of a number of staterents that be had made to

Rowton. At his meeting with LIRISG/3 on 19 April, Rowton confronted II-

RING/3 with suspiciong be entertained concernitz the proposed acquisi-

tion of a false birth certificate as well as the identity of "Garcia",

the FAR representative. The sessios, which lasted over two hours, shook

IIRING/3 so much emotionally that IIRING/4 became alarmed and telephoned

Rowton's answering service the folloring morning. Rovton was able to ex-

ploit this opportunity to talk privately with IIRING/4 end to lay the

foundation for an independent working relationship with her against tar

gets of interest in the local mission.

2. In addition to initiating a positive effort to verify LIRING/3's bona

fides and reliability, Rowton's confrontation paved the way toward a

closer and more productive relationship with hin in the future. LIRING/3

assured Rowton that be considered his work for Rowton the most important

thing in his life and was willing to do anything to prove that his in-

tuetions were nonorable and dis reporting reliaule. As a rasult Ronton is

currently in a position to challenge any or all of LIRING/3's statements,

and to give him much more specific direction than was possible in the

past.

3. The following are Rowton's comments on specific developments during the

month in summary form:

a) Developments with respect to Cuba: On 19 April, LIFEAl intercept

SAN-7(9.0) revealed that both LIPING/3 and LIRING/4 were virtually

Isolated from the Cubars. In the conversation with the Mexican Rojas

LIRING/3 stated that "he and his wife no longer have anything to do

with those people", and LIRING/4, in conversation with the same person,

added that she "feels like vomiting when she sees them". Both LIRING/3

and 14 admitted this situation to Rowton on 22 April when be talked to

each privately. LIRING/4 explained her dislike for the Cuban employees

of the mission originated in the "rude manner in which she was thrown

out into the street" some six monthe previously. LIRING/3 confessed

that he could not explain why his close frieads Arnol Rodriguez and

Rene Ochoa had not communicated with him over the past month, despite

his messages and telephone calls. He felt an uneasy suspicion that the

Julian Lopez alfair, as well as the Rico Galán letter, had caused certain

elements localiy and in Havana to become hostile toward hin.. ITniHG/3

noted that Lepeda had been presont when LIRING/4 had blown ber top in

the Ambassador's office and that he (LIRING/3) had turned down Cepeda'a

invitation to accompany him to Havana shortly after the return of Julian

Lopez. In any case LIRING/3 agreed that the best, or, nore candidly, the

only course of action opez to him was to play a waiting game and continue

his work with the Guatemalans in the hope that the Cubans, sooner or later

would recontact him. He stressed that only after he has established firm

and viable cover through the plastic flower business will be be able to

lace a thorough interrogation by the DSE in lavang ait chthe expects,

should he return at this time). He feels that he

wak enough Greeks

to date ( Econonou, Frevolis, Batsakis, Gasdazlis, Arvanitis) in botb Mexico

City and Guatesala City, to justify his relationship with Rowton on a

purely commercial level, should that become necessary.

LIR 1G/3 accepted 'Rowton'

s recoimendation that LIRING/4 overcone her

apparent visceral dislike for the Cubang in the mission and effect a re-

conciliation with them as soon as possible. After Rowton's personal appeal

to her, she succeeded in recontacting Ramiro Abreu on 22 April, and re-

mained in almost daily contact with him until he left Mexico on 30 April.

Through Abreu she re-established contact witz Curbelo, Cepeda, and other

employees of the Consulate, inciuding Enrique Cicard. This gave LIRING/3

an opportunity to chat with Abreu concerning his own situation with the

result that breu promised to get sone word out to LIRILG/3 concerning

the attitude of bis friends in Havana. Abreu invited LIRING/3 back to

Havana, but the latter turned this down diplomatically (for the reasons

mentioned above).

b) Developrents with Respect to Guatemela: The identity of "Carcia",

the FAR represestative, has continued to occupy the attention of Rowton.

An attempt by the Station team to surveilt Garcia when he allegedly picked

up the medicine from LIRING/3 on 28 March was unsuccessful (Rowton spottei

LIRING/3 leaving bis house at about 0815, just as the team was taking pos1-

tions and before they could identify LIRING/3). Another opportunity to

surveIl LIRIiG/3, Garcia,as woll as Enrique jorales, was lost on the even

Matters, however, have been simplified after.

the confrontation of LIRING/3

by Boston on 22 April, inasnuch as LIRING/3 promised to notify Rowton 1n

advance of the next neeting with Garcia, explicitly for the purpose of

Rowton's getting

a look at Garcia to identify him. In addition on 1 ray,

LINDiG/3 inforned Rowton that Garcia had telephoned hin the preceding day

to set a date for their next neeting on 18 lej, when Garcia stated he

would be back from Guatenala. LIziT take for 30 April should confirm or

refute this statement.

During the month LIRING,3 maintained contact with Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla

Alicia Echeverría as well as Carsen Carrasco. LIFTAT Intercepts confimmed

LIRIIC/3 reports, at least as far as actual contact was concerned.

c) Developments with Respect to the False Birth Certificate: Uppa his re-

turo from northern Nexico on 6 April, LIKING/3 reported that he had made

arrangements to obtain a false birth certificate for future use through

his half-brother and a certain lawyer named Folando Riojas(for a 2,000

peso deal, Irreen intorcoate arouded Poution's suspicions eoncerning the

role, if any, played by Riojas, and served as a biasis for Ronton's heart-

to-heart talk with LIRING/3 on 22 ipril, LIRING/3 clained that the false

birth certificate produced by his balf-brother and Riojas was not suitable

since it applied to a person bora in 1916. This appears to bave been the

tnuth, as indicated in LIRING/3's conversaticy with Jacobo Rodriguez Pa-

dilla on 23 April (SAN-10(2.5), although Rowten still has doubts concern-

ling the existence and role plajed by Rolando 220jas. Ilkewise, hiRING/3's

report that his half-brother was to provide bic with an affidavit in lieu

of birth certificate in the nane of Alberto Zérate Vidal, (a name chosen

by LIRING/3 hinself), was proved to be true wden LIRTiG/i gave Riwton the

originalin of the court papers on 29 April.

d) Covor spects of the IIRING/3 Oseration: Furing the first week of April

KIRING/3 traveled to northern Mexico (Sabines, juevo Loredo) and Del Rio,

Texas, and, in collaboration with his half-brother and a certain Sergia

Arche of VIlla Acuña, established a notional company ("Floriex") 112 Del

Rio as a buyer for the plastic flowers assembled in San Cristóbal. This

was done, according to iIRING/3, in order to satisfy the requirements of

Martinez and check on the rental of the propesed factory. The "Plastiflor

de San Cristóbali was registered as a company locally, and Enrique Morales

continued on to Guatemala City where he net with Con tantine Gasdaglis,

Wallace B. Roston Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Roston met with LIkIlG/3 at the salehouse (Tacubaya) briefly at

1000 on 1 May, 1967. LIRIIG/3 reported that "Garcia" had telephoned

him on the preceding day to tell hin that he had to nase another trip,

this time to Guatenala and that he would be returning on 18 May, 196%.

LIRING/3 added that Garcia Indicated that he would see ITRING/3 on that

date or a lew days thereafter, and planned to introduce him to a

friend who would be in a position to see bin nore frequently in the

future. LIRIIG/3 told Rowton he agein mentioned the payment for the

medicines and Garcia assured him that it would be settled at their

next meeting.

2. LIRING/3 also reported that Abreu departed on 30 April, ratber than

on 29 April,as anticipates, He said that he had therefore had achance to

meet with dureü again, me Istter encouraged him to beep in touch with

him and promised to get some sort of message to LIRDiG/3 from Arnol

Rodriguez and/or Cienfuego. According to LIRING/3 abreu asked him whether

he would be willing to visli his friends in avana again in the near

future to discuss his situation personally, indicatize that he would

arrange for an invitation as soon as he returned. IJaINiG/3 told Rowton

he thanked Abreu but stated that at the moment he was very busy with his

commercial obligations and could not find the time. Le assured Abreu that

as soon as he got things rolling in San Cristóbal and Guatemala, be

would welcome the chance to visit lavana again.

3. LIRING/3 then stated that he and LIRING/i had talked over the matter

of her father's visit at length, and had also talked again to him by tele-

phone In response to his two calls), and had come to the conclusion that

It was more practical that LIRING/4's father come to Mexico City after all,

since a trip to Montreal was too costly and it appeared impossible to con-

vince LIRING/4'g father that he should not come to visit his daughter at

her hone. LIPING/3 added that he planned to have LIZING/4 take her father

on as many excursions as possible outside lexico City to keep his visit

as quiet as possible. He said that in any event IIING/4's father could

not make the trip before 20 May, 1967, when bis vacation would begin.

4. LIRING/3 then mentioned that both he and LIRING/4 felt that they should

returu to the Tacubaja spartment to live. le explained that LIRIiG/4 bad

originally noved into the former safehouse at his request to satialy the

curiosity of the landlady, sra. Sanchez. He felt that this had already

been accomplished and sna Sanchez was not likely to ask any further

questions. Also both he and TIRING/4 were worried about suspicions that

night be aroused on the part of the local Embassy and Consular staff 1f

they continued to reside there. Abreu had already raised his eyebrows

slightly and appeared satisfied wiia LIRING/3'g explanation that he had

rented the apartment for sone friends who were out of the country tempor

arily. LIRING/4 is not confortable in the apartment, especially since she

may have to face her former colleagues frequently is she resumes her work

In the Consulate. According to LIRING/3, she feels they are better off

in relatively nodest surroundings, since they bave fewer questicos to ans-

wer and explanations to give. Their old apartment (tacubaga) also has

two separate bedrooms and would be more convenient when her

father comes

to visit tuem. LIRING/3 stated that ho could, of course, continue to

use the toyae apartment to see souton and meet discreetly with thion

tacts, as previously.

bagged.

S. In view of the above, Rowton suggested that LIRING/3 infore lis friends,

particularly the Cubans, that the Atoyac apartment had been rented for

his Greek friends from Guatemala and Venezuela who planned to establish

a plastics factory here in liesico and needed a place to stay during their

visits. LIRING/3 felt this would be acceptable, since by now he had good

working contacts with Batsakis and Gasdaglis in Guatemala City and would

soon be seeing irvanitis and possibly others. Rowton also suggested that

if it became necessary to explain his contacts with the Greeks to the cu

bans, he should say that his original contact was with Pandelis Econonou

re the importa:lin of retaras cognac (this is true) and that be had met

Stylianos Prevolis and continued to work through him on the recommendation

of Economou (when the latter returned to Atbens).

6. LIRING/3 stated thut he planned to revisit his friends in the Secreta

riat of Connerce (porticularly & señor Llamas of the Plastics Committoe)

to obtain the import license for the first shipment of disassembled

flowers to San Cristóbal.

•Wallace B. Rowton

P.S. LIRING/3 also gave Rowton the attached data on Enrique lorales

and his wife. le indicated tbet Esperanza Morales knows lavarrette

1. Rowton net with LIRING/3 at the safehouse at 1800 on 27 April,

and at 0845 on 29 April, 1967. It the first meeting LIRING/3 gave

Rowton the new letterhead paper of the Plastifor de San Cristóbal

company and report:] that he had been in telephonic contact with

Enrique fiorales in Guatenala City and has passed on to him Rowton's

message instructing him, (as per LIRING/?'s suggestion) to contact

Mr. Constantinos Gasdaglis of the Metaloplástica Guatenalteca to be

shown through the factory and given some unassembled amaples of the

plastic flowers. This had been suggested by LIRLiG/? inasnuch as Mr.

Angelo Arvaritis had not arrived in Guatenala City from Caracas as

anticipated.

2. At both meetines LIRING/3 reported almost daily contact with Ramiro

Abreu either pessonally or by phone. He stated that he had had a private

talk with Abreu, in which the latter attempted to snooth over the ap

parent difficulties lining/3 was having with the Cubans, by stating trat

nobody really had anything against LIRING/3. When the latter showed bis

dissatisfaction with such

a brush-off, Abreu mumbled sonetbibg about

the Julian Lopez affair and added that there were "certain thiugs he

was not in a position to discuss". Abreu insinutated that Cepeda was

more or less hostile. although he himseli did not share Cepeda's atti

tude. At this point IIRING/3 inserted the comment that when LIRING/4

blew up some six months age(on the day that sue was fired) in the An

bassador's office, Cepeda was present, and he apparently resented the

action even more than the Ambassador. LIHING/3 agreed with Routon that

In light of the current situation the best course of action would be to

Give LIRING/4 a chance to re-establish cordial relationg with her forser

colleagues, particularly Cepeda, since she had the advantage of being a

Cuban and former employee herself.

3. with regard to other comments made by Abreu, LIRING/3 stated that be

definitely felt that Abreu was naking a pitch for direct and continuing

contact with him, even after Abreu returned to Havssa. LIRING/3 stated

to Rowton that he gently brushed this off, stating to Abreu that he had

certain understaddings with Arnol Rodriguez and snant Cienfuego and for

that reason did not feel free to enter into any operational relatiosbip

with anyone else. He concluded this discussion with a comment that 11

Abrou could somehow get a message to bin fron either Arnol Rouriguez or

Cienfuego designating Abreu as their liaison, IIRI'GY3 would be glad to

accommodate. LIRING/3 added to Rowton that he gave Abreu a sketchy idea

of what he was doing in establishing co-nercial ties with both Guate=ala

and Texas,.

Abreu appeared intensely interested and when LIRING/3 showed

him the letterbead of the new"coopany" in San Cristóbal, Abreu snapped

up the paper and envelope and slipped tien into his pocket. LIRING/3 told

Rowton that he expressed to Abreu his intention of continuing his efforts

along the commercial lines, regardless of the lack of entbusiamm sbob to

him by the Cubans.

4. At the 29 April reeting LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that Enrique Morales

had returned safely from Guatenala City, after having met with Constantine

Gasdaglis and obtained from hin samples of the flowers. Since Ro::ton had

almost reached the conclusion that LIRIlC/3 has known Enrique Morales for

several years (contrary to his story thet he met him through "Garcia")Row

ton threw in at this point the comment thai ne bad been checking oi u-

rales, through a Mexican Dunn and Bradstreet type firm he uses in business,

and found that Morales has a poor dredit rating, is married, and is an

artist by profession ( actual source of this info is LIFEAT intercepts).

IIFING/3 appeared surprised at the accuracy of Rowton's report and adaittee

that Morales was a painter, although he did not earn enough from his work

to live. IIRING/3 olso stated that Morales had used the 500 pesos pajzent

he had made to him to liquidate an overdue loan at a bank, but that he was

currently out of debt and in good credit standing.

5. At the same meeting IIRINQ/3 reported that he had been in toucn with

his half-brotber regarding the false birtbeertificate and informed his

half-brother that the one presented to him was for a man born in 1916 and

hence useless for his own as purposes. iccording to LIRING/3, his bother

proposed an even better idea, the procurement of an "acta notorial" in

which it would state that the person named therein had never been regis-.

tered. LIRING/3 pointed out that this would be more valid legally even

than a birthcertificate since it would be isnued by a court rather than

simply by the Rigistro Civil. He then added that he might fortunately

fill two birds with one atone, but using the aifidavit in lieu of birth

certificate for himself and give the fals birthcertificate to his friend

Jacobo (Rodriguez Radilla) who had asked him to help procure a false docu

ment. Rowton agreed that this would be the best solution and ask when II-

RING/3 hoped to have the papers. He replied that his half-brother had al

ready sent the acta notorial on the morning: bus from Sabinas (Coah.) and

that he was to pick it up from the bus driver early that sane afternoon.

6. LIRING/3 then reported to Roston that the Consulate had asked IIRIiG/4

to come back to work on a part-time basis. According to lIRLiG/3, bota

he and IIRIIG/4 dregsed their feet on any connitment until they could re-

fer the matter to Rowton. LIRING/3 commented that the thought of LIRING/4

being again in such close contact with such types did not make him happy

but be agreed with Rowton that this perhaps would serve to re-establisn

his own relationship with then. LIRING/3 adritted that it had been very

convenient to have LIRING/4 inside the establishment, especially since

she could pick up messages for him and keep her ear to the ground and her

eyes open for gossip. Rowton replied that in view of this development he

felt that he sbould have another private chat with LIRING/4 and asked II-

RIFG/3 to inform her that he would be calling on her that afternoon at

about 1700. LIRING/3 discreetly stated that he planned to be out at tbat

time in any case seeing his chiären (by bis ex-wiie).

7. Rowton spent sone 90 minutes with

LIRIiG/4 at her home that afternoon.

She reported thet she had made out much better that expected with Abreu,

who came running when

she telephoned bin sportly after Rowton left her on

the evening of 22 April. She added that be came to the house that evering

in the compary of Curbelo ami made a date to see her againthe next morning.

She commented that Abreu, who had always had a sort of crush on her, was

delighted and pleasantly surprised by her initiative. He confessed that

he thought IIRING/4 wanted a visa to go bac's home, and was relieved to

find that she was not in any difficulty. ITRING/4, in her typical candia

manner, adaitted that Abreu's interest in her was probably personal, but

she felt that she had accomplished what Forton wanted in her own feninine

Way. Rowton congratualted her and asked her to continue her efforts, parti

cularly with Cepeda and the others in the nission.

8. IIRIiG/4 then explained that on her visit to the Embassy, abreu, in the

presence of Cepeda and others, almost jokingly said they were understaffed

and why didn't LIRING/4 come back to help them out in the office. LIFI:G/4

told Rowton that she immediately

showed interest but did everything she

could fron appearing overenthusiastic. Ste commented to Rowton that one

must not run after such people, but make them dance a bit first so that.

they would appreciate: anything they get. IIRIlG/4 continued that she

replied to ibreu that

she would think it over, but in any case would not

want a repetition of the treatment she received last timbe. All sorts of

assurances were given to her, but,despite this she made no commitment

since she wished to talk the offer over with LIRING/3 and kowton.

9. WIRING/* also reported that she had set the new consul, Earique

Cicard, and found hin rather pleasant. She said that she piarned to

Invite him to dinner on evening soon so that LIIING/3 could chat with

bin. LIRING/4 then commented that the only problem with Kata Cicard

nould be Snidal in the Pless Office (as Lowton recalls) who das Cicard's

roomnate. She explained that Sarambu was a member of the Cosmunist Farüy

and appeared to be a toug" nut to crack. She surprised Routon by adding

that Cepede appeared easier to her, the only problen with bim was how to

find an opening - some common interest she could exploit. Also regard

ing the part-tine work, she said that she did not take it too seriously,

since Aracell and Mirabal were coming back from javana and hence they

woald not bo so short-bandod. Rowton mentioned she micht also offer to

help the Mexican Rojas who had telephoned her recently. She agreed and

cormented that Rojas had told her that he had finally been invited into He

vana for a brief visit...

•10. Rowtor then brought up the problem of LIRING/4'g father, LIRING/4 con-

fired what LIRING/3 had told Rowton that rorning!

i.e. that her father

had just announced that he had succeeded in obtaining the visitor's visa

from New Jork and that when she had telephoned him suggesting they meet

in San Antonio (to avoid his appearing in Mexico City at this time), her

father had balked, saying that if he were coming all the way to San An-

tonio he nught as well continue on a littie more and 50 to lezico City.

LIRING/4 explained to Rowton that she could not possibly set across to

her father the real reason she wanted to seet him in the U.S. (to avoid

arousing suspicions on the aprt of such types as Cepeda) and she had to:

let the matter drop. She added that there was also the problen of the

visa to the U.S. which she did not want in her passport. Boston offerred

to obtain the visa through business friends in Houston ra:ber painlessly,

but LIRI G/4 insisted that this would be a needless rick in the eyes of

Copda Just at a time when she night be redired. She concluded that the

only solution appeared to be kontreal where she could go without arousing

suspicion (she commented that Cepeda had told her that be intended to

visit Canada in the near future). She felt she could reduce some of the

expense by traveling part way by bus. (hother tho ght that has occurred

to kowton is that she might travel via Havana, although he bas

Tot

as yet

mentioned this to either LIRING/4 or LIRIRG/3).

11. During the meeting LIRING/4 presented Rowton with the "Acta Notorial"

which LIRING/3 had mentioned to rowton that same morning. She said that

IIFING/3 had asked her to show the document to Rowton whiche he already

knew about. Roston took one of the thrce copies and told LIRING/4 that

he would study it at his leasure. The document is issued in apparently

proper legal form by Judge Rogelio Sanchez F., Secretary of the Civil Court

of the Third tribunal of the first Instucne of the Judicial Disticit of

Monclava, Sabinas, Coshulla, and representa an aifidavit of Flias Piña

Diaz and Antonio Rodriguez Lozano to the effect that a certain Alberto

Zarate Vidal was born ? September, 1929 in Ejido Puente Negro of Sabinas,

the son of forique Zarate Reyes and Bertha Vidal de Zárate, but that bis

birth was not previously registered by the parents. The witnesses, Piña

and Rodriguez, stated under oath that they knew this to be a fact from

personal knowledge of the parents. In the document Ilias Piña Diaz was

described as a Monican, married, native i abasole boat gongieged i=-

dent of Mineral de Nueva Rosita, Col. San Luisite 179, Coah. Antonio Rodri

guez Lozano is described as a kexican, widower, municipal employee, native

ci Suenaventura, Coak. resident of Mineral de Nueva Rosita, Calle Dos de

Abril CK-825. Attached herewith is a copy of the affidavit for station

and Headquarters files.

has intenge dislike local employees and has avoided contect because of

cident but has not as yet cologized to her personally she appeared

sonal sentiments ard try etsect riconciliation. She acreed to do so in

the reason why", According TIATiC/3, breu taliced with hir trivately

on 26 April and explained he personally had nothing against LIiTrG/3 or

brought ur Julian Lonez case, apparently as example, but screed with

LIRING/3 eat he had acted in best interests Cuba. Abreu also insinvated

that Cepeda was bostile elsment (TIRI 6/3 acinted out to Rowton for first

time that then IIRING/4 told Ambassador off some six months ago re delay

just how sophisticated and reliable LIRING-3 and company

were, that is, whether or not LIBING-3 night be working for

the opposition.

This point might not have come through

clearly in Li- 15337,

20 March 1967, and if so, we would

like to take this opportunity to emphasize that one of thu

reasons we have been following this involved case so closely

RECALE

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

Forwarded herewith as Attachment One are five reports

prepared by liallace B.

ROWTON on the LIRING-3 operation.

These

repurts are dated 13, 19, 22 (two reports) and 24 April 1967.

6 April, LIFEAT coverage of LIRING-3'S apartment ras started on

A review of the LIFEAT take

for the period of 6 to 12

April indicated to ROWTON that LIRING-3 may not have been telling

him the truth on a number of minor points.

One of these was

weather or not polonin "TOIAS,

the Magun tarado lamper who can

provide false birth certificates (on the basis of which Mexican

passports can later be obtained), exists.

ROWTON took up the question

of the lawyer and other points dealing with Enrique MORALES

and "GARCIA" with LIRING-3.

The latter appeared crushed that

ROWTON. had doubts about the sincerity of some of his statements.

He swore that the lawyer really exists and offercd to give

ROWTON all pertinent details of his next meeting with "GARCIA"

so that ROWION

can have a look at the Guatemalan "from a distance."

Such an arrangement should greatly

admitted that his wife was becoming zore and more

upset about his "clandestine" activities, and that his relations

with the Cubans were at a low point.

ROWTON on 19 April, when the above was discussed, the LIEMBRACE

team followed LIRING=3 from his old house (row used for

meetings with ROWTON) directly to the Cuban Embassy. LIRING-3

only stayed there about five minutes,

however, and

later volunteered

the fact that he briefly visited the Enbassy to ROWTON, glying a

satisfactory explanation.

A review of the LIFEAT take from 12 to 19 April showed

that LIRING-3 had deceived ROWTON on a couple of additional

points.

One of these was that LIRING-3 called his Honduran friend

Rene OCHOA in Cuba,

when he told ROWTON that he phoned Arnol

RODRIGUEZ.

Faced with

the fact that the number he called was not

Arnol's (ROWTON pays LIRING-3's phone bills), LIRING-3 said that

OCHOA was the best friend he had in Cuba and

admitted that he

had not been in contact with RODRIGUEZ for some time.

As can

be

seen from his reports, a major effort was made by ROWTON to

convince LIRING-3 and

especially his wife that the two should

take the initiative and make an effort to improve their relations

with the Cubans in general and the personnel of the local Cuban

Embassy in particular.

It became evident in the process that

his lack of good relations with the Cubans has been bothering

LIRING-3 and has been partly responsible for his depressed moods

which,

upset his wife.

The latter is particularly

disgusted with

In turi,the people in the Cuban Embassy for what she con

siders

the poor treatment they

gave her husband prior to the

latter's last trio

to Cuba (Headquarters will recall that she was

fired at that time for

telling off the Cuban Ambassador).

There is little question that ROWTON played his cards

well with LIRING-3 and especially his wife who agreed to reestablish

contact with the local Cubans to help RONTON and her husband.

can be seen from ROWTON's last report, the Cubans were quick to

seize the opportunity to develop better relations with LIRING 3'g

wife and, through her, LIRING-3:

The latter was having

lunch with

Ramiro Abreau Padron on 26 April as this dispatr.: was being.

Enrique VORALES, meanwhile, is in Guatemala to receive

instruction in the art of making plastic flowers from Angelo

ARVANITIS.

He carried with him a letter of introduction written

by LIRING7.

It was necessary to clinch the plastic flower deal

which will

serve to cover LIRING-3's activities with the Guatemalan

to use LIRING7 to vouch for LIRING-3 with Angelo

ARVANITIS.

RONTON has been instructed, however, not to bring

LIRING-3 and LIRING? together and to pass LIRING? off simply

as a friend in the Enbassy of the nationality which ROWTON uses

in dealings with LIRING-3.

Forwarded As Attachment Two, under separate cover, is

a photocopy of a document from the Mexican Secretariat of

Gobernacion notifying LIRING-3's wife that the visa application

for her father, now in the United States, has been denied.

is not too surprising in view of the father's current nationality

and racial background.

for the Feriod S-12 Agril, 1967.

1. The LIFT take on IINIIG/3's nome wes revieved by doton for the

period 6-12 pril, 1967, and lound to be generally corroborative of II-

RING/3's reports to Rowton at their regular meetings. lany useful details

of his relatio: ship with such persons as Scrique Morsles and his nalf

brother vere revealed to Ronton and

provide valuable isi hts into the

operation. The folio inf are onton's conmonis on specific portious of

the tale that may serve to eclain emera fully:

A)Conversations ith Sarisue jorales:

lorales is the lexican recommended

to ITRING/ 3 by

awz@.examiamemotr,195/, to handle the plastic flover

business in san uriscooai.

varcia tave minists ude telepoone number

64-36-96, after having alerted iorales that iInI:/3 would be calling

for an interview. IIRING/3 described lorales as a young Mexican aged

about 35, married with a family, employed in some sort of printing

work, ara"non-politácal". Farcia haà told him that lorales was a close

personal frina but not

wittins of operational activites of FiR or of

the overell plan for the shipment of aros under cover of the plestic

floier business. ITRING/3 spole with lorales, by nage, three tines

auring the period indicated, the conversation on bash sides concerned

business arranzements beiso made by 11-1:0/3 in the north and proposea

travel by Morales to Cuatenala as well as efforts bein made by Morales

to obtain a military sorvice card and passport. All this was reported

promptly to. Rowton by TIRI: 3/3 except the details -e

the military ser-

vice card and the passport.

There was no mentio: oi Carcia, end only

one possible reference to kouton ("that man": 6/4/67: 341-1 (4.5). LI-

RIIG/3 thas told Routon that he already has told loreles that ne has

a partner in the plastic flower business with wac= he must check out

certain details.

The only points in the conversations with lorales not already known to

Rowton are references to a camera, which liorales, syparently at LIRING/3

request, looked at and checked the price ($600) in Sears Roebuck. and

to "Handbags" (Bolsas), these are probably items that üIkING/3 and

Morales are arranging to purchase in san Criatóbal at loir cost and sell

in rexico City (IINING/3 mentioned thás to Rowton at one pobat). Rowton

cannot explain the refcrence to the carers, but thinks it may be for

Garcis.

Another item not understandable to Ronton is = riference by

Morales to his having written to shrig fartinez in ian Cristóbal

and to raving seut him money for nich nolmouledgement dad not been

received. Roston is aware that 11:110/3 forierded sore noney by cable

to fartinez fon dze rental of the couse, but res not tricraed by

IIKI1G/3 of loraies' havirg also dore so. Rowica suspects this vacoey

may have been to purchase the bolsas mentioned above.

There eppears also a mysterious reference to & "house" made by Morales

on 12/4/57 that Howton carnot explain. Morales stales tout he wouid

probabl; be coina"to the house"that night. 1I:InG/3 doos aot undor-

stanà and asks," cere?" To wich Forales siarl? replies, "to the

house". IIRIiG/: replies simply, "Ch,yes." This could be a reference

to sorethino like the "Casa de las Americas" rather than a safenouse.

B) Conversation concerning the (valse) Birtace sificate: 1I.NG/3

reported to ko:ton that he had arranged throug a fuevo credo larzer

naned folando Ricias, recoamonded and intogauced to him by his hali-

brother, to ostain a birthcertificate with which he coid apply for

a false rassport.

This had been urged on hirty both ismail Sucres

de la Paz and Garcia himself to conceal travel into Cuba and Guate-

mala, IIRING/3 stated to Mouton that he had been instructed by fiojas

to appear at the Recistro Civile of lexico City and the birthcertifi-

cate would be civen to hin by an official ivertified to sim only by

number. _ IRING/3 adced that no name had as yet been detormined, since

it would be necessary for the laryer to find an unused birtacertificate.

IIrING/3 reportea that the lawyer had demanded a 2,000 peso fee and

that, since he had only 500 pesos to space, his half-brother loaned

him 1,500 pesos cri

the spot. II:ING/3 asked Forton for this amount

on 7/4/52 so that ne could reimburse his half-brother, and then on

secord thought, since it was a bit urgent, asted kowton himself to

cable the noney with the messa e "I's repayi:; the loar. Thank you".

There nay be decontion here inasmuch as in his conversacion with his

half-brother IIrmic/3 stales "Don't pay eny attention to the text,

which is 'I thair you for the loan'". lo reference is nade to a lavyer

or Rolando Riojas. Furthermore IIxINt/3 teils zis half-crocher that

he went to Recistro Civil but the certificate had not as jet arrived.

He aslis the two names of the paronts. His bali-brother roglies civing

what a pears. to be the matronymic of 1INIG/3. This makes Roston think

that perhaps the lawyer Rolindo Riojas, dospite the receint obtaired

Dy IINTals does not exist. this enn be chacred out in lueveo loredo.

dallace B. kowton Fbeting with IIKIlG/3.

1. Rowton met with iI2ING/3 on 19 April, 9567, fron about 1810 until

1930 in the ratubaja apartuent. Roston case to the meetine prepared

to question ilulle/3 in deteil concernir: certain apparent discrepancies

that had core to horton's atrention, priceipall? through his study of

LIBAT intercents of the

preceding week. Forton had requested a surveil-

lance of IIRS. G/3 innediately after this saeting so that ary unusual

conüacts he might raise after his bout vira zorton could be disclovered.

2. During the first part of the moeting foston permitted IlnIG/3 to

make his usual report of developments since the last meetirg. JIRJüG/3

Five hin final instructions. It was agreed that LIRIC/3 would return to

Mezico Vity on 22 or 23 April, 1957, and tint Morales ould stand by in

San Cristobal until he received word froe :IkluG/3 by phone that he could

proceed or to Guatenala City to contact agelos Arvanicis. LIRING/3 asked

Roton's permission to give Morales 1,200 resos which are required on er-

tering Guaterala and which he could use for living expenses ior the bei or

twelve day trin, doton agreed that this sould be necessary and promised

to let IJA01G/3 Iow of Arvanitis' SlA in Guatemala itty as soon as pos-

sicle, so that lcrales vould not have to waste time and money starning bi

in San Cristsbal. Louton then gave LIRI: 313 the letter of introduction

to Arvanitis witten at bis request by IlinG/? the previous evening.

3. At this point Ro:ton opened up with his questioning. lie prefaced his

remarks with a statement that he felt his experience over mary years háa

•siven him a strong intuitive sense and accustoned hin to looking carefully

at all anples of busan nature. He then staved that the affair of the birth

certificate (false) did not ring true for sone reason, e stated frankly

that he did not think that the lawyer Rolando kiojas existed and was in-

clined to believe that IIRING/3's half-brother invented this personage to

collect the fee of 2,000 pesos himself (despite the presence of a receipt

signed by Riojas). LIRING/3 appeared crusaed it this, commenting that what

to renove any doubt it his mind thut it was not a cenuine accurent as

promised is bir by alojes. Ro:ton agreed ühat this course wouid be best

for both ninecli and <121.G/3 for their own arctection.

4. Ro:ton then proceedsd to ancther matter that he stated vas bothering his.

He explaired that neither he nor 1Im: 3/3 iner alrost notsiug about Carcia

, on instance. a DSD arent working with

the Guarenalans. LIT: 0/3 excluded this, but acroed that as nuch date on

Carcia pust be collected and/or elicited as pessible. He asked kowton

whether he had succeided in Linding forcia's photograph arns the susreet

Guatenalans in the Sobernación rogues' gallery! Sowton had alleged thit he

had access to this brough criends in Governacion), then torton replied that

he haà not as yet been able to find ine richt moment, LInIC/s stated thet

ne haà a plan that sight help. de would invite Garcia to bave coffoe on

such a central struet as dan juán de latrár where there are street photo-

crapos and thus he could man e to cet a picture ior louton. Fonton quickly

discourased this explaining that it would be transparent to Carcia, ard

adding that it was not in fact necessary. He soid that it would be suffi

cient if be could it a loor it farcia at the next meeting so that he could

spot his pnoto without difficulty. lINING/3 aprecrea relieved 'at this sug-

• gestion and assured outon that he would arrange his next neeting in such

a way that Rowton could set = good look at Carcia.

5. Rowton then turned the spotlight on inrique corales, conmenting that he

did not believe the st tement by Garcia that lorales was unitting of FiR

operations. IInIlG/3 again protested but added quickly that he vas prepared

to do what doviou felt necessary to chocl: him out thorouzily. ile stated tha 1

it had never occurred to big that Morales could do in touch with the Cubans,

5. He ther steted that in all his decliars it. zowton no had acted in

but bad never fabricated unptaing. 5a then rooseded to. "confess" a nun-

ber of details that he hau neclictea to serort to Roitor. First no stated

tnat he zad been blindfolded during his first rig to Cuatemala ( when he

not have the courere to tell conton this, first because ne felt ashamed and

secondly because bo ielt roon might de unirzoinued da tie for horing

undersone this indi nity. Since be ras blindfolded he really could not

tell konton what cars and trucks he nad been transported in or with woom

he had traveled, ard ce was alad thut Roton

and not asked bim pointolank

for these details.

7. Another confession LIRIN$/3 felt consüraired to make as that during bis

"excursions" in liva arranged by the 252 on his last trip, he was aware

that every effort ias being made by the escorts to break him down physically

for some reason not quite clear to hin as yet. He stated that during the

"excursions" he was not fiven food or water (although both were consuned

by the escorts in nis

presence rather frequenily) and he iner that they

were waiting for him to ask forsuch necessities. He did not do so out of

stubbornness and rride, just to snow the Det tast he could "take it" when

requirea. LIRING/3 again explained that a strong sense of shame had pre-

vented him from relating this indignity to Roston when he reported on the

trip, and he contessed that he vas still stinging fron the humiliation and

LIRING/3 stated thet be felt it was more econocical for lorales to wait

5. 179379/3 then, in a unrestrained emotional outburst, reassured kowton

that he had never acted in bad deith with Routon and had done everything

possible to carry out his instructions. He continued that couton vas the

only person he had enough respect for to take unlimited risks (hasta la

nuerte) and he did nos know what night happen if Roton continued to show

Jack of trust in him. He repested that he would do anything to clear up

Rowton's doubts about the lavver Riojas, the birth certificate, and Garcia,

promising again to notify Mouton in advance of the time and place of his

next meeting with Garcia so that Roston could surveil the meeting and iden-

tify Garcia. He added that e had absolately no doubts about the reliability

and concuct of inrique lorales, and was certain that lorales would not make

any contacis in Guatenals other than those purely business meetings kowton

had arranged.

6. Rowton then explained that IIRING/3's wife had telephoned him after his

departure and expressed a deisre to talk with bin. LILING/3 replied that

he realized that she was very worried about his fits of depression and that

was provably what she wanted to discuss with Rowton. He felt Rowton shouid

ste her even though de had returned and recommended that Rowton do so that

afternoon between 1500 and 1900 when he explected to be away from home on

a regular visit to his children ( by his divorced wife'. Rowton agreed

and probised to meet with JIRINg/S again that evening at 2100 to discuss

fretted that the visa had not come through, sut after all it was probably

best,since he could not isagine what the imbassy people (esos niños) might

been trying to have L-3 meet Alicia to use her with the PBRUMENers

as a

Alicia, who drinks like a fish and is

under the weather, seems to have a difficult time remembering

what she tells people.

Report dated 13 April covers meetings with Alicia

ECHEVARRIA, GARCIA and Jacobo TRODR'GUEZ Padilla.

RODRIGUEZ'S

comments on the relations between tie FAR and the Yon Sosa

querrilla groups in Guatemala were cabled separately.

to be purchased fron l'etalonlástica de Cuatemala. IIVING/3 had called

Bouton's telephone ansvering service both from juevo loredo and from

his home shortly after his return to lexico on 6 April, 1907. (As usual

1I: ING/3 used the assumed name Juarez in leaving the message).

2. LINING/3 stated that he had left lie:ico City by train on the evening

o2 31 Marco, 1967, and arrived in Saltillo the folloring day. Ze tock a

bus fron there to his destivation, Sabinas, and met his hali-brother at

his home. He reviened with his half-brother the problem of octaining a

his by his friend Sergio Gonzalez Marin. Fis half-orother sucested that

they both contact a close friond of his, a cortain jercio Arche, in

Villa Acuña, who, he explained, worked as an electrical engineer in the

local radio station and knew all the ins and outs of trade, both legal

end illegal, with the U.S. He then drove IIRING/3 to Villa icuña and they

continued their discussions in the presence of Arche. The latter finally

recommended that be set up a fictitious company at once in Del Rio, Texas,

that could issue a letter guaranteeing purchase of the complete pro

duction of the factory in jan Cristóbal ( Plastiflor de San Cristóbal)

to satisiy the requirements of the Secretariat of Commerce and Industry.

he made it clear to iIRIlIG/3 that be, with the help of LIRING/3's half-

brother, would really sell the flowers through legitimate companies in

botin del Rio and llouston, Texas, but this would taie time and some bar-

Faining. iccording to LIRING/3 all three agreed to the sussestion of

Arche and the latter proceeded immedictely to Del Rio to carry out his

plan. He returned the following day and reported that he had without

difficulty recistered the fictitious cospany, baptized "Floriex Co., in

Del Rio by paying a snall (:20.00) fee, and at the same time obtained a

Fost Office Box (739) in the same city as the mailing address. 1IRIi3/3

gio Arche were progressives and sould not object io any insinuation that

his travel had political notives. His balf-brother, whom ILKING/3 des-

cribed as a "aan of action"

certificate of a lexican born in northern Mexico, on the basis of which

LIRINC/3 could obtain a military service card and passport in lexico City.

have to pay off a number of persons in the vital statistics record

¡office.

half-brother loaned hi= 1,500 resos un the spot. LINING/3 paiù riojas

lish cordial relations with the local Cuban Vission. He talked cn

several occasicas with his friend Isnail suarr? de la Faz and aired

his caagrin at the aloofness of the new Subassy employees. Isnail

cessful place a transmitter in the residence of LikING/3 which can

MEHORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT : Tape Recording of LIRING-3/ROWTON Meeting

REFERENCE: RIDIA 31310, 8 September 1967

27 March 1967

1. Subject tape consists of a 75-minute recording of

a meeting between Wallace B. ROWTON and LIRING-3 at the

LIRING-3 safehouse on 20 January 1967 (this safehouse is now

no longer being used as such but rather is a residence for

LIFING-3 and his wife).

2. Following are facts extracted from a quick run

through of the tape:

a. LIRING-3 made a long distance telephone call

to kuby SUAREZ de Rodrkgucz at telephone 30-67-04 in Havana. be

He placed the call from the safehouse phone 14-18-56.

BaKHS The call was made lustral o

connection with a possible

forthcoming trip of LIRING-3 to Havena. It was

developed

during the call that Ruby was the wife of Arnol Rodriguez

Camp'

and that their daughter was seriously ill. This information

apparently was previously known to LIRING-3 who used the

Illness as a pretext for the call. Ruby had asked

LIRING-3 to obtain medicine for the daughter which was

LIRING - 3

sent

201-798301

## Page 126

secre

known

as NECCRAN. LIRING-3 advised Ruby that he was unable

to locate any

medicine by this name and asked for the

IGOATETY

formula dt the medicine or the name of the

label producing

1t.

During the conversation LIRING-3 said that he expected

to be in

Havana within 15 to 20 days

During this neeting

ROwTON set up a 5, 000 peas rashung fand with

LIRING-3.

c. During the conversation the names Navarrete

(Carlos) and Jacobe were mentioned. It is believed that

there names referred to carlos Nonsente and Jeels Repestuct Pala,

artists and leftist friends of LIRING-3.

d. Another name was

mentioned, that of Max

SANTANA although themeing of the reference was unclear.

(Max Santane

a well-known Cuban exile in Mexico City

who was formerly a labor leader in the pre-Castro era.

He is sonewhat of a lehisble rascal and has to make

his living the best he can, but he is also the representative

of Carlos

PRIO, a former president of Cuba, in Nexico.

The CUIS bas several times expressed interest in lax

SANTANA to double agents handled by the Station.)

e. An interesting item was dropped by LIRING-3

in connection with an alleged statement by Fidel Castro

that the young Mexican Communist Party members working

In Cuba were "algo burgues". The remark was interesting

in view of the strained relations

between PCN and PC.

secret

---

## Page 127

14-00000

Secret

f. Another interesting remark dropped by LIRING-3

was that the Cuban leaders are highly unhappy "con el embasser"!

This is interesting in light of independent reports we have

had that the Cuban Ambassador was anything but a happy man

when he returned a few days ago from his two month vacation

1n Cuba.

g. Several telephone calls occurred during the

course of the seeting or just afterwards. One of these

involved an apparent inquiry by the person calling in as

to the name in which the phone was registered because

LIRING-3 said that the telephone was in the name of Naria

Sanchez. Another telephone call of interest occured during

the meeting. It was apparently made by a young lady

calling in connection with an

anticipated meeting. with

LIRING-3. As the tape ran out LIRING-3 apparently was

waiting

for the young lady's arrival.

The LIRING-3 operation, because of its scope,

Involving information bearing on Cuba,

Mexico, Guatezals,

and now possibly the Soviet Union, and because of its

promise of possibly producing important Iniormation on

Cuban/Soviet subversion-support mechanisms operating in

and through Mexico, has naturally been closely followed

b5 all Headquarters conponents concerned with these

areas.

to establish,

as precisely as

possible

and

soon as possible, a basis for judging

LIRING-3's reliability and access.

This is particularly

important in view of the apparently rapid progress

LIRING-3 18 making in creating a channel for the movement

of arms and supplies from the United States to Guatemala.

There is a very real concern felt here about our involve-

ment in the creation of this channel while we have not yet

clearly established how we could control it.

He do not

wish to find ourselves in the position of having aided the

guerrillas to receive even a small amount of weapons or

supples.

And we must guard against the possibility that

the CUIS has not been taken in, and that it is monitoring

this entire operation.

speculate on their motives for encouraging the creation

of the supply channel, we can be certain those sotives are

inimical to the interests of the United States.

So far it has not been posaible to confirm bIRING-3'a

contacts with the FAR or PGT in Guatemala or in Hexico,

the nature of his contacts with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico,

or with Cuban officials in Cuba.

We know that he bas

traveled to Guatemala, to Cuba, and has visited the Cuban

Embassy, but have only his word on

what transpired after he

at these places.

On the other hand, we bave confirmed

that he has withheld information from us, e.ß...

that his wife worked in the Cuban Embassy and

father-in-law resides in

the United States.

It is partially for this reason therefore, that

Headquarters is particularly anxious that LIRING 3' g

the difficulty of confirming LIRING-3's

accounts of contacts inside Cuba,

inside Guatemala, or

even inside the Cuban Embassy,

Headquarters sees the

LIRING-3 - Garcia contact, in the favorable operational

climate of Mexico City, as providing the opportunity to

obtain the

confirmation which is so much needed in this

operation.

While it is understood that Station is as

appreciative as is Headquarters of the importance of

identifying Garcia, we wish by this dispatch to emphasize

of urgency which we consider proper for this

identification eiior*.

We urge that the Station cousider

is also suggested,

siuce Garcia may travel to the Soviet

Union and this next meeting with LIBING 3 may be quite some

time in the future, that the Station esplore all possible

investigative means to identify Garcia which could be

Initiated without waiting for a surveillable meeting.

Possibilities which have been discussed here include:

periodic surveillance of LIRING 3; LIFEAT and LINUD

coverage of LIRING 3; passage of photos of Guatemalans

who could possibly be Garcia to Rowtoa who, if a suitable

explanation for his possession of the photos could be

devised, could show them to LIRING-3 for identification;

Including "Garcia" in a listing of allages known to be

used by FAR members, and askiny LIREBELl to Identify

the user; or, obtaining a detalled physical description

of Garcia for possible Identification by LIREBELl,

28 sebruary, 1967

Subject: lonthly report of Develo ments

in LI-I:G/3 Cperation.

1. During the month kowton continued to meet with iIkINd/3 regularly,

on an average of three times per week, for about one hour, a: the safe-

house and (later in the month, at IlAllG/3's pernajent residence. LI-

RING/3 continued to accept Rowton's guidance and diraction virtually

without onestion. Co 15 February Couton prepared the drait of a project

outlining targets and objectives in order to soliäify lubaris's relation-

ship with iIRING/3. In order to facilitate financial arrangements with

LIRING/3 a revolving fund of 5,000 pesos was given to him by Rowton to

be accounted for periodically against receipts.

2o beveio dents viva resueci ic luva:

During the reporting period IlRING/3's relationship with the Cubans

deterioratedfor reasons not as yet fully understood either by Roton

or LIRLiG/3 himself. It wiil be recalled that, following his passing

of sensitive infornation on the lopez arrest, LIRING/3 was invited

to lavena to discuss further collaboration.

Eis subsequent visit,

however, weg not as fruitful as exrected, despite the fact that he

finally net with Cienfuegos through the intervention of his friend

•Arnol Rodriguez. In lieu of a specific nissicn for the Cubans, as

both IlFIl G/3 and Rowton hoped, he was brushed off on an apparently

unimportant courercial assinment. LIXING/3 felt strongly that be

should establish

relationships witb the Guatemalan rebels on his

own (torough Jacobo Rodriquez), more or less ignoring the Cubang,

and particularly the

DSE, in the hore that the Cubans would inevi-

tably recognize

the merit of his efforts and take him into their

confidence. At Howton's urging, however, LINING/3 agreed to write

his friend Arnol Rodriguez s letter explaining nore fully his posi-

tion and inforring bim that he was in any case moving ahead with ibis

plan to selp the Guatenala: rebels. This apparently did the trick,

since Rodriguez rassed & message to him through the Cuban Ambussador

that he as invited back to lavana for further discussions. LIRING/3

expressed a great deal of self-satisfuction at this development, but

felt he should continue with the FiR representatives in order to have

more concrete data to discuss with the Cubans when he did return to

Havana. He therefore returned to Guatemala in order to advise the

FAR ropresentatives that he had succeeied In obtaining the medicine

and radio tubes they bad ori .ally asred for.

In February, however, he received word from irnol rodriguez througo

a diploatic courier that he should not return to Havana until be bad

received further instructicns from Arnol Rodriguez himself. jubse-

quently, on 15 February, LIXING/3 learned from the chauffeur of the

Cuban Loassador that Julian Lopez had alleged taat LIRIIiC/3 bad o3-

tained the information regarding his arrest from the Mexican police,

and, by insinuation,

was collaborating with the lexican authorities.

The cheuffeur added that. LIAI G/3 should be aware that there were cer-

tain elesents, including Cepeda, in the local imbassy hostile to bim.

This report led IIRING/3 to check with the Cuban Consulate re the

statuo so bio visa fauthorizo? in curio canual, lj irnol cuiriguero auù

to his surprise he learued that the visa had "run out" and would have

to be renewed in the event he desired to travel to Cuba again.

This devslopment left IIRIIS/3 perplexed and disturbed, as well as more

annoyed than ever with the bureaucratic shenanigans of

the DsE. LIMiNG/3

felt genuinely outrsted since he in his own mind had only the best of

intentions in his offer to help the Cubans and in general the revolu-

tion in Sentral imerica. IIR:NG/3's first reaction was to ignore the

Cubans completely and proceed unilaterally with lis collaboration rith

the Guatemalans. He was encouraged in this by corments made by the

FAR contact in Mexico City to the uffect that the Cubans were difficult

people to deal with and somntimes even FAR found it best to ignore them.

kowton, however, urged IINIiC/3 to redevelop more cordial relatiors

with the local mission, since any hostile elements there coula cause

him endless embarassment and annoyance. Rowton aiso advised MIRING/ 3

to continue bis development of Ismail suarez de la Paz, who appears

to have a direct channel to Arnol Rodriguez, and who himself has often

complained of the inefficiency and ineptness of the Cuban bureaucrats.

vuring the latter half of the month LIFJNG/3 made more frequent visits

to the mbassy and chatled cordially with abreu. As of 28 February, bow

over, no further message has been received from irnol Rodriguez to

clarify IIRING/3'g current relationsbip with the Cubans.

a Guatezalan telephoned IIPIlG/3 at iis residence and at the meeting

arranged for 20 February, idontified himself as the lAR liaison iho

would be seeing him nore or less re: ularly in the future.

The FAR

liaisos, who stated his nume vas Garcia, explained that he was plan-

nug a trip to the Soviet Urion in the near future, and was ansious

prior to his departure to have LIRllio/3 meet with three other comrades

preferably in San Cristöbal when the redicine and radio tubes were

being delivered. LINIUG/3 agreed to make the tric, since at the sare

time be could arrange the rental of a suitable nouse in the area for

future contacts. LIRING/3 therefore made plans to iepart with the

supplies for San Cristóbal on 1 liarch.

LIRING/3 had not informed the Cuban Embassy of his newly developed

liaison with FAR, but has indicate in a general way to irnol Rod-

riruez that he is engaged in support activities for the revolution in

Guatemala. He hopes to clarify nith the FiR more precisely what nis

own relationship with the Jubans should be with reard to their activi-

ties, especially in light of the fact that the FAk representative nas

informed him

that direct aid is now being received from the Soviets and

certain of his activities are not being made known to the Subans.

In general in his dealings ith the Cuatemalans, LINüliG/3 feels more

comfortable since his rclationship with them is uncomplicated at the

moment by such antecedents as the lopez affair. He is impressed by the

efficiency and profesional approach of fAR and in undoubtedly in.

fluenced by the relative ease with which he can roforn for them in

Mexico.

Cover ¿spects of IIRT:G/3's Uperations:

Дріії

?

During the moath of fsbruary, ILIRING/3 presented & formal request to

the Dirreción General de Comercio torough his friend Sergio Gonzalez

• Cambere Ce as

Mlos 5x1 Marin for the establisiment of a small factory to assemble the plastic

flowers produced by the Metaloplastica de Guatemala. In anticipation

of a request by the Secretariat for details and assurances that

the

flowers will be exported to the U.S. and not compete with local pro-

Who

duction, IIRI G/3 re-established contact with his half-brother who

lives in Sabenas and has excellent coumurcial contacts with firms in

San Antonio, in the hope of solllulting his help in finding an Anerican!

importer who will contract to purchase the entire pooduction of the

factory once it is set up in lexico. At the same time LIRING/3, on

Rowton's suggestion, will investigate the possibility of establishing

---

## Page 158

a modest factory in the house he plans to rent in San Uristóbal.

Negotiations with local

authorities in that area

would be much simpler

thün in Mexico üity and at the same tine the factory would provide

excellent cover for the sufehouse.

If and when the flower project materializes, arrangements can easily

be made by IIRING/? to have the first shinent sent from Guatcuala

City by truck to San Cristóbal. A qualified l'exican can likewise be

sent to learn the technical details of assembly at the retuloplastica

plant in Guetenala City.

The entire commercial cover plan has been accepted enthusiastidally by

FAR since it presents to them the inviting prospect of a viable legal

network operating from texas to Guatemala City. LiRING/3 reazizes the

delicacy of the future relationship with retaloplastica and IIRING/7

and has jirioci ic coiurtaont as nuch se pnesible. at least for the

present, his activities on benalf oi FiR from those of a purely com-

mercial nastare.

3. During the month it was necessary for IIRING/3 to nove his funily ilto

the safehouse, which he had rented in his orn name, in order to disabuse

the landlady of her growins suspicions that the apartment was being used

for some unorthodox purpose. IINIFG/3 explaired to the landlady that he

had been having some domestic problems vith his iife, but that things had

been patched up and that tbey were now able to resume their married life

together. this has apparently satisfied the curiosity of the landlady..

Anotber safchouse, under cover of an art studio, will ve located for fu-

ture meetings between jIRING/3 and Rowton. The oricinal plan to noritor

the safehouse from the apartment below has been abandoned in view of the

undesirability if the couple currently residing in the proposed uP.

LIRING/ 3 - Norris K. UTHLETT Chronology

Carlos JURADO Delmar, a Nexican artist and existentialist,

is an unvitting ifformant who has lexican far leftist political

convictions.. He has been assessed by his handler as unfriendly to

the U.S, and not a candidate for recruitzent. JURADO's wife, Mirian

CHICHAY, a Chinese-Cuban, worked in the Cuban Embassy in lexico City

until November 1966 for LIPING/1 and LIRING/2. RONTON /retends to

be a Greek businessman interested in developing lucrative, semi-legal

husiness with Cuba. JRAND may have the impression that prime is

really somehow connected with Soviet intelligence - a notion ROTTON

crites.

has not attempted to disabna

He has convinced JURADO

that to be successful the two of them must be fully aware of all the

realities of Cuban politics and commerce. JURADO, kho lived in Cuba

for a couple of years follering CASTPO's accession, has maintained

friendships with some well-placed contacts in Cuba. He has made

three trips to Havana in connection with his relationships with

RONTON, Who obtains information from JRADO by eliciting and direct

questioning.

As à result of the injection of #TADO by Station Mexico

City into the sensational JULIAN LOPEZ Diaz/Guatemalan Aris Suggling

case, JURADO was asked by the Cuban Embassy to Help the rOC with their

sensitive adtivitées in Mexico and to go to lavana for

a briefing

on shat he cAuld do. To inject JURADO into the case, Station Mexico

City furnished him with some theretofore undisclosed information on

-/-

## Page 189

the arrest by ''exican authorities of LOPEZ Diab, a Cuban diplomat, Thi

• allegedly esses from a Cuatemalan reporter who had obtained it fros

a member of the Guatemalan Communist party. In Havana, JRADO

discussed the case at length with his friend and contact, Arnol

RODRIGUEZ Camps, a fomer Vice-Vinister in the cuban Foreign Ministry.

He also told RODRIGUEZ details of a plan to form his l'exican and

Central American contacts into a network which could support clandestines

Cuban operations. RODRIGUEZ appeared to be. impressed, according

tO JURADO's story, and introduced JURADO to Osmani CIENFLECOS, Chairman

of the Foreign Affairs Conmittce of the Central Cormittee of the Cuban

Carmunist Party (the body charged with the responsibility for

impietenting Cuban subversion in latin marion,), JDAM ronnrted

that CIENFUECOS expressed appreciation for JURADO's offer of assistance and

stated that Cuba is interested in exporting subversion to Central

America to harass the inited States,*

CIENFUEGOS reportedly went on to say that the tubanstrustral JURADO

but not his contacts about whon they know nothing. He further

explained that one untrustworthy link could blow the entire effortt

and and then suggested that JiT'ADO be given the opportunity to test the

sincerity of his contects, RODRIGUEZ reportedly suggested that

JURADO arrange a deal to barter Cuban Nickel ore for weed killer.

(Cuban Nickel ore is already being offered in Mexico by other dealers and

Mexican-made weed killer is readily available

on the open market

in Mexico).

---

## Page 190

Despite leadquarters suggestions that JURADO go slowly in setting

up his support net to the Guatemalan guerrillas, Eas RONTON sett him

to establish contact isit with them on the 'erican/Guatenalan border

in early Decenber 1966. JURADO established contact with a mah in

Mexico City who gave him a letter ci introduction to a woman in (uatemala

City. The woman was to carry the letter to Cesar MONTES, Guatemalan

guerrilla leader and explain thut he could wif trust JURADO and should

take advantage of his offer. At the same time JURADO sent a letter to

RODRIGUEZ in lavana explaining that he boald not make his comercial

contact witting of any ars passed through the proposed channel.

lie also sent intomation on weed jiliors and roquested details

for possibly consumating the deal.

In mid-December JUR/DO again traveled to a town on the

Mexicana side of the Guatemalan border and contacted the guerrilla

representatives. He reported that he was taken "black" across the

border to Cuatemala City where the guerrillas told him of some of

their problens in obtaining material, specifically & mentioning their

need for some radio tubes and mecical supplies. JURADO committed

himself to providing those items along with a concrete proposal for

regular contact.

The guerrillas reportedly told JURADO that they

could handle the goods from the Mexican side of the border to their base

camp in Guatemala®

At this point the l'exico City Station proposed to mount a

paralles operation involving Norris K.UMILETT, a 33 year old Greek

who was recruited in 1952 by #CYTON to penetrate the U.S., Creek, and

Cuban Communist Parties, UPHLETT perfoened adequately inthese tasks

including aif but the last two years of ever five spent in Cuba.

PONTON sent IMPHLETT to quatemala in late Fehruary 1966 on a

"business development" trip to estatlish contact vith elements who

could be used as support elements for subversion including clandestine

resupply of guerrilla groups harlier thei,..

It was propsoed that these elements would

be offered to the CUIS entas

she Greek Conmumist ons a chodolate factory isi Caterala

city where he has narivised leftists in elains in he malated to

an EDA deputy in Athens. UMMILETT is to exploit this relationship

in an effort to land a job in the husiness as a cover to assist the

Greek in clandestine activity.

In nid-January 1967 JITADO reported that the Cuban Ambassador had

called him aside at a party to teil him that RonIcus? cabled the

Embassy to request JIADO's presence in Cuba for additional descussions.

Rather than jump on Havana's cormand, JURADO called RODRIMEZ to

infom him he would have to make another trip to luatemala first.

JURADO reported that he was approached by another Cuatemala Commist

who claimed, in confidence, that he was part of the FAR network

in Mexico and had been advised that massive Soviet aid (in excess

of: $200.000)

was available to the FAR "directly" but with qualifications

that nould in effect place the FAR under complete Soviet control. He

explained that it was for this reason that the FAR was raising funds

on its own by such neans as bank and train rotheries, in Central America.

At the end of Janumay JPADO reported he had made contact

with the FAR representatives in ruatemala City and had rade arrangements

for pernanent liaison in lexico City and Havana. He was given contact

instructics, which sould he initiated by the FAR representatives, and was *cel

satst to passthe suppleis (that he had comitted hinself to

providing) to the contact man in 'exico City.

A special enoy from Cuba visited JURADO the day after he

returned from Guatemala for the ostensible purpose of passing on

some advise and guidance of a security nature. RO:TN speculated that the

Cuhans - particularly RODRICUEZ - were afraid JURADO had taken offense

at their treatment of him on his last ixited visit to Auha, and sent

someone to salve his feelings. The envoy gave JURADO a lot of advice on how

to handle himself with respect to the Cuban Embassy persornel,

American intelligence, and on security and tradecraft in gereral.

On 15 February lEPRERA, the Cuban Embassy chauffeur anda

friend of JUFADD, met with the agent to tell him some rumors he

had heard involving JRADO including

the statement that there were

certain "hostile elements" toward JURADO in the Embassy. RETON

cautioned JURADO not to be too aloof with the Embassy causing them

to react unfavorabley toward him for no reason offter threr than

that they were out of touch with him.

On 20 February "Carcia" the FAT representative in "exsegit

set up a beeting with JPADO but acredd that JRAns plan to taken pared in

the goods to the lexican/ruatemalan border was better than lexico

City because of "the incredible network of agents run by the North

Americars throughout the city." He said that the FAR didn't have an

urgent need for the supplies because they were adequately supplied

by the Soviets and Cubans but that the FAR had no objections to

JURADO dealing with Yon Spsa's 5-13" Noverber which is not so well

supplied. "Garcia" said he was scheduled to travel to the soviet

Union and wanted to discuss fall the aspects of Jaila support

operation so that aftivies could nove ahead in his absence. "Carcia"

contrasted the "bother" of dealing with the Cubans with the sie thiece of

relations with the Soviets.

On 2 March JURADO traveled tothe Mexico/Guatemala border

part of

town of San Cristobal to deliver/the su supplies to the representatives

of the FAR guerrillas. "Carcia" showed up and he and JURADO went

to a thon nearet-the Guatemalan border where they transferred the

goods, "Garcia" said he would take possession of the refrigerated

drugs in l'exico City after returning from the USSR. The FAR rep-

resentatives explained, they had a fairly god network in Texas for

the acquisition of arms but were having trouble transporting them.

They indicated JURADO's plan kas better than arything they have going

and would probably adopt it. Before he left for ISSR, "Garciz"

called JRADO to tell him that Cesar MONTES and Yon SOSA had patched

up their differences and the Guatemalan guerrilal rovement would move ahead

faster now.

AXLYSIS AND COgENTS

INTENT OF TIE OPERATION: To provide inforantion: * Cuatemalan

insurgency; Cuban - and perhaps - Soviet support of subversion

in Guatenala; the use of exico by the Cubans and Soviets

to support Guatemalan insurgency; identify people, pin-point

locations, and estahlish metliods of operation of insurgents

and their support nterorks in fuatemala and Mexico.

i. ESTABLISIMENT OF SUPPLY NETORK - PATON is having

LIRING/3 establish a supply network in l'exico and fusionale to pass

materiel to the insurgents in Guatemala. The supplies could

originate in either the U.S., Cu:a, or by sea from any countrie

In doing this, members of existing support networks are not being

idertified - only the aliases of some of LIRINt/3's contacts.

This network could bery well operate parallel to other such channels

and he would not learn any nore than we are learning now. In fact,

we could conceivably assist fuatemalan insurgency and get little

or nothing in return -- and should the operation go awry this agency

would be hard put toexplain the circunstances. You can be sure the

leftints would have a field day, We are not adverse to providing

some naterial as long as le get something in returt.

## Page 195

Z0. "IRINE/3'& REPORTINA - None of the ifformation LIRINf/3

has reported has been corrohorated by other sources. Only the

existence and presence of some of the contacts has been coffirmed by

technical operations at the Station, but not the infornation. So

far we, and RONTON, have no choice but to beléeve most of what

LIRING/3 tells us. [four's capability in the Spanish language is

only adequate and one taped meeting showed that LIRIW/3 spole right

ovor ROVION and domianted the conversation. i It is conceivable that

LIRING/3 is controlling the entite operation and that PANTON

is not able to discern this. Also, because of the unusual nature of

their relationship and Ramuse caver pAm is not ablo to question

LIRING/3 tood deeply in some areas and not at all in others. And

we are assuming that RONTON's cover is effective.

art: thin

may nee

correctio

30 SURVEILLANCE: - The LIRING/3 operation has teen going

for over a year now and the only surveillance of the agent has been

an abortive attempt at tapping his telephone and an audio device

in the safehouse in which he. and his wife are now living. His phone

should be tapped constantly, his mail should be intercepted and read, he

should be survéilled for a couple of weeks to establish his pattern

of activities, photographs should be taken of him and his contacts,

and he should be investigated to find out where his money comes

from, where it goes, what his wife does all day, etc.

---

## Page 196

4. SUMARY - After a ye, the operation is oot paying off

as it should and the agency and ROWTON

are cormitted to a situation

that could hackfire in

several ways.

Steps should be taken soon to confirm

LIRINC/3's access and information and to establish beyond the

shadow of a douht his bona fide. Headquarters is not at all convinced

that 1)

LIRINC/3 believes ROUTON's cover story, 2) That LTRIN^/3

is in contact wilith the FAR, 3)

that the opposition is not playing

WOrACT for a sucker.
