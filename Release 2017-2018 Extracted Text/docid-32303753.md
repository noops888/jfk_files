the five "bosses"

carefully screen these lists for questionable members

who would be checked on the list.

Those members checked would be eliminated from

the organization and the "families" reformed.

Those to be eliminated would be told they were

no longer members and would be free to go about their

own business, but warned not to ever divulge any information

regarding

"La Causa Nostra."
