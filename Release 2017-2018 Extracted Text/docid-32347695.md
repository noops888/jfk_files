REF: DIRECTOR 231844

1. INSTRUCTIONS REITERATED BY HOS IN REF REPEATED TO MR.

CORNWELL AFTERNOON 1 JUNE, IT APPEARS THAT HE NOW UNDERSTANDS

GUIDELINES.

HE HAS ASKED FOR READING ON MANUEL JOSEPH ALVAREZ DURANT.

PLEASE PROVIDE IMMEDIATE GUIDANCE AND TRACES ON THIS PERSON.

3.

MR. CORNWELL SAYS MEXICAN AUTHORITIES ARE BEING VERY

COOPERATIVE. ONE HOOKER, HOWEVER, THROWN AT COS BY MR. CORNWELL

AND THAT IS HE ASKED WHAT IF LEADS PROVIDED BY MEXICANS SHOULD

INCLUDE SOME OF THE PROHIBITED PERSONS TO BE INTERVIEWED..

IT

AGREED AND COS SEES NO WAY OUT THAT MR. CORNWELL COULD NOT TELL THE

MEXICANS HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN CERTAIN PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS.

THIS WOULD BE A POSSIBLE TIPOFF OF U.S.

GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS

WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS. SPECULATE THAT THIS COULD ALSO BE A WAY

CORNEWELL AND COMPANY COULD GET AROUND PROMIBITIONS. EZ IMPDET.
