NY 100-107383

It is to be noted that to date, the subject's checking

account at the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company, Grove and West

Fourth Streets, NY, Ny, does not show that the subject wrote a

check for his ticket to Milan.

This, coupled with the fact that

he refused to give Alitalia an address or telephone number where

he could be reached, seems to indicate that he did not want his

trip to Europe to become known.

The Bureau is requested, through Legat, Rome, to determine,

If possible, the subject's activities in Milan, Italy.

It is also

requested that it be determined if TANG Ming-chou, also known as

CHU TONG, an Official of the People's Republic China, was in Milan

at the same time as the subject.(5)

It is also requested that the Bureau point out to the

Legat, Rome, that itiwas reliably reported that in September, 1963,

the subject

contacted lANG Ming-chou in London,

and that it

has

also been reported that TANG is in charge of Political Intelligence

for the People's Republic of China as it pertains to English-speaking

countries.

When the records become available at INS, NY pertaining

to arrivals about 5/19 or 20/64, these records will

be reviewed to

determine

subjectis method of return to the United States.
