A. I am asking you, from the point of view or a counterintelligence

officer, hou do you (evaluate:) ((this)).

B. And I do not intend to resolve the question of my life on ((to confor»

B. How, thy are you turning this around

That is not richt.

In 1953, 1931, 1935 and 1956, I really vas nothing; I vas only a case

officer.

If you are talking about 1954, you arc right.

A. Yes.

B. Right; what do you want me to tell you - that in 1954 they valued me

and liked me and respected me.

A. Oh, do you renember, in the boginning, in the beginning, when you

A. That is the Personnel record sheet:

That kind of document is it'

B. I do not know;

A. Tell, on every Party menber and every Konsonol menber vorking in the

organs of the iVD or in government fork, or even i non-Party neuber

having sone higher education or qualifications and on whom there is a

personnel file in the KGB or the Council of Ministers or the CC CPSU

A. It is not vory important to the IVD, but - in accordance with a CC CPSU

decision - very employce illls it out.

B. I do not inor, I do not know

A. It represents a true picture of the cducated emplorees.

B. that roes into it:

A. Tucre is the usunl incornation in it, but I do not rant to explain

that there is.

B. I do not inow, I do not know.

A. It begins vitis the questions - surnane, iirst nose, patronynic; date

and place of birth; social background; curation of Party acabership;

party Identification card number.

This shoet is, as tacy say, a Party-ionsonol record; It is completed

by each caployce; it is included in the Personal file before the

antieta.

B. I absolutely do not renenber tais sheet or its conpletion, absolutely.

A. This, again, is one of the proofs that forces the conclusion that....

B. Honest, I absolutely do not renember this sheet or its completion t the

Personal files into which I looked.

I looked into Personnel files.

Because in 1962, 1963, ve hired for the Third Section, restaurants and

A. I an not astlug because anyone rants to inow this number; but there

is a procedure in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union -- every

nember of tho party is obliged to inow the nunber of his Party card.

((NG; d and B speak at the same tine))

it is not written ((in the Regulations)), but there is a procedure and

still renenber it.

I do nos recall my Komsonol card number.

I do not know whether I inew it vell; probably I did.

But I remember my Party card number -- and that was nore than 20 years

ago.

B. Loo's - just a minute; there is another number - every employee has

a serial number (lichnyy nomer); it is a metal plate.

You keep it in the safe.

This nunber is indicated in the identification card which you carry

with you every day, day and night.

I do not remember it, but I know it had four digits: "Ye00, and then

the number.

A. Of course, no one ever asked you to remember the number of your

identification card.

B. No, this is not the identification card number; this

is a serial nunber.

For what purpose is It.

simplest question about the number, and you do not linor

"ell, very well; let us take this line -- how tany Party cards have you

had altogether.

B. A candidate nembership card in 1036; when I was accepted in 1957, a

cembership card; that is all.

A. Then was the Party card exchange.

B. Toat was before I was accepted, in 1955 or 1954.

A, At that time, did you receive a new Party card

B. Hell, this was before my time.

In 1956, I received a candidate nemiership card and in 1957, a member-

ship card; it vas before my acceptance into the Party, in 195g or 1331.

A. Here there any other circumstances under which you exchanged....:

B. The card.

No.

Where did you leave your card when you left.

B. In the safe... no, no; I lied - I left it with the Secretary of the

P. The old day ins passed; a new day - the t33rd - has begun.

й. 133г€.

D. 403гd.

May I have a cicarette.

A. You stfil have not iorgotten how to count the days.

B. I count on my fingers; hesides that, I take threads from my blanket and

nake numbers.

For instance, the first of July; the next day Is the secoad of July.

From the preceding number, I naic a new number every day; that is how

I count.

1. That other reans of counting do you have

You can lose yourself that way.

B. No; there is a whole number of ways.

I save every day, every munth.

The guard detail changes every Friday - that is exactly a reek; new

guards come.

I am telling you -- I do not count:

one, two, etc.

Fen I get to 365, it makes a year, and I begin again.

When I get to 400 = it was on the 3th

of

May. - and I began agaln,

because on the 8th of May it was exactly 400 days..

And, besides that, there are these numbers that I make from the threads.

A. But do you not make any other marks.

B. No; well, I did one time - I put scratches on the door: the ist of

That is how.

A. well, perhaps ve should return to our discussion about the consonol.

I do not thin's that we have covered crorything; we did not agrec with

each other cverywhere.

Do you still insist that you more Sceretary of the ko:sorol organization

Tell ue, as a friend to frirnd, mere jou were.

B. What would I get out of it ((to tell lies))

Neither a minus, nor a plus.

A. I would not get anything out of it.

B. No, ne, not you - I am talking about myself, about my biography, my

activities; this would rive no neither a plus, nor a minus.

A. You know, we have sposen about the ronsonol - we have spoisen about

this matter twice; and I want to talk about this subject for the last

time.

The konsonol does not operate the way you described it.

If a person were Secretary of a konsonol organization, he rould know

more than the rani-and-file Konsonol member; ((but)) I an not asking

to answer as a Secretary of a ((Konsonol)) Committee.

B. I do not rerember the nane of the Connittee Secretary.

A. Hell, let us say, the Secretary of a Konsonol organization in the most

important directorate in the IVD - in counterintelligence, or the

Second Directorate, as you want to call it - if he were the Secretary,

as you say, for approximately a year, he would have had sone kind of

contact with the Secretary of the ((junsonol)) Committee of the VD,

simply because of his Konsonol work.

B. There was, there ras, there mas... because I....

1. You probably selected delegates fron your konsonol organization, and

you yourself as Secretary should have attended it.

B. Of course, of course.

A. Hell, tell me about tis conference; you probably saw the Secretary and

gave hin documents on those mion you had sclected to be celegates to

this conference, and so forth; a great deal of preparatory work had to

be carried out.

B. I do not rouember; I do not even remenber what tas discussed at tie

conferences; of course, there vere conferences or neetings of the altiv,

A. l'ell, I an not asking what ms discussed; I am just asiing about the

procedure.

You say you do not remember the nane of the secretary of the lVD

Konsomol Conmittee; in my opinion, you should know; if you were the

Secretary of the Konsonol organization of the Sccond Chief Directorate

you had to know.

B.

I do not know; why do not I know.

Because, after

all, he was not a star in the sky.

B. I do not remember it.

A. Nell, I will remind you shout this great event - it vas just at the

tise men you were Secretary, and it was quite important -- it was the

Moscow City Konsonol Conference in February 1951, vich delegates vere

clected fros all konsorol organizations, including the lVD or the kGs,

whatever you mut to call it; and you, of course, as a Secretary had

to take an active part in it - to he it the aitiv mootins of the e

Kossoaol, to select candidates, and perhaps even to malic a speech.

Even if you did not deliver a speech at least you had to be there and

to vote, etc.

B. I do not remember.

A. This was your last konsomol position while you were working, in the

"VD or anymere else, and I think you should remember it.

Well, as you told me last tine, a konsonol member can be any person of

that age.

1. Are you sure of this.

B. Ycs.

A. Well, you can laagine that a Scerotary must know.

B. Until the age of 27.

A. 27:

for 1949.

((Pause)) I will read you a paragraph from the Konsomol Reculations

B. Thy 1949.

This was in 1953-1954.... 1949.

A.

Just before this, I asked you wart important event took place in

March 1954.

B. I do not remesber this.

A. There was a Konsonol Congress....

B. There were such... it was not the only one.

A. ...At which new reguiations were adopted.

It was not the only one, but it was the next one after 1949, the next

one.

From. 1949 until this Congress, they lived according to these regulations,

but from 1954 they began to live differently.

Hone of the regulations before 1949, after 1949, or after 1954 said

anything about "up to 27 years of age".

From Komsomol'skaya Pravda, 7 April 1949: "Anyone from the age of 11

to 26 can be a member of the VLxsa...."

Anotner Congress took place, 30 March 1954:

"Anyone fron the

age of 14

SECRE

## Page 19

104-10210-10029

to 26 can be a nether of the VLKS'l...." -- this mas in 1059.

Further, zere are other Reculations, published in lioscon in 1333:

"Anyone fron the age of li to 25 can be a nember nf tan VLis:...." --

this was men they changed the Regulations.

rever in the history of the lonsool, besinning in 1919, have the

regulations anywere said anything shout "up to 27 years of age"; it

alway's was "up to 26" and toon they chanted it to "up to 29".

15. (2G) I lot for roason of ago in 10so. (34?)

A. I do not want to argue.

You could have leit for reason of age when you vore 27 years old; I

do not at all deny this - I only an reminding you that jesterday you

insisted that the Rogulations say "up to 27, and that is all"

I did not argue with you then; I sinply told you that it never was "up

to 27"; it vas "up to 26".

And now... I do not know whai reason you had, etc.; I have only one

question - did they malie sone sort of exception for you.

B. They did not naie any kind of exception for me.

A. Then what is the natter.

A secretary has to brow' -- right

What do you thin's -- the Secretary of the lonsumol Organization of. the

Second Chief Directorate; all of Soviet counterintelligence was working

taere, and he does not know that, at the time wen he was Sacretary,

a Komsomol Congress took place, and new Regulations vere adopted.

B. I do not remember.

A. It was a big event; a Congress does not take place every year.

"By the way, how often are homsonol Congresses held

B. I do not renember.

.::

A. Well, just between us, do you thin' there is basis for me to believe

SECRET

## Page 20

104-10210-10029

that you were a Secretary.

B. I cannot tell you anything nore about this; I sisaly do rot renember.

A. "I do not rouenver" a this is not the anster of a counterintelli.ence

officor; use can answer "I do not remember" to all questions.

B. A counterintelligence officer is not God.

He is just like any other man -- IVaiCY, PITROY, SIDOROV -- vorking in a

shop or sosochore cise; the only difference is tat he is vorking in

counterin: llicence, and the other, ir a shop.

A. You know, if jc, vere a Secretary of tae konsonol organization of a

crutch factory, I would not as! you such quastions, because the

Secretary of the Konsonol organization of a crutca factory could jorget •

but an coplojec of counterintelligence, of the Second Chief Directorate,

could not jorget this, not hecausc ze was Secretary or a komsomol

neaber, but hecause this is the daily vor:: of a countcrintelligence

officer: to now all of the legulatiors, because he is working with

peoplo; he recruits, he devolors, de arrests, etc.; he has business witi

the consonol and with the Party every day.

B. Right.

A. Tiell, ho comes in contact with the Regulations and with other docusents

and instructions -- this is my I told you, "This is not the answer

of a counterintelligence officer"; he should knor nore than a siaple

kolkhor worser or a member of a

Do you want me to find the too:let ((regulations)) and bring it to you.

B. No; the entrance dues were the sane as the monthly dues -- two percent

of the pay.

A. That are entrance dues:

B. The first dues you pay upon entering the Konsonol.

You pay it once; the usual you pay every month.

A.

There vere special instruction of the CC VLKSM on the collection of

membership dues, which were sent to all Komsonol organizations, and

until the nost recent Regulations the scale was not given, except the

entrance dues - two percent.

Here, in one ((set of)) Regulations, it is written: "Entrance dues are

taken upon entrance into the Komsonol - two percent of the monthly

salary.

Fron Konsonol members who do not receive a monthly salary, entrance dues

are taken in accordance with the instructions of the CC VLKSM."

Of course, he could jorget something, but it is nonsense to insist upon
