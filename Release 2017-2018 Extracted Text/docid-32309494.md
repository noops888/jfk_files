HEMMING were interviewed separately concerning contents

of Kansas City letter.(#)u)

Concerning Paragraph 1, page 2 of enclosure,

Informant and HEMMING advised that INTERPEN never had

more than 25 members. Its training camp was located

some forty miles west of Miami, and no ammunition or any

type of weapon whatsoever was ever at the training camp. (C.)

HEMMING said that someone had a Bowie knife at the camp,

and this was the only thing that could be classified as

a weapon. (KYu)

Concerning Paragraph 2, page 2, Informant and

HEMMING advised INTERPEN never had any airplanes of any

type and that a B-47 is a high altitude jet bomber used

by the United States Air Force, costs millions of dollars

and is not available to the public.

Only l two parachute practices were held, one

on June 24, 1961, in which /Informant flew the plane, and

HEMMING, JOE GARMAN, DICK WORLEY and FRANK LITTLE jumped.

On June 27, 1961, Informant again rented an

airplane,

and HEMMING, GARMAN, DICK WATLEY, ORLANDO GARCIA

and FRANK LITTLE jumped.

(C) Concerning Paragraph 3, page 2, both Informant

and Hemming advised that AUGUSTIN CAPO had a boat. #CIA

furnished money for him to buy radio equipment, but he

never left Miami with it. Investigation reflected that

CIA wanted CAPO stopped.

and CAPO never left Miami.

U.S, Border Patrol was notified, EXIL(L

The boat was not a PT boat,

and it was later repossessed by a creditor. CAPO never

had any arms.

There is no reason to believe HEMMING is a

double agent.

PLATZ's opinion appears to be as incorrect

as the information he furnished. Informant said he had

never heard of PLAIZ, who was never in charge of anything

fOr INTERPEN, and never made any parachute jumps with

INTERPEN.

HEMMING advised that PLATZ came to Miami in

about March, 1961, worked with JAMES GENTRY, an American

soldier of fortune, in a junk yard for about a month and

a half. PLATZ went to the INTERPEN training camp, spent

one day, returned to Miami, and was never associated with

INTERPEN; was never a member, and made no parachute jumps.

He never participated in INTERPEN's activities.

HEMMING described PLATZ as an alcoholic, who

drinks up to two bottles of vodka a day, who has a repu-

tation for fighting in bars, and is completely unreliable.

PLAIZ spent the one day at INTERPEN training camp some

time in the middle of May, 1961. He was seen by HEMMING

the last time about five or six weeks ago in a cheap bar

and in a drunken condition.

WIne Bureau will note that MM 639-s 1s In close

contact with INTERPEN and HEMMING and has been_ reporting

daily on INTERPEN's activities since May, 19617$)Ä11

information concerning INTERPEN activities has been fully

reported to the Bureau, and information furnished by PLATZ

is considered to be completely unreliable.
