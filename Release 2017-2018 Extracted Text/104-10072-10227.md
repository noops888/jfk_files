Introduction

AMCIOCK/I arrived in New York on 19 Septenber 1967. He

failed to call soon after his arrival

it was decided to try to establish visual contact with him at HTBASTE,

same as was done successfully in 1966, to move him to call for contact

instructions.

For that

purpose DI GERVENO WaS taken to HTBASTE On

21 September carrying a match folder from Iden Biwith his alias, iden C,

and room number.

The plan was to make sure AMCLOCK/1 recognized

DI GERVENO, who also met him in 1966,

and to pass the match folder

to AMADCK/l only if this could be done securely.

DI GERVENO was

able to make definite visual contact on four different occasions:

once atIden D, twice at liden E"and a fourth time on the corridor

between Oden D'and (Iden &

AMCLOCK/1 quickly recognized DI GERVENO

and tried to keep himsel available for a possible contact. However

this was not possible and

the contacts on 21 September were limited

to visual recognition only:

1685

2 .

During this time the operational number of the Beekman site

(Iden G)'was also manned in case AMCLOCK/1 had

retained this number

and attempted to call DI GERVENO there instead of IMWAVE, but he

failed to cali either place for contact instructions.

It was then

decided to attempt to contact the agent again on 26 September at

HTBASTE.

While attempts were being made to locate AMCLOCK/1

the

case officer surveilled the building where AMCLOCK/l is staying

(Iden

and saw him go in by himsels at 1310 houns to leave his briefcase.

At 1330 hours, AMCLOCK/L left the building alone to go for lunch and

DI GERVENO followed him.

AMCLOCK/l recognized the case officer and

after exchanging safety signals DI GERVENO passed the match folder

to the agent while both were waiting on a crowded street corner for

the red light to change, ät which

time AMCLOCK/1 told DI GERVENO

chat he hao no way to contact hin and would see him after lunch.

Operational Chrontoas

On 26 September AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1500 to 1830

at Iden B,

AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in

high spirits.

He was very glad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able

to discuss things openly.

He criticized bitterly the living conditions

in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that

he had to live under a regime he obviously hates.

In fact, he seemed

quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the

HTBASTE session.

He is scheduled to remain in New York until December

1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to l00k

after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks

prior to his departure.

This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to

think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise

to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts

about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy.

4.

AMCLOCK/1 explained that he could not make contact as instructed

because he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation

addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN.

He

destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN

in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals

at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had

nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1.

This may have been a convenient excuse for

hia failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press

che issue.

Instead he was given

the operational numbers of the Beekman

site and of the Base in

]Iden It and told he could always call

there if he could not locate DI

GERVENO at (den B.)

He was"

also given

the IMWAVE number for emergency contact.

AMCIOCK/1 said he tried to

make contact by calling (Iden J'to inquire about MIDDAUGH in true name,

bur after much probing he was told that MIDDAUGH was in Washington and

wag given a phone number for him to call direct.

AMCLOCK/1 was planning

to call Washington at a later day it he had not been contacted.

5. AMCLOCK/1 reported that he has had no security problems and

has not been molested inside of PBRUMEN. He was treated "royally" by

the AMTHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see

him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri

vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live.

During thie time he enjoyed special privileges

and received frequent

invitationa to official functions wich foreign diplomats.

However.

by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually

suspended for no apparent reason.

(For example, he was no longer

allowed to taxe his private car to a government garage for repairs

and he had

to arrange for themaintenance of his house, which was given

to him and kept up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes

that this was due to his being under "observation" while going through

a reorientation period after his long stay abroad. There is nothing

to indicate that AMCLOCK/1 is not trusted or accepted by other govern-

ment officials. The fact that he was

sent out again ig.lustrong

indication that he enjoys

favorable position in the AMTHUG regime.

He hopes that in 1968 he will be assigned to another permanent post

abroad.

6.

In reference this w. fe AMCLOCK/l stated that he is now

convinced that she is totally against the AMTHUG regime. After

their marriage in late 1966 he was rot sure of her true political

ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her

disagieement on a number of occasions.

as

defection,

but has not told her about his work for worACT.

AMCLOCK/// reported that with

them came Iden 1) a known intelligence typer and four other individuals

not known to him bur believed to be intelligence/types. Later AMCLOCK/.

identified these individuals asIdens i,M, NandO. In answer to

specific questions AMCLOCK/1 said that the crate they brought contained

only a vase fazlIden P. AMCLOCK/l is not aware if any weapons or special

instructions have been sent to (IdenT in connection with racial dis- 9

turbances in WOLADY.

The routine instructions given to @den Pwere to

oppose INHARP actions in HIBASTE whenever possible and to try to bringi

all debatable matters to HYBASTE, where they have better support

8. AMCLOCK/I was not seen going in of out of the room and the

meeting was conducted without interruption under most secure condi-

tions, DI GERVENO established immediate rapport with AMCLOCK/1 and

theix relations remained most cordial throughout the meeting. Only

DI GERVENO and AMCLOCK/1 were present.

Etnances

DI GERVENO was careful

not to mention

salary payments to

AMCLOCK/l who is not aware of his salary increase to $1,000 a month

effective & January 1966.

However.

he requested $500 to buy books

and baby items for his daughter.

DI GERVENO told him that he would

bring hin the money in their next meeting. All payments to AMCLOCK/1

will be i/n'd to IMWAVE together with the agent's signed receipts.

Operational Chronology

On 27 September 1967 AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1130 to

1530

for lunch at the Becknan site.

The agent was not seen

entering

or leaving the site and he stayed out of sight when food was brought

up from the restaurant downstairs,

The meeting was conducted under

secure conditions and without interruptions. Only AMCLOCK/1 and

DI GERVENO were present at the meeting.

.2.

AMClOCK/d Feported that he had been assigned to work in

Iden Ä with(Iden Bi same as last year. A few days before his departure

from PBRUMEN, (Iden @told AMCLOCK/1 to watch out for (Iden

B who is a

member of the intelligence service and will be reporting on AMCLOCK/l.

The implication was that AMCLOCK/I was still under observation by the

AMTHUG regime and (Iden C'actually told him

to bend backwards in every

way possible to prove himself while in New York. AMCLOCK/1 explained

that this meant to live a model life while abroad and to perform extra

work whenever required, without complaining. AMCLOCK/1 believes that

(Iden B is being trained to take over AMCLOCK/l's position as an expert

in economics for the AMPHUG regime.

If this is the case, this may be

he last time AMCLOCK/L is sent toliden A Still, under much probing,

AMCLOCK/i could not come out with any clear indication that he was

suspected or was

falling out of grace with the AMTHUG regime. Although

the agent has a tendency to emphasize his "delicate" position, the

case officer believes that he is not mistrusted and still enjoys a

favorable position in the government

bourgeois to be completely integrated with their communist philosophy.

3 .

Regarding the recent changes made in PBRUMEN diplomatic

pcisonnel

abroad, AMCLOCK/1 was not aware of any security shake up

taking place in the Foreign Ministry.

He regarded these changes

as a routine master in accordance with their policy to bring back

reorientation tour all those diplomats stationed

abroad for three

consecutive years or more. AMCLOCK/1 actually

CESSNSITIAD

appeared not to be aware of any major purge and not to be concerned

about it. However, if this is true the chances for AMCLOCk I to be

reassigned abroad in the near

future appear doubtful. at this time.

When DI GERVENO asked AMCLOCK/1 about his work and how the

recent changes may affect him, the agent then reported the following

information about his position in the Foreign Ministry. After his

return in late December 1966 he was given four months vacation, during

which time he went by the ministry trom time to time but had no job

assigned to him. He used most of this time for a honeymoon and to

relocate in his new home furnished by the PBRUMEN government.

sabing of 1967 fIden Ciconsidered him actively as a substitute for

éden D'whom Iden does not like. However, the job did not materialize

because (Iden C'S plans te send Eden D' as Ambassador to Canada were not

accepted by Iden E whom Iden E'was going to send as Ambassador to

switzerland.

At that time AMCLOCK/1 was also

considered for a position

in Iden Fi which was the position the PBRUMEN President

take, but AMCLOCK/1 avoided the position although it implied frequent

Eravis abroad.

The reason AMCLOCK/1 gave for not taking the position

at (iden E) was

that he did not want to break away from his diplomatier

career and felt he would be better protected among his frends in the

Foreign Ministry.

Consequently, after his vacation AMCLOCK/I want

back to work in the Foreign Ministry but without any specific duties.

He is actually doing odd jobs for Iden C, like economic studies.

mid 1967 AMCLOCK/1 and(Iden G)were proposed by (Iden Cand accepted by

Eden Das members of/a four-man committee (the other two membore

not been selected yet) which is to be created in the Foreign Miniairy

to make specific area studies and recommendations to Oden it sinca

it is concluded that the creation of said "Advisory Committee" in not

of this "Advisory Committee" has beer discussed at the haghest levela

only and it may have some influence in the policy maxing decision

note that in the past year that AMCLOCK/1 has been residing inside o!

PBRUMEN he has made no clear effort to obtain and develop new sources

of information and to bring out with him intelligence of particular

interest to us. For example, he has no information on the apocalis

requirements we gave him in 1966 prior to his retuin to PaRuMel and

when asked to identify his main sources of information he said trey
