And

second; I want to say that the zeport, I guess everybody

DOW

has a copy of the seport, has been revised subscandald

in terns of format and approach, and i think it zexoes in

completely on what che original request of Senators Church and

Tower were, which was, to look inco the pertormanoe relacionship

ol the intelligence agencies to the kennedy assassination and

the Warren Commission.

i chink the earlier seport Crankly

strayed a little bit from that goal, but we I think nave pinned

it down very specifically and i think we bave substanciated

the stacement of the Conclusions in the summary that we made.

I would like to reconnend I realize you cannot read che

whole report, buc i think you can certainly get ine complete

gist of what we are saying in the summary and in the conclusions

by reading those two things you pretty well come

down on what

we are saying and doing. and in view of.

the time factor, a

suggestion i would like to make is that if people take time co

sead the sumardos and conclusions, which we can do in a matter

06 Live minutes at some point, and basically toel saciatied

as to the thrust of it, -that we thet vote on

the release of che

report under this condicion, coat we vote to publicly release

the report and chen, since there are poviousy: want to get

informacion we have here in terms of just following it up.

I do think it is

& very good job.. I chink it is a very

credible. work; and I think thac by caking chis phase and

publicly releasing is now, after we dave cleared the CiA and

the FBI problems, it vill give Danny Inouye's Committee a

Exee hand.

In ocher words, all we made is a cecommendation.

we don't publish a report now, you immediately get a real

problem in your Comittee, as I see, as to what you do with what

We

have done.

If we pubiish now. I think you are a lot freer

secide, having us made a judgment on

the ChA and FBi

responsibilicy, whether you want to pursue or not pursue.

Wa

obviously recommend that you pursue, but I think if we don't

publish that,. I think chat would be a bad mistake, because

we would be accused of a coverup. We would also immediately put

hot potato in your new Comittee which you would be hung with,

and I think it gives you a lot nore freedom so treat at arm's

length our recommendations if we publish now in berms of the

Rol and the cia relationshios

i think chat there

is some embarzassment here

to boch the

CIA

and the abi.

I don't think we should kid oursalves aboui

that.

We don't find out who done it; and we don': contradict

the basic finding of the warren Commission, buc ve certainly

criticize the process and subscancially document why thai

criticism is valid, and i chink just the sane as our original

assassination report. our abudy or the and of other things,

I think this would tall inco that kind of categorical treatment.

That, I guess, is iny situation in a nutshell:

Senator lower.

Do you want to have the staff summarize

this, Dick?

Senatos Schweiker.

that probably would be waii.

Senator Power,

Why don't you call on whoever you choose to

Kick 1: 0662

Senator Schweikes. All right. We did cry to be very

even handed, as i say.

Neither the CIA or the FBi is going to

like what we say.

on the other hand, i don"t think we singled

out One agency in either respect, so Paul, how do you want to

divide up the briet report?

Mr. Wailach.

i think i cen begin just by putcing the

ceport in perspective, but I thin that if we take

÷ step back

and I am going to ask jim just to ceally detail juot quickly

again, succinocly the period from 1960 through November 22nd,

1963, the day of the assausination, just very generally what

the agencies were doing at that time period, and i will come

back and tie in what the Est was doing with Oswald during chat

cine period, which

ia one sectron of our report.

And then the next

section of our report really goes

HOW

agencies

reacted in one of the nost

critical time

periode, and I thinks that you will vee that there was an incaiii

The intelligence failure before I don't want to say was of

a nasure that would have prevented the assassination, and chere

18 no suco statement

in the repoxt to chas effeco, in fact, the

suggestion is not really even enece.

What you do see are many

probiens inherent in coe structure as ic now exists between

tha

N91 and

che CIa: probleme that cane up during the investigation

wnere

there vere quescions as to who had jurisdiction to investi

gate what, and many areas feil beoween the cracks. You have

che problem of covert accione thar our Commiccee has looked

dece may have been a covert action that was 'so covert.

thac no one could tell the investigators about it, and it

backfired, in à sense,

on some of the highest officials in the

country+

And many other problems & think that our Coumittee

has dealt with cone out so clearly on the scudy that we have

made on the assassination report:

I just woule ask Jim so very orleily jusc make

a couple of

scatements about that period so you

can get a feel as to what

really

I know che committee has a good feel as to whas ve

were doing vis-a-vis Cuba, but I don't think it has the sane

feel as to what was happening with the

anti-Castro exile groups

in shis councey in the context of Lee Marvey Dewald.

Like the warren Comussion fully understood the vele program

the Uniced states Goveanmenc had been running against Cuba tor

three years.

They knew about the Bay of Pigs, they fully mderatood that

Te 1s unclear

if they knew about now that evolved inco a

MONGOOSE operation, which was the use of Cuban exiles to accomplisi

the same end, and now apparently, after the missile crisis of

October 1962, Government policy again changed to a clamp down

on Cuban exiles, the very group that the Government had been

supporting for two years.

Ultinately as events moved inco the summer of 1963, the

United States Govemment was raiding, seizing arms of the Cuban

exile

groups on the one hand, and on the other hand, using the

CIA to accomplish the same ends by having CIA agents make those

caids againse Cuba.

And it ultimately evolved inco the ANuASH

operacion, which is au

operation apparently designed to bring

about a coup in Cuon wich AMLASt himselt proposing that they do

that by assassination of Castro.

And 'especially after dune or 1963, things becare very

The CIA has escalated by dis own coup planning.

The report then focuses principally on how AMASh figured

into this scheme,

Castro in eacty September warned againat

U.S. leadera who were meeting with sectorist in Cuba, and that

he would threaten zetaliacion againsc o. S. leadera:

and the

coincidence of that warning coning two days after the original

meetings wich AMASa.

points of all tbai has just come to light.

S0 go

ahead, Jim,

I just wanted to call cheir attencion to it.

Me, Johnston.

One of the interagency committees dealing

wach Cuba on September 12th, which is five days after Castro's

warning, had a meeting to evaluate cheir contingency Plans

Cuban retaliacion.

We have nad access to the memorandun ot

General Haig who was ackending that meating, and in that menoran

dim, according: to. General Haig, whac went on at the meeting

was they

Was there any evidence that General

Haig

had

ever been further questioned about that?

Mr. johnston, No, sic.

Subsequent to that meeting, on the 12th of

September,

they continued their contingency pian, and they had eliminated

the possibility that Castro would retaliace by an assassination

assassiation of a 0.5, Leader within this country.

And again, we know little about the group's planning. We

do know that events in the AMLASH

operation on september 12th

would indicate that they were not duily at that point decided

on the face thas they would use AMLASA to assassinace Castro,

or that they would ever give him that assurance.

in any event, they did later give that

assurance to AMASS

after these series of meetings of the inceragency committee

were

over,

and on October 29th, 1963, Desmond Fitzgerald, who

was head of the Cuban Affairs Staff, actually net. with AMLASH

in Paris, and

the significance of that id, at least

co out

Mc. Johnston, We belleve so.

le was vacned not to do it.

Senator Schweiker.. Several people warned him not to do

chat; John.

We have records of that. So he

went against sort

of in-house policy.

Mr. Wallach.

He also stated, I believe, that te was &

personal representative speaking for the

Attorney General.

Me. Epstein.

One of the reasons they had been expressing

advice that they noc have that kind of a meeting, because

they

were concerned about whether the project was secucity, the

security, of course, involving the question of whether or noc

AMLASH night be & double agent and might not be trustworthy and

whether the information might get back co Castro, which later

bears a relationship to whether or not that threat that Castro

made was based on real knowledge or not.

Me. Johnston. At this point in the chronology, before the

Ficagerald meeting on Occober 29th; the FBI learned through

a source it bad

point because it

Nr: Johnstoa: AMASa had the reputation of being a pcatty

eigney character,

and had during the revolution against Baciaca

once

shot

somebody or killed a man in a bar, and that was

indeed his attractiveness, was chat de was probably fairly weil

known as someone who was capable of assassination. So the

knowiedge oucside of the CLA

of the face that AlLASH was neting

with tue Cia could lead many people to believe chat the Cin

was using him in an assassination plot, even though there is

nO

indication in the FBI report that the source knew of the

nature of the CiA-AMLASH meetings:

The point is chat in eaci?

October, the CiA operation using AMLASt was compromised, and

in appears that the Cuban exiles, anti-Castro cuban exiles

could have had knowledge the CIA was engaged in this piot.

This goes ultimacely to mocivation of other groups to

06G

an assassination attempt agatose Kennedy for cheir ow

P100s25.

Ia any evenc, planning with AlLASt continued until

altinacely, two days befoce the President's assassinacion, he

was toid that chere vould

be a meeting on Movember 2206, and

chat it was

not the meeting - he aidn"t know whether the

meeting

would be

satisfactory to AMLASA; but it was the neering

that.

AMLASt had requested, and so aocually that neeting was

set

Mr. Johnston. I just wanted to nake one point followiny

up on this.

the detailed report buiids the duss' in the two weeks

after the Presidens's assassination, the incocmacion that was

coning

into Cid, and much of that infomation is pointing to

Cuba.

indeed, the

hottest leads that were coming into CiA

Pointed to Cuba,

and yet we find that by the and of December

the Cuban specialiste, at diA. were not put directly in touch

with the warren Commiscion; and they were not pue in touch cr

they were not given the responsibilicy for continuing the

investigation, and indeed, they have testified, che counterintelli

sence expert on Cuban afrairs, testified that he never really

sat down with any of che invescigacors to analyze a11 oi che

facts in the Oswald case, to see whether there was any possibility

of & conneccion with cuba.

And so what it appears, what we have done in this report

1s to build the case, then, of all of the possibilities of

conspiracy on a giobal scale, the most likely looked to be a

conspiracy somehow involving eicher pro di anti-Castro forces,

and we do

ne

never comes out and says it, but he always troils around

in those waters about Soviet connections in the assassination.

to the degree that Angleton was involved in the

investigation of the Keunedy assassination, I think he greatly

coloced the direction that that investigation took coward che

Soviec side instead of the pro and anti-Castro or the cuban

side.

Senator Schweiker: There are two other footnotes.

is that when the first. CIA chief investigator terminated his

thrust it the ceport had then been writter, he then went and

Senator Hart of Colorado. Pussuant to the policy reached

between President Kennery and Khruschey, Khruscher puils the

found 'documents that tell us about this interdepartmental

opened it when he defected to the soviet union, and they later.-

viewed him cwice when he came back to chis country. On boch

of those occasions he lied capeatedly to the agent who was

interviewing bal.

And the agent luew he lied because he hed

the agent asked hit

to take & polygrach teet

as to nis cesponses, as to ties wich

he

was requested that he take a

Oswald refused.

Despite that fact, and despite the fact that the

supervisor said

tha: the case on lee oswald could be followed

in conjunction with the case ou Marina, the Oswald case was

closed

immediately after boch of those interviews.

Now, while the Commictee nas documented all of the

were

proper or improper.

I make no juägment on that.

I just want to say thai they were used on security cases.

None of those were

he was interviewad by a Department 13 officer, they have a

record that

he had an interview with & Deparcment 13,

that.

M1, Wallach,

that I really wanted to cone down on was

the fact that with all of these facts in hand, on the day of

the assassination, one of Mr. Hoover's first responses was to

direct his chief inspector, Inspector Gale, who wac Assiscan:

Director of the FBI, to conduct ar investigation of the Bureal'e

handling

of the Oswald case before the

assassination.

Six days

later Gale came down wich I think it is an 18

page report citing numezous what be called, and I quote,

serious investigative deficiencies in the FBi's handling of.

the pre-Oswald assassination case. And I want to be clear.

there is no statement in there which says the fBi could have

prevented Oswald, or in any way

chat these deficiencies would

have

prevented Oswald from assassinating the President.

Buc the fact chat

the PBt was criticizing its own internal

handling of

Senator Hart of Colorado.

That

is a very critical point,

also, becadse we have got to be careful in anyching we write.

IC 1s not just separating the agencies from the Commission..

Ic is separating the leadership of the agencies from their

rank and file.

As Jim and Paui boch have testified, we

go through here

and Lault the CIA and

there was obviously a conscious eifort, as

the scaff has

cestified, by che leadership of both agencies,

to prevent those

assigned, to provide investigative capability to the commission,

So you cannot even fault the whole agency because I think:

Jim and i were sitting at the EBI, they brought

in the file on AMLASH. They

left out two critical documents.

By reviewing the serials we saw that two were missing. They

just happened to be the two

documents which established that

they had knowledge of AMLASH. I think the critical fact is

not only did they have knowledge of smash, but they, got that

knowledge from i Cuban source in the Cuban community down in

Florida, and as one FBi agent said, when one Cuban knows some

things, ic is not a secret.

They knew that that most secret

operacion was compromised, and they never told the CiA.

Senator Schweiker.

In fact, we have

a memo of the FBI

saying

don't tell the Cia that their operation was compromised.

I mean,

this is so typical of wai you find through that

invescigacion, they wouldn't even tell the cia their

agent was flawed, and they kept that a secret from che CIA.

Me. Johnston, What de seems to be js this. Me. Dulles

was replaced in November of 1961 by Mir. MoCone. But Mr. Dulles

indeed, when that repiacement occurred, President Kennedy

desired a shake-up of the CIA, and othes organizational changes

were made so that Mr. Dulles' knowledge would have been complete

knowledge as of November 1961. He probably knew about the

Mafia plots.

Whether he knew about the evolurion through

MONGOOSE and on so the AMLASHl plots is leas certain, We have

no evidence that

he knew about the AMTASH plot, and on this

point, Mr. Angleton, who was then head of the CIA counterintelli

gence, told us that he met with Dulles frecuently, in fact,

mec

with Dulles frequently during the cougse of the warren

Commission and they would bounce ideas book and forth.

It is important to. note that Mr. Angleton said that he

did not know of the AMLASH

operacion, and that indeed he was

compartmented.out of most. Cuban operations, although he nad

a general kaowledge of it. He did not have the detailed

knowledge of Cuban operations chat cher people did.

we, at least the

evidence looks like that Dulles would

höve known about the mafia plots, but we have no evidence that

he ever could

have learned about the later operations.

Not why.

Mr:. Miller.

Why insofar as they were able to determine:

out he said it was

their view, and they feel there is nothing

that they have seen during their inquiry that would make them

believe otherwise, that it was Oswald, and that it was the

circumstances of the assassination, and Oswald himself they

focused on and his motivations and so on.

We have actempted to detail every

There

no evidence that the AMLASH operation was detailed to

President Johnson. There is evidence that the Pcesideni was

cold tuily abouc the general thruse of the covert operacions

against Cuba, and apparently told that chis included

sone coup

plans.

It would be very important to find out precisely what ha

that there were coup planning in the works, that's one thing,

If he were told that the coup plan had reached the stage that

Desmond. Fitzgerald had met with this agent and assured hin

thinks the other option has to be kept open.

This is something, Dan, you may or

Since it is a suggestion of Senator dart,

che Agencies all the materials that have been on a loan basis:

and i think our account is cier in this respect. What is

left in the flies after removing, returning and destroying

are 15 file cases of four drawers each of material that we

think might be of use to a successor commitee.

The problem this

poses for the successor committee

that

because of the mass

of material, there

has

S01s

means

of communicating

what is inside the files to the new

connittee.

Ic would be my cecommendation that For a transi.

tional period, that the research group, that ie be recommended

that the zesearch group be taken on by the oversight committee

for a period of transition so that they can make a decision

whether they want to recain all or any of the material thas

the Select Committee has acquired in its 18 months of existence.

Senator Huddleston, And there is a matter of security to

continue, too.

Mic. Maller.

the security sacuation is, I chink the most

secure place for it as the moment is to renain in the audicorin

with, ideally with Mr. Marshall or some equivalent.

Senator Rover, What you suggesc is that this committee

else:

And at the appzopriate

time, iive don't want it, ve will juat throw it away:

At chis moment we are juse putting a big hand on it.

Senator Tower. i don't think this requires any formal

action by this Committee. I chink we all agree that the

cransition will be made, that all the remaining materials

in our files will be turned over to them, subject to their

making a determinacion of what they

want.

And

then i would suppose it could be worked out wich the

Buc in the transition, we intend, at least I am going to

recommend, that we retain some of the personnel you have

here for purposes of transition, bur this is a bad time, it

you know what i mean, We are right on the eve of a recess, and

the troops are going to scatter, and

so i hope that those we

will be selecting, they will be notified,

but they may find

themselves with a one-week hiatus or something like that.

They may have to survive on

beans for a week or something.

Formal

sction by the Committee?

Senator Inouye.

May i request that your Committee submit

at the earliest the list of those who you

feel

should

be in this transicion team?

Senator lower. The staff is so directed.

Is there any further question?

Senator Huddleston. By about 2:30 chis afternoon.

Senator lower. Is there any further question or any

urcher pending

jousiness?

Senator Mathias, Well, John, there is one other question

about which I feel sone responsibility.

I made a motion that the gross expenditure for intelligence

purposes

should not be divuiged in, the Conmitice report, and

that that question should be referred for decision to the full

Genate.

No action has been taken by the full Senate on that

reminded me,

because is was decided by a margin of one vote.

and i supported his motion. I did it then in the belier that

it would be one of she easiest clubs to be used by chose who

did not want the creacion of a permanent commitcae, to clobber

is with.

i did it also in the beliet that when is was presented

to the Senate, that is probably would then be disclosed.

we get the issue before the Senate,

I chink it is almost inevitable that it
