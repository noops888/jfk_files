2. Leaks of Classifiod Defenso Information

The esplonage statute applies to such leaks..

Upon receipt of zu allegation of a.leak of classi

fied defense data, not involving Restricted, Data

under the Atomic Energy Act; we advise the refer-

ing agency that the leak in question is administra

tive in nacure and is one to be handled by the

date involved.

In each instance we send e copy of

our referral and of our reply to the Internal

Miles 561149005499305

In the light of the specific statutory responsibility

assigned to the FBI to investigate leaks of Restricted Data

• subjeci to the Atomic Energy Act (42 USC, 2271(b)) and the

responsibility pursuant to a directive issued by President

Roosevelt on Septenber 6, 1939, reissued by President Roosevelt

January 8, 1443 and restrimes by. President truman on July t,

1950, "to take charge of investigative work in matters selating

to espionage, sauviago diù violations of cho nauceality zogula-

cions"

• It is the opinion of the Department that while cases

involving leaks of classified defense information should be.

considered primarily matiers to be handled by the agency which

is cesponsible for safeguarding the information, it remins,

however, the sesponsibility of the Department to determine

shether a specific set of facts constitute a violation of ou

criminal statutes.

It Is recommended that the responsible department 0r.

agency be requested to fumish the IBI at the time it reports

the leak to the bureau the same background data as now supplied

by the Atonic ergy Comission in 1Es cases. The FBI could ac

that time refer the natter to the Department for a determination

as to whether the investigation should be taken over by the Burea

For the purpose of attenpting to develop evidence to establish

Violacion of the espionage statutes.

3. Data covered by Paragraph 5, National.

SUBJECT:

Senate Select Committee Request for Information

on Warrantless "Electronic Surveillances

i 10:11.60

.SP-Z.ALM)ITG

In accord with our telephone conversation of August 12th,

I am forwarding to you a letter from the Senate Select

Committee requesting answers to questions relating to

electronic surveillance conducted by the Federal govern-

ment in the interests of national security. The Committee

has been told that we would try to respond

to their

request by August 20th. That date is fast approaching

may not be a reasonable period of time in which to

compile the information requested and respond to their

questions. That date is a useful target, however, since

any issues to be presented to the Attorney General

with

respect to complying to this request must be considered

prior to August 19th, the date the Attorney General is

scheduled to leave Washington.

Would your office please prepare responses to the following

questions that involve areas with which, I believe, you

are familiar: questions 2-10, 11(b)-(d), 12, 14, 15, 17,

21 and

TAP SECRET

Mr. Chairman, I wish to furnish the Subcommittee

additional details regarding our mail covers and surveys;

however, some of this information enters sensitive areas

involving national security, and I respectfully request it

be presented in executive session.

As I have indicated previously, the FBI's use

of mail covers and surveys as investigative techniques has been

based on fulfilling its lawfully mandated responsibilities.

The list of intelligence accomplishments resulting

from mail covers on foreign establishments alone is long,

but perhaps these examples will suffice:

In February, 1975, a member. of the military holding

a "secret" clearance obtained while in training was determined

to be in contact with a foreign establishment.

Also last February, an individual with a "secret"

• clearance employed on a missile project was in such contact.

In November,. 1974, a scientist involved in atomic

research was determined to be in such contact.

We have discovered through mail coverage on the

United Nations Mission of a communist country that a wide

range of individuals and corporations have been in contact

with an official establishment of a foreign country with

which the United States has no diplomatic relations.

TEP SECRET

With reference to our former use of mail survey

programs in which we surveyed

mail

for indicators as to whether

further processing is warranted, permit me to further explain

the seven programs which I previously outlined in public

testimony:

Of these surveys, one was established in New York

as a result of the experience gained in the investigation

of a Soviet illegal. This illegal cooperated with the FBI;

and we learned that in directing mail to his Moscow center,

he addressed it in a specific fashion and also directed it

to mail drops in Europe.

From this experience, we were able to develop a .

set of indicators which allowed us to select mail which we

felt was illegal agent mail. This, coupled with our knowledge

of known Soviet mail drops on this side of the Iron Curtain,

permitted effective screening of the mail and selection of

letters on a knowledgeable basis.

This method was proved successful when we uncovered

three such illegals and successfully neutralized their

activities. This survey was conducted between 1959 and 1966.

A second survey was based on the use of these same

indicators in examining incoming mail directed to certain areas

of New York City and other cities in an effort to detect mail

being directed to illegal agents in the United States. This

survey was conducted between 1961 and 1962.

A third survey was based on our knowledge that

illegal agents in the United States directed communications

to Soviet bloc intelligence officers employed at the United

Nations in New York City. Again, this survey was based on

solid information that this means of communication was

utilized by the hostile intelligence service. This survey

was conducted between 1963 and 1966.

A fourth survey was conducted in the Miami, Florida,

area. It also utilized the known indicators and the known

mail drop addresses on mail being sent from the United States

to Cuba. As an example, during the period of time this program

existed in Miami, from January 2, 1963, until July 21, 1966,

60 letters were determined to contain secret ink messages

either on the letter or on the envelope.

Two other surveys were directed against mail being

sent to the United States from the People's Republic of China

and Hong Kong, as well as mail directed from the United States

to China. The coverage of mail from the People's Republic

of China and Hong Kong was initiated August 1, 1956, and was

discontinued on January 24, 1966. The coverage of mail directed

to China operated between 1964 and 1966.

The purpose of these two surveys was to acquire

information concerning Americans living in China of interest

to the intelligence agencies of the United States; to detect

efforts by the People's Republic of China to persuade scientists

of Chinese descent in the United States to return to the

People's Republic of China; to detect efforts to arrange

travel by these scientists and to learn any information they

would provide the People's Republic of China; to ascertain

identities of subscribers to and recipients of Chinese

propaganda publications; and to develop information concerning

persons of security interest in the United States who were

corresponding with persons in the People's Republic of China.

The seventh survey, conducted from 1940 to 1966,

was of mail addressed to Soviet-bloc and other embassies and

diplomatic missions of national security interest.

This program was initiated shortly before the

United States entered World War II and its vital necessity

during those perilous times seems obvious.

Following World War II, the seventh program was

concentrated against the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc countries,

and much greater selectivity was used in screening letters

to be opened.

We were able, for example, in 1964 to detect

the fact a civilian employee of the United States Navy

offered to sell classified information to the Soviet Embassy

for $50,000.

With regard to the FBI's participation in the CIA

mail interception project, when we were offered data from

TAP SECRET

- 4 -

NH 55138 DocId: 32989631 Page 90

## Page 91

IP SECRET

that operation, we initially set forth four specific areas

of data which could be of value to our national security

responsibility:

1. Correspondence of a suspicious nature which

might contain double talk;

2. Correspondence indicating Soviets might be

using a hostage situation to develop sources in the United States.

3. Correspondence indicating a weakness or

dissatisfaction on the part of any Soviet in the United States.

4. Information indicating Soviet control or direction

of the Communist Party, U.S.A.

In August, 1961, we advised the CIA that we were

interested in letters in which the United States addressee

or addressor was a Government employee, working in a

sensitive industry, or an American wishing to defect to

- Russia.

In February, 1962, we established ádditional

guidelines regarding the type of letters for which we had

a requirement to help further our efforts to uncover illegals.

Knowledgeable FBI officials reviewed this data

periodically, and surveys were conducted, to assure that we

were receiving only data pertinent to our legitimate

responsibilities.

Legal basis for mail covers

The FBI utilizes mail covers as an investigative

technique in accordance with requirements set down by

law and the Postal Service. Procedures for obtaining

mail covers are precisely set out in the Postal Manual,

Section 861.

The legality of mail covers has been substantiated

by a number of court decisions, beginning with Mr. Justice

Field's statement in Ex parte Jackson (1877); recognition

of this view through Oliver v. United States (1957); United

States V. Costello (1958); United States V. Schwartz (1960) ;

Cohen v. United States (1967); Lustiger V. United States (1968) ;

United States V. Isaacs (1972); cert. denied 417 U.S. 976 (1974) .

History of Utilization by FBI of mail covers

The FBI has utilized mail covers allowed by the

U. S. Post Office Department and subsequently the Postal

Service as early as 1928. FBI procedures have been in

accordance with Post Office policies and procedures in

effect at a particular time.

From 1928 to 1945, Special Agents in Charge of

respective field offices were authorized to request a mail

cover from the appropriate Post Office official in their

respective territories. In 1945, the FBI policy was changed

to allow the SAls this authority only in cases involving

deserters, fugitives and escaped Federal prisoners. All

top SECRET

MH 55138 DocId:32989634 Pate 99

## Page 100

other cases

required FBI Headquarters approval. In 1947,.

the FBI's policy was returned to the pre-1945 rule and

SACs were again permitted to request authority from the

Post Office without approval of FBI Headquarters. In 1954,

however, regulations were instituted whereby all mail covers

were to be limited to thirty days and justified to Headquarters

prior to being requested. This policy of final determination

by FBI Headquarters is in effect today.

Current statistics of mail covers utilization by FBI

As of June 17, 1975, current mail covers requested

or in place totaled 129. They were as follows: National

security - 69; Fugitive - 59; Criminal - 1.

The number of mail covers represents a minute

fraction of the total number of investigations pending on

a daily basis.

Authorization procedures consistent with Postal regulations

The FBI follows the procedures for obtaining mail

covers set out in the Postal Manual, Section 861. Inasmuch

as the FBI fits the "law enforcement agency" definition in

the Manual, we make our requests to the Chief Postal Inspector

or the Regional Postal Inspectors in Charge, depending on

the type of mail cover requested.

No level of authorization in the requesting agency

is specified in the Postal Manual. However, as indicated

SECRET

2-

HW 55138

DocId: 32989634 Page 100

---

## Page 101

SLURE I

above, present FBI regulations require that mail cover

requests must be first cleared through FBI Headquarters

for approval.

FBI Headquarters screens the request to insure

that the mail cover can be potentially productive and that

the nature of the case is of sufficient import to justify

the technique. These decisions are made upon justification

from the field office, review by Headquarters' supervisory

personnel, with final decision resting at the Deputy Associate

Director level or above.

Benefits achieved by mail covers

Mail covers have proved to be valuable as an

investigative technique in certain investigations. For example,

mail covers have led to the identification of individuals

holding security clearances who contact hostile intelligence

services and who have provided intelligence information of

interest to the hostile foreign intelligence services.

Over the years mail covers have provided leads

which have resulted in the location of fugitives.

In

criminal cases, mail covers have provided information that

has led to the discovery of evidence of criminal violations.

Purpose of mail covers

Lawful mail covers as an investigative technique are

based on the premise that discovery of an individual's

contacts provides knowledge of the individual's actions,

ECRET

NW 55138 DocId:32989634 Page 101

---

## Page 102

TOP SECRET

as well as indicates other avenues by which knowledge of

the individual can be obtained.

Objectives, of course, vary depending on the

type of investigation involved. For example, in fugitive

cases, mail covers may be used in instances when the

fugitive's close associates or relatives are obviously

hostile or suspected of being

SO.

When official contact

by law enforcement with these persons is rebuffed or

impractical, mail covers are often useful.

In selected situations where a crime has been

committed or an attempt made to do so, mail covers can

be used to identify participants or co-conspirators and

provide leads in investigations.

In national

security matters, the insight provided

by mail covers is invaluable. The FBI's successful fulfillment

of its national security role rests largely in determining

the activities of hostile intelligence services. The mails

are obviously a means of communication which allows a

foreign intelligence service accessibility to persons or

places from which they would otherwise be prohibited by

law or where their physical presence would be suspect and

thereby negate a covert effort on their part. Knowledge of

their mail contacts can open avenues of lawful investigation

which can be most productive.

DAP JEGRET

The FBI has conducted seven mail survey programs

solely in the discharge of its national security responsibilities.

None has been conducted since 1966.

These surveys were instituted because of their

potential value in discharging the FBI's responsibilities

in the national security field.

These surveys were conducted to detect and identify

foreign agents who threaten this Nation's security and to

detect other persons who indicated willingness, and were

in a position, to sell out this country to hostile foreign

powers. Each survey program was carefully circumscribed

as to its scope and was conducted for specific objectives

with strict administrative controls.

These surveys involved the processing, or opening,

of mail; but they did not involve wholesale, indiscriminate

opening of mail. In these surveys we were looking for

indicators as to whether review of the correspondence might

lead to the detection of an illegal foreign agent or a

person cooperating with a hostile foreign power. Although

considerable volumes of envelopes were surveyed, the vast

majority of this mail was not further processed because it

did not contain indicators which would make it relevant to

the survey•

AUL INCORI! THOS CONTAINED

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August-5,1975, Supervisor Richard H. Bloeser

was interviewed by SSC

Staff Member Lester Seidel at the

Los Angeles FBI Office regarding the COINTELPRO/Black Panther

Party (BPP).

Mr. Seidel advised Supervisor Bloeser that the

interview was voluntary, but did not advise Supervisor

Bloeser of his rights in this matter.

Mr.

Seidel inquired of

Supervisor Bloeser as to

how many offices he had served in, his length of service in

the Bureau, and how long had been spent on intelligence

investigations.

Supervisor Bloeser replied that he had

served in Philadelphia, El Paso and Los Angeles, had been.

in the Bureau approximately 24% years, and had been assigned

to intelligence work for 22 years.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Supervisor Bloeser

believed that the Bureau had placed undue pressure on the

field to come up with counter intelligence proposals concerning

the BPP and was it difficult to come up. with a proposal.

Supervisor Bloeser responded that there was no undue pressure

I placed of the field by the Bureau, that the COINTELPRO/BPP

was merely another case assigned

. to an agent and that agent,

as in any other case, had the responsibility of handling the

matter whether it concened the solving of a case of the

submission of proposals. Mr. Seidel was also informed that

and it ition to

it was not unduly difficult to come up with a proposal and that

a number of proposals were rejected at the field level and

never submitted to the Bureau.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically as to counter

intelligence proposals involving cartoons ridiculing the BPP.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER •

Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely remembered such

proposals but without reviewing the file had no definite

recollection. Mr. Seidel did not request that the file be

reviewed.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically about a business

card which allegedly

had been

prepared by the Bureau bearing

the phrase "Kazenga is impotent."

Mr. Seidel requested

Supervisor Bloeser's views on the distribution of this card

by the FBI. Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely

remembered the card, that he thought it was humorous, and

that the word impotent had various meanings.

Mr. Seidel then inquired about the blood feud

which existed in the past between the US Organization and

the BPP and the efforts of the Bureau to keep this feud

alive and thus promote violence. He specifically inquired

any counter intelligence proposals which, if placed in

Supervisor Bloeser responded first that personally

he had no apologies for the counter intelligence program as

a whole, that proposals submitted six or seven years ago

were believed necessary at that time due to the circumstances,

specifically that at that time the BPP and the US Organization

were invölved in violent activity against the community as a

Mr. Seidel was informed that the feud between the US

Organization and the BPP occurred long before the FBI

COINTELPRO became involved in the feud and that any proposals

approved by the Bureau had relatively little effect on the

violence committed by either group.

Mr. Seidel was also

reminded that. six or seven years ago the Congress of the

United States fully supported the war in Vietnam in which

thousands of people were killed but that under todays

circumstances no support has been given to South Vietnam.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC):

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Seidel then posed a hypothetical question

involving

the following factors:

would Supervisor Bloeser

now or in the past approve a counter intelligence proposal

whereby one extremist with a criminal record of violence

be anonymously informed that another extremist with a

record of criminal violence was an informant for the FBI,

knowing that the alleged informant might be injured or

killed.

Supervisor Bloeser replied that under the present

conaitions such a proposal would not be approved, but

that he could not give an answer as to what his

feelings

might have been six or seven years ago under any given

situation.

Mr. Seidel was again reminded that Congress

in the past has not hesitated to support wars which kill

thousands of people but that recently they have critiseed

the CIA for allegedly plotting to assassinate one individual

whose death might prevent a war. Mr. Seidel was also informed

that it was ironic that Congress was investigating

another

agency of the Federal Government which was attempting to

prevent revolutionary violence in this country.

MI.

Seidel then inquired into the counter

intelligence proposals approved by the Bureau in relation

to the actress Jean

Seberg and Raymond Hewitt, a leader

of the BPP.

This proposal concerned the fact that Seberg,

who was then married to a French producer, admitted being

pregnant by Hewitt who was also married at the time. The

Bureau arproved anonymously leaking this information to a

Hollywood columnist.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether

Supervisor Bloeser did or did not believe that this was an

-- invasion of privacy. Supervisor Bloeser responded that the

item was news worthy and that it.would have been any fair game

for any newsmen had they come across it in the course of their

business which they could have probably

certainly congress would not have exitised fly done, and that

a newspaper fox

printing such an item or claim it to be an ivasion of privacy.

• Mr. Seidel inquired as to the purpose of.

this particular

operation and he was informed that Miss

Seberg was giving

support to the BPP and that it was hoped that such publicity

would prevent any future support by her of the BPP.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H.. BLOESER

BY •SSC STAFE MEMBER

He was further advised that it was the responsibility of the

FBI to determine who was funding revolutionary groups in this

country.

Mr. Seidel then inquired as to whether or not it

was difficult to conduct intelligence investigations under

present statutes and under the Criminal Rules of Procedure.

He was informed that it was somewhat difficult to conduct an

effective intelligence operation under present circumstances

and that perhaps new legislative or executive orders would be

helpful to the FBI in order to allow the FBI to continue its

investigations in the Domestic Intelligence field. Mr. Seidel

inquired as to whether it would be helpful to have specific

legislation which might completely separate criminal and

intelligence operations so one would not taint the other.

He was informed that if such legislation could be enacted

that it would undoubtedly help the FBI.'

The interview lasted approximately two hours and

it was not necessary to consult with

another Bureau

representative during this time.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting of

the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on

Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community (hereinafter

referred to as the Group) held at CIA Headquarters on the

afternoon of 6/16/75.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. William Colby in his

role as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). In

attendance were Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President;

Mr. Roderick Hills, Counsel to the President; Mr. James A.

Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President; Mr. John Clarke,

Associate Deputy to the DCI; as well as senior officials from

Defense, Treasury, National Security Agency (NSA), and the

National Security Council (NSC). The Bureau was represented

by Inspector John B. Hotis and Section Chief William O. Cregar

FOREIGN AGREEMENTS

There was considerable discussion among the members

as to whether the intelligence community would furnish to the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) copies of agreements between

various agencies of the intelligence community and their

counterparts in foreign governments. This apparently presents

a very difficult problem for the community and no decision was

made as to how these will be handled.

The White House, as well

as the Secretary of State, are considering how the community

should proceed.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

OUTLINE FOR INQUIRY PROCEDURES

Attached is a copy of the procedures for interviewing

current and former employees of any agency or department of

the intelligence community which interviews are to be conducted

by the SSC. The agreement was negotiated between the

White House and the SSC with little consultation with the

individual members of the intelligence community. The most

significant aspect of the agreement is identified on page 1,

paragraph A. This paragraph identifies two categories of

pa agrance

interviews

SSC Staff Members expect to conduct. They are:

1. Those primarily seeking information concerning

the overall structure and function of any agency of its rela-

tionship with other agencies or the Executive branch; the

substantive work done in the past or being done by the agency,

including the legal bases relied upon and the requisite approval

levels for authorization; the capacities of each agency and the

responsibilities to provide information for other governmental

entities.

2. As designated by the Committee, those primarily

concerning specific allegations of agency or Executive branch

abuses or other controversial specific matters where there is

reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

As a general rule, an agency representative will be

present at interviews or preliminary testimony in the first

category. Similarly, as a general rule, agency representatives

will not be present at interviews or preliminary testimony in

the second category (alleged abuse situations).

Although the agreement was worked out between the

White House and the SSC without consultation with the FBI, the

Intelligence Division believes it is workable and is certainly

better than the situation which currently exists where there

is no agreed-upon procedire established for the conduct of

interviews of current or former employees.

SSC FOREIGN TRAVEL

The CIA was informed by Senator Walter F. Mondale,

a member of the SSC, that he intended to travel to Europe to

inspect some of the l

The White House, and particularly

Mr. Roderick Hills, was very concerned about this type of

trip feeling that it could cause all sorts of problems with

friendly

JEK A

JEK AC

6(11 (B)

Mr. Colby felt that Act

such trips had been arranged for in the past involving

congressmen and that some good came out of such trips.

The

Committee discussed the pros and cons of the contemplated

trip by Mondale and possibly Senator Gary Hart, also a member

of the SSC, and decided that the purpose and procedures for

such trips would be discussed with Senator Church by Mr. Colby

and a senior official of the Department of State.

NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES

The SSC has asked Colby for detailed briefings as

to how National Intelligence Estimates are prepared by the

United States Intelligence Board for the NSC. Colby contem-

plates giving a rather detailed briefing to the SSC on this

procedure accompanied by several senior officials of the

Intelligence Community Staff.

The focus of the interview would be mail openings,

• covers and intercepts. This has been determined to be an—

abuse-area.

Despite the fact the Department is examining various

types of mail surveillance with the view to possible prosecution,

Michael Shaheen, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,

has determined that SA Kehoe's furnishing information on this

subject would not impede the Department's inquiry.

On August. 5, 1975, SA Kehoe was advised of the above

and that he should be available for briefing at 7:45 a.m.,

August 8, at Room 4509 in the Justice Building.

SA Kehoe said that he would probably be represented

by private counsel during the interview and planned to invoke

the Fifth Amendment: He asked whether this would prejudice

his position in the Bureau.

SA Kehoe was told that the

decision as to whether or not to invoke the Fifth Amendment •

was his alone to make and that under no circumstances would

it be used to his detriment in the Bureau.

Mr. Seymor Fred Phillips

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D. Co

Room 4063

Dear Seymor:

if on

Attached for your information is a memo on my staff interview

in G-308 August 11, 1975 in accordance with our conversation.

While there was no indication as to recall, I would appreciate

a return note from you to confirm that you

received the memo and

to suggest an a, b, o procedure in the event that I get a call

to return for any additional staff type interview. Secondly,

if the Executive committee or others send a

formal subpoena,

as you indicated I need to know a definite a, b, o procedure

with phone numbers to best represent all our

interests. I look

forward to this message.

The attached material is not in the order of the questions as

asked. The questions were disconnected and left one with a

feeling of incompleteness. I think the main thrust stands out

clearly.

Since Mr. Hoover had publictyl stated during those years that

we were engaged in a certain amount of technical surveillance,

could elaborate properly on certain associated

phases without encroaching on the records. I hope the materiali

will be of interest to you. Please excuse

the dubious typing.

MEMORANDUM

August 12, 1975

TO: SEYMOR F. PHILLIPS

FROM: R. L. MILLENN

SUBJECT: SENATE CONMITTEE on INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

I. BACKGROUND

Telephonic request was received 8:40 pm August 5, 1975

from Michael Epstein to appear in Room G-308 NSOB August 11

or 12 for a staff interview. Air travel was confirmed August 6.

Appearance was made by the writer 11:45 am to 1:30 pm August 11,

in the presence of Mr. Epstein and Mary DeOreo. Advised of staff

interview rights.

II. INTERVIEW PROPER

A. Personal Background

1. Q. When did you leave the FBI?

A. December 30, 1965.

2. Qo How long in the FBI?

A. 1938 to December

3.

personally constructing radio stations and

travelling for months at a time, however, my

office of assignment remained in Washington.

4.

Q. Where did a non lawyer background fit?

A. Prior to WW II the Bureau began to need additional

help to manage the placement of two way radios in

cars, construct point to point emergency radio

stations to handle communications in case of war,

disaster or nationwide communications strike, en-

gineer, design and construct voice communication

systems for all the field offices as well as the

writing of specifications, reviewing of bids, testing

and installing the hardware in the field. This work

fell outside the usual capabilities of law trained

agents. In 1943, the individual efforts of the

several engineers were solidified into a Radic

Engineering Section placed under the FBI Laboratory

for

administrative purposes. From the beginning, the

mission of this group was that of a service and sup-

port section rather than that of operations. Cases

were worked by field agents under supervision of

their office and the appropriate interested divi

sion supervisors at the headquarters. Field cases

as such were only a section concern when equipment

supply was inadequate of a breakdown occurred.

this event we would be called upon to move equipment

about or correct the defective unit.

Aó Yes, I was cleared Top Secret.

6.

What would represent the longest time that you would

be away from your office while section chief?

A. Ipree weeks.

C. Knowledge

"of other Persons

1. Q. Does the name William Campbell mean anything to you?

A. Yes, I believe he was a specially trained agent of

the Washington Field Office.

2. Q. Did he work in the section?

A." Not while I was there:

3. Qo Did he work in the section for a long period of

time on loan from somewhere else?

4. Q. Coula he have worked in your section on special

assignment without your knowledge?

A. Unlikely that this would occur.

5° Who is R' F. Pfafman and how is it pronounced?

A. Pfafman was an early scientist in the Laboratory

from Purdue. He was initially hired as an

electrical engineer. He retired during my tenure

as section chèef.

6. Qi Where does he live?

to 1965 I had

my own space in Couct E of the Justice Building

with my irregular hours making car pooling an

impossible situation.)

D. Relations with Others.

Q." What was your

relationship with w. C. Sullivan?

A. I knew of him as an Assistant Director in charge

of Domestic Intelligence División. As a section

chief of another division I had no occasion to

deal with him. His activities appeared to be along

speech making and editorial lines.

2. Q. How many times did you go to his office?

A. None.

3. How many times did he come to your office?

Hi Q. Didn't he disagree with Parsons as to the role of

the adequacy of the Laboratory scientists?

A. I believe that at one time he challenges the

adequacy of the Laboratorys' contact with outside

concerns. If that is what you had in mind, all I

can say is that I prepared an outline of the con-

tacts which we had and they were most impressive.

They ranged from all the military research est-

blishments through the commercial radio and re-

search companies such as Texas Instruments, etc.

Our section actually excelled in this type of

contact to "keep abreast" of a rapidly changing

Ileld. I heard no more irom farsons or others

after submitting my list:

5: Qo Who assisted

I you during your tenure as section chief?

A. J. Baker.

E. Training•

Q' Did your people furnish any training to field agents?

A. Special training was furnished to selected agents

so that they could serve as contacts in each field

office, alerting the section to parts needs, check-

ing the readiness of field equipment, advising of

equipment needs, aiding in the input

field budget preparation by the section as well

as assisting in planning. These agents, in the

main also

carried their full case loads and were

under the local Agent in Charge, not the section.

F. Recording Facility.

1. Where was this facility physically located with

regards to your office?

A. Physically separated by being in another corridor

across the Justice Building.

2. Q. Not in the 7114 corridor?

A. Correct.

3: Q. Were agents offices attached thereto?

A. les, a couple of bays.

4. Q. Who

had access?

A. Corridor doors were locked at all times but agents

access with keys. Facility doors were locked

separately within that space.

5. Q. Was someone in that space at all times during the

day?

A. Most of the time. We tried to keep someone available

## Page 201

in the space in that neither Baker or myself were

qualified to operate the patch panel and recording

equipment and a Directors speech might have to be

recorded on short notice. This was somewhat difficult

in that the work assigned to these people in the form

of security checks for government officials tele-

phones and room security checks for such areas as hearing rooms

necessitated that the work be done outside of the

office space•

6. Q. Were these men fully occupied?

A. Yes.

7.

Q. How did you know they were fully occupied?

A. By an administrative assignment system, kept one

year and then destroyed after statistics were com-

piled. Also by closely following the work load

and making adjustments to keep the 3 to 4 hour

overtime on an equitable basis.

3 Qo How do you know that someone couldn't make a

'composite" tape without vour knowledge - and give

a specific example of why not.

A. As pointed out earlier, I was not present 24 hours

a day and therefore could not continuously mon

itor the displaced space. Within reason, however,

for statistical purposes we needed to document our

input. This was done by assignment slip as it came

through the office by Baker or myself and in some

instances the paper work was done confirmatory

when. the work was started on an urgent assignment

orally. An effort was made early in the time period

as section chief, in 1955, 1956, to clearly

establish this procedure thereby avoiding persons

bringing work of any kind directly to a section

employee. The staff was repeatedly made aware of the

desired procedure. The only specific instance I

can recall occurred early in my tenure, possibly

in 55 or '56 when it was necessary to personally

challenge someone outside the section who was

bringing work directly to a section employee. What

the work was is not important. The bypass of pro-

cedure was. I was called by phone and went im-

mediately to the studio area on the other side

of the building and advised the person that the

proper procedure was not being followed. The person

departed and no further problem existed.

9. &. Who was this person?

A. I believe it was Inspector Kemper.

10. & Who called you in this instance?

A. I can't recall that detail 20 years ago but it

would probably have been someone normally

assigned to that area, such as Matter or Corbett.

11. @ Could it have been disc records or album material?

A. It could have been but the material was not the

prime concern.. the procedure was.

12. Q. Was a memo written?

A. No. The immediate action corrected the problem.

13. Q. Would a "trained" field agent be

able to

operate filter equipment?

1o NO.

14. @ Would Matter be able to operate filter

equipment?

A. Yes.

G. Procedures:

1. Q. If a request to handle material came from a

field office would it have a case caption?

1. Yes, to identify it with files and with the

ivisions supervising the case

2ö Q. Would you ever receive recordings from an

outside source?

A. Yes. Periodically from the military on crashes

of test planes, as for example where the pilot

was trying to tell what was wrong but the

•in-

telligence on the tape recording made on the

was garbled by over riding noises.

Filtering techniques could, at times, success~

fully bring out the message through time con-

suming procedures In these instances, because

of the excessive manpower demands it was necess-

ary to borrow radio engineers aná

trained Washington Pield personnelto work on thaby

separate small portions of the quéstioned tape

3. 8. Die rou here anyth

to expedite the report back to the contributor.

3. Q. Did you have anything to do with codes and

ciphers?

A. None, handled by another section.

4. 0.

What about field recordings?

( Note: Since Mr. Hoover had announces in

public that at one time some 98 technical

surveillances were in operation, it follows

that the Bureau had some training and operated

some equipment in this area of operations.

A. All offices were self sufficient with regard

to

playback and recording equipment. In Kidnapping

cases, for example, the equipment would be

needed on an immediate basis, hence, in my view

when needed from another office or request that

the headquarters in Washington send what they

need. Accordingly no "stock" was held here. The

field inventoried and maintained

• it.

H. Martin Luther King.

1. Q.

Did you know in the period around 1961 that the

Bureau was investigating Mr. King?

A. No, as a support or service facility we would

not be envolved in field work unless there were

equipment or support problems. None were

recalled.

2. Q. Did you instruct that a "composite" tape

be made

on Mr. King?

A. No.

3.

Q. I have inferences that you did. Did you?

A.

I did not.

4. Q.

Is it possible that someone could make a tape

without your knowledge?

A. It is possible, but not a probable situation.

As indicated, the section was in two separate

parts with the voiceprint, filtering, recording

and related test equipment located across the

building away from my office. Possible, of

accounting of our work from an administrative

and statistical standpoint to assist in just-

Ilying our existence and our programs to the

satisfaction of the inspection staff.

5. Q. Have you since heard of investigations of Mr. King

A. Through media references

A. I did not.

tigations or Matters"?

A. I did not.

I. Miscellaneous Items.

1. Q. Did Mr. Hoover have technical recorders?

A. I recall none during my tenure of 1955-1965. He

was basically opposed to technical things in

that he tended to avoid those items which he

1id not fully understand. Accordingly, much

administrative effort was expended in explain•

fully understood.

2. ITEM. A long list of names was observed. Some

questions about,

people came from this list

such as Pfafmans reference.

3. ITEM. The period of interest appeared to be in

the 1961 or thereabouts era. It is noted that

the person being interviewed is being asked to

recall details occurring 14 or 15 years in the

past.

For purposes of identification in this memorandum,

my name is George G. Moore, former Special Agent of the FBI

having retired July 31, 1974. My address is 6715 Horth 27th

Street, Arlington, Virginia, telephone number 533-8288. In

MH 55138

On July 28, 1975, I appeared at the new Senate Office

Building for a 2:00 p.m. Interview with Mr. Loch Johnson, a

Staff Member of the Senate Select Committee, concerning the

Huston paper.

Although the interview was originally set up for

2:00 p.M., ve spent a total of 45 minutes looking for an office

space in which to hold the interview. Mr. Johnson was consider-

ably embarrassed with the snafu of his clerical staff not

providing him with room keys in the former Carroll Arms Hotel

already occupied by other Staff personnel. After approximately

30 minutes, I suggested that perhaps we would save alot of time

if he conducted the interview in the park across the street.

He seemed receptive to this suggestion; horever, ve could not

Find a park bench. We proceeded to Senator Church's office

and arrangements tere made to use the Senator's personal office

located in the Capitol building itself.

At the beginning of the intervier, Vir. Johnson did

not place me under oath or indicate that I tas under subpoena.

He also did not advise me of my rights and right to counsel,

although he was avare that a representative of the Bureau

(Supervisor L. F. Schwartz) was standing by in the Senate

Office Building for consultation if needed by me.

The folloring vere key points which I recall covered

during the intervier.

Initially, he asked me for a brief statement of uy

background which I provided. He was very much interested in

knowing the extent of my acquaintanceship with Mir. Huston

prior to the June 8, 1970, (a Monday morning) leeting in the

Director's office. I informed him that I had met Huston no

more than to times prior to that meeting and possibly once

when I had briefed him at Mr. Sullivan's suggestion in

Division 5 conceming extremist activities covered by the

-2 .

## Page 272

section under my supervision. Such briefing was not a long

briefing and I diù not recall any further details including

who might have accompanied Mr, Huston. Next, he desired to know

if I had ever prepared a paper for Mr. Huston which indicated

the extent of the extremist threat in the United States. I

did not recall preparation of any such paper at this time other

than the overall paper prepared at the Director's (and President"s)

instructions in the Sumner of 1970, known as the "Huston Flan."

He asked me that I considered to be a true assessment

of the extremist threat at that time and I informed him the

paper which vas tritten tas an accurate statement of the threat

as known to the FBI together with the input fron other intelligence

agencies.

He seemed interested in the foreign aspects to this

threat and asked for my assessment in that regard and endeavore

to have me label it as significani, nonsignificant, moderate

and similar adjectives. I refused to label it and stated that

the threats spoke for themselves and it vas for others to

interpret in that regard although I did point out that there

was and has been and possibly still remains a degree of varying

proportions of foreign influence in these movements. I

emphasized that the word was "influence" and not knowledge

of any control.

He asked whether I felt the President was correct

In believing that the quality of FBI intelligence in this area

was low.

I informed that it was my recollection that President

Johnson likevise had been critical of the overall data of

FBI Intelligence in this area and ve in the FBI who collected

such intelligence knew fully well that our intelligence product,

although good in some respects, left much to be desired. In

other words, there vere definite intelligence gaps.

"ext overall point covered was the meeting in the

Director's office on lionday, June 8, and his desire to receive

from me a feel of the tenor of the meeting since I was one of

the participants.

I informed him of the nature of my attendance which

was a last minute notification by Mr. W. C. Sullivan tho

stopped by Branch Chief Joseph A. Sizoo's desk (which I was

manning at the time) and asked me to go with him across the

street to the Director's office. He did not tell me why and

did not brief me ahead of time. After getting there, it was

obvious I was taken in order to prepare a memorandum of the

event. (This was obvious to me since I was much the junior

man in attendance.)

Mr. Johnson was interested in a rundown of the

meeting itself to the best of my recollection and I provided

him a few of the details including the fact that Admiral Noel

Gayler (phonetic) of the fational Security Agency (ITSA) was

about five minutes late and the Director started the meeting

on time without him. Also, during the meeting the Director

gave a very brief rundown on the mandate of the President,

which was to identify intelligence gaps through a cooperative

effort letting the chips fall where they may and affording

the President a good hard-hitting report which would allow

him an opportunity to make some hard decisions. Somewhere

in this meeting the comment was made about a lack of cooperation

on the part of the agencies, and the Director looked Mr. Helms

in the eye and said that he was not aware of any lack of

cooperation on the part of any of the agencies and Mc. Helms

agreed with the Director in spite of the fact that llaison had

been curtailed a short time prior to the meeting by the Director

with CIA.

an i tines

One other item of interest furnished was

the fact

that Admiral Gayler used this meeting as an opportunity to

make a request of the Director that he hoped the FBI would

help NSA out by engaging in surreptitious entries regarding

embassies. The Director gave him no hope in this regard

pointing out the risks involved and the climate of the times.

dictated that this matter be given very careful study before

any hasty decisions tould be arrived at. # (5)

Mr. Johnson asked IF I was aware of a flap which

occurred at this meeting in which Mr. Huston allegedly informed

the Director that the guidelines for the study were broader

than announced by the Director in his presence. I recalled

no such flap and informed Mr. Johnson that a memo was vritten

by me of the meeting which was sent to the Director which

hit the highlights of the meeting. He asked if this vas

available in Bureau files and I answered that I assumed so.

Mr. Johnson was very much interested in the meetings

and discussions which took place at Langley, Virginia (CIA's

hone), and wanted to know who desired meetings to be held there.

I emphasized to him that I was not privy to any plans of that

sort and only functioned from that time on as a member of the

WH 55138 DocId: 32989634 Page 275

CONFYSSTING

working committee primarily because the Section I headed

was involved in domestic extremist activities.

He desired to know of Huston's input into these

meetings and of any flaps which occurred and in particular

he mentioned someone told him of a flap involving Army. I

informed him that Huston did not seem to be running the meeting

as Sullivan seemed to be doing that in his position as Chairman

and I knew of no flaps that occurred vith any members.

I also mentioned in response to a question that

Mr. Helms did attend the first meeting at CIA Headquarters

and merely welcomed us to their space and offered any assistance.

He left and never returned after a few remarks.

Johnson asked several questions involving the format

of the report utilizing options for the President and asked

for my knowladge of how such a report vas decided upon. I

told him I had no knowledge; he was asking the wrong person,

He commented about Part 3 being only one recommendation

and wanted to know if that was unusual and I responded that I

had never been invoived in a paper for the President before

and I did not know whether such vas unusual or not. I also

commented that I felt that the options in and of themselves

= 7 -

were in the nature of recommendations at the President's l

pleasure.

Johnson was especially interested in whether other

agencies were desirous of using this whole operation as a

means of utilizing illegal techniques which vere at that time

denied and also if the FBI representatives Ilkewise approached

this task vith more than usual enthusiasm with the expectance

that they too would be allowed to use techniques some of which

were obviously Illegal.

I told him that I could not speak for other agencies

and that there were better people to speak with on that score

but as far as my feelings as a representative of the FBI were

concerned, we all approached it as a difficult task involving

hard work, in vier of a short deadline, and a project on vhich

the President, the Director and Assistant Director Sullivan

vere riding herd. At the same time, from a personal standpoint

I felt that "hope always springs eternal" and that maybe, , in

view of the high-level interest involved here, from an overall

standpoint we might be provided vith some investigative

tools which would allow us to do a better job. At no time

was there any discussion to my recollection as to whether

any technique was legal or illegal bearing in mind that

everybody at the table was a professional from an intelligence

point of view who made up a working committee and the matters

of that nature vould be policy matters involving officials

on a cabinet level or higher.

I was asked the question as to whether or not

extremist field personnel ever utilized covert mail examination

techniques. I told Johnson I felt he was getting beyond the

scope of my clearance from the Bureau for this interview and

he stated that he did not think so since one of the options

involved had to do with this matter. I inforned him cather

than belabor the point that we in our Section's

work did not engage in this technique but I vould refuse

to go any further with respect to my knowledge.

He asked me if I had any knowledge of what developed

after the report was prepared, apparently approved by the

Fresident, and then later recalled. I told hin that I had

no knovledge of a personal nature and very poor hearsay, which

was gathered through rumor, and later accounts from the press

that the Director allegedly took the letter to the Attorney

General who had it recalled.

He also asked me for my knowledge of how the

Director made his footnote decisions. I told him I did rot

know but felt that lir. Sullivan was the person who would know

and have first-hand knowledge. He asked me if the Director

discussed it with Mr. Jolson. I told him I did not know

but that he may have in view of the relationship.

He also was interested whether I had knowledge of

a difficult situation which Mr. Sullivan might have been in

at this time as chairman of a committee acknowledging intel-

ligence gaps on the part of the FBI and also occupying a

position thich would entail loyalty to the Director. I

agreed that Mr. Sullivan vas in a delicate position.

He also asked me fos my opinion as to that lesson

could be learned from the Huston papers and I stated that

very little, if any, good could be learned from the papers

themselves but I did hope that after Congress was finished

with its investigation brought about by the Watergate syndrome

that the best interest of the country would be preserved in

the sense that ve don't loose sight of the fact that there

are legitimate national security interests which need to be

protected and that there will come a time in the future when

the people who are in power, whether it is Executive Branch,

Congress or both, will be asking the same questions with

respect to intelligence gaps and will have to make some hard

decisions.

He also asked me if there was any advice I could

give as to reforms which could be initiated and I responded

that they were talking to the wrong person about reforms. It

seemed to me as

if they had enough reformers in Congress

today.

He did not ask me who was present at the meetings in

Langley as he said he had full knowledge of those who were

present but he did name to me those he felt vere present and

at that time asked me if there vere any individuals in addition.

I mentioned that I was not sure whether I. J. Smith was present

or not. He mentioned D. E. Moore, W. C. Sullivan, C. D. Brennan,

R. D. Cotter, I. 0. Gregar and F. J. Cassidy, as vell as myself.

He also mentioned that he had heard that the report

consisted of 90 percent Bureau information and asked me 1f

that was correct. I said I had never put a percentage figure

know who he talked with and certainly felt that Mr. Kelley

vould take the same stand if he was called for intervier. I

further stated that there is a definite relationship between

security investigations and criminal violation responsibilities,

many of which go hand in hand and as the terrorist threat

continues in this country and possibly explodes, ve vill see

more of a reason for security and criminal divisions to work

closely together.
