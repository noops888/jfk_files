MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Sam Jaffe Phone Call to John Gittinger.

1. On 13 February 1976 retired CIA psychologist John

Gittinger called me at the office to say that he had been

contacted by Sam Jaffe and

asked to provide information on

Nosenko's present whereabouts.

He also

asked Gittinger if

he was

aware of Nosenko's

charges against Jaffe and of in-

formation on Jaffe in some Soviet documents which CIA had.

2. Jaffe had called Gittinger at'his home on 11

February and again the evening of 12 February.

He declined

to say who had given him Gittinger's phone number and con-

nected Gittinger with Nosenko.

Jaffe claimed that he had

met Gittinger

in 1960

in connection with the Powers/Abel

exchange with the Soviets.

Gittinger told me that this was

impossible since he had not been involved with Powers in

any way, but thatl

had been the psychologist who

dealt with the Powers problem.

Jaffe recounted the story of the accusations against

him and their effect on his livelihood, and said that he

felt that he must clear himself by getting to Nosenko

directly.

He told Gittinger about the DCI's memorandum

which cleared Jaffe of KGB agent involvement, but said that

the FBI still questioned Jaffe's bona fides.

He asked

Gittinger if he really thought

Nosenko was

still in danger

from the Soviets.

Gittinger told him that this was absolutely

true and Jaffe said that he doubted this.

4.

Gittinger gave Jaffe no intormation and, in fact,

is in no position to help Jaffe either to further refine

Nosenko's information or to help Jaffe find Nosenko. Gittinger

kind of confused story whichlJaffe

has about Gittinger's involvement with Nosenko most likely

originated with Jim Angleton.
