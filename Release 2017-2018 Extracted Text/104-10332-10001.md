(sent to Lee 1/28/97)

This completes the ARRB request for the Alvarado polygraph tapes. I will advise the FBI that the CIA has no objection to the release of

the tapes. The tapes will be returned to the FBI for release to NARA via the ARRB. HRG would like a copy of the cassettes for the

Agency's JFK assassination retention file.

Thanks to everyone who worked on the request.

Barry

ARRB Request: Alvarado Polygraph tapes

(sent to Lee 1/28/97)

Alvarado Ugarte, a Nicaraguan, is a key figure in the Oswald/Mexico City investigation. He was interrogated (including

polygraph) jointly by the Mexican Police and CIA. Extensive information about the interrogation, including the Agency's written

Polygraph report (IRD#66032), has been released to the public under the JFK Act. Copies of the polygraph tapes were found in the

FBI's JFK files and referred to the HRG. The ARRB staff has requested the release of the tapes.

Does the DA /OS have any objection to release of the tapes? Listening to the tapes will require some old equipment.

According to the file, the tapes should play back satisfactorily on a 60-cycle machine (reel-to-reel) ublizing 60-cycle current.

JFK reviewer Joe Murphy (31842) is the HRG focal point for this request

CIRB, OS has been our point of

contact for JFK request in the past. If you have any questions about this request, please give me a cal (31825).

(6) OPS/Information Management Branch coordinated this request with OPS/Polygraph Division. According to Polygraph Division

records, the Federal Bureau of Investigation sent the reel-to-reel tapes to OPS/Information Management Branch in

1993 with a request to destroy them. The tapes were forwarded to Polygraph Division where they were transferred

to cassettes (still maintained in Polygraph). Apparently, the originals were returned to the Bureau. In 1993 a

Polygraph Division officer listened to the tapes and deciphered as much as he could. According to Polygraph

Division, there is no compelling reason to object to the release of these tapes; the only consideration might be

revelation of methodology or tradecraft. However, the risk is low given the sessions were conducted more than 30

years ago. Polygraph Division will continue to maintain the cassettes unless otherwise directed.

(U) Given the above information provided by OPS/Polygraph Division, OPS/Information Management Branch has no objection to the

release of the tapes.

(U) Please advise this office if additional information is required regarding this matter.
