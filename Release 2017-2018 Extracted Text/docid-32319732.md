Mr. Bryant:

JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT

OF 1992 (THE ACT): PUBLIC LAW (P.L.) 102-526

DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS

classified "secret" in its entirety.

Attached are copies of: DOJ 11/23/93 memo, FBI 11/4/93

memo, your note to Director Freeh dated 12/14/93, and a letter

from Mrs. Morris Childs' attorney dated 12/7/93.

We advised DoJ we intend to release information from

the CPUSA investigation, the two principal SOLO assets and other

assets, and various

technical surveillances; and that at least

one document would identify these two Solo assets.

The DOJ

memorandum noted these releases would affect the processing of

all other CPUSA records in response to FOIA requests; and once

the two SOLO assets are publicly identified they can no longer be

protected as confidential sources in other CPUSA files, although

some of the information may be withheld for other reasons.

DOJ believes it is in the national interest to release

the SOLO story, but since Attorney General Bell decided in 1981

that the SOLO operation should remain classified, Attorney

General Reno's approval is necessary for the proposed

declassification of the SOLO assets.

The Attorney General will

be advised of the proposed release of other information set out

in our 11/4/93 memo, and asked to consider whether any change in

classification policy should be publicly announced by her and/or

the Director.

DOJ requested assurance that Director Freeh has

been fully briefed on and concurs with the FBI's proposed

release.

DOJ will seek AG approval to proceed.

Meanwhile the

FBI is not to release information set out in our 11/4/93 memo.

On 12/27/93 Unit Chief Ron Klein and SSA Carl s.

Valentine

net with Gerald Schroeder of DOJ's OIPR to discuss the

status of

this matter.

We came to three conclusions: 1)

that no

information could be released until the AG has decided whether to

declassify information as we suggested; 2)

that no response to

Mrs C

Childs letter be

Intormation saner ying sending a decision o preliege; and

that the Director be fully briefed on the expected

ramifications of our release.

It is noted that Mr. Gallington mentioned this matter

to the Director at a

recent Christmas party:

Released under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 USC 2107 Note).

DATE: 11-14-2017

SECRET

December 14, 1993

Director Freeh:

JOHN. E. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT

OF 1992 (THE ACT) ; PUBLIC LAW (P.L.) 102-526

DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS

flassified "secret" in its entirety.

Under the stringent requirements of P.L. 102-526 we

have processed documents which are ready for release.

These documents contain information which reveal that

we had investigations and sensitive coverages of the CPUSA

headquarters, and foreign establishments such as the Tass News

Agency in New York and the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D. C.,

including pre-FISA technical coverage on lass.

Other documents indirectly identify our two principal

SOLO assets who acted as liaison and were an integral part of the

funding mechanism between the CPUSA and the Communist Party of

the Soviet Union.

Both are deceased, but the widow of SOLO

asset, Morris Childs, requested by attached letter that we not

release any information that reveals the relationship of herself,

her husband and brother-in-law with the FBI until six months

after her death.

A response to the letter is being prepared.

Mrs. Childs is writing a book about the SOLo operation.

Morris Childs died, Gus Hall, head of the CPUSA, advised an asset

that he had learned that the

FBI attended the funeral services,

therefore, he knew Morris Childs had worked for the FBI.

No damage to ongoing operations will result from these

releases. Minimal damage is done to national security interests.

Every effort will be made to release all information

that does not harm national security interests.

The Attorney

General

advised of the above by

the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review because pre-FISA

electronic surveillances were authorized by previous Attorneys

General... These coverages and information from two of the SOLO

sources have been the subject of Attorney General claims of

Privilege in

past legal actions against the FBI.
