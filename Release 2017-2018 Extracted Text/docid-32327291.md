I-1 said that RENE RAYNERI, on January 14, 1958,

in the presence of commander JORGE, disclosed that there

being

"exceedingly good" and as more than satisfactory

to meet their needs, but he did not confirm that there

were to be exactly three boats, nor did either he or

RENE disclose the identity of these boats, nor the place

of embarkation.

Commander JORGE disclosed to the informant that

the men on this expedition would be armed very much 11ke

United States units; that four medical doctors will

participate in the expedition, and that there are high

Cuban Army officers in Cuba who have pledged their

expecting a replacement for himself to

arrive in Miami,

of the July 26 Movement in

Cuba feel that this replacement 1s unnecessary as this
