"IS AMERICA GOING MAD?"

BY HOWARD FLIEGER

30878 GEH

The Daily Telegraph of London used the

above question as the heading over its

main editorial on January 3.

The editorial began:

"It is time America's friends spoke out with

some nasty questions to the so-called 'liberal'

east-coast establishment. By that we mean sec-

tions of the press, sections of Congress, televi-

sion commentators and comedians, university

pundits and a lot of other people who may

think there is a dollar to be made out of

denigrating their country's institutions and

leaders.

From that takeoff point, the newspaper's

• comment went'on:

"The United States should know' that her

European cousins and allies are appalled and

disgusted by the present open disarray of her

public life. The self-criticism and self-destruc

tive tendencies are running mad, with no

countervailing force in sight.

"Please, America, for God's sake pull your-

self together."

really developed the record of secret and sor-

did goings-on which culminated in the resigna-

:tion of Richard M. Nixon. It was the diligence

and thoroughness of congressional committees

and their staffs during weeks of painstaking

, work that built the case for impeachment.

Certainly, Congress, ought to maintain a

watchful oversight on the activities and perfor-

mance of all the departments and agencies of

the Government. The public service must be

held accountable to the public it serves, and

Congress is the proper place to see to it.

But both the quantity and quality of investi-

gations are beginning to raise doubts in the

minds of many, including some of the mem-

bers of Congress.

For example, there have been half a dozen

separate investigations of the Central Intelli:

gence Agency-each often calling the same

Witnesses for the same testimony, and going

DAILJ/05/805i

Andy Postal, Staff Member of the Senate Select Com-

mittee and who has been working closely with Senator John

Tower, Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee, advised

that Senator Tower would like to meet with the Director prior

to his testimony on Monday, 1/26/76, to discuss oversight

matters and the Director's viewpoint on this topic.

10

Postal was informally advised of the tone of the

Director's statement, intended to be given by the Director

before the. Senate Committee on Government Operations, and in-

dicated that this was in line with Senator Tower's thinking.

According: to Postal, Senator Tower is alarmed that ene

ner committes is being created fox oversight in addition to the

already existing oversight Committees for the intelligence;

community and that oversight legislation proposed so far

would just create another committee for the Bureau or other

agencies to respond to.

Senator Tower is concerned that the FBI, with its

wide-ranging investigative responsibilities most of which are

UNRECORDED

not of an intelligence nature, might be forced to report to any

new committee created not only on intelligence matters but also

Senator Tower feels that it

is next to impossible to separate the intelligence functions of

He viewed

would be given exclusive oversight jurisdiction of the FBI or any

other segment of the intelligence community

MR. CHAIRM!, I APFRECIATE TULS OPROPTUNITY TO COVENT

THEIR CONCERN WAS CLEAR TO HE -- DO NOT WEAKEN OR DESTRCY

AS YOU IION, I SHARE THIS CONCERT. IT WAS THE OVERKIDENO

FACTOR IN MY DECISION IO ACCEPT A LEADERSHIP ROLE. IN THE SELECT

COLMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE.

THE SELECT COLMITTEE HAS PURSUED. THE INQUIRY MANDATED

BY'S. PES. 21 IN A MANNER BEFITTING ITS CRITICAL INPORTANOO

TO THE NATION.

BUT: IT WAS PERFAPS INEVITASLE THAT THE SUR-

DANGER OF A PROFOUND ADVERSE IMPACT UPOT TIE NATION'S INTELLI-

IT HAS SADLY BECOME FASHIONABLE TO PLAY POLITICS WITH

SECRETS. TO DISAGREE WITH À SECRET OPERATION OF THE CIA, ANY-

MORE, DOES NOT MEALT TO CONSIDER QUIETLY THE COURSES OF ACTIO:,

BUT, RATHER, TO MINT DARKLY OF IT, OR TO DISCLOSE IT TO THE

MEDIA.

AGAINST THIS BACKDROP OF SPREADING CONCERN FOZ OUR CON-

TINUING INTELLIGENCE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE CLEARLY MANDATED

WILL OF THE SENATE THAT PROBLEMS AND ABUSES BE IDENTIFIED AND

CORRECTIVE ACTIOT RECOLLENDED, WERE WARRANTED, THE IMPIATIO

TO INVOKE. EXPEDITIOUS RESOLUTION IS JUSCIEIABLY PRE3ENI.. IT

ILAS BEEN ARGUED THAT ESTABLISIMENT OF A SINGLE

INTELLIGEYCE

OVERSIGHT COMMITTEN IN EACH HOUSE NOULD LINIT THE OPDORTUNITY

FOR DISCIOSURE WILLE AXIMIZING THE CHANCES FOR CLOSE MONIDORING

AND OVERSIGHT OF INETTLIGENOE ACTIVITIES.

THIS APPROACH IS THE CORDERSTONE OF TUR POSTCION ADVOCATED

BY THE CHAIRMANT, I AM NOT PREPARTO. TO ACCRPE THE LLOTSLATION AS

DRAFTED BY THE SELECI COLFITTES. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SERTOUS

ANALYSIS WILL RENSAI, II TO BE BOTH A PREMATURE ALL STELISTIC

SOLUTION TO AIT EXTRENTLY COMPLICATED SET OF PROBLE!IS.

IT IS PREMATURE BECAUSE MANY OF THE PROBLENS IDENTIFIED

BY OUR INQUIRY RAISE QUESTIONS OF THE CORRECTHESS OF CURRENT IN-

TELLIGENCE COMINITY ORGANIZATION - PROBLEMS. TRICH THE FRESIDENT

HIAS INDICATED HE WILT, ADDRESS IN AN UPCOMTIG REORCATIZATION PRO-

POSAL.

IT IS SINPLISTIC BECAUSE IT ASSUMES THAT INTELLIGENCE

ACTIVITIES CAN BE HEATLY DIVORCED. FROM OTHEP. ACTIVITIES OF THE

AFFECTED AGELICIES AND DEPARIMENTS AD THAI AN ATTEMPT IO VEST. IN-

TELLIGENCE JURISDICTION IN A SINGLE COMMITTEE IS VORKABLE VIDER

On 1/2/76 Dr. Joseph William Magee, a former

Special Agent who retired in 1965, was interviewed by SSC

Staff Member Michael Epstein.

During this interview Magee

told Epstein of his recollection of an obscure news

story of

an event in North Carolina a number of years ago when it was

developed that some of Martin Luther King's associates had

illegally sold a number of rental automobiles and that the

news account indicated that no prosecution was

authorized by

the Department of Justice, possibly on the basis that the

Department of Justice did

not then want to disrupt the civil

rights activities öf King's associates.

ENCL FILED

Mr. Wannall advised that Mr. Adams requested/in-

tormation in Bureau files relating to the above statement by

former SA Magee.

Intelligence Division personnel handling SSC

requests regarding Martin Luther King, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) and related files were canvassed

and it is believed the below incident is the one to which Mage

is referring in his statement.

Andrews allegedly stole four automobiles for subsequent sale

to the SCLC, headed by King.

Investigation disclosed one of

these stolen vehicles had been in possession of Hosea Williams,

Director of Voter Registration of SCLC.

Due to the ramification

involving SCLC and the civil rights movement, the Criminal

Division of the Department of Justice directed prosecution in

the case rather than the U. S. Attorney in Atlanta 5 1 296

Andrews and Finley were convicted on ITSP charges

that the Department and the Assistant U. S. Attorney in Atlanta

strength to warrant prosecution. The investigation was closed.

It is also noted that on 6/20/66 our telephone

surveillance of SCLC was discontinued upon receipt of instructions

from Attorney General Nicholas de B. Katzenbach.

Katzenbach

was concerned about jeopardizing the possible prosecution of

Williams on ITSMV charges in connection with the Andrews case.

Pat Shea, Senate Select Committee Staff Member,

advised on 1/12/76

the recommendations of captioned Committee

concerning Congressional oversight of the intelligence community

have not been

finalized as of this date. Shea, who is responsible

for the preparations of the Senate Select Committee in this area,

has been discussing the various options relating to oversight

available to the Committee with other Congressional Committees,

representatives of the White House and various components of the

intelligence community. Complicating the Senate Select Committee's

recommendation concerning oversight is an internal dispute in the

Senate between the Rules Committee and Government Operations Com-

mittee as to which should have initial review of oversight recom-

mendations. At the present time, it appears Governmental Operations

will review the recommendations.

Additionally, the Senate Judiciary

Committee and in particular Senators Tunney and Kennedy object to a

new oversight Committee of the Senate having jurisdiction over

domestic intelligence activities.

They advocate

the new Committee

be limited to foreign counterintelligence operations and the

Judiciary Committee would exercise oversight over the remaining

areas of Bureau operations.

Shea stated he believes that the ultimate recommendations

by the Committee will be along the lines of the position taken by

the Judiciary Committee. He is aware of the problems in defining

what is foreign counterintelligence and what is domestic counter-

intelligence and of the complications in the creation of an over-

sight Committee with a limited mandate would cause especially in

view of the limited percentage of Bureau operations which might be

subject to the review of that oversight Committee. He also

expressed

his view that the Bureau budgetary set up currently does not allow

for a separate review of counterintelligence expenditures.

He suggested that it would be appropriate for Bureau

matter with the White House and Senators on the Senate Select

Reference is made to SSC letter dated January 19,

1976, requesting certain materials from the FBI and SSC

informal memorandum dated January 30, 1976, from Mr. John

Elliff.

Material pertaining to the authorization and purpose

of SAC Iotter Number 63-27 (F) consists only of a memorandum

from Mr. F. J. Baumgardner to Mr. H. C. Sullivan dated May 29,

1963, captioned "Investigations of 'Rightist or Extremisti

Groups."

A copy of this document is attached with this

memorandun.

No material could be located which would reflect

interest or knowledge of this matter by the Attorney General,

the President, officials of the Department of Justice, or the

White House Staff.

Regarding the request for material reflecting Bureau

authorization of all investigations conducted pursuant to the

above-mentioned SAC Letter, it should be noted any such

request fron a Field Office would have been submitted under a

substantive case caption.

There would, therefore, now be no

feasible way of identifying any such instance without a

review of a tremendous number of investigative files main-

tained at FBI Headquarters.

Additionally, contact with

knowledgeable Bureau officials at FBI Headquarters concerning

this matter failed to ascertain any instances wherein the Bureau

authorized investigations in response to instructions contained

RE: UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO

STUDY GOVERITENTAL, OPERAIIONS WITHI RESPECT

TO INTELLICENCE ACTIVIFIES (SSC)

JBS rovcaled a file was opened during 1957 upon receipt

of a publication of the JBS which had been forwarded to FBI

Headquarters by the founder of the organization. Our Boston

Office was instructed during 1959 to obtain background data

concerning Robert 1. Il. Welch, Ji-, founder of the JBS, and

to renain alert for information concerning Welch's alleged

anticormunist activities io insure these activities did not

encroach on the Bureau's jurisdiction and responsibilities.

The Boston Office conducted no active investigation of

Welch, but did furnish background information concerning hin

which had been obtained from a copy of the 35th Reunion Report

of the Harvard Law School Class of 1922, published in 1957,

• Volume 4 of "Who's Who in New England," dated 1948. The

preponderance of the file, which is now quite extensive,

consists of correspondence from the public. Neither the

JS nor its founder, Robert H. l. Welch, Ji., has been

the subject of a Burcau security-type investigation.

Information concerning the "Hinutonen," which organization

was also nentioned in the lay 29, 1963, mamorandum, in not

being proviced pursuant to the desiros of tr: Elliff, as

orally expressed on January 22, 1976.

A review of information contained in Rureau

files rogarding the organizations and individuals set forth

in the informal nemorandum of vir. Elliff dated January 30,

1976, revealed no Bureau investigations were authorized or

conducted on these organizations

and individuals pursuant

to paragraph two of SAC Letter 63-27 (P). Iu. Elliff, on

January su, 1976, requested the review of files on this

subject matter be limited to investinations conduotod in

accordance with instructions in the above-mentionod SAC

, the activitles or these groups do not

come within the scope of the Bureau's investigative responsibility.

However, the tact that some oi these groups are anticommunist.does

not nitigate against our checking on them if their activities.

warrant it. Whenever we receive informacion on any "rightist or

extremist"

group vitose activities are suspect, we check to see if

the group's activitles come within the purview of Executive Order

10450 or are in violation of any Federal statutes over which the

Bureau has investigative jurisdiction.

In this respect, we have

checked into the background of the John Birch Society (JBS) and

• "Minutemen,"

We checked into the background of the JBs because

of the scurrilous attack on President eisenhower and other high

Governent orticials by the society and its founder Robert Welch.

We checked into the background of "Minutemen" because it reportedly

was collecting arms and ammunition and engaging in military type

training to overthrow the Government of the United States.

Our

check revealed the purpose of the "Minutemen" organization is not

to overthrew our Government but to overthrow a communist government

in the event the communists take over the Government of the

United States. We clearly established the activities of these two

groups do not come within the purview of Executive Order 10450 and

are not in violation of any Federal statutes coming within the

Bureau's

jurisdiction.

There are "rightist or extremist" groups operating in

fields other than the anticommunist field. For example, we are

investigating the Nation of Islam which is an all Negro,

violently

antiwhite group that teaches hatred of the white race.

In addition,

the General Investigative Division has numerous organizations under

Investigation, such as the American Nazi. Party,

OBSERVATIONS:

It is believed the policy we have been following con

cerning captioned groups in the anticommunist field is sound.

However, It is believed we should re-emphasize the necessity or

the field to be alert to the formation of such groups; to turnist

the Bureau with the identities of such groups; and to investigate

the activitles or such groups, where warranted, under the appropriate

substantive violation.

The field should also be reminded that anti

communism does not mitigate against checking on a group if it is

engaged in unlawful activities.or is in violation of Federal statutes

over which the Bureau has investigative jurisdiction. Accordingly;

ail SAC letter has been prepared in this regard.

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended thai the attached proposed SAC letter

be approved and transmitted to the field. No Manual or Handbook

changes are necessary.

Reference is made to the December 18, 1975, SSC letter

forwarded from the Department of Justice by letter dated December 22,

1975, containing requests for information from the FBI; Director,

FBI, letter to the Attorney General of December 24, 1975, which

enclosed a memorandum for forwarding to the SSC; and to a confer-

of the Intelligence Division and SSC representative Mark Citenstein.

The following material is submitted pursuant to the

Committee's request as modified at above-referenced conference of

January 8, 1976.

Generally speaking, in discharging its obligation, the

Bureau has three roads open to it in the handling of its responsibility:

1. Initiate no action until after the fact; wait until a

criminal/violent act has occurred, then attempt to solve the crime

and bring those responsible to prosecution.

2. Initiate prosecution at the "conspiracy" or "attempt"

stage thus thwarting the commission of more serious crimes and

acts of violence expected to occur.

3. Take some action, other than arrest and prosecution,

Governmental Operations with Respect

-

Often, a consideration which militates against seeking

prosecution before or after the violence occurs (in addition to consid-

erations of the protection of life and property) is the continued future

usefulness of the source of information, or that informant's refusal

to become publicly involved to the point of giving testimony.

In August of 1965 a leader of a Ku Klux Klan faction in one

southern state, on at least three separately reported occasions in one

month, called for acts of violence to be committed "regularly" within

that state. This leader, additionally, had been the individual who, it

was reported, gave the instructions which resulted in the slaying of

three civil rights workers in his state.

Though an interview is a legitimate law enforcement

function, this leader was interviewed, not as a solicitation of infor-

mation,

but so that the opportunity could be taken to advise him of

the FBI's knowledge of his activity; to advise him of the FBI's ability

to observe all his activities by surveillance and otherwise; and to

encourage him to reseind his call to violence for the continuation of

which, he was cautioned, he could be held accountable.

Thus the Bureau chose to attempt to deter a violent

course of action. (This leader was later convicted of complicity in

the above-mentioned killings.) Further, the exposure of informants

unwilling to testify publicly but who proved to be continually useful

was avoided by this tactic.

During the summer months of 1969, San Diego, California,

experienced a series of civilian-police confrontations and a "near riot

situation. " Investigation, including informant information, indicated

that a group of Black Panther Party members planned travel within

California to participate in the San Diego disorders.

U. F. Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations with Respect

To Intelligence Activities (5SC)

To prevent individual participation in riots or other con-

frontations with police, interviews were conducted directed toward

informing the interviewees of our knowledge of their potential

participation and of the elements of the Anti-riot Laws and other

statutes.

Further investigation was conducted into the possible

mode of travel of those coming into San Diego so that local police

could be advised of time and place of arrival and, in cases involving

use of aircrait and weapons possession, so that appropriate arrests

could be effected.

In choosing to take a course designed to prevent violence,

two factors could be considered: the controllability of the results of

our action, and the possibility of violence not to a subject's target,

but to the subject himself.

Thus, a suggestion that groups known to have engaged in

violent acts by the use of firearms be surreptitiously supplied with

ammunition "doctored" to prevent its effective use but which would

explode and render inoperative any weapon through which it was fired

was turned down because the possibility of accident or use by those

not intended as our targets could not accurately be controlled or

predicted.

A demonstration to protest the Vietnam War was planned

in Washington, D. C., in October, 1967. In conjunction with the

demonstration, a plan was devised whereby a pilot was to fly daringly

low over the Pentagon to drop flowers at the precise moment demon-

strators were to attempt a forcible entry into the Pentagon. The

attempt was aborted when a Special Agent was successful in convinc-

ing those responsible to select him as the pilot to accomplish the

mission. Two hours before flight time, those responsible for the

plan appeared at an airport in the Washington, D. C., area with 200

pounds of flowers ready for the flight, but, as the Special Agent-pilot

never showed up, there was no other course at that juncture than to

abort the mission. A plan was thus thwarted which could well have

resulted in tragedy had another pilot accepted such a dangerous flying

mission and violated Federal or local regulations in flying low over

the Pentagon which is also in the heavy traffic pattern of the

Washington National Airport.

(It should also be noted that the potential for violence, had

this group chosen to add explosives or other damaging material to the

200-pound package of flowers unbeknownst to the pilot, was similarly

thwarted, )

Where potential for violence is the consideration, the

question of immediacy becomes paramount. Thus, in one of the above

examples, a direct, face-to-face interview was the chosen course.

Where that potential for violence is less imminent, techniques to

discourage an action have been considered.

As an example, in the early part of 1966, when it was

recognized that Ku Klux Klan-affiliated factions were engaging in

violent behavior of various sorts, an effort was made to reduce their

willingness to engage in such acts by removing the veil of secrecy

under which these factions' members operated. Post cards bearing

a caricature of a sheeted Klansman were mailed to members and a

national Klan leader told a national newspaper that, as a result,

members were "embarrassed" and that there was "dissension in the

ranks, " a most disruptive elfect.

There violence is advocated by an individual before his

group or is a representative of a group, there are other approaches.

In the summer of 1000 a national Klan leader, speaking at a idan

rally before a large crowd, announced that it was "present han policy"

to shoot FBI Agents appearing on a Klansman's property. To pre-

vent policy from becoining fact, a statement reporting these remarks,

explaining Federal law relating to the assault of Federal agents, and

exposing the "bypocrisy" of the iSlan's attempts at presenting a "non-

violent pablic image, " was prepared and made available to the news

Laedia, thus exposing to publie scrutiny (and scrutiny by less ailitant

mempers) such a blan policy. (Reproval from Influential Klan

oificers was a desirable tangential eitect.)

The above examples way not necessarily meet the

proposed guidelines for preventive action draited by the Departient;

however, these practical situations may be of assistance in developing

more comprehensive guidelines.

Director Sec'y

This memorandum responds to Director's inquiry

Oi Assistant Director Mintz as to whether recent Senate Select

Committee (SSC) request pertaining to allegations against FBI

is sufficiently outside scope of SSC's mandate to merit a

Bureau protest.

SSC letter 1/8/76, signed by John T. Elliff, forwarded

list of five allegations of

misconduct and abuse, and requested

responses to nine questions for each of five incidents --

questions 1 - 8 to be answered by Bureau, number 9 by_Department.

Letter also requested that answers to questions 1 +7 be

"accompanied by full back-up documentation, ineluding memoranda,

inspection or investigative reports, 302's, persomel reporte

and communications to and from the field."

and

accompanying material attached to this memorandum.)

On 1/12/76, W. 0. Cregar of Senstudy 75 Project

conferred with Elliff to clarify request as to one of the

allegations. In the ensuing discussion Elliff said that the

purpose of this inquiry is to learn what information is

provided to the Attorney General (AG) consistent With his

oversight responsibilities once an allegation suriaces in

In responding to the questions raised by the

SSC, the only back-up documentation the SSC desires are

involved was surfaced. ST. 115

In view of the limited documentation being requested

to support any protest to the ssc.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re :

SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

a protest is merited relative to the 1/8/76 request although

Allegation Number 4 relates to an organized crime matter and

therefore could be considered questionable as to falling within

the mandate of the SSC in Senate Resolution 21.

The key here is

the

meaning of the term

"intelligence activities" as used in

the

Resolution. At the

outset of our handling of SSC requests,

we had thought that the SSC would be looking into only our

security work but learned soon after inception of Senstudy 75

that the SSC's interpretation of "intelligence" was broad

and could include all our work, security as well as criminal.

On this basis, we have been complying with a number of ssC

requests having no security ramifications but rather relating

Interestingly,

the thrust of

the ssc inquiry has been in the security

AREzeLd and Its request.

relating to criminal work have been a bear minimum anc

apparently very selective as to situations it desires to

look into.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is interesting to note that according to Elliff,

the SSC interest in what we furnished the AG on these

allegations is confined to after the allegations were publicly

surfaced, not when we first learned of them.

One would think

that the

SSC would be interested in what we

did to advise the

AG when we first learned of the allegations, not just after

public surfacing.

We, of course, are responding to the SSC

exactly as requested but recognize there could be a follow-up

request for information as to when we first advised the AG,

It is further observed that

the request in question is typical of many of its requests in

"shotgun" in approach and,

Like many others, has required consultation with the sso

to clarify, modify or narrow original requests.

If not, was any other action taken?

3.

How was the decision made to conduct lor not to

conduct) an inspection or investigation, or to take

(or not to take) other action?

4.

Which Division, or operating level (headquarters

or field), conducted the inspection or investigation?

Director Sec'y —

• At 9:43 a.m. on January 2, 1976, a caller identifying

himself as Dr. Bill McGee, formerly employed as a chemist in the FBI

Laboratory, advised that he retired in 1965. During September, 1975,

he received a telephone call from Mike Epstein of the Senate Select

Committee, who said he wanted to interview McGee about the FBI Laboratory.

Epstein said that he obtained McGee's name from William Sullivan, but

he would not specify the particular subject matter proposed for the interview.

Arrangements for the interview were never completed.

McGee received a second telephone call from Epstein on

December 29 or 30, 1975, at which time Epstein implied that he had

spoken with Ivan Conrad, former Assistant Director of the Laboratory,.

but he would not disclose what if anything Conrad had said. Epstein

again requested McGee to be available for interview and McGee agreed to

appear at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, January 6, 1976. McGee said that

he still could not learn the proposed subject matter of the interview and

in view of the fact that he feels bound by a secrecy agreement, he executed

while employed by the FBI, he requested that the Bureau contact Mike

Epstein to determine the proposed subject matter of the interview and then

advise McGe as to those subjects concerning which he could be relieved

of the obligation of secrecy. McGee said that his office telephone number

where he could be reached on January 2, 1976, is 525-0764, and his

residence is 538-4085.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee

McGee also advised that he had spoken with Seymor Phillips

who told him that the Bureau had given the House Committee on Intelligence

Mc Gee's name in connection with their inquiry concerning the U.S. Recording

Company. McGee said he had no knowledge of that matter.

RECOMMENDATION:

Office of Congressional Affairs will contact Epstein, determine

the subject matter of the interview, and appropriately advise McGee.
