On 7 January' I contacted Tichborn who suld that he could be in

WashIngton on 14. January and that he rould have to return to los Angeles

by 3 February. I asked him what his fee vould be and he said that 1t

ves his understanding that he has previously talked in the neighborbood

of 51, 500 to 31,600. I countered by saying that in vlew of the shortness

of this trip I did not feel I could do any better than $1, 300, which he

accepted.

I unked hin 1t he desired that we advance him any money at

this time or 11' he could buy his ticket on the cuft and that we would

make some. sort of arrangements while he was in Washington, and he

sald he would buy his ticket and that he would abide by whatever

procedures we normally follow. I told him at this tine that I would
