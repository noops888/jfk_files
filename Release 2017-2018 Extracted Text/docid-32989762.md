that the

13, 1967, he was sitting in the lobby of the

asleep and overheard a conversation, in English, between

two

Negro couples.

This source advised that it appeared that the couples

had prearranged plans to meet at the Holiday Inn, possibly to

eat,

and source does not believe that they were registered, as

he

did not see them before or after.

The source said that from the conversation, at least

one couple appeared to be from California, as they were comment-

ing and comparing Governor Reagan to the former Governor Brown.

Source could recall no descriptive information con-

cerning one of the couples, but he stated that the man who did

could pee.

ly an associate of Martin Luther King, Jr., and formerly an open

advocate of violence, was to "hit" King during the Washington March

this spring, so as to place the blame on a white

man in the march.
