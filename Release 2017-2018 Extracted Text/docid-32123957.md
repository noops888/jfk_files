ANTIAL

It is noted that MARINA OSWALD identified the

bracelet as a gift to her from her husband; that she stated

that the bracelet was given to her immediately after OSWALD

had returned from New Orleans early in October, 1963; and

that OSWALD had purchased a similar bracket for himself

with his name on it prior to the time they moved from

Dallas to New Orleans in the spring of 1963.

She stated that OSWALD wanted her to have a

bracelet like his; that he had not stated where he bought

the bracelet, and

that she did not know he had gone to Mexico.

The lead for the Dallas office is set forth because

the above information presents the possibility that if OSWALD

bought a bracelet

with his name on it prior to leaving Dallas

for New Orleans and since he wanted a similar one with his

wife's name on it, he purchased the secona bracelet where

he purchased the first, probably in Dallas, Texas.
