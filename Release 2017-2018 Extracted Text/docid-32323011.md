On 2/11/60, SA W.HARLAN BROWN received in person

a typewritten report fron DI-?-S, dated 2/11/60, and which bas

been serialized as 134-4A-309.

Informant advised that on 1/18/60, the regular Dallas

CP meeting was held at the home of JOE and MARGARET LANDIN,

2230 Roanoke Street, Dallas, Texas.

Those present were BILL

LOWERY, RUTH LOWERY, AUGUSTIN ESTRADA, and the LANDINS.

Informant advised that BILL LOWERY said he would dis-

cuss the CP's recent national convention. He volunteered to do

this because he was the only one receiving the "WORKER." ESTRADA

CP be brought up on its feet. AUGUSTIN ESTRADA suggested that

they have an "educational" at every one of their future meetings.

The

members agreed to this, and the discussion of the National

Convention of the CP would be their first educational.

Informant said he learned that BILL LOWERY inquired as

to how HAROLD and BETTY MANN stood with the Party; that he had

recently looked for them and failed to find them, but had

located HAROLD MANN's father, who told him where

the MANNS lived.

BILL LOWERY said he would make an effort to locate them soon,

as he wanted to know their status, because at almost all of the

State Committee meetings inquiries were made of the Dallas

group concerning the MANNS' status. LOWERY asked, were they or
