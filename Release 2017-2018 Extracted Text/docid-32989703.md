He stated he expected to be suspended as a student for his

activities on the campus and that he expected that if this

that i hi

happened, the students would begin a strike or perhaps take

even more militant action.

In this regard, he stated that

no Young Socialist Alliance members would be permitted to

be arrested if at all possible and that if anyone was to be

arrested or suspended that he would be the one since he is already

about to be suspended and therefore has nothing else to lose.

that revolution could take place in the next few days was

According to the source, the crux of

his presentation was that the manner in which society will

be changed from capitalism to socialism will be feasible

only when the masses of people are indoctrinated and

educated into changing their minds about the present system,

In his talk,

he claimed that socialism was the only source of justice

organization capable of winning.

In discussing the recent

stealing property which was theirs.

He said that they had

worked for poor wages for so long and productivity was taken

out of their sweat and that they were thus justified in

stealing.

(Mount Clipping in Spoce Below)

BERKELEY, Calif. -Peter Camejo, a

spokesman for the Socialist Workers Party

who just returned from a three-month visit

to Cuba, addressed an overflow meeting of

250 at Dwinelle Hall at the University of

California here April 4.

The discussion at the meeting centered in

large part on the SWP's disagreement with

the Cuban leadership on the invasion of

Czechoslovakia (which the Cubans criti-

cally endorsed and the SWP opposed) and

on the SWP view on the need for the de-

velopment of structured workers' demo-

cracy in Cuba. From the lengthy discus-

sion, it was apparent that the great major-

Ity favored the SWP position of supporting!

the Cuban revolutionary governmentwhile

presenting its own independent and, in some

cases differing, views on various issues.

The previous day, Camejo spoke on the

achlevements of the Cuban Revolution to

a rally of 500 students in the Sproul Steps

free-speech area. Every Bay Area TV sta-

tion and several radio stations covered this

meeting.

On the initiative of the Young Socialist

Alliance, the Berkeley Independent Socialist

Club, which holds that the Castro regime

is reactionary, has agreed to an open de-

bate of the Cuban question. The debate will

be held on May 9 at the University of

¿alifornia. .

rally to protest "opposition against our movement in France"

would be held on June 28, 1968 on Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley.

CAMEJA stated

that interference by police would inevitably

result in a riot.

Refusal of the Berkeley City Council

to condone the demonstrations resulted in three evenings

of rioting on June 28: 29, and 30, 1968. Throughout the

in a face-lo-lace panel at the University of California yesterday, the city's top official

During the three days of protest, 198

singled out and charged with "conspiracy

to commit a misdemeanor," which is a

felony with a penalty of three years in jail

and a $5,000 fine. The other 195 were

found guilty of trespass with a maximum

penalty of 10 days and a $300 fine. The

actual acts cited against the three defen-

dants are speeches at a mass public rally,

and the chairing of an open meeting.

According to the conspiracy law, if a

misdemeanor is committed during a dem-

onstration, the leaders of that demonstra-

tion can be indicted on a felony charge

" conspiracy to commit the misdemeanor."

The "conspirators" do not have to havead-

The April 15, 1968 issue of "The Militant" contained

an article reporting a gun battle between members of the

Black Panther Party (BPP) and the Oakland, California Police

Department in April, 1968.

The article reported that BOBBY

JAMES HUTTON, a BPP member, was killed in the gunfight.

The article quoted PETER CAMEJO as saying, "It is very clear

that BOBBY JAMES HUTTON was assassinated by the Oakland cops.

This is a sase of vut-and-out murder, just like Dr. KING's

murder in Memphis, only in this case

it was done by the cops.

HUTTON's murder clearly demonstrates the immediate need to

remove all cops from the ghettos and to replace them with

democratically controlled, deputized ghetto residents, who

would protect instead of brutalize Afro-Americans."

"Our job is to build a radical movement. To quote the Cuban

to move along with it--we are movement people acting as

journalists.

"The 'Guardian' takes a strong left position, but it

is not identified with any organized
