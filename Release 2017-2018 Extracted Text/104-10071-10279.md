in Hoscoke

How will this affect the

operation?

We are afraid thit

MOSEr wili be suspected of participating in sone sort of clandestine

activities and that she was

rather close to

lin Erussels for an

extended period of time;

that her continuous efforts to recontact

will nost likely not go unnoticed; and that!

nay become suspected

of having clandestine relationships with MUSBY,

causing" him to come under

surveillance.

Even If the MVD determines that this relationship

will still have a black mark on his record and possibly

be prevented from ever going to the West arain.

Even if the results of MOSBY's

activities in moscow are not as diastic as outlined above, we foar that

will feel that the Als has failed to protect him and the opcration,

and he therefore micht break contact with us.
