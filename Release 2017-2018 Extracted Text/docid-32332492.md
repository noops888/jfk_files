The

title of this case has been marked "changed" to include

and one of whose members, NOEL SALAS, was captured in Cuba

with BLOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO.

The name Alianza Revolucionaria

is also being added to the title, since the combination of

the NFE, ALPHA 66, and MRP frequently refer to themselves

by this name:

Several members of the Federacion Estudiantil

Universitaria (FEU) are active with the SNFE, but the FEU,

as a group, 1s not, and is of such minor significance that

it is not being included in the new title.

interview RAFAEL FRAGA and SERGIO DIAL, Who were report-

edly sent from New York to Florida to join the military

section of the SNFE.

DIAZ and FRAGA are two of the

Cubans who participated in the SNFE walk from New York

City to Miami.

In view of the capture of GUTIERREZ MENOYO

in Cuba on January 23, 1965, it is not belleved that in-

terview with DIAZ and FRAGA would be of value at the

present time, and these interviews will not be conducted,
