MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT: Your meeting with the Foreign Intelligence Advisory

Board at 4:00 PM today

Mr. Clark Clifford, who has been Chairman of the President's

Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board since April 1963, will introduce

his Board members and explain the work of the Board. He is

expected to emphasize the Board's recommendations on how to im-

prove counterintelligence activities, including suggestions as to

revision of the existing procedures

used to prevent the Russians

from penetrating our intelligence organizations.

Since 1946, there has been a group under various names to

advise the President as to intelligence problems. The current

group was asked by President Kennedy to dig deeply into how the

intelligence agencies operated in the Cuba situation. The Board's

general charter includes the xia review and assessment of the

objectives and the conduct of all our foreign intelligence activities.

It is advisory to you and is in a position to make judgments as to

how well our foreign intelligence work is being done, independent

of judgments made by Director McCone and other intelligence officers.

Suggested questions:

1. Would the Board undertake to make an independent judgment

as to whether the intelligence organizations, especially the military

agencies, are reflecting current instructions to economize and

hold down the number of persons employed?

2. Would the Board suggest to me ways of speeding up the

work which is now going on in connection with the consolidation

of intelligence activities and the reduction of overlapping programs?

3.

Does the Board review as to whether Congress has a

legitimate need to know more abour our intelligence activities

than is now provided to the appropriate committees?
