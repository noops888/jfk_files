Your reguest

for investigation of the activities

of Hawthorne and other United States citizens mentioned in

your nemorandum of February 9,

1967, has received careful

consideration and it is noted

you desire an investl-

gation and possibly interview of a number of individuals

who are now allegedly closely

associated with Premier

Lynden O. Pindling in the Bahamas. (5)

The requested investigation appoars to relate

directly to the internal affairsy of the Bahamas since

you have advised that there is a

question with respect to

the extent to which Nr. Pindling and his ministers should

be alerted against maintaining undesirable associates.

As a recult of a careful review of

the intormation avail

aro not indicated to be in violation of laws within our

jurisdiction and, further, that it appears that the named

individuals are

most frequently found in the

would enable the Burcau

noted, too, that the subjects in whom you have

expressed

an interost are most frequently found in the Bahamas.

Effective interviews by the FBI of these Individuals in

connection with internal matters of the Bahamas, an area

in which we have no jurtediction, would be inapprenutate. (5)

Your referenced letter

â€¢ also advises of allegations

indicating the subjects may have been interested in the

trafficking of arms.

In this connection it is pointed out

that jurisdiction over such

activities insofar as they

relate to the United States is within the jurisdiction

of the Bureau of Customs, in the Treasury Department. (S)

In conclusion,

it appears that this is a matter
