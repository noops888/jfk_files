1. Transmitted u.'er separate cove is a copy of the sable mentioned

In paragraph 3 of Reference C.

As will be seen, the text of this cable

differs & beat deal fron that surister in deference A.

We discussed the

Reference A suggesting within the sation, d, 1a essence, with USXA7J/9.

We came to the conclusion that suen a stror, persa.a: attack on UiS!ArJ/19

would probably accomplish little since UNSNAEJ/19 nad already sen in his

version to Favana and could be expected te :'ve the backing of ost or all of

the Paris Embassy personnel - despite nilo clairs to the to....."¿ aade

privately to UNS:AFU/9 by UNSNAFJ/24 aid AluhID/2. Also considered, especially

by üNswArU/9, was tie possible effeu?, such ction sight have on MIASH/h.

ASNAFU/9 was, and still 13, very "-luctant to take any action which miz

dversely erfect ABKASH/1 or fo:ce AMLASH 1 into a position not of his ou

choosing, 1.e., to have to take up the defense of JiS AFU/9 without being able

to choose his on time and place.

2. We are trying to get the ilory into the press here, as stated is

Reference C, and will advise you of any results obtained.

A dispatch on the

subject of plarning for UNStrUg will be fortheoing shortly.
