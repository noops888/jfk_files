LA COSA NOSTRA, aka.

00: New York

As a result of a series of articles by Charles

Grutzner of the "New York Times" service which are being

carried in Canadian press, there has been a flurry of

activity concerning comments of Canadian law enforcement

officers on the Canadian ramifications.

Attached are clippings from the Toronto "Globe

and Mail" of May 9, 1967, and the Montreal "Gazette" of

May 10, 1967.

There have also recently been charges leveled by

the former Justice Minister Claude Wagner of Quebec that the

La Cosa Nostra has infiltrated the concessions at EXPO-67

in Montreal.

He has named the following companies as those

to which he

has reference:

Fleur de Lys Vending Machines, Inc.

New System Towel Supply

0 Bront Meat Market

Margie's Flower Shop

Enclosed in this regard are clippings from the

"Ottawa Citizen" of May 6, 1967 and the Toronto "Globe and

Mail" for May 8, 1967.

This matter was checked with the NCIU Unit of RCMP

on 5/8/67 at which time they advised they had no information

to confirm Wagner's allegation but had requested their Montreal

Office to furnish further particulars.

This matter will be

cottoned and gho Darese advised. Bee 20%

Headquarters, advised the writer confidentially that he

had been in consulation with the Solicitor General all

Opposition intended to move a "no confidence" motion

against the Government for its handling of organized

crime, probably at the session on the afternoon of

5/10/67•

The Bureau will be further advised in this respect.
