CENTER for the STUDY of INTELLIGENCE

Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records

Review Board

600 E Street,

NW

Washington, DC

20530

Dear David:

response to your letter of May 1, 1996, this is to

request that two documents acted on by the Board at its

16-17 April meeting be reconsidered so that the postponements

within them conform to previous Board determinations.

The two documents, Nos. 104-10019-10022 and 104-10019-

10023, dealing with Oswald's

activities in Mexico City, are

duplicates of documents previously reviewed by the Board.

Jue to a technical error committed by our reviewers as they

were preparing the documents for release, certain information

was not marked for postponement.

The information in question

concerns details of a sensitive

activity that has been

consistently protected in other documents.

Sincerely,

sha Pereira

John F. Pereira
