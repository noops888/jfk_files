OSCAR ANGULO on 6/17/68, was interviewed by the

Miami Office and was completely cooperative.

He said he

is is

contact with BOSCH, who continues in his plans to bomb

ships trading with Cuba.

BOSCH said his men had planned

so bomb another Japanese ship in Miami but spotted police

security measures and called off this attempt.

On 6/19/68, ANGULO reported BOSCH claimed he has

a man in Nassau, Bahamas, checking charter flights from

Nassau. to Havana.

These flights are used by UN personnel

for travel to Havana,

considering the possibility of bombing one of these

flighis.

Bosch claims he has a Cuban national in Mexico working with

a Mexican airline company and available to put a bomb

on a Mexican airliner when BOSCH so orders

It is hoped ANGULO will be in a position to furnish

further information concerning the time and place of future

targets selected by BOSCH.

with ANGULO and is considering interview of RIVERO,

soliciting his cooperation concering BOSCH.
