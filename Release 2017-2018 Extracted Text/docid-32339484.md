D

22-792-9-B continued

issuance of a Teamsters charter to LOU LASKY, a New York labor

racketeering figure, for the organization of

a New Jersey

factory but he had

directed ANTHONY PROVENZANO, the President

of the Joint Council to issue the charter for that one specific

factory. It appears that CATSNA holds the right of approval

of a charter to himself but once that is granted leaves the

details of the organization

to a selected

subordinates and to

ANTHONY PROVENZANO.

On May 7, 1962, NK 2323-C advised that he had

neard that ANTHONY PROVENZANO, President of Local 560, IBT, had

been the individual who had made the sum of $180,000 available

to (FNU) SILVESTRI, owner of Cabana Club and Palma Room, North

Bergen, New Jersey, which was paid to HAROLD KONiGSBERG, a

Hudson

• County hoodlum, to settle a debt of long standing•

Informant stated that SILVESTRI had been unable

to come up with the money, the operation of the Cabana Club

and the Palma Room would

have been taken over by HAROLD

KONIGSBERG.

After payment had been made, KONIGSBEKG was given

to understand that he should make no further efforts to také

over this property or he would incur trouble from PROVENZANO'S

"goons".

on May 25, 1962g PC1

(protect)

advised (agent not indicated)

that one SAM COSMAN (PH) (apparently

formerly associated with Banking and Insurance Commission of

New York City and is an attorney with offices located in

New York City) had approached the Hudson County Trustees of

Local 560 Welfare Fund early May, 1962, to inform that group

that he was in a position to place the welfare money in secure

real estate values having a minimum return of six per cent.

It appeared that COSMAN has obviously received the recommendation

Of ANTHONY PROVENZANO to approach

: the

trustees in regard to

placement of welfare funds.

the Hudson County Borray 2 trustees to place any monies with

1902, no action has been taken by

COSMAN.
