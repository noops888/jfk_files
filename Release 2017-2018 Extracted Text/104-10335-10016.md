NOTE FOR: The File

SUBJECT: JFK Board Requests

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS

RELEASE IN FULL

2000

On 5 June I called David Marwell to clarify parts of

the Board's first three requests (CIA-1, 2, and 3).

The

following points were made:

- Marwell will arrange to have a Board staffer screen

the

package of several hundred items provided by the

DA in response to request No. 1 The items consist

largely of HNs and HRs that describe organizations

and appointments.

This would preclude the need to

send the entire package to the Board.

- Regarding requests No. 2 and 3, the reason that the

Board has asked us to provide information as to the

the present whereabouts of individuals is to help

the Board determine which names should be released.

For example, the Board may conclude that the name of

someone who retired overtly and is living in the US

could be released, as opposed to someone who retired

under cover and lives abroad.

- If the Board wants to interview someone, a specific

request will be sent to us.

- The background information that we provide on

individuals and crypts listed in the requests is

not considered part of the "assassination record."

The information is used to assist the Board in its

review of documents.

- On 7 June the Board will hold a "formal" meeting

to review

redactions we have recommended.

Re:

Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for

Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

I am writing to memorialize our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of

Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the

CIA.

We discussed the following formal requests:

CIA-1 (Organization materials)

CIA has made records available to the Review Board. The Review Board

staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board

and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to

do nothing further at this time.

CIA-2-5 Complete

CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)

CLA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could

be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the

records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.

CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will

compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then

determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that

should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the "Blakey

version" as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the

documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the

cat bal met fra era thie histories that are of orgiate for renie, and

will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests

where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make

histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review

histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not

discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,

within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to

make available and those that CLA believes should be subject to further

discussions.

Cram's multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram's

history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board

staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board

staff awaits its being made available.

CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff)

CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.

CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)

The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as

they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CIA will report back on

recommended action to the Review Board promptly.

CIA-10 (Interagency source register)

CIA has compiled information responsive to the request. CIA will make

records available within two weeks.

CIA-11 (Duran's original statement)

CIA has been unable to identify to date Duran's original statement. CLA

will make some further attempts to locate it.

CIA-12 (MWAVE materials)

CIA will begin to make materials available on a rolling basis.

With respect to the informal requests, it is our understanding that:

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Spas Raikin. The Review Board staff will

discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is locating a cable number IN 24738 (7 July 62), which is identified in record

number 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630 (Box 34, F 22), p. 2.

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Marilyn D. Murrett. The Review Board

staff will discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is continuing to search for HTLINGUAL records, particularly those

identified in Church Committee index that was provided to CIA by Review

Board staff. CIA is prepared to provide oral briefing on HTLINGUAL.

Please let me know if you have any supplements or corrections. We would very much

like to ensure that these matters are handled expeditiously.

As always, thanks for your cooperation and assistance.

Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Compliance

Program and Requests for Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

I am writing to memorialize the Review Board's understanding of the status of CIA's

responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records

that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board's authority under Section

7()(1)(C)(ii)of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) OFK Act).

It is important that everyone at the Agency who is responsible for providing answers to

our requests for additional information and records understand that the answers will

need to be incorporated by reference into the Agency's Final Compliance Statement.

Essentially, CLA will need to attest, under oath, that it has made all reasonable and

diligent searches and that its answers are true and correct to the extent of the best,

reasonably available information. In this regard, is important to note that when the

Review Board requests; for example, a 201 file, it is not asking that you identity relevant

records within the Sequestered Collection, Rather, it is asking to review the original

201 file in its current and most complete version.'

'The Review Board has no basis for assuming that.a 201 file as it appears in the

Sequestered Collection today is necessarily complete. It is fully possible that a relevant

document was not identified by CIA or the HSCA in 1978-79 and therefore is not.

included in the Sequestered Collection, or that a relevant document that was initially

placed in the Sequestered Collection in 1978-79 may have been misplaced at some point

during the subsequent twenty years. Therefore, in response to requests for files, it is

not sufficient merely to point to places where responsive records appear in the

Collection. On a case-by-case basis, we are very willing to hear your explanations for

the possible burdensomeness of any particular search or your analysis of why a search

As we have written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you

should interpret our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. However, to the extent

that you belleve that a request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have

anticipated, or to the extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our

requests in such a way as to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make

uggestions or seek clarification. However, unless we specifically hear from you to th

ontrary, it is our presumption that CIA will respond fully to the requests as posed

In response to your request, the ARRE staff has now identified six of our outstanding

requests as high priority issues. We would appreciate your forwarding to us as much

responsive material as you are reasonably able to assemble during the upcoming two

weeks with regard to these six issues. We wish to obtain a reasonably complete

response to these requests within one month. These six issues are identified in the text

by double asterisks (**) ?

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving first, the formal requests

for information and records, and second, the informal requests for information and

records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the following points

differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies."

I. Formal Requests.

CIA-1 Organizational Material.

CIA has collected information responsive to this request for Review Board

action. The ARRB staff has identified records that it believes will enhance the

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches.

The Review Board first made this request on September 11, 1995. On September

11, 1995, CIA agreed to make these materials available by December, 1995. On

October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to make these materials available by November,

1996.

We are aware that many of the cables requested are already in the JFK files, but

not all are included. Those that we have not been able to locate in the collection

include: Mexico City Station to Headquarters (Septerber 26-30, 1963);

Headquarters to Mexico City Station (September 26-30, 1963); JMWAVE to

Headquarters (September 26-November 21, 1963); Headquarters to IMWAVE

(September 26-November 21, 1963); and all traffic between the Mexico City

Station and JMWAVE for the periods September 26-October 20, 1963 and

November 22-December 30, 1963.

**CIA-7 Histories.

The Review Board first requested access to several internal CIA histories and to

indices of histories on November 8, 1995. On August 8, 1996, after reviewing a

list of histories that you provided, the ARRB staff designated approximately

sixty histories for which further review was sought. To date, the ARRB staff has

reviewed the seven histories that CIA has made available and has made

suggestions with respect to further processing of those seven histories. CIA

should make the remaining sixty-plus histories available.

CIA-8 Intelligence Community Staff records.

The Review Board first requested information on the Intelligence Community

Staff on March 1, 1996. On October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to report on the status of

this request within two weeks. The Review. Board has not vet received an'

substantive response to this request.

review.' Michelle Combs reviewed the materials and identified some that should

probably become available to the public. The DI has been tasked to locate the

additional publications that have been requested.

CIA-10 Interagency Source Register.

CIA has provided a full description of the ISR, which should now be submitted

as a formal response to the Review Board's request. Once the formal statement is

provided, this request will be complete. (Under separate cover, the Review

Board is sending to you an additional request for information and records, CLA-

17, which provides a list of names that we request you check against the

Interagency Source Register.)

CIA-11 Sylvia Duran materials.

CiA reports that it has exhausted its reasonable leads for pursuing additional

information. CIA has agreed to provide a formal letter for the record detailing

what searches were done and confirming that the responsive document currently

in the JFK collection is a true copy of the original letter. Once this formal

statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CIA-12 JMWAVE and David Sanchez Morales.

On May 22, 1996, the Review Board requested access to "all 201 files, personnel

files, Office of Security files, P-files, or any other files" relating to five persons

**CIA-IR-01 Personnel assigned to post from 1959-64 (see RIF 104-10065-10199).

This request, originally made in November 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up

briefing on April 1, 1997. It is our understanding that the DO believes that it is

not able to answer this request. The ARRB staff does not find DO's response to

be credible. We believe that with all of the resources at the Agency's disposal -

including ready contact with individuals who should be able to answer this

question from memory — this question can be answered." The ARRB staff has

provided suggestions as to how this information could be obtained, including

suggesting the types of files and cables that could be searched.

CLA-IR-02 Location of cable identified in JFK 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630.

The cable was delivered to the Review Board on March 20, 1997. No further

action by CIA is needed.

CIA-IR-03 Full computer search for list of documents in HTLINGUAL file.

CIA should undertake a computer run for all HTLINGUAL documents. All

computer searches for these documents should be documented in a formal letter

for the record.

CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton's files.

The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to

account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that

related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived

controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton's files, the Review Board

believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he

maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to

explore any subjects in Angleton's files beyond those that may have pertained to

the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided

by the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any

additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the

disposition of Angleton's files.

*The ARRB staff has spoken with a retired CIA official who claims to be able to

answer this question from memory, but who refused to do so.

CIA-IR-05 Possible foreign source for records on Oswald.

CIA was informally requested, more than two years ago, to use its contacts to

pursue certain records related to Oswald that were orally described to CLA. The

Review Board believed that, for reasons of security classification of information,

it would be appropriate for CIA to make the initial inquiries rather than the

Review Board. Under separate cover, we are providing documentation of the

action the Review Board has taken to further this request.

**CIA-IR-06 QKENCHANT.

The Review Board seeks information regarding the purpose of QKENCHANT

and its connection with Clay Shaw, Howard Hunt, and Monroe Sullivan.

The Review Board was initially provided some information in regard to this

request that now appears to be incorrect. CIA is now seeking additional

information to correct or to clarify its previous answers. The Review Board seeks

an immediate, full, and accurate response to this request.

CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart.

The ARRB staff has reviewed all records that CIA has been able to locate to date.

During the course of this review, additional questions were raised that you

states: "The substance of the foregoing information [on the assassination of

President Kennedy] was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central

Intelligence Agency..." We have been informed that the DO has no record of a

"George Bush" being in the employ of CIA in 1963 with the exception of Mr.

included George Herbert Walker Bush prior to 1970. CIA should determine

whether George Herbert Walker Bush is the person to whom the memorandum

refers and should provide a definitive statement regarding the scope of its search

and the basis of its conclusion.

CIA-IR-10 IG Reports.

CIA will determine whether the IG's office maintains an index or inventory of its

reports and determine whether the IG's office prepared a report on the handling

of Oswald.

CIA-IR-11 Warren Commission critics.

We are asking that CIA determine whether it possesses any files or records on

Warren Commission critics Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane,

Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher. The Review. Board is not requesting

information per se regarding any FOlA requests by these individuals or any

Public Affairs news clippings?

CIA-IR-12 Contacts with journalists or publishing houses.

The Review Board seeks to determine to what extent, if any CIA might have

attempted to influence any journalists or publishers regarding public discussion

of the assassination. This request, originally discussed in March 1997, was raised

at the DO follow-up briefing on April 1, 1997. The DO had no response and no

time frame for a response.

CIA-IR-13 Office or person dealing with organized crime and Cuba.

The Review Board requested that CIA make a particular personnel file available.

The file was made available by CIA for review. The Review Board will discuss

with you whether any further steps need to be taken.'

"To the extent that CIA possesses FOLA files or records on any of these

individuals, and to the extent that those records contain information that was not filed

with the courts, such records are being requested for review by the Review Board.

**CIA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City Station.

The Review Board has for some time been attempting to determine whether it

has had access to all of CIA's surveillance "take" from the Cuban and Soviet

facilities in Mexico City at the time of the Oswald visit and in the immediate

wake of the assassination. On numerous occasions, the Review Board has asked

whether there was any surveillance take in addition to what is currently in the

collection.

On March 18, 1997, the Review Board provided additional leads to CIA to assist

it in answering these questions. The DO has agreed to check Headquarters

records for the file referenced in HMMW 12454, to search for the crypts cited in

this document, and to search for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches

cited in this document. The DS&T will query its offices for possible records on

Mexico City and Cuba and for the present location of Staff D records. Regardless

of the outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board continues to seek a

full accounting for all surveillance conducted during the relevant time periods.

CLA-IR 16 U-2 fles.

DS&T will provide a folder title print out of U-2 materials for Review Board

examination, check for records filed under Richard Bissell's name, and search for

OSP files. DS&T has also contacted Lockheed for assistance.

CIA-IR-17 DS&T Records on Castro assassination plots.

HRG will furnish the 1967 IG Report to provide possible search query

suggestions for DS&T follow-up.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request

that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for.

information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03

HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude

Formal Requests

**CIA-1 Organizational Material.

CIA promptly collected a great deal of information responsive to this request

and made it available for inspection.

On January 7, 1997, the ARRB staff identified a number of these records that

should enhance the historical understanding of the assassination by providing

background information on CIA records. CIA was to have reviewed the DO and

DS&T organizational material during the spring and summer of 1997 to re

examine some of the proposed redactions. Several documents have been cleared

by the directorate IRO's for either release in full or release with minor redactions.

These are:

-Office of Security Mission Statements for 1958, 1962, 1963, 1966, 1969,

The ARRB staff is willing to consult with CIA as soon as the records are ready to

determine whether they should be designated "assassination records" or

whether they can be made available publicly in a manner similar to the material

from the 1996 Boston trip. CIA should be aware, however, that these materials

,CIA-2 through CIA-5.

These requests have been completed and no further action is needed by CIA.

**CTA-6 Cables and Dispatches.

The Review Board first made this request on September 11, 1995. On

contidiction

September 11, 1995, CIA agreed to make these materials available by December

1995. On October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to make these materials available by

November 1996. Most recently, CIA has stated that these cables are not available

as a chronological group; if it is not possible or is unduly burdensome to retrieve

ARRR

check

these cables, CIA should write a memorandum to that effect.

We are aware that many of the cables requested are already in the JFK files, but

not all are included. Those that we have not been able to locate in the collection

include: Mexico City Station to Headquarters (September 26-30, 1963);

Headquarters to Mexico City Station (September 26-30, 1963); JMWAVE to

Headquarters (September 26-November 21, 1963); Headquarters to JMWAVE

(September 26-November 21, 1963); and all traffic between the Mexico City

Station and IMWAVE for the periods September 26-October 20, 1963 and

November 22-December 30, 1,963.

CIA-7 Histories.

The Review Board first requested access to several internal CIA histories and to

indices of histories on November 8, 1995. On August 8, 1996, after reviewing a

list of histories that CIA provided, the ARRB staff designated approximately

sixty histories for which further review was sought. To date, the ARRB staff has

reviewed twelve histories that CIA has made available and has made

suggestions with respect to further processing of some of those histories. The

ARRB staff appreciates the cooperation it has received from HRG in our review

of the histories. CIA should continue to make the remaining histories available

on a continuing basis in consultation with the ARRB.

CIA-8 Intelligence Community Staff Records.

The Review Board first requested information on the Intelligence Community

Staff on March 1, 1996. On October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to report on the status of

this request within two weeks. While we understand that this request turned out

to be more difficult and complicated than originally envisioned, the Review

Board has not yet received any substantive response.

CIA-9 Intelligence Community Publications on Cuba or USSR (November 20-30, 1963).

The LBJ Library has identified several publications for mandatory review. The

Dhas provided additional documents which were requested. Michelle Combs

reviewed the materials and identified some that should be made available to the

public. No further DI tasking is anticipated on this request.

VA-10 Interagency Source Register, Confident l iespense

CIA has provided a full description of the ISR, which should now be submitted

as a formal response to the Review Board's request. Once the formal statement is

provided, this request will be complete. (Under separate cover, the Review

Board provided an additional request for information and records, CIA-17-Draft,

which provided a list of names that we requested CIA check against the

Interagency Source Register. Several files were requested from this search.

Additional biographical material to narrow the search on several names will be

provided by the ARRB staff.)

Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher. The Review Board is not requesting

intormation per se regarding any POlA requests by these individuals or any

Public Affairs news clippings.' Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and

no time frame for a response.

'To the extent that CIA possesses FOLA files or records on any of these

individuals, and to the extent that those records contain information that was not filed

with the courts, such records are being requested for review by the Review Board.

the reports for August and November 1963. While some of the reports for this

period already exist in the JFK Collection; others, including the reports for

December 1962-April 1964, are missing. We understand that the CIA has done

some research on the missing reports. We request a comprehensive memo on the

creation and disposition of DRE records be provided for the Board. In addition,

we request that the CIA work to discover the identity of "Howard," the CIA

officer mentioned in the DRE files. We request his full name and Office of

Personnel file be provided to the Board.

**CIA-IR-22 "A" File on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

In July 1997, the ARRB staff was shown an "A" file on Clay Shaw which pre-

dated a 201 file. We were also told that an "A" file on Jim Garrison also existed.

The Shaw file was declared to be an assassination record and it was our

understanding that both files were to be sent to HRG for processing. We have

not yet received confirmation from HIRG that the files are in process as

assassination records.

CIA-IR-23 Watch Committee Files.

In his memoirs, George Ball reports that upon first hearing of the shots in Dallas

he called DCI John McCone and asked him to activate the Watch Committee.

McCone replied that he already had. The Review Board requests the files of the

Watch Committee for the period January 1963-May 1964.

CIA-IR-24 Defector File.

The ARRB staff has identified documents on Lee Harvey Oswald from the Office

of Security's "Defector File." It is our understanding that these documents are

now being processed as assassination records. No further tasking on this subject

is anticipated.

CIA-IR-25 Zapruder Film.

The Board has requested any and all records, not previously located in the

Sequestered Collection, on any handling by the CIA of the Zapruder film. In

particular, we are interested in any records of NPIC's handling of the Lapruder

how

film or copies of the Zapruder film in November and December 1963. Apy log

books or indexes which would indicate the individuals involved in the

processing and handling of any assassination films should be inclyded in this

The ARRB staff has reviewed Office of Security files for Richard Case Nagel,

Gordon Novel, Jack Ruby, Harold Weisburg, and Walter Sheridan. The entire

files for Gordon Novel, Jack Ruby, and Richard Case Nagel have been designated

assassination records. Portions of the files for Harold Weisberg and Walter

Sheridan will be designated assassination records. The Novel, Ruby, and Nagel

files should be sent to HIRG for processing. The Weisberg and Sheridan files

should be sent to HRG for ARRB review.

CIA-IR-28 McCone Files.

In August 1997, the ARRB staff reviewed an index for the files of former DCI

John McCone and identified some files to be reviewed for assassination records.

A meeting should be set up to examine these files.

CIA-IR-29 Oswald Lewinter.

In November 1997, CIA provided a preliminary oral response to whether it has

files on Mr. Oswald Lewinter. CIA should document its findings in writing.

Once formal documentation of the completed searches has been provided, the

request is complete.

CIA-IR-30 Cherepanov Papers.

In the fall of 1963, Paul Garbler, Chief of Station Moscow, copied a series of KGB

papers from the American Department of the KGB's Second Directorate which

had arrived at the embassy from Aleksandr Cherepanov. The Review Board

requests to review these papers.

CLA-IR-31 Dulles Calendar.

In testimony before the Church Committee on May 4, 1977, Richard Bissell made

reference to the existence of a calendar for former DCI Allen Dulles which would

reflect all of Dulles' meetings. The Review Board requests the Dulles calendar

for january 1959 through his resignation as DCI on November 29, 1961.

Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to update the Review Board's understanding of the status of CIA's

responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records

that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board's authority under Section

7(1)(1)(C)(ii)of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) 0FK Act).

As we have written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you

should interpret our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. However, to the extent

that you believe that a request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have

anticipated, or to the extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our

requests in such a way as to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make

suggestions or seek clarification. However, unless we specifically hear from you to the

contrary, it is our presumption that the CIA will respond fully to the requests as posed.

Many of these requests have been outstanding for over a year and several for two years.

It should be noted that these requests will be incorporated into the Agency's final

compliance declaration. In requesting these materials, we are not designating them

"assassination records" at this time and we are not requesting that copies be given to

the Review Board.

In response to your request, the ARRB staff has identified an additional eight of our

outstanding requests as high priority issues. We would appreciate your forwarding to

us as much responsive material as you are reasonably able to assemble during the

upcoming month with regard to these issues. We wish to obtain a reasonably complete

response to these requests within one month. These issues are identified in the text by

and also continue to be identified by double asterisks. Plese note that all ARRB requests

for additional information, both formal and informal, are scheduled to be completed by

April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving first, the formal requests

for information and records, and second, the informal requests for information and

records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the following points

differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

Formal Requests

**CIA-1 Organizational Material.

As of February 1, 1998 and with the exception of the Directorate of Operations

records, HRP has provided ARRB with the records identified by the ARRB staff

which have been cleared by the directorate IRO's for either release in full or with

redactions. Consultations are now underway between HRP and ARRB as to the

best means of making these documents publicly available. Additional

consultations are in process with the DO for the release of their records.

CIA-2 through CIA-5.

These requests have been completed and no further action is needed by CIA..

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches.

CIA-7 Histories.

CIA's formal response has been recéived. This request is now complete..

After reviewing a list of histories that CIA provided, the ARRB staff designated

approximately sixty histories for which further review was sought. The ARRB

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-8 Intelligence Community

Staff Records, CIA-12 JMWAVE and David Sanchez Morales, CIA-14 Mexico City

staff is reviewing these histories on a constant basis and continues to make

suggestions with respect to further processing of some of those histories. The

ARRB staff appreciates the cooperation it has received from HRP in our review

of the histories. CIA should continue to make the remaining histories available

in consultation with the ARRB:

**CIA-8 Intelligence Community Staff Records.

The Review Board first requested information on the Intelligence Community

Staff on March 1, 1996. On October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to report on the status of

this request within two weeks. While we understand that this request turned out

to be more difficult and complicated than originally envisioned, the Review

Board has not yet received any substantive response.

CLA 9 Intelligence Community Publications on Cuba or USSR (November 20-30, 1963).

The LBJ Library has identified several publications for mandatory review? The

DI has provided additional documents which were requested. Michelle Combs

reviewed the materials and identified some that should be made available to the

public. These records should be marked for processing as soon as possible.

CIA-10 Interagency Source Register.

provided list of names against the Interagency Source Register. Several files of

individuals were requested from this search. Additional biographical material to

On May 22, 1996, the Review Board requested access to "all 201 files, personnel

files, Office of Security files, P-files, or any other files" relating to five persons

allegedly connected to IMWAVE. In response to this request, CIA has provided

numerous records which were located in the Sequestered Collection. Since that

time CIA has provided the requested files on only one of the five individuals.

We are still awaiting the files on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross, Bart Henry, and Doug

Gupton.

CIA-13 Mexico City Backchannel Communications.

CIA has provided a formal response to this request. This request is complete.

CIA agreed to undertake a computer run for all HTLINGUAL documents in

April 1997. The ARRB understands that an intial response from the Directorate

of Operations has been received by HRP but that responses from other CIA

entities are incomplete. All computer searches for these documents should be

documented in a formal letter for the record.

**CIA-IR-01 Disposition of Angleton's Files.

The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to

account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that

related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived

controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton's files, the Review Board

believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he

maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to

explore any subjects in Angleton's files beyond those that may have pertained to

the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided

by the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CLA. The Review Board requests any

additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the

disposition of Angleton's files.

In addition, the ARRB staff's review of the Mangold v. CIA files designated

additional documents from those files as assassination records. These documents

are: Tab D, documents Nos. 95, 109-116, 120, and 121; and from the Denied

Documents file: documents Nos. 496, 498, 499, 500, and 510. ARRB has now

received confirmation that these documents are either already in the Sequestered

Collection or have been marked for processing.

Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

I am writing to update the Review Board's understanding of the status of CLA's

responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records

that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board's authority under Section

7(j) (1)(C)(ii)of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992,44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) 0FK Act).

We appreciate recent CLA efforts to respond to our outstanding requests. As we have

written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you should interpret

our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. To the extent that you believe that a

request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have anticipated, or to the

extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our requests in such a way as

to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make suggestions or seek

clarification. As has been noted in earlier letters, these requests will be incorporated

into the Agency's final compliance declaration. In requesting these materials, we are

not designating them "assassination records" at this time and we are not requesting that

copies be given to the Review Board. All outstanding ARRB requests for additional

information, both formal and informal, are scheduled to be completed by April 1, 1998.

As noted in your meeting with Michelle Combs on February 27, 1998, we recognize that

some requests, such as CIA-7, are ongoing and will continue. In addition, the ARRB has

formulated some new requests, CIA-IR-34 and IR-35, which should be completed as

quickly as possible.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving first, the formal requests

for information and records, and second, the informal requests for information and

records.

Formal Requests

CIA-1 Organizational Material.

As of February 1, 1998 and with the exception of the Directorate of Operations

records, HRP has provided ARRB with the records identified by the ARRB staff

which have been cleared by the directorate IRO's for either release in full or with

redactions. Consultations are now underway between HRP and ARRB as to the

best means of making these documents publicly available. Additional

consultations are in process with the DO for the release of their records.

These requests have been completed and no further action is needed by CIA.

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches.

CIA's formal response has been received. ARRB is evaluating this response.

CIA-7 Histories.

After reviewing a list of histories that CIA provided, the ARRB staff designated

approximately sixty histories for which further review was sought. The ARRB

staff is reviewing these histories on an ongoing basis and continues to make

suggestions with respect to further processing of some of those histories. The

ARRB staff appreciates the cooperation it has received from HRP in our review

of the histories. CIA should continue to make the remaining histories available

in consultation with the ARRB.

CIA-8 Intelligence Community Staff Records.

The Review Board first requested information on the Intelligence Community

Staff on March 1, 1996. On October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to report on the status of

this request within two weeks. While we understand that this request turned out

to be more difficult and complicated than originally envisioned, the Review

Board has not yet received any substantive response.

numerous records which were located in the Sequestered Collection. Since that

CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton's Files.

The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to

account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that

related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived

controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton's files, the Review Board

believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he

maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to

explore any subjects in Angleton's files beyond those that may have pertained to

Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

I am writing to update you on the Review Board's understanding of the status of CIA's

responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records

that the ARRB Staff has requested pursuant to Section 7(i)(1)(C)(üi) of the President John

F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V

1994) OFK Act).

We appreciate recent CIA efforts to respond to our outstanding requests. As we have

noted in earlier letters, these requests will be incorporated into the Agency's final

compliance declaration. As you know, in requesting these materials, we are not

designating them "assassination records" at this time and we are not requesting that

CIA provide copies to the Review Board. As we have noted, all outstanding ARRB

requests for additional information, both formal and informal, were scheduled to be

completed by April 1, 1998. Although the April 1 deadline has passed, the Review

Board still intends to complete all necessary work on the outstanding requests as soon

as possible. The Review Board is currently in the process of drafting its final report to

the President and to Congress and it considers the issue of CIA requests for additional

information and records a crucial one. At a meeting with the Review Board staff on

July 16, 1998, the CIA made a commitment to complete all but three of the outstanding

requests, formal and informal, by August 1, 1998. Due to Review Board staff

commitments, we are willing to extend that deadline to no later than Friday August 7,

1998.
