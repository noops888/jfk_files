MEMO - 5/25/76

TO:: Dave

Marston

FROM: Gaeton

Fonzi

I returned from Key West

early this morning more frustrated than

tired.

believe) popped up.

initially talked

to Faraldo last Friday by telephone.

After an

hour's conversation with him,

1was. left with the impression,.as

I mentioned then, that he seemed a credible character.

There were,

however, strange. undulations. in his ability to recall.details.

Some

recollections were extremely detailed, others extremely fuzzy.

(He was absolutely sure the number of the plane was CU-T 583; yet

he wasn't too sure about the month or even the year.,. still,

there were no inconsistencies in the details he told Sarah,

those

he told to

me on the telephone

and those he told to me in

person.

And, in fact,

undulations in recollected

details may be a characteristic

of memory after. 13 years.

The basic details remain the same: The incident occurred in the.

late summer months, late July, August or early september, in, he

believes,

1963.

He is absolutely not sure of the year, but doubts

whether he would have remembered Oswald or Ruby if he had seen

them more than a year prior to the assassination.

Faraldo was

in the hospital men Kennedy was killed.

He had had,

I believe,

heart problem.

His recollection of the incident

is

thät it öccurred

not too long before that.

He was manager of the Key West International

Airport then

and

arrived

at work between 9 and 9:30 in

the morning.

The group was in

the

lobby of

the airport when

he arrived.

The lobby

has two parts to it,

the ticket counter. area and the waiting area,

both very small, a glass partition and doors separating them.

The group was in the ticket counter. area,

and most of them remained

in that area all day.

There were between 30 and 40 in the group..

They were, most of the time, in clusters, many sitting in small

circles on the floor, a few with guitars.

They were relatively

quiet, well-behaved and caused no disturbance. Neither, according

to the guy who was janitor then, did. they leave much of a mess.

They were mostly young, boys and girls,

"hippie-looking,"

a few

dressed in

olive-drab

ratigues. taraldo recalls he had a rule

against

being shirtless in the lobby

area (not a general rule sir

most Key West

establishments) and

he did have to

tell a few

,Cof

the guys, presume) who had wandered outside, removed their shirts

in the

heat,

to put them

back

on

when

they returned

to the lobby.

That's one of the

factors which

makes

him sure it was

in the summer.

Faraldo says he learned

talking with a few in the group

that they.

were going

to cut sugar cane and that they

had something to do

with the Fair Play

The leader of

the group appeared

to be a guy with a beard, but

he wasn't an obvious leader barking orders or giving commands.

Although Oswald was a part of the group, says Faraldo, he

was more distinctive than

the others'in

more and appeared a bit nervous. (That, at least, made him

distinctive to Faraldo who was then daily on the

look-out for

potential. hijackers.

Oswald was dressed casually, sport shirt

and pants.

Ruby also

casually dressed, but he spent

of the

time.not mingling with

the group but standing against

the doorway that led

the waiting area torear plane-boarding

area. (There are

corridors;: the airport building.is

rectangular;

the planes

right off

the runway and up to

the building.

Once, as Faraldo reported to Sarah, he saw Oswald approach Ruby

and heard him.ask: "Have.you.heard.anything from the Big Bird

Faraldo recalls

thinking Oswald may have been asking about

when

the plane

was coming in, but he later had doubts about that

assumption when he again overheard Oswald asked others. in the

group specifically about the time the plane was coming in.

Faraldo recalls that a plane finally did arrive late in the evening

to pick up the

group.

He says. Oswald got on the plane with the

group.: He didn't

see Ruby get on and

doesn't know if he did.

At various times during the day, Faraldo wandered around the airport

taking photographs of

the group.

He used a movie camera and a:

35-mm still camera.:

(At first

he

told me he used a Pentax 35mm,

later said he had thought about it and didn't think he had his

Pentax at the time and used either

a Leica or an Argus.)

He

shot the movie film

for WTVJ-TV, a Miami television station, for

which he was a regular

stringer.

and his 35mm

film

He sent both his movie film

undeveloped to Miami with á crew member of

a National Airlines flight,

which was his regular procedure.

His movie: film was in an

envelope marked WTVJ.

The crew member was

told to give it: to a

cab driver at. the Miami airport to deliver

to the television station.

It was addressed to Ralph Renick, the

news director.

The still

film was put in a brown manilla envelope,

folded over;

taped and addressed to "Director, FBI, Washington, D.C."

(Faraldo believes: he put just his name as a return address.) The

National crew member was told to drop the envelope in a mail pouch or box

at the Miami airport.

Faraldo doesn't remember the crew member's

name or the National

flight number.

I spoke with about 20

might possibly have been in a position

to corroborate

Faraldo's

memory of the group being at Key West Airport.

Less than a half dozen were directly suggested by Faraldo. Only

a few remembered such an

incident, none with any clarity or detail.

Clennie Demeritt, for instance,

who worked the ticket counter;

National Airlines

at Key West then, says he does remember something

who has been with the: Federal Aviation Administration

at Key West. for 20 years,

also vaguely remembers reading about

such

a group; but thinks he didn't see them because he was on the

late

shift..then.

Anthony Alonso Sr.,

then the Key West Airport janitor, does recall

the group, corroborated Faraldo's contention that

there were 30 or

40 in the

group,

thinks they were

"foreigners"

and pins the time down as

or "strangers,"

He-is a very old man,

initially answered "Yeah!" to most of my questions and would

not

be considered a reliable witness, probably, because of his age.

Don Pinda,

a photographer for the Key West Citizen, who Faraldo

thinks might have covered the incident, doesn!+ remember it at

all. and says all his negatives from that time were lost in a

hurricane.

A:page-by-page check of the bound volumes at the Citizen's office

produced no record.

The Historian at the Public Library, a Mrs.

Betty Bruce, who was described as "remembering

everything," could

not recall the incident but will doublecheck: the microfilm files

this. week..for me.

John Mangialleto, currently FAA Chief at Key West, told me FAA

records are kept

only 15 days before being destroyed.

He had:

no recollection of the incident

Neither U.s. Customs nor Immigration has any records of any such

outgoing flight as Faraldo describes..:

No one who wörked the control tower in 1963 has any recollection

of such a flight. (Prior to the Cuban missile crisis in October of

1962, Key West Airport had no control tower.

One of the key questionable factors. in Faraldo's contention is that

a Cuban-owned Aerovia @ Airline plane was sent up from Cuba to pick

up the group late at night.

Although we spoke to about a half-dozen

former Key West employees of Aerovia l, none could remember such

an incident.

Aerovia Q,

however, quitits regular flightsfrom

cuba to Key West late in 1961 and records indicate that the last

payment: for office space in the

airport

was made in March, 1962.

Faraldo contends it would still have been possible for

an Aerovia

@plane to fly in from Cuba to Key West in 1963 merely by filing

a flight plan with the FAA. (As noted, flight plan recoros are.

not

retained beyond 15 days.

Henry Till, flight service attendant for

the FAA in Key West since 1961, says it's "very unlikely" that a

Cuban plane landed in Key West

in 1963.

There is another major inconsistency, in Faraldo's contention. He

says he is absolutely sure he

prepared

the manifest for

the flight in question. was Celia

Godinet.

Through her

brother who is still in

Key West, Faraldo

got me her address

in Miami.

She told me she left Aerovias

when it closed

down its flights. in 1961.i

Nevertheless, Faraldo specifically remembered where he had kept

that box of manifests at the airport.

With the

help of the current

manager, we rummaged through

every possible storage area

That took care of my oblique approach.

Because of my interest, Renick said he would

check the files again..

He said he did vaguely recall such a group being in Key west "ei teer

He admitted, however, that contributions. from

our investigation.

A few weeks ago, Faraldo had filed

a claim in court against a fellow

named Michael Gill for an

unpaid 5599 bill for repair to his 401 sailboat, the "Restless

Lady."

Faraldo won the
