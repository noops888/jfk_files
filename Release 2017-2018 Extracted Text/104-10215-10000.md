1.

Pollowing Subject's arrival in Habana on 19 March 1957, he first

contacted AXPHODARCI-3 (on 20 larch) and set up fresh contact arrangements

between AUPHODARCH-3 and cut-out AVANTELOPE to be initiated following

VAIVADA's departure for PBPRIVE.

On 21 March, VAIVADA contacted the mother

of ANPHODAPCH-10 and was inforned that the latter had taken asylum in the

Panaranian Embassy in labana on 15 larch as a result of the attack upon the

Presidential Palace of 13 Karch.

At a personal meeting held in a secure

location with AXPHODARCH-10°s mother on that day,

the latter asked help in

getting AUPHODAPCH-10 into PEPRDE. After consulting with the Station,

VAIVADA told the mother that this mould be impratical as her son would have

to personally appear in the Consulate to obtain a visa; she was advised to

toll AXPHODARCH-10 to go into exile in Panana, and fron there to go to Costa

The help afforded A'IPHODARCH-10 at this neeting was greatly

appreciated, the agent's mother affirming to VAIVADA before their parting

that she felt certain the agent would cooperate with us at any time.

Arrange

ments were made for the Station to contact the mother independently at any

time this appears necessary.

2. In the evening of 21 Varch, after having telephoned to arrange a

visit, VAIVADA met with the sister and niece of A'(PHODAPCH-1. The Station had

determined that VAIVADA should, If possible, broach the problem of payment of

the $1000 authorized at that time, describing it as being back salary due

local standards and that of an insurance policy prendur, was small.

Impossible to take up the subject of the money and therefore did not do 80,

reporting that he believes a payrent ill not now be necessary.

The Station

hasn't noticed any unusual references to the murder of AlPHODARCH-l in the

ship Officer, reopening the case of A'PHODARCH-I and asking whether some.

thing could not be done by the Embassy regarding his murder.

then the

Citizenship Officer, after checking the files, told her that as AVPHODARCH J

tras not a citizen and therefore he could do nothing about the natter, the

niece left the Embassy obviously annoyed and disappointed. No further visits

to the Embassy by AVPHODARCH-l's farily have core to the attention of the

Station, and no contact has been made with that family.

Efforts are being

made, with the assistance of the local ODENVY, to identify the killer or

killers of this agoat, for the record.

3. On 9 April 1957, the cut-out ANTELOPE contacted AMINODARCH 3

and is

now in regular weekly touch mith that agent. In addition to a certain

amount of reporting upon student and university events, A!PHODARCH-3's

principal current task is maintaining contact with AXPHODARCH-6 with a view

to arranging a personal meeting between A'ANTELOPE and A!PHODARCH 6 to enable

the Station to check progress of this operation and strengthen our relation

ship with the latter. Progress in this effort will be reported.
