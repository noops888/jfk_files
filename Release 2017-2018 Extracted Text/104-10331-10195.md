J. Barry Harreison

JFK Project Officer

OIM/HRP

Oswald's "Original A" File and Request for Search for Attachments

OFFICE:

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

HRP has completed its review of Oswald's original A (DCD) file; except for a couple of 1978 HSCA memos, it is duplicated in

the sequestered collection (microfilm). The file is " releasable in full" and will be ready for transfer to NARA by the end of week.

In her review of the file, ARRB staffer Michelle Combs noticed that two attachments to a key document were not in the file:

1) 00-B 3,232,789 and

2) 28 June 1962 memo re contact with the source of the 0OB.

She requested that copies of the documents be added to the file if not already in the sequestered collection. Our search of the original

file, the microfilmed copy in the sequestered collection and the JFK database failed to locate the two documents. If unable to find the

documents, please provide explanation for incorporation into the file. I have provided Eileen a copy of the document which cites

the attachments.
