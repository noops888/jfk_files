ASSIGN WHATEVER EQUIPMENT AND FINANCES ARE NEEDED BASED ON NEEDS

AS THEY ARISE IN THE FUTURE.

IT IS NOTED THAT IN VIEWING ALL OF THE ABOVE, IT MUST BE

RECOGNIZED THAT BETWEEN 197D AND 1976, ANT I-CASTRO TERROR ISTS

COMMITTED 29 TERRORIST ACTS IN IHE NYC METROPOLITAN AREA; HOWEVER,

IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THESE ACTS ARE THE

EXILES WHO RESIDE WITHIN THE NEWARK DIVISION. DESPITE THIS, NYO

HAS DEVELOPED A QUALITY INFORMANT WHO IS FURNISHING INFORMATION

ON A TIMELY BASIS REGARDING THE ACT IVITIES OF KNOWN

ANT I- CASTRO

TERRORIST SUBJECIS GUILLERMO NOVO AND IGNACIO NOVO, BOTH OF WHOM

RESIDE IN THE NEWARK DIVISION. ALSO, INFORMATION IS BEING

DEVELOPED ON A DAILY BASIS PERTAINING TO PAST TERROR IST ACTIVITIES

SUCH AS THE BOMBING OF ORLANDO LETEL IER ON SEPTEMBER 21, 1976.

LASTLY, IT IS NOTED THAT NYCPD HAS CONCURRENI JURISDICTION

IN THESE TERRORIST ACT IVIT IES AND HAS ALLOCATED BOTH MANPOWER

AND INFORMANT COVERAGE IN FULFILL ING ITS RESPONSIBIL II IES.
