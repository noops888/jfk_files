2. The Department of Defense:

A.

Continued surveillance of the area surrounding Cuba at

the same rate and with the same emphasis as existed prior to that

date.

Between 25 April and 23 May 1963 additional sea surveillance

was realized between Cuba and Haiti, due to the stationing of the

Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron at the entrance of the Gulf of

Gonaives occasioned by the deterioration of internal conditions in

Haiti.

B. Continued the installation of military communications

facilities in Latin America. Due to noncommunication difficulties,

the multi-channel radio station scheduled for installation at

Managua, Nicaragua by 1 July 1963 will be completed on or about

27 July 1963. Entry negotiations have been completed with Honduras,

with the Tilitary rádio facilities installation scheduled for com

pletion on or about 10 October 1963.

Negotiations are continuing

in Colombia and Ecuador for the installation of military radio

facilities.

C. Continued the surveillance of Cuba by U. S. forces,

reporting as before, to U. S. commanders, organizations and

agencies.

Reports of subversive movement, obtained by U.S.

surveillance have been made availablo for Immodiate tranamittal

through U.S. military alerting system.

D. Reached agreement with CIA on steps to be taken to prevent

duplication of effort in operating a U.S. military alerting system

and furnished guidance on this matter to USCINCSO and CINCLANT.

After clarification of the role of the U. S. Military Groups by

USCINCSO the military alerting system was again placed in operation

effective 15 June 1963.

E. Maintained U. S. forces, for the most part from within

the Atlantic Command,

available to respond to assist in the final

interception of suspicious craft in territorial waters, upon the

request of the country concerned. Currently, forces are assigned

by the United Commander involved to meet the singular problem

encountered. In somewhat similar circumstances, U.S. forces of

Atlantic Command have responded to this requirement in the cases

of the Venezuelan ship ANZOATEGUI and the Italian ship CANNA REGIA.

F. Had the U. S. Coast Guard Mobile Training Team (MTT) report

for duty in the Canal Zone on 15 May 1963 to perform as a Small

Craft Inspection and Training Team (SCIATT). Members of the SCIATT

accompanied by a representative from the staff of Commander U. S.

Naval Forces, Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO) have completed an in-

country evaluation of 40-foot Coast Guard Utility Boats (CGUBs) in

five Central American countries and a detailed program through

mid-November has been prepared for improving the material readiness

and handling of the CGUBs provided by MAP. Action is underway to

expedite delivery of spare parts required for maintenance of the

boats.

COMUSNAVSO has now initiated a request to establish SCIATT

billets with permanent personnel for an initial period of three

years in order to fully develop the Central American CGUB program.

The success of this program would be a major contribution to the

Caribbean Surveillance System.

U. S. Commander in Chief, Southern

Command (USCINCSO) has recommended approval of COMUSNAVSO's request

to CNO and action is being coordinated with OSD/ISA, JCS and USCG

to obtain approval and appropriate funding for permanent billets.

The 40-foot CGUB permanently assigned to the U. S. Naval

Station, Rodman, Canal Zone, for use by the SCIATT has been

delivered and is

in the process of being activated.

Continued efforts

to improve the internal security

of latin American armies through the provision of Intelligence

Advisors. Presently there are such advisors assigned to 14

Latin countries, emphasizing counterintelligence and counter-

subversion.

H. Continued, through its intelligence agencies, work on

studies concerning

• Castro/Communist subversion directed against

Latin America.

I. Increased to 12 the number of Latin American countries in

which there are intelligence exchange arrangements between U. S.

and local military services.

4.

The V.S. Information Agency:

A.

Issued a detailed infornation policy guidance to all its

Washington media divisions on March 28 setting forth the basic

themes to be followed and types of materials to be developed

in exposing Castro-Communist subversive activities in the

hemisphere.

This was followed on April 3 by a circular

instruction (USIA CA-2819) to all USIS field posts in Latin

America urging each to stimulate local press and radio atten

tion to evidonce of Cuban-based subversion and to report promptly

local developments, official comment, and editorials, for cross-

play to other countries.

B. Broadcast over Voice of America a total of 26 features and

commentaries on the subject of Cuban-based subversion in its

Spanish-language transmissions to Latin America during the three

month period.

This was in addition to regular reporting of

developments on the subject in the Voice's hourly newscasts.

Prominent attention was given to the Managua Ministers Meeting,

the OAS reports of the Special Consultative Committee on Security

and the Lavalle Connittee, the capture in Bolivia and Peru of

Cuban-trained guerrillas,

the discovery of a subversive plot in

Ecuador, and terrorism and counter-measures in Venezuela.

Special

features included editorial round-ups from the Latin American

press on subversion, a dramatization of an incident in Ecuador,

a chronology of subversive acts involving Cuban diplomats, and

history of subversion. In the usual Voice of America practice,

these features and commentaries were sent to USIS field posts in

tape recordings after short-wave broadcast for placement on the

hundreds of local mediun-wave stations in the area.

C.

Transmitiod by tolotype through its press service a total

of 33 articlos on Cuban-basod subvarsion during tho three-

month period to USIS posts throughout Latin America for placement

in the local press. These included news stories, commentaries,

and backgrounders on essontially the same developments which were

treated by the Voice of Anorica.

The Agancy's Information Officers

in each country were provided with copies of the OAS reports for

use in their porsonal contacts with press and radio personnel.

A pamphlot based on the letters from the Guatemalan ex-communist

leader Carlos Manuol Pollecer to Castro and Khrushchev in which

he revealed connunist subversive tactics was developed by the

Agency's publications center in Moxico for reproduction and

distribution throughout the aron. Work was completed also on a

cartoon book, The Despailace, the story of two young Cubans who

tour the communist bice encountering oppression and food shortages

and roturn home to find the same

conditions developing in their

own country.

The ca: toon book is being distributed in over a

million copies throughout latin America.
