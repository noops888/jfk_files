SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, alsa

AR

Reurlet 11/7/61.

Your request for authority to make an installation

at LaRocca's home in Ingomar, Pennsylvania,

appears to be

premature. Informants and other sources should be able to furnish

information as to where LaRocca conducts his racketeering activities

or the 'identity of the person or persons who handle such affairs

for him.

The Bureau cannot at this time authorize tesurs on

matters such as this, however, if a kidnaping should occur or a

life is definitely in danger involving a substantive violation

over which we have jurisdiction, definite consideration would

be given to utilization of a tesur.

If you are able to develop facts indicating LaRocca

uses his home in connection with his racketeering activities, it

would appear from your very detailed survey that consideration

should be given to the use of a nodified SPur.

The modified SPNI application referred to is set

forth under Special Applications, Page 188, Part I, Handbook of

Technical Equipment.

NOTE: Pittsburgh is endeavoring to establish an additional

"isur on LaRocca since he has been alleged to be the "Big Boss"

while Vito Genovese is in jail.
