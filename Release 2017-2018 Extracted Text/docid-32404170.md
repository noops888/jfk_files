MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Director of Central Intelligence

VIA:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Executive Director

John F. Pereira

Acting Director,

Intelligence

Center

for the study of

New

Release of JFK Assassination Records

1. This memorandum is to advise you of a scheduled

release of additional CIA records related to the JFK

assassination.

2..

on 1 September 1994, we plan to release to the

National Archives approximately 71,000 pages of JFK records

that are printed out copies of microfilmed documents.

These

records were microfilmed in 1979-80 and added to the files

that the House Select Committee on Assassinations ordered

sequestered at CIA.

This will bring to 211,000 the total

number of pages released by CIA under the JFK Assassination

Records Collection Act of 1992.

3.

We are also reviewing some 10,000 pages originated

by other agencies, which will

eventually be released

after

coordination. by those agencies.

In addition, we are

reviewing some 20,000 pages originated by Congressional

staff during the investigation of the assassination, which

are to be processed by the National Archives before they can

be made available to the public.

4.

All documents held by CIA that are possibly related

to the assassination are to be provided to the Review Board

that was appointed earlier this year by the President.

This

includes those records that appear to qualify for with-

holding under provisions of the Act relating to privacy,

foreign relations, relevancy, and sources and methods.

The

Review Board will make the final determination as to

possible release of these records.
