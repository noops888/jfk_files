DE 92-228

In discussing former employees of King Coffee who

are now

with the Home Juice Company, Mr. KING stated that

MIKE SIMON, former manager of King Coffee, now with Home Juice,

left the King Coffee Company about seven or eight years ago -

of his own accord.: He said he believed that SIMON is of Syrian

extraction and that while he was with the King Coffee Company

he resigned on a couple of occasions to establish business

ventures which consisted of grocery stores. He said he

apparently did not make good with these businesses and

always returned to King Coffee.

Mr. KING said that a

BILL NEMES, a former salesman for King Coffee who is now

employed by Home Juice, left King Coffee of his own accord

about a year prior to the time MIKE SIMON terminated his

employment at King Coffee.

Mr. KING reiterated that he knows of no person of

responsibility connected with the King Coffee Company who

was addicted to gambling and, therefore, doubted very much

that any of the King Coffee Company officials would become

Involved with hoodlums because of gambling activities.

On July 31, 1964; Constable BRIAN IC ALPINE;

Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Windsor, Ontario,

Canada, contacted SA JAMES L. SHANAHAN regarding one

WILLIAM "RAGS" LLOYD who operates the Lloyd Bag Company

at 114 St. Clair Street, Chatham, Ontario, Canada. Constable

MC ALPINE said that the RCMP was currently conducting an

investigation of LLOYD regarding his business interests

in the Windsor, Ontario, area for possible income tax

violations.

Constable MC ALPINE said that LLOYD was reported

to have been previously connected with the Subject and his

brother, 'BILLY" VITO GIACALONE and was supposed to have been

the "fix" contact with the Ontario Provincial Police when

Subject's brother was operating a gambling establishment

on Walker Road in Windsor, Ontario.

MC ALPINE said that

LLOYD reportedly owns real estate in the Windsor, Ontario,

area valued at $800,000.00 and which includes three

apartment houses: Constable MC ALPINE observed that the

Canadian branch of the Home Juice Company with which Subject

is connected has a branch in Windsor doing business as the

Jay Zee Food Products Limited, 4810 Wyandotte Street,

Windsor, Ontario, Canada, telephone number 945-1156.

Constable MC ALPINE advised that his investigation

had disclosed that in 1955 WILLIAM LLOYD had purchased furniture

in Detroit valued at $3,000.00 and that this furniture was

delivered to a residence at 18105 Hoover Road, Detroit. He

said that the occupant of this residence at that time was

identified as a Mrs. MARION SIMMONS.

MC ALPINE said that he has further developed that

in 1958 WILLIAM LLOYD purchased a house at 18000 Blackmoor

from a LAWRENCE DE MONICO. He said that DE MONICO was

reportedly employed by the Chrysler Corporation and had

left Detroit to go to California. MC ALPINE said that the

sale price of this house was $19,175.00 and as of December,

1963, LLOYD was making payments on the house of $80.25 a

month to the Citizens Finance Company. He said that it had

been determined that the occupant of the residence at 18000

Blackmoor was identified as a MARION SEMENYN, aka. Mary

Semenyn and Marion Simmons.

On August 3, 1964, the records of the Tract Index

Division, Wayne County, Michigan, were reviewed by IC RAY

GILBERT. The records reflected that the property at 18000

Blackmoor, Detroit, was owned by a WILLIAM DONALD LLOYD of

Chatham, Ontario, Canada.

The records reflected that this

property was purchased on a warranty deed May 18, 1959; from

one LAWRENCE C. DE MONICO, wife IRENE, for one dollar and

other valuable considerations.

On August 3, 1964, Mr. WILLIAM RECKNAGEL, Credit

Data Corporation, Detroit, advised IC RAY GILBERT that

MARY SEMENYN, 18000 Blackmoor, Detroit, whose previous

address was

18105 Hoover, has been in file with the Credit

Data Corporation since 1956. He stated that she has/ a

former, address of 30 Wood Street, Chatham, Ontario, Canada,

and there was no derogatory information in the file. He

said the file reflected inquiries July 19, 1956 from

the National Bank of Detroit; October 10, 1958, from the

Gulf Refinery Corporation; and January 23, 1959, from

the Robinson Furniture Company (Eastland):

On August 6, 1964, a spot check of the residence

at 18000 Blackmoor reflected

no activity.

It was noted that

a 1961 Buick, Michigan license AR 5008, was parked in the

garage at the rear of this house. The

Michigan Secretary

of State's Office, Motor Vehicle Division, records reflected

that Michigan license AR 5008 was registered to MARY SEMENYN

of 18000 Blackmoor.
