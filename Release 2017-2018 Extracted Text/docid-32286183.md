husband of MURRAY

HUMPHREYS' present wife.

A lengthy discussion

was held regaraing this situation.

The discussion then

centered upon the regignation of FIO RITO and MARCY and

BRODKIN discussed the effect the publicity has had on the

organization in general and generally decided that things

have never been as bad as they have right at this point.

beat Sheriff RICHARD OGILVIE's crime biils. Of particular

note was the fact that MARCY and BRODKIN were trying to determine

what SANDY SMITH would follow his story up with.

There was

no doubt in their minds that SMITH has much more information

available regarding this situation and plans a series of

articles to continue blasting the First Ward in particular

and the over-all organization in general.

Late in the afternoon TONY GIROLAMI met with MARCY

TISCI.

GIROLAMI tells MARCY that SANDY SMITH, who wrote the story

about FIO RITO for the "Sun Times" got his story from a "Sun Times"

correspondent in Washington.

MARCY at first is skeptical

about his story but later appears to give credence to it.

Atmosphere seems to

clear when GIROLAMI ShOws MARCY a copy of

today's "Daily News" about "the bang"' GIROLAMI's court got

due to bribery of court officials.

MARCY:

Did MIKE call them guys back and tell them

he was gonna resign?

ROEMER?

GIROLAMI :

I don't think so. I don't think so.

MARCY :

What's his opinion of MIKE now?

GIROLAMI :

He's dead.

GIROLAMI again repeats that SANDY SMITH's Washington correspondent

got the story for him.

He again points out that "The Tribune"

not SMITH and the "Sun Times." PAT didn't

know that but accepts it when GIROLANI insists he can check it.

The above is self explanatory as to the developments

as they occurred and gives a clear picture as to how the

situation rests at this moment.

It is felt by the Chicago

Division that they have succeeded beyond expectations in

disrupting the entire political organization of the First Ward

Democratic organization.

It is interesting to note that

strong consideration is

being given to the possibility of

GIROLAMI being made Alderman of the First Ward. Further

information concerning this situation is being

submitted in

a separate airtel this date under the caption

"MURRAY HUMPHREYS,

aka, AR"' which sets forth further information obtained from

CG 6498-PC, which incorporates information received this date

from GIROLAMI concerning a conversation held by GIROLAMI with

FIO RITO in Florida which indicates that FIO RITO is desirous

of meeting with Agents ROEMER and RUTLAND following his return

and discussing the possibilities

of his returning to the post

of First Ward Alderman in a year's time. At this point it

appears that the Chicago Division is in an excellent position

at this time to have either a present informant or an

individual who indicates close cooperation with the Government

should he be elected to the post as the next Alderman of the

First Ward. In further regard to this matter, the following

information is furnished regarding an editorial which appeared

in the 5/8/63 edition of the "Chicago Daily News" regarding

the First Ward developments. The editorial pointed out the

irregularities which had occurred in the running of candidates

for First Ward Alderman and continued that had not the FBI

taken an interest in the matter the irregularities would have

been allowed to stand up and go uncontested. The editorial

the situation and forcing the situation into the open whereby

aired.

It was learned that contact was made with Attorney

General ROBERT KENNEDY by the "Chicago American"s" Washington

correspondent for the purpose of obtaining his comments as

to the FBI participation in the investigation into the

First Ward situation which contact apparently was the

forerunner to an article which appeared in the 5/8/63 edition

of the "Chicago American" to the effect that "Attorney General

ROBERT KENNEDY today praised the increased efforts of the

FBI..... in the all-out battle against organized crime and

corruption of public officials."
