on August 25, 1964:

a confidential source abroad, advised as follows

MARK LANE visited the United Kingdom between April 14,

1964, when he arrived at London Airport from Copenhagen,

and April 16 when he left London Airport for Amsterdam,

Holland. A secret and reliable source of T-l reported

that

he had attended the Eighth Congress of the Interna-

tional Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL) which was'

held in Budapest from March 31 to April 6, 1964. The

Continental press carried a story to the effect that he

explained his views on the Kennedy assassination and asked

the IADL to form an international committee of noted lawyers

to discover the real eircumstances under which the kennedy

assassination occurred.

LANE returned to England on June 9, 1964, arriving

at London Airport from Copenhagen, Denmart. He was ac-

companied by his fiancee, Miss ANNE-LISE

designer, born May 15, 1941 traveling on a Danish pass-

En

port No.

2301698.

Shortly after his arrival he attended

a press conference at the Airport which had been arranged

JAMES DELANEY GARST and at which LANE again expressed

his views on the Kennedy assassination. He also told the

reporters that BERTRAND RUSSELL had written to him to say

that he wished to form an organization in England to be

called the "Who Killed Kennedy Committee?".

He went on

to say that the Committee had now been formed, without a

chairman, but with GARST as secretary. They have received

some publicity in the British press, in particular in the

"Daily Worker" of June 12 and 30, 1964.

According to LANE,

the objects of the Committee were to collect and disseminate

all available information and evidence relating to the as-

sassination of President Kennedy and to insure justice for

the Oswald family.

T-l has no information to show to what

extent the Committee is actively pursuing these objects..
