Lamp Sun Payment to Valuable Cuban

Agent Gustavo VILLOLDO Sampera

Menorandun for Executive Director-Comptroller

Subject:

MENUTUAL/Reallocation of Non-Staff

Retirement Fund dated 29 December 1971

1.

This menorandun contains a recomendation for your approval

in paragraph 5 below.

2.

Mr. Gustavo VILLOLDO Sampera, a 37 year old Cuban national,

is from a prominent and respected Cuban fanily. Educated in the

United States as a young boy, he later studied pre-law at havana

University for two years.

Upon the death of his father in 1959 and

confiscation of the family business, the Villoldo Motor Company, Mr.

VILLOLDO returned to the U.S, as a political exile. He resides

Florida with his wife and seven children who range in age fron 10

3. Since his arrival in the U.S. in 1959 Mr. VILLOLDO has been

a valuable asset of both Station JPNAVE and Station Wl/Miami. He was

Chiet ot the Intelligence Service of Brigade 2506 in Guatenala in

1960 and 1961.

Later he worked as a spotter of Cubans for recruit-

ment, and as principal agent for PM teans which included training

and planning infiltration operations and as infiltration team leader.

By far his most notable and important assignment was foreign techni-

cal adviser to the Bolivian Goverment in mid-1967 working with the

intelligence unit of the Second Ranger Battalion which located and

destroyed Che Guevara's guerrilla band in Bolivia,

As the result

of extensive Bolivian and international photographic press coverage

ot this event, the lite of Nr. VILlould and his tamily has been and

continues to be in considerable jeopardy.

As an example of the

constant fear in which he must live, he leamed in August 1969

that he was the target of an assassination attenpt directed by

the Cuban Government to be carried out by the Cuban U.N. Mission.

Fortunately the Cuban recruited to perfor the assassination was

a forner JMWAVE agent who alerted VILLOLDO and cooperated with

the FBI.

Since his return from Bolivia Mr. VILLOLDO has trained the

Ecuadorean Intolligence. Service for the Agency and has been a pene-

tration into the militant activities of the Cuban exile organiza-

tions in the Miami area, in which capacity he has provided much

valuable information.

The time has come, however, that his ser-

vices in this capacity are no longer required and there is no

place in the Agency for his other special talents.

By mutual

agreenent and understanding, therefore, he has made a concerted

etfort for sone time to pursue all available leads with his exile

friends in an effort to re-establish himself in a sound business.

In this connection he has been given the opportunity to invest in

real estate and the construction of condominium units in the

Miami area with a prominent Miani Cuban builder who is a reliable

friend.

Mr. VILLOLDO needs $30,000 as his share of the initial

capital investment.

Current plans are to carry him on the pay-

roll for a naxinus of six months at which time he should receive

an incone from this venture.

.s. In view of the most unusual circunstances of this case,

and in accordance with the referent menorandun, it is requested

that the sun of $30,000 be made available to Mir. VILLOLDO from the

Special Annuity Fund to aid hin in establishing himself on a

sound business

basis in the Miani area. For cover purposes a

check will be issued to Mr. VILLOLDO fron an ostensible interest-

bearing account in an MMUrUAL holding company in Nassau. The

source can be money from the successful family business which Mr.

VILLOLDO was able to get out of Cuba prior to confiscation of the

business by the Castro Governent.

6. A quit claim will be obtained from Mr. VILLOLDO acknowl-

edging receipt of the $30,000 and including a statement that he

will be off the Agency payroll at the end of the six month period.
