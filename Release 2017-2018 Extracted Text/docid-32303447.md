ACTIVATED UNLESS IT IS BEING MONITORED AND CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE

ACTIVATED WHEN TELEPHONE PERSONNEL ARE WORKING ON THE TARGET INSTRUMENT.

THE SPMT OFFERS ANOTHER POSSIBLE INSTALLATION TECHNIQUE. IT WILL

BE NECESSARY FOR YOU TO FURNISE THE LABORATORY THE INSTRUMENT YOU

PROPOSE TO INSTALL TOGETHER WITH THE TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE CENTRAL

OFFICE SWITCHING USED ON THE SUBSCRIBER'S LINE. THE INSTRUMENT WILL

BE ALTERED AND RETURNED TO YOU ALONG WITE DETAILS FOR INSTALLATION.

IT IS NOT QUITE CLEAR, FROM THE REFERENCED AIRTEL, HOW YOU EXPECT

THE MICROPHONE, LOCATED ON THE BACK WALE OF A RESTAURANT, TO COVER AN

ADJOINING ROOM. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT, UNLESS YOUR SOUND-TRAINED AGENTS

HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT LONG ENOUGH TO DIRECT THE

MICROPIONE TOWARD THE TARGET ROOM, SOUNDS IN THE RESTAURANT WILL OVER-

RIDE THE SOUNDS ORIGINATING IN THE TARGET ROOM.

YOUR SOUND-TRAINED AGENTS SHOULD CONSIDER THESE POINTS IN

EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL COVERAGE IN THIS CASE.

NOTE: Philadelphia Sound-trained Agents have appointment with

telephone company informants at noon Friday, to discuss gaining

access to the target area.

Therefore, this

should be sent by

urgent teletype to give Agents time to review and study Laboratory's

views before the appointment.

Philadelphia proposes to install

a microphone in a pay telephone

located in a luncheonette operated by Frank "Sunffy" Iannarella, a

member of La Causa Nostra.

Angelo Bruno and other racket figures hold

meetings in a back room of IANNARELLA's luncheonette.

If installation

appears possible, Philadelphia will request authorization to install.

FRANK "SNUFFY" IANNARELIA operates a luncheonette

at 742 Christian Street, Philadelphia, Pa.

IANNARELIA iS

known to be a member of

La Causa Nostra.

ANGELO BRUNO iS

known to be his superior in La Causa' Nostra. ANGELO BRUNO'5

chief lieutenant, PHILIP TESTA, is known to

frequent this

luncheonette apparently in connection with the operation of

ANGELO BRUNO's numbers racket.

Since PH 623-C* has lost

part of its'potential as previously explained to the: Bureau,

ANGELO BRUNO and other racket figures hold meetings

at 742

Christian Street, Philadelphia.

742 Christian Street has a public telephone on the

rear wall

of the luncheonette.

Behind this wall is a

small room where BRUNO has recently held a series of meetings.

Through contact with the telephone company at the time the

public telephone was installed at 742 Christian Street, an

extra pair of wires was run and terminate inside of the

telephone instrument.

These wires are presently unconnected.

Philadelphia is considering the technical

feasibility as follows:

Through contacts with the telephone company it

has been ascertained that the company could cause the public

telephone to not return money deposited in the event that

a number called gives a busy

signal.

It is believed that

alter this has worked for a sufficient period of time, then

the subscriber will make an official complaint. The

Philadelphia Division could be informed of this complaint.

When the phone would need servicing, it is believed this

would present a suitable pretext to exchange complete

instruments whereby a misur could be installed utilizing

the extra wires presently terninating in the telephone

instrument.

It is requested

that the Electronics Section advise

the Philadelphia Division if they could alter a pay phone

in such a fashion that it would not be obvious to a telephone

company employee who night later service this phone. For

information, it is to be noted that tfithe above is technically

feasible,

the installation will have to be made under pretext

by sound trained Agent.

Accordingly, complete instructions

as to the method of making the installation would be needed.

The Philadelphia Division believes they can obtain a public

phone for the Bureau to alter in the event the alteration

is possible.

The above is to obtain technical advice from the

Laboratory and in the event it is proven to be feasible

technically, the Philadelphia Division will submit appropriate

request for

the Bureau to make this installation. It should

be noted that ANGELO BRUNO is a member of the Criminal Commission

and has national prominence and this possible source would be

extremely valuable particularly since the loss of the partial

potential of PH 523-c*.

Sound Agents have an appointment for noon Friday

with telephone company contact to pursue the above-described

situation. In the event the Laboratory desires that specific

Ento telephone

information be obtained fron: this telephone company contact,

it is requested that they notify the Philadelphia Division

prior to date of the appointment.
