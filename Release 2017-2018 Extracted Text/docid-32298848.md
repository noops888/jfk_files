WEEKLY SUMMARY

Re Chicago Weekly Summary airtel dated 11/25/60.

PCI |

advised on 11/29/60, that GIANCANA,

accompanied by several other unknown males, were at the

Armory Lounge on that date for a brief period.

GIANCANA

was driving a 1959 Ford Galaxie bearing 1960 Illinois license

2431761. (4)

CG 6379-C adwised on 11/30/60 that he had again been

approached by CHARLES NICOLETTI and WILLIAM DADDANO regarding

the previous proposition by this group for the enformant to

act in some sort of a courier capacity on Monday nights for

them. Informant advised, however, that he has been ordered

by his doctor to become hospitalized during the latter part

of this week for an unknown heart condition which will

probably incapacitate the informant for several weeks so that

the proposed project being undertaken by the informant will

have to be delayed. (")

With regard to the, Ammory Lounge it should be noted

here that the owner of the Armory Lounge, CARMEN FANELLI

has become the subject of /a perjury

resulting from his

testimony in the recent trial of ANTHONYANCCARDO
