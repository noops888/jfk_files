The Station appreciates the information forwarded under reference.

He doust towever that se will have any particular need for Identity,

inaszuch, as the Station already naintains fairly close contact with

all of the Individuals rentioned in his report. He are also aware of

the radio Idea (which has IV orertones), discussed sere vith COS Penama

during the recent Station Chieis conference in Buenos Aires, and hope

to put inbor in contect with Penana assets who may be able to help

in this field. He do not feel that an Individual KUBARK effort is

verranted et this time.
