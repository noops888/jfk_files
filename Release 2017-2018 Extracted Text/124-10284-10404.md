• On October 23, 1959, our representative in Havana

the Bronchor

advised the United States Air Attache reported that the aircraft mk

dropping leaflets on October 21, 1959, were identified by a

26-98

sergeant of his office as a B-25 and

No B-25 is known to

be in cuba and only one is known to be in tlorida. This is the

oroperty of Frank Anthony Sturgis, also known as frank fiorini.

His plane was last based at North

Perry Airport.

Miami.

The C47

reportedly nad yellow stripes painted on its tail. No aircraft so

marked was known to be based in cuba. The planes flew over the

Hilton Hotel, headquarters of the

American Society of Travel

Agents Convention, dropping leaflets. Their purpose allegedly

was to show that the present Cuban Government is incompetent to

maintain law and order.

No bombs were dropped.

There was no

strating from the air, but some cuban planes were damaged by

misdirected Cuban Army and police ground fire.

An informant with whom insufficient contact has been

had to determine his reliability, on October 23, 1959, learned

that the cuban Air Force had instructions to have two fighters

ready to intercept any returning invaders.

With reference to the B-25 mentioned above, our Miami

Office advised on October 23, 1959, that the B-25 flown by

Diaz Lanz, according to Diaz Lanz,

was owned by Sturgis.

sources had no information concerning the C-47. United States

Border Patrol representatives in Miami advised that there were

very few C47's in the Miami area and none were known to have

gone to Havana on October 21, 1959. The Border Patrol suspects

that the C-47 mentioned above is based in Mexico but has no

evidence to substantiate this belief.

On October 24, 1959, a source who is in a position to

furnish reliable information advised that at about 3:15 PoMo.

october 24, 1959, Jose Ramos, Vice Consul acting in charge of

the Cuban Consulate, Miami, stated that the Cuban Government

wanted to file extradition proceedings immediately against a

Cuban exile in Miami.

The informant surmised that the subject

of the extradition proceedings would be Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz.

These data were orally furnished to Mr. Charles Hammond,

Do Ko Harrelson,

Department of the Air Force; and Mr.

•the Central

Intelligence Agency by Mr. Jo Jo O'connor of this Bureau on

October 24, 1959.

It is noted that the press on October 25,

1959, reported

that cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa publicly stated that the Cuban

Government was asking the United states for the provisional arrest

of Diaz Lanz and would request his extradition. In this connection

the above source, on October 25, 1959, advised that Ramos had

consulted an attorney in liami and has brought data alleging two

charges against Diaz lanz. The first charged Diaz Lanz with murder

and the second charged him with attempted murder and were based on.

two cases, allegedly pending in Havana.

The first case allegedly

is pending

in the Fourth District, court of Instructions, Case

Number 4482. The second case is allegedly pending in the Sixth

District,:

Court of Instructions, Case Number 3007. Reportedlys

the Court of Instructions is similar to a magistrate's court where

original complaints are filed.

No dates of details were furnished

by Ramos covering the circumstances surrounding the alleged

offenses.. The attorney reportedly drew up the necessary extra

dition papers including a warrant for the arrest of Diaz Lanz.

However, the attorney is uncertain as to whether he should continue

with this matter since it is obviously a device seeking to return

Diaz Lanz to cuba for political reasons.

On October 24, 1959, the informant mentioned on page

two of the enclosure to the referenced communication and who has

furnished reliable information in the past reported that a leaflet

in the

Spanish language was being distributed in the Cuban colony

in Miami®

The recipients of the leaflet were invited to attend a

meeting at 8 PoM., October 25, 1959, at.

the circulo Cubano (Cuban

Circle, Miami, Florida, a social club, to protest and condemn

the activities which occurred over Havana on October, 21, 1959.

It was indicated in the leaflets that the meeting was being

sponsored by the July 26 Movement (Castro's movement), Miami.

The

informant learned that individuals representing various anti-castro

groups in Miami were planning to attend the meeting, some of whom

indicated they would carry guns, thus giving rise to bloodshed

between the pro and anti-castro factions.

The Miami Police

Department and the Dade County Department of Public Safety have

been notified and these agencies plan to take whatever steps are

necessary to insure that no violence will be carried out.

The informant mentioned in the foregoing paragraph

learned that, because of the furor raised in Cuba during the

past-few days, the air sabotage which had been scheduled to

disseminations were made on October 24, 1959.

On October 23, 1959, Deputy Al Iarabochia, Public Sajety.

Department, Dade County, Miami, advised our Miami Office that Jose

Ramos, Vice Consul, acting in charge, cuban Consulate, Miami,

claimed to have received information from a source

whose reliability

is unknown that a two-engine gray airplane was scheduled to drop

leaflets and probably bombs over Havana on October 24, 1959, and

that possibly Diaz lanz or his plane would be involved..

Lanz, former Inspector General and Pedro!'s assistant in the Cuban

Air Force; Ricardo Lorie Valls, former July 26 Movement under-

ground leader in Miami; Frank Anthony sturgis, also known as

Frank Fiorini, a United States citizen and former underground

member of the July 26 Movement in Miami; and Carlos Echogoyen,

former member of the Cuban Air Force, were interviewed..

Pedro Dias Ians confirmed the data he furnished on

October 22, 1959.

He stated in addition that the leaflet-dropping

flight of October 21, 1959, was a joint enterprise of the above-

named persons under his leadership in behalf of the July 26 Anti-

Communist Movement, but without the specific knowledge of the

movement.

Diaz lanz stated he planned the incident.

An informant who has furnished reliable information in

the past has provided the following data. In september 19599

informart learned

that fernando Coba, a cuban police sergeant in

Havana, had been given $1, 000 by his chief, Efigenio Almejeiras?.

for his part

in enticing Rafael del Pino to Cuba from the United

States.

It is noted that Del Pino, a publicly admitted anti- Castro

leader in Miami, was seized by Cuban authorities on July 25, 1959,

after his plane

had landed near Havana where

was apparently

planning to smuggle someone out of cuba. (du

, The above mentioned informant has also learned that

Almejeiras was attempting to find someone who would lead an armed

100-man expedition to cuba from Miami and then turn the members

of. the expedition over to cuban authorities in much the same fashion

as William Alexander Morgan, American soldier of fortune and Castro

official, had done in August, 1959, when he acted as a double

agent for castro in

exposing a plot.against.castro from bases

in

the Dominican Republic.

According to the informant, Raul Castro,

newly named minister of the cuban armed forces, approved of this

venture and was greatly interested in seeing it carried out.

Reportedly Raul Castro and Almejeiras expressed an interest

in

the possibility of the assassination or kidnapping of Esteban Ventura

Novo, former member of the Cuban National Police, in exile in Miami.

The informant also learned of the interest of Cuban authorities in

having Evelio Alpizar Perez,

Former Cuban Air Force pilot in exile.

In october,

1959,

the informant learned that Almejeiras

and Coba were interestea in enticing members of the anti-castro

faction in Miami to send a bomb-laden plane to cuba for the purpose

of bombing Havana. (X)U)

According to the informant, he conferred with Almejeiras

and Coba on October 23ª 1959..

Almejeiras proposed that source

prominent anti-castro leader in Miamis

or some other leading anti-Castro leader in the United States and

volunteer to undertake a bombing attack against Havana from the

It was indicated that

Cuban authorities would then issue a press release claiming that

a Miami based plane had dropped bombs on Cuba,. offering as proot

one or more of the bombs with United States markings which

supposedly had failed to explode as well as fragments from other

bombs which the cubans would expiode.

Almejeiras told informant

this hoax would enable the castro regime to propagandize against

the

United States State Department in order to force United States

action against anti-castro elements in this country. Almejeiras

said he wanted this ruse to take place on October 26, 1959, and

described the operation as "highly important" to the cuban

Government: The informant witt
