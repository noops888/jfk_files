time that he had been taken advantage of by MARGIOTTI and his

associates.

He also realized that these men were engaging in

questionable activities and felt that if he continued his

association with them it could jeopardize his standing as an

accountant.

with MARGIOTTI and his associates.

He wrote registered letters

to MARGIOTTI, GENOVESE, RIPEPI and others, advising them he

would no longer handle

their accounting.

interests. LAROCOA asked him to continue doing his accounting

work at least until litigation was completed.

indebted to him, so that at present, LARCCA owes him a

considerable amount of money for accounting fees.
