DEPARTEN'T

Mr. Fommerening. Thank

you, hi. Chairman.

I appreciate the chance to appear before you today to

talk about the Department of Juscice Budget as 1t relates

to Intelligence activities and the process by which these

activities are revieved.

My conments, of course, will be based upon my first-hand

HW 55324 DocId:32989716 Page 6

## Page 7

knowledge of the process, a review of the records of my

organization and its predecessor, and such elements of

historical knowledge of the Departinen: as may be within my

knowledge.

Part 28, subpart 0 of the Code of Federal Regulations,

vested In the Assistant Attorney General for Administration

the responsibillty to supervise, direct and serier the prepara-

tion, justification and axecution of she Justice budget.

This responsibility encompasses the setting of general

policies and procedures for the formulation of the overall

budget requests for the Department and for each subordinate

organization for a given fiscai year.

Our budget, like that of most other agencies: has

traditionally reflected a "categorical" approach, organized

by appropriation and organisation, so that

the programs of 3

given organization lave fallen under one or more generalized

budget "activities."

In the past these broad categories have not, by

thenselves, provided much detail on the scope of particular

programs.

Baginning with the FY 1975 budget cycle, however, the

Department took steps to initlate a more thorough form of

budget review when it Initiated its Management-by-Objectives

(MBO) program. Under this program all orgarizations provided

specific objectives for all of sheir progrars for that year.

HN 55324 DocId:32989716 Page 7

---

## Page 8

1229

In the FY 'T6 cycle, the Departnent Integrated

the Management-by-Objectives. program with the traditional

budget process. This step required all organizations to

provide speciflo prugran objectives In support of their FY'76

funding reauest. For the first tima, the Department received

financial data at theprogran level of datail, and all major

organizaclins participated in an in-depsh Internal hearing

process with senior department officials.

The purpose oi those interpal departmental hearings

was to explore significant policy, progran, and resource

issues, Including those matiers relating io the Intelligence

activitles of the Federal. Bureau of Investization.

In carrying out this new progrart, the Federal Bureau of

Investigation made the most extensive submission of data that

had ever been given the department.

While the Departmant's FY 1975 Managenent-by-Objectives/

Budget formulation and internal revier process did provide a

more comprehensive level of Informacion to the Department's

loadership, it as evident that a more surictured, prograrmatio

perspective was regutred to provide greater detail and to

facilitate cross-organizatioral analysis of Department programs.

Consequencis, for Fy :977, the lapartment has developed

and implemented an NBO/Budget Planning System with

• a detailed

program budgel: structure which highliehts orer 350 specitic

programs, including those dealing with intelligence-gathering.

HW

## Page 9

1230

This structure enables, and indeed requires, each organiza-

tion to describe to the Department Its Fy 1977 plans and the

:Level of resources raquired. This system 1s st1ll developmental

In the

sense that this is the first year it has been tries, but

we expect to refine and follow this basic programmatic approach

In future years, at least for incernal review purposes.

In the FY 1977 cycle, the FBI submitted detalled date on

42 separate programs, some of which arelinked directly to its

intelligence and conterintelligence programs. Much of this

material is classified SECRET, out the submission is the most

comprehensive the F3I has ever submitted as part of the

Hepartment's budget raview process.

The Drug Enfacement Adninistration reported. 38 progran

areas for FY TT, of which 6 relased to Intelligence; lt should

be noted that DEA has a budget ectivity for intelligence

activities. The Imnigrationand Naturalization Service

reported 34 program areas far FY 77, of which two were related

to Intelligence. Other organizations reporting programs

ralated to intelligence actiritles in FY '7Y are the Criminal

Division and the office of the Deputy Atcornay General, which

reported one intelligence program area respectirsis.

The internal review process for fy 1gil continued the

touitrit

practice of extensive internal hearings oriented fard policy

and program issues.

In summary, the Department had a basic but linited

1231

capacity to evaluate program and

budget requests prior to

1974. Since then the amount of prôgram information and

analytical expertise avallable to thé Department has Increased

markedly. These changes have improved the Department's ability

to review programs. Although the fornal submission to the

OMB and the Congress does noù refleét a comparabla level of

detail, we balieve that.our new MBo/Badget Planning System, and

any subsequent refinements, will continue to ensure Depastment

awareness of intelligence prograns and facilitate our abillty

to evaluate these programs and supporsing budgot requests.

chairman Pike. Who classifies the budget "secret?"

• Mr. Walsh. In this parulcular response, Mr. Chairnan, I

acted as the Classification Officer, and 1t bears my number,

No:

9:

Chairman Pike. Now, what is there about the budget of

the FBI that requiras it to be secret?

Mr. Walsh. Mr. Chairman, there is nothing about the

total budget that requires li to be secret..

The only classi-

fication -

Chairman rike.

All right, then what as the total budget

of the FBI?

Mr. Walsh.

The sotal budgst of the FBI, Mr. Chairman:

for FY 1975: amouats to $449:546,000..

Chaiiman Pike. Roughly $450 million"

Mr. Walsh. That 1s right, sir.

Charman Pike. Now, of that total anount, can you

tell us how much. is classified "sorres?"

Mr. Walsh. I can'; feil you xactly, in. Chairman. but

Chairman Pike. You neon you can't tell us because you

don't know or you decline to tell, is in open session?

Mr. Walsh. No, s1r. What I mean is, if I may have an

18 not to reveal the

specific resources and manpower committed

to countere

intelligence -

Chairman Pile. I understand that, but all I am asking

you 1s not specifically about resourcus and manpower, I am

asking you for the number of dollars' as to mich you can't

•give us any details. -How much of that #450 million FBI budget

is secret?

Mr. Pomnerening. Mr. Chalrman, In our interpretation

of the budger donation we have received from the fBI and the

classifications that have been appliad so them, the amount

that we.

corsider In one way cr another constrained by

alassification is $82,488,000, which is FY 1975.

Chairman Pike. Of the amount which is not classifled,

now much 1s dedicated to gathering intelligence?

Mr. Pommerening. Nors.

Charman Pike. So ail of the money which is dadicated

to gathering intailigence rails within she secret budget?

Mr. Ponnerenáns.. That is correct.

Chairnan Plea. Is all of the money within the secret

budget dedicated to gathering Intelligence?

Mr. Fonnerening. My interprecation of the budget submission

1s that the answer ls yes.

Chairman Pile, Now, tell is why the amount of noney -

well, I guess it isn't secret any more becase you have now

told us hor much of it is secret, so that 19 no longer a secret.

We have got $84 million worth of"un-line-Itemed"expendi-

tures for the gathering of Intelligence.

Does the GAO audit these expenditures?

Mr. Pommerening. Yes, they do.

Chairman Pike. On a complete line 1tem basis whenever

they want to without any restricties?

Mr. Walsh. May I respond to that, Mr. Chairman?

Chairman Pike. Certainly.

• Mr. Valsh. Bafore I do, I would ask your leave to

clarify one statement. I am nos positive tat the $82

million figure mentioned by fir. Sonmarening includes

Intelligence gathered in the field of orgarised crime.

I would have to checl that to male absolutely certain

but I feel that type of intelligence is not included in the

Ingure that Mr. Pomerering mentioned.

Chaliman Pike. Are you

saying that ke spend for intel-

ligence ageinst organized crime is not secret?

Mr. Walsh. It isn't set in the category of the Kational

Defense or Security category, bus 1t would certainly be harmful

to our effort I would say, Mr. Chairmen, il organised crime

ware aware in specific detail -

Chairman Pike. I don't have any trounle agreeing with

you; 211 I am trying to find out is, is the $82 million figure

nothing to do with organized crine?

Mr. Walsh. Mr. Pommerening has advised me that che

and I stand corrected on that.

Chairman Pike. Mr. McClory.

Mr. McClory. You say that the GAO has reviewed the .

budget of the FBI, of the Department of Justice and the

FBI, and 1f so, where is the GAO report? Is that available

to us? May we have a copy of thai?

Mr. Walsh. If I may explzin, Ma. Congressman;

I have

some exact data hare on the extent of their aucit and it is

as follows:

During the past 15 years the General Accounting Office

has conducted two separate sibe audits relating to an examina-

tion of the Bureau's payroll records.

On January 18, 1964, an awalt of payroll records covering

the pariod June 1, 1961 chrough January 18, 1964, was completed.

On August 3, 1972, GAO complotel an audit of papoll

records covering the period January 13, 1964, through January

8,.1972.

Mr. Neclory.

They have really ever audited the expendi

tures of the FBI, have they?

Mr. Walsh. Nasth. For the record, if I could add one

additional thine, with regard to the sno audited voucher

records, three separate sita

audits hive been nade during the

past 15 years.

HH 55324

In January, 1965,

GAO completed an audit of all voucher

and related records for the FY 1961

through 1964.

In May. 1969 their audit covered the FY 1965 through

1968 period and In April 19T2, GAO audited these records

covering FY 1969 through 197]. That is the extent of thair

audit except for what is going on at the present time.

Mr. Mcclosy. The FBI refused acsess to GAO for auditing

their expenditures. How about the segrat funds, the intelli

gence funds? They haven't been audited by the GAO, have, they?

Raish.

audited furde for intelligersa.

No, Mr. Congreusman, chey have not,, fianically.

Mr. McClory. How many people worked on the FBI bulget?

Mr. Pomnerening. Mr. Chalman, I think that is a question

for me. Mr.Walsh, of course, has an extensive starf assisting

him in the preparation of the budger submissions of the BI.

The staff which is available to me in budget proprition for

the entire department 1s 53 in number.

Mr. Mcclory. How many do the FlI?

Ms. Pommmerening. There are a total of fi i analysts

assigned to the Faderal Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. McClory. How many OMB parsonnel really go intu the

FBI budget?

Mr. Ponnerening. The Office of Managament and Budget,

I understand, has seven people whosa responsibility includes the

entire Depariment of Justice and the entire Department or the

TreaSUry •

They only have one person that I know of with the FBI.

Mr. Walsh. I think it could be to charecterized. Hi

Mi. Kasten. If this ware done prazseas, would it noi: be

a form of foreign intalligence gathering?

Mr. Kasten.

That quote "program to ensure a constant

and prompt exchange of infornation" which you agreed was a

form of intelligence gathering, was extracted fron the budget

justification for the FBI legal attache prossam. That is

page 117 of the Fiscal Year 1977 spring planning call.

My question is, wny isn't the legal attache program

simply called "foreign intelligenze"?

Mr. Walsh. Primarily, Mr. Kasten, because that would

constituce, I would say, a minor portion of theis responsibili-

ties. A great deal of their efforts go into an exchange of

critinal information and searching out of inforation at our

request, regarding fugitires who are abroad and things of

that nature.

Mi. Kasten. You said it would be a minor part of theis

responsibilities. Could you define further that minoi part of

their sesponsibilities, the foreign intelligance part of the

legal attache rasponsibilities, which you said was a minor

part? Exaci:ly what is that?

Mr. Rasten. In the spring planning call of Fiscal Year

197?, I have a question about an infoimant classification of

4,3

$413 million. Why was this listed under Object Class 212,

"Iravel and Transportation of Persons", this year where in

previous years it was listed under a category called Other

Services? Why are you making this change? It makes it hard

to follow if you keep puccing the numbers in dieterent: cate-

gories.

Mix. Walsh. What happened there, Mi. Kasten, it vou will

give me a noment to refer to this, hiscoricully, paynents to

informants were carried in she FBI budget under Object

Classification 21, entitled "Travel and Iransportacion o

Persons"

Beginning with Fiscal. Year 197?, It was decided in

conference wich the Department of Justice that that ould ba

more appropriate, if it were set forth under Object Classifi-

cation Number 25, which is Other Services.

Mr. Kasten. My question was, what are you doing here?

Do you just think it' is nore appropmsace?

Mr. Walsh.

That happens, sir, in the past fiscal gerr,

the Congress restricted traval by statute during the imocie

the real. reason that the FBI spends a

Mr. Aspin.

Let me ask another question: The FBi.

essentlally does three different kinds of things. Is does,

for example, security chacks of the kind where, you know,

somebody needs a security clearance to get a job, or get a

socurity clearance in order to receive clausified information

from government agencies and that lind of thing. It a1e0 does

criminal surveillance and it also does non-crininal surveil-

lance, like the check up on antiar groups and other shings to

keep an eye on shem.

When you have those three things and have them all mixed

together, is thore a way to keep those separate? in other

words, the flles being done on people for security checks,

do they get nised in with other files? Is there any

procedure to make

sure those things are separate!

As 1 under

stand, lt le she same kinds of psopie which are doing the same

checks in many rases.

Mr. Walsh. The files, Mr. Aspin: are maintained in the

files

and

of the Comunications DIvision,

Mr. Aspin. Which files do you now speak of?

Mr. Walsk. All files.

Mr. Aspin. They are kept in whai ofrice

Mr. Aspin. All files on anybody. It you did a security

check on San Jones to get a job, that would de kept sy that

division as well

as if you were doing a check on somebody

because you thought they were the reople who were involved in

a bank robbery,

Mr. Walsh, Maintained according to classification.

Each type -

Mr. Aspin. How do those classifications work and now

are

they kept separate?

Ms. Walsh. They are in chronological order. For

example, Classification 1 deals with the National Academy

and Training Matters as to a1l investigations.

Mr Aspin. When you have a Classification No. 1, 1s

there any reason why somebody can't transfer intoration iron

one category to another? For exampie, a file done or

somebody which is just a sheer securily check kind of file, what

would prevent thai fron being added in another information

picked up sonewhere else?

Vir. Walsh. Nothing, sir.

Mr. Aspin. Nothing would prevent that?

Mr. Valsh.

Nothing.

Fir. Aspin.

So in fact it could happen?

Mr. Walsh.

that In fairness to Mr. Walsh, ve did indicate that the basic

thrust of our questioning today would pertain to budgetary

matters. I realize that a greac deal of the questioning has

run sone distance froa that. When you say, as you have too

often - don't keep using the words "I an ignorant of these

a little bit. There seems to be kind of a new fad that is

very populer with some of our citizens and even a few of our

colleagues in Congress that would seeniagly paint our intelli-

gence cormunisy as "guys with black hats"

The premise seans to be that anything that is secret 1s

bad.

The sensational revclation in the Watergate episode and

a few illegalities discovered within ous police and intelli-

gence agencies have furthered this blacie-hat imaga.

I think it is important for us to keep a proper perepaç-

tive and recogniza a few facts of lifu. Thare are

elements operating within this countzy that pose a definite

threat to our society and to our governmental system. These

elements do not respect humn rignts. They do 20c respect

laws nor civil rights, or any other principles of our demo-

cratic system.

ME. WaL3z.

Whale I would not In any way want to deny

any American citiver his dua process or the procoction oi our

divisive

laws, we must also realize that the fiversive elements will

use these same laus to hide thel acsivicies. the job of

our intelligence conmunity is very alfficul:, yet very vital.

I think that the Congross mat recognius that society,

as a whole, has the right to sxist ind to be procected. We

have a narrow lize to walk in, being sure that our lais

protect both the society and the indiridual.

Mr. Pormerening. Off the cop of my head, Mc. Hares, I

Mr. Hayes, Are you sesponsible for delineating the audits

how they are perceived, and in that pecticular section they

are perceivad, whether or nos they are to be directed to a

special activity or a program?

Mr. Poumerening. I have a generel responsibility. How-

ever, it has been my policy to cloche the intemal audit

staff with a large reasure of auconomy so they can move on

their own notion into areas where, by coason of their working

with the organization, they think there is a problem that

should be reviewed.

Mr. Pomerening. To this point the activity of my staff in

tion

Mt. Ponmerening. There is another audit as part of a

Department-wide review, and that is an audic of what is know

as the confidential funds iù the FBI, which is an anual

appropriation of $70,000 that cen be dispensed --

Mr. Hayes. That is two audits.

Can you tell me whether of not you have been directed by

anyone to radice your internal audit start due to precsures

of inflacion or due to Presidencial dizestivas to save money

Mr. Pennerening. That Is not trie. It has never been

suggested to me. This is the first tine. I have heard that.

wes as perhaps

Joan Baez, or Jane Fonda, or citizens that have not committed

a crime and have not applied for security clearance? I

wonder what is in that other 20 percent and what is the

authority fos pursuing this kind of activisy?

Mt. Walsh.. I can't tell you with specificity, sit, but

every individual that wa have acquired information on in

pursuance of our mission: could very Illely have a file oper.

Mx. Lenman. Aza there any Congressmen in those

particulas files?

Mr. Walcho: I believe chore are files on Congressner,

repoited that number.

Mr. Walsh, Under the "Exeedon of Infosmation Act",

Mr. Lehman, All these files you have, anyone could see

Like to ask it again: what is the legal jussification for

this activity?

on that legal basis do you acquire this

Mc. Walen.

Security clearances are pursuant

Execubive Order. I would like so rention, sir, the vast

majority of those investigations, the preponderant majoricy

of them, are not conquoted by the FaI. They are conducted

• by the civil Sorvice Cormiszion.

Mr. Giaino. The time of the gentleman has empired.

Mx. Walsh, can you cell us how much the FBI aperas

the expenditures for computers?

of information the computers are used for? Are they strictly

for FBI usage or are they tied in, in any way to other govern-

mental services or agencies of any kind?

Mr. Pommerening.

To the best of my knowledge, they are

used solely for FBI purposes, plus the contact union 19

Federal,

maintained with/scate and local law enforcement to ences data

and retrieve data anô make inquiries vich the NCIC system, which

as you know, is composed of sight files including fugitives,

stolen cars, stolen securities, suole? firearms and these sores

of things.

Chairnan Pike. If you can erlarge on that question

for the record, we will appreciate ii as to whether or soc

Mr. Field. Thank you, Mr. Chairna.

I would like to probe this figure that we talk of, the

total budget figure.

This morning you told is, and by tailing us you have

tolê the American peopie, that they are spending $82 million

a year fox intelligence.

That 25 all intelligends costs,

Let me go through a few things.

What about background check? A full field, investi

gation was done on me. That cost a considezable amount of

топэу.

Do you consider that intelligence?

that in the

secret $82 million buäget?

Mr. Halsh. No, it is not. Mo. Field.

Mi. Field. If that is not intalligence, chen the

purpose of that background check is. now over.

Am I to

presume you have destroyed those files?

Mc. Walsh. No, sir.

Mi. Field. Yoi are keeping then?

Mr. Walsh.

Yes, sir.

Mr. Field.

That is information?

Mix. Walsh, Yes, Sir.

Mo. Field, That is insalligence?

Mc. Walsh. No, sir.

M5. Field. Ii is not intelligense.

Mr. Walsh. It depends on you: dufinitis, sir.

kic. Field, why are you reaping it if it is not

intelligence?

Mr. Walsi. We follow die regulations of the Archiris:

of the unired States.

That is an official document -

Mo. Field. Does the Archiviai dofire intolligence

His. Walsh.

No, Sit.

Mr. Field.

I would appreciate it if you would either

Include

the cost of the intalligence you have about me in

your budget or else get riá of it because I think it is sot

fair to treat it as though is is not intelligence, as far

as your budget is concerned, but te kasp it as intelligance

for practical purposes.

Has my backgroud checi given io anyoody else, such as

the Depazinent of Defense, o. the CIA?'

Mx. Halsh. I am noc acquainted ith

details of your

background check, Me. Field,

Mc. Fiela. Could it have

Mi. Maich, It coulá have beer under certoin circuistances.

Mr. Field. So in faot ic ie intelligence. It is

sir. halsh. I sannot agree with that cosinicion.

Ms.. Field. I appreciate thai, for the recoca.

anô is sowês to me like incalligerce.

What about the cost of compucars? the Nacional. Crine

Information Center is Enirly expensive. Is that concidered

a cost. of intelligence?

Mr. Walsh.

No, sir.

Mr. Field. That is nce infomation that is used as

I would appreciate knoring what it is used for if it

is not used for that purpose.

Mx. Walsh. May I ask, sir; if you are going to address

these quastiong to me in writing?

KI. Giaino.

He is addressing then right now. lf you

can respond. If you want additional cime to respond in

Mx. Field.

We have a different sroblem.

Mr. Walsh. A laison assignment but I have concédea

•there can be some intelligence devaloes

Mr. Field. It sounds like that is all they are over

there for and thas is a way of shifting the real cost of

intelligence our of thai budgec.

How about the National Borb Data. Center?

Mix. Walsi. Yes, sic.

Mr. Fiela. Thes is intelligence?

Mr. Walsh. It may be in the dictionary'a definicion,

sit, but ic is nce in ouss.

Mr. Field. Investigations. We never Inally dic find

Mr. Walsi. Not in the sense we are crying to break out

dollars for intelligence in the Justise Department, a lot

closer to that, than he is the $82 million? Wouldn'

that be a fair stacement?

• Met o

Walsh, I can't agrce with that, six.

Me. Field. I yiela back the balance of my time.

Six. Milforâ. Do you consider the locai police

Identification names and the personnel files of this Congress

as being intelligence?

MI. Giaiico. We are sor going to get into an open

colloguy now between members of the comnitise and counsel.

I believe the point counsel makes is shat the $82 million

which the IbI clains as iia buäget for intelligence does

not take into account ocher portions ni their totai buâget

which also are used in the intelligence gathering field and

whei taken in total, total a great deul more tian the $82

million.

In other words, it is within the effoit of sortain

agencies, and I balieve Justice is cao of them, to try to

keep their intelligence budget figue low, as a more

appoaling figure to Congress.

therefore it dosent take

in some of chess other aspscts wich in a scricter definition

and of cousse Mir. Walsh is correct wasn he seys it dopends
