YURI I. NOSENKO

On 1/17/83, source was queried concerning any

knowledge he might have of the NOSENKO matter.

He advised

that "officially" the KGB never discusses defectors and

generally all one would hear would be rumor and gossip.

NOSENKO is considered a

"traitor" in the eyes of the KGE

as far as source is aware.

The source assumed that NOSENKO told western

intelligence everything concerning Second Chief Directorate

(SCD) activities in Moscow and further assumes that, as is

custom, a "special. Commission" of the SCD was convened

following NOSENKO's defection to do a damage assessment.

As an aside, source noted that his defection would be

"examined" by members of the K Directorate of the First

Chief Directorate and by members of the 9th Department of the

§ Directorate](s)

Source has no knowledge concerning any connection

between the NOSENKO defection in 1964 and LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S

assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963.

• Asked™

to give his opinion on the merits of some speculation that

NOSENKO defected under the direction of the KGB to convince

the US that the KGB had nothing to do with OSWALD's actions,

source did not believe that to be the case.

In source's

opinion, NOSENKO's defection and all the information he furnished

about the SCD would have been too great a price to pay.

save one man." (4)

Source does not believe that the KGB would risk

"blowing an illegal" by tasking the illegal to

locate a defector such as NOSENKO in the wesgs Likevise.

source has never heard that the KGB killed or attempted to kill

a defector.

Such actions, if they ever occurred, certainly

ended after OLEG LYALIN'S

defection in England in 1971.(S)

COMMENT:

I ate, the avest legal, in

fact, ordered

Dy the des to attempt to verify NOSENKO's presence at a

Washington, D.C. apartment complex. ATLAST was not, however,

given NOSENKO's name but only a physical description.
