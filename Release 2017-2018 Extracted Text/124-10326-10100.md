As you are aware, James

Angleton of CIA frequently tutns

over to the Bureau on a highly confidential basis

information which

has been developed through operations headed by angleton.

In any

instances the information is given to the Bureau without

clearing

through regular CIA channels.

In almost all instances it is given

to us with the clear understanding that if included in a report or

other communication prepared for dissemination outside the Bureau

the information will be so set forth that it cannot be traced back

he had furnished to "Confidential Informant I-2, an Agency of the

Government which conducts personnel and intelligence investigations."

He pointed out that by describing I-2 as an agency of the Government

which conducts personnel and intelligence investigations the Bureau

come from another Government agency.

in his opinion, recipient agencies could logically conclude that

the information had originated with CIA since such an individual

would be under CIA jurisdiction insofar as investigations abroad

are concerned. Angleton requested that the information merely

be attributed to confidential Informant I-2, who, in this instance,

in could de described as being of known reliability.

It is suggested that it would materially assist in the

handling of information received from Angleton in the future, if

the Liaison Section could work out a procedure whereby Angleton

might be referred to as a Bureau informant. This would permit the

Supervisors receiving the Angleton material firsthand to transmit

it to the field and aduise the field that the information in any

report should be attributed to an informant with a temporary symbol
