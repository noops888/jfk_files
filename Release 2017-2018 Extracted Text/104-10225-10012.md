AMCHALYAS WAS ABLE TO STOP HIM HALF A BLOCK FROM HIS APARIMENT

AND CARRIED ON A SIX MINUTE CONVERSATION. INITIALLY AMWOLF/I

WAS COLD, VISUALLY UPSET BUT LATER BECAME JOVIAL. AT FIRST

INSISTED THAT AMCHALK/5 COME TO THE CONSULATE OR CALL HIM TO

SET UP MEETING. HOWEVER, ANCHALK/S INSISTED THEY TALK THEN

AND AMWOLF/I AGREED. AFTER AMCHALK/S MADE THE PIICH, AMWOLF/1

REACTED BY SAYING "THESE 'JOHNIES' HAVE EVERYTHING AND NOW THEY

REALLY STEPPED ON ME"• AMWOLF/I ENDED INE CONVERSATION BY

AGAIN AKSING AMCHALK/S TO COME TO CONSULATE OR CALL HIM SO THEY

COULD HAVE ANOTHER TALK. AMWOLF/I RETURNED TO THE CAR WHERE HIS

AMWOLF/S WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALK/S BELIEVES WE SHOULD

WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER

TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES A CONTINUED NEGATIVE REACTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED

WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HQS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE

WILL GET SOME REACTION FROM GUTIMID IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT AFTER THE ENCOUNTER, AMWOLF/I WENT TO THE

TO DGI FOR DOUBLE AGENT PURPOSES OR (B) PARTICIPATE IN POS-

SIBLE OPERATIONS FOR RECRUITMENT AND DEFECTION OF DGI PERSONNEL

DEPENDENT UPON HOW MEETINGS GO IN

2. FOLLOWING IS EXPLANATION WHICH AMCHALK-S WILL PROVIDE

DGI OFFICER AS EXCUSE FOR REINITIATION OF CONTACI, I.E. THAT

HE TOTALLY DISILLUSIONED WITH ACTIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT VIS-

A-VIS CUBA, THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AS IS WELL KNOWN IN THE

MIAMI AREA, HAS TERMINATED ALL OF ITS MILITANI ACTION CAPABILITY

AGAINST CUBA, AND THAT HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN DEFINITIVELY TERMI-

NATED. THIS WILL BE MOST PLAUSIBLE TO DGI SINCE THEY UNDOUBI-

EDLY AWARE OF TALK IN EXILE COMMUNITY OF MASS TERMINATIONS.

AMCHALK-S WILL THEN EXPLAIN THAT SINCE IHE U.S. GOVERNMENT

CANNOI BE COUNTED ON FOR ANYTHING HE HAS TAKEN II UPON HIMSELF

We are bolding off ou his termination

bocauso of the potentiolly intoresting operational situstion

AACHALE-5 thinks

the black parketeers roferred to may be on the vorgo of

another trip to Miaul.

It migbt bo interesting fron tho

"piggyback" that channel and send in

an incrininating paciago to a Judo target.

ARCHALE -5

as the source of

tho package la alrezdy vall identified

through the ANCHOST operation as affiliated with ROCk.

there

are the tro possibilities that tho courters thomselves

would open the pacingo, inspoct the contente and turn the

whole package oter

to the dat or that they would deliver

it unopened to the target.

In the latter case the target

packoge rould of course have to be tallored to the targot

but it might purport to be an agent re-supply cache.

Enny posalblo avenues would have to ba explored; for the

Bocent vo could appreciate consideration of the propooal

by the Desk and JIROD staff.

Ono of the first itong to

be rosolved le whother or

not there is an inherent

back" feature of the situation which could causo too muc!

embarrasanent si exposed to prosa play.

Specifically,

is there a case for an allegation that BWOCK was using

the Intermational orgentration with which tho courtore"

aro affillated for "subvorsive" purposos?

Tho onsver to

that question probably lios somewhere in betreon what the

contents of the paciage consists of and to what longtha
