Subsequent to the above interview, RUSSELI BROWN

contacted Senor SANTIAGO SUAREZ, Mexican Consul

at Corpus Christi,

who is a close friend of BROWN,

inasmuch as subject LARIN had indi-

cated her acquaintance with him.

SUAREZ was not notified of the

Bureau's interest in subject LARIN, and advised that he first became

acquainted with her in New York City, having met her at a social

function there.

SUAREZ stated that LILIA LARIN is supposed to be the

widow of Senor LARIN, a famous Mexican candy manufacturer "whose

products are as well known in Mexico as Writley's

chewing gun in

the United States." He advised that if she actually is this indi-

vidual, she is undoubtedly a wealthy woman. SUAREZ stated that with-

in the past week, subject LARIN had contacted him for the purpose of

obtaining a letter to some officials in Paris, France, in order to

arrange the immigration of a Polish family from France into the

United States.

She did not supply any particulars as to the identity

of the immigrants, but stated that she would return at a later date,

which she never did.

Senor SUAREZ stated that no Europeans are presently

allowed to enter Mexico without a Permit from the Secretaria de

Gobernacion, and that subject VON MOHRENSCHILDT would be

unable to

accompany subject LARIN unless he procured such a Permit. He advised

that Senora LARIN had discussed this matter with him and was presently

attempting to obtain a Permit from the Mexican Consul at Laredo, Texas.

The above facts were telephonically reated to Special

Agent KENNETH LOGAN on June 3, 1941, and the information was furnished

to the San Antonio Field Division by teletype, request being made of

that offico to arrange for a search of subject's personal effects and

baggage on entrance into Mexico and upon return.
