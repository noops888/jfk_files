LA COSA NOSTRA

A number of sources have reported leadership changes in three

La Cosa Nostra "families" within recent months. Set forth below are the

background detalls on these changes, Including a complete summary of the

Gallo-Profact feud which played such a prominent part in the realignment

of power in the old Profact "family."

Bonanno Retires

The 'Criminal Intelligence Digest' of January 9, 1984, reported the

fact that La Cosa Nostra "Commission" member Joseph Bonanno had disappeared

on the west coast during the early part of August, 1983, and had possibly fled

the country in order to avoid prosecution for income-tax evasion. On

December 16, a highly confidentlal source of the New York office advised that

Bonanno had called a meeting of his caporegimas (captains) to announce that he

would be leaving for "quite a while' and that his brother-in-law, Francesco

(Frank) LaBruzzo, would run the "family'' in his absence. Assisting LaBruzzo

in this assignment was Bonanno's son, William, a caporegima in charge of the

Tucson, Arizona, area for the 'family," whose headquarters are in New York

City. (1)

By March 3, 1964, however, it was reported that the elder Eonanno

wanted to retire and have LaBruzzo named permanent capo (boss) of the

"family." Approximately three weeks later, Bill Bonanno advised a source of

the New York office that the old man is out of it now' and that LaBruzzo had

LE Druz o cale a

"taken his place." On April 5, 1964, LaBruzzo called a 'formality meeting

of his caporegimas, in connection with which he stated that he had not yet

assumed full control of the "family," pending some unspecified action on the

part of his predecessor. He also took the occasion to announce that William

Bonanno had resigned his post of caporegima in order to accept an appointment
