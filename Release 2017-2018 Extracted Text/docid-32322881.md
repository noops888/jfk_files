to him. He would only say that he received some "help"

from honest American sources, and claimed he could get

backing in a monetary sense from a number of other sources

if he could get the green light from the United States

Government.

Early in the interview, SIERRA tried to gIve

the impression he was in contact with high government

officials, and he had the moral support of the United

States Government. When'pressed for the identities of

the officials he had contacted, he said he had talked to some-

body in the State Department; had received no authorization

from anyone to do anything, but merely had friends

who had friends in the government.

SIERRA went to great

lengths to assure the interviewing agents of his great

honesty, sincerity, patriotism and religious convictions.

SIERRA finally admitted he did make a sizeable

contribution to TONY CUESIA of Comandos L. He claimedithe

money was not given to Comandos L to purchase arms.

On September 23, 1963, MIGUEL DOTRES, an officer

in the orgarization of ALDO VERA SERAFIN, advised VERA'8

anti-CASTRO group has an 83-foot ex-Coast Guard cutter, the

"Soreana". DOTRES said $5,000.00 is needed to replace

the boat's gasoline engines with diesel engines, and it was

planned this boat would be used to transport Cuban exiles

pot cup n

from Miami to Nicaragua for future military action in

Cuba.

group of about twenty individuals, and his group is in

the process of making repairs on the "Soresma".

stated that so far, PAULINO SIERRA's group has donated

about $900.00 for repairs to the boat, and it is expected

a considerably large amount of money will be received from

SIERRA in the future.

J. Wo

VAN GORKOM, President, and WILLIAM B. BROWDER,

General Counsel, Union Tank Car Company, 111 West Jackson,

"Chicago, Illinois, advised on October 1, 1963, PAULINO SIERRA

was employed by that company's Legal Department when he

arrived in Chicago as part of a group of Cuban exiles being

resettled in the Chicago area. He gained confidence of the

company, because of his excellent work in both foreign and

domestic legal assignments, and his apparently sincere desire

to free Cuba from communist domination.

Company officials

encouraged SIERRA in all efforts to unite Cuban exile

groups, by continuing to pay his salary, although not now

engaged in company business, even though the company has no

past or future interest In Cubaiand the company is not acting

for any business or government interests.

In early June of 1963, SIERRA brought FELIPE RIVERO

DIAZ, CARLOS RODRIGUEZ QUESADA, DI. MANUEL LOZANO PINO,

ALBERTO GARRIDO, JUAN MEDINA VEGA and GILBERIO RODRIGUEL,

described as Cuban exile leaders,

to Chicago, showed them

402A R0o0 to me,

through the well-appointed company offices, and introduced

them to company officials.

The company denied it entertained

the group, or assisted with their expenses, but admitted it

has provided SIERRA with a letter of Introduction to the

Government of Colombia.
