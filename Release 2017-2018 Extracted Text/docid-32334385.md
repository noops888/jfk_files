overheard to remark that ROBERT DEPUGH, the National Commander of

the "Minutemen" would not be coming to Bogalusa, Louisiana to speal

at the flan rally to be held on september 6, 1965. FARMER aclaimed

that when the Federal Goverament found out that DEPUGH was supposed

to come to Bogalusa to speak, they had given DEPUGH some kind of

court order to appear in court.

FARMER remarked that Reverend FARRELL GRISWALD from

Montgonery, Alabama would be coming to Bogalusa to speak in place of

DEPUGH. FARMER stated that the Klan would pay all travel expenses

for the main speakers at this rally, who would be Judge JOHN RARRICK,

RICHARD COTTON and FARRELL GRISWALD.
