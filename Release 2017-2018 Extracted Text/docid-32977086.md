THE WHITE HOUSE November 6, 1967

WASHINGTON

4:50 p.m.

MR. PRESIDENT:

Attached is a FBI memorandum relating to alleged

training of Negroes in Cuba for disruptive tactics

in the U.S.

An October 31 ClA communication on this subject

was addressed to Walt Rostow. It reported that

there is a training school near Santiago de Cuba

where from 100 to 150 young men are being trained

in sabotage tactics aimed at bringing about a Negro

revolution in this country. It is reported that Soviet

instructors teach courses in English, as there is no

indication that any of the Negro students were from

the United States. Another CIA source described

the young men as being from North Vietnam, North

Korea, Africa, and Latin-American countries.

I, date no concrete evidence has been developed to

indicate that any such saboteurs have entered this

country since a Cuban sabotage ring in New York

City was discovered and immobilized in 1962. The

FBI currentij is operating 18 Cuban-trained double

agents against the Cubans. None of these have any

information indicating Castro has been success√≠ul to

date in infiltrating Negroes for these purposes.
