Dear David:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 October 1995

to Director of Central Intelligence Deutch advising of the

Assassination Records Review Board's most recent formal

determinations with respect to CIA records.

have reviewed again the 61 documents which the Board

has decided to release now, either fully or with some

portions postponed. Please advise the Board that the Agency

does not plan to appeal to the President for additional

postponements with respect to these documents.

We note that for five of the documents,

further review

will be necessary by the year 2005 to determine if

additional information can be released then. In the

meantime, we are prepared to discuss with the Board and your

staff any issues that may arise regarding the assassination

records.

Sincerely,

Ja Percent

John
