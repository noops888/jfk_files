TERMINATION SECRECY AGREEMENT

1. I acknowledge that by virtue of my duties I have been exposed to or. the recipient

of classified information, which, in itself, or by the implications drawn from it, is highly sen-

of the United States. I am aware that the unauthorized disclosure of classified information

is prohibited by the Espionage Laws (18 U.S.C., Sections 793, 794 and 798) and that a vi-

olation of these laws may subject me to prosecution by the U. S. Government.

title or claim whatsoever to such information. I recognize the full and vested property right

of the United States in such matters.

classified information or material acquired as a result of this association.

to the United States Government for the protection of such information and that the termina-

tion from this relationship with my employer and/or the United States Government does not

relieve me of my obligations under this oath or any other previously executed Secrecy Agree-

ments. I understand that I will not be relieved of these obligations except when specifically

advised in writing by the sponsoring activity of the U. S. Government.
