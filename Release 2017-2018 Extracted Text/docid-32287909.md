Although CG 6443-C advised in 1961 that GIANCANA

and WILLIAM DADANO are "kissing cousins", there is no infor-

mation available indicating a direct blood relationship be-

tween GIANCANA and DADANO, and it is believed thatithis was

the method by which the informant meant to indicate the close

friendship and association which existed between these two

leaders of organized crime in Chicago. (U)
