"Oswald" Letter to US Embassy, Stockhols.

#garding the language in the Subject letter, which isn't standard English, 1t

is ul?ficult to say that 1t reflects any particular foreign (non-inglish) backgrounde

"Outsmug led"..1s Garrande;- and "Sowlat" may be Gormanic. or Slavic,

and both may

tend to be suggestive. However, a Chinese who has studies several European

languages may easily mix the Idions or spellings of any of then in an affort

at Enzlish composition.

"R" is 9000

In the now Chirose Communist national syston, but never in combination with

"Ryo" 1s a Japanese spelling.

In the nana given it is not known whether the Chinese or western presentation

Is used, or, in other words, whether "Ryo" dr "YUan" 19 meanù to be the surnase.

Among Chinese syllables which could be represented by the Japanese "Ryo" are

Ilao, Llang and Lung. Of these Lung (IC: 7893) and Llang (IC: 2733) are used

ag surnanas. In either case, "Ryo" is hardly a nane by which a real erinese

would identlly hinsell.

The unit which keeps record of Chinese Cormnist diplomatic and official

personael abroad will very probanly de able to determina nether thera 18

an actual person in the Chinese Comunist Embassy In Stockholm witn whon the

Dane given in the letter can be connacted. The US Embassy. will have seare

of loaming whether that person was in Stockholm at the tire of the letter

writing, and wethar he has subsequently been removed.

The Fresident

0f the United jutas it America, John A loanedy ras

assassinated by Ict H Oswald by direct order of the government of

the Peoples Republic of China. Ice H

Oswald executed the act alone

but there nas helpers and resorv. "How ill is over" wus password

to his custoners. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but be

must assassinate kennedy. Ve etablised contact with Oswald already

when he nas in somiet but then to try to get hin as a spy for China.

Ister he vas spy for us. When lee E Osrald had returced to USA ve

cunthered nim auer acd iresuened up my mind you have been a suy

for us" and told his what could happen to him if FBI got inforsed.

How we had him. He got his last information in jexico. /It was not

gocd to assassinate Lennedy in dexico/ "Fair Play for cuba" was

staried only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro zor the ag-

ssassinatus. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion wus behind the assassin

ation. Then Cuba was attacied by US. Soniet must help Castro defend

himself. I, that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi

ted. We should be allieted with Soviet then me would ass them for ^

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us, te and Soviet should

win: this. we and whole the worls should be Cormnistic. Then we should

essassinate trustjer and other sowcet leadors and we would be leader

of the NiH 372. Then this letzer wiil reach you they have maked

away with ni and all that knowes the plancs. This letter is outsmugoled

from our Embassy in Stockholm where the imbassy is aighinese spy-sacol. *

My name is ?yo Lang Tian, Officer in the department for State-secret.

If you do not belive this letter explein our hate to USi.
