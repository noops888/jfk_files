WEEKLY

SUMMARY

On 12/31/62, TP 50-C advised that on 12/22/62

FRANK DIECIDUE, JACK PARRINO, and an invididual introduced

as LOU met at the Dream Bar office for over two hours.

It was overheard by FANO TRAFFICANTE telling NICK

SCAGLIONE that this LOU was a close friend of SANTO

TRAFFICANTE and that the purpose of the meeting was to

resolve the question of a $100,000 debt owed LOU CAGGIANO

as a result of a gambling game

at the Congress Inn, Tampa,

some time before.

CI had been told that as a result of the

meeting PARRINO would not pay CAGGIANO the $100,000 but

would repay LOU CAGGIANO a sum between $7,000 and $14,000

as previously won by PARRINO from CAGGIANO.

On 1/2/63, TP 50-C identified a photo of LOUIS

P. BRADY as being identical with the individual he had

mentioned on 12/31/62 as LOU, who had met with FRANK

DIECIDUE and JACK PARRINO.
