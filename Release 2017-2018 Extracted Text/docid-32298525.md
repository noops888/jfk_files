My Headquarters advises that on

the 7th of

July 1976, Ivan Fernandez RODRIGUEZ, provided a list of

43 names along with their photographs.

RODRIGUEZ is

employed by the Ministry of the Interior in Havana, and

is in Canada on a 35 day visa in connection with security

of the Cuban athletes at the Olympics.

The list contains

the names of possible suspects who could mount an attack

against Cuban athletes or facilities in Canada.

A check of our Headquarters indices have

revaaled records on several ot the 43 Individuals mentioned, Lid.

however, 26 names failed to surface.

Could a records check please be conducted

on the attached 26 names for any possible derogatory back-

ground. A similar request is being made to the Q.I.A.
