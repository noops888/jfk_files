Former NO 1378-C requested that a Special

Agent

of this office contact him at Orleans Parish Prison where

the informant is presently confined following conviction

for simple burglary.

It is to be noted that this former

Informant/has furnished both reliable and unreliable informa-

tion in the past. He was contacted on 4/13/67 and advised

that several weeks ago he talked with BUNDY, who is a fellow

prisoneyrand is the same person who testified that he saw

SHAW pass money to someone on the Lakefront.

BUNDY

indicated that he had been offered a deal by District

Attorney JIM GARRISON if he would testify to a story about

SHAW. According to this source, this conversation allegedly

took place several weeks ago in parish prison prior to theâ€¢-

time BUNDY testified. At that time, BUNDY was undecided

what course of action he would pursue, but told the source

and others that he would do anything to get out of his

sentence.

BUNDY indicated in so many words without coming

out and

stating directly that his testimony was not true

and a story was given to him to tell.
