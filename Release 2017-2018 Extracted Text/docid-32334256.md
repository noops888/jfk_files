advised that during the period about

January

through March,

1965, JAKE JACKSON, a resident of Florida.

and GLEN

OWENS,

an Atlanta, Georgia, resident, both friends of

JIMMY JAMES, hung around the

Red Carpet Club, as did STANLEY

WOODALL. JACKSON was a heavy drinker and had nothing to do with

operation of the club, apparently hanging around because of his

association with JIMMY JAMES.

The same was generally true of

GLENN OWENS.

STANLEY WOODALL was employed by HARRY benverT at

the Red Carpet Club, but WOODAIl was drinking usually and did

little work.

In

about March, 1965, exact date not recalled, BudDY

ROLLING told

that he was going to Jefferson Parish,

Louisiana, and that he would be back in a day or so with some

"hot stuff""

and told her to

pray that he did not

get caught.

She assumed ROLLING meant that he was going to bring back some

slot machines from Louisiana, and

she asked him if this

was sO.

ROLLING told her it was something heavier than slot machines.

ROLLING and JAMES thereafter

disappeared fron around the Red

Carpet Club

for a day or so.

While they were gone,

, HARRY • BENNETT

told her on

one morning when. she got off duty

to come in early

She was not aware of any part WOODALL may have played in

obtaining and using the device at the dice table.

stated that to the best of her recollection,

JIMMY JAMES white Cadillac was parked in back of the Red Carpet

Club hooked up to

some kind

of UHaul trailer.

stated she did not stay in the back room and

observe the work there as HARRY BENNETT closed the connecting

doors between this room and the front room, where

worked dusting off concrete dust from the fixtures.

At about

7:00 p.m., the usual time of

opening for the nightly business,

BENNETT opened

the doors; and

observed that the

red carpet had been pulled back over the concrete floor, and the

dice table was in its usual place.

During the course of the

evening, while working in the vicinicy of the dice table, she

could feel small pieces of concrete under the carpet; and she

told BENNETT about this.

On succeeding

days thereafter, she observed that BUDDY

ROLLING worked the dice table, in the course of which he had in

his hand

and pocket a small device which appeared similar to a

small transistor radio.

He always

had this device in his pocket

while customers were at the table.

there.

when the "juice joint" was dug out of the floor at the Red

Carpet Club and moved across the street to DEWEY D'ANGELO'S

place Deano's Lounge.

She stated that this move was accomplished

by JIMMY JAMES, DEWEY D'ANGELO, JACK KRESS, BUDDY ROLLING,

MAURICE ARNOLD,

HARRY BENNETT

ERIC ROSINNETTE, and PAUL BROWN;

and it was done in one night.

I was

never thereafter

employed at Deano's Lounge and

stated she thus

was not aware of

the nature of the operation at Deano's Lounge, although she

assumed that BUDDY ROLLING continued to use the "juice joint"

until it reportedly broke down.

advised that she personally is aware that

JIMMY JAMES is an oldotime acquaintance of JACK KRESS, and from

seeing them together at the Red Carpet Club, she is certain

that JAMES is responsible for obtaining the

"juice joint" from

KRESS and bringing it to Mississippi.

She stated that she never

actually saw the component parts of this "juice joint" until it

was dug out of the floor for transfer from the Red Carpet Club

to Deano's Lounge.

She could not

say positively how it came

to Mississippi, but she believes

JAMES brought it. She recalled

that on one occasion after the "juice joint" was dug up and

seized by authorities from Deano s Lounge, JIMMY JAMES told her

that if any law ever asked her about the

•quice joint,!

" she

should say that JACK JACKSON brought it to Mississippl

JAMES

explained that JACK JACKSON was dead, having been killed in an

automobile accident in Florida.

advised she is

acquainted with IVAN

ORRELS, known to ner

also as

"Lanky"

Orrels, whom she knows as

an associate of JIMMY JAMES.

She stated she knew of no con-

nection ORRELS might have with the "juice joint" at the Red

Carpet Club and Deano's lounge, but she recalled having

ORRELS from time to time at the Red Carpet Club, as well as at

the Gay Paree Lounge at Bilori,

Mississippi.

She specifically

could not recall having seen ORRELS at the Red Carpet Club in

March, 1965, at the time the "juice joint" was being installed

there.

advised that about a month before the

"juice joint" was

installed in the Red Carpet Club, this being

about the latter part of January of early February, 1965, she

was present at the Red Carpet Club when JIMMY JAMES came in

with

JACK KRESS and KRESS' engineer BIll. She observed JAMES

Introduce KRESS and BILL tO HARRY BENNETT and definitely got

the impression that HARRY BENNETT had not met KRESS

prior to

this time.

stated

that after the "juice joint" was

installed and was in use at the Red Carpet Club, on one occasion

KARRY BENNETT told her that the "juice joint" cost him a hell of

a lot of money. ai

Also, shortly after the "juice joint" was

installed,

she was at Gus Stevens' Restaurant, Biloxi,

Mississippi,

having coffee with JIMMY JAMES and CLENN OWENS. JAMES expressed

concern that BUDbY ROLLING was not qualified to run the "juice

joint," and he feared that RottiNg would "ness things up."

stated that she would have no hesitation

whatever

to testifying

completely and truthfully to all infor

mation she has concerning this matter, although she would prefer

that her name not be made know outside the Federal Bureau of

Investigation or U.S. Department of Justice pending her

testimony at the trial.
