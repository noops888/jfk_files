as 134-1A-766.

Informant determined on 7/2/63 that on that date J0E

LANDIN attended the American G. I. Forum meeting.

the forum

members were interested in the newly revived organization, League

of United Latin American Citizens.

They thought it similar to the

forum in its goals and also wondered why it was being revived at

this time - after being dormant for so many years.

LANDIN told

the menbthat he had learned from the Lulac president that locally

Lulac was trying to undermine PASO by infiltrating PASO and setting

up a chsirman of Lulac's choice.

In the meantime, PASO's chairman

had joined Lulac to keep abreast of what they did. LANDIN said he

wished those conditions would not lead to a squabble that would

ronder both organizations powerless.

Forum members, LANDIN learned, did not want to dabble in

politics,

they felt the majority of the people did not either.

They are

leery of the Teamsters and clain racial discrimination 1s

lessening to the point where they receive no complaints from victims.

LANDIN made a motion to give "Among the Valient" the book of

Mexican-Americans in World War II and the Korean Conflict, to the

Dallas Public Library.

An amendment was made to give two books u

instead of one, the other book to a library branch. The motion was

passed. They, the men's forum, will pass out folders on the forum

and may have a mass meeting to

acquire funds to give a scholarship.

An Ennis resident, a young lady, plans to start a forum there late

July.

She will receive help from the Dallas forum. LANDIN and

in

OROZCO will help her place an ad in the Ennis newspaper announcing

the forum's first meeting there. LANDIN will also help in making.
