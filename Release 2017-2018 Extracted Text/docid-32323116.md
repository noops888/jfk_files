enumerated with facts and figures the economic and social and

educational low standards of the Latin American people.

He assured

the group that the latins were alone, the liberals in time of need

as well as labor deserted them.

It was an illusion, he said, to

belleve the Negroes were with them.

GARCIA cited the low percentage

of Negroes that voted for HENRY B. GONZALEZ.

He expressed dis-

appointment in Senator YARBOROUGE,

Vice--President LYNDON JOINSON and

President Kiwielt whon the latins had nelped a great doat. According

tO GARCIA, it seemed all they got fron them was the

"crumbs off the

Therefore he added an independent powerful democratic

PASO organization was needed. GARCIA was urged to bring this message

to the publie, perhaps at the annual September 16th iiesta.

GARCIA
