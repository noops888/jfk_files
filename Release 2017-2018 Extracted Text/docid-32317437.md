ROSSELLI was at his Los Angeles apartment and on 7/24/63

engaged in conversations over the telephone with two unknown

girls.

He left there

about 1:30 p.m, and proceeded to the Beverly Hills office of

the Dunes Hotel where he

remained about five minutes and then

went to the Friars Club

in Beverly Hills.
