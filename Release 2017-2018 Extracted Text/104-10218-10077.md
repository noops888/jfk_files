1.

The following summaries indicate no derogatory

information on Subject.

New York report dated 12/29/59 captioned "June COBB -

Registration Act-Cuba" furnished CIA 1/8/09.

This report

stated that June Cobb translated pamphlets as part of her

job for Fidel Castro with the idea of familiarizing the

American people with Castro's writing.

June Cobb believes

Castro is doing a tremendous job in reconstructing the

economy of Cuba. However, she stated that in her opinion

it is unthinkable that Communism would ever be embraced by

Castro or the people of Cuba.

There seems to be no particular

significance to this report as this information was previously

known by the Agency.

Brennan asked June Cobb to deliver some information to

Juan Orta who stated that Brennan was not needed anymore.

Cobb thought Brennan might have been attempting to obtain

a position with the Cuban Tourist Commission.

no significance attached to the report.
