HO 162-496

INFORMANTS:

On 5/29/68, PCIL

telephoni-

cally contacted SA PAUL W. HAYMES of the Houston Office

and advised that he had information of a non-specific

nature that a GEORGE MC GANN, also known as GEORGE MITCHELL,

a Dallas gambler, and a FRED BARNES had been operating in

Houston in October and November, 1967.

His information

indicated that GEORGE MC GANN had

"beat some people out of

some money" and had left the Houston area.

PCI advised that a "contract was out"

to k1ll

GEORGE MC GANN. He had also heard that the FBI was

possibly seeking the location of MC GANN at the present

PCI advised that he felt that he could possibly

determine the whereabouts of GEORGE MC GANN and if the

Bureau was looking for him, it would be necessary to move

swiftly, inasmuch as he felt that this information, although

non-specific in nature, was rather reliable.

A search of the Houston Office indices reflects

that GEORGE ALBERT MC GANN, white male, born March 15,

1936, Wichita Fallas, Texas, 5'112"

, 190 pounds, brown

brown hair; and FRED F. BARNES, white male, born

April 1, 1927, 6', 175 pounds, brown

hair, gray eyes,

were subjects

in case entitled, "BILLY T. DYER, ET AL; IGA

HOUSTON"

• instant file.

PcI was recontacted on 5/29/68,

and advised that he would

endeavor to obtain more specific

information as to who had "put out the contract"

on GEORGE

MC GANN but advised that it was doubtful that he would obtain

any

specific Information for a while, inasmuch as everyone

was

"very closed mouth" about this contract.

PCI was

requested to endeavor to obtain any gambling information of

an interstate nature for the information of the Houston

Office.

on 6/17/68, the Mobile

the Mobile Office has maintained contact with MOl

contact with ed at te,

Mo C and MO IPC, and none of them has developed any further

information concerning the location of FRED BARNES during

the period 10/10-31/67.
