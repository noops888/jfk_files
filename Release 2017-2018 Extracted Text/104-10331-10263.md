House of Representatives

June 1, 1907

Mr. Chairmad, I am Steven D. Tilley, Chief of the Access and Freedom of luformation Act Staff

of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). I wish to thank you for the

opportunity to testify today on behalf of NARA in suppont of H.R. 1553, which will exend the

authorization of the John F. Kennudy Asassination Racords Review Board for one year to

September 30, IYY8. I am appearing roday in my capinily as NARA"& Chiof of tho Prosidont Joha

F. Kennedy Assassination Records Colloction. In that role I am charged with implementing

NARA's responsibilities under the Act and I serve as NARA'& limison to the Assassination

Records Review Bourd (ARRB). This afternoon I would like to tell you a little bit of my

background oonoerning rocords, of the ascarsinution nf President Kennody, explain the role of

NAtes in implementing the Act, and outline why the National Archives and Records

Administration supports passage of this important piece of legislation."

Mr. Chairman, say career ae an archivist has involved working with some of the most sensitive

and highly classified rocords of our Govemment. I oversaw the closing of the office of the

Watergate Special Prosecution Furu (WSPF) and suporvisod sho tranafor of there rocorde to the i

National Archives in 1977. I workod with the records of the WSPF for more than 11 years.

serving for most ul lust lut as tie sonior archivist for those secords. I elso carvod as the senior

archivist for the rocords of the National Security Council (NSC) following the transfer of the NSC

records of the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations in 1983. In 1989 I joined the staff of the

National Security Council, where I served as Director of Freedom of Information AcPrisacy Act

Activities and later as NSC's Director of Information Disclosure with responsibility for all

disclosure mulivilios of the NSC. In 1993, I roturod to NARA to become the Chief of the JFK

Collection, and 1 have servod in thai capacity ever since. I became the Chief of the Acuess al

FOLA. Stuff in January of this year.

Tinder the IFK Act, NARA had several major responsibilities. Three of these requirements,

lowever, proved to be central to the work of the Assassination Racords Reviaw Board. Our first

responsibility was to formally establish the President John F. Kennody Assissination Rocords

Collection which we accomplished with the publication of an announcement in the Eederal

Register on December 21, 1992. As establishod on that date, the Collection only consistod of

open records already in NARA's custody, primarily the recorde of the Warren Commission.

Socondly, within 45 daye of the starute bring signed, NARA wis required to prepare and make

available standard identification forms for use by all gurelent offices in describing assessination

reoords and to create a database of these forms 10 serve as an electronic finding aid to the st'Ki

Collection. Our third responsibility, which we shared with other government officos, was to

identify, review, and make available to the public all assarination records that could be discloned

under the provigions of tho law within a 300 day review period Descriptions of all records

reviewed were required to be entered into the database wirit they would be mado widely

available to the public.

Al the end of the revice poriod in August 1993, newly released records were made availnhie for

rescarch, including most of Loe Harvey Oswald's 201 Personality file, part of the Central

Intelligonce Agency's "segregated collection" of assassination related documents, and the rocords

of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The database was also available for use by

researchers on that day.

When tho ARR& members were confirmed by the Senate in April, 1994, ury staff and I bogan to

work with the Board and later with the Board's staff, to provide information on the recorde in

the Collection a thai time, the developmani and use of the database, our contacts and discussions

with other agencies involved in searches for assassination related documents, and the existence of

assassination recorde in the custody of private repositories or individuals. The ARRB and NARA

have maintained an excellent working relationip luvugh the J years of the Board's existenon,

and I would like to think that this close relationship has in somc way contributed to the success of

the ARRB.

NARA anthusiastically supports pussage of H.R. 15S3 to extend the ARRB's authorization. Our

mission is not unilke that of the ARRB, IU easure roady access to osdantial do ournoutary

cvidence. In the Board's case the essential evidence is any rocords relating to the assassination of:

President Kennedy. In our case essential evidence consists of all federal and presidential records

that document the rights of American citizens, the actions of federal officials, and the antional

oxparionos. The Review Board needs the sime designated in this bill to complete its important

work in making available as complete m historical rocord as possiblo concorning the

assassination of Presidont Kennody. Wo would like to offer for your consideration some statistics

and facts to demonstrale the success of the board and suppor its one-year extension.

The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection today bears little resemblance to the

Collection that was established in December 1992. As that time, the Collection consisted of

approximataly 450 oubia foct of rooords from a few agencies. Today, the Collection has grown to

raore than 1,600 cubic feet of records or 3.75 million pages from more than 30 diffordut

govemment offices. Those numbers are a testament to the work of the Review Board in

obtaining the cooperation of the entire Federal govemment in this important task.

The ARRB has not only suoceeded in obtaining the cooperation nf the Federal agencies but has

aiso nogotiated the donation of very important rovords til were previously held in private hands.

Donations have included the relatod papers of James Garrison and Edward Wegman, the

prosecutor and defense attorney in the conspiracy trial of Clay Shaw, and the papers of J. Loe

Rankin, the General Counsel and Chief of Staff of the Warren Commission Copies of the papers

of Senator Richard Russell, & member of the Warren Commision, that were donated to the

University of Georgia are being roviewel aud we hope will be made part of the Colloction in the

near future with the agreement of the University. For the information of the Committee, Mr.

Chairman, I have attached to my testimony a copy of the Register of the Collection, which lists

the major groups of Federal records and private papers, along with the supplemental lirting of FBI

filcs.

Not only lus the Cullection increatod dramatically in sizo, the significanco of the recorde in the

Collection cannot be overestimated. In addition to the records of numerous fixecutive branch

agencies and officos, the records of relovant Congressional committees, related court cases, and

records donated by privato entities are available in the Colloction.. This rich documentation is

senrchable electronically, giving researchers the ability to sock out documents concerning a topic,

person, de creal, or even individual documents, not only at NARA's College Park facility, but

from their own personal computer through the imernot Equally importamt, the Collection

provides researchers with a view of how our goverument worked during this period in history, as

the documents reflect not only the operations of government as the offices and agencies reacted to

the death of the President bur also how there óffices and agencies were operating in regard lo

other eventa that are rolated to tho assassination, such as the campaign to dorabilize the

govemment of Cuba or the FBi's mvestigation of various organized crime figures. Perlins lus

unique window on the operations of these agencies may be the most importam rosult of the

development of the Collection.

Furthermore, tha Colloction continuer to grow. Additional FBI records will he added in the

weoks and months ahend. Hecords of the Deparuments of the Army and Navy and the Joint

Chief of Staff are currently under reviow. The addition of these records will only add to the

richness of the Colloction and increase ite value to the genoral research community.

Public demand for those rooords is the ultimate evidence of the the value of the finllection.

Reforence requorts have risen in maber evory year since the Culloiun upcued with new rooorde

30% over this time last year. The number of inquiries on our computer website is also steadily

increasing. Since March, 1996 when the Cullettion was made available through the NARA

website, the assassination records have been accessed over 100,000 timos by the publio. Many of

the written inquirios we reccive include copies of record identification forms taken from the

detabase, showing that the rosearcher has accessed our website and downloaded information. The

armilability of the database via the. Internet remains one of the most important developments that

have come from this process.

Due to the exceptional work of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Reoords Review Board, great

progress has been made on making available as complete a record as possible on the history of the

aesscination of John Kennedy. Without the focus, integrity, and exportice of the ARRB, the

Collection wuuld not bave the sire, quality, or public demand witnessed today. Howaver, there is

still much to do. NARA suppors passage of H.K. 1SS3 so that this important work can bre

completed.
