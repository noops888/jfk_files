Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to William E. Baugh, JI., dated

7/28/95

Re: JFK TASK FORCE

DETAILS: On or about 7/31/95, the FBI will be formally advised

by the ARRB that they are ordering

release of 10 FBI documents

(copies attached) containing five informant symbol numbers and

information, a true name potential criminal informant (PCI)

elieved deceased, and information from the Swiss Federal Police.

These are the first 10 FBI documents reviewed by the

ARRB. They were transferred to the National Archives pursuant to

the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992

(JEKARCA). All relate to the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald,

and/or Jack ruby; and the information at issue was "postponed"

(redacted) from public disclosure to protect FBI informants,

foreign government cooperation and foreign relations.

Traditional justifications, similar to those used in FOIPA

litigation, were submitted to the ARRB to justify these

"postponements".

The information to be ordered released is

summarized as follows, by document number:

1. Dallas (DL) 44-1639-32 - The identity of true name

former (PCI) Carl A. "Pappy" Dolsen, (deceased) addressee, and

137- file number.

2.

HQ 44-24016-329 (DI 44-1639-299) - informant symbol

number for Houston (HO) 1125-C and identity of conversant, as

singular information tending to identify informant.

3. HQ 100-12583-473; and,

1. Cincinnati (CI) 105-2505-45 - Informant symbol

numbers CI 291-S, 104-S, and 300-S; some information (not related

to the assassination) tending to identify the informants and two

pertinent "137 " file numbers.

5. Mexico City (MX) 105-3702-10 - informant symbol

number MEX-118 and corresponding file number 134-325A, both

currently classified; identifying the fact we operated

sources in

Mexico in 1963 which could impact foreign relations.
