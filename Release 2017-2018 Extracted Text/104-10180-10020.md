MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT

Chief, CI/Staff

James Angleton

: Memo received from AMTOUT-I

Attached is a translation of a memo sent to Carlos Marquez

Sterling. Sterling gave a copy of the memo to AMTOUT-1, an

SAS/EDE asset, who passed it on to us.

"The Brigadier of Giron, Sr. Evidio Pereira, who is in

constant communication with Cuba, informs the General Delegate

of the Movimiento Patriotico Cuba Libre, ... news of great

importance.

1. Notify the Pentagon of this fact: Ruby, the assassin

of Oswald was in Havana a year ago. He is a friend and

customer of a citizen named Praskin, owner or manager

of a novelty shop for tourists located between Animas y

Trocadero, Paseo del Prado, in front of the Hotel Sevilla. "

"This information, received in Miami, as noted at the

beginning of this memorandum, were received by Brigadier of

Brigade 2506, Evidio Pereira, who is ready to verify them.

New York, 29 December 1963."

Pereira is probably Evidio B. Pereira Acosta, DPOB 12 March 1927,

Gral, Carrilo, Las Villas, 201-298242, member of Brigade 2506.

There are no SAS traces on Praskin.
