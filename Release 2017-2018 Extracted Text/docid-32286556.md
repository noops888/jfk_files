Re: Havana 92-1

10/20/59

Hav-33 reported that on August 21, 1959, at the Casino

Capri HENRY SAAVEDRA, SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JOHN WILLIAMS (Boston Top

Hoodlum), his brother ANTHONY WILLIAMS, and ANGELO DE CRISTOFARO

were talking about opening the Casino del Rio, which is on the road

to the Havana Airport of Rancho Boyeros. HAV-33 also reported

there was some discussion regarding the possibility of TRAFFICANTE's

opening the Oriental Park Race Track in Marianao; however, the

"Havana Post", and several other public sources, announced on

September 23, 1959, that DAN CHAPPELL, described as a former

President of

the Florida State Breeders Association and one-time

candidate for Florida State Governorship, planned to invest

$1,500,000 in Oriental Park, and newspapers officially announced

on October 7, 1959, that DAN CHAPPELL Signed a 15-year contract

on the previous day for the operation of Oriental Park. There

has been no indication that TRAFFICANTE is in any way connected

with the same, and HAV-33 has been unable to develop any informa-

tion indicating any interest of TRAFFICANTE in the race track.

On September 5, 1959, HAV-33 reported SANTO TRAFFICANTE

was in the casino of the Hotel Comodoro talking with his manager,

BENNY FERNANDEZ, and SAMMY MONDELO.

These two individuals are

described by informant as being from Tampa, Florida, and are

very much in the confidence of subject.

On September 15, 1959, informant reported that at the

casino of the Hotel Capri

TRAFFICANTE was present with HENRY

SAAVEDRA, MARVIN KRAUSE, ANGELO DE CRISTOFARO, and numerous other

gamblers, including JOHN WILLIAMS. Informant

mentioned that one

of the important American gamblers who left Cuba because he was

afraid of deportation was CHARLES WHITE, aka Charles Tourine.

A Cuban friend advised informant he had heard from TOURINE in

Europe, at which time TOURINE was inquiring regarding the gam-

bling

situation in Cuba and the possibilities of returning.

Through October 5, 1959, nothing of any significance

regarding activities or movements

of SANTO TRAFFICANTE was reported,

although his presence in Havana continued to be noted. It has

continued to be uniformly reported by HAV-33 and various other

• sources, and it has been noted by personal observation, that the

gambling business is very poor at this time and almost no American

tourists are observed in the various gambling casinos in Havana.

Sufficient copies of this letter are furnished for the

information of Albany, Miami, and New York.
