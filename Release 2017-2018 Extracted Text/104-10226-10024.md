conflict with the intent of tho LNLOFT action approving

the termination of AUSCROLL.

As you may rocall, it was originally thought that

distribution of econonic data might be

handled by AHHIN,

after termination of ANSCROl, possibly by croation of an

AMHIN economic desic staffed by former AHSCROLL employees.

In any event, noither Headquarters nor LNLOFT anticipated

that the tormination of one orgunization would be followod

by development of another conducting the samo operational

activitios.

On the contrary, our prosentation to LNLOFT

A. OPERATIONAL HIGILIGIITS

During the quartor under review AMSCROLL continued with

its program

to discredit the Cuban regime's cconomic management

(o1 mismanagement) and to sock to discourage Free World trado

with Cuba.

To this end AMSCROLL continued publishing its serious

cconomic studies and comnont of the Cuban oconomic arca.

material is mado avaiinblo to sclected flims engayed in intor-

in the sugar trado.

which is beamed to the Cuban audience and which is incroasingly at

tempting to provide serious comment upon economic developments in

Cuba or those aroas of cconomic activity outside of Cuba which would

have an interost among the Cuban listeners.

ANSCROLL received 15 letters from Cuba which comparcs with 18 re-

coived during the provious quarter. The monthly count was: April

6, May - 5, June • 1.

2. On 30 April AMSCROLL ccased broadcasting over AMTHIGH.

Effective 1 May the program was presented over JMIOPE.

This change

in station (and a consequent change in timo) has perhaps effected

the listenership in Cuba; however,

we expect that any unfavorable

developments will be ovorcome and

that this program will at least

re-gain its previous levol of listoners.

Typical themes included

discussions of Cuba's housing problem, its actual sugar production

measured against Castro's earlier claims of what the production

would be, breakdowns and stoppages at the Cuban refineries, activ

Ities with the Soviet Union and the world sugar market, reporting

the progress of the Venczuelan dock workers boycott of

chose at no one spectate the cute cast criseanse bureau-

A main AMSCROLL cffort continued to be an analysis of the

current sugar crop.

as 13 February ANSCROLL predicted a

6, 101,000 tons.

tons in a release dated 16 June.

These studies received newspaper

attention and ANSCROLI, has received favorable comment from sugar

brokers and other technicians engaged in this business.

MiSCROLL continued with its monthly rolease which lista

the Free World ships that trado with Cuba.

Both aP and AFP con-

tinued to filo this information which results in its being pub

lished in the pross and unod on radio nows broadasts.

Anscrous continued Its malling prograt to Cuba, and

during this quarter mailings approximated 5,000 which is tho samo

level as the previous quartor.

B. ADNINISTRATION

The amount budgetod for tho quarter under reviow was

$33,500.00 of which $13, 032.45 was spit to the savines caused

This significant do

cline in expenses was in large part duo

py the cancellation of tho AMTHIGIl radio prograz and by continuod

attention to economies of oporation within ANSCAULL Itself.

C. PROBLEMS

The Station is not aware of any specific problems having

to do with the ANSCROLL organtiation.

Mention might be mado in

passing of the over presont norale problom (which is by no monna

limited to AMSCROLL) engondored by incrensing economies and ro

strictions in operations.

In view of this dependenco, who can dony that the relation betweon Cuba and Russla 1e

UNIDAD MONTHLY, ISSUE, NO. 37, May, 1967

This issue has been almost entiroly devoted to a reprint of I. Andrés Collazo's sta

tement concerning his experience as a CUFLET representative in london. we have

printed most of the contents of the statement in the fom of a signed amticle sutl

tIed "INSIDE CUTIET".

As 1s known, Collazo tolls of the "dog fights" that have risen between the privateers

(such as FRANGISTAS) and CUFIET over violations of contracts, bad condition of the

ships, ote.

He also discusses the decline in free world shipping to Cuba and 1tg causes, as well

as the nature and background of the shippers that participate In the Cuban trade.

Besides the above, the following 15 Inciuded In this Issue:

PAGE 110

EDITORIAL: "A OOMUNIST TRUTH": Volsky, the Chiel of the Soviet observing delezation

to the CEPAI meeting in Caracas, said that "Cuba is the minor daughter of the ISSA,

and ninor daughters are papered". The fussian's insolence has roused the anger of

all voll-born Cubans. Jet, there's a lot of truth in sat the fussian said.

Indeed, minor daughters depend on theds parents, get everything they need from that.

and are subject to their supreme authority. Il the daughter works, she must also turn

a gocd part of the fruits of her toil uver to her parents.

This is what happens with Cuba and the USSR. The Soviets and their satellites sell

Cuba 78.6% of her imports, dictate the policy of the Havana régina, and take 80% of

her experts.

In view of this deperdence, who can deny that the relation between Caba and Bissia 1a

that of a door daughter with respect to her parentst

The fussian oniy lied when he spoke of lipampering". Cuba 1s not paupoled by Mother

Russia; she 1s oppressed, exploited and corrupted by her.

On 27 March 1967, a letter

from Cuba was received at

the postal address given

by the radio program of AMSCROLL.

The letter had been mailed in Habana on 4 March 1967 and the

contents included three photos of an unidentified individual

and one photo each of individuals identified as Reynaldo

*IRSULA Brea and Antonio FERNANDEZ Fernandez.

A note which

was included stated that henceforth the sendor would identify.

himself as *'Parcrasio".

He indicated that if it was desired

receipt of his letter could be mentioned on the AMSCROLL

radio program but that never should any mention of the

contents be mentioned as

this could reveal his identity to

the DSE.

Pancrasio stated his help would not be much but

that his letters might contain information which could be

of value.

He wrote that he could not go into detail as

he was unable to spend much time at the typewriter..

Pancrasio concluded by saying the photos of Antonio and

Reynaldo were in the hands of a security agent who had

orders to find them.

They had both been fugitives for a

long time.

The other photo (in triplicate) was

of a

Canadian

citizen whose passport was

mailed from Habana on 13 March and was directed to Cillermo

ALFONSO,

649 William Street, Key West.

Typed on ohe of the

two sheets of paper forwarded by Pancrasio was a note saying

this was lotter rumber for fo. percorin and requesting

Guillermo ALFONSO to forward the papers to the same postal

address which he had previously utilized.

Copies of the

contents of this letter are attached under separate cover.

The one paper,

dated 27 September 1961,

appears to be a

list of Costa

Ricans who visited Cuba under the auspices of

ICAP.

The second paper appears to be a list of Brazilians

who visited Cuba, probably in mid 1960 when Janio QUADROS made

a visit to (uba as part of his presidential campaign in

Brazil.

4.

On 2 May 1967, a JMWAVE Officer visited Guillermo

ALFONSO in an effort to identify Pancrasio and develop

sufficient information to evaluate his information and

deterrine the extent of his

access.

ALFONSO claimed he

had no idea as to the identity'of Pancrasio and was unable

to suggest possible candidates from his relatives in Cuba,

former work associates, classmates or neighbors.

ALFONSO

had retained the envelop from Cuba which contained Pancrasio's

second message and a short message to ALFONSO.

The note to

ALFONSO stated that Pancrasio had received ALFONSO's name

and address from some unidentified Individual and that it was

requested

that ALFONSO forward the contents of the letter to

the

AYSCROLL address which was enclosed.

ALFONSO was

cautioned not to mention anything concerning the matter to

anyone, especially to relatives in Cuba.

Pancrasio stated

this was his second letter (not fourth as indicated on the

material which was forwarded on by ALFONSO) and that the

..first had been sent direct to the AMSCROLL address.

It was

stated this was the first letter by which ALFONSO would

serve as intermediary and

that other letters would come

at infrequent intervals.

Pancrasio had decided to use an

Intermediary address as

the AMSCROLL address was too well

known.

Pancrasio concluded his note by saying that he

preferred

to remain anonymous and that he would be remaining

in Cuba for two

In addition to the above cited

message, the letter to ALFONSO contained a calling card with

the name Dr Luc B. INVOCENT, President of the Haitian

Revolutionary Movement.

On the back of the card was typed in

Spanish "without comment".

ALFONSO was instructed to forward any mail received

from Pancrasio in an expeditious manner and JMWAVE Will

follow any leads obtained which might help to identify

Pancrasio in order to develop him into a more productive

source of information.

"UNIDAD" NONTHLY, ISSUE NO. 36, APRIL, 1967.-

(1) ANOTHER REGIME OFTICIAL LELECTS IN GIEAT BRITAR: A brief story on the Colla

so defection, followed by excerpte from his original statement. Excerpts include:

reasons why free world sea trade with Cuba is declining (U.S. Black List, Letin

workers' boycott, etio); Cube-trading shipouners take advantage of Castro and over

charge him for charters; the personnel problem in "Yambisas"; the planned deception

for Expo 67 (exhibiting console record players rade up of foreign components and

wood as Cuban made; general corclusion: régine officiale don't know where they are

haaded for.

(2) EDITORIAL: HATED BY FRIMID AND FOES The Russians hate Castro because he has

two timed them in the Sino Sovict lit; the chisese loathe him bacause they regard

him as & mercenary who has sold out to the Soviets, Latin American Rods hate him

as well, because, as they, say, he has promoted fractionalien in their ranks. Anti-

Commists throughout the Anericas hate him too, as there is not a country in the

hemisphere where mothers and wives are not mourning the loss of a dear one to Cas

troite terrorists.

And anti-Red Cubans would not touch Cestro with a ten-foot pole.

Hated by friend and foe alike, how could anyone think that Castro may eventually

survive a chronic ed nonde crisis that his own ineptitute has wrought on the nation?

PAGE TWO:

(1). MOROCCO BREAKS DEPENDENCE QI CUBAN SUGAR: Fron the EIR we take the story on the

Moroccan plan to develop their. on sugar industry at the expense of purchases from

•Cuba. This plan, we stress, is receiving folish financial and technical ald, which

shows to what extent Castro's Red cotrades are concerned with his sugar interests.

(2) DO THE SOVIETS SEND "PEJECTS PARDE TO CUBA?: Also from the EIR, this is the .

story on the "coincidence" that poor-quallty or defective parts began to arive in

Cuba, under Soviet Cuban barter agreements, right after the price of sugar droppede

he be? = what could have haypenod to Raulito? - maybe he's got the "ghakes

or was abducted by (eloped with) a Congolese? (Thie is a reference to the old

Cuban Joke about Raul being a honosexual and having a preference for husiy Congo

20s0).

(4) Boxs CUBAN! Help the fight against the tyrary. Pass this leste on to

your friends an trusted acquaintances. Report to un any news that night be in

PACE THREE:

(1) Continuation of front-page story on Collazo.

(2) CASTRO TO BE ACCUSED BY REDS: a brief story on the announced plans of the

Venezuelan Comunists to charge Castro with midling and prototing fractionalls,

at a forthcoming Cornist meeting in Prague.

Belations Between Cuba and the Soviet Union:

How Much lepen-

dency? Boti

land Headquarters are being provided with

an original and one copy of the study in English and an original

-.--and one copy in Spanish®

Two sots of the one table and the six

charts that support the study are also being forarded each

addressee.

This is an AlSCROIL prepared study; the author is

ArRant in collaboration with AlSikE-1. It

was prepared in

resposse to references A and B.

We have limited this study to an attempt to provo

statistically the very rapid rise of Cuban economic dependency

upon the Soviet Union.

We have intentionally avoided editorial

Izing as the facts speak for themselves; thus we have drawn no

political conclusions, nor have we attempted to establish that

this econonic dependency carries with it an implicit policy

control on the part of the Soviets (partly because policy control

does not necessarily follow and, in any event, the reader is free

to draw his own conclusions).

If it does not run counter to Station

plans,

we suggest that ANSCROLL - a JINAVE

-rproduce this study

under its name for private distribution to its list of sugar bro-

ECONCHIC RELATIONS BETBEEN

CUBA AND THE SOVIET UNION: HOW MUCH DEPENDENCY?

'ser

-1.

meni son dad tristanica

Cuba's dependency on

the Soviet Union is known. The question iss how much de

pendency? In order to arrive

at some conclusion we have chosen Cuba"s foreign trade

statistics for the 1959-1966 period.

We will work under the following economic assumption: Economic dependency of one

country on the other can be indicated to a considerable extent by their trade as this

• Indicates the need one country has of the other as a market for its exports and as

a supplier for its imports.

What we will do is to analyze the Cuban Trade Balance for the 1959-1966 period. *

1) According to the assumption we established regarding trade dependency, we can

say that during 1959 Cuba

was

dependent upon the Free Horld for its markets as total

" trade value for that year amounted to $ 1, 305, 700,000 and trade value with the Free

World represented $ 1,289,000, 000 (or 98.8% of the total trade).

Broken down into exports and imports we see that in 1959 Cubar exports totaled

$ 637,700,000 while total imports were $ 688,000,000. Thus, the trade balance showed

a $ 26,500,000 deficit, which was a reflection of the trend started in 1958 due to

* Every figure in this paper will be given in U.S. dollars únless otherwise

Indicated. The sources for the figures used throughout the analysis, the

•table, and charts were: "The Economist", "The New York Times", UN's Econo

mic Reports on Latin America, "Cuba Comercio Exterior" magazine, "Visión"

magazine, "IS News & World Report", and The Economist Intelligence Unit"s

"Quarterly Economie Review"

It should be remembered that the figures refer only to the Cuban Trade Ba

..."lances lola, imports and exports, and not to the Cuban Balance of Payments

which would reflect loans and financial arrangements, plus the Soviet mili-

tary and techical assistance, figures which do not appear in the balance of

trade and which are not available to us with sufficient authenticity to war

rant their use.

the unstable political situation under the Batista regine and the ecunomic insecurity

of the new Castro regime.

Of the above mentioned exports, 97.8% were to Free World countries and only 2.28

if is to toch

to Communist countries, Impost-wise, 99.96 were wade from Free Morid countries, while

Ool% were made from Communist countries.

Thus, we can conclude that Cuba was still very much dependent upon the Free World

as rade wind rautina 1959, Further, at loast $ 623, 800,000 (97,8% of total exports)

was collected in hard currency.

2) In 1960, Anastas Mikoyan visited Cuba and the Cuban Soviet trade agreement was

signed. The effect of this agreement is immediately apparent when viewed through Cu

ba"s foreign trade figures®

Total trade value decreased in 1960 to S 1,168, 000,000 from $ 1, 305, 700, 000. Free

World participation decreased more than proportionately, do the value of Cuban trade

with the Free World was $ 897,000,000, while trade with Communist countries increased

(od 2% 271,000,000 for 23,386 of total tradel versus $ 1,289, 900, and and $ 15,920,000

respectively in 1959

.The trade balance was

in favor of Cuba in the anount of $ 68,000,000 as control..

of imports, especially from the Free World, established in 1959 was having its effect.

3) In 1961 the whole foreign trade picture was transformed. It was almost the

reverse of 1960. Total trade amounted to $ 1,253,600, 000, of which Free World parti-

cipation represented $ 348,600,000 (or 27.84) and Communist trade $ 905,000,000 (or

72.276)

No can look at this another way. In 1960, Cuban exports earned $ 467,000,000 in

hard currenty. In 1961, the hard currency earnings amounted to $ 166,800,000 since the

$ 458,100,000 value of Cuban exports to the Communist countutes represented "agreement

valve" or "nomihal hard currency value" as the trade was conducted under barter agrees

ments, with the Soviet Union providing about 10% to 20% ofthe total Cuban export value

in convertible currency.

Cuba was now dependent, economically, upon the Communist World, especially the

Soviet Union.

The fact that little hard currency was obtained from its new trade part

mers further commited Cuba's econony to the Communist Bloc.)

4) In 1962, the trend continued. Total trade was $ 1,257, 000, 0000 of which

$ 1,031,000,000 (82.18) was with the Communist Bloe and only $ 226,000,000 (17.996)

with Free World countries.

Another phenomenon appeared during 1962. The Savlets, who had been carefui

not

to press Cuba during 1960 with regards to their trade balance (which was favorable to

Cuba by $ 31,000, 000) were shrewd enough to close the gap during 1961. The balance

was favorable to Cuba by $ 11, 200,000. 3

Clearly, the Soviet pressure was on. In 1962, Cuba faced a $ 227,000,000 defleit

with the Cormunist countries. Compounding this is the fact that by 1962 Cuba had spent

30.6% of its hard currency

reserves in Free World markets®

Dependency upon the Soviet Union arrived to stay as trade with the Communist World

represented 82.1% of total trade and imports from the Conmunist area bad for the first

time, surp as sed Cuban exports to the Bloc.

3) Two interesting developments occured in 1963.. First of all, total trade ilth

the Communist countries maintained the 1962 level ($ 1,031,000,000 In 1962 and

$ 1,054, 900, 000 1n 1963). But, the Soviet Union tightened the grip by increasing its

exports :to Cuba to $ 687, 900,000 (In 1962 they represented $ 629,000, 000), while Cuban

exports to

the Communist Bloe decreased to $ 366, 000, 000 (in 1962 they represented

$ 402,000,000) Thus, the imbalance for Cuba Increased to $ 322,900,000 (in 1962 1t

was $ 227,000,000)

necrop use

At the same time, Cuba attempted an approach to the free world markets by taking

advantage of an increase in the price of sugar in the world market (sugar averaged

8.48 cts: per pound during this period). Cuba"s total trade with the Free World in -

ereased to $ 354, 300,000 (1n 1962 it had been $ 226, 000, 000).

Cilanen

Nevertheless, the 1963/trade balance worsened for Cuba as it showed a $ 323, 200,000

deficit. -The Free Horld ecuntries were able to turn the tables on Cuba (as in 1962

they had a $ 12,000,000 deficit on the trade balance with Cuba and now Cuba mas

$ 300,000 stoista

defect with the Free would,

6) For 1964, a favorable world sugar market (average price of 5.86 cts. per pound)

encouraged

•Cuba to continue its flirtation with the Free Morld. The Cuban treasury

was able to handle some hard currency for the first time in the Castro era and Cuban

cormercial missions were sent to Europe and Japan to purchase items no longer availabl

in Cuba.

Total trade increased to $ 1,722,000, 000 and the Free World participation Increased

From $ 354, 300,000 (23.28) in 1963 to $ 612,000,000 (35.6%). The Free World spending

spree took its toll as the trade balance with the Free World

showed a $ 30,000,000 dem

ficit for Cuba. And here, we are speaking of a hard currency loss.

Not even in the midst of Cuba"s affair with the Free World did the Soviet Union

Lose control of the situation. On January 20, 1964, Cuba was signing a trade agreea

ment with the Soviet Union by which it was cormiting about half of

its planned

future

• sugar production to the Soviet Union for the next six years. The amounts Cuba agreed

to deliver to the Soviet Union were: 2,100,000 metric tons in 1965, 3,000, 000 in 19663

4,000,000 1л 19678 4,000,000 1л 1968, 5,000,000 in 19693 and 5,000, 000 in 1970. The

Soviet Union did agree to fix the price of Cuba"s sugar at 6 cts. per pound, which

perhaps seems generous in 1967, but hardly a good offer on January 20, 1964, as the

price of sugar on January 19, 1964 was 9,50 cts. per pound. Adding insult to injury

the Soviet Union did not include in the 1964 trade agreement its previous comitment

to provide Cuba with 10% or 20% of the payments in hard currency as it had done in the

1960 agreemente

7) By 1965 Cuba was sending few trade missions

abroad, wirtually.-ceased its hard

securind

-currency purchases, and found itself with almost no hard currency (the average price

of sugar had dropped to 2.12 ets. per pound), During 1955 Cuba faced the Soviet Union

more empty handed

than before and

the general trade situation returned to 1963 levelg

except that by now the Communist

countries had more participation and the Free World

had less.

Total trade amounted to $ 1,551,000,000 (compared to $ 1,410,200, 000 1n

1963), but trade with Cormunist countries reached $ 1,195,000, 000 (compared to

$ 1,054,900,000 1n 1963) Trade with the Free Horld remained at the same level

- $ 354, 300,000 in 1963 and $ 356, 000,100 in 1965, but sith a difference - the Cum

ban defielt in its trade balance with the Free World rose from $ 300, 000 in 1963 to

$ 60,000,000 1n 1965.

So, the Soviets continued in control as trade vith the Communist countries rem

presented more than three quarters of Cuba's total trade for that year. The sugar

production had already been mortgaged, the sugar market was depressed, and Cuba was

more and more dependent upen the Soviet Union.

8) Then came 1966, Sugar prices decreased to an average of 1.86 ets. per pound,

Total trade decreased to $ 1,465,000,100 as compared with $ 1,551,000, 000 in 1965.

.. Trade with Coumunist countries also decreased (from $ 1,195, 000,000 in 1965 to

$ 1,160,000,000 in 1966) and the Soviets were able to rush a little further and in

creased Cuba's deficit in the trade balance from $ 119,000,000 in 1965 to $ 200,000, 000

In 1966.

Free Morid countries also gained. Total Free Vorld trade decreased to $ 305,000, 000

(from $ 356,000, 000 in 1965), but the Cuban deficit increased from $ 60,000,000 in

1965 to $ 65,000,000 in 1966.

Our conclusions follow:

_FIRST: Cuba is economically dependent upon the Soviet Union.

SECOND : This dependency is increasing. It has risen from 1.2% in 1959 to 79.28

by 1966.

To buttress this conclusion we boint out that:

• A) Cuba has mortgaged Its sugar production to the Soviet Union.

B) Cuba has exhausted 14g hard currency reserves.. While an exact

1s.

not avallable we estimated it to be about $ 20,000, 000, in December 1964.

C) Cuba does not receive hard currency from its trade with the Communet

countries under the present barter agreements.

D) Cuba has a $ 1,132, 000,000 trade defieit with the Communist countries

for the 1963 - 1966 period.

Nor does

this figure include Communist technical assis

tance, military equiment, scholarships, and the like.

THIRD: Cuba has lost Its position at a meaningful trader in the Free World, which

in turn has increased its dependency upon the Soviet, Union.

1. During the quarter under review ANSCROLL continued Ite

campaign to discredit the Cuban regime's economic magement.

As before, the campaign was conducted by the AUSCrOil, radio

program and by serious econoule studies and comment thet were

provided its mailing list of sugar brokors, selected firm

engage: In Intornational trade and shipping, and commorcial and

tochnical Journale.

The Station continues to be encouragod by

ovidence of increased acceptance of the AUSCROl!, efforts.

For

example, AlSChOLi received eighteen letters from Cuba during this

quarter, all of which were in direct response to the radlo program.

Of these, twelve were received in larch which repiesents the

In January, the Vice President of the Association

of Sugar Producers of Puerto Rico called upon the AUSCRO:Y

offices to request ANSCROLL's assistance in preparing a chapter

on Cuban sugar production problems to be included in a book this

AMSCROLL received requests fron four univeral-

wire services, particularly Associated Prese

and Agence France

Presse, continued to file stories based upon AMSCROLL releases.

3. The AlSCROLL radio program continued as reported for the

last

quarter-daily except Sunday for ten minutes over ANTHIGY..

In addition, on 1 January AMSCROLL began a thirteen minute

program each Sunday on AuTHIGH.

These programs are in large part

confined to subjects of an economic nature with the time on

Sunday devoted to an in-depth analysis of what has occurred in

this area since the previous Sunday.

Typical themes bit through

out this quarter vere: Economie and sociological aspects of

Castro's "San Andres"

speech of 28 Innuary, an unfavorable

balance of trade with Spain of $30,000,000, signifIcance of Sovlet

trade with Chile as compared with Cuba, an analysis of a UN

economic study of Cuba which shows that rice production In Cuba

has declined 50% slico 1960, the Royal British Institute's

demonstrates that Great Britain 18 now gotting the botter part

AMSCROLI, continued its malling program to Cuba, but on a

further reduced scale.

During the quarter about 5,000 were

miled versus 5,800 during the previous quarter.

He count a

distribution during this quarter of 7,127 press releases azd

oconomie studies to places other than Cuba.

5.

A recent development which may have an interesting

operational potentlal was a telephone call to AUSCROL: {rom

the New York sugar brokers, which was

triggered by an ANSCBOLL "case study" of the problems being

tacod by a Cuban sugar mill.

The fire told AUSCROl, that 1f has

for some time suspected Cuban sugar production figures and

wondered 1f AUSCROLL had any such suspicions.

AuschOlL (through

1.

The AMKNOT organization continued during the quarter

under review with its progran of assisting Cuban merchant

mariners who have defected from their service.

•Fifteen diff

erent cases vere handled durlug this period which included

IIve resettlement cases in areas other than IMMAVE.

Billets

at sea were found for two more-one as a firet mate and one as

• third nate.

The remaining eight received assistance in obtain-

Ing employment or what might be called administrative aid ass15-

tance in obtaining social security numbers, ote.

- 2.

Processing continued for those interested in emplogment

by the Military Bea Transport Service (MSTS).

Progress 1n

obtaining the necessary U.8. Coast Guard certification is slow

and of the four that applied for this during the previous quarter

only two had received the certificationk the end of the current

quarter. During this quarter two nore former Cubar merchant

officers sought through ANKNOT this certification as they expressed

Interest 1 ISTS employment.

The current status is: In process 8;

Coast Guard certificationa received-2; physical examinations given

(and passed) 4.

In addition, applications for employment together

with the Coast Guard certifications and completed physical examin

ation forms were forwarded 28 December to the cover company in

Baltimore for 2.

The reminder will be forwarded as the Coast

Guard certifications are received.

3.

The activities of the ANKNOT organization continue to

receive publicity.

The Station has four clips from different

papers including one fron El Universal of Caracas.

ANKNOT issued

one press release during this quarter-which was an "eyewitness"

account of the attempt of four Cuban sailors to obtain political

asylum

in the Canary Islands.

In fact, this was a letter mailed

tO AMKNOT by 4USPOT-2 and signed in pseudonym.

B. ADMINIBTRATION

4, The AMNOT organization remains constituted

as reported

in the previous fuarterly Report.

However,

in December AMASK 1

was offered a pernanent position as personnel director of a local

shoe company that employs some four hundred people.

His starting

salary will be $475.00 per month which will be lacreased niter

the firet three months and increased again after the second three

montbs.

The Station concurred with AMASE-T that he accept. for

these reasons:

(1) The AKKNOT position is not permanent, (2)

It appears that AMASK-1 w111 be

terminated when AMKNOT 1a closed,

(3) this position should solve AlASk-l's personal financial prob

lens, and (4) AMASK has agreed to remain as chairman of ANKNOT

without salary and to continue to lend his name to the organization.

The Station oxpects to replace AMASk-] with AMPOLISH] who appears

qualifled to handle the hand-holding and housekeeping aspects of

AKKNOT •

AMPOLISH-1 1a presently employed by a local

automobile

denler and la able to take the necessary time off to handle the

AMKNOT matters.

We see three advantages to this development:

(1) The Station will be spared a possible disposal situation when

ANKNOT 1e closed (1t hag been made clear to AHPOLISH»] that this

1o a temporary assignment that at the most will last for a few

(2) We have offered AMPOLISH-I $200,00 per month versus

nontha)"405 ANASK-1, and (3) AMASK-, should be 10 an excellent

position to offer at least temporary employment in the shoe fac

tory to marinera to come.

5.

An entinated total of $2,505.00 was spent during this

quarter.

This anount represents AMASK-1's salary and allowances,

office expenses, and English Instruction for those seeking ISTS

enployment.

Espenses by month were:

October,

$855.00; November,

$825.00; and December (estinated), $825.00.

The allotment for

this activity for the quarter was

$3, 000.00.

5.

During the socond quarter of IT 67 the AMLIRA organzation

expended $17,300 and had income of sone $600 from news stand sales

and advertising.

Both these figures are approximate projections

because the final December figures are not recorded at this

writing.

The net figure for expenditures during the quarter (some

$18,700) exceeds the budgeted amount by approximately $400. However,

this overage will be absorbed in further budgetary cutbacks during

the neut reporting period.

6.

Tho AMLIRA activity expendituren also exceeded the budget

allowance during the loat quarter.

To renedy this situation the

following specifie economy measures vill go into effect begloning

I January 1967:

• One salaried enployoe will be dropped.

Monthly saving • • $250

Do

Publication of nonthly pamphlets with selected

offprints from the AMLIRA magazine will be

Approx. monthly saving. - $400

5650

It to expected that there will be other savings which whil bring

the total quarterly reduction in spending to about $2500.

B. ADMINISTRATION

5.

During the second quarter of FY-67 there were expendi

tures of approxinately $19,000 by the AMSTRUT-2 activity.

This

figure includes an estimate for the month of December because

the final Iigures lave not been received at this writing.

The

budgeted anount for AMSTRUI-? for the quarter 1e $24, 000 and there

18 an excess of budget authorization over expenditures of approzi

mately $5000.

This figure, however, gives an unreel budgetary

picture of the ALSTHUT-2 activity.

This $5000 w111 remnin as a

part of the budget allotment and may well be expended in a flurry

of AMSTRUT-2 travel, publication activity and or promotion during

• tha next quarter.

In other worda the excess docs not represent

budget. "fat" since the bulk of toe AMSTRUT-2 expenses are not

figured an month to month constants but obligated as the operational

altuntion demends.

6. During December AHSTRUT-2 moved into a smaller house with

• lower rent which wild mean a saving of $100 per month.

addition, it 1s anticipated that a further saving will be realised

in mintenance and upkeep costs.

Go PROBLEMS

The basle agent handling problem presented by AMSTRUT-?'s

excessive generosity and understandable

enotlonal approach to

mercurta! dispos1t1o0, he role which mat be played before the pub

11c still exists.

However, 1t seems to have lessened somewhat as

ANSTRUT? gaine confidence

in the language and in dealings with the

public.

There 1s little question that a contributing factor to the

lessening of this problem is the reliance placed by AWSTRUT-2 on

AMLYRIC] who serves as business advisor, buffer and hand holder.

B.

The problen of projecting the imge of the AMSTRUT-2 Founda

tion as an independent charitable organization remains.

The appli-

cation for tax enempt status to the

state of registry

is in the works

and when this application is approved it 1. likely that there will be

an increase of private donations which, because of the new statue, will

be tax deductible.

The problem lies in the dilatory behavior of the

state authorities.

AMSTRUT-2 contimes to be attractive to certain extremist

politiesi groupe whose patriotic claims of objectives would often

appear to parallel those of AMSTRUT-? and the Cuban extle community

as a whole.

AMSTRUT-2 has not always been able to sort out the "good

guys" from

the "bad guys"

and the problem lies in fending off these

extremiat groups and preventing then from exploiting AMSTEUT 3

for

partisan political ends.

(Letters Regarding Greek Shipping and Cuba

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

Action: FYI

economic research unit of AMSCROLL has throughout the past

year received

seven anonymous letters from Athens.

These letters

describe in detail Greek and Lebanese shipping with Cuba and appear

to have been written by someone knowledgeable of his subject.

The

author apparently has access to ANSCROLL publications as he makes

reference

to "your circulars".

We forward a set of these lett.rs

by separate covor as they may

be of interest and of possible use.

The AiSCROLL shipping studies have made a veiled acknowledgment of

receipt of this

material by referring to information received.from

friends in Greece; however, AbSCRoLL has used

only those facts that

we can check out here.

AS

indicated on certain of the letters

copies of various ones have been sent to the "Ministry for Foreign

Affairs, Washington"; the U.S. Ambassador; London; or the U.S.

Ambassador, Athens. A copy of the last letter received by ANSCROLL was

sent all three.

Dear Dr. Rivas-Vasquez:

In response to your letter of November 19th, concerning

Greek and Lebanese shipping to Red Cuba ports, I am enclosing

some information I have obtained which should fulfill your

requirements.

In the case of the Lebanese Directives, you

will note that no specific reference is made to shipping to

Cuba®

Despite the fact that the enclosed information is not

elessified or restricted, it was obtained from a sensitive

source and I would appreciate it if you would handle this

matter discreetly.

We have been very pleased with the information your

orgenization has been providing us concerning shipments to

Cuba.

I hope tha: the data provided will be helpful to you.

Very sincerely yours,

CUBAN TRADINS

Your circulars regarding, Cuban affairs and trading contain useful

Infornation but it seems that neither you nor the American Authorities

are well informed. You know that, through inerican pressurefor brack flag

Government banned, several years ago, all trading with Cuba

vessels, except few which were on timecharter and were allowed to run

their charters, w.ich finished a very long time ago. Similarly, the Lebano

Government banned

all trading with Cuba for Lebanon vessels, fer months

and

only alloi,

from and and to countries of the Arab League.

Both countries passed laws.

to this effect, and both state that infringement of the law carries very

heavy fines against the Omers and Masters,

and withdrawal of the flag.

That is what the laws say, but what is actually happening is another

just look on, doing nothing about it, and

this means that the laws were made,

LA CALIDAD ACTUAL DEL AZUCAF CUBANO

Por el Ingeniero Raúl Esparza Tabares

ex-Director de Investigaciones Tecno-

16gicas del Ministerio del Azúcar (MINAZ) de Cuba Comunista

Este breve análisis de la calidad actual del azúcar cubano va dirigido tanto al

perito en azúcares (como paso inicial de lo que podría convertirse en un estudlo mas

técnico y exhaustivo) como al lectos ordinarlo, toda vez que, en Cuba, el azúcar

• casi sinonimo

de rrosperidad económica, y así, la calidad del azúcar desempeña un pa

pel de gran importancia en la situación econónica global del país (1).

Sin mas comentarlos o notas de Introducción, ofrecemos a continuación el análi-

sis de la calidad actuál del azúcar cubano

lo Materias. Extrañass

a) Azúcar. crudos la Industria azucarera cubana

se caracterizaba por recibir pa

ra su procesamiento, la mejor calidad de çaña de azúcar en cuante a su contenido de-

materias extrañas (menos del 3), Actualmente y por causa de los trabajadores " ve

luntarios" por un lado y por otro a la mecanización de la cosecha de la caña, las ma-

terlas extrañas que acompañan a la caña al llegar al Central para su procesamiento •

ha aumentado al 8% en el caso de los voluntarios y al 19% en el caso de las máquinas

de cortar caña soviéticas. • Es: de. señalarse que dentro de la composición de estas ma

• terias extrañas está incrida la tierra, y como quiera que las tierras de Cuba tienen

en su comnosiclón un alto contenido de arcillas, estas son muy difíciles de eliminar

en el proceso tecnológico de purificación y afectan grandemente la calidad del azú

car crudo.

b) Azúcar Refino, Las materias extrañas, principalmente arcillas de las tierras

llegan hasta el azúcar refino dándole color al mismo y dejando residuos

insolubles

al ser disueltas esta azúcar. 'Esto disminuye la calidad del azúcar refino no sola =

mente para el consumo humano directo, siro que ocasiona graves perjuicios en los 1n-

dustrias de alimentos que utilizan el azúcar refino. Lo mismo sucede con las indus-

trías de refrescos.

.(1) No es necesario ensalzar la calidad del azúcar cubano que producía antes de

castro, ya que su prestigio en el mercado mundial es un hecho de sobra cong

cido.

Lo mismo puede decirse de los técnicos cubanos en azucar, con quie

nes los expertos internacionales han tenido amplia oportunidad de discutir

los asuntos azucareros a intercambiar ideas y sugerencias libremente. Esta

2. Polarización:

a) Azúcar crudo, En frocas anteriores al regimen comunista, Cuba no producía azu-

cares crudos con polarizaciones menores de 97.0 a 97:5 %, y para muchos mercados

tranjeros se roducían azúcares crudos con polarizaciones superlores a 98.0%

actualidad un perelento significativo de la roducción

no alcanza esos valores, dán:"

dose casos de azúcaros crudos con polarizaciones de 96.0 y 95.0 %

b) Azucar Refinos las calidades mejores de azúcares refinos o blancos se

en los mercados internaclonales principalmente por su grado de polarización, la cual

deberá ser cono mínimo 99.9%.. Los azúcares refinos en la actualidad bajo el réginer-

comunista no alcarsan esa cifra, manteniéndose entre 99.70 y 99.80 %

b) Azúcar Retinos La deficiente tecnología y el mal estado de los equipos apropia

de casi un 70%.

Ademãs azúcares provucidos con bajo contenido de humedad en las rell

nerías, son alterados por el

mal estado de los almacenes.

4* Materias insolublegs

a) Azúcar Crudo, El contenido de materias Insolubles en el azúcar crudo ha aumenta

do aproximadamente en un 250% debido a la mala purificación de los Jugos de caña duran

te el proceso tecnológico, y a la introducción de materias extrañas conjuntamente

con

la caña que van a parar hasta el azúcar.

b) Azúcar Refing, El uso de azúcares erudos de baja calidad, la deficiente calidad

la Tierra de Infusorios, y el Carbón Activado, productos éstos en

víados por los países comunistas, han tenido como consecuencia un aumento del porcenta

jo de materias insolubles en los azúcares refinos de aproximadamente el 200%, reducien'

do considerablemente la calidad de estos ázúcares refinos.

5 . Colos:

a) Azúcar Cruido, El Índice de color de los azúcares crudos ha aumentado casi en un

lo que reduce proporcionalmente la calidad de estos crudos como matería prima en

las refinerías.

b) Azúcar Refino: Este es uno de los factores importantés en la calidad de los azu

cares refinos o blancos, y en los años recientes, debido a deficienclas tecnológicas,"

a la ausencia casi total de técnicos con experiencia, y a la baja calidad de los mate

a) Azúcares Invertidos, Debido a la deficiencia tecnológica y a la baja calidad -

de los azúcares

años en un 50%, afectando la calidad de estos azúcares.

c) Contenido do Azufre (50g), El contenido de arufro en los azúcares rofinados de

d) Contenido de Arsónicos- El Arsénico es una de las contaminacionos que mas ales

A mi lado se encuontra mi señora Josefa Reus y nuestros hijos Roberto, de 21

años y Raúl, de 22 años, arbos estudiantes de ingenferfa de la Universidad de La

Antes de hacer un brevo relato de la odisea de mi familia para abandones el

país, deseo agradecer a los compañeros de UNIDAD REVOLUCICNARIA las atenciones

que han tenido para con nosotros y al mismo tiempo por darme esta oportunidad de

hacer estos doclaraciones a los periodistas del mundo libre.

Desde hace dos años todos nos encontrabamos tratando de abandonas el país pe-

ro nos había sido Imposible. a mi no se no permitía salir debido al cargo que oy

paba y ni siquiera se le daba esta oportunidad al resto de mi familia, Cuando lo

de Camarloca nos fué a recoger un barco y las autoridades cubanas ni nos avisaron

de que dicha embarcación se encontraha allí. La única salida era abandonas el pala

en bote nor la vía clandestina, La oportunidad se presentó durante mi estancia en

Londreso Yo había salido de Cuba el 23 de febrero de 1946 dejando atrás a mi seño

ra y a mis dos hijos, uno do los cuales, Raúl, se encontraba enfermo de hepatitio.

en La Habana.

M1 señora tuvo que tomar la decisión sin encontrarme yo a su lado, pero había

que aprovechar la oportunidad que se presentaba y salir por la vía clandestina del

naís. De la odisea puoden dar detalles ellos mucho nejor a,a yo y posiblemente 1o8

mienhros de la prensa desearán hacerles algunas preguntas al final de mis palabras.

Muy brevemente los diré oue ellos se sometleron al mismo proceso que tantos .....

otros cubanos se han sometido, es decir, lanzarse en bote a srumar el "corredor de

la muerte" con la

confianza que Dios los ayudarla a arribar a tierras de libertado

Dos intentos fallaron pero por fin, el tercer intento fué un éxito y al menos el

grupo completo, unas veinte personas, se montaron en el bote y pusieron proa a los

Estados Unidos, el motor se rompló y la travesía fué la mayor parte del tiempo a

aterrorizados como por la nopa se acercaba velozmente una lancha patrullera cuba-

Yo mo encontraba en el hotel en Londres y una llamada de larga distancia me

puso al corriente de la situación. Ellos se encontraban a salvo y ahora ne toca-

Estos me observaban atentamento, como queriersis adivinar lo que en me decía des

de

actor teatral y simular que la llamada era oficial desde Cuba.

Anto esta situación, optó por informas, falsamente, a los restantes deiega-

dos que el gobierno cubano me había encargado el cuidado de otros asuntos, por

lo que tendría que demorarme algunos días mas de los previstos en Madrid.

Los dije también

que me reservaran pasaje a bordo del vuelo de la semana sl

culente y les entregué

una carta para mi familia. Llegué a Madrid el A de Mar-

80. Las autoridades españolas me brindaron toda clase de facilidades, incluso

posteriormente la de ofrecerme hasta protección personal, puesto que cuando en el

MINAZ se conoció mil desaparición, el gobierno notificó a las embajadas cubanas en

londres y Madrid que me encontraran y que me llevaran de regreso para La Habana

aunque tuviera que ser a bordo de un buque cubano y por supuesto, en contra de mi

voluntade

car de "caótica". La falta de personal técnico capacitado y de obreros especia

lizados hacen que la operación de producción de los ingenios sea altamente defl

ciente. Por otra parte, la falta de abastecimiento de caña no permite que 108'10

génios funcionen a su capacidad normal, trayendo como consecuencia poca eficien

cia en el trabajo y un alto consumo de combustible adicional, que ocasiona un ay

mento considerable en los costos de producción del azúcar. En relación con los

medios de transporte, rincipalmente los ferrocarriles azucareros, deseamos acla

rar que se encuentran también en pésimas condiciones, a pesar de la adquisición

de locomotoras souléticas, inglesas y francesas, pues las vías férreas no permi

ten el aprovechamiento de este material rodante. Por ejemplo, durante 1965 se

debían de haber cambiado sois millones de traviesas en las vías férreas, mas sin

embargo sólo había diponibles ochenta mil. El resultado es el incremento de los

descarrilamientos que durante la zafra de 1969 alcanzaron un promedio de tres des

carrilamientos diarios, produciendose diez accidentes mortales.

Muchos me preguntan cual será la producción final de la zafra de 1966 y so

bre este punto debo hacer los comentarlos siguientoss Fidel Castro anunció que

la meta azucarera de este año serían 6.5 millones de toneladas y ese anuncio no

sólo fue hecho durante su discurso del Iro. de mayo de 1955, sino que lo repitió

durante su discurso del y de Junio del mismo año. Sin embargo, se admito que di

cha metá no será alcanzada. Ahora bien el estimado actual no excede de 5.1 mi

llones de toneladas®

¿Por qué?

Primeramente se debe mencionar la falta de abono. Este año la aplicación

..do abono fue insignificante, pues el gobierno no tenía las divisas necasarias par.

ra adquirirlo, principalmente en Italia.

El año pasado, sin embargo, se aplica-

## Page 202

son aproximadamente 450,000 toneladas.

En segundo lugar, resulta necesarlo hacer referencla à las sombras de caña.

Las nuevas areas sembradas de caña lo han sido de forma deficiente y además se han

utilizado

areas destinadas con anterioridad a la siembra de otras cosechas para.

sembrar caña, como lo constituye, Dor sólo citar un ofenio, el caso de la zona

situada en los alrededores de Manzanillo y Bayamo, las cuales eran zonas arroco

ras y ahora han intentado convertirlas en zonas cañoras, resultando todo esto en

un fracaso pues la caña es de baja calidad al no sor adecuado el suelo.. Otro fas

tor menos importante poro digno de darse a conocer es la falta de cuidado en las

tareas de cultivo y atención de los cañaverales debido a la escasez de mano de 2

bras

Con estos antecedentes es que hay que analizar el monto de la presente zafra.

Durante 1965 el día y de abril se alcanzó el cuarto millón, pero este año el ter.

cer millón se alcanzó el día 3 de abril lo cual ya significa un atraso de cerca

de 900,000 toneladas. Creo que hay caña para llegar a 5.1 millones de toneladas

ahora bien, lo que hay que preguntarse es si dicha mota, que ya está bastante por

dobajo de los 6.5 millones anunciados por Fidel Castro será alcanzada o no. El

Partido está realizando una movilización masiva record hacia los cañaverales con

el propósito de intentar cortar toda. la caña pero eso hay que ver si en defini-

tiva lo logran hacer.

Cabe hacer referencia en este momento a lo que se conoce en Cuba por el nog

bre de "pian Perspectivo Azucarero", que es el único plan económico que tiene en

estos momentos el gobierno de Cuba.

¿Qué es el "Plan Perspectivo Azucarero"' comprende tres puntos básicos que

son los siguientess primero, la "rehabilitación" de la capacidad industrial a ni

veles pre-Castros segundo, la "ampliación" de la capacidad industrial, y tercero,

la "concentración" de la Industria azucarera en 70 modernos centrales.

Vamos a tevisar brevemente los tres puntos a la luz de la presente situación.

En relación con el primero, o sea, la "sehabilitación" de la capacidad Industrial...

instalada, es necesario destacar que en 1952 la capacidad de producción de la in

dustrla azucarera era de siete millones de toneladas, pero debido a la escasez

de piezas de repuesto, falta de materiales para las reparaciones,. baja calidad de

las roparaciones y la eliminación de seis ingenios - que fueron precisamente des

mantelados para utilizar las plezas como repuestos lo cual ea ha comprobado ha 51

do un error más - la capacidad industrial se ha reducido a sólo seis millones de

toneladas, es decio, que la actual política ha resultado en la presente merma de

la producción ¡qué progreso! Fidel Castro no ha podido ni alcanzar la capael e

---

## Page 203

dal de reducción azucarera nue Cuta tenía hace nuince años.

El segundo punto, que en cierto sentido debe atemnerarse al primero, es am=-

ollar la canacidad industrial Instalada y ademis construir un nuevo ingenio. Esto

significaría, o sea, para alcanzar esto serfa necesario la importación da un núme

maro considerable de enuipos-para los incentos, cosa totalmente imposible de lle

varse a cabo debido a la escasez de divisas de por sí escasas para la adquisición

de piezas de repuesto- y la falta de técnicos para hacerse cargo de sucervisar y

@jecutar dicha ampliación - también se dete decir que tampoco son suficientes los

técnicos para realizar de por sí las labores ordinarlas de la zafra con la actual'

capacidado Este parte del plan supone una coordinad ón entre el INA - que sien.

bra la caña - y el MiNaz, pero lo ole sucede en la realidad es que no están en

coordinación ambos organismos y por consiguiente el INRA manda a sembrar cara en

donde no existe canacidad industrial y por su parte el MINAZ está "rehabilitando"

Ingenlos en donde a lo mejor ya no hay suficiente caña. Esto es sólo una muestra

de la desorganización reinante, desorganización que unida a los factores, menciona

dos Imposibilitan el éxito del "Plan Perspectivo". Esto es una prueba más de la.

Incapacidad de la planificación econónica de las altas esferas en dicho gobierno.

(Por cierto que la construcción del nuevo ingento es vital para el éxito del

"Plan" y hasta el momento presente sílo una firma francesa ha hecho ofertas para

dicha construcción, dicha firma es nada menos que la FIVES-LILLE, bien conocida

en los círculos azucareros).

La tercera fase del "plan", es decir, la "concentracón" de la capacidad in

dustrial azucarera en setenta ingenios después de 1970 es sólo un sueño en la men

te de los planificadores. La regresión constante de la industria azucarera no

puede permitis, económicamente hablando, el modernizar y automatizar plantas y

equipos, hasta que los problemas económicos básicos de la producción no estén re-

sueltos.

Los equipos soviéticos no son aptos para realizar estas tareas agrícolas en -

Cuba y su diseño y diffcil

operación impiden que cumplan su cometido. Aderas es

das "cortadoras" introducen un 1986 de materias extrañas en el ingenio, lo cual --

ocasiona gran desgasto a las máquinas y equipos del ingenio. Y es procisamente

con estos equipos soviéticos con los cuales se contaba para cosechar 83 millones

de toneladas de caña que serían necesarias para producir los 10 millones de tone

ladas de azúcar anunciados por Fidel Castro como los "10 megatones de azúcar" con

los que iba a derrotar al "Imperialismo' en 1970.

Las metas de producción del "Plan" son las siguientes, Para 1965: 6 millones

de toneladase para 19668 E.5 millones! para 1967s 7.5 millones- para 1968: 8 i=-

Alones: para 1969, 9 millones: y finalmente, para 1970: 10 millones de toneladas

de azúcar"" Estimo que el único en Cuba que aún creo en el "Plan" y en sus metas

es Fidel Castro,

No gustaría hacer una breve referencia en relación con otro problema básico

- la baja calidad del azúcar cubano, tanto crudo como refino, actualmente en proce

so de empeorarse. Esto no ha sucedido de casualidad sino como consecuencia de la

• falta y mala calidad de las piezas de repuesto, la ineficiencia en la operación de

los Ingenios, la falta de eficiencia de los trabajadores, y la baja calidad de 10s

•productos químicos auxiliares procedentes de países socialistas. Estos problemas

están resultando en una decreelente polarización del azúcar, el envase deficiento

del azúcar de exportación, el aumento de impurezas en el azúcar embarcada a granel,

y las dificultades en cumplir los compromisos de entregas de azucares.

Otro tema de Interés lo constituye la presencia de los "técnicos azucareros"

soviéticos en Cuba. El régimen cuenta en la actualidad con unos 300 técnicos azu

careros soviéticos quienes se supone que sean los sustitutos de los técnicos cuba

nos que han abandonado el país. Los técnicos soviéticos tienon muy poca experien

cla en azúcar de caña y la forma en que dicha industria opera en Cuba. Además muy

pocos hablan escañol y esto les hace aún más difícil su labor. Por lo tanto ni los

técnicos soviéticos ni los equipos soviéticos constituyen una solución para el que:

bradero de cabeza azucarero de Fidel Castro.

Con esto deseo dar por terminada estas declaraciones. Dejo ahora la palabra a

los miembros de la prensa para contestarles cualquier pregunta en relación, no so-

10 a mis palabras, sino a la situad ón política Interna que es un interesante fenó

meno de desintegración, la odisea de mi familia, el problema de la Universidad en

donde desempeñaba una cátedra, así como cualquier otro tema que resulte de interés.

Dear Prof, Gardlunds

I am pleased to enclore the information that you requested

In your kind lotter of 5/5/66, which I hope will be userul to you in your studies

of price and cost trends in the eno sugar industry.

As you probably know, the Curan suras industry ranked Mrst

placo as a producor of cone

sugar, not only with rogards to largo production vol

ames, but also as concerns high technical efficiency and low produotion costs.

Beforo 1959, the maximan production cost was of 3.5 cente a

round, excopting, of course,

the smallor and moro inofficiont sugar midis that

had not dovolopod any tnchnologienl advancos since world war It.

However, in

1965 the coat of production was as high as 5.25 cente a pound, even though, of

dourse, this latter figuro 18 carefully concealod by the Conmunist rogine that

rulos my country.

I would like to acquaint you with the Economic Research Bu

reau of the UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA Movemont.

This organiantion 1s mado up of true

Guban oconomista in exilo. I am suro that

you will find this a very valuable

source of information concerning Cuba's economy.

I thank you very much for the kind and humane phrases that

you havo had for my family and for myself.

Thank Heaven, after throe long years

wo vore able to escapo, even if at the risk of our own lives, from the Comunist

holl. We have como to

this froe land in the hope that we can start our lives all

ovor again under the kind hospitality of this groat Nation, the free and denocrat

le Uhited Statos of America.

Please by assured, my dear Professor,, that I am pleased to

place mysels at your service.

Should you desire any informtion concerning the

Cuban sugar industry, I will be more than glad to furnish it to you.

I also

nope that, very soon, a rogimo of lihorty, justice and democratio econonio de

valopmant will prevail in my suffering Fathorland.

Sincerely yours,

The Station is nttempting

to improve both tho punch and the

Furthor, we are trying to rofino tho "irritability"

sensitivity of Castro to

this type of attack.

"Intripuce about the Trl-Contlnont-1 Confurence" - Ben larks, the nactermind of the

"TI-Continental Conferenco schoduld for Invann, myrtoriously dinapperred in Farir.

He rcmomber that, whon It was thought that this conferenco would ho hold in Algoria

undor Chinose sponcorchip, its mastorminde, Che Guevara and Bon Holln, disappeared.

Tho character who took up

Che's role in this Conference, Ben Barks, now vanishes in

Paris. Could it be that what happoned to Bon tolls la n'out to happen to Fidel?

November 3, 1965: "Hou Abject Can Castro Hel".- In his recont statement to three

Amerionn and one Spanish journalisto, Cratro appears arrorant and acte as though he

didn't care for an "aggiornamento' with the U.!. Howover, from the contest of his

statomonto it is quite obvious thit he would like nothing botter than boing reminit

tod to the Intin Amoricar community and getting the bleseing of the u...

lis attitude must have boon a terrible dinappointmont to his followore, who must

necessarily soo it as evidence that the U.r...R. is in full retrent in ite econonie

war with the U.r. over Cuba.

"Roticenese That Roveal Innincurity, Caution and Fear",- At last, the Old Cuard has

spoken out through Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, following the dovastrting, "purge" that 1t

underwent in the hands of Fidel Castro. But foar of a recond, bloody phaso, of the

purge has kept Carlos Rafael Rodriguez from openly attacking Fidel Cretro. Instead,

he has taken resource to veiled reticence and references to Fidel Castro's "petty.

burgeo1s" past, mixed with inaincere prairen, in ordor to make it known that the

"clarica" of Marxien-Leniniem still distruot Fidel. If their differences with the

"now wave" are really a think of the pact, why does Old-Guard man Carlos Rafnel now

bring up the fnet that Fidel was not one of them at the leginning, and that he was

not a true Marxist Leniniat?.

Noveber 4e 1965: "The Renction to Camrioon: Chatrole Resentment and Bltternees".-

Castro'a vow to let diseatlafied Cubans out was his own error of appreciation. Pres

ident Johnson took the challenge and then Cartro tried

to sound out the U.., for co

existentialist overtures. Hence his rejection of the Red Cross to mediate in the

matter. His bitter reaction forbidding

"ore on Corlos Re Rodripuiz' Elatmonte", - In his statoroner, Carlos R. Rodrleues

has uncovered that Fidel Cartro has croater the objoctivo conditiono for fractional

work within the Party with the exclucion of the Old Guard and of the Stulents Diroe-'

torate from the oxecutive bodies of the Party. This revonlr 1 state of internal

rift and decomposition, and such rovolation, coming from a cigrifleant Old Guard

source ruch as Rodriguez, foretsile rather unproictable consequences.

November 5, 195: "Sittine Lull (Carlos Patrol) Has Spoken!" Emphasis on Carlos

Kafnel Rodriguez' perronal festuren, on hin am ition to bocome the Cuban Rovolution's

"Lenin", all of which dreans have boon torn to piocos by Caoiro. Likewise, Carlos

Pafael, etrengthened by Mo: cow's backing, has pointed out, though in a rather subtle

manner, the sction of the unknown men of the Party In tho strugelo agninet casurolsi.

This he did when he indirectly chargod that Cactro war a petty-burgeols.

"Cretro Goupht bie Fingere on the boor and the Door Elammed on his Nose". - Bocruse

his situation 1a more difficult every dry, Chatro hintod that his conversationg on

the Curan exodus meant the beginning of deopor negotiatione ilth the U... This 18

falee. Cutan Communism is not nepotiable. When President Johnson oponed the doors

of the U.!, to all Cubana, he left 1t well esthliched that this was done because of

humanitarian reasons, and that Cubane would be wolcomed here until they could proturn

to their homeland and find it free from fear".

loganter 5, 1965: "Stop thie lionsense ee Where 1a Cho Cuevara?". - Where is Che Gue-

vara? Thie le a quest on that conctantly hannere on Fidel's cars, whenever Journal-

Inte, diplomate, etco, ask it to him. Besieged by this quertion, Castro one day told

a correcpondent for the ladrid dally "Pueblo": "I think that Guevars may never return

to Cuba. He may be somewhere in Argentina". Castro, like Stalin did before hing

Spanich tormentors were going to leavon, then he didn't want to so to Heaven.

Similarly, 1f Heaven 1e Castro's Red parallee, the doctore and techniciane want out

"What About, the Tri-Continental Conferener?".

The abduction and disappearance of

Ben Barka eema to have suspended preparatione for the Tri-Continental Conference

that the Reds had scheduled for, January in Havans. Judging by the klonapping of the

chiof orranizer, this Conferenco, which ie rejected ky China, la riven the came treat

all or not.

* November 9, 1965: "that Goes From One Hox. Ith to the Other". - We recrll that on

Nov. 7, last year,

Castro was interviewed by a correspondent for the New York Times.

At the same

time, he said that he would down whatever American U-2 planes he could

military alllance with the lo'...R.. Now, a year later; his heart bleeding over his

parting with Red China, an' un'er trutal soviet pressure, Castro's Nov. Y speech

inaugurating a hospital sounds like that of a "conatructive" ruler whose concern 1s

for the wolfare of the people, and who niks that eame people "to march up the (socia-

list) path".

He is no longer arromnt. Ho belatedly begs for the people's support.

Thrt About Latin American Corrunist Partles?".- Castro disnissed the fact that

Chin did not groet the roorminization and chango of the Cuban Communist iarty, but

spite and concern were obvious in the tone of his voice. Cas"ro knows that re has

botrayed Chinn. On the other hand, the Communist Partles of Latin America have not

addrorned Chatro any conpratul-tory messnges either, which indicates that they are

boginning to turn their backs on him on account of his "purging" of the old guard.

Under such conditions, Cartro's subservience to loscow is grenter every day. Castro

has entored the most unsurnountable phase of his crisis.

& November 10, 1965: "The Regson and Nature of the Economic Rlockade".- From Castro's

Nov. Ith speech it may be deducted that the U.s.i.R. has only been able to supply him

with weapone, bullets and cannons. We stato the reasons why the U...r.R. will not be

able to invest more in Cubs, and that, at the same time, the nations of this Hemisp

here will continue thoir economic boycott of Castro's Cuhr. There can be no economie

coexistence between Red Cubs and the rest of the Continent.

"Continental Resistance to Arpression". - Even though the Lima meting of military

chiefe from 17 American countries did not trke up the question of the Inter American

Army, the serembled chiefs unquestionably took a step towards its establishment, which

will be ultimately decided on by the ?.A... Aggression to the Doninican Reublie,

and persirtence in Cuba-drafted subversive plans against the rest of the Hemisphere,

lovember l1, 1965: "Coexictence Dreams Come Tumbling, Down", - Therla: There can be no

under pressure from Krruchchey, he bepan his first conciliatory overtures with the United

Itates. Nikita had pleaded geographical and economic impoccibility to maintain his com

mitments with the Gaetro tyranny, Result: The Soviot Union cannot continually support

Castro and the U.í., on sléir part, rejectscastro-Communism. In faco of this altuation,

the men in the Cuban armed forces and in the government have only one dignified course

of action: to remove the despot. from power in order that. Cubs may emergo from chaos and

tragody.

"The O.A.s. Should Not Portpone Its Meeting".- The same Cretroite agrression that.

earlier forced the postponement of the 0.1.:. Conference now warrants that the Conference

no longer be postponed. The

said aggression has crented a situntion that demands new

Instrurents and agencies to put the O.A.S. in stape to face up to the subvercive threat

planned and executed in Cuba. The process that startod at Punte del Este must be brought

to a cuccessful end: the re-esteblishment of democracy in Gube go that the Pearl of the :

Antilles may rejoin the Inter-American system.

November 12, 1965: This program was entirely devoted to reading Dr. Sciplie's article

entitled "There Will Never Be Coexistence Or "Naking Up' between Castro-Communism and

the Free Peoples of the Hemisphere".

November 13, 1965: "Cuba's Internal Econoric Front 1s Disastrour". - Castro, seeing that

he'll never accomplish "coexletence" with the U.s-, and that the USER 1s Eradually With

drawing Its assisiance to his regime, seeks refuge. in the internal econonie front, and

tries to increase the agricultural production of the peasante. The open failure of said

RAdiO SUMMARiES.

Decomicr 1, 1965:

"The Soviets Cer The Furnr Harvo:t To ftart"- While Padl

sought military and economic ain in tho USTR, Flirl Cretro deflantly warned that the

rugar hurvest would bigin as late ar Jon. 7. Fut back came Rail from inscow, not with

a pledge of subelantial aid, but with intrictione to have the harvert begin immertate

Iy. That is why Castro chanrer his stratory an! lunchor the harvest right ausy.

"Whrt Is The Tri-Continental Conference?",- In 4c flort place, the Trl Contirer"al

Conference doer not ropresent the countries of threo continentr, as ite orgarizere

claim, but rather the Corniuniste nn' terrories crom the ro-called "overente or ntion

al liberation" in those countrier. In the recond

place, the Conference in a retting

for tho Eino Soviet strurglo for the landerrhiy of the African and Asian Commurict

Parties, and the struugle goes on ami'st intrime, mancuvrs, abductione ard murdere.

December Ze 1995: "Cuba Cannot Roturn To The Latin Anerican World".- Once more Dean

Ruck has clearly stated that, in order to bo admitter lack into the Inter-herican

cortunity, Cubs must first severe its tier with the USfR and quit subvercion and 1n

filtration in this Continent. Castro's frionds inalie the 0.1.i, Who harboured hopee

of iringing Cuba back into the Orgnizntion, sould atendon them. Thore "holler-than-

thou" characters who protend to defend relf-determination and non-intervenvention in

publie, privately charge Cartro-Communism and its accrecsione.

nA Double-Play Agninot Peking And Castro",= By moans of the Tri-Continental Conference,

which sunrizes a phace of marcuvering and counter-mancurring within the fino-soviet

rift, the Kremlin has manared to out ult the Chirece, take control of Airicar, heian

and Latin merican Comw-Ist Partied, and feel a death blow to Castro'e dream of becos-

ing the role leader

of the Latin

comments the internal situ-tion of Cuba and Castro-Communism at the time

of Gromyko's departure from the Island. Mention is made of growing dis

content, of restlessness and dissatisfaction among Cubans, plus the

destruction of Cuba's light industry and agriculture. Other woes of the

Castroites are elaborated on, and, in the end, we call on those who form

part of the Castro government, but who nevertheless love Cubs, to help

put an end to the Red monster and to the anguish of the people.

annihilated all the sports in Cuba and the country has been eliminated

Introduced by U.R. Secrotary General Mario Seiglic, spoke for the group. Said Co

nist maned Varuel Jorge Curvo lenéndes, whose provious job was to run concentra-

tion camps in the Isle of lines.

Tho Cuban akipper referred to 11l-treatment of Cuban soamen by the Castro rogime,

mentioning among other. instances the constant spying on board by G-2 meng prefer

ential Custons treatment given Comunist-Bloc sailorsgand the ridiculously low lo

cal-curroncy allowance of $5 per weok given to tho Cutans while in foreign ports.

Elaborating on the lue of expionage, Capt. Cobas revealed that the radio and tel

egraph operator 1e usually the G-2 van on board. lo captain of the "Aracello", Co-

bas himoolf was forced to. surrender the mail of supposedly "disloyal" crewmen to

one of the aples assigned to his ship.

As rogardo operation conditions of the Curan merchant fleat, Cohas told newsmen ..

that the two basic problems confronted by Cuban shitbing are the obsolete Soviet

saulpmont inctalled in most boats and the excessive buronucratie red tape and dis

organization.

a example of the latter, he montioned the fact, that the cuban buy

ng agency seldon informs the shipping coordinating offico of the dates oh which -

Laot-minute notices and sub-

sequent offorts to find thips usually noe' failure, with the result that the seller

must pay higher warchouse costs. This he caused rany foreign firms to either ie

fuse to trade with Castro or to impose extronely harsh terms to protect themselvea

from the coctly effects of t'g Comunists' unreliability.

Capt. Francisco Cobas then revealed that he understood that a vast "reorganization"

of the Cuban Havy was undertaken early this fall.

Most officers, he said, were dig

charged on the grounds of suspected "disloyalty" to the government.

Incidentally,

added Cobas, some retired Army officers who have had no naval experience, have also

been assigned to the merchant varine. Cobas assured his audience that their deci

sion to quit was made of their own free will and that no one had pressured them

into 1t.

le denounced Communist oppression of his homeland and said that ho and his

three shipmates refused to keep serving under 1t.

Following Capt. Cobas' statement, the newsmon aoked him numerous questions.

A continunción, Cobas pasó a explicar que el apoyo logístico a los Viot Cong'-

constituye una de las tareas encomendadas al nuevo embajador cubano en Tokyo, un co

munista fanático nombrado

lanuol Jorge Cuervo Monóndos que tuvo a su cargo la adral-

nistracion de varios campos do concentración on Isla de Pinos.

Refiriéndoso a los malos tratos que reciben los marinos cubanos, Cobas monciono

la constante vigilancia a quo ostín sometidos a bordo por ol 62 comunista, así como

& las consideraciones

especialos do aduana que se dan a los tripulantes de buques de

otros paises comunistas y a la ridícula cantidad ($5 semanalos) en monoda local que

se da a los marinos cubanos para

sus gastos en puertos extranjoros.

Dotallando la

cuestión de la vigilancia, rovoló ol capitán Cobas que on la mayoría de los buques

cubanos el G2 do a bordo suelo ser ol radiotelografista.

Como capitán del "Arace

I10 Iglesias", el propio Cobas so vio obligado a ontregarlo a otro agento policíaco

dostacado a bordo

toda la corrospondencia de ciertos tripulantes supuestamente des

loalos al réginon.

Tambión dijo Cobas a los poriodistas que los principalos problenas que confronta

la navogación cubana los constituyon los equipos sovióticos anticuados instalados en

muchos buques y las complicaciones y confusiones burocraticas. Como ejemplo de este

¡timo, señaló Cobas que la agencia oficial de comóras dol regimen cubano cast munes

comunica a la coordinadora do flotos (CUFLET) la focha en que deborá cargarse alguna

mercancía en puorto extranjero.

Dicha fecha no se avisa hasta última hora, fracasan

All Cuban ships have orders to carry cargo to North Vietnam to help the

North Vlotnamese war effort. The Cuban Enbassy in Japan Is asting as the coor

dinator for all shipments of war natorial to North Vlotnam via Cuban shipe from

Communist porte in Asia. The Cutan Embassy In Tokyo had secretly arranged for

tho Aracollo Iglosias to take a shipmont of war meterials from North lorea to

North Vlotnam. In order to hide their intentions, the Embassy arranged that the

(racello itinorary be kept up in the air until the last possible moments then to

fool the crow and the Japaneso they gave the

story the ship would return to Japan

to lead tin cargo at Yahate and thon procood on routo to North Vietnam. In real-

Ity, wo wero to roceive instructions on itinerary while in North Korea telling

us to procood directly to North, Vlotnam after loading the war supplios.

At the last moment, howover, tha Embasay was informed that the port of

Chinnampo was blocked by ice. The Cuban Embassy then hastily arranged for us to

pick up a shipment of arms in Shangal previously scheduled for another Cuban

boat about the ond of January,

Logistical support to tho North Viotnamese is one of the two tasks assigned

to Mr. Nanuol Jorge Cuervo,: the now Cuban Ambassador to Japan. His other func

of the fornor trade Counselor to Japar, Gilborto Morany. The Cuban government

le very concerned about the prospect of declining trade since already some comp

anies that formerly traded with Cuba, will no longer do so openly.

In general, I may say that menberg of the Cuban merchant marine live under

unbearable conditions. The treatmant we roceive is so bad that no one foala

like cooperating with the marine purposes of the regime, even in the few cases

where there might be no ireological Incompatibility involved.

As examples of this treatment I say mention the constant spying on board

by members of the "G-2". For some reason, the "G-2" ran on board is usually the

radio and talegraph operator. In the "Aracello" we had one by the name of Eduar

cerves last minute notice that the merchandice will be rcady for loading.

CUFLET takes paine to find a versel in time but, more ofton than not, ite hasty

ABSTRACT

ANCEDFILA

As Headquarters is aware, JMWAVE is refuting on a con

tinuing basis and via all appropriate assets commentaries

similar to that discussed in the reference.

As for this

particular GOMEZ broadcast the Station prepared a guidance

for AMSCROLL use, primarily its radío, the point of which

was that GOMEZ had become eligible for the

"Foot "n Mouth

Club" due his admission

on 21 October that Camarioca was a

plebiscite and his statement on 22 October, no doubt as a

result of a prod from his Communist superiors that "I think

I made

excessive concessions..." explaining that the people

are really leaving due to economic reasons.

We agree and

say that the economic reasons are to obtain three meals a

day, to be able

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

We forward undor separate cover subjoct publication which was

recently sent to AMSCROLL mail recipients interested in economic

materinl.

In produciny this study a particular effort was made to

keep it objective and factual on the theory that in the case of sugar

the facts spenk for themselvos and need only to be pulled toyethor.

We also believo that objoctive material similar to the attached should

over a perlad of time enhance the reputation of the AMSCROLL economie

scction as a serious and objoctivo outfit that secks to discredit the

Castro regime by publicizing the truth.

2.

The Station would appreciate leadquarters' reaction to this

publication.

Additional copies

are available should distribution via

KMFORGET or othor means be desired.

It may be of interest to report that a copy of the attachod

report has been mailed to Identity, currently in Geneva where he de

represonting his company at the sugar conterence.

This was done

EUCAR, on September 6 concluded a sale of 5,000 tons of ran sugar for October 1965

delivery to the Irandan sugar organisation.

that it nas declared to have originated in the Caribbcan, including Peru, excluding

larket reports were correct in stating that the country of origin was in

The price agreed to was 18 pounds sterling per ton (C and F) Less 55-

shillings per ton to cover the expensos of the tender.

This deal was engineered by

Restzucker of Dortmund, an organisation also selling Cuban sugar to Jordan and which

wishes to keop its name out of those sales.

Another interesting development in Cuba's sugar selling activities during the month

of Soptember was quoting sugar for futuro delivery at or under the London spot

price on the day the offer was bade. In other words, Cuba is offering sugar under

the world market value.

It is difficult to explain this curious behavior in terms other than Cuba's despor

ate need for foreign exchange.

These salos at these prices can only result in a

net loss to Cuba due to Cuba's inefficient sugar production.

This loss will be cor

2. Free forld Shinning drops 51% - Twenty Western vessels called on fled Cuban ports

during the past month of August.

The trend continues downward; the August 1963

tal was 24,

and the one for August 1964 was 41, which means a decrease of 51%, when

August 1965 (20 vessels) is compared to August 1964.

These constructions are directed and supervised by Soviet technf

clans with the collaboration of Cuban

"slave work".

The Soviet Union

furnishes all the necessary equipment and machinery, in addition to

the above mentioned supervision and technical assistance: Cuba offers

the labor as well as the basic construction materials.

It was stipulated that the Soviet Union and Cuba would share in -

fishing terminal

which original cost was $12 million

out now it has

rinished by the beginning of 1966.

$30 millions and is expected to be -

Los rusos están construyendo muelles, diques secos, naves refrigeradas, plan

de comunicacionen y derás instalaciones necesirias para las operaciones

pesquera en la costa este del puerto de la Habana, conforme a

lo estipulado en el acuerdo Soviético-Cubano de Septiembro de 1962.

Estas construcciones se llevan a cabo bajo la dirección y supervisión de téc

nicos soviéticos, con la colaboración de "trabago esclavo" cubano. La Unión

Soviética facilita todos los equipos y raquinarias, además de la mencionada

supervisión y asistencia técnicas,

y Cuba pone la arena, pledras y materia

les básicos de construcción, aparte de la mano de obra.

Se habla

estipulado

que la Urdon soviética y Ciba usufructuasen a partet

igualos esta

terminal pesouera de vastas properciones, cuyo costo original

era de $12 millones de "pesos", pero que ya asciende a $30 millones y que se

espera estará terminada para principios de 1966.

Sin embargo, se ha podido conocer que debido a la cuantiosa suma que el régi

men Castro-Comuniste adeuda a la Unión Soviética,

los rusos han determinado

rue estas instalaciones serán para su uso exclusivo una vez terminadas.

la pesca será llevada a esta terrinal, procesada y exportada para la

Unión Soviética y buropa en mercantes rusos,

sir. que se derive provecho algu

no para Cuba y sin que los pesqueros cutanos puedan hacer uso de dichas ing

talaciones.

Esta área en la costa este del puerto de La Habana será cerrada en cuanto se

terminen las dratalaciones y sólo el personal sovsética tendrá accesa a esta

A• OPERATIONAL

During December there was considerable pressure on AMSCROLL

to join political

groupings being formed by ex-Presidents Urrutia

Fortunately,

AMSCROLL was able to stay out of both without

incurring the wrath of

either.

B. PRODUCTION

Although & number of new propaganda ideas were submitted by

AMSCROLL for approval,

actually printed during the month was the pony bulletin.

other items already on hand, including 5,000 Christmas cards, totallec

17, 000 pieces which were sent to 20,000 covers to Cuba. Another

10,000 items were distributed to Latin America and Spain, and 13,700

to addressees in the U. S.

Most of the two latter categorios were

based on requests from religious, social, and civic organizationg.

Samples of the items and a breakdown of the actual numbers of each

distributed are in the attached ANSCROLL Propaganda Section report.

Chief among the

themes, which also pervaded the two issues of the AMSCROLL house organ

published during the month and the above-mentioned pony bulletin for
