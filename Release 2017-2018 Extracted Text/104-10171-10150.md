sPairc- Report on Satellite nationals in the North German Area.

In 1945 the total suaber of refugees in lest Gernany amounted

to 10 millions

of people.

By 1953 this number had been reduced to

approximately 240,000, whore it has resined relatively otatio ever

Of this latter number, approximately 12,373 (or ca. 5% 0f

the total) were located in the Hambure area. As a group, they are

youthful and prolific. Approximately 138 are social cau.j, 50% are

active and employable adults, 8% are esployed by the occupation

authorities and over 25% are unemployad.

The overall percentage of non-German refugees among the native

population is .48%.

In Hanburg this fizure 1e .73% unile Schloswig-

It is interesting to compare

the figure 2204 with the total for Hamburg

refugee camps in Iable A, 2189,

and also with the figure in

2018 (17 February 1955) to show how statio these figures

are. (Table As

June 1952).

Also of intorest is ta fact that the ratio of these in

those outside is generally 583 (Table A), while zor Hamburg,

the ratio is closer to 115.

Table C for Niedersachsen is included to shor that the statiatics

for 1952 Given in Tablo A still apply.

The total in 1952 of non-fernan

refugees in Land Niedersachsen was 11,746.

The figure on 1 January 1955

was 11, 650, three years later.

7. To show why the German authorities tend to pay less attention

to the nor German refugees,

the figures for Geran refigees for land

Niedersachsen as of 1 Aurust 1953 are included in Table D. (See also

figures in 5 above..

. If one includes those Geraans receiving

for losses resulting from

the war,

then the figure is 142,186 in 1623 camps

as opposed to 11,746 in 28 camps for the lon-Gercans.

8. Thus and afforts should properly de directed at those agencies

prinarily concerned with the for-Ceran refugees.
