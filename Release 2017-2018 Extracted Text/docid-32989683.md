in Viet Man. LODICO stated that the segime

in Viet Nan, which is costing the Capitalists of the United

States millions of dollars, is not controlling the Buddhist

monks as well a the Imperialists of the United States would

The situation in Viet Nam

is getting out of hand and,

therefore, the President sent his representative to plead and

beg the vietnam to control the Bullhists more to the United

States liking.

Speaker LODICO said that the financing of this

unorganized regime is not by the people or by United

•Nations or by the President, but by only one man in the C.i.1.

He says that the people of the United States will

eventually

squawk about the tax dollars which are being spent.

American

Imperialism when a foreign

country wants to turn to Socialism.

Ile said America likes

its role in Vict Nan as it gives them a chance to try out

military weapons.

He said the only way for America to

stop playing its present stupid role is for America to

turn to Socialism.

He stated that the unions are some of the biggest

forces that protect discrimination against the Negro.

Capitalism is the thing that protects these

practices of discrinination against the Negro and this is

true in the unions that are dedicated supposedly to the pro

tection of the regro as a people.

The only way to end this

practice is to end its cause, and that is the Capitalistic

system.

regarding his speech as follows:

Gradually the Negro is coming out of his second

class citizenship standing and is taking his place among the

upper classes of society.

This struggle should serve to

prove that the laboring man can throw off the shackles of

oppression and demand of the leaders of labor the rightful

place of the working class in the affairs of the nation

and the world.

BREITHAN stated that Socialin is an ally of the

Negro in this struggle.

The program of true Socialism has

been in the forefront

of the fight for Negro rights ever

since this fight began. Socialisn refuses to stand for any

second class citizenship among all peoples. It recognizes

ROBERT ALLEL Centered his speech mainly around

the role that labor should be playing in the

giving of help to

the legro struggles in the North as vell as in the South.

The unions have a great amount of prejudice right in their

own ranks and should first of all clean house.

The whites

do have nuch to ada to this struggle and the record of che

Socialist "orkers Party is one os providing

this leadership

wherever and

whenever possible.

Responsibility for the plight

of the Negro in this present struggle rests with the white

man.

In concluding thurs said "the Negro is getting tired

of walting for freedom and wants freedom now. The legro of

today wants all regio organizations with Negro leaders to

bring about equality.

The Negio cannot hope to attain

their goals unless theirs becomes & revolutionary movement

and overthions the present system that made them slaves in the

first place".

NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO AID THE, BLOOMINGTON STUDENTS

The May 19, 1963, IsSue of "The Indianapolis Star"

, an

Indianapolis dally newspaper, contained an article relating

that

the committee to Aid the Bloomington Students (CABS) has been formed

as an outgrowth of the young socialist Alliance (YSA).

The article

related that the CABS was a fund raising unit dedicated to obtaining

funds for the defense of three YSA members indicted under Indiana's

1951 Anti- Subversive Law.

A source advised on September 23, 1963, that a YSA document

entitled "Tasks and Perspectives for the New York Local" (YSA) dis-

closed during Septembers

1963, that a National Committee to Ald the

Bloomington Students had been set up in New York City. This document

stated that the National CABS in New York City would coordinate and

direct the CABs activities throughout the country.

on February 11, 1964, a second source advised that the

primary purpose of the CABS, organized and controlled by the ySA:

was to raise funds for the legal defense of YSA members indicted

at Bloomington, Indiana.

source stated that the secondary purpose

of this committee was to propagandize the Bloomington defense and

utilize this case as an introduction to the aims of campus recruit

ment.

The second source further advised that the Socialist

Workers Party (SWP) exercises indirect control of the CABs through

control over the YSA leadership which operates the CABS. According

to this source; CABS work by SWe members, who are not YSA members,

Is considered as Party work and as a means of building the SWP.

t...

The April 13, 1964, issue of "The Milltant"

sup newspaper, bage 5, dIsclosed that on March 20, 1964, 490k1

indictments of the YSA members, mentioned above, were dismissed.

the article fursher relates that the National CABS, however, was

continuing to operate in regard to the solicitation of contribution.

to fight an appeal of the dismissal of indictments made by the

prosecution.

The National CABS maintains headquarters in the National

Headquarters of the YSA, 125 Fouth Avenue, New York CIty. The National

CABS maintains Post Office Box 213, Cooper Station, New York, New York

10003.

• The SWP has been designated pursuant to

W. E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DER)

A sovoc has advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a

conference of members of the communíst Party (CP), including

national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinoiss

for the purpose

of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national

Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most,

peaceful transition to socialism.

The delegates to this meeting were

cautioned against the germ of anti-soviet and anti-CP ideologies.

These delegates were also told that it would be reasonable to assume

the young socialists attracted into this new organization would

eventually pass into the CP itself.

A second conference of over 20 persons met in

on December 28-29, 1953, for the purpose a initiating a "calliso

to the new youth organization and planning for a founding convention

to be held in June, 1964.

A second source has advised that the founding convention

for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964, at

130 Golden Gate Avenue, san Exancisco, California, at which time the

name W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted. Approximately

500 delegates from throughout the United States attended this convention.

The aims of this organization, as set forth in the preamble to the

constitution, are, "It 1s our belief that this nation can best solve its

problems in an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence, complete disarmament

and true freedom for all peoples of the world, and that these solutions

will be reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic

elements in our country, composed essentially of the working people

allled in the unity of Negroes and other minorities with whites.

we

further fully recognize that the greatest threat to American

democracy comes from the racist and right wing forces in coalition

with the most reactionary sections of the economic power structure,

using the tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy the unified

struggle of the working people.

As young people in the forces struggling

for democracy, we shall actively strive to defeat these reactionary

neo-fascist elements and to achieve complete freedom and democracy

for all Americans, thus enabling each individual to freely choose and

build the society he would wish to live in. Through these struggles

le feel the American people will realize the viabillty of the socialist

alternative."

The constitution further states that this new organization

shall be a membership organization open to individuals: or lí fIve or

more people so desire, a chapter can be formed which shall in turn

be guided by the policies and principles of the parents organization.

Located at 954 i Actober 505 ten arted, a tea.

Over the Labor Day weekend, 1965, the DCA held a

conference in chicago, Illinois.

a new slate of national officers was elected at this conference,

which included Chairman HUGH STERLING FOWLER, II (who, according

to the third source, attended a CP cadre encampment held at Camp

Midvale, New Jersey, in June, 1965, and following his election as

Chairman of the DCA, attended another national CP cadre youth

Indiana, according to a fourth source);

Director of Publicity CARL

ELLENGER BLOICE (who was elected to the San Francisco County Committee

CP in April, 1904,

according

to a fifth source); Educational Director

MATTHEW "DYNAMITE" HALLINAN (who in June, 1964, was stated to be the

Youth Representative on the Northern California CP District Board,

according to a sixth surce); Organizational Secretary TERENCE "KAYO"

according to a seventh source, met in June, 1965,

with the District staft of the Illinois CP to discuss the proposed

FARRETI. DOBES gave the first of a two part lecture

on the subject

"Building the Revolutionary Party."

DOBBS

started his talk by saying that the sip has three goals of &

political nature; aligning the United States with world

socialien, defending

ths interest-of the exploited masses

against capitalism at home, and teaching and leading the

workers of the United States for the abolition of capitalism.

He spoke on reformism and stated that the SWP will oppose any

change in the political objectives and must be thoroughly

trained for combat.

He stated that a massive counter-revolutionary

war is being waged by the United States all over the world but

that they cannot continue to be the world's watchdog forever.

He stated that the world wide revolutionary movement has

sultered major setbacks in many areas, but at the same time an

indication of the imperialist downfall is the mass protest

of the war in Vietnam.

He stated that this is the first time

In the history of the

United States that any segment of the

population in numbers has protested the waging of war while

war is going on.

DOBBS stated that it is the need of the Party

to keep recruiting students into the swp and that as the Negroes

become more militant and more politically aware to recruit

them into the SWP.

In conclusion, DOBBS stated that the political

approach of the SHP is to

aim for

the conquest of power from the

capitalist class to a socialist form of government in the

United States by the working class.

During a discussion at the

conclusion of DOBBS' speach, NORMA LODICO asked DOBBS what he

meant when he said that the

struggle between capitalisn and

socialism would be a fierce struggle.

He replied that the

capitalist class in the United states would not give up easily

and would employ every tactic known to squelch the overthiow

of this system so consequently, as shown in the past history of

the United States it will be a fierce battle to overthrow

capitalism

in the United States

in order to substitute socialisn.

countrys they do not practice true socialism. NOVACK stated

that Russia played coalition politics with the Imperialist

countries since the second world war and to the present time

did everything in her power to oppose every colonial revolution

which took place since the second world war.

NOVACK stated that

this theory of coalition politics is in direct opposition to the

Trotsky theory of world revolution. He stated that the

which is following
