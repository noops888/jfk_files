MARINE recently visited Mexico "incognito"

and informed the POJAS that the situation now is extraordinarily

good but that TERESA was once under a death sentence because

she had dealt with LEE HARVEY OSWALD while assigned to the

Cuban Embassy prior to the assassination of JOHN F. KENNEDY.

Her friends interceded for her and her life was spared. ROJAS

The source stated that some years ago, as best he

telling a similar

story of how TERESA

PROENZA was somehow involved with LEE HARVEY OSWALD at the

Cuban Embassy.

At the time TERESA was employed at the embassy,

Within the

TERESA PRICENZA had been

arrested at her home and was being

held incommunicado.

CA review of the foregoing material indicates that

TERESA PROONZA got into trouble with the Cuban government more

as a result of her criticism of the handling of the OSWAL

matter following the assassination of President KENNEDY than

because of anything she did when OSWALD visited the Cuban

Embassy. Her harsh criticism of nigh Cuban officials (the

Ambassador and Foreign Minister) was apparently well known

in the embassy and hardly helped her case. *It fails to

indicate that she did anything for CSwAll that would substantiate,

the remarks made by JORGE CJAS and his wife toxiax 197Kthat

TERESA PROENZA had nearly been executed because of her activities

during OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Imbassy in 1983 In the

absence of additional information regarding this activity, no

further investigation is contemplatec at this time. It is

noted that it is not feasible to cirectly interrogate done:
