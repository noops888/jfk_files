Remarks (By SAC):

A great deal of

potential has been demonstrated by this informant

and information received on a dally basis is being utilized

continually by those Agents assigned to the Criminal Intelligence

Program in the Pittsburgh Office. Financial developments relating

to the North Star Cement Block Company assume prime importance

when it is realized that IA ROCCA has been designated as the prime

target subject of an intensification program looking toward early

prosecution on any Federal violation. LA ROCCA and the supervisory

employees of North Star have spoken freely enough for this informant

to ascertain their reactions to investigations being conducted by

both the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI at Pittsburgh. (See

supplemental page 3a)
