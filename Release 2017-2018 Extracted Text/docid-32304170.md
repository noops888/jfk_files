"The War Within" like Its predecessor "Spy Irial" and

newspaper articles of the trial is 190 pages of misstatements,

erroneous conclusions, fantasy, and the end result of the author's

overactive Imagination with in many instances no regard or rela-

The author has run the gauntlet of past espionage case

from RICHARD SORGE through FUCHS, ROSENBERGS; ABEL, etc., and as a

result thereof the FBI is frequently mentioned. Outside of refer-

author's unfamiliarity with our responsibilities

only apparently critical reference is on page 106.

SYNOPSIS:

written by Comer Clarke, Britisa author,

Lonsdale and Cohen cases. Bufiles negative on Clarke.

By letter 6/12/61 Legat, London, furnished a copy of

"The War Within."

A review of the book reveals It is full of

inaccuracies, erroneous assumptions, and conclusions and other

items which are outright lies.

He mentions the FBI in one place

in a derogatory fashion.

The author claims we had seen Morris and

Lona Cohen meeting with Colonel Rudolf Abel and had investigated

'Abel but Abel's cover was so good we decided he had no espionage

the author states

and has absolutely no basis in fact.

It is an obvious attempt

to shift the blame to the FBI for the fact that the Cohens

operated in England for over six years without being detected.

This book appears to be thrown together hastily in an

effort to profit from a timely book. It apparently relies heavily

n british newspaper accounts which were very inaccurate and prove

distruthful under an active analysis.

This is not correct. Fuchs' name and

British address were in Halperin's notebook.

page 51

The author claims that Fuchs came to the

United States in 1946 and asked fellow scientists about the

duties of a communist scientist which was reported to the

FBI.

Then the FBI watched Fuchs and reported to MI-5 that

Fuchs had been seen meeting Soviet agents.

[5]

Fuchs frof Bureau Source information sola the British, who

•We identilled

interrogated Fuchs, and he confessed. (5)

page 52

The author claims the FBI followed the Cohens

after the arrest of the Rosenbergs.

The author claims the

FBI found out that the Cohens were friends of the Rosenbergs.

This is false.

page 53

The author states Lona Cohen was co-director

of "Save the Rosenbergs"

campaign.

This is false.

pages 54-55. The author tells of Lonsdale's training in

Winnitsa which is allegedly the town in Russia which is set

up like an American town.

We have received reports of the existence of this

town, however, it has never been proven.

page 55

The claim is made that an FBI source in the

United States stated Lonsdale was trained in this town.

This is a lie.

page 61

Contains a fanciful description of Lonsdale

meeting the Cohens in Tokyo in 1954 on their way to Canada.

This has no basis in fact.

This is completely false.

It was only after the

arrest when the fingerprints of the Krogers were compared with

the fingerprints of the Cohens which we had furnished to the

British earlier that an identification was made•j(5)

page 149

The author states that a locket found in the

shop of Cohens contained a microdot which was a newspaper

article concerning the Abel case.

Again this is wrong.

A locket was found,

however, it contained photographs and no microdots.
