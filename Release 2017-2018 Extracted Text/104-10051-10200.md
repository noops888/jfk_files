SMABLE would appreciate receiving

information you may have on two Soviet Officials at present

serving in Finland. They are:

GIPACOMOVICHG. E.

COLUB - Soviet Consul

- I. MAKHEV

- Correspondent for

Milalai: Tractioned Mit.

Both officials have been in social contact with members of _the

SHADE Legation in Helsinki.

This contact instigated by GOLUB

was allegedly

to inquire about SMADD immigration procedure.

MAKEEV acüed as his

interpreter throughout the meeting.

SMABLE has a trace in their files referring to G. E.

GOLUB as Soviet Intelligence Officer acting as liaison man

with the Finnish Security Police®

There seems furthermore to be

a similarity here with

the activities of Boris Lupovich TRETYAKOV (TRETIAKOU) Head

of the USSR Consular Section in Athens who has been conducting

similar inquiries with the MADDs there.
