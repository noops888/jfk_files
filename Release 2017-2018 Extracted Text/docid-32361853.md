Dear Mr. Rust:

Re: U.S..v. Gerald Patrick Hemming

So. Dist. Fla. Case No. 76-6085-Cr-JE

This letter is in response to your letter to the Director, dated.

January 19, 1977, requesting information pursuant to Brady v. Maryland

concerning Mr. Gerald Patrick Hemming's alleged employment with

this Agency.

Mr. Hemming has been a voluntary informant for this Agency,

having, on several occasions, voluntarily provided information to the

Agency. An acknowledgment to this effect was provided the Depart-

ment of Justice by this Agency's General Counsel in a letter dated

February 15, 1965.

Our records do not reflect that Gerald Patrick Hemming was ever

employed by the Central Intelligence Agency in any capacity, or that he

was ever used as an agent or in similar capacity. Mr. Hemming did

submit an application for employment with the Agency in January 1962.

He was informed in June 1962 that there were no positions available. for

him within the Agency.
