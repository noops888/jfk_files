Cubela has been President of the Cuban University

Student Federation (FEU) for many years and was also a leader of

the Revolutionary Directorate, a group which fought with Castro

to overthrow •batista.

For several months we have been receiving

reports that Cubela is fed up with Castro and wants to defect.

Since the data developed by Miami inúicates

defection, we are withholding dissemination
