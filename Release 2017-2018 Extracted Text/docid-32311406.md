very concerned over the assassination of President KENNEDY

the involvement of OSWALD, who was connected with the

Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCG) .

Although she did not

indicate which organism of the PM had reached this decision,

1t is to be noted that MORA was a member of the so-called

Leadership Branch of the POM.

She stated that the PCM had

decided that there

might possibly be involved in FPCC operations as far as

the Mexican police might know:

ASA ZATZ (Bufile 105-16890),

CHARLES SMALL, and the informants.

As the Bureau 18 aware,

the informants came to the

attention of the vexican authorities when FEUN LEVS TRAVIS

(Bufile 100-336032), who was admittedly a member of the FPCC,

was arrested and deported in November, 1962.

At that time,

the Nexican police found the informants! home address and

telephone number in TRAVIS! motel room and it was necessary

for the intormants to go into niding until the Mexican police

gave up efforts to interview them. & le)

on 11/23/63, MORA advised the informants that if

arrested for political reasons. aus

under the above circunstances,

therefore; any

request of the Mexican police to interview SMALL on the basis

of his relations with members of the FPCC would focus the

attention of those authorities orkvnx-18 and vEX-19k as well KLu]

as on SMALL, wich the possibility that the Mexican police,

who, as pointed out above, are difficult to control, might

also take action against the intormants.

Consideration has also been given to calling SMALL,

who is an American citizen, Into the Embassy for interview.

It is not felt, however, that such action would be advisable

since any interrogation by Embassy personnel, including this

office, would necessarily have to be predicated on informa-

tion from*uex-18 and NEX-19 which would jeopardize the

LIUT

informants the same as if done by the Mexican police. &

The informants have also advised that SMAIl has

the Mexico City

office has no information to show that such an interview,

either by the Mexican police or the American officers would

be productive.

Available sources have given no indication

that SMALL actually ever knew or saw OSWALD.

His claim that

he must have known OSWALD at

sone time and that he might

have met OSWALD in Mexico was, according to Mex-18 and Max-19 0(u)

based on the fact that many Americán communists visiting

Mexico go to SNAIL's store and that he assists them in con-

nection with their problems while visiting Mexico City, d

SMALL, however, has given no indication that he

recognized OSWALD from the newspaper pictures printed in

Mexico City or recognized his name as being one of the

visitors at his store.

The informants have reported that

following the assassination of President KENNEDY and the

publie identification of OSWALD's leftist connections with

the FPCC and his former residence in the Soviet Union, the

American communists in Mexico were extremely fearful, expect-

ing police harrassment of all leftists.

They considered

SMALL's concern over the possibility that OSWALD might have

visited his store to be part of the general concern of all

American communists here after reading that OSWALD had been

in Mexico.

No information has since been developed to

contrary.

In light of

the above,

the Mexico City Office does

not belteve

that an interview of SMATt should be undertaken

by either Mexican of American officials.
