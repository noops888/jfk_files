Hode NAsSlideo roscarch project mentioned in reference a prare

In the opinion of

station to be one which should stand on its

own feet and not be supported solely because it is one of particular

Interest to the gDPIRe aad cotta out by subject for them.

2. When Hede MASSING was in

she mentioned to (SYPATHIZIR/11)

that she could approach people in

Jas in any other country in

Europe more gracefully if she had some' sort of cover in which to cloak

her real interest. In the context of this discussion, she said, as d-

scribed in paragraph I of reference, that she once was going to conduct

research together with her husband into the motivation which prompted

the defection of approximately 100 Conmunists who may or may not have

made public their break from Communist or Soviet espionage. She stated

that this projact collapsed because the organization which was about to

support it itself collapsed before she could get launched. She oited

be done only if KUBIRK feels that the project in itself is of merit as

a propaganda vehicle and as a means of contacting this type of person to

set their full story in other places as well as

would certainly benefit from it in the manner above described but did not at

all anticipate that so extensive a project would be undertaken solely

because they have a somewhat limited interest in 1to

No will diycuss this matter wit. Lavell and MASSING when they

arrive in Holland on or about 24 September 1958.
