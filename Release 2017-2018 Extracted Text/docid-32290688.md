Information furnished by GALVEZ on January 7, 1961

regarding EDWARD MARUSA and Dr. MARGUERITE KRAUSZ attempting

to purchase $135,000 worth of light machine guns and rites

in the United States for shipment to one Dr. JIMENEZ in

Honduras, was telephonically furnished to U. S. Customs,

Miami on January 7, 1961, and was confirmed by letter dated

January 10, 1961.

Since the above identified matters dealt with

matters

customs, communications were not directed to the Bureau.

It is noted, however, that the EDWARD BROWDER,

referred to above, is the subject of Bureau file 87-54333.

10 and August 11, 1961 by SA WILLIAM P. KELLY reflect the

following regarding information disseminated to that agency,

as supplied by GALVEZ:

JEAN WILCHESTER, Customs Agent, advised that agency

was unable to evaluate the information furnished regarding RAUL

GONZALEZ, and that no customs Investigation had been conducted

in that matter.:

on August 14, 1961 U. S. Customs Agent BERNARD

GALLAGHER, Miami,

advised SA KELLY that information furnished

to Customs regarding GEORGE WILLIAM BORDEN is probably

reliable. GALLAGHER stated U. S. Customs received the same

information regarding BORDEN from two additional sources, who

were in a position to know the facts.

GALLAGHER stated that

BORDEN 1S

still under active U. S. Customs investigation.

On August 31, 1960, GALVEZ BARNES furnished infor-

mation to the Miami Office concerning information he received

from one ARMANDO PINTO, a Honduran,

Living at Miami Beach,

Florida.

PINTO reportedly advised GALVEZ BARNES on August

31, 1960, a Cuban named RAUL GONZALEZ, who is reported to

working in the United States as an agent for the Honduras

Government, with the purpose of negotiating arms purchases

for the Honduras Government, was reported to have a check

for $75,000, drawn on the Banco Central of Honduras, which

check was to be used to buy arms.

GALVEZ BARNES stated that

GONZALEZ was reported to be in Washington, D. C., at an un-

known address.

GONZALEZ was further reported by PINTO to

have purchased ammunition for the Honduras Government at

New Orleans, on an unknown date, which ammunition was re-

portedly shipped to Honduras.

This information was promptly

furnished to United States Customs, Miami.

On November 18, 1960, GALVEZ advised that he had

been contacted by one GEORGE WILLIAM BORDEN, a reported

Honduran resident alien in the u.s.

• GALVEZ reported that

BORDEN was making contacts in the Miami, Florida area in

an attempt to negotiate a sale to the Honduran Government,

for $650,000 of a dismantled Thompson submachine gun factory,

which was reported to be somewhere in New York, New York.

GALVEZ reported further that BORDEN stated he had a quantity

of undescribed Thompson submachine gun spare parts for sale

to the Honduran Government.

On December 9, 1960, GALVEZ

advised that students

at the University of Honduras

held a "Fidelista Week"

(pro-

CASTRO celebration) at that University in late November.

1960.

He further identified the "Communist" newspaper in

Tegucigalpa, Honduras as "El Cronista"

GALVEZ further advised

on

December 9, 1960, that

the Honduran Minister of Foreign Affairs, ANDRES ALVARADO

PUERTO, a former officer in the Caribbean Legion, is out-

spoken in his support of FIDEL CASTRO and has expressed him-

self as being anti-U. S.

on January 71201 GALVEZ advised he had re-

ceived information that one EDWARD MARUSA and his wife,

Dr. MARGUERITE KRAUstboth of Miami, were reportedly at-

tempting to purchase $135,000 worth of light machine guns

and rifles in the U. S. for shipment to one Dr. JIMENEZ in

Honduras.

On March 13, 1961, GALVEZ reported that the Hon-

duran Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) is apparently well armed

and appears to exist only to counteract the Honduran Army.

He stated that the Guardia Civil is believed to be heavily

infiltrated with Honduran Communists.

GALVEZ further advised on March 13, 1961, that

according to reports of the Government of El Salvador,

twelve unidentified Cuban citizens were arrested while

entering El Salvador with Honduras passports showing the

Cubans to be Honduran citizens. C

On March 13, 1961, GALVEZ advised that the Hon-

duras Government, headed by

President RAMON VILLEDA MORALES

is not actively opposing either the Communists or pro-

CASTRO elements in Honduras.

GALVEZ also reported on March 13, 1961, that the

Communist Party of Honduras was then acting openly in that

country to the extent that members were signing their names

to newspaper articles and other literature authored by the

Communist Party of Honduras.

He stated he had information

that as late as early, March, 1961, the Communist Party of

Honduras held its meetings within

"stone's throw" of the

presidential palace in Tegucigalpa and advised that the

Liberal Party,

which is currently in power, is split into

some five factions, only one of which is controlled by.

President VILLEDA MORALES.

SECKE

On April 17, 1961, GALVEZ advised that the Com-

in Tegucigalpa were planning a large demonstration

for May Day (May 1, 1961), which was to be countered by

anti-communist elements.

On May 19, 1961, GALVEZ furnished information

that one

ESPERANZA GARAY,

a stewardess for TAN Airlines,

may have

been engaged in smuggling small arms (•38 caliber

pistols) from Miami to Central America.

On July 17, 1961, GALVEZ stated that FEDERICO

DANIEL MONTES, an anti-communist student leader at the

University of

Honduras, recently announced that he would

seek re-election within that group. GALVEZ stated that

MONTES was shot at by unknown person or persons upon

leaving the meeting at which he declared his intention to

seek re-election.

GALVEZ stated the Communists were be

lieved responsible for the incident. He described MONTES

as his brother-in-law.

Since GALVEZ has various contacts, both in the

United States and in Central America, who are in a position

to furnish GALVEZ information of interest to the Bureau

and other U. S

Government Agencies, such as the

- Depart-

ment of State, (Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and DU)

Jo s. customs,

and since a friendly, cordial relationship

has been developed with GALVEZ by the Miami Office,

it 1s

expected that he will continue to cooperate in furnishing

information of interest.

No payments have been made to GALVEZ, and none

are anticipated.

3. GALVEZ is being considered as a Confidential Source

of the Miami Office in Honduran Matters. He has been ad-

vised

that he is not a Bureau employee. He had been ad-

vised also of the confidential relationship which must

exist between himself and contacting agents.

The Miami

Office will be alert to be certain that GALVEZ is not a

plant. GALVEZ is not connected with a labor union.
