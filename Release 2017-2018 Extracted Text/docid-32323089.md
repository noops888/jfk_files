On January 30, 1960, DL-6-S, in person, furnished a

handwritten report to SA W. HARLAN BROWN, which report is

dated 1/28/61, and serialized as 134-1A-570.

That report reflected that on Saturday, 1/28/61, MRS.

ELMORE

advised JOE LANDIN that the meeting (Forum) had

been

postponed because of the weather.

On Sunday night, 1/29/61, ALBERT OROZCO telephoned JOE

LANDIN and informed him that the meeting of the Forum would

take place on Monday, 1/30/61. OROZCO, the Forum's Chairman,

explained to LANDIN that they

were about to organize a Junior

Forum and asked LANDIN to bring with him printed matter dealing

with racial discrimination.

He specified the article dealing

with the Daughters of the American Revolution. LANDIN said he

would comply, and asked OROZCO what kind of propaganda was the

Forum giving to its coming scholarship dance.

OROZCO said they

had 10 or 12 spots on the radio.

LANDIN suggested the Forun

write a letter and put it up at

Stone's barber shop, et cetera.

OROZCO liked the idea and asked JOE LANDIN to draw up an

example. JOE said he would.

Informant had no additional information.
