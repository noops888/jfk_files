MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Comments on George de Mohrenschildt (201-155221)

1. According to the Warren Commission Report, page 283,

...

George de Mohrenschildt is a highly individualistic

person of varied interests.

He was born in (Mozyr) in the

Russian Ukraine in (17 April) 1911 and fled Russia with his

parents in 1921 during the civil disorder following the

revolution. He was in a Polish cavalry military academy for

1 1/2 years. Later he studied in Antwerp and attended the

University of Liege from which he received a doctor's degree

in international

commerce in 1928.

Soon thereafter, he emi-

grated to the United

States; he became a U.S. citizen in 1949.

De Mohrenschildt

eventually became interested in oil explora-

tion and production; he entered the University of Texas in

1944 and received

a master's degree in petroleum geology and

petroleum engineering in 1945.

He has since become active

as a petroleum engineer throughout the world. In 1900, after

the death of his son, he and his wife made an 8-month hike

from the United States-Mexican border to Panama over primitive

jungle trails. By happenstance they were in Guatemala City

at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion.

A lengthy film and

complete written log was prepared by de Mohrenschildt and a

report of the trip was made to the U.S. Government. Upon

arriving in Panama they journeyed to Haiti where de Mohren-

schildt eventually became involved in a Government-oriented

business venture in which he has been engaged continuously

since June 1963 . ...".

2.

Somewhat of a non-conformist, de Mohrenschildt was a

peripheral member of the so-called Russian community, in Dallas,

with which Lee Harvey Oswald made contact through Peter Gregory,

a Russian-speaking petroleum engineer whom Oswald met as a

result of his contact with the Texas Employment Commission

office in Fort Worth.

Occasional contacts with de Mohrenschildt

and his wife continued until May 1963. when the de Mohrenschildt's

went to Haiti.

3.

There is voluminous material on de Mohrenschildt in

CIA files, most of it dating from the post-Kennedy assassi-

nation period when he testified before the Warren Commission

on his acquaintance with Lee Harvey Oswald and the latter's

wife.

The testimony given by de Mohrenschildt and his wife

appear in Volume IX of the Hearings before the President's

Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, pages

166 - 331.

4. The bulk of the material in Agency files consists

of FBI reports, the most recent of which is dated 1967.

The

FBI has informed CIA that it has no traces on de Mohrenschildt-

beyond that date. (Memorandum no. 76-3000 from the IG to the

Director, 22 September 1976.)

5.

addressed to de Mohrenschildt, c/o the United States Embassy:

The results of the operations were shared with the FBI.

(Memorandum no. 76-3000 cited above.)

(The genesis of this

mail operation is not readily available. A search is being

made to find it.)

6.

The most recent information relating to de Mohren-

schildt is correspondence dated 5 September 1976 from him to

the Director, George Bush.

De Mohrenschildt claims that he

something "to remove this net around us."

7.

According to a note from the Director, he had first

met de Mohrenschildt in the early 40's.

"He was an uncle to

my Andover roommate".

The Director has not heard from him

for many years until the letter arrived. The Director res-

ponded to de Mohrenschildt's letter on 28 September 1976.

(A copy of this material is attached as an enclosure to

Memorandum no. 76-3000 from the IG under Tab A.)

8. Earlier in 1976, the Agency received information

from Mr. J. Walton Moore

who had been contacted in May and

July 1976 by writers connected with the Reader's Digest,

and with the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company.

Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and Mr. de

Mohrenschildt. (Moore's reports on these contacts are

attached to the IG Memorandum.)

9.

De Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous

and colorful life as a petroleum

renschild:

engineer

and businessman.

He is both well and poorly connected, and

some of his

associations have raised serious questions.

(see paragraph

10 below.) Certainly his relationship with the Oswald's

has caused this Agency and the FBI to spend more time and

energy on him in the past than was necessary:

Both the FBI

and this Agency,

however, had dropped their interests in

de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late 1960's.

10. One of de Mohrenschildt's more questionable:

contacts (not covered in his 201 file) has been reported in

the

Washington Post and the Washington Star.

According to

the 31 March 1977 issue of the. Star, Willem Oltmans, a Dutch

journalist, began cultivating de Mohrenschildt as a news

source

and

as

a friend some ten years ago.:' According to

Jitmans' file he was born on 10 June 1925 in Huizen,

Holland.

le studied at Yale in 1950 and was expelled for misbehavior

(financial problems ?). For a short time he worked for the

United Press and De Telegraft a Dutch newspaper; however, he

was fired from both.

• In 1956 or 1957 he married

ground stewardess.

In 1960 he divorced her and in November

1961 was living with a Filipino male. Oltmans was admitted

to the United

States in New York City as a permanent resident

on 10 June 1958.

Numerous field reports indicate that in 1956

Oltmans arranged an introduction for himself to President

Sukarno.

then traveled with Sukarno during the President's

trip through Europe in 1956 as the President's

guest.

trip from Indonesia to the US in Feb 57 was paid by the

Indonesian government.

Indications are that he was being used

as a tool by the Indonesian government to carry on propaganda

in the US and at the UN.

b. In March 1960 Oltmans described himself as anti-

communist. He stated his views are at best those of a great

admirer of communism and what the communist system represents.

He was

described as having excellent contacts with all the

communist-dominated countries, including Cuba.

According to press

reports, on 18 December 1962

Oltmans announced he intended to take legal action against

Dutch Foreign Minister J. M. A. H. Luns.

Oltmans alleged

that he had been refused "on instructions from Luns" a declara-

tion by the Dutch Embassy in Washington, D. C., that he was

a bona fide journalist working for bona

fide newspapers. An

early 1972 report stated Oltmans was attempting to have
