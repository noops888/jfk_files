REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MYSAGE-I KNOWS THE TRUVIDENTITY OF

TRUE. THE PERSON IN QUESTION COULD JUST AS EASILY

HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE BRAVO GROUP IN LATE GOS.

MIAMI'S RECORDS OF SABOTAGE OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA

PRIOR TO 1968 ARE INCOMPLETE. CARACAS, THEREFORE,

MAY BE ABLE TO ISOLATE TWO OR THREE PERSONS WHO

FIT THIS GENERAL CRITERIA FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

D. HYSAGE-1 ALLEGES THAT QUESADA WAS IN NEW

YORK CITY AREA AND MET WITH HER DURING THE WEEK OF

13 SEPTEMBER IF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED, IT MIGHT

ELIMINATE ROGELIO RODRIGUEZ (DEPENDING UPON HIS

PRESENT WHEREABOUTS) AS A PRIME CANDIDATE.

FOR HEADQUARTERS: STATION MIAMI WOULD APPRECIATE
