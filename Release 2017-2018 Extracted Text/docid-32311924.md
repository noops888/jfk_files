Enclosed letterhead memorandum has been classified

"Confidential" because it contains information from the

above current sources of the FBI. It is felt the un-

authorized disclosure of information attributed to these

sources could compromise these sources and thus be

injurious to the national defense.

Two coples of this communication are being

forwarded to the Dallas

Division in view of their

interest in this matter.

For the information of the Bureau,

subject's

lecture series entitled

"Who Killed Kennedy?" starting

8/25/64, will be covered in a future letterhead

memorandum.

The pretext on 8/11/64, was conducted by

SA RONALD E. YOUNG of the Citizens' Committee of

Inquiry, 156 5th Avenue, NYC, under the guise of being

a person

interested in attending a LANE lecture.

Investigation continuing at New York.
