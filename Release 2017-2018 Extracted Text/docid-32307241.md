MEYEB-LANSKY, well known U.S. hoodlum, is planning on setting up a large

operation in Cuba, exact nature of which 1s as yet unknown to informant.

He said he had been told that the locally well known law firm of NESTOR

Apart and unconnected with the above, source advised on the same

date that he had recently been told by a person he considers reliable that

NORMAN ROTHAN, FBI No. 152585B,

had offered this person $200,000 of

counterfelt U. S. currency at 12J of the face value. Source said the

person told him that he was not having anything to do with the operation.

It is believed entirely possible that ROTHMAN may be making

this offer. He is known to have been forced to close the Sans Souci

night club and gambling casino, which he had been operating in Havana,

due to lack of money.

Information has been received that he has a number

of debts in Havana and ROHAN himself bas

that he hardly has "bread money" anymore.

Source recalled that thee or four years ago MCKINDAVIS, Wasa,

FBI No. 1159304, had offered the source a similar quantity of counterfeit

money and he believes that this may be the same money which ROTHAN is

trying to push. DAVIS was at that time connected with ROTHAN in the

Sans Souci as a shill and steerer.
