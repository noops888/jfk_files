Please refute the following: l) American aid is dangerous

because it is conditional. Pleáse read His Royal Highness' articles

published in the Nationalist [Nyeak Cheat Niyum] on 1 and 8 December

1963. American-Cambodian relations have déteriórated because of

the injustice of the American Administration, aggravated by; the

accusation against Cambodia following the death of president KENNEDY

and by the American refusal to guarantee Cambodian neutrality and

integrity..?) The closing of the Cambodian Embassy in London is not

a political measure but an economic one.

Relations

will continue and the British Ambassador in Phnom Penh

has been so informed.
