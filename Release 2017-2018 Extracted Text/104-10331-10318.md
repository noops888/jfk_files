Notes from Briefing of ARRB Staff on Stations

(11 October 1995 - ARRB conf. room)

CIA Attendees:

Bill re Stations:

No problem with release of COS, fact we have overseas

locations, CIA representatives

in specific countries -- the

problem comes with officially acknowledging the stations

thereby putting the host government and service in a

position of explaining why it is allowing a foreign

espionage unit to operate in the country. This may become a

serious political issue for the government, especially in

countries where the government does not acknowledge its own

service.. Also can be perceived as "rubbing their nose in

it" and can effect the trust between the Agency and the host

service (violated agreement of confidentially).

Marwell pointed out that this information was 30 years old

and ask what was the impact of acknowledging a station

presence in 1963 on current operations or relations.

B111

responded "opened up old sores" and cited and the

sensitivity to our involvement in past election.

Mentioned

the reaction to the announcement on covert actions by DCI.

Gunn ask if stations = liaison relationship; Bill said the

other service can not say it did not know the CIA was

operation in its own country -- would look incompetent.

Mary ask about changes in governmentiaBill responded that

gooded types tend to stay on or its revolving door

where a

will be back in power at some point.

Bill comments on specific stations

It important to the story such as

and the

surrounding stations which were involved in the cable

exchanges re Oswald, then will release.

"Don't take it away from us for little or no gain to the

story", I. e. if not critical to the story let us protect.

He indicated he could live with opening the stations for

short windows if important to story, but also said it

created a problem about protecting other activities in that

window

Moscow - opened for Oswald windows

- No, past elections issue and current narcotics

projects

No, counter narcotics projects

J- Liaison relationships have been up and down; (PNGed

five officers) can't afford any more flaps

- long time relationship w/ head of state; could give

anti-government labor unions an issue (however, would

not "fall on my sword" for this one:

-- would go to DCI with request to

appeal

(governments currently under fire for cooperation

with US/very sensitive operation under way

Marwell ask about substitute language: Scandinavia, Northern

Europe

-- Bill responded with

Western Europe/ said

Europe

"Ok".

southern

do not want to acknowledge but could live with

- very sensitive

- is open in 1955; 1963 (?) Bill may have been having

second

thoughts about previous statement "to release", but I

think it still stands

-- there was a discussion of why

important to story.

Mary ask about other European

stations,

South American stations

and some

Bill did not have specific on other stations but made a

couple of comments

- no problem

- very sensitive to any mention of intelligence

service presence

Would get back to them on other stations

[I promised Bill a list of the Stations]

Other issues discussed

Crypts other than LIs and AMs - there was a discussion re

deleting digraph and letting rest of crypt; everyone seemed

receptive, but no decision.

Bill mentioned Iranian takeover as good example of damage

caused by release of documents with crypts, file #s, etc.

Gunn ask if there was an internal "damage"

study prepared.

Bill said he would check.

Marwell rejected the approach of the Agency having the

opportunity to discuss Board actions before official

notification. If we have evidence, need to present upfront,

not come back with additional evidence after the decision.

The balancing of public interest vs Agency needs came up

several times; Marwell commented that even if a document or

item is not important to the Oswald story, the Agency must

still defend.

Bill stated several timed during the meeting "If important

to the story, we can live with release".
