Title: John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis:

The Act established the Assassination Records Review

Board (ARRB) to oversee the governments' production and

compliance with the Act.

The ARRB reviews the proposed

postponements in documents sent by each agency to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and decides what

postponements

the Act allows or opens the document in full.

ARRB's responsibilities include having agencies search other

The

subjects and areas to find additional material not already

identified as assassination records.

The establishment of the

ARRB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be

The ARRB must complete their tasks by September

1998.

With this deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter

requesting additional information.

GRF-96-1021205-3532

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material.

Details:

On July 9, 1997, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBI

setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional

records. The ARRB's goal is to research every possible subject

that may have a bearina on assassination theories and to assure

Congress

and the American public that all was done to accomplish

the intentions of the Act.

New York should conduct

a search for the listed items.

If New York is aware of any administrative records they may have

maintained outside the normal

index system, they should include

those areas in the search. If

any documents related to this

matter are found, please forward the documents to the JFK Task

Force.

Pursuant to the Act, any material categorized

assassination record must be

sent to the NARA in its original

form. The Act established the process of handling the documents

and the FBI must follow the Act. If your office believes they

need a

copy, you should copy the documents or material before
