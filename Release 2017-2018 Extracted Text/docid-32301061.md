According to information provided by the informant, the vessel

is scheduled to depart in the immediate future, possibly under

the command of Paneque. Bosch has also reportedly acquired

a radio transmitter and receiver which operates on 4895

kilocycles, which is allegedly located at his residence at

4138 Southwest 16th Terrace. All of the above-mentioned

radio equipment operates on the same frequency.

Several sources consider Paneque suspicious because

of unverified rumors circulating in the Miami area to the

effect that he is a Castro agent.

Paneque was interviewed on

October 12, 1960.

He claimed to be anti-Castro and anticommunist

and that he came to the United States for the purpose of

organizing and soliciting aid for the captioned organization.

He claimed that he had recently visited the Pentagon in

Washington, D. C., where he contacted two unidentified

individuals in the Department of the Navy relative to a plan

for aiding anti-Castro forces in Cuba.

Paneque stated he had

served as Chief of Public Order, G-3, Cuban Any, from July,

1959, to Septembez 1, 1960, when he stole a boat and left

Cuba.

The foregoing infornation is being made available

to United States Customs and United States Border Patrol

in the Miani axea.
