this shift; 4:00 p.m. to Midnight, Sunday through Saturday,

one SE; for a total of 20 eight-hour shifts, equaling 160 hours

of coverage.

The 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shift on Sunday is not

covered due

Five SEs, based on a 40 hour week, provide 200 hours

of coverage, noting that two SEs are normally assigned Monday

through Friday on the 8:15 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. shift, it being

noted these are the more productive hours

for the sources

afford required coverage.

As of June, 1961, Chicago had six SEs assigned.
