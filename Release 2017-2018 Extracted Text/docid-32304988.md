The following information from NY 694-5* was not

Included in the enclosed IHM because by its nature:

It tends to identify NY 694-S*, a highly placed Informant.

While In Prague, CSR, in the period February 16-18,

1960, NY 694-s* conversed with CHAO YI MIN, a member of

the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party•

MIN told NY 694-5* that the Chinese Communist Party hađ

requested that he locate PHILIP KEENEY and his wife,

MARY JANE KEENEY, and advise them that the Chinese

Communist Party

desires them to go to China to live and

to work.

Their travelling expenses will be paid for

by the Chinese, and at that time there were airplane

tickets waiting for them at Bern, Switzerland.

An information copy is being furnished the

San Francisco Office because of their interest in

JULIAN SCHUMAN.
