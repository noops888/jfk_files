and occasionally other Far East countries.

The subject

does not handle any information in the course of his normal

duties that would be of interest

to the Israeli Government,

either from an intelligence of economic point of view. (S)

It was ascertained that the business of the bank

does not deal with any information which would be classified

because of a national security interest.

It was learned

that certain information is administratively controlled

and available only to staff members of the bank. : It was

explained, however, that the administratively controlled

material is available to the general public through various

other sources.

The bank restricts

its information

only because of a desire to release the information at a

particular time.

The subject would have access to the

files throughout the various departments of the bank but

would have no cause to utilize these files in his position. (S

On July 14, 1958, the Office of Security was

advised that a thorough search of all records of the various

departments of the bank failed to disclose that DAJANY had

withdrawn any files outside of the normal course of his

DAJANY

still had many friends.

DAJANY described ROUSAN as being

the same caliber as many of his acquaintances, but felt ROUSAN

was even superior because ROUSAN was bold and

courageous.

DAJANY advised he would foresake whatever wealth and position

he might have at some future time and would look forward to

someone like ROUSAN with whom he could co-operate and work

ald over again in the interest of Jordan.S

"and unbecoming of a high official of your caliber; reflect,

nevertheless, a personal sentiment of animosity on your

part which surprised me very much. (s)

"If I remember correctly, you and I were friends

at one time. I had esteemed you and your capabilities and

have with me a letter from you, written to me soon after

the death of your father, in which you expressed a reciprocation

of this feeling of esteem. In 1951 I was appointed to

our Embassy in Washington and I departed to the United States.

There was no further contact between us until a certain

episode In 1953•(S)

"I doubt if until today you are aware of how

much harm you have caused me when I was with the Embassy.

I do not claim you did so intentionally. In all

probability you did not but I have, nevertheless, paid very

dearly for something I have not done.

My superior at that

time, Dr. Haikal, knew that I was completely

innocent

and a victim of false and untrue allegations.

The Government as well investigated the whole falacy and

acquitted me completely. Inspite of this I did not escape

the unfortunate effects of such 11l and unfounded accusations. (S)

"It took a long long time

for me to heal from the

effects of those hastily made and Irresponsible allegations:

Ofcourse, deep down I was always and still am very proud

of everything I did because I had done nothing wrongsin,

during, or outside my duties. My past and record in

nationalism and in the love of my Country are known to all

those who knew me and I doubt now very much if you really

ever knew me. (5)

"I had not approached you on the subject then

because I felt you too were doing your duty, and

as long

as the Government acquitted me, and as long as I had a

clear conscience, I had nothing to reproach you about. I

honestly did not

suspect for a moment that there was

any personal motivation on your part involved. (5)

They both suggested that

WASH.DIC

I let by-gones be by-gones and they promised to talk to you

upon your return and request you to stop your unprovoked

and uncalled for attitude. Upon my return to Washington

I learnt of what you had said here and again I decided to let

1t go.

"However, when you go to the extent of writing

officially to Mr. Shoalb that the Bank staff does not

include a Jordan citizen I feel I should rectify your

statement which can only imply that I am not a Jordan

citizen. As an Under Secretary, I am confident you will

want your statements to be correct and to this end wish to

inform you that I am, have been, and always will be a

Jordan citizen; very proud of my country, my religion and

my nationality. There are still certain things on earth

that no one can take from an individual, and those feelings

Hamad, I assure you, no one can take from me. My Jordan

passport 1s a valid genuine passport.

I was

born in

Jerusalem and am the proud member of the largest family

in Jordan. To Imply or claim that I am not a Jordan

citizen is therefore not correct. It is simply a matter of

fact that I am a Jordanian and a matter of record that

I have been a staff member in the Bank since the 25th day

of November 1953. It might interest you further to know

that I was the very first Arab ever to become a regular

staff member in the Bank.

(S)

"Perhaps it would also help if I also informed

you that appointment in the Bank is neither dependant

nor conditional upon the sponsorship of member governments.

In fact some of the staff are stateless and others are:

nationals of non-member states. Inspite of the above,

and although not a requirement, I am happy

to inform you

that I did, at the time of my appointment, obtain the

approval of
