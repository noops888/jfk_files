: DDO/LA Division Memo, dated 25 March 1977

On 23 March, Chris Hopkins of Latin America Division handcarried

photographs to uses a dent i ation tomatos experts or hot iseuese

and Identification Section.

2. The results of the comparison is as follows:

acial Shape - Close similarities, although there are sligh

lifferences which are probably due to subject's age differences

B. Chin - Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing

is most apparent here.

C. Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of

time factored in.

Set and Proportion of_ Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities.

(Comparison of eve detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)

E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but

the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend

from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet.

This could

be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting.

F. Mouth - The shape, proportion and expression of the mouth anc

he whole area from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin is perhaps

the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects. Here the similarities

are very close.

The proportions of the head, check bones and the body style of

the younger man tend to indicate he is of slavic origin.

3. The results of this type comparison are rarely absolute and are

usually limited by poor photo quality or differences in viewing angle

if they are of better quality,

are obtained, we would be happy to examine those as well.
