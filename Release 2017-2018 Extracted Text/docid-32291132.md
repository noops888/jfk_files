background info concerning himself and his family and father,

GUISSEPPI PINDELLI, which he stated could serve to corroborate with

the info furnished. Informant stated he himself has never

been initiated as a member of the "organization" but

comber on ther

CV° 157-127

It is to be noted according to info of NY T-2 on

page 28, report of SA JAMES FLYNN, 7/1/63, "LA COSA NOSTRA"

CHARLES CAVALLARO was In PG at this period and CV 344-C

advises he would be known by GUISSEPPI PINDELLI.

CV 344-0 stated that following PINDELLI's deportation

to Italy, he slipped back into the United States about two

months later and lived all over the United States with

members of the "organization"

He and his family later

moved to Warren, Ohio, and about 1941 or 1942 at the beginning

of World War II when it was necessary for aliens to register

PINDELLI was arrested by Warren, Ohio PD and held for

INS. Inasmuch as the U.S. was at war with Italy, It was

impossible to deport PINDELLI and he was placed

on bond

of $50,000, which was put up by members of the "organization."

When the war ended and it appeared that PINDELLI's arrest was

Imminent, the

indicated to him thathe should

take off

and skip his bond. He had apparently made satisfactory

arrangements with them, and he was not making enemies in

skipping the bond.

According to the informant, PINDELLI

then left Warren and traveled with a carnival based on

the West Coast through Calif., Oregon and Washington. PINDELLI

was later arrested at Informant's brother, FRANK's, home

at South Gate, Calif, and deported again to Italy.

PINDELLI

later immigrated legally to Buenos Aires, where his brother

ANTHONY PINDELLI, now deceased, was residing and where

PINDELLI remains

today.

According to informant, PINDELLI

has nephews and nieces

residing at Buenos and is residing

at 1372 Centenera, Capital 24, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Re: Pittsburgh "organization"

CV 344-C stated that GUISSEPPI PINDELLI was a close

associate of the seven VOLPE brothers in

PINDELLI had told him that (FNU) SPINELLI had been one of

about three persons responsible for the murders and fled

to Italy to escape reprisal and

was either apprehended

by authorities there or "they" (the "organization") caught

him and killed him in Italy.

According to informant,

PINDELLI was very close to the VOLPE brothers and or

occasion when GUY VOLPE (who later died of pneumonia) was

on the "lam", he stayed at the PINDELLI home in Scottdale,

Pa.

GIANNI BRAZZANO was also a close friand of

PINDELLI and it was in his

FRAZZANO, bar, where the three

VOLPE brothers were killed. Informant stated BRAZZANO

apparently was murdered at a leter date for his suspected

part in the VOLPE murders.

CV 344-C stated that BRAZZANO

has a son still residing in the PG area named JOHN BRAZZANO, .

who 1s: extremely close to young MIKE ROMEO of Campbell,

Ohio, who is the son of PAUL ROMEO, who is retired but held

in high respect by the "organization" and formerly a power

in Youngstown and Mahoning County.

Informant also stated

that there 1s still a couple of VOLPE brothers living in the

PG area, but he does not know them personally.

CV 344-C stated that TONY RIPEPI was once an

associate of PINDELLI and is the most powerful of the "organization"

in the PG area.

He stated there is no one higher in

washington or Allegheny countles and he also exerts

influence into W. Va.

He stated that although "CHUCK"

TEEMER is the front man for the Red Dog Club, a very

elaborate gambling casino, and previously Club 30 and

the Jockey Club, large gambling spots, TEEMER is merely

tolerated for his political influence, and all of the employees

of the club are working for TONY RIPEPI.

The informant stated that in 1927-1928 period,

when GUISSEPPI PINDELLI was in the PG area, GABRIEL and

SAMUEL MANNARINO of New Kensington, Pa., were just coming

up in the racket activities and PINDELLI would know them

and they in turn would know about him.

He stated that

dring the same period, MIKE ACQUARO was a power in the

"organization" but at

the present time he is allegedly

He stated that although ANDREW MANGINI is a member

ay the "organization" he is engaged In racket actlvities

in the PG area.

He is actually a "nobody"

as far as

power in the "organization" is concerned.

Informant summarized the PG area by stating

that in his opinion he is certain that RIPEPI 1s the

"boss" and although FRANK VALENTI attended the Apalachin

neeting, he was merely there as a representative of RIP&PI.

He stated that from the info he has

neeting was by no means a meeting of thered, the apalachin

the Mafia but was a meeting of the representatives of the

real bosses.

He stated that as

an example of this, JOHN

T. SCALISH of CV, was at this meeting and if he was there

he, informant, knows that he is not the "boss" of CV,

and if he attended, he was merely there as an emissary

Of ANTHONY MILANO.

Re: New York "organization

CV 344-C stated PINDELLI spent a great deal of

his time in NY and had high connections and one connection

was a

"power" one PASQUALE NAPOLI, Who controlled the

longshoremen in Brooklyn for years, but died about a year

ago.

He stated NAPOLI was his, the informant's, godfather.

Re: Cleveland "organization"

CV 344-C stated PINDELLI was a close associate

Of CICCIO MALANO, who now resides in Mexico.

He stated that

he was told by CICCIO MILANO that he could come and

him in Mexico and MILANO still exerts power in the "organization"

I rom Mexico.

ANTHONY MILANO, Calabrese, •Is the "boss"

in CV and is a close friend of PINDELLI.

CV 344-0 stated

ANTHONY MILANO's word is "law" even with the Sicilian group

in Toledo, Akron, Canton, Sandusky, Warren and Youngstown.

He stated

FRANK DE AUGUSTINI Owner

of the Roman Gardens,

Mayfield Rd, section of CV, is second in command of CV

under MILANO and is also a close friend of PINDELLI.

He

stated he does not know FRANK BRANCATO too well, but knows

he was a close friend of PINDELLI and is believed by the

informant to be next in command of the Calabrese group

under MILANO and DE AUGUSTINI.

CV 344-C stated regarding the CV area there are

two distinct groups in the "organization".

He stated this

1s unusual in that the Calabrese group is more highly

respected than the Sicilian group in this area.

He stated

his opinion comes from the reactions to different arguments

which have arisen and would have later been settled by

meetings. He stated the Sicillan group operates its own

enterprises and there is apparently a pact that they and

the Calabrese will not encroach on each others enterprises.

He stated that the Sicilians group includes JAMES

LICAVOLI, aka Jack White; OF Cleveland, "WHITEY" BESASE of

Toledo under LICAVOLI and ANGELO PERNA

of Toledo under

Toledo. Informant stated that LICAVOLI has GUS DIMA as the

representative at Sandusky, Ohio, who has his source of income

there.

At Canton, PAT FERRUCCIO was the representative

for LICAVOLI for years, but lost out for some unknown reason.

FERRUCCIO is still a member, but not in very good standing.

He stated he has heard of "BONES" BATTISTA of Canton,

and from what he has heard, BATTISTA supported the right

candidate in a local election and was able to operate, but

hai chartion

needed a "bank roll" for his operation and sought outside

help, and therefore LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALLE and

ANTHONY DELSANTER became his partners in a bookie and

numbers operation.

At Warren, Ohio, ANTHONY DELSANTER became "boss"

of the area

where MIKE FARAH, a Syrian, was murdered

16/10/61). "Organization" put up with FARAH as long as

he had influence and had politicians in his pocket, which

could be controlled. When he bacame obstriperous and

uncontrolable the

"organization" "dumped" him.

He also

stated that CHAFLES IMBURGIA, operator of the Sunrise

Inn, E. Market St., Warren, Ohio, may now be affiliated

with the Sicilian group of LICAVOLI, but at one time

several years ago was a part of the

pG group, headed by

RIPEPI.

The Akron area is part of the Sicilian group

operating in Toledo, Canton, Warren and Youngstown, and

JAMES LA FATCH seems to be the representative of LICAVOLI

in that area together with his brother TONY and would be

under the direct supervision of "WHITEY" BESASE of Toledo and

LICAVOLI in CV.

In connection with the influence of the Calabrese group

neaded by ANTHONY MILANO of Cleveland, CV 3+4-C gave the following

as an 1llustration: He statod that in abous 1958 he backed a

sheriff's candidate in Mansfield, hoping that if he was elected

he would be able to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield

and within the jurisdiction of the sheriff.

The candidate was

elected without any support whatsoever of TONY MOLLICA. He

started his house of prostitution, which was a money making

proposition and shortly thereafter MOLLICA approached him and

told him that people in town were talking and saying that he,

MOLLICA, was responsible for the house being able

and It was glving him a bad name because "memberg, to operate

supposed to engage in prostitution.

Informant told MOLLICA that

he had nothing to worry about as he was not involved, and 1t

then became apparent that MOLLICA was trying to get part of the

operation and profit. MOLLICA then turned to MIKE ROMEO of

Poland, Ohio, brother of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell, who was a friend

of Informant's father, and ROMEO called on the informant on

behalf of MOLLICA.

ROMEO told informant that he was "out of line"

and was giving MOLLICA a bad reputation in that he had moved

Into MOLLICA's territory. ROMEO told CV 344-0 to close the house

for a couple of months so that everything would "cool" down.

secured his own "fix" by backing the sheriff in

and the sheriff wanted nothing to do with MOLLICA and would not

allow him to operate anything.

Informant stated he was mad

about this interference and then wrote a letter to his father

In Buenos Aires and later received an answer to the letter..

With the answer he was instructed to take the letter to

PINDELLI'S good friend, ANTHONY MILANO In Cleveland, and

according to cv 344-C, he did this.

A couple of days later

Informant was called by "WHITEY" BESASE, who instructed him

to come to Akron to the home of JAMES LA FATCH for a meeting.

but informant refusec

en route or at the meeting.

He then called MILANO in the presence of MOLLICA and told MILANO

what they wanted of him. MILANO instructed MOLLICA that he was

instructing "the kid" (the informant) to accompany him to

Akron, and told MOLLICA that if a "hair on the head of PANDELLI"

was harmed he would see that the whole bunch was taken care of.

Informant then

got on the phone and was instructed by MILANO

to go to Akron with MOLLICA and

assembled. After a dinner, all except informant retired to the

basement where MOLLICA and

MIKE ROMEO were interrogated.

Informant

advised MOLLICA lied and denied that he had said what

he had and ROMEO became infuriated and left. Everyone shook

hands with the informant except ROMEO, and Informant was told

that he was

"not out of line"

and he should continue to operate.

He recalled the following individuals at the meeting:

LA FATCH

• MOLLICA

ROMEO

Cy 344-0 stated that about two weeks later he was

called to the liz Bar in Nansfield by we a0ind, a to the

presence of MOLLICA, ROMEO denounced MOLLICA as a

to forgive him.

After the meeting ROMEO

told the informant that he could go to ANTHONY MILANO in

Cleveland and tell him that everything was all straightened out.

Informant then went to DE AUGUSTINI, not wanting to bother MILANO

with such small details, and gave him the information, and

DE AUGUSTINI told him he would see that MILANO was advised.

He stated he had no further troubles with MOLLICA.

CV 344-0 stated that in Youngstown there are the same

two groups in the "organization" as in Cleveland.

The Calabrese

has some action,

and the Sicilian group under LICAVOLI have their

own ventures.

Both have respect for one another's enterprises.

The Calabrese is represented by DOMINICK MALLAMO, who 1s a more

or less successor to PAUL ROMEO, brother of MIKE ROMEO, and

MALLAMO 1s close to MILANO in Cleveland. MALLAMO is in a semi-

retired position but exacts tribute from those under him.

Second in command,

taking a more active part and soon to be the

leading representative of the Calabrese, 1s JAMES PRATO, aka

Regarding the Sicilian group of the "organization"

in Youngstown, CV 344-C stated he could not say if

VINCENT J. DE NIRO, bombing-murder victim, 7/17/61, was

a member of the "organization" or not, buü stated that

DE NIRO's murders caused great concern among ei1 motters

of the "organization"

He stated that of all of the murders

committed in the Youngstown area, this was the only murder

where members of the

"organization" made active efforts to

determine the persons responsible for same.

He cited inquiry

by PRATO, TRIPODI of Steubenville and RIPEPI of PG, as

DE NIRO was a big source of income for the group and was

cooperative.

CV 344-C stated that the "organization" made no

inquiry with him following the bombing-murder of CAVALLARO

and for this reason he believes CAVALLARO was killed for

getting "out of Jine"

• He stated if he had been killed

without the sanction of the "organization" they would have

inquired as to wao killed one of their members,

He stated

that in his opinion CAVALLARO had a portion of DE NIRO's

operation and

apparently tried to "hog" the entire operation

after his ceroh.

Regarcing JASPER JOSEPH ALELLO, UR., aKa

"Fats"

the informant advised he is no longer held in high respect

because he has

, "gotten out of line

by bad publicity and

by engaging in armed robbery and burglary.

He stated that

AJELLO had formerly been well thought of and in Youngstown

was on about the same level as ANTHONY DELSANTER presently

is in Warren.

Informant stated WILLIAM NAPLES, bombing-murder

victim, 7/1/62, was killed because the "organization" learned

he was

responsible for killing DE NIRO. According to the

informant, the NAPLES brothens were not part of either

the Calabrese or the Sicilian groups and did not contribute

to either group.

Regarding the killing of DOMINICK MOIO, whose

body was found stuffed in the trunk of his car at Canton,

Ohio, 9B/63, informant stated the "organization" made no

inquiry about his death which would mean to him that

MOIO had "gotten out of line"

•. MOIO had somehow obtained

employment

with the NAPLES brothers and unquestionably

"set up" BILLY NAPLES for his murder. CV 344-0 stated MOIO

may have gotten "out of line" by admitting to the FBI that

he had driven BILLY NAPLES to his car when he was blown

up.

Re: Steubenville "organization"

CV 344-C stated that JAMES TRIPODI fully controls

the Steubenville, Ohio area and exerts some influence into

certain sections of W. Va. He stated that as an example,

an "organization" members! restaurant known as the

Baron Restaurant owned by COSMO QUATRONE was held up by

some armed robbers from CV, Including DAVE TIBERZIO,

THOMAS "LAUGHING TOMMY" RUDELICK, VINCENT INNOCENZI, whose

body was found decomposed in Akron in the Summer of

and DOMINICK MAURICI.

The thieves had not cheeled with

TRIPODI before pullingthe armed robbery and as a result

INNOCENZI was killed and MAFRICI although the son-in-law

Of FRANK DE AUGUSSINI DI CV was killed In SU, 3/15/57,

while out ou bond. Informant noted that MAPRIC! waS

heard pleading for his life prior to being sho

"y calling

out "TONY don's do it,"

probably callirig to. CONY BUFFA of

CV, who was the alleged murderer. Informant steted this

was an examole ci what the

"organization"

considers getting

"out of lina" and anyone who does this will be punishec

accordingly no matter who they are or how they are connected.

It is noted that the above info is not being

disseminated to other offices, inasmuch as it must be

paraphrased to such an extent that the Informant cannot

be compromised at a later late.

The info contained in this

communication will be evaluated and will then be disseminated

to interested offices.

Informant advised in connection with his father,

GUISSEPPI PINDELLI, three separate attempts have been made

to secure a visa for him the last being about two years ago,

when It was felt he was going to be allowed re-entry but failed.

He stated he is 77 years of age and would be kept by informant's

sister of excellent reputation and with no possible burden to

the United States. Informant stated that if his father

returned he, being the oldest son, would be his chauffeur

and would give the informant an entree to the "organization"

Informant also stated his father wil? not get "out

St. Paul; and at their headquarters in Washington.

during the World War II years in Youngstown, Ohio, he knows

him or at least that there are close friends in common and

informed CAVALLARO that he did not have any connection

with gambling matters in Campbell and that he therefore

was in no position to approach these persons and advise

them how to handle their gambling activities.

Informant stated SAVALLARO did not discuss

the matter any further with nim as. race meetings however,

subsequently he met with CAVALLARO at Cicerois Restaurant

in Youngstown, several times and on each occasion CAVALLARO

reiterated his demands concerning the Campbell operations

stating that if they did not come across soon he was going

to "muscle in" on them. He disclaimed having any connection

with, or knowledge of, CAVALLARO's alleged control of

the barbut game in Campbell and stated that his name was

frequently associated with such activities because he often

would do favors for many of them by interceding on their

behalf when minor disputes arose.

He stated that DI CARLO cauced a "flock" of old timers from

various parts of the country to come into Youngstown, which

undoubtedly has been a factor in the overall confusion

of the racket leadership in Youngstown in recent years.

Informant revealed that then during the regime of

Mayor CHARLES HENDERSON and Chief of Police EDWARD ALLEN in •

Youngstown, they brought enough pressure to bear on DI CARLO

that he was forced to abandon his

racket control and

leave the city which practically "left it up for grabs."

He explained that about that time SANDY NAPLES

and VINCE DE NIRO started out together in the vending machine

business and in the numbers racket in Youngstown. He stated

that this partnership was doing quite well but ran into

difficulties when DE NIRO

accused

SANDY NAPLES

of using narcotics and a number of

In this regard, informant mentioned that VINCE

DE NIRO, with whom informant was very close, left a lot of

money to his mother, and that this was probably done in

such a manner that it would be kept from Probate Court.

Then, following DE NIRQ's death, BILLY NAPLES

was killed as a result of a bomb which wentoff when he

tried to start his car, and informant 1s of the opinion

that here again

1s a continuation of this family feud,

and added that he is of the opinion that BILLY NAPLES'

death was caused or brought about by the DE NIRO organization.

Informant was

asked at this point whether or not he felt

that the bombing of BILLY NAPLES could have been caused

by the "syndicate" and he replied negatively.

explained

that he knews very definitely and positively

that the "syndicate" does not believe in bombing deaths

and as a matter of fact they are outlawed by the "syndicate."

He further explained that the "syndicate" might use a stick

or two of dynamite to frighten or to warn someone or to set

up someone for a possible shake-down, but they would

not kill by bombing.

Then followed the death of CHARLES CAVALLARO by

a bombing on 11/23/62. Informant feels very

strongly from his past experiences with the "Syndicate" anc

from individuals with whom he has spoken since CAVALLARO'S

death, that DOMINIC MOIO was responsible for CAVALLARO'S

death

and was hired to do this by the NAPLES brothers.

Informant added that MOIO's subsequent murder,

in his opinion, was definitely and positively a "syndicate"

killing and MOIO was killed because he should have known

better than to kill CAVALLARO because he had definite

knowledge that CAVALLARO was a "syndicate" man, but never-

theless particiated in his killing strictly for money.

Informant added that MOIO's death warrant would have

to have been approved by the Cv "syndicate"

and

specifically by JOHN T. SCALISH.

Informant further revealed that he does not feel

that JOEY or JIMMY NAPLES (the only two remaining NAPLES

brothers) will be the next individual marked for killing

because their deaths would not prove anything, and in

addition, there is really nothing left for the NAPLES

brothers in Youngstown but headaches.
