briefly with ROSSELLI in the steam room area, and ROSSELLI

immediately asked informant if he had seen "that guy"

(meaning GEORGE SEEDMAN, for whom informant may work in

connection with SEEDMAN's vending machine operation).

ROSSELLI immediately started telling informant what informant

machine operation informant

should tell SEEDMAN and again requested informant to find

out all he could about SEEDMAN.

Thereafter, FRIEDMAN and ROSSELLI went into the

cocktail lounge at the Friar's Club and joined the unknown

man mentioned above.

on 12/14/62 LA 4268-C advised that on the previous

day, 12/13/62, he observed ROSSELLI at the Friar's Club at

about five o'clock playing cards with an individual named

ALEXANDER RUDOLPH.

ROSSELLI was losing money and FRIEDMAN

took his

place and shortly after

"got ROSSELLI even."

Informant learned that JOSEPH I. BREEN, JR., a

close friend and business associate of ROSSELLI, is currently

writing and directing a Biblical picture.

Informant did not

know for whom he was working or the name of the picture.

Informant advised that at about 6 p.m. on 12/13/62

MILTON BERLE, JACK BENNY, and GEORGE BURNS, well-known enter-

tainers, arrived at the Friar's Club and a photographer took

colored pictures of them seated in the cocktail lounge. They

then went into the dining room where another group colored

picture was taken at which time the doors were open into the

gambling room.

Included in this latter picture were ROSSELLI

and FRIEDMAN playing cards.

The purpose of the pictures was

apparently to show that celebrities belong to the club, and

the club intends to make colored post cards of these pictures.

After the pictures were taken MILTON BERLE told

informant that he was going to Las Vegas in the near future

with Dodger baseball players, DRYSDALE, KOUFAX, MAURY WILLS,

and HOWARD, where these ball players would appear in an act

in one of the hotels, which act would be built around MILTON

BERLE.
