The simple length of time that this agent has been

as a possible

factor in

exposing him sooner or later.

One item that becomes evident when reviewing (KDAFGHAN

files is his repeated failure (with some few

exceptions) to get photographs of suspects or agents

that

the Station knows visited AMFINK while he was

purportedly on watch.

Given the above the Station decided to mount an operation

designed to determine once and for all if the KDAFGHANS were

either under control by AMSTAFF or if their activities were being

monitored by audio coverage of the Safehouse or OP site.

DCOS designed a sophisticated scenario to be played out by the

Case Officer which would, one by one, eliminate or prove each of

the above possibilities.

No other Station assets were used, this

paragraphs 14-16 of Reference A. We will start a search for a

replacement site and agent as soon as Headquarters indicates that

they believe the continuance of such an operation is worthwhile

(the station believes it is). We intend to continue to handle

the agent just as before,

We will proceed to

improve his equipment and operation and

go ahead with the planned technical consultation

(Reference E)

to demonstrate this.

No sensitive equipment or information will

be involved.

We further intend to SGSWIRL

opportunity. He was last SWIRLED on 18 April 1967.

Other Operational Developments:

than the above,

the operation continued

as usual.

The Case Officer had another

dawn to midnight stay with the Agent to observe AMFINK and its

activities and to work with the Agent on improving his production.

Quality of the photographs has improved and identification of

BRUMEN visitors has, with the use of KDGLACIER passport photos

increased drastically - we are now hitting

over eighty percent

identification of TDYers and transit personnel. The planned MO

studies mentioned in paragraph 12 of Reference A have not been as

successful as was hoped for.UZKDAFGHAN-1 and 2 are so set in the

routine they have established over the years that the above

mentioned instructions to change their way of operation have met

with resistance.

This is being overcome.

7. Agent Personnel:

No changes. The break in their regular

occasioned by our requests for more work on their part

and by the extra and irregularly scheduled meetings caused by

our CI operation seemed to have increased KDAFGHAN-I's already

bad state of nerves.

vacation to Acapulco to calm him down - and

it did somewhat.

8. Administrative/Finances: No changes.
