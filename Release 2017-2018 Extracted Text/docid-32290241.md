On May 24, 1961, Miss BETTY GEORGE, 300 East 57th

Street, Apartment 2C, New York, New York, advised SAS

DONALD E. JONES and

• WILLIAM D. KANE that

she first met

GUS ALEX in approximately 1950. At that time, she was

with the road company of the broadway play,

"Kiss Me Kate".

Miss GEORGE stated that she is presently a

singer who

performs with the MILTON BERLE show.

She said that

she could not recall. She stated that she and ALEX had a

very short, casual conversation, mainly dealing with the

fact that they were both of Greek extraction.

She stated she next saw ALEX in 1955 when she

was appearing at the Latin Quarter in New York City.

ALEX attended a show one evening and between performances

introduced her to his wife, MARIANNE, referring to her

(Miss GEORGE) as his "Greek cousin".

He invited her to

have dinner with him and his wife,

but she refused this

invitation because of a prior commitment. Miss GEORGE

stated that these are the only contacts she has had with

ALEX. She said she knows nothing at all about what ALEX

does for a living or who his associates might be.

She

identified photographs of ALEX and his former wife,

MARIANNE.

Miss GEORGE further advised that during the month

of June, 1961,

she will appear with MILTON BERLE at the

Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas,

Nevada, and that in the

event she comes in contact with ALEX in the future, she

will advise the New York Office of the FBI.
