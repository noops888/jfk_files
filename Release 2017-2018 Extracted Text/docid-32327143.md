the conversation that he was overseas and that

he would

be there for a lengthy period of time,

inasmuch as he

probably was going to set up a hotel or casino in Madrid.

This PCI, who is in an excellent position to know, recalled

that CAIN has made several trips from Chicago to Mexico

to contact GIANCANA.

When he returned CAIN told him that

GIANCANA is in Mexico and had plenty money and is friendly

with New York people, who are dealing in a big way in

narcotics. PCI advised that it is obvious to him that CAIN

is working very closely at the present time with GIANCANA.

PCI advised that it is his opinion that CAIN is in Spain working

on behalf of GIANCANA and that he will involve himself there

in narcotics.

He said the way it works CAIN will establish

a "front"', such as a hotel or casino and after this he will

work probably with the New York leadership of organized crime

as a go-between for narcotics traffic between Madrid and

New York.

on June 12, 1972, the PCI feels that CAIN will remain in

Spain indefinitely.(U)

From the above and since it appears certain that

CAIN has not returned to the Chicago area since May 1, 1972,

it would appear that CAIN is working on behalf of GIANCANA

in Mexico and in Spain. Contact with logical sources and

informants particularly with CG 7016-CTE and with CG 9561-PCI

are being closely maintained and the Bureau will be kept

advised of all developments. (4)

The Bureau is requested to consider furnishing

the above information to Legats in Mexico City and in Madrid

for any information available there concerning the presence
