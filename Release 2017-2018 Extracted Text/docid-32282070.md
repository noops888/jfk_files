As the Bureau noted in reairtel, Miami has inter-

viewed OSCAR FERNANDEZ VEIGA; ELISEO GOMEZ FERNANDEZ, OfF

the same company, has been interviewed and TEOFILO BABUN

SELMAN has been interviewed and reinterviewed. Each person

denied knowledge of the existence of any such plan as the

above and specifically denied being a party to any such

plan, or even having discussed any specific sum of money.

hert minate en richful,

All of the above were, of course, advised of their

right to refuse to answer any question which they felt might

incriminate them; each was also requested not to lie, but to

either answer truthfully or refuse to answer at all.

Apparently each one lied, and gave every appearance of having

agreed befcehand to deny

knowledge of any such plot, as BABUN

and one of his associates were interviewed so closely together

as not to allow. time for them to confer and agree upon what

m..rn.

should be said, between interviews.

Apparently also the plan is very nebulous and

indefinite, but nevertheless the persons interviewed must

have discussed such a plan to

i possibility they may have at seen exte

some extent.

knowledse of any suci plot, siace one ot, the above.

and he dented knowledge i amy, such plotre

In view of the above denials, it is difficult to

see how any useful purpose could possibly be served by con-

ductiing further interviews, and it is reconnended thnt none

of the persons ba reinterviewed, and

be ignored.

It is not felt that S

further investijation is warranted in this matter.

8/13'64, BYRON, CAMERON was interviewed at Ft.

Lauderdale, Fla., with following results:

BYRON RIGGS CAMERON was born Elizabeth, N. J.,

5/22/16; he is married and has two children, ages 23 and

17. He is President of Caribe Irading Co., Ltd.; H. F.

JENNE is Secretary-Treasurer, and interview of JENE already

réported to bureau.

CAMERON denied any knowledge of any plot to assassi

nate FIDEL CASTRO or any other government leaders of Cuba; *e

stated all of his warenousemen and. longshoremen are Cuban, all

are suffering because of FIDEL CASIRO and consequently all

vehemently anti-CASTRO, and he is never around them without

some of them mentioning how much better the world would be if

someone would kill FIDEL CASTRO and his brother, RAUL CASIRO.

He denied knowing anyone in the Mafia or "Cosa

Nostra;" he said he could not understand why BABUN would have

to approach JOSE "PEPIlY" BOSCH, JULIO LODO oI anyone else to

raise one hundred or one hundred fifty thousand dollars; that

in his opinion,

this would be "chicken feed to BAPUN, who could

raise a million" in twenty four hours if he needed it.
