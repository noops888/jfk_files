Re:

Lesar v. CIA, No. 92-2215 CRR

Dear Ms. Moreau:

This letter advises you that the Director of Central

Intelligence has determined, as a matter of policy, to direct the

Agency to search the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings for

information responsive to the Freedom of Information Act request

underlying the referenced litigation.

Pursuant to our conversation with James besar, the search

will be limited to the minutes for meetings occurring on or

between the dates 22 November 1963 and 31 December 1979.

Responsive portions of

the minutes, if any, may constitute

"assassination records" under the the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. No.

102-526, 106 Stat. 3443 (October 27, 1992) - Therefore,

responsive portions probably will be transferred to the Agency's

probably ver

Historical Review Group (HRG) for processing under the standards

of the ARCA.

The HRG, already fully engaged processing the

records at

issue in the Allen v. DOD and AARC V. CIA cases,

probably will not be able to address this information until late

summer

or early fall 1993.

Under the ARCA, the Agency has

until

22 August 1993 to complete its review of identified assassination

records.

The HRG is making its best possible effort to meet that

deadline.

In light of the Director's decision, I see our options for

responding to this litigation as:

(1) moving to dismiss the case for failure to exhaust

administrative remedies--no administrative appeal. It

successful, this would remove plaintiff's argument that he

is entitled to some expedited treatment under the ARCA.

(2) moving for an Open America stay on a first-in,

first-out basis.

There are a number of FOIA requests that

predate the one

at issue in this case.

For instance, the

Allen request predates this one and, therefore, should be

processed first, even if the litigation is settled.

(3) attempting to settle with Mr. Lesar by agreeing to

provide him with free copies of whatever responsive portions

of the minutes are located and released under the ARCA. In

exchange for this agreement, Mr. Lesar must dismiss the

litigation with prejudice.

Each option has its own merits. Please call me so we may

discuss these courses

of

action.

Sincerely,

Robert J. Batinger, Jr.

Assistant General Counsel
