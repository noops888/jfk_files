SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

On 4/18/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III as

follows:

Years ago, when the MANNARINOs first operated their horse-room

on the second floor on Fifth Avenue, New Kensington, ta.

results were received by wire connected to Jess Taub Credit

Jewelers, 940 Fifth Avenue, New Kensington.

TAUB, the late TOM GALION was a partner in the jewelry store.

About one year ago, MICHAEL RODITES, who works in the current

MANNARINO horse-room, said that results were received by

"direct line" from New Orleans, Louisiana, and that results

from other areas of the country came in about 15 minutes after

the race.

Rumor among New Kensington gamblers is that KELLY MANNARINO

feels that his horse-room is getting all the $2 betsidirectly
