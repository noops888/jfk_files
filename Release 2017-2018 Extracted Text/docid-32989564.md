Captioned individual telephonically contacted my oifice at 10:15 a.m.

today, Saturday, November 21, and spoke with SA Hanning who was on duty.

Miss Wells advised that she was one of the 18 women reporters

who were in on the interview with ir. Hoover. She stated that she understands

that Martin luther Ring now wants to come in and talk to the Director. She

wanted to know it she could cover this interview and in the event she could not

cover the interview itself, she wanted to know if she could talk to both the

Director and King immediately after the meeting if there was one.

Manning advised Miss Wells that the Director's schedule was

very full and that Mr. Hoover was leaving the city on official business in the

near future and he was unaware of any such appointment and could not be of

assistance to her. iViss Wells was very insistent and stated she would probably

call back again Monday to check on any new developments concerning this

matter.

RE:

MATRIMAN OF THE BOARD

O CURTIS PUBLISHING COMPANY

Mr. Gale -

Mr. Rosen 1

Mr. SuBiyank

Mr. Tavel -

Mr. Trotter -

As you know, there has been a bloody power struggle

Tele. Room

within the Curtis organization aimed at deposing our good friend, Joe

Miss Holmes

Culligan, Chairman of the Board, and, until about a week or so ago,

Miss Gandy

President. Bitter charges of mismanagement were Hurled at Culligan

by

a dissident group of top officials headed by_Claj*Blair, Jr., Editor in Chief of "The

Saturday Evening Post" and all Curtis magazines, and Marvin Dr/Kantor, $80, 000

a year Senior Vice President in charge of the magazine división. In a nutshell,

Blair and Kantor have been fired; Normansitter, Assistant Managing Editor, and

Thomas R. Marvel,

Chief of Editorial Production, have been suspended. Culligan,

who has been actively looking for a top executive to assist him in running the affairs

of Curtis for sometime, resigned as President while retaining his job as Chairman

of the Board. It is expected that a new President will be named soon.

# This top management revolt, which has been brewing for some months,

erupted openly during the early part of October when the press reported that fifteen

top officials in a letter to the Board of Directors accused Culligan of mismanagement.

At the present time,

it appears that Culligan has retained the confidence of the Board

of Directors, has seized the initiative, and is making a thorough house cleaning.

Culligan has been a good friend of the Director and the Bureau for

a number of.years. He has demonstrated his support and admiration on numerous

occasions and has been most cooperative with us. It was he who offered to feature

a lead article in a May issue of the "Post" concerning the Director's 40th Anniversary,

with a photograph of Mr. Hoover on the cover. Earlier, through Culligan, we

squelched the unfavorable article against the Bureau being written by free-lance

writer, Dan J. Marlowe, submitted to the "Post" concerning our investigation of

Nussbaum and Wilcoxson. More recently, through Culligan, we postponed publication

in the "Post'' of an article based upon the assault of our Agent Foley in New York by

the Lombardozzi family. Early in 1964,

we received word of an article being

published in the "Post"' by Martin Luther King. Through Culligan,

we forestalled

publication of this article. More recently, with the Director's approval, I

contacted Culligan on September 22, 1964,

concerning another article our sources

"told us that Martin Luther King was preparing for the "Post"

At that time, Culligan,

who was in the midst of this rebellion, had told us that he would endeavor to assist

us but indicated at the same time that a possible contractual agreement existed with

King. Culligan had been previously discreetly briefed concerning King's domination

by communist influences and of his shameful immoral character. Culligan has

advised that a contract did exist with King for the "Post" article and that the

recalcitrant group within Curtis had insisted that publication of it be carried through

because of King's recent Nobel Peace Prize. Although he was completely sympathetic

with our aims and regretted his inability to be of service in this specific instance,

he pointed out that we should feel free to call upon him in the future if there is any

way in which he can be of help to the Bureau. Culligan advised that the King article

was scheduled for early publication sometime after election.

In connection with this "Post" article by King, our sources have

indicated that since he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize he has attempted through

some of his associates to change the "Post" article in an effort to soften criticism

made by him against other civil rights groups and leaders. King feared that such

criticism would cause difficulties in the civil rights movement.

The "Post" however,

has resisted King's efforts to make these changes.

to Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCIC), pertaining to his massive civil

: disobedience campaign to be held in Washington, D.C.,

in

April, 1968.

BACKGROUND:

King in the past has publicly announced he will

conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign he calls the

"Washington Spring Project" in early April, 1968, to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

ELSUR

NY 3810-S* advised recently that Stanley David

Levison and Clarence Jones, both advisors to King with sub-

versive backgrounds, were in conference concerning King's

project. Jones informed Levison that Harry Wachtel, another

advisor of King's with a subversive background, had drafted

some material that King could use during the campaign calling

for full employment, a guaranteed wage,

and a guaranteed annual

income. Also, the Reverend Frederick Kirkpatrick, a New York

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Levison told Jones that he had received an excellent

response to a recent mailing. The solicitations were running

ahead of last year with $15,000 being received in one day.

Levison informed that the letter soliciting funds was carefully

written explaining King's project and, because of the success,

he was sending it to 250,000 more people.

Levison also told Jones that things are going well

in the mobilization. for the project and King informed him that

people from Alabama and Mississippi are "just raring to go."

OBSERVATIONS:

On February 28, 1968, a WFO informant informed us

that Bernard Lafayette, project Director for SCLC, had informed

him King's organization is experiencing difficulty with re-

cruiting demonstrators for the "Washington Spring Project."

Because of this, the demonstrations would not start the first

week of April as originally planned.

Another WFO informant learned from Lafayette's

assistant, Anthony Henry, that a secret meeting had been held

by King's group and they had set April 27, 1968, as the date

for the project to start. Henry indicated this date can be

moved up or back depending on future developments.

It is felt that the President would be interested in

receiving information showing the communist help King is re-

ceiving in his proposed "Washington Spring Project."

RECOMMENDATION:

That copies of the enclosures be forwarded to

Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House; Mr. William Welsh,

Administrative Assistant to the Vice President; Secretary of

Agriculture Freeman; Secretary of Labor Wirtz; Secretary of

Defense; Secret Service; the Attorney General; the Deputy

Attorney General; Assistant Attorneys General

The "Commercial Appeal" newspaper, Memphis,

Tennessee, reported in its issue of March

26, 1968,

that mediation talkson the issues of the 7-week-old

sanitation strike in Memphis, Tennessee, ran for more

than four hours on the afternoon of March 25, 1968, after

a brief interlude during which Chancellor Robert Hoffman,

Shelby County Chancery Court, ruled that members of the

American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees

who were under injunction in

his court could represent the

workers in their negotiations with the City.

It will be recalled that it was originally reported

on March 25, 1968, that Reverend Martin Luther king, Jr.,

Te NiN

President of the Southern Christian Leadership. Conference (SCiC),

would lead a massive march in

Memphis on Friday, March 29, 1968. •

On the late night of March 25, and the morning of

the evening of March 25, 1968, by the Community on the

Move for Equality (COME) , the

name adopted by the Memphis

to commence at 10 a.m., Thursday, March 28, 1968, to

This march will be led by Reverend

Martin Luther King, Ji., who is expected to arrive in

Memphis early on the morning of March 28, 1968.

On the night of March 28, 1968, Reverend Martin

Negro evangelist who formerly lived in Memphis and whose

daughter, Aretha Fran the, is a nationally known clythm

source's opinion, Franklin will

draw a tremendous crowd due to not only his personal popularity

in the Negro religious community, but by virtue of the

popularity of his daughter.

It is planned by the COME leaders that both

Di. Franklin and Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., will

remain in Memphis until Saturday, March 30, 1968, at which

time another mamnoth

march is scheduled in

downtown Memphis,

this again to commence at Clayborn Temple at 10 a.u.,

Source one

stated that in all probability when

the marchers come up Main Street in front of the Memphis

City Hall that King and others will probably stop and

address the marchers from the plaza area in front of the

Memphis City Hall, The government plaza consists of

¡our major buildings, ald facing Main Street between Adams

and Poplar, these being the City hall, the federal Bullding,

the Tennessee State Office Building, and the Memphis Police

RACIAL MATTERS

Jenn

On March 27, 1968, Lt. E. H. Arkin, Inspectional

Bureau, Police Department, Memphis,

Tennessee, advised that

the sanitation strike in Memphis which began February 12

1968, continues unabated and that negotiations between Memphis

city

officials and representatives of the striking workers

continue under the leadership of the appointed mediator,

Frank Miles.

I't. Arkin advised that a reliable source of the

police Department has stated that a mass meeting in support

of the strike was held at the Trinity CME Church, Thomas and

Wells, the night of March 26, 1968, with the guest speaker

being

Fatherx Parker, affiliated with the World Council of

Churches

He spoke, endorsing the sanitation workers, and

called for Negro people to get together and for teachers in

the school system to stop feeling as though they were above

the sanitation workers and for the sanitation workers to stop

feeling they are below everyone else.

It was learned that after this meeting HarolaYuiddle.

of the CME church; Rev. Sam B./Kyles, head of the Metropolitan

Baptist Church; and Jesse Epps, Field Director, American Federa-

tion of state, County and Municipal Employees, and others held

a strategy meeting, at which time Jackson, who is representing

the union in negotiations with the city, was of the opinion

that he should "walk out" on the negotiations as the negotia-

tions were getting nowhere.

SANITATION WORKERS STRIKE,

MSHPHIS, TENNESSEE

The "Connercial Appeal" newspaper, issue of

March 28, 1968, reported that Union leaders representing

striking sanitation workers walked out of mediation

talks with City government representatives at heuphs,

Tennessee, in connection with the T-week sanitation strike,

said walkout being at 6 p.l., March 27, 1968.

The break-off

came during the third day of

Mediator Frank B, Miles.

The Union called a press conference at 6:30 p.i.,

March' 27, 1968, at Clayborn Temple where indiviquals col.

nected with the Union charged mayor Henry Loeb in eriect

had tied the City Committee's hands on the crucial issue of

Union recognition. The Union charged, according to the

paper, that the biggest roadblock was a contention by the

Committee that it had no power to agree on anything.

that only the Mayor could make any binding agreenents.

The City Committee, however, claimed that the Union

demanded that it first be recognized as an exclusive

bargaining agent before any other points of issue could

be discussed, with the impasse resulting.

The same issue of the newspaper reported that

on the night of March 27, 1968, Reverend Ralph D. Abernathy,

Vice President at Large of the

SCLC, spoke to about five

trucks with their bodies.

The paper further reported that

sanitation officials had reported that 95 trucks were on

the streets, March 26, 1968, the most since the curb-side

pickoup system was started shortly after the start of the

strike.

Also on the morning of March 28, 1968, source one

advised that it had been ascertained that

Reverend Ralph D

Abernathy would also accompany King and Lee on their departure

from Memphis via Eastern Airlines Flight 398, to leave hempta

đt 9:05 p.M., March 28, 1968.
