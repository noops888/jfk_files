NOTE ON YELLOW:

Interpen is an organization made up of American

volunteers, mercenaries, vagrants and adventurers.

Membership

has a high

turnover inasmuch as members become disillusioned

and leave. The group allegedly is interested in adventure

and is willing to go to any Latin-American country to engage

in any revolution.

The leader and his group are reportedly.

completely irresponsible, are not expected to accomplish

any positive action; and are stimulated by publicity given

them in Miami.

The Department and interested agencies have

been advised of all previous information received concerning

this organization.

Information contained in Miami airtel dated 7-10-61.
