Mr. James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security for

Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

This Fitness Report covers the period from Lapril

1971 to 31 March 1972. The rating period covers the third full

year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of

Security for Physical, 'lechnical and Overseas Security.

2.. The dircetorate which Mr. O'Connoll supervises is

goographically widely separated in the Headquarters area. This

separation adds complexitics to the lask of supervising the

directorate and coordinating the activities uf three Divisions,

operating over a biond spectrum of activitics and responsibilities.

During the cortiny period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connoil'e

directorale look er on important, added responsibility--the security

of automatic data processing. This function covers the complexity

of maintaining securil; in a rapidly expanding activity replete with

serious security problems because of the severe compaction of

information resulting from rapid advances ind accoptability of

technology in the fiold of data handling. The achievements of the

scas Security Support Division roguire a high degrec of coordina

tion in ordor to avoid contradictions detrimental lo a unified

security policy.

3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotcly

located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achieved

effective supervision. The Divisions moved forward in an

2. Mr. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Securit;

this Rating covers his performance during this period as well is

his performance as Executive Officer frorn 1 April 1968 to 1 August

3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Fliysical,

of three large and complex divisions of this Office. In addition,

he is responsible for províding policy and technical guidance to

our Area Security Officers assigned to other components of ile

Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1?58,

Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of

these varied and complex activities.

He is ar alert and intelligent

supersisor and he recommendre and put into effect several sig iti-

cant personnel and organizational charges within his Directorate

which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall

formances. He possesses all of the requisito qualities of a senior

Security executive.

However, I feel that he has not as yoi applied

all of these qualities to sheir maximum potential in his performance

ag-DD/PTOS. Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chiel who is evira-

ordinarily capable and elective in producing results. Conversely,

however, he presents one df the most difficult supervisory problems

in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't

feel, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that

he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. i

am consinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and

is working hard to achiere the proper supervisory balance. I rate

his performance, on balaace, as STRONG with many outstanding features.

I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and

excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office ind the

Agency.

Chief, Executive Staff

1. Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of

this Office from 1 April 1967 to 31 Murch 1968, the rating period

covered by this Fitness Report.

Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration

and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the

functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective

in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic

security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed

diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper

that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been

meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving

this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective

in arranging priority action in meeting short deadlines. As the

initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence

received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in

applying his knowledgé of the basic organization of the Office to thi

assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior

executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive

experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and

overscas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance.

ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing

responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance

in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive

for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of

his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however,

that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his

enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for

the firat six months in this position. It is possible that this is due

to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more

measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiast: and

initiative. Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive

for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT

: Narrative Fitness Report

Mr. James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security for

Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from l April

1971 to 31. March 1972.

The rating period covers the third full

year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of

Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security.

2. The directorate which Mr. O'Connell supervises is

geographically widely separated in the Headquarters area.

separation adds complexities to the task of supervising the

directorate and coordinating the activities of three Divisions,

operating over a broad spectrum of activities and responsibilities.

During the reporting period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell's

directorate took on an important,

added responsibility--the security

of automatic data processing.

This function covers the complexity

of maintaining security in a rapidly expanding activity replete with

serious security problems because of the severe compaction of

information resulting from rapid advances and acceptability ni

technology in the field of data handling.

The achievements of the

Physical Security Division, the Technicai Division, and the Over-

seas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordina-

tion in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified

security policy.

3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely

located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achieird.

effective supervision.

The Divisions moved forward in an

innovative manner and have been effective in discharging thelr

responsibilities.

*" Mr. O'Connell also spearheade the security program

which furnishes Security Officers to overseas stations and domestic

operations as necessary. Mr. O'Connell has taken a personal

interest in this activity and has been of considerable assistance to

the Office of Security Career Board in the assignment of Security

careerists to those positions.

During the last Fitness Report, the description of Mr.

O'Connell's performance was raised from "Strong" to "Outstanding."

He has continued his performance in such a manner as to warrant

an OUTSTANDING rating.

Mr. James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security for

Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

1.

This is a narrative Fitness Report which covers the

period from l April 1970 through 31 March 1971.

2. During this entire period, Mr. O'Connell has served

as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and

Overseas Security.

The rating period covers his second full year

in that position. The Directorate which Mr. O'Connell heads has

gained added importance and increased attention during the year.

It encompasses an area of activity which is vitally important to

the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole. Mr. O'Connell

has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our

vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from

domestic efforts resulting from national unrest. Mr. O'Connell

has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his respon-

sibilities throughout the current rating period. He supervises his

people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to

simplify their solutions.

.3.. During the previous

rating period, Mr. O'Connell's

performance was considered to be STRONG with several outstanding

features. During the year, I consider that there has been sufficient

addition to the outstanding areas of his performance to raise his

over-all rating to OUTSTANDING.

him a valuable career asset of this Office. His has been a difficult

task in that as well as assuming new and additional functions, he

has been burdened with the supervision of one Division Chief who

has proven to be extremely difficult to handle over the years. In

fairness to Mr. O'Connell, I should add that no one in this Office

has been particularly effective in supervising this individual who

is now slated for carly retirement. I believe that with this individ-

ual's departure Mr. O'Connell should be able to achieve a more

coherent irtegration of his Directorate's functions in the interest

of further efficiency and effectiveness.

1.

This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1968

through 31 March 1969:

2. Mi. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Security

for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security in August 1968 and

this Rating covers his performance during this period as well as

his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to l August

1968.

3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,

Technical and Overseas Security, is responsible for the supervision

of three large and complex divisions of this Office. In addition,

he is responsible for providing

policy and technical guidance to

our Area Security Officers assigned io other components of the

Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1963,

Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of

these varied and complex activities.

He is an alert and intelligent

supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several signifi-

cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate

which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall

efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate. Recently, he was

instrumental in creating a new Overseas Security Support Division

He brings to the performance of his duties

broad knowledge and experience of security procedures and practices.

He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary

obligations within his Directorate.

4. Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to

express himself well in both written and oral form. His career

is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level per-

He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior

Security executive.

However, Ifeel that he has not as yet applied

all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his performance

as DD/ PTOS:

Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chief who is extra-

ordinarily capable and effective in producing. results.

Conversely,

however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisory problems

in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't

feel, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that

he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. I

am convinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and

is working hard to achieve the proper supervisory balance. I rate

his performance, on balance, as STRONG with many outstanding features.

I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and

excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office and the

Agency.

Chief, Executive Staff

1.

Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of

this Office from I April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period

covered by this Fitness Report.

2.

Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration

and direction.of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the

functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective

in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic

security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed

diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper

that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been

meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving

this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective.

in arranging priority action in mecting short deadlines. As the

initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence

reccived by this Office for action, he has been very effective in

applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the

assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior

executive who writes particularly well.

He has had extensive

experience as a Security carcerist, both in Headquarters and

overseas,

and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance-

ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing

responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance

in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive

for further improvement, 1 am hard put to find any in the light of

his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however,

that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his

enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for

the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due

to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more

measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and

initiative, Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive

for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

has an engaging, friendly personality and is effectively articulate.

If I were to single

out any weaknees it would be Mr. Engelhardt's lecture.: He spoke on the Systeme

Analyst. In his presentation he seemed not to take into consideration the professlonal

level of the group and devoted an inordinate amount of time on baale managerial

precepts.. This seemed to have an irritating elfect on the participants who by virtue

of their positions had conalderable experience in the management fleld.

Overall I would say, notwithetanding the above observation, It is an Interesting

1. This memorandum will supplement the information contained

in Mr. Victor R. White'g

memorandum of 10 April 1967, since Mr.

O'Connell was reassigned to the position of Chief, Security Policy and

Executive Staff on 9 January 1967.

2. This then covers the period from 9 January 1967 to 31 March

1967. During this period, Mr. O'Connell quickly justified the selection

for this key position in the Office of Security and has already begun to

demonstrate his executive talents in this position.

3.

Although the period for which he is being rated in this position

is too short to be characterized definitively or finally, I would say that

his progress thus far justifies an unqualified rating of "Outstanding".

a calm, clinical approach to work problems, and his solutions to

these problems reflect the soundness of his judgment and the

(Fitness Report)

This is an Annual Fitness Report on the above employee

for the period ending 31 Sarch 1966. Mr. O'Connell is currently

assigned as Assistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS), a position

he assumed in September 1905. He was promoted to GS-16 at the

time he assumed these responsibilities on the basis of a long per-

iod of distinguished service that was culminated in his assignment

as Regional Security Oificer ive the Far East.

2.

As iny Assistant, Mr. O'Connell shares with me the re-

sponsibility for the direction of the investigative and operational

support programs of the Office of Security. He brings to this posi-

tion a wealth of experience, sound management concepts, and the

ability to meet and solve complex administrative problems. I have

implicit confidence in his judgment, and he enjoys the full respect

of all of his associates. Me. O'Connell has made an outstanding

contribution to the management and direction of lOS at a time when

our work load is the highest in history.

He is susceptible to inno-

vation and has a keen appreciation of cost factors in meeting his

managerial responsibilities. He has a unique ability to put work

problems in the proper focus, does his job without fanfaré, and

maintains extremely high standards of work accomplishment.

3. Mir. O'Connell's performance fully justifies his promotion

to the supergrade level and, in the relatively short time he has been

in his current assignment, his overall performance is considered:

unusually strong with many outstanding aspects.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Director of Security

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Deputy Director of Security (IOS)

O'CONNELL, James P.

(Fitness Report)

Mr. O'Connell is completing ten years of Agency service and his

experience qualification includes four years of service with the Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree from

St. John's University.

This evaluation covers Mr. O'Connell's first year assignment

as Chief of the Security Support Division. It is felt that the outstand-

ing accomplishments of this Division during this period are in large

measure attributable to Mr. O'Connell's managerial skill. During

this time the Security Support Division, without additional personnel,

has increased its production substantially and in the area of operational

support has handled many unique and diverse assignments.

Mr. O'Connell has a keen and analytical intellect and a broad

understanding of the investigative and security problems inherent in

his job.. He applies these qualities with his talent for administration

to make for an overall outstanding performance.

Mr. O'Connell has the capacity for further development and

his future training should be directed to senior management courses

to insure the full development of this potential.
