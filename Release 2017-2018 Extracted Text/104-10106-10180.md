EMERGENCY INSTRUCTIONS

Instructions and procedures

are set forth below for the handling

of emergency situations such as fire, the escape or attempted escape

Of SUBJECT, and the sudden illness or serious injury to the SUBJECT.

Should such situations arise, it might be necessary to call on the

Police, the Fire Department, or outside medical facilities for assistance.

It is possible that in such an event representatives of the press or

curiosity-seekers in the local connunity might be attracted to the site,

thereby creating security problems with respect to the custody and

protection of the SUBJECT from a publicity standpoint.

In view of the above, it is therefore imperative that these in-

structions be thoroughly understood and memorized by all personnel

assigned to the Special Security Detail on this case.

FIRE

(Main House)

I. In case of fire in the Main House, the person discovering the

fire should apply the nearest fire extinguisher, unless, in his judgment,

the fire has reached such proportions where available equipment would be

useless.

Simultaneously, he should dispatch another member of the Security

Detail to alert the Senior Security Agent (SSA) and the other occupants

of the house. If no one is available in the immediate vicinity, the

person discovering the fire should alert others in the house by shouting

"FIRE".

2. Upon being notified of a fire, the SSA shall be responsible for

directing the fighting of the fire, protecting classified and sensitive

documents and equipment on the premises, calling the local Fire Department.

if circumstances warrant, and evacuating personnel. Also, at the first

available opportunity, the SSA should call the SAC or ASAC; or if they

cannot be reached, a senior DFO Agent, and furnish him with full particulars

concerning the situation and the action being taken.

3.

In utilizing members of the Security Detail in fighting a fire,

it should be borne in mind that two guards must be maintained on the

third floor at all times, so long as the SUBJECT remains confined to

his quarters. If it should become necessary to remove the SUBJECT from

his quarters during an emergency, a minimum of four guards should be

present unless circumstances are

such as to make this infeasible. In

any event, every possible security precaution should be taken during

the movement of SUBJECI, including the use of handcuffs or any other

restraining devices deemed necessary in order to maintain proper custody

and control over the SUBJECT and prevent his escape.

4.. If, in the judgment of the SSA, a fire has reached, or is likely

to reach, proportions that it could not be controlled by firefighting

equipment on the premises, it shall be his responsibility to notify the,

In this event, the Security Detail should

move with dispatch to remove the SUBJECT from the premises prior to

arrival of the Fire Department. The SUBJECT should be placed in an

automobile; accompanied by four members of the Security Detail, and

driven away from the premises. At appropriate intervals, telephone

If no answer is received, the

cognizant. DEO.official should he contacted for instructions as to whether

to return to the safehouse or proceca to an alternate site.

FIRE

(Tenant House)

1.

In case of fire in the Tenant House, the occupants thereof

should be instructed to immediately notify the Main House and to use

any available means to combat the fire until assistance arrives, unless

the fire is out of control, in which case all efforts should be directed

towards the evacuation of the occupants of the premises. It should be

clearly understood that in no case should any of the occupants of the

Tenant House call the Fire Department. This decision is the sole respon-

sibility of the SSA.

2. Upon notification of a fire in the Tenant House,

the person

notified should immediately inform the SSA and assist in the dispatching

of available personnel and fire extinguishers to combat the fire. If,

proportions that it could not be controlled by the available firefighting

equipment, it shall be his responsibility to notify the Clinton Fire

Department and to take necessary precautionary measures to prevent the

observation of the SUBJECT by firemen or other unauthorized persons who

might be attracted to the scene.

shots over SUBJECT's head followed by verbal warning to halt. In no

event, except in self-defense as stated above, will an agent shoot

directly at the SUBJECI.

4. At the first available opportunity, the SAC/DFO, or in his

absence, one of the ASACs, should be telephonically advised of all

the circumstances surrounding an escape attempt.

In no case shall

the Police be notified unless authorized by the SAC or ASAC.
