Background on Mexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverage.

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1955, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to 2a

exploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Phone taps were placed by an

Meters de de Tire bat,

who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines

tapped was linited

by availability of a listening post nearby

(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, ete) transcribers. Generally

these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and IDY ISD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices.

These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

Northlest corner of their compound and LIMITED was diagonally

across a double barrelled street on the southeast cornerf

that block. LIMITED was the first base ard it operated strictly on an

ex' erimental basis in the early stages. I think the Mexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to

be sure. Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the

public by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the same side of the street

as LIMIlliD but in the middle of the block south. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Mexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound

which the Mexico Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using

LIMOUSIND as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (who at that time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elementary level at

the American School).

was' run out of another ohe of these houses (crypt for the four houses was

LIMUST/1, etc).

This was handled by Glen WIDDEN (outside ISD officer) and

Mahoney using HQ TDY teams for monitoring. This operation was also separate

from LICALIA. The two houses in between were rented to unsuspecting tenants.

c. Mobile surveillance was developed by Anderson and later placed

under Mahoney and Joseph Sancho. This team consisted of a half

dozen

or so agonts who used three to four late model cars and a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera e).

The plan was to activate this group by radio (from LIMITED BASE)

Soviet

when someone of interest left the/Enbassy gate and stay with them

until they made their meetings. These agents knew about the LIMITED

BASE bedause they had LINITED photos for identification purposes.

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)

when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and

was arrested by the Mexican transit police and turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service. By the time the Station could arrange through

a cleared attorney to bail him out

the agent had identified Sancho (who was

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside....

phone nunber of Mahoney (who was subsequently replaced by Louis

Puckett). As a result of this flap, the LIFFAT project was broken

with which we dealt was a hip pocket group

spent a major part of its time on control of

foreigners and political investigations. Their agents were

vicious, venal,

corrupt extortionists.

Robert Melberg established contact with one of them

He gave them some

training (a group of about five surveillance types) in

Now and then, however, some useful

information vas developed but it could not be depended upon. Melberg was

by Jack Brady who found himself in the same pincer movement of having Scott

all decisions were made by Scott. This was about late 1961.

3. My memory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Embassy but I

think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New

Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a makeshift arrangement of volunteers

a.m. (passed by Flick to Goodpasture

to get to Scott before 9 a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which had

Russian

or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening

post the day

after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations among the embers of the Soviet Embassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling himself Oswald was

probably an Anerican.

However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were ricked up three times a week but the ones picked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis.

Photographs were made usually until one roll was used but

error did occur but generally the agents were conscientious.

The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipment (a pulse camera) but it

frequently developed rechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnardi and

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked u and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcripts every made in languages other than Spanish or English because Win

Scott could read only those two languages and he personally screened the

transcripts for operational leads he vanted pursued.
