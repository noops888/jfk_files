Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

:.:

1. (Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 7947) until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in(1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

consisted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobi

unveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFE

who

adied by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped was

suntited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance.

The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

street on the southeast corner of' that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base.

purpose of this opera

was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early (1959, due to the resig-

nation of

a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs

identification purposes.

In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LIENVOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and satellite En-

bassies in anticipation of possible covered The Station immediately

eafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three

Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line.

At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours and to

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulsé camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

1. (Undlateral) coverage. From the time the liexico Station was opened (in

(April 1947 (by Bill Doyle)) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1955, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to F

exoloit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Thone taps were placed by?

who was? handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The nunber of lines

tapped was Linited nly

by availability of a Ilstening post nearby

(since the taps were not made in the main central

and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czechy ete) transcribers. Generally

these agents (nostal a Meloan Avertead) vore rolated

(which the

hat time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b.. Three photo sites were handled by Arderson with the help

of Harry Nahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LINITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALIA). LINITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

Northliest corner of their compound and LINITED was diagonally

across a double barrelled street on the Southaas

that block. LIT was the first base aid it operated

strictly on an

si erinental basis in the early stages. : I think the lexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSIVE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart.

This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the

public by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved

to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street

as LEITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican farilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third photo site, was located

In one of a rol of four houses on the south a rele

of the Soviet Enbassy compound

about 1958 (check date), also using

LIOUSINE as the jurchager loheck). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Imbassy compourd. The purpose of this operation vas to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (who at thet time vere largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites vere handled by

Renon Alvarez (lexican citizen of U.S, mother who taught eleventary level at)

the American School). (Ramon collected the film enteri

etin from LNITED

and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husband, Carlos (Mexican doctor)

developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips. The master plan

the handler for all three photo bases.

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN.

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

and even then, they could not issue the visa here (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington.

Yet accordingly

(the American),

showed him a letter in which he the man

American) is a member of an organization im favor of Cuba

and said that the Cubans could not give hint the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Soviet doesn't know what to do

with him, because he has to wai

Washington.

DURAN:

che problem with him (the American)

is that he doesn

is very diffic

•give him a visa,

because he was

thinking of f

tessing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take a long time waiting for the Russian visa in

Cuba,

and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET:

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if;

she is

going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

permission,

for example, here or in any other place (he) can

receive

it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN:

.. certainly and neither can (the Cubans)

give him a letter

because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET:

DURAN:

SOVIET:

They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN:

It was no bother, thank you very much.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul.

He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory)

and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa,

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest..

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-representatives

for the boat "KALONIA"',

and needed routine visa information," First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned out to be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7. and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another

Soviet.

This

Soviet

tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as

a personal thing,

she has moved

and

has not advised them of a change of address

so will not receive

their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PRENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

SECRET

OCT 2 5 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including

some

from the white House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

FEL have detailed records

concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by. Bloc countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions

of DOID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been.

capable of provicing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East Duropean or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a Jist of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of. the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh So Cumming, JI.
