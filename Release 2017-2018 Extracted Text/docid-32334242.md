Re Jackson airtel to Director dated 8/5/66

and Jackson teletypes to Director dated 8/23/66 and 8/26/66,

captioned "INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITIES"; Bufile 166-1570

and 162-287.

On 8/4/66 JN 97-C advised that there is a great

deal of speculation along the Mississippi Gulf Coast as to

what will happen to those individuals recently indicted

along with HARRY BENNETT and others. The individuals

were speculating

as to how strong a case the government

has against the subjects and just who will "talk."

According

to the informant, individuals he has talked to feel that

the key government witness will be HARRY BENNETT,

who they

feel will "tell everything.

" BENNETT allegedly will do

this to save his son, ROBERTXBENNETT, because the "government

has him in a tight spot." HARRY BENNETT was also recently

convicted in Iowa on ITWI charges and is presently free

on bond pending appeal. There is also speculation that if

it were not for HARRY BENNETT, the government case would

not be as strong as it is now ole 2 - 9-

conversations with DEWEY D'ANGELO and his girl friend

would rather make guilty pleas rather than stand the cost

of a trial. They are, however, afraid that they might

"get the book thrown at them.

On 8/9/66 JN 10-C advised that he has learned

the crooked gambling equipment which was unearthed as

a result of the FBI raid on the Jack Kress Manufacturing

Co. at Tulsa, Okla., was actually being manufactured to

be sent to the various owners of the gambling casinos in

The owners of these various casinos

in Las Vegas had this equipment on order. Furthermore,

since JackkREss appears to be connected with the syndicate

miss

which operates Las Vegas

It was this Las vegas group

who hired attorneys JACK/WASSERMAN and MIKE MAROUN to

represent KRESS. According to the informant, the main

person responsible for obtaining these attorneys for KRESS

was CARLOS MARCELLO of New Orleans, La. (MARCELLO is the

reported La Cosa Nostra boss for the New Orleans, La., area.)

Furthermore, this informant stated he had learned

that both attorneys WASSERMAN and MAROUN had been

investigating the backgrounds of the two principal government

witnesses, namely MAURICE/ARNOLD and PAUL VICTOR BROWN.

BROWN presently resides in Las Vegas, Nevada.

This same informant advised that all gambling

on the Mississippi Gulf Coast has been shut down tight as

a result of the recent federal indictments as well as the

passage of the new Alcohol Beverage Control laws for the

State of Miss. It should be noted that any establishment

which houses gambling will not be permitted to serve liquor

on the premises. Several of the gambling establishments

have completely dismantled their operation and either converted

to a bar - restaurant operation or have closed their doors

completely.

JN 92-20

On 8/11/66 JN 238-PC advised that two lawyers

for JACK KRESS, JACK WASSERMAN and MIKE MAROUN, stayed

overnight at the Bel Aire Motel in Biloxi, Miss.

During

the times they were in Biloxi, they were in contact

with KRESS, DONALD LESTER/JAMES, IVAN ORRELS, and DEWEY

D'ANGELO.

They were possibly in touch with other individuals

also. These attorneys were allegedly planning a defense

to the gambling prosecution instituted by the federal

government. The rumor is that all concerned are worried

about HARRY BENNETT, whom they feel will "cop out" and

testify against the

other defendants.

On 8/23/66 all subjects of the indictment in the

HARRY BENNETT case appeared for arraignment before the

USDC at Biloxi, Miss.

All defendants pled not guilty and

were given periods of 30 to 60 days to file any desired

motions or pleadings. Trial dates in the above cases will

be set for a later date and all subjects were allowed to

continue on their present bond.

On 8/25/66 ROBERT ADAM BENNETT, son Of HARRY

BENNETT, a Gulfport, Miss., attorney and co-conspirator in

the HARRY BENNETT; ET AL case, advised Bureau Agents that

HASKELL FAJONES and CARLOS MARCELLO of New Orleans, La.

According to BENNETT, the conversation with HARRY BENNETT

indicated that the government witnesses, MAURICE ARNOLD

and PAUL VICTOR BROWN, definitely will not testify for the

government. Furthermore, the only other potential witness

for the government is ROBERT ADAM BENNETT. Attorney

WASSERMAN allegedly told HARRY BENNETT that it would be up

to him to "take care of ROBERT BENNETT." Implying that

if he did not do so, some other action would be taken to

accomplish this.
