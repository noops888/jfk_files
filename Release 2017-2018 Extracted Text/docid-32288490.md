is an informant of the Chicago

Division.

refer to the recent visit of WILLIAM G. HUNDLEY, Chief

Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, who was recently

in Chicago and could possibly be that person who is referred

to in this conversation as BOBBY KENNEDY.

There

is a strong possibility that the reference to furnishing the

"President all they got in writing" is probably a reference

to a recent letterhead memorandum prepared by the Chicago

Division containing all information available in that Division

pertaining to the situation surrounding the First Ward

activities.

In evaluating this information it has been noted

that the contacting Agent for this informant has not contacted!

him since the preparation of this memorandum and for that

reason there would be no possibility of that information

coming to LIEBERMAN's attention from the Chicago Office.

SORRENTINO mentioned in the conversation would be

identical to Judge PASQUALE SORRENTINO, who is also a close

friend of those persons within the First Ward organization.

To further substantiate the possibility of information

contained in the above-mentioned memorandum having been leaked

out is the fact that this individual is aware of the Government's

interest in the activities of certain judges within the Chicago

area which information has been maintained in an extremely

confidential manner even within the Chicago Division and it

is felt that the only possible way that this information

would be known would be through a leak from another source,

in this instance the office of the USA.

At approximately 4:30 p.m., 12/18/62, the individual

referred to as BILL in my airtel of yesterday, who was engaged

at. which time

the two individuals. This discussion was held in extremely

low tones and only minor excerpts could be obtained from the

source. From the limited amount of information available

it is known that this individual advised MARCY that his

telephones are not tapped at any point within the building.

Again due to the low tones used by BILL, it is pointed out that

the full context of the conversation could not be determined;

however, it is strongly felt that MARCY received no indication

from this individual of any possible microphone installations

within his offices. At the termination of their conversation

MARCY was overheard to state to this individual that "If I

overheard to

want any work done I will

get in touch with DICK and have

him get in touch with you."

This reference to DICK was felt

to be a reference to RICHARD CAIN, presently one of the top

investigative aides of Cook County Sheriff RICHARD OGILVIE

who is known to be associated with PAT MARCY as per previous

airtels.

A pretext telephone call was made to the Sheriff's

Office and a request made to talk to "BILL, DICK CAIN's

partner." It was determined that BILL was not in and under

further pretext it was determined that BILL WITSMAN is presently

CAIN's number one partner or aide. It is pointed out that

CAIN has a reputation

for being an excellent wire tap man and

in fact an article appearing in Chicago newspapers on 12/18/62

indicated that CAIN had recently made a check of phones within

the Sheriff's Office

a tre cite ana rese

and uncovered six tapped lines within

this building.

Chicago continuing to watch this situation

closely concerning the security of CG 6576-C*:

For the further information of the Bureau,

is CG 6283-C and is a practicing attorney with

office to CaSale where Chicago's First Ward

organization is located.

Jis also the attorney for

Anco Insurance Company with which D'ARCO and others are

connected and is also the personal attorney to PAT MARCY and

CHARLES NICOSIA, a member of D'ARCO's office staff.

LIEBERMAN

also shares office space with MARTIN GERBER, a former Chicago

AUSA, and is in frequent contact with D'ARCO and members of

his organization.

Because of this relationshipl

is in a

good position to know the comings and goings of

Chicago's First Ward organization as well as developments

at the USA's Office in Chicago.
