SUBJECT

: Chief, CI Stall

: Deportatios of Maurice Halperin

1. Attached da a copy of

in which

los guldance on their effort to deport Halperin. We dieçuesed this

on the morning of 12 September. During the afternoon of 12 Septem-

bor I received HMM-A-7904 which outlines the atalions' efforta to

bring about Haiperin's deportation.

You will note from (para 2 of HMM-A-7904) that

began'its effort on 21 August when LIKAYAK-& was aaked by a Medican

otileial for information on Halperin. It appears that|

went forward in an attempt to have Halperin deported without advising

Headquartera or the Legal Attache.

Thus, when it appeared from LIMEW's atatemento (ase

that ODENVY did not want American Communiots deported,

realised that it was working at croas purposes with the

Bureau since the station's efforts had been in progreas for almost

three wecks.

That the Mexican government le probally confused al thid

moment le indicated by the fact that Juatavo Djan Ordas (see para 8

of dispatch) who de la touch with Santillan, probably knows that

Sartillan de receiving information from LUKAYAK-2, who la known

to be in touch with the Americans.

whethor or not the Logal Attacho knows of our elfort to deport

Halporta. However, !! he does know, and if we go to him now to

say (as we decided yestorday) that we are planning an operation:

to deport Halperin, he could wall take tha position that he should

As of 17 June 1957 this covercge was discontinued because repairuen

of the telephone compony were in the neighborhood cleaning up old l1nao;

the tụo (2) extra lines into our basehouse had to be cut for security reasons.

It is not known when this coverage can be re-instituted; this depends

upon the departure from the area of the telephone repairmen.
