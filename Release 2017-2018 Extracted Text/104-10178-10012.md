Aírica Division believes that WIROGUE was recruited for his

Congo assigament because of his third country national background

in order to establish a support mechanism in Leopoldville. At the

time the Congo was in chaos, we had few assets there, and the

likelihood existed that the political situation would degenerate

suicidy. The Staton posalbly also wanted to have a latent paramilitary

capability. An October 1964 assessment of WIROGÚE indicates little

Lap potential with him since he knew little about the Agency. He spent

most of his time trying to develop contacts and was not directly involved

in any particular operation.

QJWIN

According to statements by a senior ClA officer in 1967, made

to lbe Inspector General, the Agency was instructed to develop a

capability to conduct assassinations. Termed an "executive action

capability, " such a project was initiated in 1961, apparently assuming

_ an existing cryptony, ZRRIFLE. At the request of the cáse officer

(the same officer providing this information in 196%), a clandestine

asset in Europe: QIWIN, was to be used in the project. The dare

officer understood that QJWIN had been considered in 1960 for use

in the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, but that the proposed

operation was never carried out because the designated CIA case

officer declined the assigament.

The case officer in charge of ZHRIFLE also was involved in an

operation to assagainato Fidel Castro, running from early 1962 ko

mid-1963. However, QJWIN was not used in this effort, reliance

being placed instead on a Cuban exile leader. SJWIN was never

briefed on the Castro Operation, according to the officer handling

ZRRIFLE and the Castro operation.

Records do show that AJWIN was dispatched to the Congo in

1960, being there in November and December 1960, prior to the

evidence to suggest that QJWIN was in any way involied in Lumumba's

demise. The case officer who was the source of the information of

the contemplated use of QJWIN in such an activity understood that he .

was never used in this manner. The following information reviews

_two Agency oflicers and was asked if he would undertake a trip 8o

2 November 1960, lists only Luxembourg and

He was not given the true objective of his mission because of ita

there originated at headquarters because someone must have

considered him qualiíled to handle a potential operation there.) The

that the mission might involve a large element of personal risk. We

follow suggestions in cable traffic on what approach QJWIN should use

of Janiary 1961, and it seema clear that QJWIN had left the Congo

La Decembies 1960. A 19 December cable to Leopoldville authorizen

his return to Luxembourg on 21 December and instructs Luxembourg

to pay him 1000 dollara for December salary, which is the final

payment for hia services on this operation. Also, headguarters was

working out the details of a Congo assignment. An 11 January 196!

headguarters memorandum, which refers to I/A's dated 21 December

1960, states that the referenced amounts were given to QIWIN by the

Chief of Station, Luxembourg. This suggests that QJWIN was in

Luxembourg on or before 21 December.

Subsequently, it appears that QJWIN operated in Europe trying

to spot and assess individuals whom the Agency could use in safe-

cracking operations, in line with one of the principal missions of

FI/D. A 24 May 1962 cable to Luxembourg mentions that a decision

was made to keep him in Europe and that the Leopoldville assignment

Agency officers who were handling QJWIN in Europe were almost

February 1962 in the appassination plot against Castro. An undated

(EYES ONLY) memorandum from the Deputy Director (Plana) refers

to a 19 February 1962 memorandur and authorizes the retention of

the services of QJWIN in activities which we have identified au

coincidential with the assassination plot against Castro. The date of

the reference memorandum coincides with the time that the senior

Agency official became actively involved in this enterprise. A

memorandum of 27 June 1963 dealing with the further handling of

QJWIN mentions that this enterprise has been terminated, except

for one precautionary "life line. "

In summary, it is almost certain that QJWIN had nothing at all

to do with the assassination of Lumumba, even though the contents and

language of available files are often cryptic and imprecise. If he had

been, it is highly unlikely that the number of Agency officers handling

and contemplating assignments for him would have been so large. The

mentions keeping him clean and using him in Dakar and possibly Milan,

which was specifically mentioned in the 13 October dispatch as offering

800d possibilities for finding safecrackers ánd document-suppliero.

Further, good tradecraft practices would dictate that the last thing

that would keep an individual clean would be involvement in an

assassination plot. Although the Chief of FI/D coincidentally was

later assigned responsibility for the Gastro operation, there ia

no ovidence to suggest that he was privy to assassination plota prior

to his brietng in late 196%.

While QJWIN was considered for use in the "executive action

capability", there is no information available to suggest that he had

ever been approached in this regard, much less used in any of the

planning.

Based on available evidence it seems clear that the Agency

was in no way involved in the assassination of Lumumba. However,

In the course of our research, two aspecis of the Lunumba story

surfaced that indicate Agency involvement in a plot. In the one.

Instance, our 1967 source mentioned the name of an Agency officer

who was designated as the case officer for an assassination plot

against Lumumba, but reported that he had declined the assignment.

That officer was the originator of a 19 December 1960 cable to.

Leopoldville in which he authorized the return of QUIN so

Luxembourg on 2I December to await further instructions and the

payment of 1000 dollars to him for his December salary by the

Luxembourg Station. The last paragraph of the cable advises

Leopoldville that headguarters is working out the details of a Congo

assignment for QJWIN. The same officer was the originator of a

31 January 1961 memorandum dealing with payments to QJWIN.

• In the second instance, a 17 December 1960 cable from

Leopoldville deals with the activities of a newly recruited agent,

WIROGUE, whose mission was to try to spot persons for a

surveillance team, intelligence assets (with emphasis on Orientale

Province), and paramilitary assets. The second paragraph of the

cable mentions that he resided in the same hotel as QJWIN (although

neither knew of the others CIA connection) and that he approached

the latter on 14 December with an offer of 300 douars per month to

participate in an intelligence net and to be a member of an "execution

squad." When QJWIN said that he was not interested, WIROGUE

added that there would be bonuses for special jobs. The cable

mentioned in paragraph 6 that the Station was concerned with the free

wheeling of WIROGUE, his lack of security, his inability to handle

finances, and his unwillingness to follow instructions. The Station

was willing to keep him on probation, but believed his recall would

In an attempt to reconstruct events, Africa Division was apprised

of the above and was asked to search its records in an attempt to

clarily what WIROGUE was up to in the Congo and his reference to an

"'execution squad. " The research did not clarify the matter to any

great extent, although some assumptions can be made on the basis of

circumstantial evidence. On 19 September 1960, two members of

Africa Division met with WIROGUE to discuss an operational assign-

ment in that division. In connection with the assignment, he was to

be trained in demolitions, small arms, and medical immunization.

In October 1960, a cable to Leopoldville stated that he was being
