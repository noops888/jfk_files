MEMORANDUM FOR: WH/ILI/ Panama

SUBJECT:

HIDALGO, Balmes

After several conversations with Mr. Hall of the Department

of Justice, the U. S. Attorney has decided to proceed without calling

on HIDALGO, even for preliminary interview. Consequently, no

further action is required unless we hear further from Justice.

Mr. Hall did say, however, that they might well have to reconsider.

and may want to call on us again.. I said we would make HIDALGO

available to their representative at any time in

but if the

reguest involved bringing HIDALGO to the United States we would

have to reconsider the whole matter at that time. My. Hall said

this was quite satisfactory and thanked us for our cooperation.
