the legitimate enterprises of the MANNARINO brothers and

particularly information concerning real estate transactions

involving SAMUEL MANNARINO; had advised during February, 1958,

that SAMUEL MANNARINO, during the early portion of 1957, mentioned

that he had purchased

on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Fields.

In connection with the aforementioned efforts ito identify

the location of the hunting lodge, the informant originally

To eng and in and meanin of a to ho brothe 215 -

the MANNARINO brothers,

that SAMUEL MANNARINO's hunting lodge is not located in

Somerset County, Pa., but is actually a twenty-room farm house

generally referred to as a hunting lodge, surrounded by approx-

the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, approximately a fifteen minute

drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland. The informant

recalled that he had been in the office of SAMUEL MANNARINO

during December, 1957, when the press and radio carried

the first accounts of

the fact that GABRIEL MANNARINO had been

called before the Federal Grand Jury in New York. He stated

that shortly thereafter SAMUEL MANNARINO received a telephone

call from GABRIEL MANNARINO in his presence and hurriedly

told him

"they are trying to serve you with a subpoena. Take

off for the brush."

The informant stated that it seemed

logical to him that if SAM MANNARINO's

remarks were interpreted

IIterally his advice could have been his subtle way of telling

his brother to proceed to the hunting lodge.

The aforementioned informant said that according to his

source of information, the general area surrounding the

lodge is thickly populated with whiskey stills, and that local

game wardens are reluctant to enter the area because some of

them have been mistaken for Agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco

Tax Unit and have been fired upon by the moonshiners.

The Philadelphia Office was requested, through the Recorder

of Deeds for Franklin County, Pa., to attempt to identify

the aforementioned lodge and to display photographs of

MANNARINO and LA ROCCA at Waynesboro, Pa., and vicinity near

the Maryland border to game wardens,

reliable police officers,

and other sources to locate the hunting lodge

and determine

whether MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding out in that locality

or have been there in the past six to ten months.

The New York Office advised on November 20, 1958, in reply

to a request to interview FRANK JOSEPH VALENTI, who is confined

to the New York City Civil Jail, that the New York Office believes

it inadvisable to conduct sÃ¼ch an interview inasmuch as there

is no indication that he would be willing to cooperate with

the law enforcement officers at this time. It was further

noted that there is no indication that he could be interviewed

with full security and that his interview might be subjected

to public notice. It was also advised that the activities

of those confined are being very closely followed by the New

York State Crime Commission, and that former Special Agent

JOSEPH MILENKY; Chief Investigator for that body, is advising

the New York. Office of pertinent developments.

JEK Act 6 (4)

The Baltimore Office advised on November 17, 1958, that Mrs.

3701 Clarinth Road, Baltimore, Maryland, advised

that she is the sister of MAX GOLDBERG, then personal accountant

for LA ROCCA, and that she is employed as a secretary in his

office.

She advised that GODDBERG is critically ill in the

New Kensington General Hospital and is suffering from an ulcerated

colon and other complications. She advised that doctors have

said that this illness could be fatal and if not, will cause

GOLDBERG to be incapacitated for some time. She stated that

she was certain that LA ROCCA had not contacted GOLDBERG or

any of the members of his staff in the recent past and that

if he does so, she will immediately contact the Baltimore Office

of the FBI.

C. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

I-5; who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised

that he has been unable to develop any information concerning

the present whereabouts of LA ROCCA. He stated that LA ROCCAs

associates have been very secretive of late, but that he has

an idea that LA ROCCA and GABRIEL MANNARINO may again be in Warren,

Ohio.

He again surmised that they had been hidden in the past

by CHARLIE MURGIE of Warren, Ohio, and that MURGIE had taken

them to Florida. He stated

that he had reason to believe that

they were staying close to home as he had learned that the wife

Of LA ROCCA is going to have an operation soon.
