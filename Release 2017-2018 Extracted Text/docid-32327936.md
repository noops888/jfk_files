KREITSEK advised that he is a close friend of ROCKY GRAZIANO

and during conversations with GRAZIANO, he mentioned the proposed

hotel.

GRAZIANO stated that he would have to include a casino

in the hotel and suggested that he see GRANELLO and LEVINE as

possible financial backers for this casino. KREITSEK advised

that he was introduced to GRANELLO and LEVINE by GRAZIANO at the

St. Moritz Hotel, Central Park South and 6th Avenue, NYC.

this time, GRANELLO and LEVINE advised they were interested in

the construction of a hotel in Havana, Cuba, and showed a

rendering of the proposed hotel to KREITSEK. They furthér

requested him to submit the rendering to the Sheraton Hotel

Corporation for possible consideration. KREITSEK stated that he

submitted

the rendering

• to the Sheraton Hotel Corporation and

various other hotel chains.

Following prolonged negotiations, KREITSEK advised

that the Sheraton Hotel Corporation displayed an interest in

the proposal of GRANELLO and LEVINE and sent KREITSEK to Cuba

to ascertain the complete facts. KREITSEK stated he travelled to

Cuba and was given the "grand tour" by GEORGE LEVINE, at which

time LEVINE showed KREITSEK the Oriental Park Race Track and

a considerable amount of surrounding land and stated that he and

GRANELLO owned it.

He further stated that they owned the Havana

Racing Corporation.

According to KREITSEK, the proposal looked good and he,

KREITSEX, recommended construction to the Sheraton Hotel

Corporation. After due consideration, the Sheraton Hotel

Corporation

accepted the proposal. At this point, KRELTSEK

advised LEVINE that he and GRANELLO would have to

"Completion Bond" prior to the Sheraton Hotel Corporation signing

any lease to occupy the hotel. LEVINE questioned KREITSEK as to

the identity of possible individuals who would post such a bond.

KREITSEK stated that one JOHN KEILLY of Jamaica, Queens, NY, hac

recently wrote an "Abandonment Bond" for the HITton chain when

no one else would write such a bond. For this reason, KREITSEK

recommended KEILLY to GRANELLO and LEVINE.

LEVINE that the Havana Racing Corp. would have to show assets

equal to the bond which would amount to five million two hundred

thousand dollars. According to KREITSEK, LEVINE furnished a

statement of assets in excess of the five million two hundred

thousand dollar figure to KEILLY. KREITSER advised that he

KREITSEK continued that KEILLY obtained a "letter of

commitment" to issue the bond from Gôdoy Sayan Insurance Co.s

This letter called for a "stand-by fee" of

$40,000.00, which would have to be posted by the Havana Racing,

Corporation. At this point, GRANELLO insisted on being named in

the letter.

LEVINE gave KEILLY $40,000.00 at the Waldorf-Astoria

Hotel in NYC and the later furnished LEVINE with,a "letter of

receipt"

written on the stationery of the Godoy-Sayan Insurance

Co.

Hotel corp..

accompanied KREITSEK to Havana,

cuba, where they

were met and given the "grand tour" by GEORGE LEVINE. BOONISAR

was pleased with the situation and fully accepted 'the proposal.

However, BOONISAR questioned KREITSEK concerning any possible

criminal background of LEVINE and GRANELLO. KRETISEK statec

that he asked LEVINE if the latter had

ever been arrested and

without any hesitation, LEVINE said that he had and for serious

offenses.

However, LEVINE stated that the names of legitimate

individuals would be substituted. in the contract with the

Sheraton Hotel Corp.

KREITSEX advised that he informed

BOONISAR of the situation and at this point, the enthusiasm

began to dwindle on the part of the Sheraton Hotel Corporation.

KREITSEK continued

that LEVINE wanted to know if the

Godoy-Sayan Insurance Co. had ever received the stanoby fee

KREITSEK told LEVINE that they probably had since he had a letter

of receipt. Subsequently, KREITSEK asked JOHN KEILLY concerning

this matter and KEILLY stated that he had given the money to the
