of World War II when it was necessary for aliens to register

PINDELLI was arrested by Warren, Ohio PD and held for

INS.

Inasmuch as the u.s. was

at war with Italy, It was

impossible to deport PINDELLI and he was placed

on bond

of $50,000, which was put up by members of the "organization."

When the, war ended and it appeared that PINDELLI's arrest was

Imminent, the "organization

indicated to him thathe should

take off

and skip his bond. He had apparently made satisfactory

arrangements with them, and he was not making enemies in

skipping the bond.

According to the informant, PINDELLI

then left Warren and traveled with a carnival based on

the West Coast through Calif., Oregon and Washington. PINDELLI

was later arrested at informant's brother, FRANK's, home

at South Gate, Calif., ard deported again to Italy.

later immigrated legally to Buenos Aires, where his brother

ANTHONY PINDELLI,

now deceased, was residing and where

PINDELLI remains

has nephews and nieces

residing at Buenos and, is residing

In connection with the influence of the Calabrese group

headed by ANTHONY MILANO of Cleveland, CV 314-C gave the following

as an illustration: He stated that in abous 1950 he backed a

sheriff's candidate in Mansfield, hoping that if he was elected

he would be able to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield

and within the jurisdiction of the sheriff.

The candidate was

elected without any support whatsoever of TONY MOLLICA. He

started his house of prostitution, which was a money making

proposition and shortly thereafter MOLLICA approached him and

told him that people in town were talking and saying that he,

MOLLICA, was responsible for the house being able

and It was giving him a bad name because "nembers" areperate

supposed to engage in prostitution.

Informant told MOLLICA that

he had nothing to worry about as he was not involved, and it

then became apparent that MOLLICA was trying to get part of the

operation and profit. MOLLICA then turned to MiKE ROMEO of

Poland, Ohio, brother of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell, Nho was a frienc

of Informant's father, and ROMEO called on the informant on

behalf of MOLLICA,

ROMEo told informant that he was

"out of line"

and was giving MOLLICA a bad reputation in that he had moved

Into MOLLICA's territory. ROMEO told CV 344-0 to close the house

for a couple of months so that everything would "cool" down.

Informant refused and told ROMEO he was not out of line and

secured his own "fix" by backing the sheriff in the election

and the sheriff wanted nothing to do with MOLLICA and would not

allow him to operate anything.

Informant stated he was mad

about this interference and then wrote a letter to his father

in Buenos Aires and later received an answer to the letter.

With the answer he was instructed to take the letter to

PINDELLI'S good friend, ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland, and

according to Cv 344-C, he did this.

to Akron to JAMES LA FATCH's home where about 20 persons were

assembled. After a dinner, all except informant retired to the

basement where MOLLICA and MIKE ROMEO were interrogated.

Informant advised MOLLICA lied and denied that he had said what

with such small details, and gave him the information, and

DE AUGUSTINI told him he would see that MILANO was advised.

He stated he

CV 344-0 stated that in Youngstown there are the same

two groups in the "organization" as in Cleveland.

The Calabrese

own ventures.

Both have respect for one another's enterprises.

The Calabrese is represented by DOMINICK MALLAMO, who is a more

Regarding the Sicilian' group of the "organization"

in Youngstown, CV 344-C stated he could not say if

VINCENT J. DE NIRO, bombing murder victim, 7/17/51, was

a member of the

"organization" or not, bus stated

that

DE NIRO's murders caused great concern among ell monters

of the

"organization"

He stated that of all of the murders

committed in the Youngstown area, this was the only murder

where members of the

'organization" made active efforts to

determine the persons responsible for same.

He cited inquiry

by PRATO, TRIPODI Of Steubenville and RIPEPI Of PG, as

DE NIRO was a big source of income for the group and was

cooperative.

CV 344-C stated that the "organization" made no

inquiry with him following the bombing-murder of CAVALLARO

and for this reason he believes CAVALLARO was killed for

getting "out of line".

He stated if he had been killed

without the sanction of the "organization" they would have

inquired as to wo killed one of their members.

He stated

that in his opinion CAVALLARO had a portión of Da NIRo's

operation and apparently tried to "hog" the entire operation

after his coach.

Regarding LAS PERS

the informant advised he

e is no longer held in

because he has gotten out of line"

by bad publicity and

by engaging in armed robbery and burglary.

He stated that

AIELLO had formerly been well thought of and in Youngstown

was on about the same level as ANTHONY DELSANTER presently

is in Warren.

Informant stated WILLIAM NAPLES, bombing-murder

victim, 7/1/62, was killed because the "organization" learned

he was

responsible for killing DE NIRO. According to the

informant, the NAPLES brothers were not part of either

the Calabrese or the Sicilian groups and did not contribute

to either group.

Regarding the killing of DMINICK MOIO, whose

body was found stuffed in the trunk of his car at Canton,

ohio, 9B/63, Informant stated the "organization" made no

inquiry about his death which would mean to him that

MOIO had "gotten out of line". MOIO had somehow obtained

employment

with the NAPLES brothers and unquestionably

"set up" BILLY NAPLES for his murder. CV 344-0 stated MOIO

he had driven BILLY NAPLES to his car when he was blown

up.

Re:

Steubenville "organization"

the Steubenville, Oble area and exerts some

certain sections of W. va.

He stated that as an example,

an "organization" member's' restaurant known as the

Baron Restaurant owned by COSMO QUATRONE was held up by

- some armed robbers from CV, including DAVE TIBERZIO,

THOMAS "LAUGHING TOMMY" RUDELICK, VINCENT INNOCINZI, Whose

body was found decomposed in Akron in the Summer of

1960,

and DOMINICK MAYRICI. The thieves had not checked with

TRIPODI before pilling the armed robbery and as

a result

INNOCENZI was kilied and MAFRICI although she son-in-law

Of FRANK DE AUGUSUINI DE CV. was killed in BU, 3/45/57,

while out on bond.

Informant noted that MAFRICI was

heard pleadins cor his

out "TONY don':" do It,"

lite prior to being shot

* calling

probably callirg to TONY BUFFA of

CV, who was the alleged murderer. Informant stated this

was an example of what the "organization"

considers getting

"out of line"

and anyone who does this will be punished

accordingly no matter who they are or how they are connected.

It is noted that the above info is not being

disseminated to other offices, inasmuch as it must be

paraphrased to such an extent that the informant cannot

be compromised at a later late. The info contained in this

communication will be evaluated and will then be disseminated

to interested offices.

Informant advised in connection with his father,

GUISSEPPI PINDELLI, three separate attempts have been made

to secure a visa for him the last being about two years ago,

when it was felt he was going to be allowed re-entry but failed.

He stated he is 77 years of age and would be kept by informant's

sister of excellent

reputation and with no possible burden to

returned he, being the oldest son, would be his chauffeur

she admitted knowing

ANGELINE CONSTANTINO, but denied that she had given

envelopes to CONSTANTINO at any time and further stated

of VINCENT DE NIRO 7/17/61, he met with CHARLES CAVALLARO

he matter any further with him as.. race meeting. however.

subsequently he met with CAVALLARO at Cicerois Restaurant

in Youngstown, several times and on each occasion' CAVALLARO

reiterated his demands concerning

the Campbell operations

stating that if they did not come across soon he was going

to "muscle in" on them. He disclaimed having any connection

with, or knowledge of, CAVALLARO's alleged control of

the barbut game in Campbell and stated that his name was

frequently associated with such activities because he often

would do favors for many of them by interceding on their

behalf when minor disputes arose.

for the "syndicate" as far as the rackets were concerned.

He stated that DI CARLO caused a "flock" of old timers from

various parts of the country to come into Youngstown, which

undoubtedly has been a factor in the overall confusion

of the racket leadership in Youngstown in recent years.

Informant revealed that then during the regime of
