the Departmental letter reflects this opinion was based

on information received by the Department indicating

that subject had been identified as head of the Inter-

national AntiCommunist Brigade and was present with

several of his men at a gathering of some 75 Cubans at

Davie, Florida.

The Department also referred to a

newspaper article appearing in the "Miami Herald" on

suby ndicating so indicating the herod to a parachute

jumps but only two parachutes were available. This

article stated subject had claimed his organization

consisted of 5,000 men, of which 700 are in training,

and that his organization includes paratroop groups,

underwater demolition teams, and others in educational

activities.

While the Department used the above data as

the basis for requesting additional investigation in this

matter, I felt that the data as furnished by MM-639-S,

a well informed and reliable informant, appearing in the'

Details of referenced report, sufficiently disproved the

exaggerated statements given by subject to the press as

to the strength and activities of his organization, and

that this data would have been sufficient for the Department

to render a prosecutive opinion.

As I have stated previously,

investigation has shown that subject is prone to exaggerate,

distorts the truth, is a liar, braggart, among other things.

I have previously interviewed subject concerning his

activities, at which time he was arrogant and evasive,

as reflected in my report dated April 24, 1961. It was

my opinion that to seek the subject out once again and

interview him concerning his activities would be repetitious

and therefore result in a waste of investigative effort.

This opinion I set forth in the administrative pages of

referenced report.

While the Bureau has pointed out certain

points which should have been covered prior to closing

this case, I respectfully point out that the information

furnished by MM-639-S in my opinion made coverage of

these points unnecessary.

I regret that the Bureau feels I should have

taken a different approach and broadened the investigative

activity in this matter.

In accordance with Bureau request,

I shall take the necessary steps to comply with instructions

as set forth in Bureau letter dated August 25, 1961, and

a report fully covering the activities of subject will be

submitted by September 25, 1961.
