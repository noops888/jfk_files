ANTHONY GIACALONE

AR

92-228

Informant stated that he would be well pleased

if the police department was able to convict and send

TONY GIACALONE to prison but he says he will wait and

see what happens.

He said GIACALONE had become very bis

in Sicilian gambling circles since 12 or 14 years ago he was

peddling the daily racing forms in prison to various bookmakers

.. Including himself.

He further stated he wondered if the

case would hold up in court for conviction since he road

the newspaper he did not observe any information that

Detroit Police Officer THOMAS had ever met GIACALONE in person..
