reconsideration of release of "good Kubark Asset"]: Board

upheld initial determination to release.

2.

Document Number 104-10017-10015 Request for

reconsideration/to technical error, marked Release in Full

by mistake. Board upheld initial determination to release.

3. Document Number 104-10052-10087 [Substitute

language issue/LICRYPT]. Board would not re-consider since

the 30 days deadline as

set by law had passed. Mary agreed

that this was a procedural problem; she was also caught off

guard by the Boards position.

In the future substitute

language will be provided on

timely basis.

The Board released only those names that

the Agency advised could be released. Action on Whitten has

been postponed until March 1996, the remaining names in the

documents under consideration at this meeting plus the names

in the documents for which we have received "Request for

Evidence" sheets have been postponed until the late January

meeting. Please provide addition information/evidence for

these individuals as soon as possible; in the future provide

the evidence for protecting a true name on the

"Request for

Evidence" for that document.

The documents with true names

pending will be tabled until a decision is made.
