A bank account for JOHN HOWARD LAWSON has been

located at the Highland Park Branch of the Security First

National Bank and Trust Company, Los Angeles, 5601 North

Figueroa Avenue, Los Angeles, California.

On 6/4/62, Mr: ROBERT CRIMLI of the Cashiers Depart-

ment, Security First National Bank's Main Office, advised

SA MARCUS M. BRIGHT, JR., that this account was originally,

opened in 1953 on referral from the Bank's branch in Van

Nuys, California.

JOHN HOWARD LAWSON, aka John Howard, or Sue Lawson, 948 Elyris

Drive, Los Angeles,

California. The account records note

with this a MARGOIS has power of attorney in connection

For the past year, according to Mr. CRIMLI, the

account has maintained a balance of between $1,000.00 and

$3, 000.00.

over

At the present date, the balance is a little

$1,000.00 and there has been no deposit or other

credit to 1t since January, 1961.

100-25130) whose CP affiliations have long been established and

who is currently
