were to be held in abeyance pending receipt by WFO of

pertinent details from Baltimore of a recording made by

DI. OSWALD BERRIOS for WFO's use in the interview.

On 12/7/60 the Bureau advised that a translation

of the recording was not pertinent.

In view of this and

in accordance with Bureau instructions SAS JOHN G. GOEDTEL

and JOHN L. SPURGERS, JR. called on DIMAS CID but she refused

to be interviewed by

the FBI.

to protest to the State Department, the violation of the

diplomatic immunity of DIMAS CID by members of the FBI when

they attempted to question her.

The Bureau was telephonically advised of the

situation, at which time Inspector DONALD E. MOORE

instructed WFO to discontinue all attempts to interview

the other Cuban officials involved in MARTINEZ' abduction

on 11/25/60.

In view of this, WFO has consolidated its cases

captioned "FELIPE MARTINEZ RIVERO, IS-CUBA" and "QUINTIN

PINO MACHADO, et al, FELIPE MARTINEZ RIVERO-VICTIM, IS-CUBA,

KIDNAPING."

The latter case has been closed administratively

at WFO.

The Bureau has been previously advised by airtel

dated December 22, 1960, captioned "FRENTE REVOLUCIONARI

DEMOCRATICO: (FRD), IS-CUBA," of information furnished by

WF 1161-SXoncerning a situation involving the subject and

ANGEL DE La CRUZ HERNANDEZ.

The Bureau will recall that

CRUZ,

a former Cuban G-2 agent, defected and joined the FRI

in Miami. The FRD gave him an

assignment to travel to

Washington, D.C. and contact the subject, which CrUz did

at the subject's home.

The subject apparently became

suspicious of CRUZ' credentials and summoned ARMANDO FLOREZ:

who was followed shortly thereafter by JOSE MOLEON.

After

the arrival of FLOREZ and MOLEON, the subject

again requested to see the identification paper belonging to

CRUZ.

This was then shown to FLOREZ and MOLEON, at which

point the subject stated there was "something out of order."

At this point FLOREZ, MOLEON, the subject and the subject/s

wife, MIRIAM drew guns and pointed them at CRUZ. CRUZ related

to the informant that the subject held a gun at

his chest and

stated he could kill CRUZ using as his story that CRUZ

threatened to assasinate the subject.

. The subject also

stated that he could get away with this because of his

immunity as a diplomat.

However, CRUZ related that

the subject stated he would let him go at this time and

if CRUZ was on the

level, he could come back to the

subject's home the following day and recover his identification

paper which the subject, at this point, took back from CRUz.

CRUZ stated that he immediately departed the home of the

subject and arranged to depart Washington, D.C. the following

day.
