Director

The purpose of this note is to inform you of

developments with respect to two confidential source-related

matters being addressed with the Assassination Records Review

Board (ARRB) â€¢

Discussions

with the ARRB regarding the Bureau's

postponements of confidential source-related information have

intensified during the past month.

our position, of course, is

that, in general, the identities of confidential sources, whether

they are living or dead, must be postponed to prevent harm to the

sources and their families and to the FBI's ability to develop

sources absolutely vital to our public safety and national

security responsibilities.

While the Act could arguably be

interpreted to reguire a particularized showing of harm with

respect to each postponement (a position being contemplated by

the Board), we believe that the Board has the discretion to

interpret the legislation in a way that supports the Bureau's

postponements of source-identifying information.

In various discussions with Board representatives, we

have

conveyed the FBI's absolute willingness to accommodate the

public interest in source-identifying information that is of

historical interest. This would be done by disclosing

information when"Tas was the case with the soLo source

information) disclosure will not result in harm to individuals or

to our source development capabilities.

At the same time, we

have emphasized our commitment to protecting the identities of

confidential sources who could furnish no information pertinent

to the assassination or where, while sources provided "positive"

information, their identities

record.

a post one to a - -10 2205-8186

provides protection for almost all source identifying information

in the first 590, 000 pages transierrea.

This is because there

appear to be few

instancesin which source identitiesare

important to the historical record. We have stressed to the
