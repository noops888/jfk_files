1. ACTION REQUESTED: PLEASE PROVIDE COS COMMENTS REGARDING

PROPOSED TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION DURING JYVAPOROUS/1 VISIT TO HQS;

PLEASE ADVISE REGARDING JYVAPOROUS/1'S AVAILABILITY FOR

FOR VISIT OF JYVAPOROUS/I (V/1-TO-HOS-CIRCA_22 JULY, WE WOULD

LIKE TO OFFER THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS REGARDING TOPICS

OF DISCUSSION TO BE RAISED BY EITHER C/PNINFINITE OR CHIEF/CE

DURING THEIR UPCOMING MEETINGS WITH V/1:

<-- LEE HARVEY OSWALD>FILES.

DURING PREVIOUS MEETINGS WITH

V/A. HE HAD OFFERED TO PROVIDE SUMMARIES OF GYVAPOROUS FILES ON

*<LEE HARVEY OSWALD>AND ALSO ALLOW "EXPERTS" TO EXAMINE DOCUMENTS.

WITHIN THESE FILES IN ORDER TO CONFIRM THEIR AUTHENTICITY. WHILE

WE REALIZE THAT RESPONSIBITITY FOR THESE FILES HAS BEEN TURNED

OVER TO NVAG FOR ACTION, WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR

THIS TOPIC TO BE RAISED AT THIS JUNCTURE, GIVEN THE LACK OF

ACTIVITY WE HAVE SEEN ON THIS SCORE-

-- PRESENCE OF IRAQI AND POSSIBLY IRANIAN MILITARY OFFICERS

IN

BELARUS.

DURING A 16 OCTOBER 1992 MEETING WITH DC/CETF/W, V/1

PROPOSED OPERATIONAL COOPERATION TARGETING THE CIRCA 100 FOREIGN

MILITARY OFFICERS PRESENT IN BELARUS.

OF THIS PRESENCE, V/1

MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY IRAQI AND ETHIOPIAN OFFICERS AND LEFT SOME

QUESTIONS REGARDING A POSSIBLE IRANIAN PRESENCE.

V/1 INVITED

PNINFINITE TO CONSIDER RECRUITMENT OPERATIONS, OFFERING

JYVAPOROUS FILES AND OTHER SUPPORT RESOURCES.

WE BELIEVE A

POTENTIAL JYVAPOROUS/PNINFINITE-JOINT-OPERATION-TARGETING-IRAQI

OR IRANIAN MILITARY OFFICERS IN BELARUS POSES SOME EXCITING
