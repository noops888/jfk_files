4. Operations.

On 13 and 14 January 1964, Phineas F. SLINKARD requested PARMUTH

to shoot movies of two BEDOX targets who were scheduled to meet at one of the

target apartments at 1500 hours on the above mentioned dates.

On 13 January,

one of the targets telephoned and said he could not make it but would be there the

following day.

(LIFEAT coverage). On 14 January, the target approached the

apartment building, rang the bell, and immediately left the building entrance and

walked down a block, giving his counter-part time to walk down three flights of

stairs to open the door for him. LIFIRE truck coverage did photograph the

Subject ringing the bell and leaving, but could not photograph the Subject walking

away because of obstructing traffic.

The target was also photographed running

through the door which was opened by another occupant of the apartment building.

To provide photographic and evidential confirmation of the date of this meeting,

RESCIGNO walked to the entrance of the apartment and read a local newspaper

which was also photographed. Three rolls of Tri-x negative film were used on

this operation. Forwarded as enclosure 2 is a copy of the film for Headquarters

b. On the early morning of 21 January 1964, PARMUTH and

RESCIGNO were requested by Lee R. MYLECHRAINE to photograph a meeting

between Oliver Q. WIMPHEN and a target who is a leader of a dissident factor

of the Mexican Communist Party.

An approach was made by WIMPHEN but he

could not guide the target to where this meeting could be photographed by the

LIFIRE truck.

5. Station Support.

a. On 2, 3 and 4 January 1964, PARMUTH was requested by

Michael C. CHOADEN to arrange audio communications between the LIERODE

basehouse and the LIEMBRACE team. LIFEUD/22 would use this equipment

when a selected PBRUMEN target departed by the front gate of the PBRUMEN

Embassy. L/22 was to notify the LIEMBRACE team to enable them to surveil

the target. During this period, PARMUTH kept in close contact with the

LIERODE basehouse.

On 9 January 1964, Lawrence F. BARKER and PARMUTH visited

the LIERODE basehouse to inspect the PULSE camera at BARKER's request.

While there, L/22 was in the process of building a new darkroom in the first

floor bathroom. The darkroom on the third floor was removed. A Pako drier

was installed on the third floor where L/22 and L/23 correlate, prints, and also

prepare their reports. Due to the additional work which L/22 has to service,

PARMUTH will meet with L/22 once a week. Forwarded as enclosure 3 are

photographs showing the new lab, the PULSE camera in operating position, the

Bal-scope with camera, and the Pako drier. See HMMA-22836 dated 31 January

1964 for photographs taken using the PULSE camera

On 16 January 1964, PARMUTH photographed 755 frames, using

the Recordak to fulfill a monthly Staff D requirement for the Chief of Station.

Station Support (SW activity).

On 25 January 1964, PARMUTH issued two 87 carbons to Philip S.

LAUENBERG which were given to VASLOUCH/1. A five-page SW message was

also prepared by PARMUTH using 58 ink. This message contained instructions

for VASLOUCH/1.

b.

On 29 January 1964, one message was received from LICHAP/1.

This message was developed by PARMUTH and given to Michael C. CHOADEN.
