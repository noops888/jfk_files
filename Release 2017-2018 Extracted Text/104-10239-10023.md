equated Zayote and "MONTENEGRO" (although SARAVIA waS

also part of the Zapote Operation) but checked with the desk

officer and with him agreed to develop the secret writing with the

SARA VLA developer.

personal meetings with the agents in El Salvador was Included in

the operational program for Zapole, but that meant an intermediary

or the case alicer going to al salyader for the contact. since

DALTON was out of El Salvador and other meins of communteadoa

was lost, DALTON was ordered to Mexico and the desk officer

arranged a trip there to get explanitiona of what had happened and

reestablish mall communication

When the desk officer went to

Merico for the meeting in March 1004; however; DALTON and

the other Salvado. ana he wanted to see did not show up.

allicer also wrote a still memorandum to PINEIRO complaining

about the quallty of the s/w oystems and training. His letter

was returned with an endorsement by PINEIRO saying that the

matter was being looked into and results could be expected. Up

to April 1064, bowever, nothing concrete had been achieved, ar

fur an the desk oilicer know; he heard nothing from LA and was

unable to resolve the matter directly with the agent in Mexico

because the agent never appeared for the scheduled meeting.

6. All agent sommunications from the fleld to accom-

modation addresses in Mexico or elsewhere are picked up and

forwarded through the field slation to headquarters without being

modation address there; the lette. was picked up and forwarded

to headquarters; when it had been developed at headquarters,

the desk discer informed the case ollicer in Mesico of the time,

date, and place set by in agent for the meeting.

flonal aros, the personal documents such do the cedula de
