HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U, S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

Reference is made to the letters to the Attorney

General from G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director,

HSCA, dated April 21, 1978,

and may 24, 1978, which requested.

In connection with the HSCA's investigation Into the assassi-

nation of De. Martin Luther kings 21,

that certain photographs

contained in the FBI Headquarters (FBIHO) file of that case be

provided.

In referenced letter of April 21, 1978, the HSCA

requested a copy of each photograph for which a negative

exists in the FBIHQ MURKIN IIle with certain exceptions.

This

request was later modified by the letter of May 24, 1978, which,

In Item 2, limited the photographs requested to forty-three

(43) designated by "Q" numbers corresponding to items of

evidence in the MURKIN f1le. This 1s to advise that included

as part of the attachment are all of the requested photographs

ach the exception of those designated 0-342, @-367; Q-392:

0-393, Q-394, Q-395, and Q-396, These photographs were not

located after a search of the MURKIN file including the bulky

exhibit folders.

With respect to Item 1 of the letter of May 24, 1978,

six composites were located that were prepared by the FBI.

Four of these composites were prepared by Bureau Exhibit

Specialists within ten days of the assassination.

The other

two composites were prepared in June, 1968, after Ray had been

identified and arrested In London, England.

As these two

composites do not appear to be pertinent to the fugitive

Investigation regarding Ray, they are not being provided per

the discussion with HSCA staff member susan Grimes.

As requested, the other four composites are being

Dear Mr. Attorney. General:

In the

course of the ongoing investigation by this com-

mittee into the circumstances™

surrounding the death of Dr:.

Martin Luther King, Jr.!

as well as related matters, it has

been learned. that Karl Prussion, publicly identified in the

late 50's as

an informant for the FBI, furnished information

on a regular basis pertaining to Dr. King and his alleged

•activities and relationship with the Communist Party.

"The Committee, being fully cognizant of the time period

during which this relationship was maintained - that being

1949 through 1958-and also completely aware of the potential!

volume of material compiled and maintained in various file

categories, both Headquarters and Field Office, over this period

of time, would therefore reguest that only the six volumes of

the Headquarters' informant subfile be prepared for access on a

priority basis for staff review.

As time is of the utmost importance, and no compliance

difficulties are anticipated, your prompt attention is solicited.

Sincerely,

Si Robis Blabe

Dear MI. Attorney General:

In connection with the Committee's investigation into

the circustances surrounding the death of DI. Martin luther'

King, JI., I wiite to request that you make certain field

office informant files available to the Committee so that

serious allegations involving the Federal Bureau of Inves-

tigation and the death of DI. King may be resolved. The

Committee has already had access to the relevant Bureau

personnel, and it has conducted extensive interviers among

those sho may also be subjects of this aspect of the com

mittee's investigation.

The focus of the committee's

Effort now is to determine if the written record supports

or refutes the oral testimony on the relevant questions.

These files have been denied to the Comrittee by the Director

of the Bureau by letter dated June 11, 1978, with the con-

currence of the Criminal Division.

I write

this letter to

ask that you give your personal attention to resolving this

serious matter.

of Understanding between the Department and the Select Con-

In a letter dateâ April 12, 1978, ProfesSor G. RODe JUL 18 1978

"the informant files on all informants in the Invaders

(See I.B. (1))

During the week of May 14, 1978, the Bureau, in partial

esponse to the april 12th request, permitted only Professor

Blakey to review the duly excised PBI Headquarters informant

Illes. The stati of the committee was denied access to the

files.

Professor Blakey agreed to this form of limited access,

reserving the right to insist that the terms of the Memorandum

of Understanding

be complied with.

In a letter dated May 23, 1978, the Committee then

requested "that the Memphis Field Office files for these

same informants be prepared for access by the staff."

Headquarters files contained basically administrative data;

it sas felt that the field Office file might be more en-

lightening.

The letter also observed, "while the Committee

feels that the procedure by which... (Professor Blakey) was

permitted access to the first set of files was unacceptable

and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending

further discussions to arrange to broaden access, this pro-

cedure may again be utilized."

It should be clearly understood that the Committee's

=I request for these files, as well

as the other informant

.= * files, is predicateá on

the precise language of the Memo-

Iandur of Understanding.

Section I.5. (2) of the femorandum sets out the

"Specific Rules"

by which access to materials may be ob-

* * tained.

Section I.B. (2), in pertinent part, provides:

Where... requested materials reveal the

identity of FBI sources who are or were

informants...Ihe D(epartment) of Justice)

will appropriately sanitize, including ex-

cising, it necessary, information identifying

such guerations, sources or informants. (Emphasis

addeé.)

The Honorable

rage 3

-ffin B. Bell

Under I.B. (2), the only matter at issue is the terms -

of access.

Denial of access is not contemplatea.

B (2)

clearly allows access to the files at issue, subject only

to propar sanitization. Nothing else is asked for here.

The Committee is fully cognizant of the issues raised

by the Bureau in its letter of June 13, 1978, in response

to our request.

It is, of course, recognized that a measure

of confidence in the Bureau's informant program would, in

fact, be eroded should it become general knowledge that

the FBI identified its informants in anything but extra-

ordinary circustances, where, unger the prevailing view,

they must be identified. See Roviaro v.

United States,

353 U.S. 53 (1957).

Nevertheless, all this is premature;

the Committee has not requested, as yet, that the identity

of these informants be revealed.

All that is requested is

access to the files, in order that serious allegations

involving the informants and the Bureau be resolved.

The Director's letter of June 13, 1978, offers instead '

of access to the relevant files, sworn affadavits denying

the Bureau's inforrants

acted as "agents provacateurs"

The

Committee feels that this procedure for resolving this issue

would be unacceptable.

As you know, with respect to the ring

investigation the Connittee is, in effect, perforring for

death of DI. Ring the same function that the warren Commission

performed for the death of President Kennedy.

One of the most

frequent criticisms of the viarren Commission is that in at-

tempting to resolve the issue of whether

or not lee Harvey

Oswald was an FBI informant, the Commission accepted sworn

affadavits from the Bureau.

The Committee feels, therefore,

that it is unacceptable in this instance merely to rely on

sworn denials without an opportunity to examine and cross

examine the relevant witnesses and to examine primary source

documents.

Our investigation must command the confidence of

the huerican people if it is to achieve its goals. Conse-

quently,

it will not be possible for the Committee to accept,

as the Director suggests, that this issue be resolved by the

taking of affadavits from the Bureau.

After noting that the allegation that the Bureau or

persons employed by it instigated violence is not new, the

Director's letter of June 13, 1978, denied the Committee

access to the files, referring to "overwhelming evidence

disproving the...allegation."

In support of that assertion,

the Committee

is told that "The Memphis Office aâvised that

these informants did not advocate nor take part in the

planning of any riot."

Next, our attention is drawn to the

Departrent of Justice 'lask Force's conclusion, stated in two

sentences of their report.

tion of DI. King.

HQ 134-11867; 270-1841;

170-1922; 170-2530, and 157-4885)."

From the Connittee's perspective, this "evidence" is

hardly overwhelming.

But that is largely beside the point.

Without access to this evidence, it cannot be evaluated.

Mere denials and conclusions cannot be accepted in lieu of

recoras and sworn testimony. The Committee has completed

the compilation of an oral record of the events that tran-

spired in Memphis during March and horil, 1968.

This record

consists of interview notes, testimony under oath before the

Committee, and witness depositions.

It is now imperative

that these witnesses' current recollections be compared with

the contemporaneous vritten record, particularly that con-

tained in the Iciciant informant files.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the Com-

mittee has attempted to move with restraint.

It was not until

our field interviews with former members of the Invaders and

people present in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968

march revealed: 1) that the Invaders were in fact a

proximate

cause of the violence, and 2) that it is universally believed

that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

FBI operatives that we requested access to any informant files.

By that time, the Committee had reviewed the Sanitation

Strlke, Invades, King and Southern Charter Leadership Con-

ference files. It had also reviewed the Memphis Police

Department files, and it had interviewed their undercover

operative within the Invader organization.

The Committee had initially hoped that the answers it

sought would be contained in the leaâquarters files.

are, as noted above, largely aâministrative, containing only

general information on informant reliability, payment of fees,

and justification for continuing the informant's status. They

do not contain agent instructions; they do not reflect in

detail the working relationship between agents and informants.

- From the Committee's perspective, therefore, the information

contained in the leadquarter files proved inadeguate. Sub-

sequent interviews with current and former agents have also

revealçô that:

the Hemphis Field Office had prior know-

ledge of impending violence la fact memorialized in PBI

documents) and 2) members of the Invaders were observed by

NW 55067 DooId 32989754 Page 40

agents of the FBI exhorting the crowd and readying weapons

Iron signposts la fact later testified to under oath by

these agents: Professor Blakey's review of the files

revealed-that at least one informant subsequently joined

a more violence-prone organization. You can see, therefore,

the reasons why access to the files, duly excised, is es-

sential.

I feel that this is a matter that can best be resolved

by our discussing the issues involvea.

Since the Select

Committee's investigation is in its last stage - our public

hearings will begin in August -- I suggest that you give me

a call this weel anâ we can meet as soon as possible to dis-

cuss this matter.

Chairman, House Select Committee On

Rayburn House Office Building

Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Reference is made to the letter to the Attorney General from

G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA), dated May 23, 1978, which referred to the FSCA's

access to "informant files of all informants within the Invaders during

1968." This reference is to five FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) informant

tiles which vir. Blakey reviewed on May 11, 1978. These files Involve

fIve informants of the Memphis office of the EBI who furnished information

on various racial matters during the approximate time of the assassination.

of Martin Luther King, JI., Including Information about the Invaders, a

Memphis youth gang.

Mr. Blakey was granted access to these files based on the

ASCA's request of April'12, 1978. Other than stating an interest in the

roles of these informants within the Invaders organization relative to

the activities of King, this request offered no other reasons for the

HSCA's need to review these informant files. However, based on a

discussion between Mr. Blakey and a representative of the FBI's Legal

Counsel Division, Mr. Blakey advised that the HSCA is trying to resolve

the issue as to whether or not the Invaders fomented racial violence to

get King to return from Atlanta to Memphis where he was killed, and 1f

any of our informants acted as "agent provocateurs" in instigating this

violence.

Honorable Louis B. Stokes

The allegation that our informants instigated violence is not

a new one. As disclosed in the FBI's file on the Invaders, this allegation

was reported in the media in February, 1976. At that time, files of

FBIHQ and the Memphis Office of the FBI were reviewed concerning the

allegation with negative results. The Memphis Office advised that these

informants did hot advocate nor take part in the planning of any riot.

This Information was furnished to the Attorney General by letter dated

Maich 4, 1976.

Further, the Department of Justice Task force reviewing the

FBi's assassination and security investigations of King concluded there

was no evidence that the activities of these informants related to King

or were in any way connected with his assassination.

Despite the overwhelming evidence disproving the above allega-

tion, this Bureau, in an effort to cooperate with the HSCA as fully as

possible and after very careful deliberation, decided to make the FBIHO

Informant files available only to Mr, Blakey with all informant identifying

data excised. This decision on the part of the bureau was not meant to

serve as a precedent for the HSCA to request the field office files on

the same Informants nor for that mattet to make available the files of

other informants which may be of interest to the Committee. If, in

fact, the purpose in

reviewing these files is to determine whether these

informants acted as "agent provocateurs, " this Bureau 1s more than

willing to fürnish a sworn affidavit denying this allegation.

In referenced letter, MI. Blakey stated the procedure by which

he was permitted access to FBIHQ informant files vas unacceptable. It

should be noted that Mr. Blakey agreed to these conditions, but prior to

the review, reguested that members of his stait also be given access to

these files, Because some HSCA staff members were familiar with our

substantive file on the Invaders, it was necessary to decline Mr. Blakey's

request since this knowledge posed an additional threat to our Informants'

identities.

As you can fully understand, the issue of permitting outside

parties to review informant files of the fil is a very delicate one.

It

is vital to protect our confidential informants because we may be dealing

with the lives and safety of these informants and members of their

families. If it becomes general knowledge that FBI informants' files

are being opened to outside parties, informant privilege 1s threatened

and our informant development program can be severely hampered. You can

appreciate that an Agent In the Field may be unable to develop a confidential

relationship with an individual if the agency involved cannot protect

the contents of that informant's f1le,

hit. Keuch

advised that, in the absence of additional information from the HSCA

bearing on the allegation that our informants acted as "agent provocateurs"

in instigating violence In Memphis, he concurred with our position on

this natter.

Sincerely yours,

Willfam H. Webster

Director

By Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum dated 4-27-78, it was approved

to allow Blakey access to files of informants who furnished information

concerning the Invaders.

This action was taken in hope of satisfying

the HSCA that our informants were not responsible for violence which

occurred during the Sanitation Workers Strike in Memphis. After Mc. Blakey

reviewed these files, as reported in Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum

dated 5-19-78, Blakey stated he found no evidence that any of our informants

acted as "agent provocateurs." However, he followed with an additional

request to see the informants' Field Office files.

Representatives of the Congréssional Inquiry Unit, the Legal

Counsel Division, and the Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit,

Criminal Investigative Division, are in total agreement that we should

go. no further to answer HSCA's demands for informant files in this.

matter and that Mr. Blakey's request should be denied. Mr. Keuch concurred,

based on discussion with D. O. Coulson, Legal Counsel Division, on

5-30-7.8.

On 6-1-78, SA Buryl Johnson, Memphis Office, was advised of

the above. Based on his knowledge of the situation, Memphis would be

willing and capable of submitting a sworn affidavit concerning this

allegation.

This letter completes response to HSCA's request dated

5-23-78.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

• By a letter dated April 12, 1978, the Committee requested

that staff be provided access to the "informant files of all

informants within the Invaders during 1968.

.. "

It is now requested that the Memphis Field office files

for these same informants be prepared for access by the staff.

While the Committee feels that the procedure by which I

was permitted açcess to the first set of files was unacceptable

and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending future

•discussions to arrange to broaden access, this procedure may

again be utilized.

It is my understanding that these files will be sanitized

only to the extent necessary to protect the identity of the

informants.

• Again, the Committee reserves the right to reguest the

production of the identity of the informants involved if such;

is deemed necessary to complete our investigation.

As time is extremely crucial in this matter, your prompt

attention in seeing that these files are prepared on a priority

basis is greatly appreciated.
