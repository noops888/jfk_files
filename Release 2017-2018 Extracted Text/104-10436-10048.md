now she thinks it is sonething more than that, it 1s a national thing

was evidently to shut him up

and they had better not say now that Ruby

commit the terrorist acts and then tryito make It appear that the acts

were done by the Commmists, that has always been the taotio and only

the people that, have no idea about politics can swallow those things.

been three principal developmentas 1) Amb HERMANDEZ Armas at 1839 his lest evening called

DORTICOS of Cuba. In this conversation, which Ilke the first is tared, DORTICOS expressed

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had interrogated Silvia about money.

ALVARADO, the Nio, was questioned by CAS officer until two &.m. this morning.

This

officer was Impressed by ALVARADO who has offered make himself available as a witness and

who is now hiding In place provided by CAS. We cannot guarantee ALVARADO's safety.

Wealth

of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities Involved with OSWALD In Cub Emb

ECHEVERRIA: that he had rearrested Silvin today because he learned she was attempting to

leave Maxl! for Habans, However, cheverria later told LEGAT thet he hid decided to rearrest

Silvin to avoid any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable as a

witness, Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI 7072 - pare 97 above)

we have not requested Mexi gor to take g any aotion against Silvia except to maintain

Echeverria Inter denied to LEGAT that he lad any

speolfio concrete evidence that she was about to leaye for Cuba. We do not now know which

Echeverrin statements are accurate.

It is quite possible, and even probable, that contre-

dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play down importance

of OSHALD visIt here.

Mext line st1ll| is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverrie stated to LEGAT that DORTICOS only Interested in finding

out whether Mosd authorities tried to pay a story from Silvia.

This is obviously Incrorrect

Interpretation. Neither:IOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's story.

but out of sickly fancy and a desire to get into the intel game. / We do not think it a

remarkable colnoidence thet both DORTICOS and ALVARADO talk about money paid to OSWALD.

For one thing, pay for an assassin is a faotor which immediately rises in the mind of

expert and layman alike. Secondly, DORIICOS may have heard through some Russian or Cuban

source in the Neil goverment that DURAN was asked whether the Cubans pald OSWALD for the

alleged assignment.

we do urge that Mexi place it and ALVARADO under the most searching scrutiny. His interro-

gators must probe deeply into his make-up and lend him back through the though processes

which may have led him to i make this possible mis-step. In securing confessiong of

OSWALD gave him a small tip of bne or two pesos. OSWAld carried his own luggage downstairs

and waited in front of the hotel with the luggage until RODRIGUEZ returned with the taxicab.

RODRIBUEZ, commented that while he had little difficulty

obtaining a taxi at the early hour,

It becomes very difficult to secure taxi transportation between 0730 and 0830 because of the

Direct HQS attention

this transcript. Note however. KOSTIKOV has dark| hair, YAISKOV light brown and very grey at

Could also well be that OSWALD first spoke
