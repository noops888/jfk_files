Task 336. On a nost discreet (stfictly arad-to-crow) basis,

•eiease is to submit a plas by 2 Icbruary on what it caa do to put

1 majority of workers out si action, unable to work in the case fielas

sad augar mills, for a significant periodiduring the remaiader of

Elis harvest. It is suggested that such planning consider non-letha

JW, insect-borne, introduced secretly to the target area by the

ravy. (2 i information for this planning can be obtained from vir.

obeft idwards at Ft. Ictrick, inaryland, and it. cordolus

noseyaks at Chi) she blas will roguire policy approval botore

implementation.

Tauk 33C. Sy 2 Iebruasy, Deiense is to subroit a plan for a

Car aiï-sea exercise in the vicinity of Cuba, in early arch. The

exercise is to have the appua-asse of an overt military activity for

the benefit of U.S. personnai and, if possibla, the improvament of

Hemisphere military relations by iaviting Latin Amarican observers

(like CLICPAC's highly successful weapons demonstrations). The

Cas there would be that this is cover for an invasion, with a plan

for "provocation'' which would justily U.s. response.

Tae overt

story makes it readily explainable as a normal l.S. military activity.

In addition to the timing factors imposed in mounting the operation

and in harvest dates, there is a political psychological factor, depend

ing in part on the CAS i2., results at Punta dal Iste, which further

imposes a need for a policy dacision prior to implementation.

Cir plan for exccution ia carly jarch, basud on ideas =eported to

transpoitation, car be used in paychological preparation to suppoit

the principle idea that we fcar an attack. )
