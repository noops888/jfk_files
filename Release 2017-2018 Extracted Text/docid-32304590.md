CONFTDENFIAL

RE: ARMA

SJ T-1 stated that he, as an official of the MOVIMIENTO

RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (Revolutionary recuperation Movement)

(Br) in puerto Rico, has in the recent past assenuled a listing

of some 475 youthful Cuban exiles presently living in fuerto Rico,

who had indicated to him that they are ready to fight in any

manner, at any time, for the liberation of Cuba.

His list

contains the names of some 40 to 60 former members of the Cuban

rebel army.

SJ T-1 advised It. MACEOthat he had to know more

about MACEO's plan before he could turn over any list of names

to him and, primarily, he had to be personally satisfied that the

movement by MACEO's group was just not another Cuban exiles'

dream but in reality a true military movement with no political

connection and a movement backed 100 per cent by the U. S.

Government.

SJ T-1 stated to Lt. MACEO that he feels personally

the military use of the men who

have volunteered their services to the MRR and he is not going

to let them enter into any military action inside Cuba which

has no chance of success from the very beginning; that is, a

military action without modern war equipment and supplies

which could only be furnished by the U. S. Government.

MACEO stated that he was not at liberty to disclose

what backing his group had but indicated that the military

plans of his organization called for the use of American

M14 rifles and Belgium "FAL" guns.

SJ T-1 stated that MACEO's

reference to the Mi4 rifles indicated to him that the U. s.

Government might be backing MACEO's group as such guns are

not available to the general public.

MACEO indicated a preference to the use of the Belgium

"FAL" guns as these are the same type of equipment presently

being used by CASTRO's forces, and if this group could capture

some Cuban arms and ammunitions they would be familiar with

the "FAL" equipment and could use any captured ammunition.

MACEO indicated that his group is becoming active

In Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Puerto Rico.
