GUS ALEX

The Swiss Central Police Bureau furnished the

following information received from the Cantonal Police in

Chur, Graubtinden, Switzerland:.

It has been established that ALEX stayed at the

Schloss Hotel in Pontresina between December 22, 1962, and

Note of Arrival No.

2450 Coway were sudiatalod in rosm 217 and 218.

Due to a misunderstanding by the Secretary of the

local Tourist Office, the Note of Arrival was classified

under the name of GOS. This was partly the reason why ALEX

could not be traced during the investigations carried out

between Christmas 1962 and New Years.

On the other hand,

this failure was apparently also due to the fact that the

exact whereabouts of ALEX were not known and that St. Moritz

and other winter sport centers in the neighborhood are usually

overcrowded at that time of the year.

It has also been established that ALEX arrived in

Pontresina on December 22, 1962, by car, possibly a "Volks-

wagen 1500, " registration

number LU (Lucerne) 29044.

During his stay in Pontresina ALEX had private

saling lessons by two local ski instructors and,

according

to the staff of the Schloss Hotel, he did not mix with other

guests at the hotel. His girlfriend was addressed as Mrs.

ALEX:

sh the hotel. Has car

She spoke English with an accent, as well as a

Bavarian or Austrian dialect. Members of the hotel staff

described her as 25-30 years of age, about 175 cm tall,

medium build, blonde hair, and attractive appearance.

The following trunk calls to foreign countries were

made by ALEX during his stay at the hotel:

December 24, 1962 - Athens No. 67.62.34
