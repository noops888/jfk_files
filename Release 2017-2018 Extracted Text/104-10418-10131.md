SUBJECT

NOSENKO Related Material (U)

1. During the course of the House Select Committee

on Assassinations

investigations,

various files relating

to the Nosenko case were provided by your offices fo

ISCA staff to review at Headquarters.

These files arc

identified by subject in the attached listing.

The files

are currently in my custody in Room 6D5317, OLC/HSCA.

2. Please review this listing and identify those

which were provided by your office,

where the files came from the outside,

those which should

properly be stored in your custody, and arrange to retrieve

the files. (U)

3. Much of this material may be soon requested by

FOIAers.

All of this material is covered by an agreement

between the DCI and Congress which requires that it be

retained, intact, for a period of 30 years.

SO,

do not

alter the files in any manner after you have retrieved

them until we have decided

upon a course of action to

fulfill this archival commitment.

That decision should be

reached prior to

the end of March 1979 and will probably

involve the copying of the entire file for archival purposes

after which the originals can be returned to active use. (U)
