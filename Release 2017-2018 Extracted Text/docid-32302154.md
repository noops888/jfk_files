The Miami Division is-reodested to advise San

Juan of the travel ofvany top functionaries so that they

can be observed in Puerto Rico.

For the information of Miami, JERONIMO ESTEVE

is identical to SJ 492-S, one

of the most prolific sources

in the cuban field in the San Jan Office.

He was asked

if he had made or plans to make a contribution

He answered that he has no plans in this regard and that

they cannot succeed because FIDEL CASTRO is too strong and

any revolution would lack the support of the U.S. government.
