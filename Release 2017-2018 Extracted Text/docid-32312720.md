SECRET

This report is being classified confidential in

order to protect the identity

of the informants of continuing

used therein and whose identity, if made known, could

beprejudicial to the national defense interests.

The deposit of $417.81 on 11/5/63, was reviewed by

SA LITILE and it was noted that

the deposit was made up

of

numerous personal checks in small amounts - apparently in

response to the appeal in the 10/21/63, BAFPCC newsletter for

funds to aid

the hurricane victims in Cuba.

The details of this report do not contain the

information furnished 5/9/63, by NY 2440-S* concerning the

allegation made by VINCENT THEODORE LEE tO TOM LEONARD in

Denver

that ASHER HARER skimmed five thousand dollars from the

BAFPCC film project and gave it to the SWP. This information

is not being reported due to the complete coverage that was given

to the BAFPCC film project, which was

indicated no malfeasance on the part of HARER, or anyone else,

the are of are of anyone eed and

in the handling of these funds.
