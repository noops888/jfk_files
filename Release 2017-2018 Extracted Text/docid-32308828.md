Latest informantinformation

indicates the betting operation at 3901 Toulouse Street is

presently being run by SALVADORE and ROBERT SAIA, who are

nephews to the late SAM SAIA. This betting operation was

formerly part of the old SAM SAIA operation.

Investigation

conducted under New Orleans file 165-628, captioned "BOBBY

SAIA; SAL SAIA; ITWI;" was consolidated into instant case

and

pertinent information is being set forth in this report.

On April 12, 1966, NO 1232-C-TE advised that BOBBY

and SAL SAIA are operating a good-sized horse and sports book

at a location somewhere in back of the American Can Corpora-

tion Complex.

They supposedly have a Western Union Sports

Ticker and will take a bet up

• to $200 to $500 on horse or

sporting events.

he said that they lay-off to SAM of PIAZZA

nd could very well be backed by DI PIAZZA. He believes that

SAL SAIA still works for the Times Picayune. He stated that

they get some very good intelligence information on horse

races throughout the country.

On April 20, 1966, informant advised that the

telephone number he uses to

contact the BOBBY and SAL SAIA

operation is number 488-3429.

On May 9, 1966, informant advised that FRANK CARACCI L4

definitely has assumed control of the old SAIA gambling

peration. He said that formerly a fellow by the name of

DIAMOND ROMANO used to handle the majority of the SAM SAIl

action; however, ROMANO is apparently no longer with the

SAIA organization. Informant stated that he was going to

approach ROMANO to possibly handle some stuff for the

informant.

On May 18, 1966, informant advised he felt that

FRANK CARACCI still is probably supervising the local

operations of some of the former SAM SAIA books.

On June 2, 1966, NO 1439-C stated that booking

establishment is operating out of the V & E Lounge on

Toulouse Street, but that the actual bookmaking operation

is not at the lounge but at an apartment located in the

immediate area.

She said that during the daytime the

bookmaking is in operation and

at night time it was her

understanding that some prostitutes work out of the

apartment.

Included in this is TOOTSIE KING, wife of

ROY KING,

BERNICE, the barmaid at the V & E, and a GWYNN (LNU).

Informant stated that BERNICE is the barmaid at the V & E

and goes with one of the owners of the bar whom she

'Stated is

known as BABY or FREDDIE.

She described this individual as a

white male,

40

years of age, 5' 8", 135 pounds, and gray hair.
