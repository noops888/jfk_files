CUESIA is a Cuban national who has previously

SEgRET

participated in CIA operations against the present govern-

ment of Cuba /HEMMING and COLLINS are American citizens:

mercenaries and revolutionists, who are not members of

any Cuban revolutionary organization, but are in constant

contact with most Cuban anti-CASTRO organizations in Miami

1962; LA BORDE, HEMMING and COLLINS went to Key West,

and on their return, claimed to have seen the CIA warehouse

and said it was full of all types of arms and ammunition;

burglarize it without difficulty. However, they plan to

wait until after they blow up the ship.XM)

The informant advised that on April 24, 1962,

CUESTA visited the Pier 3 area of the Miami Municipal Docks

to familiarize himself with theaarea and devise a plan.

CUESTA has decided to use an aqualung to attach explosives

to the ship. He claims to be an experienced diver.#m

Informant said that LA BORDE previously worked

on a subchaser owned by ALBERTO FERNANDEZ, which was of

operational interest to CIA, but has had no action in the

LA BORDE's burglarization of the CIA warehouse containing

arms, If the destruction of the ship were successful.$(Ms)

MARUCA agreed, and advised that CIA would notify local

law enforcement officials. (v)

Prior investigation concerning another matter

reflected

that the "SS WILLIAMS" is owned by TEOFILO

aube

BABOUN, a Cuban

Communist and anti-fiDEl CASTRo. The ship is gho Is anti-

millionaire residing in Miami,

presently on

a time charter to Inter Island Shipping Company, of which

VICENTE RODRIGUEZ is President and Manager.

The ship left

Miami on April 19, 1962 bound for Phillisborough, St. Maitin,

Netherlands West Indies, and is expected back in Miami on

approximately May 2, 1962.7(v)

The ship was described as being 750 tons, 167 feet

long, and Panamanian registry. EM)

On April 25, 1962, MARUCA said that LA BORDE was

then in Key West, Florida, owed the Blue Lagoon nine

hundred dollars on his bill, and the owner was going to

sign a complaint and obtain a warrant for LA BORDE's arrest.

On April 30, 1962, MM 639-S advised that CUESTA

has three aqualungs, and planned to teach HEMMING and.

COLLINS how to use this underwater diving equipment.

HEMMING, on April 27, 1962, talked to ALBERTO FERNANDEZ,

who said that LA'BORDE was in Key West, and HEMMING should

discontinue his association with LA BORDE, because of his

being irresponsible. CHEMMING said that he, COLLINS and

CUESTA were practicing with the aqualungs in the ocean at

Key Biscayne, Miami, Florida, on April 27, 1962, when

CUESTA said

whom CUESTA had previously known,

that, they were beins ghed by a cia agent

Informant advised that HEMMING has a friend

who is a ship surveyor, who was able to ascertain that

the "SS WILLAyS" woW be back to Miami, alorlda on.

about May 11, 1962.

The informant stated that CUESTA claims that

during the time he was working for CIA, ALBERTO FERNANDEZ

received a certain quantity of money from CIA, to be used

to buy food for the group operating a boat belonging to

FERNANDEZ:

However, FERNANDEZ kept the money. #ni)

Inasmuch as this matter concerning the blowing

up of the "SS WILLIAMS". is not within the jurisdiction

of the Bureau, and LA BORDE and CUESTA have previously

been of operational interest to CIA, and there is apparently

i11. Feeling between LA BORDE, CUESTA and CIA, the Miami

Office anticipates no active investigation in this matter.

The Miami Office will follow this matter through

[contact with MM 639-SJand liaison with CIA, and keep the

Bureau advised.
