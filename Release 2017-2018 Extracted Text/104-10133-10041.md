MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT

:

Roselli/Maheu Matter

l. This memorandum is for your information.

2. Reference is made to the 21 May 1975 memorandum from

Mr. Scott D. Breckinridge, which outlines his review of the

Department of Justice files on the Roselli/Maheu matter.

The undersigned reviewed referenced memorandum and

discovered an apparent discrepancy between the Office of

Security files and the Department of Justice files.

Para-

graphs 9 and 10 of referenced memorandum reflect that the

Department of Justice records contain a 22 May 1961 report

of an FBI interview with Colonel Sheffield Edwards.

During

this FBI interview, Colonel Edwards allegedly stated that

"only Mr. Bissell and two others in CIA" were aware of the

"Giancana-Maheu activity" and that "Allen Dulles was com-

pletely unaware of Edwards' (sic) contact with Maheu in this

at aviars and

connection."

Office of

Security files reflect that Mr. Allen

Dulles

had approved the entire operation against Castro, thus

inferring that he would have been aware of plans to approach

Robert A. Maheu, et al.

J.C. King, and

James O'Connell.

5: The above is provided for your information should

discrepancy surface during the current inquiries into

this

matter.
