de Mena, Dominican Consul General, Washinston, D. C., than he

had with De Noya and Ginebra. Informant stated that Ironcoso

accepted

a luncheon engagement at Deane's residence for

February 18, 1961. The invitation included De Moya and Ginebra

and it was stated that the purpose of the invitation was so

that the individuals involved could talk privately.

WE I-3 subsequently advised on February 18, 1961, that

Deane was in contact with Walter Surey (fornerly registered with

the Department of justice as an agent of the cominican Republic)

and advised Surrey that De loya, Troncoso and Ginebra would be

at his residence that date

for lunch. In answer to

a question

from Deane, Surrey stated that Representative (Cooley)had apparently

told De Moya and Ginebra that it was getting increasingiy difficult

to hold to his present position. Representative Cooley) had asked

the Dominicans

stated that representative Cooley believes that the best he can

quota. The Dominicans and

Representative Cooley discussed the "election laws" and the

Dominicans told Representative (Cooley) that the recent elections

in the Dominican Republic were orderly and well run.

Deane asked why Representative (Cooley) wanted the

vominicans to confer with Representatives Poage and Thompson.

Surrey said that Representative Poage) is the person who has

supported Representative (Cooley) and Representativa Thoupson is

interested in the problem. With regard to this, Deane commented

that the Dominicans did not desire Deane's presence at the meeting

with Representatives(Poage )and Thompson which he felt was "just

Attached is a memorandum which contains additional

details concerning developments in this situation.

You-will

note that the Dominicans, although not optimistic, continue

to make every effort to line up support for their position.

In this regard, one of the sources in the enclosure

(WF I-1) advised on February 19, 1961, that Marco de Peña,

Dominican Consul General, Washington, D. C.,

was in contact:

with Ambassador Virgilio Diaz-Ordonez, Dominican Delegate

to the Organization of American States (OAS).

Diaz-Orflonez

felt the Dominican Republic needed a "point of support" in the

United States Department of State since the Dominican position

is completely dependent upon the attitude adopted by the

United States in the OAS.

Diaz-Ordonez felt that what

Igally is needed is the active friendship of some official

in the Department of State who can act to "moderate or

kHuntil the present United States attitude. He mentioned that

"Bill'" (last name not given) used to be in a position to

pocomplish this but has now lost out "almost completely"

asia result of the defeat of ex-Vice President Richard Me

The possibility exists that "Billy" may be

Sidentical with William D. Pawley, President of the Miami

and former United States

Ambassador to Brazil.

previously in this situation,

According to Diaz-Ordonez, it appears that

Ginebra

and "the others" are approaching the point of

view

adopted by Diaz-Ordonez with respect to the Dominican

Republic's position in the OAS.

In this connection, it was

stated that an individual by the nane of Billy (last name

not given) had been consulted; however, Diaz-Ordonez felt

that this person was completely untrustworthy and an

opportunist.

Ginebra

apparently agreed with Diaz-Ordonez that

the place for Dominican action was within the OAS. Diaz-

Ordonez flatly stated that the Oas is nothing more or less

than a branch of the United States Department of State.

Diaz-Ordonez ielt that the Dominican Republic needed a

"point

of support" in the State Department since the Dominican

position is completely dependent upon the attitude adopted

by the United States in the OAS.

He felt that the main

trouble was the fact that the United States presently is the

most aggressively anti-Dominican member of the OAs.

He

added that the recent statement by United States Ambassador

Philip Bonsal epitonizes the whole problem since it sets

the entire "OAS mood."

Informant stated that Dizz-Ordonez enumerated with

qualifications and reservations Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina

as najor OAS members favorably disposed toward the Dominican

Popublic. He listed Haiti, Guatemala and Paraguay as being

inclined

to support the Dominican Republic provided that the

aggressive attitude of the United States is moderated. Diaz-

become more moderate, the above six countries might be willing

to give some' support toward the withdrawal of AS sanctions

against the Dominican Republic.

It was ielt by Diaz-Ordonez that what really is

needed is the active friendship of some official in the

United States Department of State who can act to "moderate

or blunt" the present United States attitude. In this

regard he commented that Billy, mentioned above, used to be

in a position to accomplish this; however, Billy has now

lost out "almost completely" as a result of the defeat of

Richard M. Nixon.

Diaz-Ordonez commented that Billy now

has his hands full trying to recuperate from his loss and

regain esteem in the eyes of the new administrztion. It

was the opinion of Diaz-Ordonez that Billy will leave no

stone unturned in order to accomplish this. Due to this,

Diaz-Ordonez felt that Billy is untrustworthy.

Informant stated that Diaz-Ordonez said that the

Dominican Republic has some friends in the OAS but these

friends withdraw when approached for aid at the present time

with the observation that this is a gigantic task and in

effect amounts to an attempt to manipulate the United States

Government itself. The informant stated that in conclusion

both Diaz-Ordonez and De Pena agreed that the "question of

the hour" would be resolved one way or another on February 20,

1961.

^ On February 19, 1961, VF I-2, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that an individual

known only to the informant as Arthur was in contact with

Asuncion' Ickert, Administrator, Dominican Sugar

Office,

The informant stated that ickert asked

1961, between peesentative Harold Cooley, North Carolina,)

developments up to that point and in his opinion "the die is

He did not feel that anything would be accomplished.

Monday, February 20, 1961. Arthur disagreed by stating that

it was

his understanding that Representative(Cooley) was

awaiting a communication from the Administration.

He clarified

this by revealing that he had attended the "Sugar Club"

Representative Cooley introduced are an a vh statements

concerning "which way

the wind was blowing."

Based on these

statements, Arthur felt that Representative (Cooley)was avaiting

"some sort oi communication from the Department which puts in

writing what they said to him at the conference."

ackert stated that she had seen Representative Cooley

alone "the other day" and Representative Cooley had explaine

the "whole thing to her."

Eckert had explained

to Representative

Cooley that she did not teel that she should take the full

responsibility and had therefore taken De Pena with her to meet

with Representative Cooley) the following day. according to

Eckert, De Pena also had reservations and because of this

and due to Representative Cooley's suggestion that he must

meet someone with whom he could "talk turkey," the "three

men" came from the Dominican Republic to meet with Representative

Cooley.

Arthur vas of the opinion that the Dominican Republic

would get only its regular sugar quota.

Eckert desired to

know Arthur's opinion as to who the recipients of the non-

quota allotments would be. Arthur indicated that "Lariy"

desired the sugar but anyone who knows what has been going

on and under the present circumstances would not get mixed

up in the matter.

Arthur indicated that due to this, he would

not become involved and he thought it was coolish that

contract with the Dominican Republic under the present

circumstances. Arthur indicated that he could not consci

that the Dominicans were crazy to "throw money away like

.that."

The informant stated that both Arthur and Eckert

were unfavorably impressed with Deane and Ickert stated that

De Pena could not "stand him." It was obvious to the informant

that ickert was not aware of the fact that Deane is registered

with the Department of Justice inasmuch as she commented that

Deane should register because he "goes around as our representative

and counselor."

At this point, Arthur stated that "the cards have.

been stacked against Trujillo." It was the opinion of Eckert

that it was Trujillo's "own lault." Arthur agreed and lamented

the fact that the Dominican Republic wastes money by hiring

"these disreputable individuals."

Arthur compared this with

is monted

the "waste of money" involving Alexander L. Guterma and the

Mutual Broadcasting System wherein Trujillo paid Guterma

$750,000 to transmit favorable information regarding the

Dominican Republic over the Mutual Broadcasting System

network.

Arthur indicated that the situation as it presently stands

angers

bim.

With regard to Deane, Ickert expressed the opinion

that Maltely Surrey (a Washington attorney formerly registered

as an agent of the Dominican

Republic) was the individual

responsible for putting Deane in the picture." Eckert doubted

that Deane possessed the "pull in Congress" he. is reputed to

have. Arthur agreed and

stated that Representative (Cooley

"doesn't even know him."

Arthur was of the opinion that the answer to the

problem of the Dominican Republic was in the United States

Department of State. According to Arthur, even Lavrence

Myers, Director, Sugar Division, Commodity Stabilization

Service, United

States Department of Agriculture) does not

know how the problem will be resolved. When Ickert expressed

surprise at this statement, Arthur stated that he felt the

Department of Agriculture was "not in on it yet."

Arthur

further indicated that Adoll Berle oi the United States

Department of state was "the guy" and at the moment is "ix.

with this observation.

With regard to Mr. Berle

stated that he was "no friend of the Domivicans."

At this point Arthur stated that he felt that

Representative Cooley had thrown

"some darts at Mc. lann

when he was talking

' to Dean Rusk" (Secretary of State).

Arthur stated that it was his opinion that when conferring

with Mr. Rusk, Representative (Cooley had let it be known

that he did not want policy in this matter set by Mi. Mann.

Arthur stated that he was presently handling

affairs for the Puerto Rican-American Refineries and indicated

that this organization wanted to "get started in Florida."

Arthur vent on to say "that fool should be dumping some of

his money in Florida." Arthur opined that if Trujillo bad

any capital he wanted. to invest in the United States he

could not do better than invest it in Florida with regard

to sugar. Eckert commented that she understood that the

Cubans were doing this.

On. February 19, 1961, VF I-3, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that Deane was

in contact with Ginebra. Informant advised that Deane

inquired whether Ginebra had been able to see "some of the

Ambassadors today and some of the other people."

Ginebra

commented that this had been impossible but stated that on

Tuesday, february 21, 1961, "we have a meeting with some

people in the evening." Ginebra indicated that they did

not know where the meeting would take place or even the

identities of the people they would see; however, he did

state that Deane would attend the meeting.

The informant

stated that Deane was pleased to learn that he would also

attend the meeting.

Subsequently, on February 19, 1961, VE T-1

advised that Ginebra was in contact with an official of

• the Dominican Republic identified to the informant only

as Virgilio.

Ginebra reported that he was in Washington,

D. C., and had talked with Generalissino Rafael L. Trujillo

on che morning of february 19, 1961. Ginebra stated that

he informed this person that "ve are fighting."

On February 21, 1961, a confidential informant who

has furnished reliable inrormation in the past advised that

Eddie Lopez iisanda, President of Lamborn Sugar Company,

99 Wall Street, New York City, and Michael B. Deane (registered

with the Department of Justice as an agent of the

Dominican Republic), had discussed generally the situation

with regard to the sugar bill recently sent to the United States

Congress by President Kennedy®

Deane stated

the basic quota

was still unchanged so he felt thai although the situation

was bad it could be worse.

Lopez stated an Associated

Press or United Press International dispatch had appeared in

a Mexican paper stating that one million tons or sugar were

being

held in reserve for allocation to cuba in the event

there wasne, chinge in United

States relations with that

countryo

Deane, stated he had heard nothing concerning this

as it

for the above situation.

THis igame source subsequently learned on February 21,

Dominican officials who have been visiting Washington, D. C.,

were makingaplans to depart Washington, D. C., on February 22,

196% in order to go to New York city,

Troncoso did not

naw how long they would be in New York City but he mad

plans to see Lopez on the morning of February 23, 1961.

source, therefore, assumes Mx. Pawley uses his infivence in

American Government circles to advance Trujillo's interests.

This data apparently refers to William D. Pawley, former

United States Ambassador to Brazil, whose

In addition, the source commented it is rumored that

a brother of Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower, wife of the former

President, owns

considerable stock in the Dominican sugas

industry,

which is owned by Trujillo. The source, therefore,

suspected this individual, whose name was not known to the

source, possibly had some

part in securing the extension of

the purchase of sugar from the Dominican Republic after

sanctions by the Organization of American States were placed

in effect against the Dominican Repuolic.

The above possibly refers to Mrs, Eisenhower's

brother-in-law, Colonel Gordon Moore, who was mentioned

by Drew Pearson, the columnist,

in his daily article

which appeared in the March 6, 1961, issue of the "Washington

Post and lines Herald."

According to our source, Ginebra laughingly stated that

Ar. Cooley definitely had been in the Dominican Republic

but he did not elaborate further.

Deane also revealed

another mistake was in the article in that it indicated

$94,549.20 had been paid to him for a six-month period.

According to Deane, the sun was correct; however, it as

to be paid over an eighteen-nonth period ending in

December, 1961.

In addition to the above, on April 6, 1961, we

received the following information

which way possibly have

some relation to Dominican lobbying activities in this country:

A source who is in a position to furnish infor-

mation concerning certain Dominican activities in the

United States advised that Ginebra had received authorization.

to spend $50,000 to redecorate the residence of the

Dominican Consul General. The source advised that no one

connected with the Dominican Consulate could understand the

reason for such expensive renovations. However, the informant

speculated that Generalissimo Rafael L. Trujillo, as the

Dominican Representative to the United Nations, might come

to the United States in that capacity and the above residence

is being renovated in the event Trujillo visits

3 Hashington, D. C.,

while in the United States.

This same source learned, during the past week, that

Ginebra had made an inguiry relative to obtaining a quantity

of United States currency in denoninations of one thousand

and five hundred dollar bills. Ginebra indicated he vanted

more than an amount of $10,000 or $15,000. The source

speculated that the money being sought by Ginebra may be

personal funds which he possibly has brought to the United

States

in the event he desires to seek asylum in this country in

the future.

The source has recently heard fron a third party

that Ginebra has made the statement he would seek asylum

in the United States it recalled to the Dominican Republic.

DOMINICAN LOBBYING ACTIVITIES

INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC:

REG'D-READING ROOM

The following data of possible interest has been

developed

as a result of our continuing coverage of this

situation:

кожу

You have previously been advised of the reaction of

the Dominicans to a letter received from the Department indicating

that the Dominican Sugar Office and

its personnel are required

to register under the provisions of the Foreign Agents

Registration Act of 1938, as amended.

In that regard, we have

leaned that Mrs. Asuncion Eckert of the Dominican Sugar Office

on April 5, 2961, made arrangements to confer with Arthur to

Quinny a

Washington, D. Co, attorney, regarding

her having to

register with the Department as an agent of the

Dominican Republic.. She indicated this request for her

registration had

been made by the Department because someone

had "denounced" her,

In this same regard, Quinn contacted MISs Eckert

on April o, 196%, and informed her that he had received

SOMM-FEL

a copy of the April 13,

issue of "The Reporter" magazine

1ti5'i

MAILED

which contains an article entitled "Our Sugar Diplomacy.

According to Guinn, the article takes Representative Harold Do

Cooley of-North Carolina "over the jumos" and describes

1961

Manuel de' Moya, Dominican Secretary of State without Portfolio,

and Oscar: Guaroa Ginebra, Dominican Consul General, Washington,

Co, as lobbyists.

Quinn stated the article disclosed that Michael B.

la registered agent of the Dominican Republic) had been

hired by the Dominicans "last August"

and had received

$94, 549,20

for a six months' period according to the records whol

of the Department of Justice.

Also, with respect to the above article, it was

that day Deane informed his wife that, since he (Deane) was

mentioned in the

article, he felt he

should "retire from the

public scene for a while," His wife disagreed and stated

that he should not feel guilty.

It was also learned on April 6, 1961, that Deane while

discussing the article with Ody H, Lamborn of Lamborn and

Company, Incorporated, New York City, remarked that the

article

was "pretty factual." Deane felt there was so much

activity by the Dominicans on Capitol Hill that the newspapermen

could see what was going on and this resulted in the story.

Deane said he had warned Ginebra regarding his traveling to

Capitol Hill too frequently and in doing so pointed out that

in the

Summer of 1960 "they" had been effective and no one had

known "they were operating.!

Deane further remarked that the story in "The

Reporter" pinpointed

their activities and contained some

"unfortunate quotes."

Later, on the same date, 1t was

learned that

Ginebra discussed with Deane the matter of registering

the

Dominican Sugar Office.

It was Ginebra's opinion that he

should remain aloof from the registration procedure, but

planned to have Mrs. Eckert register as chief of the Office.

Ginebra stated he wanted the registration papers completed

as soon as possible in order that they might be sent to the

Dominican Republic for approval.

In addition to the above, it was Learned on

April 5, 1961, that Ginebra had informed Eddie Lopez Miranda

and Ody H, Lamborn of Lamborn and Company, Incorporated,

sugar brokers located at 99 Wall Street, New Yock City,

that he, Ginebra, planned to attend the luncheon of the

Miranda informed

Ginebra

that Brazil,

Taiwan, Australia and Mexico would be

allotted twelve minutes each at the luncheon to present their

position in the sugar market, but added he felt nothing

really important would occur. Miranda then offered to contact

Ginebra after the luncheon, at which time

he would. furnish

Ginebra the results should Ginebra not attend. Ginebra

requested Miranda and Lamborn not to send information concerning

the events at the luncheon to the Dominican Republic until

Ginebra requested De Moya to

inform the

"Chief"

(Generalissimo Rafael L Trujillo, that

Ginebra had visited the United States Department of Agriculture

the previous day and had made an appointment there for

April 4,

with "our öther friend" (not further identified).

COMM-FBI

ith regard to the above data indicating that

Ginebra had an appointment at the Department of: Agriculture

on April 4, 1961, we learned that Mrs. Asuncion Eckert of

as he believed the Dominican Sugar Office would have to

Heroted that both firs. Eckert and Ginebra had

been mentioned specifically as having been "up on the Hill"

and Deane

felt that "someone around this town is trying to

hurt us."

Subsequently, on April 4, 1961, we learned that

Deane informed Ginebra that he (Deane) had been in contact

with Nathan Bo

Lenvin, Chief, Registration Sections Internal

Security Division, Departnent of Justice.

Deane stated that

Lenvin had been infomed that he (Deane) had discussed with

a letter received by Deane from Lenvin as well as

Deane's conversation with Lenvin on April 3, 1901.

Deane

indicated that he told Lenvin the Dominican

Sugar Office

• would register and that hrs. Eckert would file a "short

statement* as the head of the Dominican Jugar Office.

Deane stated he informed Lenvin that Ginebra had

never engaged in lobbying activities; however, Lenvin had

indicated he felt Deane had previously intimated Cinebra

had been so engaged.

Deane advised Sinebra that he

informed Lenvin he did not think Ginebra should register

as Ginebra had merely been making courtesy calls within

the scope of Ginebra's duties.

According to Deane,

Mx. Lenvin accepted this but indicated it might be

necessary to submit the question to the Depariment of

State for a decision in the event other information was

obtained indicating Ginebras

activities were more

than mere meetings with friends.

In addition to the above, it was also learned

on April 4, 1961, that Ginebra had

attempted to contact

another source who has

furnished reliable information in the past made available the

following data on May 25, 1961, which appears to be of interest

to you:

Our source stated he had just learned from a highly

placed Dominican orticial that resident kennedy has beer

"sending out feelers" concorning the possibility of resolving

differences between the Dominican Republic and the

United States.

This Dominican official clained that the above

had been told

to hira by Generalissino Rafael L. Irujillo, who,

in substantiation of the information, had also said that

person "very close" to President Kennedy had just recently

craveled to the Dominican Republic for this purpose.

according to the Dominican official, Trujillo had

aso intorned that this matter was being coordinated by

President Kennedy's younger brother (not further identified)..

Our source expressed the opinion that, if the above

information received any publicity or circulation among

Dominican exiles or the people or the vominican kepublic,

cheir opinion of the United States would be lessened

considerably.

efforts should

be made to democratize the Dominican Government.

On june 2, 1901g

relayed to her husband:

Senator Smathers insists that he wants a "specific

basis" for assisting the Dominican Republic when the Senator

and thereby "passing over the head" of Adol Berle of the

Department of State®

Senator Snathers has also insisted that

free elections be held in 1962

•that the tas be permitted to

observe these elections, and that a democratization process

take place in the Dominican Republic, Ine Dominican Government

he wished that

shas commenced action in this regara,

Surrey felt that "ve" must help him

"through it."

a query fion Gallagher, surrey stated that he did not belleve

there would be any later repercussions.

It was the opinion of

Surrey that the matter would have succeeded a year ago.

Gallagher was in greenent with this but stated that "ye" could

not do anything with the State Department a year ago..

According to Surrey, Berle felt that he had inherited

the problem at which time surrey told Berle that he could not

run from the problem.

Surrey had pointed out to Berle that the

people who are presently advising Berle on matters are the ones

who had prevented "it" a year ago. Berle had requested that

Surrey specifically identify whom he had in mind at which time

Surxey had stated that the

individual responsible was "irs hiann."

indicated that hann was a close friend of his; however, surrey

felt that Mann should be sent "to the licld."

to Mexico but lamented the fact that Mann would not

depart for

the new post for six more months.

She felt that Mann was going

to wait until he was successfui in getting "this thing through

Congress and all louled up."

Boil Gallagios and ickert expressed sympathy and liking for

commented that Ironcoso would likevise join i the meeting with

In, view

of the above, Eckert stated that she

• had not mentioned anything

to Ironcoso regarding what had taken piace in a previous meeting

Eckert had with Representative

mentioning this was the fact that sie did not desire to nake

Ironcoso feel worse.

It was pointed ou by Gallagher that

Representative @tal had not indicated to Jo jora or Gincora

-that he was aware vi the presence of Ironcoso in Washington, D.C.

Gallagher indicated that she also mould be in autoncaaca

at the meeting between Representative sue and the Dominicans

on February 20, 1961, and stated that She planned to greet

Troncoso cordially :in front of them." She desired to do this

in order to show these individuals how nuch respect Ironcoso

¿clena, Dominican Consul General, Washinston, D. C., than he

intoriant siated that Ironcoso

accepted a luncheon engagement at Deanc's residence for

February 18, 1901. Ine invitation included de loya and Ginebra

and it ras siated thai the purpose of the invitation was so

that the individuals involved could stall privately."

WF I-3 subsequently auvised on february 18, 1961, that

Deane was in contact with walter Surey (formerly registered vich

the dopartient of justice as in agent of the socialcan Republic)

and advised Surrey that de Moya, Ironcoso and Ginebra would be

at his residence that date for lunch. In answer to a question

from Deane, Surrey Stated that Representativecast had apparently

told De Moya and Gineira that it was getting increasingly difficult

to hold to his present position.

Representative eas

a had asiced

the Dominicans what they could do to "improve things."

Surrey

stated that representativaesarat believes that the best he can

do is maintain the present basic quota.

The Dominicans and

Representative c

say discussed the "election laws" and

l the

Dominicans told Representative.

#that the recent elections

in the Doninican Republic, were orderly and well run.

Deane askud why Representative

wanted the

Dominicans to confer with Representatives

and sins.

Surrey said that representative

eit is the person who has

supported ropresentative m

sat ard Representativaa

interested in the problen.

With regard to this, Deane conmented

that the Dominicans did not desire Deane's presence at the meeting

with Representatives

and it which he felt was "just

•as well."

Deane wondered whether in the neeting of February 17,

1901, "the other subject" was discussed. Surrey stated that as

far as he knew it had not been discussed.

not given) had been consulted; however, Diaz-Ordonez felt

that this person was completely untrustworthy and an

opportunist.

Ginebra

apparently agreed with Dizz-Ordonez that

the place for Dominican action was within the OAS. Diaz-

Ordonez flatly stated that the Ous is nothing nore or less

than a branch of the United States Department of State.

Diaz-Ordonez felt that the Dominican Republic needed a

"point

of support" in the State Department since the Dominican

position is completely dependent upon the attitude adopted

by the United States in the OAS.

He felt that the main

trouble was the fact that the United States presently is the

most aggressively anti-Dominican menber of the OAS.

He

added that the recent statement by United States Ambassador

Philip Bonsal epitonizes the whole problem since it sets

the entire "OAS mood."

Informant stated that Diaz-Ordonez enumerated with

qualifications and

reservations Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina

as najor OAS menbers favorably disposed toward the Dominican

Republic.

He listed Haiti, Guatemala and Paraguay as being

inclined

to support the Dominican Republic provided that the

It was felt by Diaz-Ordonez that what really is

Arthur agreed and lanented

the fact that the Dominican Republic wastes morey by hiring

the "waste of money" involving Alexander I. Guterna and the

DOMINICAN LOBBYING ACTIVITIES

IN THE VITTED STATES

INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

On February 21, 1961, a confidential informant who

has furnished reliable iniormation in the past advised that

Eddie Lopez Miranda, President of Lamborn Sugar Company,.

99 Wall Street, New York City, and Michael B. Deane (registered

with the Department of Justice as an agent of the

Dominican Republic, had discussed generally the situation

with regard to the

sugar bill recently sent to the United

States

Congress

• by President Kennedy.

Deane stated the basic quota

was still unchanged so he felt that although the situation

was bad it could be worse,

Lopez stated

an Associated

Press or United Press

International dispatch had appeared in

a Mexican paper stating that one million tons of sugar were

being held in reserve

for allocation to Cuba in the

event

there wasre, change in United States relations with that

countryo

Deane, stated he had heard nothing concerning this

and

stated-chers was no provision in the

sugar bill as it

preSEntLy stands

for the above situation.

THis game source subsequently learned on February 21,

1961, that Jesus, Maria Ironcoso and Oscar Guaroa Ginebra,

Dominican officials who have been visiting Washington, D. Co,

were makingsolars to depart Washington, D. C., on February 22,

1962,

in order to go to New York City. Ironcoso did not

knaw how long they would be in New York City but he made

plans to see Lopez on the morning of February 23, 1961.

Additional investigation in this matter has

•. developed that Ironcoso and Ginebra actually departed

Deané indicated he

would have to strnighten Ginedra out in this regard,

noting

he does not think it is a good ldea for Ginnira do ba

"running around alking to all these people."

On March 4, 1961, Deane was again in contact with

Surrey at which time

Deane

expressed concern over the manner

in which Ginebra is operating on his own without consulting

with Deane and Surrey.

Deane exoressed his feeling: that

It 1s imperative he and surrey continue to control the :

sizuation between representative

and Ginebra so they

will

not find themselves in a position where Ginebra will

feel

their services are unnecessary. In this regard, Deane

Iemarked that Ginebra had asked him to introduce Ginebra to

various people "from

the White House on down,"

It has also been learned that on March 4;

1961, an

individual by the name of ClifE McIntyre (phonetic) contacted

Lawrence Myers, Director, Sugar Division, Department of

Agriculture, stating he had heard a report Cuban sugar is

being refined in Canada and then shipped into the United States.

Myers stated there is truth to the rumor and in in iscompersa

introducing an amendment which will take care of the

situation,

On March 5, 1961, a Mr. De. Pena (phonetic), who is

not identical with Marco de Pena,

former Dominican Consul

General mentioned above, advised

Ginebra he and Salvador

Sotomayor (phonetic) have been negotiating with the

Japanese and have almost reached a sale of 100,000 tons of

sugar to them.

It has been determined that Ginebra on March 5, 1961,

contacted Manuel de loya, Dominican Secretary of State

• without Portfolio, who was in New York City meeting

to the United Nations.

in private business

be able to watch out for Dominican interests.

In this regard, the

The source said he did not see the check in

question, but was told of its existence by a friend in the

Dominican Republic who held and may continue

to hold a

position in the Dominican Budget Bureau,

This money

reportedly was paid to senator. Smachers to secure irom him

a laudatory speech on behalf of Generalissimo Irujillo

which vas given by Senator

yat an assembly of the

Dominican Congress.:

This

same source advised it'is assumed to be a

fact in the Dominican Republic that Mr. William Pawley of

Florida, who has oil concessions in the Dominican Republic,

also represents boch the interests of Generalissimo Irujill

and MIe

Pawley's personal friend, Senator me The

source,

thererore, assumes Mr. Pawley uses his intluence

American Government circles to acvance Trujillo's interests.

This data apparently refers to William De Pawley, former

United States

Ambassador to Brazil, whose

name has previously

come up in this situation.

In addition, the source commented it is rumored that

a brother of hrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower, wise of the former

President, owns

considerable stock in the Dominican sugar

industry,

which is owned by Trujillo. The source, therefore,

suspected this individual, whose name was not known

to the

source, possibly had some part in socuring the extension of

the purchase of sugar from the Dominican Republic after

sanctions by the Organization of American States were placed

in effect against the Dominican Republic.

The above possibly refers to irs, Biserhower's

brother-in-law, colonel bordon moore, who

was mentioned

Mission to the Organization of American States (DAS),

Washington, D. Cos on a number of occasions.

During

conversations with

these officials, he has stated in

substance that he is the nephew and legal advisor of

Senator siste

henders, and that the

Senator desired him (Cartwrighi) to contact the Dominicans

in order to have an important message transmitted to

legislation.

On March 23, 1961, Michael Deane, at the

request of Dominican Consul General Ginebra,.

According to our source, Ginebra laughingly stated that

Mr. Cooley definitely had been in the Dominican Republic

but he did not elaborate further. Deane also revealed

another mistake was in the article in that it indicated

$94,549.20 had been paid to him for a six-month period.

According to Deane, the sun was correct; however, it was

to be paid over an eighteen-nonth period ending in

December, 1961.

In addition to the above, on April 6, 1961, we

received the following information

which nay possibly have

some relation to Dominican lobbying activities in this country:

A source who is in a position to furnish infor-

mation concerning certain Dominican activities in the

United States advised that Ginebra had received authorization.

to spend €50,000 to redecorate the residence of the

Dominican Consul General.

The source advised that no one

connected with the Dominican Consulate could understand the

reason for such expensive

renovations. However, the informant

speculated that Generalissimo Rafael L. Trujilio, as the

Dominican Representative to the United Nations,

might come

to the United states in that capacity and the above residence

Is being renovated in the event Trujillo visits Washington, D. C.,

while in the United States.

This sane source learned, during the past week, that

Ginebra had made an inguiry relative to obtaining a quantity

of United States currency in denominations of one thousand

and five hundred dollar bills. Ginebra indicated he wanted

more than an amount of $10,000 or $15,000. The source

speculated that the money being sought by Ginebra may be

personal funds which he possibly has brought to the United States

in the event he desires to seek asylum in this country in

the future.

The source has recently heard fron a third party

that Ginebra has nade the statement he would seek asylum

in the United States il recalled to the Dominican Republic.

In that regard,

on April 5, 1961, made arrangements to confer with Arthur L.

register with the Department as an agent of the

Dominican Republic,

mentioned in the article, he felt he should "retire from the

His wife disagreed and stated

that he should not feel guilty.

It was also learned on April 6, 1961, that Deane while

discussing the article with Ody Ho Lanborn of Lamborn anc

Company, Incorporatad. New York City, remarked that the

article was "pretty factual."

Deane felt there was so much

activity by the Dominicans on Capitol Hill that the newspapermen

could see what was going on and this resulted in the story.

Deane said he had warned Ginebra regarding his traveling to

Capitol Hill too frequently and in doing so pointed out that

in the Summer of 1960 "they" had been effective and no one had

known "they were operating.""

•Deane further remarked that the story in *The

"unfortunate quotes."

With regard to the current Doninican situation,

we have received the following information which appears

to be of interest to you.

On June 5, 1962, we learned that Oscar Guared

Ginehra, Dominican Consul General, Washington, Do Cos

informed Michael B. Deane, a registered agent of the

Dominican Republic,

Rubirose arrived in New Fork City on June 4, 1951, on

"personal business" but was not visiting the United States

as o "special envoy."

Ginebro also informed Deane that

Doninicon Foreign Minister Porfirio Herrero, Boes was then

in Washingtong

Do Cos having arrived on June 4, 1951.

Deane conmented thay Herrera Buer was "obviously the special

envoyo"

Mith regara to Porfirio Pubirosa mentioned aboves

we have previously received information from & source vino

has furnished reliable information in ine past that Fbirosa

•¿s an agent of the Dominican Military Intelligence service

(SIl) in as every special category."

This source advised

that whenever Fubirosa arrives in the Dominicon Republic

after having traveled abroad. he is given the

ired carpet"

¿reaiment and his specialty is to influence people in

influential positions in joreign governments in a manner

savorable to the trujillo regime.

we have also learned that Deane informed Ginebra

He continue to receive information regarding contacts

on the part of Dominicons with officials of the United States

Government. In this regard, the following date of possible

interest has come to our attention:

You have previously been inforied that Oscar Guaroa

Ginebra, Dominican Consul General, Washington, D. Co, had

advised imbassador Virgilio Diaz Ordonez, Dominican Delegate

to the Organization of American States (OAS), that he has

hopes it obtaining an additional sugar allotment for the

Dominican Republic.

It was indicated that possibly some of

the countries receiving sugar allotments would be unable to

fill their quetas and, in that event, he might be able to

obtain an increase in the Dominican allotment. In this

regard,. we learned that on July 3, 1961, Ir. Laurence Hyers,

Director of the sugar Division of the Department of Agriculture,

was unable to keep his appointment with Ginebra on

that date.

Later on the same day, however, hir. Hyers was in contact with

Ginebra. At that time Ginebra reportedly mentioned. that he had

Learned that the Philippines nod been granted: 150, 000 tons of

if there is any chance of the Dominican Republic "éntering this

market" if other countries that have received reallocations are

unable to fill them.

JUL'

According to our source, ir. lyers indicated that

there is c possibility that 10, 000, 000 tons of sugar could be

shipped to the United States if all of the allocations were

fulfilled. Ir. Hyers added that in the event that should
