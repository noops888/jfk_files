The following information is Included on the admin-

istrative pages because

PH 614-C-TE is Involved in the matter

in a manner which it is not possible to conceal.

The information

was obtained from him by SA JOSEPH A. VERICA, 3/17/62.

At a time, which source was unable to remember

exactly but when the Magglo Cheese Company was in its old

vicinity of 54th Street and City Line Avenue, Philadelphia,

had been arrested by Captain CLARENCE J. FERGUSON, Philadelphia

Police Department, on a narcotics charge and had been held

for court by Magistrate BENJAMIN SEGAL.

MARIO MAGGIO asked the source to make some kind

of contact with Captain FERGUSON and get the case "washed."

Through a cousin, NAT FRANK, Who

writes a column,

"Frankly Speaking," In a local newspaper,

"The Observer,"

and

who has numerous political connections at City Hall,

the

source met Captain FERGUSON at the Venice Grill on 12th Street

and discussed the MONTALBANO case.

FERGUSON was agreeable to an arrangement, but said

he must have $7,500, $2,500 of which was to go to the attorney

who would defend MONTALBANO, and FERGUSON said that would

have to be JOSEPH ALESSANDRONI.

This was agreeable to MAGGIO, but the trial resulted

in MONTALBANO being placed on probation.

MAGGIO felt that

rinally agreed that he would accept $5,000

original $7,500.

This money was obtained by the source from

MARIO MAGGIO and delivered in a paper bag to FERGUSON at

the

Venice Grill shortly after the trial. FERGUSON took the bag

to the basement,

where he presumably counted it, returned, and

said everything

was all right.

The informant did not know the significance of the

as it appears a sum of money is collected each month to defray

loan,

a debt,

or to

Philadelphia Office will trace ownership of a

representative number of identified vehicles listed above

to determine if all were purchased from the same source and

if BRUNO has proprietary interest in that source.

SONNY RICCOBENE, who bankrolled the game; FRANK SINDONE; "JOE GIBBONS;"

JOE LA ROSA; FRANK NARDUCCI; "LITTLE FRANK," who 1s a bookmaker.

To indicate that the game is run by SONNY RICCOBENE, PH T-3

MONTE and RICCOBENE had

mind his own business, and let SONNY take care of the game.

On March 31, 1962, PH I-1 learned from FRANK IANNARELLA

that there had been some discussion about the division of the profits

and it was mentioned that among the expenses was $20.00 to at least

Numbers

on October 31, 1961, PH T-6 reported that JOHN GIRGENTI

is an office

and pickup

man for ANGELO BRUNO's numbers operation.

According to PH T-6, JOHN 1s single,

lives in Camden, N. J., and

frequents the area of Broad and Mifflin Streets.

PH T-29 on November 22, 1961, said that PHIL TESTA 1s

in charge of BRUNO's numbers operations

in Philadelphia, and that

JOHN SIMONE, aka JOHNNIE CASABLANCA, and JOSEPH POLLESTRELLI,

BUMPERS, handle BRUNO's operations in Trenton, N. J.

On April 16,

1962, and again on May 16, 1962, the same source said that TESTA

continued to operate BRUNO's numbers business.

PH T-8 has related a number of instances of large amounts

of money being handled by associates of BRUNO, sometimes ät BRUNO's

place of business, Penn Jersey Vending Company, in connection with

numbers operations.

For example, on February 28, 1962, FRANK MONTI

brought a large sum of money to Penn Jersey Vending which he gave

to FRANK IANNARELLA and from which MONTI, himself, took $1200.

PH T-6 said that there were occasions when BRUNO's num-

bers business suffered large losses.

Between March 19 and March

23, 1962, TESTA and IANNARELLA were hard hit and on March 23,

1962, when he returned from Miami, BRUNO met with them to dis-

cuss

the situation.

JACOB KATZMAN, aka BILL BALONEY, suffered

proved losses during the week, March 18 - 24, 1962, and BRUNO ap-

a loan to him of $2500, which TESTA actually gave him.

KATZNAN 1s repaying this at the rate of $250 a week.

PH T-3 has reported that FRANK MATTEO is a regular vi-

sitor at the fenn Jersey vending Company,

and PH T-8 says he is

In the numbers business.

On March 9, 1962, MATTEO advised PH T-

that he was quitting "them" because

of problems with them, as he

had been backing business himself and had not made a quarter. He

said that If ANGELO BRUNO wanted the business

MATTEO would give

1t to him.

MATTEO said the business ran about 900 or a thousand

and he would be happy with 20 or 25 per cent.

BOOKMAKING

BRUNO told PH T-1 that on March 27, 1962, PHIL TESTA

told him that two men, AL PATRONE and SONNY D'ANGELO, the latter

a butcher Irom atlantic city, N.J, who owns some horses, were

able to get some kind of solution which could be injeeted

It was BRUNO's understanding that PATRONE and D'ANGELO

secured the substance from a doetor.

They needed $2,500.00 and

thought perhaps BRUNO could provide them with it.

BRUNO

felt that

if anybody knew whether the solution would work it would be FELIX

BOCCHICIO because he is acquainted with jockies and horses and

tried the substance without it doing any good.

PH T-8 advised on March 23, 1962, that RALPH KATZ, aka

Tommy Foley,

brother of GEORGE KATZ, who is the manager of record

of heavyweight challenger SONNY LISTON, is taking horse bet action

on behalf of ANGELO BRUNO.

FRANK D'ALPHONSO told PH T-6 on April 1, 1962, that he.

had been booking horses and sports on his own

and that someone

unexpectedly gave him $500.00 a day In business. When FRANKIE

inquired why It was being given to him, he was told that ANGELO

BRUNO had ordered 1t done.

about his past, mentioned that he,

(EDWARD BRAYLINSKI) and "a guy by

the name of HARVEY," had each ownec

25% of the Grand Hotel in Miami, Fla.

The place had

23 rooms, a bar

and a horse room. Since they knew nothing about running a hotel,

they sold the rooms to IRVING CAREY and they ran the horse room,

with which they did very well, until the law closed down horse rooms

in Miami.

They bought the lease from JOE MASSI (?) and DAVIE GLASS.

BRUNO said that in 1947 and 1948 Miami was wide open and all the

hotels had horse rooms. BRUNO commented that rackets are a thing

of the past and sooner or later there would be a law that would

put numbers and horse booking entirely out of business.

PONTINA

On May 31, 1962, BRUNO told PH T-3 that in the past he

had been booking sports, numbers, and horses and had dealt with

ABE GLASSMAN.

MISCELLANEOUS

PH T-6 said that in early February 1962, BRUNO needed

$2,500.00 cash in a hurry and sent FRANK NARDUCCI

to PHIL TESTA with

Instructions to bring the money in the largest bills he had. TESTA

returned to BRUNO's place of business in about five minutes with

the money, Indicating that somewhere In the immediate neighborhood

of Penn Jersey Vending Company there is a large amount of cash

available for emergencies.

PH T-1 said that on March 6, 1962, BRUNO was asked by

one EDDIE to back his bookmaking business.

EDDIE books sports,

including horses and baseball.

SOLLIE, possibly SOL GLEANER, had

been backing him for 25% but deeided to quit, leaving EDDIE with

no one to back his business. BRUNO ascertained that ED did not owe

ANTONIO POLLINA any money; that he had been on the cuff for about

$4,400 but has cleared it up.

BRUNO recognized this incident as

being connected with "those fellows over the river," probably meaning

New Jersey and told ED that he would make inquiries and thought he

could get a good man for

him.

On April 18, 1962, PH T-3 reported that in 1935 BRUNO

was convicted for operating a still and Internal Revenue levied

a tax of $14,000 or $15,000. BRUNO engaged a lawyer familiar with

a receipt.

In 1952 BRUNO was tried but found not guilty in a

conspiracy ase, the details of which T-3 did not know.

In that

ease Internal Revenue made a levy of $34,000, attached his bank

account, and his safe deposit box, but again

attorney and won the action.

KATZ complained about the way he was being treated by PALERMO,

MARGOLIS, and PALERMO's attorney, MORTON WITKIN, who is also

SONNY LISTON's attorney. KATZ further complained to BRUNO that

an agreement was set up whereby ten per cent would be taken off

the top of LISTON's earnings for all expenses.

T-l then stated,

that for reasons unknown to him, KATZ is dissatisfied with this

agreement and feels that he is being taken advantage of by

MARGOLIS and PALERMO.

KATZ reminded BRUNO, on May 31, 1962, according to

T-1, that when he met with BRUNO and JIMMY (not further identified)

at the Giardino Del Torino Restaurant, they agreed that JIMMY

would get ten per cent and KATZ would get three per cent. BRUNO

denied that this deal was made and stated that three per cent

was not good enough for KATZ and that he was trying to do the

best for KATZ.

BRUNO reminded KATZ that he could have had a

piece of LISTON if he wanted to but that he refused it.

• He

further reminded KATZ that he accepted the original agreement

despite the fact that he,

BRUNO, advised him not to accept it

and that he, BRUNO is now "over

BRUNO advised KATZ;

reportedly,

that it is too late for him, BRUNO, to do anything,

Inasmuch as he, KATZ, had already reached an agreement without

BRUNO knowing about it.

However, T-l advised BRUNO assured

KAT that he would again deal with PALERMO on behalf of KATZ

that would be to KATZ's satisfaction. " BRUNO criticized KATZ

GLORIA also had an offer from

LOU INU of $10,500 with some guarantees that made it a worthwhile

offer.

BRUNO decided that if she could get $11,500,

she could

sell it at that, but, if

, then LOU should get next preference
