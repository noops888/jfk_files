by the informant concerning TONY's association with the subject:

In approximately July, 1957, TONY was introduced

to the subjects who used the name SALLY. BURNS, and GEORGE

The subject and LEVINE

requested TONY to cooperate with them in setting up a ready-

mix cement business in Havana, Cuba. Their suggestion was

that TONY "front" the enterprise, which they indicated would

necessarily be successful due to political connections

which these individuals had in Havana. This venture did

not ultimately materialize due to difficulties which arose

in obtaining & second-hand ready-mix plant from the United

States.

However, during the time plans were being made for

setting up this business, TONY made three trips to Cuba,

between July, 1957 and November 1, 1957.

TONY made each trip with fENNA, and on one

occasion they conferred with GEORGE LEVINE, who at that time

resided at the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo in Havana.. On

• first trip LEVINE took them to a proposed plant site

and assured them that they would have no difficulty obtaining

an option on this land or any problems during the setting-up

stages of the plant due to his excellent connections in

the Cuban Government

On the second trip LEVINE, GENNA,

and TONY arranged for corporation papers to be drawn up

In order that the business could be instituted when they

Informant stated he later learned that "JOHNNY

THE BUG",

,referred to above, 18 JOHN STOPPELLI, known as

a close associate of ANTHONY STROLLO and VITO GENOVESE.

On one occasion, when TONY was told to proceed

to the above-mentioned unmarked office at 40 Exchange

Place, New York City, he observed VITO GENOVESE leaving

the office as he entered.

He had no conversation with

GENOVESE and GENOVESE did not acknowledge his presence at

the time.

Another individual TONY met through contact with

SALLY BURNS

was & hoodlum from Greenwich Village referred

to only as "JOE THE WOP" OF JOE C.

This 1ndividual

appeared to own or manage Tony Pastor'g Night Club in the

Greenwich Village section of New York City. Informant

stated he later learned that "JOE THE WOP"

18 JOSEPH

CATALDO.

A short time after TONY had completed his

payments to SALLY BURNS, aggregating $10,000.00, he was

contacted by BURNS and

instructed to come to BURNS'

apartment on a business matter. Upon arrival at his

apartment BURNS explained to him that he was taking over an

interest in a New York night club, the Cafe de Paris at

53rd Street and Broadway, New York City, a club featuring

a big name entertainment policy.

It was explained that

LOU WALTERS, well known New York City night club impresario,

as "front man" in the club.

When TONY complained to BURNS

that he had no particular interest in entering such a

venture, BURNS reportedly Instructed him in no uncertain

terms that he was to take the job and that he had no choice

in the matter. In view of the physical violence inflicted

on TONY during previous contacts with BURNS and his group,

TONY saw no alternative but to follow BURNS' Instructions.

He served as manager at this club for about four or five

weeks until the club folded and went into bankruptcy.

During this period, SALLY BURNS contributed a total of

about $13,000.00 to the operation of the club and he,

TONY, personally contributed close to $30,000.00 which he

had been able to borrow from close friends.

While the club was in operation BURNS gave the

indication that the $13,000.00 BURNS contributed was as

an investment in thig venture. However, when the club went

Into bankruptcy, BURNS Informed TONY that he was responsible

¡or the $13,000.00 as a personal loan from BURNS. BURNS,

therefore, once again began demands on TONY not only for th

principal

$13,000.00, but for exhorbitant interest on

this"loan" which, to date, amounts to a total of

approximately $16,000.00.

Though BURNS took no active part in managing

this club he was often there during the evening hours, as

were some of his underlings, specifically the individual

referred to previously as BABE, CHICK, and BUDDY.

Part of the $13,000.00 contributed by BURNS was,

according to TONY, raised in the following manner:

TONY accompanied QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey to

a roadsice club where they met RAY, who turned over the

$ 2500.00 to QUAGLIARELLO.
