MI-5 Representative has requested to be advised

if one J. Finke could possibly be identical with Samuel

Benton, who changed his name officially in 1943 to

Samuel Fink. (s)

Background information on this request is that in

December, 1966, at the height of the political campaign

in the Bahamas,

allegations were received by British

Intelligence officials that certain individuals connected

with United States gambling interests were preparing to»

furnish money and weapons to the underdog, the Progressive

Liberal Party.

The allegation implied that hoodlum interests

were determined to preserve their control of casino gambling

operations in the Bahamas.

In the identification of certain individuals alleged to be

involved in this plot, we made available background information

on one Smuly Finkielman who changed his name to Samuel Fink and

is now commonly known as SamuelKBenton (s

111

Benton has the reputation of being associated with

confidence men and swindlers and has been suspected

of t

being involved in the theft of stock certificates. "He Cu

mis a private investigator, resident of Miami Beach, Florida,

who was born on July 1920, in Poland, and admitted tosthe

United States in 1943 and became a naturalized citizen

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re:

Gambling Activities - Bahamas

SECRET

Because of the efforts of the British authorities

to involve the FBI in the open Commission of Inquiry

hearings being conducted in the Bahamas on all casino

gambling operations, we are not furnishing any type of

information to British authorities pertaining to such

gambling activities.

It would appear, however, that we

should advise the representative of Mi-s in this instance

that we are unable to determine from identifying information

available to us whether J. Finke and Samuel Benton may be

identical (s)

ACTION:

If you approve, attached is a blind memorandum

advising MI-S that it cannot be determined from the

information presently at hand if J. Finke is identical with

Samuel Benton.

A brief description of Benton is included.
