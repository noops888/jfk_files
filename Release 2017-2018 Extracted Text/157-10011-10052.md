Mr. McCone.

What did you say, sir?

The Chairman. Where did the actual sabotage of the pur-

chased equipment take place?

War it in London?

Mr. McCone. I am not sure whether it was in London or

it was in some European port of embarkation, Rotterdam of Ham-

burg or something.

Mr. Schwarz.

Was there in that connection also an

activity to sabotage the shipment of

to Cuba?

MI. McCone. It seems to me I recall some such thing,

whether it was

or others, there was

some operation in connection with material from

to Cuba.

Mr. Schwarz.

Were there any efforts undertaken to blow

up ships?

Mr. McCone. There was a great deal of talk about it.

There were some rather exotic plans. But I don't think there was

ever any explosive planted in a ship.

Now, I may be wrong on that, but I do not recall it.

Mr. Schwarz. Whether or not anything ever come off, did the

committee approve the blowing up of certain ships?

Mr. Melone. I would have to go to the record to answer

that question.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you recall whether the plans included

blowing up the ships in transit between Cuba and other countries?
