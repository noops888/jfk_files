II. Politics:

Ao In sugust of 1951 it was reported thet, the Cormuniat would

attempt to penetrate the Partido Accion Renovadora (PAR) to

such an oxtint that they would have cuntrol, whereby they could

elect Conmuniate to the National Assemuly®

The Communists did

Infiltrate PAR, but they became so numorous and so vociferous

that the members of PAR finally realised what had happened and

printed leafluts dennouncing the Cormunists within the Party.

PAR practically dissolved thereafter and again the Communists

voro left without a political front group.

The Coumnists dir

ing this time did a lot of talking and planning, but thoy admit

ted that it was difficult "under the OSORIO regime" to make pol-

lucas strides, but that they were maling great advatices in the

labor movement. It can be written that the Communist Party to-

day has had no success in either establiahing itself as a strong

political force nor has 1t buin able to use another political par

ty as its tool.

IV. Propaganda

A.

Communist propaganda is neglible.

Since the State of Siege was

declared the 27th of September, 1952 there have been enly two

instances in which communist propaganda has appeared on thestreets

of San Salvador.

In both cases the propaganda was mimeographed

and did not appear to have a large circulation as persona re-

ceiving such propaganda were diffioult to find (not even PULAR

could find a copy among hia Cominiat friends) and there were

no editorial comments on the appearance of the propaganda.

In cumation, the PCS 10 inoffective as a political force at

the present time. It has not been a political force in the

last twenty years, but it haspade progress in labor matters

and probably at one time controlled more than one half of the
