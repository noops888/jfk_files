SUBJE

Assassination of President Kennedy

Allegation

/i serentist of CUBAN

involvement in Ascassinations.

l. An untested source recently furnished us with the following

Information he allegedly received from a well-known Cuban soientiat

and acquaintance on 23 November 1963, but which he had forgotten to

report. The release of the Warren Commission Report on the assass-

Ination reminded bim of the incident.

2. The scientist said that by chance he had been at the Havana

airport on the afternoon of 22 November 1963 when at 1700 hours an

aircraft with Mexican markings landed and parked at the far side of the

fiald. Two men, whom he recognised as Cuban "gangsters," alighted,

entered the rear entrance of the administration building and disappeared

without going through the normal customs procedures. His curlosity

was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had just arrived,

from Dallas, Texas, via Tljuana and Mexico City. The plane had been

forced to land at ljuana due to engine trouble. By combining the date,

the origin of the flight, and the known reputation of the two men, he

theorized that the two men must have been involved somehow in the assa

Ination of President Kennedy. He speculated that Lee Harvey OSWALD

had acted in the pay of CASTRO, and that the two Cubans had been in

Dallas to organize of oversee the operation. He told the source that he

had been greatly distressed by what he had seen and heard and had to

tell someone about it. He then cautioned source not to tell anyone else

about it, or they would both be shot by the Cubans.

3. The source has passed away since furnishing the above infor-

follow-up on this matter impossible.
