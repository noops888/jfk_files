Remarks (By SAC):

A great deal of potential has been demonstrated by this informant

and information received on a daily basis is being utilized

continually by those Agents assigned

to the Criminal Intelligence

Program in the Pittsburgh Office. Financial developments

relating to the North Star Cement Block Company assume prime

importance when it is realized that LA ROCCA has been designated

as the prime target subject of an intensification program

looking toward early prosecution on any Federal violation.

LA ROCCA and the supervisory employees of North Star have

spoken freely enough for this informant to ascertain their

reactions to investigations being conducted by both the

Internal Revenue Service and the FBI at Pittsburgh. (See

supplemental page 3a)

When the installation relating to Bufile 100-217722

is activated, the proportionate number of man hours per

week spent on PG 622-C* will be reduced below 33 percent.

17. Remarks (continued) :

The Pittsburgh Office is looking for a great deal more, as

far as

specific criminal intelligence information is concerned,

in relation to the GENOVESE-LA ROCCA organization. In my

opinion the

position of prominence this

phase of our activity

has attained, as well as the issuance of recent Bureau

instructions

in this regard, and the information received thus

far by the Pittsburgh Office justifies the continuation of this

installation.

The Bureau will be promptly advised of the extent of any

possible violations developed as a result of this technical

surveillance.

The LA ROCCA investigation and this coverage in

particular is being given my personal attention on a continuing

basis and I will insure that constant efforts are made to

establish a Federal violation against this individual. When

information of immediate interest or significance is received,

it will be promptly brought to the Bureau's attention in the

daily teletype being submitted

relative to LA ROCCA.

IN VIEW OF THE CONVICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INTENT

TO KILL AND HIS ARREST FOR CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON, HE MAY

BE ARMED AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.

Insert to FD-143 entitled,

"JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUATION OF

TECHNICAL OR MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE."

The most important information furnished by this informant

since the submission of the last FD-143 on 3/22/62

concerns a meeting of JOHN CONTI, alleged nephew of

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, who is general manager at

the North Star Cement Block Company in Pittsburgh, and

SAMUEL MANNARINO of the MANNARINO organization of

kensington, fa., on whom an intensification target-type

investigation is being conducted. It was noted by the

informant that these two met last on a business proposition

, on Sunday, 6/3/62.

It was

indicated that MANNARINO owns 600 acres of ground

and is

now dealing with the North Star Cement Block Company

to build homes on his property.

Thebbüilding of 123

of these homes was to begin immediately and it was

indicated that MANNARINO is definitely part of the

entire proposition.

As a result of this information, the Bureau has advised

that this matter should be given thorough investigative

attention in connection with disruption objectives

and

possible future prosecution.

on 6/11/62, the Pittsburgh Office ascertained that there

was considerable inductance and cross-talk on cable 56,

counts 341 through 50 as well as considerable AC voltage

running as high as two volts on count 348. CSPG 175-s

was

contacted concerning this undesirable

condition and

he immediately referred the matter to the Engineering

Department of the Bell Telephone Co.

Due to the complexity

of these existing conditions monitoring of the misur

and tesur operations was discontinued on 6/11/62 until

the lines can be cleared and balanced.

The Pittsburgh

Office has not, therefore, e the benefit of the knowledge

of the operations within

Star Cement Block

Co. since the aforementioned date..y.:
