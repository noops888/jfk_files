The persons who were in attendance who were recognized

something Constructive. This Gill recently, a few years

or less ago Made a trip to the

Soviet Union ete on the

Youth Conference Know

as the 'world Youth Conference.'

He will probably emerge from the New York thing as a

full time organiser in some special field suchas youth.

At the start of the Meeting Genne brought out

her brief case full of clippings. (Newspaper) etc

she

also had a lot of penciled notes which she was

undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing

and to give others hell for not co-operating with her.

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around

the late Pres. Kennedy.

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a

Communist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

against the C. party of America but by the time the

reactionaries were getting started it was announced

that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the

extrene

right had been active. This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

C. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme

right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober

the masses that it

facts act

was the same caliber of people who

had Insulted Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas, .

Texas.

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this

Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he

told them he gets lots of letters of enguiry about the

C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds.

of others and even sent him Iiterature if he requested

it.

They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the alr with a

statement but he

stated to them he would have to dig the

letter out and be sure before he Made any statement.

Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when

he got back

to

New York to look in the files it he had a letter from

Um Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also an

inmate of Cambridge Asylum for a period of time, Gorby

"Palmer stated that it was News to him as the only thing

he Knew about it Was the articles

In the paper

and

the

first one looked as if Genne had stayed on the phone

too long should have hung up quick. He also

stated that

In 1948 when he had this trouble everyone Knew about

It and then he got more help and was successful in

defeating the reactionaries.

You have to always work

together on these Matters If you will be successful.

The hour was drawing Near ten o'clock P.M. and the

Steuberville delegation had to work that Nite.

Lunch was furnished by each and everyone with the

exception of A Johnson and he put away plenty.

Johnson stated that he had been down this way about one

week ago and had Contacted some of his old friends

one in particular

was Adolph Pacifico. he

by

wanted to talk to him on a

so called Applachian Coal project

which has been going on for some time Adolph wanted to

meet with him if he could find time later

Was unable to

see him at this time.

Everyone present asked A. Johnson when he was coming
