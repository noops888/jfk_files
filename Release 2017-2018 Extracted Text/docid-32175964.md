FRANK

TORINI

also known as Frank Sturgis

is an American citizen who has been engaged in Cuban

revolutionary activities for the past five years.

MM T-3,

who is familiar with some phases of Cuban

activities in the Central Florida area,

furnished the

following

information on September 5, 1963, regarding a neeting which

was held in Orlando, Florida, on August 24, 1963, and

which is set forth below:

Among those at this meeting was ANTONIO VECIANA,

who mentioned that the Alpha 66 group in Los Angeles,

California, had purchased a T-6 military-type aircraft

for use in

anti-CASTRO raids on Cuba. He said

1. 83, 000.00

was needed to transport the plane to Florida and arm it

with, anong other items, two 50 caliber machine guns.

VECIANA said they would possibly fly the plane

from an undisclosed airstrip in Florida, and that two

"Americans,

reportedly faniliar with this type of aircraft,

had offered their services, free of charge, to participate

in any raids conducted."

He said one of the Americans is

supposed to have a "Comanche" airplane,

which he also offered.

However, VECIANA said they preferred to use the T-6, which

is faster and more maneuverable.

VECIANA also mentioned that Alpha 66 has a key,

with an airstrip, on which they have arms and amunition

stored, but that

they hesitate to use it, as it is

allegedly

being watched by federal authorities. Location of this key

was not mentioned.

ANTONIO VECIANA is Treasurer of the SNFE - Alpha 66

organization.

On September 17, 1963, MM T-2 made available informa-

tion furnished by a Cuban

exile,

who was la radio broadcasters

and who received this information from an untested confidant

of the SNFE, who is sometimes present at the meetings of this

group.

SECRED

On June 19, 1963, MM T-1, another Government

agency which conducts personnel and intelligence

the Cuban exile

organization Movimiento Revolucionario

del Pueblo (MRP), had confided in a private conversation

during mid-May,

MRP and the SNFE and Alpha 66 was engaged In raising

tunds for a major operation called "Plan Omega"

SEHWERERT did not have the details of this plan but said

E]

It would be a bigger operation than a single attack on

Soviet personnel or installations in Cuba and that the

launching of the plan depended on the success of the

fund raising campaign.

He said that the "military" wings of this

alliance, the SNFE and Alpha 66, had announced their

Intention of keeping

90% of their collected money in

military equipment and operations, and had called on the

other organizations with which they were in close contact

to do the same.

These groups included the 30th of

November, the Montecristl, an unnamed formerly anti-

BATISTA organization, and

the Anti-communist Front of

Liberation.

He said that this alliance's headquarters in

Miami had circularized all of their representatives

requesting that fund raising schemes be organized.

circular quoted the sum of $136.00 for a cannon shell

returned to Miami. U. S. Customs will be contacted

and arrangements made to examine this boat.

During interview,

GUTIERREZ made mention of the fact chat chis boat had no name,

was not registered, and that he was unable to understand by

what right he had been seized by the Coast Guard in Interna

tional waters.

This is pointed out as it may be difficult

to ascertain the origin of ownership of this boat.

SANFORD CLOSE, owner of the building in which the

SNFE office is located, has been contacted with regard to

feasibility of a trash cover on this office and the Bureau

will be advised of the outcome of this matter.

A list of the long distance telephone calls chargeo

to the office is being obtained for review.

This report has been classified SECRET because it

contains information from CIA, so classified.
