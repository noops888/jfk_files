On May 14, 1959, JAMES LANZA was observed by an agent

of the San Francisco Office to meet with JOSEPH L. ALIOTO and his

father in an automobile in front of LANZA's office at 559

Washington Street, San Francisco.

LANZA remained in the automo-

bile for approximately fifteen minutes when he was observed to

leave it and enter an office building immediately across the

street from his office.

The ALloros drove away in their automobile,

which was determined to be registered in the name of DOMENICA

ALIOTO, the mother of JOSEPH L. ALIOTO.

Contact was then had with SF T-6 who advised that JAMES

LANZA had been in his office inquiring about the immigration case

Of SIMONE SCOZZARI, of LOS Angeles, and one of the individuals

who attended the Apalachin meeting, as well as a companion of LANZA

on the night of November 13, 1957.

Source advised that LANZA had

told him

he had to appear before a Federal Grand Jury in Los Angeles

on May 18, 1959, and

source advised LANZA that he would also be

in court in Los

Angeles. on that date, handling the deportation

case of SCOZZARI.

Informant at that

time indicated that JOSEPH

ALIOTO would handle the case of LANZA before the Grand Jury.

On the afternoon of May 14, 1959, JOSEPH L. ALIOTO was

interviewed by agents of the FBI and he was questioned concerning

the members of his family and as to whether or not he had any

information concerning the Apalachin meeting. On this occasion

ALIOTO was questioned

as to the death of his

uncle, MUZIO

ALIOTO, who was killed in 1927 or before in a gang

fight.

It was also indicated to ALIOTO that this killing was

allegedly a killing by the Black Hand in San Francisco. ALIOTO

stated that MUZIO was killed when he went after a gang and to his

knowledge, there was no connection between this fight and the Black

Hand or Mafia.

ALIOTO indicated that this was just a gang and

that a man by the name of LATATA was indicted for the murder.

ALIOTO stated that he knew of no organized group of hoodlums

called the Black Hand or the Mafia and

again indicated that a gang

had killed his uncle.

When questioned about his knowledge of the Apalachin meet-

ing in November of 1957, he stated

that he had no knowledge of the

meeting, but that he had just acquired

a client who was at present

involved in the current proceedings before the Federal Grand Jury

in Los Angeles.

ALIOTO did not identify his client but added that

he had no information concerning the Apalachin meeting.

On May 19, 1959, SF I-6 advised that while in Los Angeles

on May 18, 1959, he had received a call to contact JAMES LANZA

Both RAYMOND COSMO TERRANELLA and MICHAEL A. GENARO

are considered quite wealthy today. As a matter of general

information, TERRANELLA apparently took over the Texas Produce

Company from the GENARO family, and MICHAEL A. GENARO, then

apparently took over the Miller Beer Distributorship and

TERRANELLA joined him in about 1962-63 when he sold out of

Texas Produce Company. In light of this known association, the

following is noted:

A confidential

source of the Dallas County, Sheriff's

Office, according to Deputy Sheriff O 'BYRNE COX on March 2,

1959, advised that during the 1920's bootlegging and illegal

liquor distribution in Dallas under the control of one of

three brothers who operated the Texas Produce Company and who

a close associate of CARLO and JOSEPH T. PIRANIO.

April 1, 1959, SF I-ll (whose father was a member of the same

LCN family) advised that RAYMOND TERRANELLA and his two

brothers,

ANTHONY and JOSEPH, were operators of the Texas

Produce Company during the 1920's and that RAYMOND was at that

time a partner with MICHAEL A. GENARO in the Miller Beer

Distributorship in Dallas.

Informant described JOHN GENARO as

a close associate of JOSEPH I. PIRANIO, deceased boss of the

LCN family in Dallas.

The Dallas Office by communication dated July 22, 1968,

advised that:

On July 13, 1968, SF T-12 advised he knew LAWRENCE

and JOHN GENARO and the fact that LAWRENCE had been dead for

many years.

He could not recall specifically whether he died

of natural causes or the exact cause of his death.

Hè does

recall that many years ago, a car, believed to have belonged to

JOHN Or LAWRENCE GENARO, had been

wired to explode, and a song

got in the car and was severely injured.

The rigged car was intendec

for

the father.

_Informant did not know at this time whether it

was the car of JOHN or LAWRENCE GENARO.

ADMINI STRATIVE DATA, CONTINUED

The Dallas Office is continuing its research

in regard to the activities

and possible LCN background

of the deceased father-in-law of JOSEPH L. ALIOTO,

LAURENCE GENARO.

The following information is placed on the

Administrative pages of this report as it refers to the

statements made by TE informants in regard to their

reaction to the March 15th issue of "Life" magazine

regarding JOSEPH CERRITO and LCN members in this area.

....

On March 20, 1968,

SF 2745-C-TE was contacted

at his home in Richmona, California, by

SAs RUDOLPH

H. MANCINI and RICHARD VITAMANTI, at which time he

related that he had read the article. and said,

"It puts

me right in the middle."

Informant advised that since

the article names him prominently as the one who alleg-

edly "bungled" the matter with HAROLD SMITH, SR., JOE

CERRITO and his "flunkies" will be looking for a

"patsy" and the sole blame for bringing the bad publicity

to the San Jose family will be placed on his shoulders.

Informant said that CERRITO will not take into account

that he

"started the whole mess" with his libel suit

against "Life" magazine.

92123

Informant advised that, in

addition, he did not tell CERRITO to go to Italy and

get "fouled up" as he did. Informant advised that the

facts pertaining to the "SMITH matter" as set forth in

the magazine article regarding him were "inaccurate.'

Informant advised that he never

threatened to kill

HAROLD SMITH,

SR. or his brother, RAYMOND SMITH, as a

result of his failure to collect the $100,000.00 or any

Informant advised, however, that

HAROLD

SMITH, SR. did threaten to kill him if he decided to

"back out" of the contract once he agreed to handle it,

even though he was not apprised of who the victim might

Informant reiterated that he learned sometime

after his conversation with SMITH about the "contract"

and that the intended victim was one IOLA SMITH, the

step-mother of HAROLD SMITH,

SR., who was married to

his father, RAYMOND I. SMITH. Informant said that

when HAROLD SMITH, SR. came to him and said to "cancel"

the contract because the matter was

"straightened out,"

he informed HAROLD SMITH, SR. that he (informant) was

now aware that IOLA SMITH was the intended victim.

Informant advised that he is now somewhat concerned,

since if anything "happens to MITH" in the future,

the authorities will undoubtedly come looking for him.

Informant said

he has "washed his hands of the whole

affair"; that he wants nothing further to do with this

matter and, during his last contact with HAROLD SMITH,

SR., he advised him that although he

"welched" on a

"contract" in violation of the "Nevada code," he was

not pursuing the matter any further and to forget the

whole thing.

Informant added, however, that there was

still about $90,000.00 in expenses incurred by his

brother, JOHN MI SURACA, to collect the money and he told

HAROLD SMITH, JR. that this money should be paid.

Informant advised that although he was not aware of

what JOHN MI SURACA might have done with regard to the

above $90,000.00 in expenses, he was sure JOHN MI SURACA

wöuld not

forget the debt and he would continue in his

efforts to collect it.

Informant advised that the source for the

"Life" magazine article referred

to above has to be the

"big mouth," HAROLD SMITH, SR. himself.

He described

HAROLD SMITH, SR. as an "alcoholic and junkie" who is

"afraid of his shadow." Informant said HAROLD SMITH,

SR. likes to

"play big shot" because of his money

because of his

"foul mouth" and "crooked dealings,"

there are numerous persons who would like to see some-

thing happen

to him.

Informant advised that if anything

happens to HAROLD SMITH, SR. in the future and he

(informant) is questioned about the matter, he can readily

prove that he is now a "sick man" and that he has been

"sick man" for the past several years, during which time

he has been almost solely confined to his home. Infor-

mant advised that his

physical disability can be sub-

stantiated by numerous medical records.

Informant advised that to his knowledge,

IOLA SMITH has never been told that she was the intended

victim of her step-son's plot to kill her.
