ADMINISTRATIVE

PCI

advised on April 2, 1964,

that it was his belief that there was no bookmaking activity

taking place at 948 Eastw√∂odd Avenue in Chicago. He

advised

that after making inquiries among his contacts

in the neighborhood, he was unable to obtain any informa-

tion which indicated bookmaking activity at this address.

He said possibly the location was being used for an occasional

poker game but it was his opinion that this was on a small

scale.

He also said that he had never heard the name LEONARD

PATRICK Or DAVE YARAS mentioned in connection with this

location. He had always assumed that MAX NETTLER was in

complete charge of the operation at that address.
