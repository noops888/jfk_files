RE: FOREIGN POLITICAL MATTERS - CUBA

The Revolutionary Governmert of Cuba makes clear its

protest at this time

and urges corresponding sanctions. It

claims the return of the kidnapped citizens and of the Cuban

fishing boat "elvira".

2. The manifestations of the Press Officer of the

North ¿merican Department of Stae, Richard to hillips,

disseminated by the cablegraph agencies on June 19, constitutes

a manifest incitement to sedition, to subversi on and the

reiteration of the interventionist policy of the United States

concerning internal questions of the jepublic of cuba.

The

Government of Cuba makes clear its protest a gainst such

manifestations which indicate nothing else but the continuation

or policy which has cost the united States uncountable reverses

and dangers.

3. The Revolutionary Government of Cuba protests,

equally, the recent flight over cuban territory for the purpose

of espionaze by a military airplane of the United states which

its own North merican press divulged and warns that the

artillery of Cuba has orders to shoot at whatever foreign war

plane which dies over our territory.

4. On the 1ith of June, Customs agents of Miani,

Florida, announced the confiscation, in an abandoned airport:

in the area of the verglades, of a bi-motor airplane, of

the Beechcraft Bonanza type, at the moment at which it was

ready to take off for cuba,

with the proposition of bombarding

the oil refinery located in Havana Bay and containing in its

hundred charges of

dynamite.

five Cuban counter-revolutionaries and a North merican

identified as Evelid 1pizar, Carlos Hernandez Sanchez,

Rene ispinosa Hernandez, Victor ¿spinosa Hernandez, ligue!

Alvarez i Sambenton, were immediately freed regardless of

being convicted of a flagrant violation of international law

and of the North inerican legislature.

SECRET

RE: FOREIGN POLITICAL LATTERS - CUBA

This action, as well as the attack made at the

end of last April against this

same Cuban refinery by a plane

which took off from North American territory, obliges us to

accelerate our cefense preparations in order to be in a

position to intercept and shoot down any war: plane which :

flies over air space at any altitude.

5. Today the leaders of the counter-revolution

lave openty proclaimed from North American territory the

arryine out of activities of infiltration and introductio

of arms in the country in order to carry out acts of an

aggressive character against the Cuban people. These arms

and these agents could only come from the United States or

other countries near Cuba.

This violates international norms. This creates a

climate of insecurity in the continent,

because only the

governments which respect the rights of other countries can

demand respect for themselves.

These deeds contribute

nothing to the improving of relations between the United States

and. Cuba, or to the diminishing of the existing tension or

the dangers and aggressions against our country which pio-

foundly affect world peace.

It is lamentable that the Government of Cuba sees

the necessity of resending these

• notes of protest as a

consequence of deeds which

in any light are arbitrary,

irresponsible and uncontrolled; which have already overwhelmed

world opinion; which cannot view without great concern

the repeated

attacks against Cuba, and which again seriously

endanger peace.

The above sousce advised on Tune 24, 1963, that ow

the same

date the Czechoslovak Eibassy notified the cuban

Ministry

of Forcign Alfairs that it had been wable. to present

the above note but would do so at 4830 pomo that dates
