Request for Studies from the CIA Historical

Offices -- the May 8 Washington Post article.

In today's Washington Post there is a story concerning

the Committee's requests for documentation, which includes.

the charge that the staff, in asking for studies from the

'IA historical office, had "asked only for reports of opera-

tions that originated in either the Eisenhower or Nixon

administrations." This is clearly and demonstrably not

the case.

I attach a copy of the 15 studies we put on our

priority list. Furthermore, using a rough breakdown into

categories of the some 50 studies we have requested shows

the following pattern:

(1) Studies dealing with the Kennedy/Johnson era -- 11

(2) Studies dealing with the Eisenhower/Nixon period - 4

(3)

Studies covering the period roughly 1950 through

1965

- - - -18

(4)

Histories prior to 1952

-- 4

(5) Organizational histories (Office of Training, eic.) 10

(6)

No dates given on the study

- 1
