time. NY I-3 said that the JURE has encountered grave

financial problems and has also encountered a certain amount

of animosity from the Cuban exiles.

stated that the JURE still has its boat which

NY I Svenus" and this boat currently 1s In San Juan,

Puerto Rico.

sufficient military equipment to carry out any military action

inside Cuba, and has no plans for any military action in the

near future.

NY T-3 stated that all anti-Castro organizationsat

the present time are encountering similar difficulties as

for any immediate activity against the government of Prime

for the Cuban exiles to carry out anyactivity against cuba

and that the only hope the Cuban exiles had was that some

uprising would occur Inside Cuba which would bring about the

downfall of the present Cuban Government.
