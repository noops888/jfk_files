ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

Directer Secy

By lotter 1919-4 20 all Frank Church,

we noted that the Senate Select Committee had in its possession

certain materials, which were compiled by the Commission on

CIA Activities Within the United States, for the preparation

of its report to the President, which materials most probably

contained information regarding FBI operations of the utmost

sensitivity. In order to avoid any inadvertent compromise of

such information, we requested an opportunity to meet with

Senators Church and Tower at the earliest convenience to

discuss areas of this Bureau's activities which might warrant

special consideration.

Senator Church agreed that the above

matter would be discussed with Director Kelley at the latter's

appearance before the Executive Session of the Senate Select

Committee meeting scheduled for 7/7E688*

12-11=525-400

For your additional information,

this Bureau had

earlier ascertained that the Senate Select Committee has had

access to a 693-page document prepared by CIA listing instances

wherein CIA believed its operations may have exceeded its

mandate. A review of this document by Bureau personnel indi-

cated that some of these operations involve matters involving

this Bureau of an extremely sensitive nature. In response to

a request of CIA for copies of pertinent material contained

in the above 693-page document, CIA on this date furnished

copies of the material requested.

3 JUL 22 1975

In anticipation of the Director's appearance before

SSC on 7/16/75, the above material furnished by CIA consisting

of approximately 174 pages was reviewed. This material is

found to contain numerous references, in sanitized form, to

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SA BY SSC

Campbell advised he was on a squad in the security area,

that his Supervisor was &. H. Belter and that the Security

Coordinating Supervisor was L. H. R. Oberndorf, now déceased.

Epstein then asked that they get to the point and

inguired of Campbell as to when he had heard about the King

"cases:

Campbell responded that sometime early in 1964 he

heard of the case and recalled it was shortly after the

assassination of President Kennedy, and King had been named

Man of the Year (Time" Magazine),

that Campbell became

knowledgeable under the following circumstances.

Campbell

was summoned to the office of the SAC either by a fellow SA,

B1l1 Bergeron, or by Supervisor Belter, speeific individual

not recalled.

Present in the office was the SAC at the time,

Marlin Johnson, the then FBI Assistant Director William C.

Sullivan, Bergeron and probably several others, names not

recalled.

The following was related by Campbell in response

to epstein's questions concerning what tock place at the

conference.

After some opening remarks by the SAC, Sullivan

advised that he did not want any of the information they

were to discuss to leave the room.

Sullivan said that he

had information indicating that King was associating with

communiats and that it was possible that king's movement was

being infiltrated.

As a result, Sullivan sald he wanted a

technical installation on King in an effort to verify this

information.

At some later dote, Campbell was assigned to

monitor the technical installation on King in which a radio

transnitter was used. He could not recall whether thei

equipment was signed out to him but he did take the equipment

home and on a Sunday afternoon he took a bus to Union Station.

Additional responses to questions from

Epstein were as follows. Campbell utilized only one radio

receiver and listened to only one radio microphone.

could not recall if there were any others in use. He and

Borys took turns listening to the transmitter. Campbell

did not remove the transmitter when he left the hotel as he

never

entered any of the rooms assigned to the king party:

Campbell did not know any details concerning Mr. Sullivan's

remarks about King's association with communists. Campbell

did not attend all the meetings at WrO concerning the King

installation. It was his best recollection that the monitoring

was done in rooms one floor above the rooms occupied by the

King party.

At the end of the interview, Epstein indicated he

had one final question which was, as best Campbell could

remember, "Is there anything else about this case that you

know that has not come out because I did not ask the right

question of did not ask a question in the right way?" Campbell

replied that he felt that Epstein had done a good job in

asking the questions.

NOTE:

Assistant Director Mintz briefed Campbell prior to

his interview..

Campbell was accompanied to the SSC offices

by Supervisor S: F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project but

Phillips was

not called upon for any consultation.

Epstein then stated lets get to the point. When

did you hear about the King case.

President Kennedy was shot and King was named man of the

year - I was summons to the SAC's office either by my

associate Bill Bergeron of my supervisor Mi. Belter not

specifically recalled. The SAC, Marlin Johnson, Assistant

Director William Sullivan, Bergeron and probably several

others not recalled were in attendance.

The following is

a narrative of information I furnished in response to

Epstein's questions.

The SAC made several remarks and Assistant Director

Sullivan then stated that he did not want any information

discussed to leave the room. Sullivan stated he had informa-

tion that indicated King was associating with communists and

it was possible his movement was being infiltrated. Sullivan

said he wanted a technical installation on King in an effort

to verify this information.

took the equipment home and on a Sunday afternoon I caught a

bus to Union Station, I walked around for a short time and then

by cab went to the hotel and checked in under an assumed

name (name not remembered).

I did not recall who made my

reservations.

The first night King did not enter the room •

we were monitoring. (I did not recall the names of

individuals who occupied room but they were associated with

party.) The next day we (John Borys of WFO and myself,

moved to a different room. I could not recall how the

arrangements for the move was made.

We then monitored King

for about two days, stayed one extra day at the hotel, and

checked out. Either Borys or myself stayed in the room at

all time.

One would take the logs and tapes out of the

hotel each day and turn them over to someone from WFO (details

not recalled). At no time did I ever enter any room in the

hotel that was occupied by King or any member of his party.

The tape recorder was manually operated and we attempted to

run it any time someone was in the room.

I know of no physical

or photographic surveillance on King during this time.

had no instructions that I can recall concerning only listening

to certain types of conversation.

Epstein asked if I kept a card at the office

showing my location. I responded that it was the normal

practice to place a

card in file when one was away from

the office.

In this case, if I placed a card in file I

probably would place a notation

like "Special - See

Supervisor Belter for contact."

I had never seen any paper, memos, etc. (other

than logs) dealing with this case.

Epstein asked if I ever saw the tapes again

after departing the hotel.

I stated that sometime after

(possibly one or two months) I was asked to review the tapes

and logs in an effort to obtain additional information.

did this at the FBI Laboratory and was assisted by SA John

Matter, retired, in the technical enhancement techniques -

such as filtering. I was not directed to concentrate on

any one part of the tapes but reviewed all of the tapes.

I did not type any of the information and if it was typed

it was probably typed in the Intelligence Division. I have

not seen the tapes since that time.

I first heard about my interview

from Mr. Daly of

the Legal Division and did not discuss this case with

Mr. Bergeron, Mr. Matter or MT. Borys after that contact.

I do not endy, the tapes are still in extstance.

Dorio asked if it was the normal practice to

erase tapes. I stated that in this type investigation I

was sure only new tapes were used.

I was certain the tapes

were new if they were still wrapped in cellophane and they

had the appearance of new tapes.

She also asked how I got

the key for the second room at the hotel and did I have

to re-register.

I stated, I did not recall but felt sure I

did not re-register and some agent from WFO probably got

the key to me.

No other person entered the rooms except

Borys and myself where the monitoring was taking place.

Other responses to questions from Epstein were:

We only had one radio receiver and

only listened to one

radio microphone, I could not recall if there were others.

Conrad was interviewed in SSC quarters for the

approximate period 10110 a.n. to 10:45 a.n., July 9, 1975,

Conrad was questioned concorning his career in the

FBI and the positions which he held. He replied that he

entered the r'Bl in 1934 and tus assigned to the laboratory

there he spent his entire FDI career. During the 1940's, he

ras placed in charge of the Radio Ingineering Section (RE) .

In 1955, he became the lumber One Man, the equivalent of being

the Deputy AD in the laboratory.

In 1961, he vas elevated to

the position oi Al, which he held until his retirement in

mdđ-1973.

Conrad as queried as to whother the laboratory

vas broken down into various sections at the time he vas AD.

RE: ILTERVIET OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

Conrad was told that the SSO was focusing on an

allegation that some tapes vere made of a conversation of

been advised that Conrad had been requested to make copies

of such tapes for the indicated purpose of mailing outside •

the FBI. Contad was then asked that he knet about this

matter.

His anster was that he did not know or recall

anything that nould fit the description above.

Conrad asked

Epstein if the latter could indicate a time frame which

might assist Conrad in his recall. Epstein said they vere

referring to the early 1960's, after which Conrad responded

that that was a long time ago and Conrad was just unable to

recall anything on the allegation. Conrad vas asked 1f he

recalled making copies of a tape dealing with King ithout

knowing it ras for the purpose of the tapes being mailed.

His response tas "To."

Conrad was asked if he had know that the FBI had

technical coverage of King. His response vas, "ot specifically."

He was then asked what he meant by "specifically" and this

point was pressed by the intercogators. Conrad responded

that he recalled that FBI Director Hoover had announced

publicly chat the FBI had in effect a number of wire taps,

thus indicating that a number of FBI subjects who were inder

investigation vere thus covered through such means. However,

Conrad did not know or recall that King vas actually one of

the subjects of such coverage.

Conrad was asked whether he recalled, aside from

the King case, whether any recordings were sent to the

Laboratory for processing or copying when they related to

Civ1l Fights matters. His response was. "Ifo."

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

Conrad was asked who was in charge of the RE and

responded by asking for time frame.

He was told the

reference was to the early 1960's and Conrad responded that;

because of the turnover of personnel, he could not respond

to any specific, times.

He was then asked who was in Charge

at. the time Conrad retired in 1973 and he gave the name of

Wayne Bradley (retired).

He was asked how long Bradley was

the Section Chief. of RE and Conrad answered that he could

not remember.

Conrad was asked whether

it was common to make:

copies of tapes derived from technical coverage.

He responded

that it was done on occasion and expleined that tapes would

sometimes be sent to the laboratory in order to obtain more

coherent coples through a process known as filtering:

such instances, filtered copies were produced in the

Laboratory

When asked where this was done,

Conrad said it

was done in the RE.,

He was asked whether all tapes derived

from technical coverage were sent to the Laboretory and his

response was "No.

" He was asked if all technical coverage

tapes were maintained by the laboratory and his response

was

"No."

When asked under what conditions they would be

sent to the Laboratory, Concad advised that they would be

sent to the Laboratory. when it was necessary to have them

filtered. In response to inquiry as to what the mechanics

were of getting the tapes to the Laboratory, Contad said there

was no single procedure.

They might be sent by a fleld office

directly to the laboratory with a request for assistance

in

making the tapes more readable; or, the assistance of this

nature might originate with an FBI Headquarters official.

Conrad was asked for the detalled mechanies of i

routing requests for filtering and he responded that he did

not see how this bore on the King matter.

He was then asked

whether a record was always made of requests for filtering,

and he responded that, if the request was from the field,

there rould normally be a cover communication thich vould

be the permanent record.

Horevet, if the request vas from

a Headquarters official, there might not alrays be a written

record. He was asked how the material would get to a specitie

person

in the laboratosy and he responded by saying that it

might be routed directly by the sender or routed to the

Laboratory generally, and then from the central routing

point in the laboratory it would be sent to either Re or the

specific person tho would handle the matter. Conrad vas

asked hor a router would know where to send such an item and

he responded that there vould be information in the cover

communication which vould assist in this routing.

Conrad was asked whether it vas necessary to

account by inventory for all tapes used in making copies of

tapes.

He anstered that it vas not so necessary because

the volume vas so small. He was asked if he knew whether

any record or memorandum was made of such a request in

connection with the King case and responded that he did not

know; that he had no recollection, He was asked 1e it ras

possible that such a written racord might exist and if so,

Trould it not be in FBI files? He ansvered that he did not

think he could contribute to this question as almost anything

is possible. He added, horever, that he had no knowledge or

recollection of such a record or any knowledge of its

existence in FBI files.

He was then asked if he had ever heard of mailings

of tapes involving King. He replied that he had seen sonething

in a nerspaper irithin the past year or tro indicating such

an allegation. His recollection vas that the nets account

vas of a copy of a tape being mailed to Hrs. King, and that

Nirs. King hay denied receiving same.

relating it to denonstrations and the date of their occurrence.)

A:

I have never worked matters relating to demonstrations.

Furthermore, I had had no special interest in the

activities of DI. KING or the S,t.C. Since I have

little or no recollection of demonstrations in which

Dr. KING might have been involved, this method of

trying to jog my nemory would seem to be of little

help.

Mas the weather at the time of the monitoring cold

or trarm?

I seem to recall that the weather was warm, but

I am not sure.

Tere you told of the durpose of monitoring DI. KING?

I am not sure. So much of this is now a gray area

to me.

I do seem to recall asking for the reason

and being advised that this eas an internal

security matter and that, ned some indication

that Ds. KING was being influenced by persons tho

leaned toward the left.

Here you told that such peodle might be with Dr. KING?

I do not recall. I simply have the recollection

that our purpose ras to determine whether he was being

so influenced. I hasten to admit, horever, that I

am very hazy on this and it may very well be that he I

learned of these indications through conversations

even after the occurrence of our monitoring. I can

not be more specific in this regard.

Tho was with you at the time of the monitoring?

BILL CAMPBELL.

Tas anyone else involved?

I believe I did meet BILL BERGERON (phonetic) in

the lobby of the hotel. No one else to my

recollection.

Wolled you sign out from the office to go to the

hotel?

This would be the customary procedure, but whether

it was done in this instance I do not recall.

I associated voices I heard in the room to be that

I again associated voices heard with Mr. ABERNATHY,

another male from Baltimore those name I do not

was this the only monitoring being done at this tine?

Yes, as far as I know.

Did you make a log thile monitoring?

One could only take don very sketchy notes.

Did you thereafter go over the tapes and make up

1ogs?

Yes.

There was this done?

In an interview room of FO or some room set uD

for that purpose.

Regarding the time this monitoring took place, did

you leave the hotel for your home when finished?

Normal procedure would have been to return to the

office. I believe I returned to the office.

would it not be unusual for you to be returning

to the office, say at 1:00 a.m.?

No. I have done this on several occasions.

(Purpose here it seems vas to jog ny memory as to

the exact time of monitoring.)

Q:

"ere you involved in any of the reports or paper

work connected with this matter?

A:

No.

Then you monitored in other matters, vas it not

customary to knor the agent to thom a case tas

assigned? If so, tould you not then relate a

conversation overheard to that agent?

In the normal course of events, this would be true,

and the agent to whom the matter was assigned would

be so advised if the overheard conversation was

urgent in nature. In the matter of DI. KING, however,

I did not know the agent to whom the case as assigned.

Then you completed this monitoring, to whom did you

give your logs?

I do not recall; normal procedure would have been to

give them to my immediate supervisor, Mr. BELTER.

Getting back to the hotel, did you and ifs. CAMPBELL

leave together?

I do not recall. In all probability, ve did.

Did you carry the tapes and notes back to the office?

I do not recall. Either Mr. CAMPBELL of I did, or

are both may have. If I did carry them, I normally

rould have turned them over to the custody of

lir. BELTER.

You had no responsibility in regard to the equipment,

i.e., setting up, dismantling it, or returning it?

That is correct. ly function in thet matter was very

limited and I recollect I ras simply to go, monitor,

and return.

"ho gave you this assignment?

I believe it was Mr. BELTER.

I do not recall.

I feel it occurred in Mr. BELTER's

office which did not offer a good deal of privacy.

If anyone else was present, horever, it was

probably Mr. CAMPBELL.

Did you know the location of Dr. KING's hotel room

in regard to your location at the hotel?

A:

I do not recall, I do not think so.

The interview ended trith some questions in an attempt

to refresh my memory as to the actual date of the monitoring.

In substance, this is covered in my fifth anster under item

request by the Conmittee concerning mail cover infornation. He asked if I

could furnish him 3. time when he might expect our response to be delivered

to him. He pointed out that he had had previous discusions with me and

Mr. Shaheen of the Dopartment concerning this matter, and Vir. Shaheen

had indicated to nim that he could expect the responseto have been given to

him by this time. Mr. Wallach was informed that a tine certain for

delivery of a response concerning this request could rot be given, and it

was explained to him that a vast amount of material was being reviewed

pursuant to request of the Senate Select Committee and other committees of

Congress and that because of the amount of work invoked in all these requests

it was not possible to make a judgment as to the date a the response.

Mr. Wallach indicated he felt he had been nisied by Mr. Shaheen

into believing that he would have & response to his recest and that he was

going to recontact Mr. Shaheen. He made a general irquiry as to whether one

Agent might be gathoring all the information and as to whether he might be

allowed to come to FBI Headquarters and review whai has been gathered to

this point. He was informed that all disclosures have o receive proper

Bureau approval and that it would not be possible for l'm to review such

information in the absence of such approval. He askedif the Bureau could

separate the response by making available immediately portions of the mail

cover lists such as the identities of people who were the targets of mail

covers in the domestic field. He again was informed tat this was not

possible in the absence of proper approval. Mr. Wallah stated that he

wanted me to know that he was in possession of a list & Bureau mail covers

for the past five years which he had been furnished by i source whom he did

not identily, He was asked (1) if this list concerned the mail covers in the

national security areas and, (2) was it a national list. Mr. Wallach stated it

was & national list in the national security areas. He dated he was not sure

He was advised that the list would contain sensitive information

which would seriously impair ongoing Bureau investigations.

He replied that

the names were not classified, and since they were not classified he would

have no problem in using the list. It was explained to Mr. Wallach that

despite the fact it was not classified the list would be extremely sensitive

since it would impair many ongoing investigations and in many instances the

very fact that we are interested in an individual indicates that we are in

possession of sensitive information concerning that individual, Mr. Wallach

pointed out that if this were the case, acknowledging that he had been inforied

previously that one of the reasons for the necessity for closely reviewing the

material to be made available was because of this problem, then the Bureai

should come forward with its own list and point out to him which of the names

are sensitive and which are not. Mr. Wallach stated that only one or two

other people had knowledge of the fact he possessed such a list.

Committee - June 18, 1975 - 4:20 p.m.

Paul Wallach called O'Connor, but I took the call. Wallach

stated that his call to O'Connor was to express his personal

concern over O'Connor's questioning his (Wallach's) professional

ethics in an earlier telephone conversation with John Elliff of

SSC staff. Wallach expressed the hope that Schwarz's conversation

- with O'Connor in which Schwarz categorically disclaimed that Wallach

had made certain specific representations

to Paul Daly of the FBI

earlier, would put to rest all of 'Connor's concerns vis-d-vis

Wallach. (0'Connor's concerns were aroused by my report to him of

a Wallach call at about 3:00 p.m. to Daly in which Daly stated that

Wallach claimed that he (Wallach) 'had the NSC mail covers going

back five years" and had received same with names listed from a

source that Wallach refused to disclose. Daly further reported

that Wallach stated that unless the Bureau was not irmegiately

forthcoming with the SSC's request for the NSC mail covers, he

(Wallach) would use the ones in his possession.) I told Wallach

that I would convey his expression of concerm to 'Connor and that

Further, I requested that in the future, and for the good of ai

to me.

Leaving that subject, Wallach said he wished"to say soma

and that "it was to be off the record, of course"; he proceeded

state that, indeed, he does know someone with access to the NSC

covers and that that individual had offered him the list just t

days ago, but that for "obviously ethical reasons" he (Wallach)

refused the offer. Further, Wallach volunteered that "maybe I :

suggest that I had them (the NSC covers)" in his conversation !

Deputy Attorney General and Messrs. K. William O'Connor,

Kevin Maroney, Michael 'Shaheen and Robert McDermott, all of

the Department of Justice. The purpose of the meeting was

¡to discuss three specific matters the first being the draft!

Church and Tower (see memorandum Wannall to Adams captioned

as above dated 6/30/75). The second matter discussed was

the Task force concept.

found considerable difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of

the 6/25/75 letter pointing out that neither the Department of

Justice nor the FBI had entered into any agreement.

In view

of the ambiguities the Deputy Attorney General found in the

letter as well as the lack of any specific agreement entered into with

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Senstudy 75

62-116395

the Deputy Attorney General instructed that the Department

prepare a letter over the Attorney General's signature

asking for clarification of the 6/25/75 letter as well as

raising the question of any agreement entered into by the

Department or the FBI.

TASK FORCE CONCEPT

The Task Force concept is designed to identify

various abuses which the SSC desires to investigate in-depth.

A member of the intelligence community would be identified

to the Executive Branch as a

. Task Force leader. The purpose

would be to permit that Task Force leader to be completely

knowledgeable on all available information throughout the

intelligence community. for a particular abuse. In other

words, the White House could look to the Task Force leader

as the one person in the intelligence community who would be

privy to all information regarding a particular abuse. The

Deputy Attorney General had no problem with this concept but

did insist that the Task Force leaders should not negotiate

directly with their counterparts on the SSC on behalf of

the intelligence community for any particular abuse (Ihe

White House has insisted on this). The Deputy Attorney General

\instructed Mr. O'Connor to make this quite clear to

Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President,

and if Wilderotter insisted on unilateral negotiations between

Task Force leaders and the SSC, Wilderotter should be referred

to the Deputy Attorney General

in order to resolve this issue.

THE ROCKEFELLER COMMISSION FILES

As you know, the President has ordered that copies

of the Rockefeller Commission files including testimony be

turned over to the SSC. There has been no third agency

coordination on the part of CIA regarding what information

was turned over to the Rockefeller Commission. As a result

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

in the above we are not are that to the defeation

Commission by CIA.

The Criminal Division of the Department has received

copies of the entire Rockefeller Commission file plus testimony.

The Deputy Attorney General has ruled that these files and

testimony cannot be turned over to the FBI in toto until

such time as the Criminal Division has ruled on any possible

criminal culpability on the part of the FBI. To faciliate

the review of the Rockefeller Commission files, the Criminal

Division will separate out any informaion it feels involves

any FBI criminal culpability. That portion separated out

will be the subject of discussion between the Deputy Attorney

General and the Director. The remaining portion of the

Rockefeller files will then be turned over to the FBI for

review to determine if any of the information contained therein

could possibly jeopardize sensitive ongoing investigations

or adversely affect the security and welfare of FBI sources

mentioned therein.

The Legal Counsel Division is preparing a letter

alerting the SSC to the possibility that sensitive information

may be contained in the Rockefeller files and requesting that

Senators Church and Tower consider a briefing by FBI officials.

regarding those sensitive areas of concern to the FBI which

may be embodied in the Rockefeller Commission files.

ACTION:

For information.
