Since it appears that MIGUEL FONSECA RIVAS Involved

ENRIQUE PEREZ BONIN, his son ENRIQUE PEREZ SANCHO, and others

in an accusation that LEE HARVEY OSWALD had visited at PEREZ'

Hotel in Cuernavaca and they were involved in the plot to

assassinate President KENNEDY

out of spite, and since FONSECA

was in jail during the period when the subject was known to

be in Mexico (9/26/63 through 10/3/63), no additional investi-

gation is being conducted and, UACB, FONSECA will not be

interviewed.
