Informant determined on 8/14/61 a regular meeting of the

Dallas CP took place at the home of AUGUSTIN ESTRADA in West Dallas.

Present were AUGUSTIN ESTRADA, BILL LOWERY and JOE LANDIN.

ESTRADA stated that coming down to business he did not see

any logic in meeting any mare.

• It was a waste of time for all

involved including the state committee.

The Dallas group had not

functioned in more

than five years, functioned properly that is.

BILL LOWERY agreed that the party had been at a standstill

for a long time and attributed its shortcomings to the lack of the

group getting together.

Through the discussion he insisted that this

was what had killed the organization.

He cited some work he and wor

LANDIN had done in different organizations explaming the local CP was

not at a complete standstill. ESTRADA said he was referring to the

CP as a group. The work they had done was on an individual basis.

Even at that, LoWERy replied the work could be credited to the CP.

ESTRADA stated that he wanted

to quit mainly because

@1

this reason:

he had given much thought

to what LOWERY said

about

protecting his boy.

LOWERY'S boy is

the service.

In & previous

mesting, LOWERY advised hin he definitely did not want to

be a

delegate to the state Committee and

would no longer attend state

Committee meetings. His boy was in the service and it be

(LOWERY)

was

ever identified ass big wheel in the CP, he was sure to ruin

his

son's career.

He would

rather remain just & member.

For this

reason, AUGUSTIN

stated,

how could they stand by and have JOHN STAN-

FORD persecuted when they as the local CP had not accomplished any

thing:

there was no cause for it.

LOWERY said he still stood by his

decision if he remains a delegate when the tine came for

• their

exposure as CP members be

was sure to be identified as the CP head

of the State of Texas - it had happened to him before. .

Once in the

past he was

accused of heading the CP in Texas • he and ELWOOD ROSS,

they

claimed,

were the state leaders - not ESTES.

LOWERY did not

specify who his accusers were.

He asked LANDIN to give his opinion

on the

status of

the Party.

LANDIN said he would continue to work

as usual.

He was working on a project now. Before then he was

working on anotber one..

He had always managed to keep busy.

he worked on

an individual basis.

As LOWERY had said his work could

be credited to the Party.

The local CP, LANDIN continued, had not

recruited anyone

in years.

He for one had a good number of harris.

books, pamphlets, etc. He didn't have any use for them - it was

shameful too for

he imagined active CP members could make use of

As it was he was going to burn them. LOWERY said he had

sold

$8.35 worth of Marxist literature.

He wanted to look through JO's Marsist literature and pick

up some of it he could sell. LANDIN said he could.

LANDIN asked what the status

of the

local CP was.

Both

ESTRADA

and LOWERY said there was no use deceiving

themselves there

wasn't a Party. LOWERY felt the next thing to do was to take

the

subject to the state Committee.

LANDIN asked for what to notify

them of AUGUSTIN's plans or to discuss it.

His point was, would

anything they or the committee say change his mind?

ESTRADA said

they were obligated to the state Committee. They had responsibility

and he would in the near future meet with JOHN STANFORD and would,

after that, contact JOE LANDIN and BILL LOWERY.

BILL LOWERY reported he had

attended a

couple of meetings

with the Forum,

social, where

he had

heard i. D. GARCIA

speak concerning the dinnerodance honoring ser. GONZALEZ.

"He also

reported that he had

visited

WIth JOIN STANFORD in San Antonio.

STANFORD, LANDIN

said, had nored

and wondered how LowerY contacted

LowERY said he called the operator from Dallas, got his

number, and called

to make sure he would be there.

STANFORD WSS

ESTRADA said he did not know STANFORD's address or phone

number and did not know where to call him It that was so, LANDIN

asked, now could he contact hin to meet wich bim.

ESTRADA

said he

would write to another address and the letter would be torwarded

to bim.

LOWERY said the letter LANDIN wrote on Cuba (8/14/61,

"DALLAS TIMES HERALD) WaS y

good one.

LANDIN said he regretted

writing it, for while trying

to point

out the folly of war and the

prejudiced

views of some people, he had done more harm than good.

His wife was terribly upset remembering the hysteria the last

U. S. hijacked plane caused.

She pointed out the harm the letter

could do to their children.

They would be ostracized or persecuted

by the children at school, and what of their teachers? She added

that after a letter by LANDIN approved in the press, some children

(quite sometime ago, that played with their children, never returned

to play again.

LANDIN said he had not giverit much thought, or

else he would

not have written it. LANDIN said his wife alse brought

up the question of crack-pots they could barm, and after all they

lived in a corner, next door to them the house was

Macant and an

alley was behind them, in short they were exposed.

LANDIN said

that while otbers

were free to write what they pleased he would

write letters of that nature any more. AUGUSTIN ESTRADA and BILI

LOwERY said that if they could help in some way they would do it.

Informant had no additional information.
