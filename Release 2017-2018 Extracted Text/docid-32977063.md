Present: Mr. McGeorge Bundy, Mr. Robert Kennedy, Mr.

Alexis Johnson, Mr. Paul Nitze, Mr. John McCone, MI. Donald

Wilson, General I. W. Parker, General Edward G. Lansdale.

The Group was informed of the contents of the attached memo-

randum recording a 28 March meeting of the operational represen-

tatives. General Lansdale pointed out that the psychological

activities were within existing policy and would be developed as

indicated. The "food for prisoners" proposal was presented as

requiring policy approval.

MI. Wilson noted that a press statement had not been issued

since none of the families in the Miami area had been reported as

planning to return to Cuba. MI. Johnson said that State had not

made the decision, as reported. MI. Kennedy commented that the

decision was made in a strange way, since he had agreed to I&NS

permitting re-entry upon State's representation to him that the

action was ready to go, except for that permission.

General Lansdale alerted the Group, for the particular atten-

tion of the FBI and CIA, that the situation among refugees in south-

ern Florida was explosive, that undetected Communist agents

among the refugees there could turn emotional demonstrations

into riots very damaging to the U.S.

On "food for prisoners," the Group decided that State would

explore promptly the possibility of a 3rd country ambassador

approaching Castro privately on behalf of private relief agencies,

the legality of using PL 480 surplus foods for this purpose, and

the private relief organizations which would undertake such a

delivery.

General Lansdale then reported that
