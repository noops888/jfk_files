Ill

a high-class lawyer, the joint civic groups

are all behind him.

SO I (D'ARCO) sent foi

GIROLAMI and I said you better get your friend

and find out why they (obs), he's you're friend

and he's asking more questions about you then

hes asking about me.

You know MOE

that you and

GIROLAMI were seen together in that car that night.

They tailed ya.

GIANCANA:

They didn't see me, there

wasn't nobody around.

FRANK ANNUNZIO, operator of the Lake Personnel Service

and Democratic Ward Committeeman of the First Ward of Chicago in

1944 and State Director of Labor for the State of Illinois under

Governor ADLAI STEVENSON, was interviewed on 1/23/62 by SAs HILL

and ROEMER concerning his relationship with GIANCANA, MURRAY

HUMPHREYS, ET AL; however, the interview was conducted on the

pretext of soliciting his cooperation in view of the fact that he,

ANNUNZIO, was a well-respected Italian businessman and leader

of several Italian civic groups.

He is the Chairman of the

Villa Scalabrini Old Peoples Home and is Director of the Italian

Welfare League.

During the interview ANNUNZIO expressed a

desire to cooperate fully with the interviewing Agents and

bemoaned the fact that the respectable Italian-American

professional and businessman is not in a position to force out

the old Ward politicians who are obviously backed by the Chicago

syndicate, namely JOHN D'ARCO and ANTHONY GIROLAMI, D'ARCO

states in the above conversation that ANNUNZIO was questioned

about GIROLAMI's current position in Chicago's politics where

the reverse is true.

ANNUNZIO initiated the conversation'

pertaining to GIROLAMI and expressly asked the question of the

interviewing Agents as to "why is GIROLAMI in the position he is

in today?

I'll tell you why. He was tapped on the shoulder

and was hand picked by certain individuals." He described

GIROLAMI as probably the worst example to his knowledge of an

Italian-American politician hand picked by the syndicate to

look after their affairs.

SA ROEMER immediately after D'ARCO

10211 2ctaG ROLANT,

GIROLAMI, who is CG 6498-PC, contacted

advised him that ANNUNZIO

had been interviewed by Bureau Agents and advised SA ROEMER

essentially of the conversation which took place above.

reason for ANNUNZIO deliberately lying to D'ARCO concerning the

context of the interview is unknown; however, one possibility

is that he may be attempting to gain D'ARCO's confidence while

at the same time cooperating with the Bureau Agents.

ANNUNZIO

has been assigned symbol number CG 6514-PC as possible development

under the top echelon criminal informant program. The conversation

then continues as follows:
