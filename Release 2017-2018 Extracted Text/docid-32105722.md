MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION

PARTICIPANTS:

President Ford

DI. Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of State

and Assistant to the President for

National Security Affairs

Lt. General Brent Scowcroft, Deputy Assistant

to the President for National Security Affairs

DATE AND TIME:

Saturday, April 12, 1975

11:45 a.m.

PLACE:

Oval Office

Kissinger: The press at David Brinkley's dinner last night was saying

that if you went to Dubuque, the reception for you with that message

[to Rabin] would be great. They asked about your mood, and were you

trying to separate yourself. I said I thought you were at peace with

yourself.

Braden said he asked Colby if he could deny there had been any

assassinations or plans for them. He said, no. Colby must go.

President: I agree. It is a matter of who and when. I want to go into

the country.

Couldn't I weave into the bicentennial something about our foreign

policy?

Kissinger: I have been thinking after last night; I don't have to give a

major speech each time. Just talk for 20 minutes.

President: That's right. The impact is you saying it. The thrust is

we have to be strong.

Kissinger: We can take sections from your (State of the World] speech

The people last night think within a year there will be

an enormous backlash. This Congress is really McGovern's, because

of Watergate. Osborne thought your speech was great and the pardon

was one of the most courageous things you have done. The press is

out of touch with the country.

President: The local press. Not out in the country.

Kissinger: The press is out of touch. Now that the Israelis have taken

us on this year

-- this year rather than next -- we maybe have the

opportunity.. We maybe should go for all the marbles.

President: Any reaction from Greece and Turkey to my speech?

Kissinger: The Turks are delighted. The Greeks are too, but they

wanted the money under the table.

President: We haven't heard anything from Brezhney.

Kissinger: Hamilton said he would introduce something.

I told Javits if he is a Jewish spokesman he had to talk to me as

an American and what is in it for the United States.

Israel has done something again I would like to protest about.

I told Allon about your talk with Schmidt, to show them the concern

about Portugal. Now it is in the Israeli papers. I told Allon about

them going to the Germans to contact the Europeans. They [the

Israelis] in doing it this way make it look as if they are going behind

our backs.

Egypt is afraid of an attack. I think we should tell them if it

happens we will formally dissociate.

President: Should we tell the Israelis that?

Kissinger: When Allon is here.

Three out of five speeches now on foreign policy would be good.

Rallying the people should be the theme. We should stress the last

part of the speech, but not avoid Vietnam either.

President: Is the Vice President going to go?

Kissinger: He doesn't want to.
