UNUSUAL TACHNIQUE

INSTALZATION OF MICROPMONE SURVEILLANCS

JUNE

KANSAS CITY DIVISION

The Bureau will be interested in the ingenious

techniques and procedures

utilined by SA GEORGE D. ADANS

to install & aisur at the Origiaal Toy and Jobbing Compuny,

305 West 3th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.

This installa

tion was authorized

by Bureau letter, dated 11/2/61,

captioned NICHOLAS CIVILIA, aln, Anti-Rackoteering:

Transmitted herewith are three photostatie copies

of diagrams chowing nethod by which installation was

accomplished and one 1200 foot reel of ungnetle recording

tape, recorded at 3 3/ inches por second, an example of

quality of Intolligibility obtained through thia

installation,

It was deterulned that installation would be

made to covor office area of Store "*" (Diagram one)..

Through developnent of confidential source, Store "y" was

rented under cover of business ilen, to be

utilized as

storage space for merchandise.

The area in which these stores are located is

an older business section and the two are divided by a

connon wall of solld brick and plaster, 27 inches thick.

Through legal access to store "y", the plan was te bore

through this wall at caseboard lavel to cover the area o&

the office space

• In Store "X*

On closer scrutiny, after project was bogun, it

determined that there were two chinney flues within

separating brick wall, ono at the rear and one at the

front of the building (Diagram one) •

These were no longer

In use, Inasnuch as the beating plant had been converted

from a coal furnace to a gas furnace. It was found that

chimney flue "B"

(Diagrama two and three) was in an ideal

location with respect to the olfice area of Store "*",

where coverage was desired.

As a result,

to accomplish the desired penetration

of the connon wall, it was only necessary to remove one thickness

of bricke from the

wall identified as X1 and Y1 (Diogran three).

Tals allowed

access directly to the baseboard of the

office space in Store "X" and two mites, connected to separate

leased lines were concealed in are fl; an air passage

was

made through the plaster to the back

of the baseboard, and

vertically to the top of the baseboard in area X1.

The

lines from the mitos were run to

the basement

area of Store "y" through chimney flue "g" and

fron there to

• the plant.

Insulation was placed in the flue above areas

In to 81

to avoid

possible air

flow noise; the bricks were replaced and

mortared.

The mites were connected binaurally at the plant.

This was done

to allow the gain control on the individual

amplifiors at the plant to be set at a mininum, thereby decreasing

line noise without curtailing intelligibility.

Farther, it

was felt that this type of installation would

prolong the life

of the equipment, and each could be operatod monaurally in the

event there was

failure of one of the instrumants.

It is felt that the method used in making

• this

installation and the means of egress might bo of interest of

the Electronics Section and other field divisions, where similar

problens of penetration are encountered.

This is

crue particularly

in older type business buildings separated by & common wall,

where in many instances,

the heating plant has been converted

from coal to gas.

The abandoned chimney flues thereby offer

an excellent means to an end.

It is further pointed out in connection with this

installation; at Kansas City that because of legal access to

Store "Y", where nork was being done, it was possible to test

different' typos of equipment in various combinations to dotermine

which offered the best results, prior to sealing the opening

permanently.

The tape recording transmitted herewith is no longer

needed at Kansas City and may be disposed of by the Electronics

Section when it has served its purpose.
