1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 5 April 1968 agreement

was reached that the KOFIRM relationship with her would be terminated.

A memorandum of contact (MYM-2689) concerning the meeting is attached

herewith, and indicates the reasons for this termination.

No admin

istrative action is required of either the Base or Headquarters

in this inctance, so LImory/! 190 not being raid bi do tomor did

was formally terminated once before (1966).

Her file can be retired,

• again, and

this time presumably will be the last time.

Termination was very amicable, and LICOOKY/1 nolds no ill-

will for WOFIRM:

she just does not wish

to have any relationship

with WOFIRM anymore.

3.

The writer fully expects to hear from LICOOKY/1 from time

to time by phone (in fact, she called later the same day of the

meeting to wish the writer a pleasant Easter, as she had forgotten

to do so during the meeting), but does not plan any further personal

contact.

I knew something was bothering LICOOKY/l änd made her

drag

it out into the open. i She staired by renarking thai kOFIRy

and its computer apparently checked the welfare of its old agents

every to often, and that this was the nature of our relationship.

I explained that this was not the case.

that I had found out she

was in Manhattan

and suggested to washington that LICCOKY/1

might be of some value to us.

This surprised her, and she apolo-i

gized. She then took off on how when she was in Cubaiste had

dealt with Fidel

and Che and Celia, and when s-e was invoived

with Guatemala she was dealing with AREVALO. She said that she

didn't want to sound snobbish, but that she

was accustoned to

dealing with top politicos and intellectuais; she referisa to a

statement that I had made previously that perhaps she couid get

Tana de GAMEZ to invite her aiong to one of Tana's lunches with

Cuban Permanent Representative Ricardo ALAïCO* Quesada.

She said

that she didn't ware NOFIRM to thirk that she would seek out and

cultivate lower level people, that she wasn't built that way.

LICOOKI/1 said thai even though Tana was a frierd and that she

Jaked ner, Tana was not ner ecuad, ano that jare wash i

'on her

pedestal".

That MARCON was certainiy not in i-coOkY/l's intellectual

category.

LIC00XY/1 said that she considered hasseli as very flexible.

but not that much.

LICOOKX/1 is a "specia: person" and that

WOFIR" bureaucracy - with the exceptions of "Biil" let Mexico

case officer, a friend of the writeri, C/iü/l (with wom

• LICOOKY/L

is particularly taxen), aná the writer (LICOOKY/1 repeatedly assured

me that she had & very sincere estees for me) - probably didn't

understard or acknowledge this.

LICOCKY/l said her feelings for

certain vOIRkers were one thing, but her dislike of WOrIR! itself

• was souething else.

WOFIRM is

a massive card index that shows Miguel

Angel ASTURIAS as an old "Nicaraguan war-horse" -- ASTURIAS

OÊ

course is Guatemalai. LICOOKY/1 couicn't stop liking Communists

regaraless of WOFIt: desires.

LICOOKY/l went on and on in this/similar veins.

impassioned, but very straightforward and withour personal rancor

Sunning up, the stäted reasons as to why she coes

. not wish to continue regular collaboration with NOFIRY are as

toblows:

B.

fear of compromise - LICCOKY/1 said that were her

relationship with us to becone known,

she could call that office 1f contact were necessary while

The list Includes many well

mom Mexican Communists and pro-Cornists. Attached also (Attachment C) 18 a

by the Mexican Cormittee for the Desense of the Jews in the USSR, in wich a

meder Of demands are zade on the Soviet Governnent with respect to the Jews and

their righta.

La Voz de Nexico, 15 May 1956 (Attachment E) carried an article bitterly

attacking the Conference, which it charges is being organized and held by groups

and persons in the service of ODACID.

It specifically nemes LICOOKY-1, elthough

the latter's care is iccorrectly spelled, as one of those responsible for the

Conference and says she is "well corected" with ODYOKE police. Sucesos,

21 Key 1966, carried an article (Attechment F) attacking the Conference and 1ts

deny that she had had anything to do with the Conference

CONTINUATION-OF DISPATCH

HMMA -29207

To The Station belleves that nost or all articles attacking the Conference,

and particularly those attacking LICOOKY-1, were Boviet IIspired, and It is further

belleved that SEMD wrote nost 1l not all articles attacking the Conference which

appeared in La Voz, Politica ard SucecoE. The soviets, uno are probably avare of

previous Cuban charges trat LICOOKY-l is an ODYOKE agent, probably felt that as

an Anerican closely essociated with the ARIAC LICOOKY-I sould be vulnerable to

such an attack.

8. As a result of the Sucesos article of 4 June 1966 an official Iron the

Ministry of Government did vialt LICOOKY-l to check on ker documentation.

The

officiel said that he did not belleve the charges made in the Sucesos article,

but since her tourist visa had expired he edvined her to incediately leave the

coustIy in order to rerew it, end he provided her with a letter to show to

Mexican border authorities peraitting her exit.

She is currently In PEPRIE but

9. As Headquarters 1s aware, LICOOKY -1 vill be terrinated effective

30 Jure 1966; the decision to terminate her vas made sose time ago, prior to the

occurrence of the Concerence and the resultine adverse propezanda.

believed thet the recent adverse propagenda has impaired ser future use ulness

in Nexiso, although zany lexicans undoubtedly do not belleve the charges and

others offered to

"cose to her defense."

completed, end sny ses developments with respect to her alleged pariicipation 1a

1. Production

#. LICOOKY-l has continued to devote the bulk of her

time to the

Mexican Writers' Association (AKM). She

cortinues to

handle most of its administrative work.

She also organizes and does most of the work on the

majority of the projects or activities which the

AEN sponsors.

b.

I-l continued to report on efforts to establiah the

Latin Anerican Mriters' Community (CLE), Including

the results of the Organizing Congress in Arica, Chile.

She reported on the steps taken by Mario Monteforte

•Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967

Congress in Mexico and on the All's probable role in

helping organize that Congress.

c. InI supplied information on resctions among the Cen-

tral America, cormunity in Mexico to the Guatemalan

election campaign and results.

She maintained contact "ith and reported on individuals

os lateroat to the stattor, ineluding pontetorte solado,

e. LIC00KY-2 continued to roport travel of Communinte

or leftists from Central America to Eastern Europe.

During this period he reported on eight such travelers.

2. Operations

= Il has been notifled that she will be terminated

effective 30 June. She has been given the following

requirements to be fulfilled before that date.

Pairina pictican an on: I0=20na919a and 5021112a 29

and progress toward the holding of its scheduled meet-

1ng in Mexico City In January 1987.

tivities at the All. There are enough jobs that

need doing at All to occupy her full-time and there-

fore the lamedinte partial withdrawnl from ASM work

1s a prerequisite to the accomplishment of these

assignments.

Because I-l has played such a ley role in all AF

activities, and therefore in determining the direc-

tion and scope of these actiritles, her sudden with-

ama cortel some in important changes althin AEl.

Any major change in direction by All would probably

become predictable once the identity of the person

or persons who uill nove in to fill the vacancy left

by Il become know. By having Ll step aside now,

rather than walting until she is ready to leave lexico,

she may then be able to provide S:ation with an ac

curate account of any change resulting from her with

drawal.

passport.

Her explanation for requesting the passport is

for making a trip to Costa Rica.

Sakolowska claims that

the passport aprilialive is von 1n the State Morartment

"Security Section".

Sakolowska also told LICOOKY-l that the "Prensa

Latina

Bureau Chief" had proposed to her an apparent intel

ligence mission to accomplish enroute to Cuba.

She believes

this mission is to take piace in Miami. LICOOKY-1 reported

that on 7 February Sakolowska had a luncheon engagement

with "someone" at the United Nations and speculates it may

be to pick up a package to take to someone in Cuba. LICOOKY-1

further speculates that this may onlj be a gift to someone

in Cuba.

LICOOKY stated that she had no additional information®

It should be noted, however, that this item was given in a

last minute rush just prior to her departure from the writer:

LICOOKY-1 expects to be in New York until the end of February.

LICOOKY-] states that Sakolowska has been a long-tine

"left

winger".

LICOOKY-1 reported earlier on Sakolowska and

her connections with revolutionaries in Central America and

Havana in dispatch HIDIA 27924 dated 21 September 1965 pages

4 and 6.

This office is planning no further action on this

matter and in line with the writer's telephone conversation

with Frank Hughes of the CI Staff today, we understand your

office will be coordinating the Subject

Jack,

I briefed

for 30 minutes on LICOOKY

giving him the full background on her sio,

education, CIArelationship---fron recruit-

ment through current use in Mexico.

My

suggestion was that she be told to

go to

NY and find a job which would give her a

means of livelihood as well as cover for any

future CIA income.

After 6 months (or some

other specific period of time it would be

arranged that either we contact her or she

contact us to determine what her personal

situation was

and whether she would then be

in a position to target against selected

persons of interest to CIA

Sto conte ice ice

for herCIA work.

wanted to

think about it but thought that this would

be the best approach.

He will talk to you

before Friday.

His only question was whether we had any

• Indication whether she was under develop-

nent by the opposition-Soviet, Cuban, etc.

I told him that as far as I knew there was

no süch fadiestion

15 i am wrong (per

your and

recent activity)

you better correct this.

• Reference la made to you oral a Garn pated States

Government, as represented by the Contractng Officer.

Arrangemento have been recently completed allowing certain

Endependent contractora of this organization to obtain social security

credits by covering such individaals under the social security tax

provisions applicable to employees.

These arrangements also inclade

• provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the

1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since

the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the

«elf-employed rate to the employee rate. for example, in January

of 1965 the lax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% re-rectively.

As a consequence aereol, did consIaci in amended by icieiing

all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:

"Ellective 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly

deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same

manner and to the same extent as would be done ll you were & Govern-

ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Ita

implementation does not imply ir any manner the actual creation of an

employce -employer relationship.

Your legal status under thie agree -

ment continues to be that of an independen; contractor.

Il you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security

credite from overt soarces you will so notify this organization and an

djustment will be made on covert deductione discontinued, depending

mon the circuratances. Further, If you shonid subsequently receive

overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this

organisation. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your

• covert deductions returned.

All other terme and conditions of said contract remain in full force

and effect.
