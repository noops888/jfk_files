SUBJECT: United States v. Joseph Bonanno, et al.

The Attorney in charge of the subject case has been

attempting to obtain copies of the flight manifest records

for Mohawk Airlines' flights from Newark, New Jersey, to

Binghamton, New Jork on November 14, 195%. He is particularly

interested in the morning and early afternoon flights.

21 1959

An official of the Airline has advised that the records

for that day have been lost or destroyed.

The same official

has expressed the belief that these records were examined by

Bureau agents. In the event that this is so and copies of these

manifests are in the possession of the Bureay, we should like to

have them for use at the trial.

3

In addition, if the Bureau has any other copies of

flight manifests pertaining to the Apalachin gathering, we

would appreciate receiving

This would include Trafficant's

flight from Miani, Larocca's and Genovese's flight from Pitts-

burgh and De Simone's and Scozzari's flight from Los Angeles.

5

An attempt is also being made to locate the originals

or copies of records of the hotel Frederick, indicott, New York,

for November 13 and 14, 1957. The New lork State Police advise

they did not take the originals or obtain copies of them.

copies have been obtained by the Bureau, we would appreciate

receiving them.
