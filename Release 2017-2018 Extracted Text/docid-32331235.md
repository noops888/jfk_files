said that he has known the subject on a

fairly close basis except for the last three years. He

said

he would not classify TOURINE a top echelon hoodlum and

explained this statement by saying that some years

ago,

he

made a real killing with a bookmaker in NYC

and was owed a huge sum of money.

The bookmaker refused

was regarded

as a top echelon hoodlum, he could have forced the bookmaker

to come up with the money..
