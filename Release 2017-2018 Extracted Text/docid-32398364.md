FROM CI Specialist/OS

SUBJECT:

ROSNEK, George M.

Bross

1. In regard to the several lump sums of money given to

Subject since 1969, the undersigned has in general avoided specific

instructions or statements to Subject in regard to what he should do

with the money. However, a distinct effort has been made in a some-

what indirect manner to limit the amount of money irretrievably spent

by Subject.

2. The following is a general report on the present financial

condition of Subject and how the major portion of the money received

by Subject since 1 April 1969 (above regular salary) has been spent:

$8, 000.00 circa 1 May 1969 - spent for purchase

of furniture and household effects.

$25,000.00 circa 1 July 1970 - $5, 000.00 spent

in moving, purchase of additional household effects,

etc., and $20, 000.00 down payment on residence.

Total purchase price of residence circa $45,000.00.

Present remaining on mortgage circa $24, 000.00. On

this residence, Subject has a valid sales agreement

which because of the current mortgage money situation

(interest ceiling) cannot be completed. Purchase price

is $63, 000.00 with $5, 000. 00 deposit and one year from

1 October 1973 for purchaser to fulfill contract. If

contract is. not completed in the year, purchaser loses

deposit (1/2 to Subject and 1/2 to real estate company).

In the meantime, there is a valid rental agreement

effective 1 October 1973 at the rate of $450.00 per

month which is completely separate from the contract

to purchase.

From lump sum money received by Subject in the

latter part of 1972 and 1973, Subject purchased three

large lots located on a canal to open water in Oriental,

North Carolina. Total purchase price was $15, 000.00

and the current list price for similar lots is about

$9,000.00 per lot. Investment in the new residence

is circa $70,000.00 (not including price of lots) and there

is no encumbrance on this property. There is adequate

reason to believe the above property is currently worth

$100,000.00 or more. The automobiles of Subject are

paid for and he owes about $9, 000. 00 to be paid out of

the approximately $35,000. 00 equity in original residence

when sales contract is completed.

3. In general terms, Subject, when sales contract on

previous residence is completed, will have his current property

fully paid for, owe nothing on personal effects and have $25, 000. 00

as a financial reserve which he intends to place in a Savings and Loan

facility or in three or more Time Deposits.
