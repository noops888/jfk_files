no this could not be true because one was a Jew, that it is definitely

a group of Fascists, very Amerioan, he is owner of a Cabaret of nudists

and belongs to political gangsters. Ceollia says it is absurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering jail where OSWALD was). Julieta says

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with the

police and newspapermen.

It was perfectly planned, indeed some of the

Cecilia agrees, the ploture is evidence of that because the police

did not move to try to got in or anything for within a question of

they found this character (Ruby) drinking Coca Colsion,

Julieta belleves that this is all done by extreme rightists planned from

very high up and that is why they had to kill OSWALD so he couldn't talk.

Julieta adds that she hopes they will wakerupa little with this business

and pay attention to what has happened because it 1s evident it 1s all a

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men.

She adds that In a very

She adds that each

Likewise she indicates that all the speeches givon try to imply that he

3) At 1215 hrs Mexi time 27 Nov., CAS officer Has

However, Echeverria later told LEGAT that he had decided to rearrest

Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above)

Increased surveillance of her activities.

Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he had any

specific concrete evidence that she was

about to leage for Cuba, We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate.

It is quite possible, and even probable, that contra-

dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play down Importance

of OSWALD visit here. Mexi line still is that OSWAht, visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only interested in finding

That reservation is respected under normal

conditions until two hours before departure time; however, in the event

all seats are not

filled, it may be held until the actual departure of the bus.

Prior to the departure of

the bus, a final check is made of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that

particular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communioates by radio to the company

headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers on the bus in relation to the

advised that he prepared most of

"OSWLD" and destination "lared"

He stated that he did not write the "OSWLD" reservation Info

and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and tabbinfo recorded by the

baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ. ALVARADO 1s quite certain at thorpresent time

that the

Individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchases ticket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest. No tioket number was reporded for that

MEMO FOR THE RECORD from Flannery (C/CA) - Elena, GARRO told Eunice Odio (who relayed to

the period she now finds out that OSWALD was here in Mexi priorato the assassination.

was invited by & Mexi secretary in the Cub Emb whose husband 4s a cousin of the GARRO

family (Horacio DURAN????)!

At the party, she say three Gringos, not drinking, not mixing,

and more or less just standing around together like "three bumps on a log"

They were so

obviously out of place, she asked someone; In the Cub. Emb about them and was told that "they

were just passing zin through". She claims that on account of the way these three gringos

stood out she took a good long look at them as did her daughter. When assassination occurred

and OSWALD's picture was spread into the newspapers,

both Elena and her daughter immediately

said that he was one of the three gringos

"without

a doubt" at the party.

Note covering above memo tol COSs

Do lyou want me to send the gist of this to Has?

he had forgotten to report. The release of the Warren Comm|Report reminded him of the inci-

dent. / The scientist said he had been at the Havaha airport on afternoon of 22 Nov 63 when

at 1700 hrs an aircraft with Mexi markings landed and parked at far side of the field.

Two men, whom he recognized as Cuban& gangsters" alighted, enteredurear entrance of

damnistration biag and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures.

His

curlosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had just arrived from

Dallas, Texes, via TiJuana and Mext City. The plane had been fórced to land at TIjuana due

to engine trouble.. By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men misti have been involved in assassination..

He speculated thet OSWALD had acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

In pallas to organize or oversee the operatioh. He told the source that he had been greatly

distressed by what he had seen and heard and had to telll someone about it. He then cautloned

ElVira VARGAS, leftist Journalist with NOVEDADES

personal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;

Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin

A Canedo, head of publishing firm

called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORIANO, pain

who was invited to make her feel at

ease, since he is & friend of hers and was

ther

During evening, Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she dec

bed as intelligent and cultured, concen-

trated his attention on her......ánd expressed

interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.

He issued & personal Invitation to her to

ttend the annual literary festival of the Casa

Was not a Fidelista and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb HERNANDEZ then invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro regime over the objections of the others present...../ Later, her friend,

Victor RICO Galen who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ, warned her not to go to Cuba alone.

/ On 4 July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre In

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and some printed matter from the Casa

de las Americas In Havana.

The first letter, written last October (667) gave her address

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written in April, gave her address as Vermont 39.

The envelope for the first letter, with the above address, was marked for return to the

sender, which was the Cub Emb here.

The second envelope, which contained the whole pkg,

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments.

/ Elena stated

the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was

because

she spent severel

days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination.

The correct address of the hotel is

Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor
