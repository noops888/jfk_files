called training in kidnapping consisted of and has no

idea whatsoever that these two individuals are returning

to the U.S., however, he also stated that in his

opinion, both these men would cooperate with the U.s.

authorities should they be returned to the U.s.

This opinion, regarding their willingness to

cooperate with the U.S. authorities, is based

strictly on his own sad and allegedly uleppy experience

as a hijacker in Cuba. RAMIREZ alleges that he was

not well treated in Cuba after arriving in Cuba as a

hijacker

It is also pointed out that RAMIREZ volunteered

this information prior to receiving the 20 year

sentence from Judge MEHRTENS at Miami. RAMIREZ

did quite a bit of publicizing about how good it is to

be here in the U.S. again and how terrible things are

in Cuba.

He might have volunteered the information

about FRESE and COLON to establish a favorable

relationship with the FBI.U

Miami file 164-208 describes a LUIS ANTONIO FRESE

as a white male, born 9/16/29 at San Juan Puerto Rico,

who was confined on 5/20/67 after conviction for violation

of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 2312.

LUIS ENRIQUE RUIZ COLON is the subject of

Bureau file 42-155160 and San Juan file 42-593. He is.

described as the only son of Puerto Rican parents, born

12/31/39 at Utuado, Puerto Rico, not known to be associated

with the independence movement.

He volunteered to be

inducted into the U.S. Army in 1960 and was inducted

in August of 1960.

He deserted while in training in

South Carolina.

He later travelled to Cuba and his

mother and father sold their properties to travel to

Cuba to be with him.

The LUIS RUIZ COLON and LUIS FRESE referred

to by ANTULiO RAMiREz are very probably identical with

LUIS ANTONIO FRESE and LUIS ENRIQUE RUIZ COLON referred

to above. "

ANTULIO RAMIREZ had no indication that

either FRESE or COLON are going to return to the U.S.

(or Puerto Rico) but did state that the policy of the

Government of Cuba toward U.S. citizen hijackers held

in Cuba, was,

as of November of 1975, to allow them to

return to the U.S.

RE: ANTULIO RAMIREZ ORTIZ

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

OBTIFIDENTLAL

Information concerning the captioned

Individual, hereafter referred to as RAMIREZ, was

previously submitted in a report, captioned "ANTULIO

RAMIREZ ORTIZ, also known as - FUGITIVE, INTERNAL

SECURITY - CUBA, INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN

AIRCRAFT - KIDNAPPING; CRIME ON THE HIGH SEAS - ASSAULT",

at Miami, dated December 4, 1975. U

On March 4, 1976, RAMIREZ was sentenced to

20 years in federal prison

by U.S. District Court

Judge WILLIAM MEHRIENS. U

RAMIREZ was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico

on November 20, 1926, and served in the Korean War.

He hijacked a National Airlines airplane on a Miami -

Key West flight, May 1, 1961, the first airplane hijacking

in the U.S.

In an article he wrote for the Spanish language

magazine,

"Replica"; published in Miami, RAMIREZ

states that he was interviewed at length by Cuban G-2

(Intelligence) Agents on his arrival in Havana, after

hijacking the airplane.

He had numerous odd jobs in

Havana, until he visited the Swiss Embassy in Havana,

Cuba during the October crisis in 1962, when he decided

1л 1GT0.2.і

that he should side with the U.S. in case of a confrontation

between the U.S. and Russia. The G-2 photographed

everybody that visited the Swiss Embassy, he said, and

was later arrested on a charge of espionage, in Santiago,

Cuba, on September 26, 1963. Thirty-six days later, he

was freed, temporarily and re-arrested May 24, 1965,

after having visited the Swiss Embassy several times.

RAMIREZ was then sentenced to a term of three years in

Principe Frison, where there were over 11, 000 prisoners

While at La Cabana, he stated,

while

between 1965 and 1968, over 100 people were shot, usually

at 9:00 PM each day. l

On August 22, 1972, he tried to escape from

cuba via a raft, but was found at sea by a crew aboaro

the fishing boat "Los Facos", taken back to Cuba and

sent back to jail for another three years. U

on August 2, 197 a antens no hoste a

leave Cuba were

housed. He was put on board a plane

on November 11, 1975 bound for Jamaica, and given $150

for some clothing.

The policy then, he said, was to

let the hijackers

lege cuba.

While free on bond, prior to sentencing, in

Miami, RAMIREZ worked at Murray's Restaurant, Coral

Gables, Florida. His wife, ALTAGRACIA, resides at 11415

Venice Boulevard, Apartment 6, Los Angeles, California,

90066.

On January 3, 1976, RAMIREZ advised a Special

Agent of the FBI that he was always regarded with suspicion

in Cuba since his arrival there

He was always

suspected of being a Criminal Intelligence Agency or

FBI "plant" (who would evertually begin furnishing

information to the U.S.) Therefore, he bad no

opportunity to learn about Cuban Intelligence matters.
