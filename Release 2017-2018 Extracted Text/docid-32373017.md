Q:

A:

Q:

A:

What was the line of reporting in GiA during the period I served

as working level

point-of-contact with the Warren Commission Staff?

It was a multiple levelechthing "(a) from the Commission and AWD

personally via McCone to Dick Helmss (b) from Helms to the two or

three

components primarity concerned tSE, then SB, Dave Murphy;

LA, then WH; and ably In practice the substantive SB input worked

up by one of its

example search components headed by Lee Wigren--Minsk

, etale passed via cl. cl had own defector input.

In addition, on sensitive natters of concern to the inxestigation,

Dick Helms and Murphy so dealt directly with the Commission.

Did you hear:

? ? Itwo crypts,

one sounded by "Jackenet" ?].

I had not.

Belin recalled that Castro had made a speech in which

he had charged assassination intent by emigres and had promised

retribution in kind if there was official support.

Had any thought been given to the assumption that an anti-Castro

assassination plot might have been underway, and fact it was known

to Helms and to Castro? Mr. Belin said he now knew that Helms

was, in fact, aware of something underway regarding Castro.

had no evidence to show that I (GRy had been informed about it.J

Would that change any of the thinking re Oswald's Mexican trip and

contacts?

Yes, I said, though I intended to

oke potential importanc

to Oswald's KGB contacts, anu relate.

that Land athers--thoug

recognizing the wisdom of the Warter Commission's handling=-had

felt there had been port us the sowet aspect that should have

been

pursued:

a.

Fact that his two Sowet consular contacts in Mexico City

had been identified as KGB and at least one (both 2) had been

traced organtzat tomati

to the T3th lepartment (assassinations).

13th Department.

c. Thinness of file turned over by Soviets in view of b.

1 acknowledged.in retraspect-that-Guban hypathesis was worth recon-

sidering,

though it would appear that neriad at saltainter-serkice

(KGB-UGI) relations began later (i.e. after 1967-68, Venceremos, etc.).

Why did Oswald's lies include a denial to Dallas police that he had

made the Mexican trip unless there was something important to hide

about it? All his other lies concerned key factual elements of his

cover story.

Why also did Marina deny.ishe knew anything about the

Mexican trip in her first story t@' the FBI which she later rectified

before the Warren Commission? Mr Belin noted that he had left the

hypothesis of Castro/Cuban involvement oper'in his book. He added

that it would have been important to have known the facts about the

anti-Castro plot at the timeof the Warren Commission investigation.

He felt the least he would have doneswould have been to have insisted

on the polygraphing of jabina Oswald regarding her knowledge of

Oswald's Mexican trip.

4-

itts.

I. This memorandum.

Sor information and for action,

The proposed lines of action:

Indicated in paragraph 4.

2. AMMUG/1p the Ciban Intelligence Service defector,

has produced information of interest to the President's

commission on the issassination or President Kennedy. Cl

Staff learned of AMMUG/< on 30 April, A questionnaire was

submitted by the Staff on 1 May (Attachment A).

Mr. Swenson,

who is handling the AMMUG/1 debriefing, provided a reply on

5 May (Attachment B). It was clear from Mi. Swenson's

summary that AMMUG/1 had information bearing on the

OSWALD relationship with the Cuban Embassy and Cuban

intelligence personnel in Mexico City, albiet his knowledge

was not that of a direct participant in matters affecting

OSWALD. A follow-up questionaire was submitted to

AMMUG/1 on 6 May (Attachment C). Mr. Swenson's reply

was dated 8 May (Attachment D). Attention is directed

particularly to the content of paragraph two of Attachment D.

3. We have the problem of reconciling the operational

exploitation of AMMUG/1 and satisfying the responsibilities

we have undertaken with Mt. Rancin: AMMUG/1 is such an

operational gold mine that My. Swenson wants, at a maximum,

two months to work fully.: It is palpable, however, that we

must furnish to the Commission the substance of AMMUG/1's

On the previous record of

our association with the Coxmission, particularly with Mr. Rankin,

it seems possible for the fgency to workout an arrangement with

MI. Rankin personally that would take care of their needs and ours

after a frank discusstar

Yof the equities.

4. It is recommended i

that the DDP in person or via a

designee, preferably the former, discuss the AMMUG/1

situation on a very restricted basis with MI. Rankin at his

earliest convenience either at the Agency or at the Commission

headquarter se

Until this takes place, it is not desirable to put

Debrieting of AMMUG-1

: The Oswald Case

: Bllnd Memorandum dated 05 May 1864 V

1. Reference is made to a telephone conversation yesterday

with Chief, CI Staff concerning this matter.

2. Because I am not aware d tha information already

available to the Commission investigating the Cswald Case or

furnished by the Agency, my debriefing of the Source has been

based on the questions prepared by the CI Stalf and on what the

Source answers have suggested. I shall be glad to pursue any

other topics suggested. ox CT Stast

S. The Follos ne Intoration in addition to that in the

reference might be of interest:

a Luisa CALDERON, since she returned to Cuba,

has been paid a regular salary by the DCI even though she has

not performed any services. Her home is in the Vedado section

where the rents are high

b. Source has known CALDETON for several years.

Before going to Mexico, she worked in the Ministry of Exterior

Commerce in the department which was known as the #Empresa

Transimport". Her title was Secretary General of the Communist

Youth in the department named in the previous sentence.

Luisa CALDERON vas transferred directly from her

position in the Ministry o! Exterior Commerce to a post in México,

a matter of surprize to the Source.

d. Rogello RADRIGUEZ Lopez (DGI pseudo MORCOS),

shortly before he left Cuba for Mexico on or about 16 April 1964,

saw CALDERON.

Burd Memorandum dated 07 May 1964

C. Conversations between Cl Stalf and

C/WH/SA/CI

1.

. When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the

specific questions prepared by Cl. Staff were posed. The answers

given by the Source were reported in Reference A. That memorandum

which I dictated to a CI Staff stenographer appears accurate except for

sentence #9 which should have said that the only possible "fabrication"

known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, on a

television program; of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald.

2. On 07 and 08 May 1964 I furtber discussed the Oswald Case •

with the Sourca in order to clarify exactly what he knew and what

he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I believe

that a clearer understanding of what he knows can be reached if I

record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.

Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the

Information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and

comments.

" I have no personal knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD or his

activities and I do not know that OSWALD was an agent of the

Direccion General de Inteligencia (DCI) or any other directorate

or department of the Caban Government.

I first heard of OSWALD after the assassination of President

Kennedy when nowy media carried the name of OSWALD.

Personnel in this Dol first commented about the case, so far as

I can recall, one day after lunch when a group of officers, of

whom I was one, were chatting. The officers present were about

ten including Roberto SANTIESTEBAN, Norberto HERNANDEZ

de Curbelo, Andres ARMONA, Pedro FARINAS Diaz and

Manuel VEGA Perez.

Manuel VEGA Perez previously had

been assigned to Mexico ta the Cuban Consulate where he

was the principal intelligence aftices of the DGI.

VEGA

mentioned that OSWALD had gone to the Cuban Consulate

two or three times in connection with a visa application

during the time that VEGA,w as in Mexico. I gathered,

although I do not know that VEGA made any specific

statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen

OSWALD. I well could have reached this conclusion

because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for

the oGl,

Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons

applying for a visa to go to Cuba. This is because DGI

officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas

of agents of the Dci. Such agents on appearing at the

Consulate use a special phrase to indicate their relationship

with the DGI. (I do not know the particular phrase used

in every case. I do know that agenta from El Salvador in

requesting visas always made mention of the name "Mauricio" )

The Dol oticers at a Consulate interview visa applicants to

lind out it they arcagents. I the visa applicant does not use

one of the indicated phrases. the DGI officers instead of

granting the vise mmediately, tell the applicant to return in

a few days.

The officer then notifies Habana and requests

authority for the visa.

I cannot recall if VEGA even made the

statement that he had requested permission to issue a visa to

OSWALD, but I feel sure that he would have done so because

VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and

this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogello RODRIGU

EZ Lopez also would have

SEEn OSWALD because he worked

with VEGA and also would

have screened visa applicants.

I thought that Luisa CALDERON might have had contact with

OSWALD because I learned about IMarch 1984, shortly before

I made a trip to Mexico, that she had been involved with ar

American in Mexica.,The information to which I refer was told

to me by a DCI case officer named Norberto HERNANDEZ de

Curbelo.

because he gave me $40. OD to duy some shoes and

other items during my trip to Mexico.) I had

commented to HERNANDEZ that it seemed strange

that Luisa CALDERON was recetting a salary from

the DGl although ste apparently did not do any work

for the Service, CHBRNANDEZ told me that bers was

a peculiar case and that hes himself believed that she

had been restraved in vexico by the Central intelligence

Agency althougn anuel PINEIRO, the Head of the DGI,

did not agree. As Krecall, HERNANDEZ had investigated

Luisa CALDERON. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted a letter to

her by an American who signed his name as OWER (phonetic)

or something similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult la Spanish so I am not

sure of how the name mentioned by HERNANDEZ should be

spelled. It could have been "Howard" or something different.

As I understood the matter, the letter from the American

was a love letter. but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and Luisa

CALDERON: Ma saunderstood from HERNANDEZ that

after the interception of the letter she had been followed

and seen in the company of an American. I do not know if

this could have been OSWALD.. I, myself, considered the

case of Luisa CALDERON unusual because I had known her

before she went to Mexico when she worked in the Ministry

of Exterior Commerce in the Empresa Transimport Department

where she was Secretary General of Communist Youth.

She

was transferred directly from that position to a post in Mexico

which seemed strange.

The only other person about whom you asked me in connection

with this, whom I recall, is Sylyia DURAN and I know very

little about her.

What happened was that I was in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico on 23 Mach 1964 about 1230 in the afternoon

preparing to return to Habana the same)day. I was talking to

some other Cubans including Rogelo RODRIGUEZ Lopez and

Ínu BUENAVENTURA of the Cuban Embassy; a courier named

"Enio", a courier named, "Tato" and one other Cuban whom I

cannot recall.

We saw a pratty girl standing at the end a

the reception room, and someone asked who she was, and one

of the group said it was Sylvia DURAN

I recall that, after the news of the assassination of

Presiient Kennedy reached the DGl, orders were issued

for all offigs of the DCI, at Headquatters and in the field,

to sort and package all docainents according to whether

they were "muy gecreto" (very secret), "secreto" (secret),

or 'Importante" (importanty.

The material, once packaged,

was to be held pending further instructions. All travelby

DG] officers and all DGI pouches were suspended temporarily,

In addition, I recall that DGI Headquarters personnel were

instructed either to remain in the DCI Headquarters offices

or to keep the DGI aware of their whereabouts so that they

could be reached immediately. I do not know the reason for

these measures but I belleve it logical that they were issued

because of the possibility that the United State might take

some type of action against Cuba and the DGl offices. As

nearly as I can recall, we were able to unpackage DGI files

and use them normally about the 3rd of December 1963."

In brief, the Source does not claim to have any significant

information concerning the assassination of President Kennedy or

about the activities of OSWALDA Ifthe paraphrased comments of

the Source are considered to nee further charification, I suggest that

Mr. Rocca, who is most fazoiliar with the details of the OSWALD

Case, talk to the Source This can be arranged at any time. Mean-

while, I shall have a question asked in a forthcoming LCFLUTTER to

determine whether or nol the Source seems to have concealed any

information on this matter.

OSH i Case

The source does not have aldest knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD

or his activities but was able to provide items of interest based on

Cuban intelligence officers assigned to the Direccion General De

Inteligencia. The information appearing below was furnished by

the source and is keyed to questions submitted.

1.

Prior to October 1963, OSWALD)visited the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico City on two or three occasions. Before, during and after

these visits, OSWALD was in contact vith the Direccion General De

Inteligencia (DGI), specifiCally with Luisa CALDERON, Manuel

VEGA Perez and Rogekio RODRIGUEZ Dopez.

a Cliban intelligence pseudonym is MARCOS

is the current CubanIS chiefle Mexico. He recently has had a

tour of duty in Habana, prigr to which he held the same post as

now as Cuban IS chief in Mexico.

RODRIGUEZ is a Cüban IS staff officer in Mexico. He has

three. Cuban intelligence pseudonyms, Eduardo, Casimiro and Jose

Antonio..

The precise relationship of Luisa CALDERON to the DGI is

not clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from which she

returned to Cuba early in 1964.

2.

The source does not know whethet or not the Cuban Services

used OSWALD in any agent capacity of other manner.

3.

A.

When news of the assassination of President Kennedy

were "Muy secreto" (very secret), "secreto" (gecret), and

"importante" (important). The material once packaged was to be

held pending further instructions. In addition, all travel by DGI

officers and all DGI pouchesy

were suspended temporarily.

B. When the news that

OSW

ALD was the assassin reached

the DGI, there was no immediate comment but, when Fidel CASTRO

spoke on television to deny Cuban involvement, there was considerable

comment concerning OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

At this time VEGA, who has been mentioned previously, was in Cuba

and commented to a group of DGI staff officers that OSWALD had come

to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to request a visa but had been refused.

VEGA did not give any details and the subject was not pursued.

4. It is not known whether information on OSWALD's visit to

the Cuban Consulate in Mexico In September 1963 was relayed to any

Cuban service.

5. It is nót known if the Cuban intelligence services had contact

with the New Orleans' Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

6. The only Molina who is recalled if "The Hook"', the Cuban who

was convicted in New York City for the murder of a young girl during

a clash between two Cuban groups. The DGI staff officer who had been

in the United Nations in New York, SANTIESTABAN traveled to Cuba

with "The Hook" and with another Cuban named ORIHUELA and upon

arrival in Cuba tried to obtain employment for both individuals. The

names Pedro Charles and Peter have no known significance.

7. The reaction of Soviet officials in contact with the Cuban intelli-

gence services is not known.

8. Nothing is known about Soviet proposals following the news of

President Kennedy's assassination.

9. The only fabrication known is the special matter by Fidel

CASTRO previously mentioned.

10. Nothing is known about Jack RUBENSTEIN aka Jack RUBY.

11, The name Gilberto LOPEZ, is not familiar but, if he visited

DG] headquarters, a photograph of him possibly could be identified.

Dear Mr. Knocke:

As you know, there have been allegations that the CIA was

involved in

a plan to

assassinate Fidel Castro.

For the

purposes of this letter, we will assume that these allegations

are correct, and based upon this assumption I would like to

know the answers to the following questions:

1.

Did anyone with the CIA tell any member of the Warren

Commission or any lawyer serving

on the Warren Commission

staff that such plans had been underway?

If the answer is

yes, we would like to know what person or persons with the

Agency delivered said infornation,

to whom it was delivered,

when it was delivered, what specifically was told or saia,

what documents there are to support the answers to the fore-

going guestions, and what response, if any.-was received from

the Warren Commission. If the Commission was not told about

this, why was it not told and who made the decision not to

deliver such information to the Warren Commission?

2.

There is evidence thad Castro, prior to November 22, 1963,.

knew about the existençwof such plans and the possible

volvement. af the U.S. government.

Did the CIA at any time przor

to the completion of the Warren Commission investigation have

any docunents' of other information indicating that Castro may

have known about such plans?

It the answer is yes, would. you

please foshish)us with copies of all such documents and details

of any such information.

Would you please advise us if there is any information in

foreign government or any foreign group was consider-

ing a possible assassination.of any American leader.. If so,

would you please advise us of all

Prior to his death Lyndon Johnson supposedly stated that

he believed that although there was no doubt: that oswald

killed Kennedy and Tippitt, nevertheless Oswald might have

been a part of a conspiracy in retaliation to possible United

States assassination attempts in Cuba.

Would you please advise

us of any information in Agency files

there was any communication to President Johnson of any possible

plans involving

1MM06/1

DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the

Dire

-to» has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,

Thursday.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a short but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues of

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which. you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WH source. I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the basis for detailed questioning.

The DDP. stated that he would

review this carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing..

3.

Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

been made available on a highly restricted basis to

There have been mossand allegations which began

As DCI, MI. McCope welcomes this appearance before

the Commission to make a categorical and unqualified denial of

responsibilities for what was a dastardly and beinous act. In

witness of this, the DCI submits to the Commission an affidavit

which formalizes this statement.

The affidavit is attached.

action that he desires to draw the Commission's attention to the

fact that the irresponsible charges that have been made, sponsored

Suggestions for Improving Policy and Organization Regarding

Presidential Securil

MI. Rankin raised then Question

dire ctly by letter. In

its response, the Agency confined itself to elements relating

to its statutory mission. Specifically, it was suggested that:

a. The Secret Service, or Treasufy, record

with the Office of Central Referênce a formal require-

ment for information relating to Presidential security.

b. It was suggested that, if the Secret Service

intended to expand its 1

ateltigence coverage of possible

threats to the President's security, our experience

showed that it would need a specialized organizational

component to handle that task within the Secret Service

itself:

c. The CIA reply also noted that the Agency was

in direct touch with the Secret Service regarding the

possible utilization by that agency of our experience in

machine data processing.

On the public record, it is

suggested that the DCI not repeat this detail.

(

In his presentation to the Commission after referring

to these earlier suggestions

the DCI should'state that he desires

to take the opportunity

sestion which he has not

tabled heretofore:

The Commission's major problem has been the assessment

of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to

possible conspiratorial guidance. Because conspiracy is the

core of the problem, the DCI should point out the possibility of

legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing

recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating. There

is an analogy at close band between the problem of developing in

advance information relating to Presidential security and the

problem faced by the countay a few years ago regarding the

clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U.S. of special

nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that

time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955

(29 Stat 365, PL.165, 84th Congress). In essence, the Act estab-

lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

the Act provided by any person, and in certain instances privileged

treatment for such persons -- for example, asylum if they were

created to adminter the purposes of the Act.

1) The bet should all seitar the Commission consider a

recommendation for original legislative action designed to

induce individuals to furnish information bearing on Presidential

security by offering a substantial reward and preferential treatment.

The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

which would attend the implementing legislation in this matter

could represent a significant inducement even to staff officers

and personnel of secret associations and state security organs

abroad whose functions include assassination and sabotage. It

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action.

The reward would constitute additional inducement for such

individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

The suggestion does not restion the material elements of

reward and special treatment. The DCI can assure the Com-

mission that we are aware that personnel in police state apparatuses

charged with the assassination and sabotage functions bave repeatedly

expressed and, in many cases, acted upon their repugnance for

There are specifio cases in the past teniyears which document

In making this suggestion, the DCI may go one step further

in advising the Commission to suggest that the Commission

examine the advisability of legislation making it a Federal offense

to conspire and to kill the Chief Executive. 3) The DCI could also

indicate that the Commission might desire to suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

spiracy to kill any Federal official in the President's personal

circle of official associates directly concerned with national

security affairs. (The Agency's Legal Counsel states that

draft bills have been considered on the Hill.) .

Mexican and Cuban Phases of Oswald's Activity

Extensive information aubeen made available to the

Commission by CLA on the working level regarding Osvala'a

activity in Mexico City in September and October 1963. The

Commission Staff has been in detailed communication and

conversation with the Agency working levels both in head.

quarters and in Mexico City. Within the past week,

significant information has been developed by CLA regarding

the relationship with Oswald of certain, Cuban intelligence

personnel in Mexico City and the reaction in Havana within

the Cuban Intelligence Service to the news of the assassination

of President Kemedy. The Commission Staff is in the course

of being briefed en the Cuban aspect.

It is suggested that the DCI handle any question on the

Mexican and Cuban phases of Oswald's acfi

vity as "technical

questions" which members of the Commiselon can develop

from or through their own staff with the appropriate component

of the Agency. This w

be entirely

consistent with the DCI's

overall assurance that he has BAl

ructed his personnel to place

their information completely at the Commission's disposition.

Review of Selected Items in the

The attached tatgew

the espress request of Mr.

David W. Belin as a follow-

15 April 1975.

The results - as I have already told him - add

These can be made available promptly, however,

on request.

This sunmary does not deal with press,

REFERENCE

•Letter by David m. Belin to

15 April 1975,

paragraph 3

(Regarding Public Statement

by CASTRO,

=, attached

BACKGROUND

I. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent;

Daniel HARKER.

2.. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO'S

statements' to HARKER covered

a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular Président KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordinazily

rovocative fashion

" ... KENNEDY is acretitE

... the BATISTA of his

times... the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of september 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning papers the Times-Picayune,

on Monday, 2 September, page 7, under a three-column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels.". The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba."

This has happened to promises made during the

be seen with new attacks.

"'But I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...'

6.

The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire

service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

following up leads of in dealings with the Warren Connission

Headquarters attention to the Ar stary xery shostly after

the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at MI. Belin's

request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

fron testimony of Marina OSWAlD and others'- he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

Caban diplomatic officials in

to be 'one of his lies, but later

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected by the

language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down or developed by investigation.

Thus,

the record of the beginning of OSWALD's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a question mark.

11. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban

relations after CASTRO's takeover.. OSWALD, and DELGADO at

the outset, were CASTRO supporters, OSWALD being particu-

larly keen about how to get to the island. DELGADO testi-

INTERCEPTED. CONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE,

LUISA CALDERON, APTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

18.

At 1)g Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"uisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had herd the latest

news. "Tuisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of course, I knew

it almost before KENNEDY

... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians!

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination. "Luisa" also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating

the death of KENNEDY, nor would

they have the party condide with the burial. Finally she

said she planned to move that night into the house of a

doctor (a woman Friend.

21. Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto suggestion

of foreknowledge? This is the only item in the intercept

coverage of the Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknowledge or expectation.

to be working in DGI Headquarters.

The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

•as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963) The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'S SUCCESSOI)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

there remains the more

fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

28.

The ALVARaDa story is a particularly acute repre-

sentat

om of the

iNdiéficulties that beset the evaluation of

observed evidence: certain elements of the story persist

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,

whose account did not become public until the release of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate tran

saction of a Negro

kiculate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

frow a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN. the husband of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

glena GARRO's trenchant anti-Communism.

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy Officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and‹in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

three Gringos stood out she took a good look

assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was

her daughter immediately said that he was one

afternoon of 11 January 1964.

ur. Angleton said that fr. mife,

apparently pro-

rosed by press accusations that the

Wanger Cormission has

been ailatory, asted clA for suggestions aquestións or

requests

to be included in a letter to the vort lovement.

This Tetzer,

LIon the Tarren Comission anavo be transmittea

through the

Departnent of State,

would seek additional evi-

dence which

1s presunably avallablo in Soviet files wilch

could

assist the Connission's deliberations. Nr. Dulles did

not have a detailed idea of what he ranted to ask the Soviets

fos but did say that the questions should be "not too tech-

nical.

Although it. Angleton thought that the letter shoald

be written only alter the CIA report and couments have been

complated, in order to nake the lotter as effective as possi-

ble, Mr. Dulles felt it should go now,

be phrased In generall-

ties and alloy the Soutets nore flexibility in their handling

of the natter than would a nore pointed letter based on our

concrete findings.

#r. Dulles asked CIA only for the questions

and not for a dralt letter.

Mr. Jurphy suggested that we asit

only for certain records rather

to

than put spacific questions

the Soviets:

115. Murphy suggested that these night include

soviet hospital records connocted with lee Oswald's attenstad

suicide, city visa and registration records for doscoy and

Mins', factory personnel records Iron Oswald's place of employ-

Bent,

etc. AIso Oswald's diary noted

that bis case had passed

through two

connissions in the

USS?; va might ask for tha

records of these coumissions as vell.

felt necessary to esplain to Mr.. Dulles the direction of our

thinking about thesa proposals.

(Hote: I Instructed dr. Higren to prepare a

drait of suggested queries, using the

assIstance of DERYABIN and to have this

ready, 1i possible, by the closa of

businesg today.

Rankin stated that the Connission wants to account

tine outside the United States. Mr. Bagley suggested that.

be convarted to a chronology tabulation which would pernit us

more staplyito insert added details and dates as we learned

of then la other documentation which we can expect to receive

shortly.

(Note:

I instructed ir. Wigren to begin re:

casting the narrative immediately Into

this form.)

Mr. Rankin sald that the Comission has & waist high

stack of documents and rsports recalred from the FBI and Secret

Service which CIA has not yet recelved.

These Include Secret

Service interviews with Narina Ossaid,

letters Iron Lee Oswald

In the USSB and other naterial..

He promised to send this

material to Mr. Helms shortly.

Hoto:

He will pass appropriate parts of this

material to DERYABIN for further analy-

sis along the linas of his earlier work

on documents already in our possession.)

BIN'S, initial

questions towhich it gave sise,

Important contrebution.

CIA would be unable to hate any seri-

analysigor even hypothesis until some of dallabin's

questions lad been answered. Mr. Rocca suggested that DERKA-

paper be recast into more of a questionnalre form and.

AT. Bagley agreed, pointing out that DERYABIN's comment and

speculation could be put off to the side as explanatory com

ment on esch questios,

as appropriate.

MT. Angleton and Mr:

Hurphy thought that it would be desirable to send this paper

to the Harren Commission in advance of other CIA reports with

a menorandan Infornisg the Connission that ne nould need

answers to this interim questionnalre in order to reconstruct

a detatled chronology of Oswald's time in the USSh and to

comment on his activity there.

The Connission would be asked

to procure the information from Marina through any Agency 1t

might choose.

of defectors to analysing the Oswald papers:

The persons present said that the

Commission would.

If a defector who had contributed to the analy

sis of the documents should be unwilling to appear person-

ally and formally before the Cormission, would the

Connission exercise its subpoena powers against him?

Hit. Rankin thought that if there was

& risk involved for the defector, the

Commission would not do so.

However,

Ransin promised to get a fornal answer

-One matter which had been brought to light by the

Osvald case was the need for a nechanish in the United States

Government to record'and assimilate our knowledge of the Sovlet

The Bureau is

apparently in sone danger of criticisn for its latlure to keep

Similarly CIA has not

systenatically collected nor compiled information on Sovtel

Berlin Base had kept a list of American
