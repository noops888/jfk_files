that "American gangsters" infiltrated and partially con-

trolled the Bahamas Government. He also made a trip to

London, England, and reportedly conferred with the

Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs

and demanded a

probe by a Royal Commission of Bahamas gambling.

In an article in the "Miami Herald", 1/23/67,

"Herald" Staff Writer JAMES BUCHANAN reported that the

Premier "told the "Herald' this week" that "my Government

is concerned about the influx of undesirable elements in

the gambling picture"

In the article BUCHANAN reported that the

Premier will carry out his campaign promise to rid the

Bahamas of the conflict of interest in Government and

clean up gambling operations. He reported that the current

yearly income from two gambling casinos amounts to $77,000,000.

Each of the two casinos he reported pays $280,000 yearly

taxes.

NIGEL MORRIS, Commissioner, Bahamas Police Force,

Nassau, on 1/18/67, advised

that it is probable that the

PLP Premier. PINDLING will make a major issue out of the

alleged gangster influx in the Bahamas gambling casinos.

He said that it is probable that MAX COURTNEY and FRANK

RITTER,

former managers of the Monte Carlo

Casino, and CHARLES BRUDNER, former Casino Supervisor,

will be asked to leave the Bahamas.

He pointed out that

the previous Government was responsible for the three

individuals being released from the casino operations. but

had agreed to permit these men to remain in the Bahamas

as tourists on a temporary basis. Commissioner MORRIS

advised that he has received information that MICHAEL

MC LANEY may receive a gambling license from

the Premier
