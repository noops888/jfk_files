Purpose and Scope of Study

The Central Intelligence Agency's performance

in its role of support to the Warren Commission

has been a source of controversy since the

relevant to

the assassination of President Kennedy.

During 1976 the critic's

assertions were the subject of official inguiry

by the Senate Select

Committee to Study

Governmental Operations (hereinafter SSC). The

SSC, in its report regarding "The Investigation

of the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy:

I: Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select

committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for

Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the

investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as

follows:

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question.. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense

of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

recollection, were we ever asked to.

On November 23, 1963 Helms called a meeting of senior-

level CIA officials to outline the Agency's investiga-

Mr. Rocca. That was certainly the one that i would

say dominated - looking at it from my point of view.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-

Castro assassination plots on the part of the CIA, would

you have given more priority, more emphasis, to the

possibility of a Castro conspiracy to kill the President?

Seott's area of proficiency. So the defectors had only

out and they came out later, the Cuban

defectors.

So, I can't -- I really can't say that (a) the

Cuban connection was ignored, because it wasn't.: The

press was filled with it at the time.

The Harker interview should have been undoubtally

given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it

was given specific attention, I was told at the time of

the Rockefeller thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. In what way was the Cuban connection

investigated?

Mr. Rocca. I don't know.

I don't know this.

A. Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of

the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of

the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-

generated information to the Warren Commission.

The

general consensus of these representatives is that the

Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful

working relationship during the course of the Commission's

investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,

p. 18)

(See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,

8/9/78, p. 24.) William Coleman, a senior staff counsel

for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent.

(See HSCA staff interview of William Coleman,

8/2/78.) Mr. Slawson expressed a similar opinion

regarding the Agency's cooperation and quality

(Ibid. p. 24.) Mr. Rocca concluded that on this basis:

"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information

bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

to the Warren Commission.": (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the warren Commission was

propounded by Richard, Helms.

Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the

CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination and the

establishmen of CiA policy visa ris he Warren Commission.

(Ibid., p. 23.) He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, P. 10.) MI. Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inguiry would come over (from the Warren Com-

mission) We would attempt to respond to it.

But these inquiries came in individual bits and

pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we

could:

(Ibid., p. 34.)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

Commission requests on a case basis rather than uniformly

volunteering relevant information to the Warren Commission

stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's perception

of the CIA's investigative responsibility. Mr. Rankin was

asked by Committee Counsel whether he worked under the

impression that the Agency's responsibility was simply to

respond to questions that were addressed to CIA by the

Warren Commission. In response, Mr. Rankin testified as

follows:

How was I to know that? And besides.

Mr. Helms further indicated that the CIA might

be called upon to provide additional information

acquired from checks of CIA records and agency

sources.

He suggested that certain policies be

employed to enable CIA to work cooperatively

with the Commission in a manner which would

protect CIA information, sources and methoas.

Among the policies articulated were two which

Helms claimed would enable the Agency to control

the flow of Agency originated information.

In

this way the CIA could check the possibility of

revealing its sources and methods inadvertantly•

The CIA's unwillingness to inform the Warren

Warren Commission Knowledge cE CIA Telephonic Surveillance

During the period of March - April 1964,

David Slawson drafted a series of memoranda which

among other issues concerned Warren Commission know-

to support the Committee's belief that the Warren

that date, Coleman, Slawson and Willens met with

Win Scott, the CIA's Chief of Station in Mexico

City, who provided them with various transcripts

and translations derived from CIA telephone taps

of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy/Consulates. (Slawson

Memorandum of April 22, 1964, Subject: Trip to

Mexico City P 22)

Prior to April 9, it appears doubtful that

the Commission had been given even partial access

to the referenced material. Nevertheless, by March

12, 1964, the record indicates that the Warren

Connission had at least become aware that the CIA

did maintain telephonic surveillance of the Cuban

Embassy/Consulate. (Slawson memorandum, March 12,

1964, Subj: meeting with CIA representatives).

Slawson's memorandum of March 12 reveals that. the Warren

Commission had learned that the CIA possessed tran-

scripts of conversations between the Cuban Ambassador

to Mexico, Armas, and the Cuban President Dorticos. The

These comments indicate that Slawson placed

qualified

reliance upon the Mexican police summary.

Moreover, there is no indication that Slawson had

been provided the Duran telephonic intercept tran-

scripts. In fact, by virtue of Slawson's comments

concerning the Mexican police report, it would

appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information

pertaining to Silvia Duran.

As Slawson reveals,

the Commission had been forced to rely upon the two

memoranda that did not make reference to the surveil-

the Mexican Federal Police.

The Committee's belief that Slawson had

not been given access to the Duran transcripts:

further supported by reference to his memorandum

of March 27, 1964 (CD 692) wherein he states his

conclusion that Oswald had visited the Cuban

Embassy on three occasions. (Ibid, P. 2) This

conclusion,.he

again

wrote, was based upon an analysis of

Silvia Duran's testimony before the Mexican police.

This memorandum bears no indication that he had

reviewed any of the Duran transcripts. Furthermore,

had Slawson been given access to these transcripts,

certainly their substance would have been incorporated

into his analysis and accordingly noted for this

purpose. His analysis would have reflected the fact

of his review either by its corroboration or

criticism of the above cited Mexican police summary report.

Logically, access to the CIA's telephonic

surveillance production would have clarified some

ambiguities. For example, on September 27, at 4:05 p.i.

outlined Angleton's desire not to respond directly

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President

Kennedy's assassination a Cuban government employee

in Mexico City named "Luisa" received a telephone

call from an unidentified man speaking Spanish.

( CIA DOC. FOI

This call had been intercepted and recorded by the

CIA's Mexico City-Station as the result of its

LIENVOY (tel. tap) operation. ](Ibia.) The Mexico

City Station as subsequently reported to CIA

headquarters, identified the Luisa of the conversa-

tion as Luisa Calderon, who was then employed in

the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban Consu-

late. (Ibid.)

During the course of the conversation, the

unidentified caller asked Luisa if she had heard

(of the assassination)

the latest news. Luisa replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Rennedy-".

fied caller replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller

that she had learned nothing else about the assassina-

tion and

that she had learned about the assassination

only a little while ago.

The unidentified caller

commented:

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic

do not merit serious attention. Her words

may indeed indicate foreknowledge of the assassina-

sinister implication. Nevertheless, the Committee

has determined that Luisa Calderon's case should

have merited serious attention in the months following

the assassination.

In connection with the assassination, Luisa

Calderon's name first surfaced on November 27, 1964

in a cable sent by then Ambassador Mann to the State

Department (CIA Doc. DIR 85573, 11/27/63) •

In that cable Mann stated:

...Washington should urgently consider

feasibility of requesting Mexican authorities

to arrest for interrogation: Eusebio Azcue,

Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal.

The two

men are Cuban national and Cuban consular

officers. Luisa Calderon is a secretary

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments

could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible

foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,

Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

thel Agency's )Cuban and Soviet (telephone

intercepts that might suggest foreknowledge

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi

dent. This involves a faulty translation of an

answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer

to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."

The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere

(the first person of the verb enterarsede,

past tense)

should be translated as"

almost before Kennedy /did7." In other words,

calderon was saying she heard about the shooting

of Kennedy almost at the time the event took

place..."

(CIA DoC., Memorandun Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency.

It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderoms

comments as a suggestion on her part of possible ®

foreknowledge of President Kennedy's assassination.

However, the CIA's copy of this

According to CIA files, Calderon made

reservations to return to Havana on Cubana Airlines on

December 11, 1963, less than four weeks after the

assassination. (CIA Doc. CSCI-316/01783-65, 4/26/63)

If so, please indicate when and

The CIA responded by memorandum:

"Although the (Mexico City) Station considered

the conversation of sufficient possible

interest to send a copy to headquarters,

the latter apparently did nothing with

it, for there appears to be no record in the

Oswald file of such action as may have

conclusion that the Warren Commission was never

which it could evaluate Luisa Calderon's

A September 1, 1963 CIA dispatch from the Chief

in Reynosa, Texas, married to an American

of Mexican descent. If (CIA asset) can

When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-l's defection

and considered the possibility that he

might have some knowledge of

the Oswald

case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions

(Western Hemisphere) for debriefing

AMMUG-1...WH desk records reflect that

on the Oswald case was handled as a sensitive

matter, it was dictated directly to a CI

(Counterintelligence) stenographer. on

5 May 1964.

Note: A-I was debriefed on

several subjects on 4 May 64.

The procedure

was to assign each subject discussed a

debriefing number and they were written

up in contact report form by the WH case

officer.

The instructions from CI staff

were to handle the Oswald case debriefing

very closely and not to keep any copies in

WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was

logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing

report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly

to a CI staff stenographer. There would

be no reason to include the number 40 on

the report of this special debriefing for

CI staff, since it was their only debriefing

report.

We are certain it is the debriefing

report (#40) because the date is the same:

it is the only debriefing report on Oswald

listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)

the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in

operation (CIA. Inspector General Report 1967

pp. 1-74; 78-112). The AMIASE operation involved

a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA

cryptonym AMIASH/1) who, during 1962 while meeting

with a CIA representative expressed the desire to

assassinate Fidel Castro (Ibid., P. 84). As a

result of AMLASH's expressed objective and the

CIA's desire to find a viable political alternative

to the Castro regime, the Agency subsequently

provided AMLASH with both moral and material

support designed to depose Fidel Castro. (Ibid.,

PP• 80-94) The AMLASH operation was terminated

by the CIA in 1965 as the result of security leaks.

(Ibid. pp. 104-106) During 1965, AMLASH and his

conspirators were brought to trial in Cuba for plotting

against Castro.

AMLASH was sentenced to death, but

at Castro's request the sentence was reduced to

twenty-five years imprisonment. (Ibid. pp. 107-110).

In its examination of the AMLASH operation

to erroneous criticisms made today:

The Agency should have taken broader

initiatives then as well.

CIA employees at the time felt-as

they obviously did--that the activities

about which they knew had no relevance

not take the place of a record of

Richard Helms, as the highest level CIA

employee in contact with the Warren Commission on

a regular basis, testified to the Rockefeller

Commission that he did not believe the AMLASH

operation was relevant to the investigation of

President Kennedy's death. (Rockefeller Commission,

Testimony of Richard Helms, 4/24/75 pp. 389-391,392)

In addition, Mr. Helms testified before this

Committee that the AMLASH operation was not designed

to be an assassination plot (Exec. Sess. Test. of

Richard Helms, 8/9/78, pP. 26-27).

A contrasting view to the testimony of Mr.

Helms was offered by Joseph Langosch who in 1963

was the Chief of Counterintelligence for the CIA's Special>

Special Affairs Staff was the CIA component

Sept. 14, 1978, P. 1) The Special Affairs Staff

was headed by Desmond FitzGerald and was responsible

for the AMIASH operation (SSC, Book V, pP. 3, 8, 79)

Langosch, as the Chief of Counterintelligence

for the Special Affairs Staff, was responsible for

safeguarding SAS against penetration by foreign

intelligence services, particularly the Cuban

Intelligence Services (HSCA Classified Affidavit

of Joseph Langosch, 9/14/78, p. 3). It was

Langosch's recollection that:

the AMLASH operation prior to the

assassination of President Rennedy was

characterized by the Special Affairs

staff, Desmond Fitzgerald (sic) and other

senior CIA officers as an assassination

operation initiated and sponsored by the

CIA.

(Ibid., p. 4)

Langosch further recollected that as of 1962

it was highly possible that the Cuban Intelligence

Services were aware of AMLASH and his association

with the CIA and that the information upon which

he based his conclusion that the AMLASH

operation was insecure was available to seep dered crA

officials, including Desmond FitzGerald.

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this

Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit

executed by Kent I. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who "served

as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the

entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs

Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it

progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent I. Pollock,

executed

Oct. 5, 1978, P. 1) Mr. Pollock specifically

contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation

was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond

FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an

assassination operation.

In pertinent part, Pollock

drew the following conclusions:

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald

considered the AMLASH operation

to be a political

action activity with the objective of organizing

a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the

Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat.

I heard

Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation

frequently, and never heard him characterize it as

an "assassiantion operation." Mr. FitzGerald

stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves

loss of life.

(Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH

operation as an

"assassigntion operation"; the

case officer did not; I, as Executive Officer, never

discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with

Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other

branch chiefs and the special assistants could not

have so characterized it since they did not know

about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a

hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH

for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.)

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day

of President Kennedy's death.

AMLASH rejected the

pen with disdain. LIbid., par. 4, P. 27), (Ibid.,

par. 6, p. 3)

not simply meet one or it or sta

assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's

death.

The broader and more significant issue,

as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether

the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy

to have been reported to the Warren Commission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation this

determination is a most difficult matter to

resolve.

Reasonable men may differ in their

characterization of the Agency's operational

objectives.

Based upon

the presently available evidence

it is the Coumittee's position that such informa-

tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,

might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-

tive concern for possible Cuban involvement or

complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin

commented before this Committee:

-when I read...the Church Committee's

report--it was

an ideal situation for

them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story and fit it

in with the facts that had to be met

and then either blame the rest of it

on somebody else or not tell any more

or polish it off.

I don't think that

could have happened back in 1964.

I think there would have been a

much better chance of getting to

the heart of it.

It might have

only revealed that we are involved

in it and who approved it and all

that. But I think that would

have at least come out.

(HSCA Class.

Depo. Of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

The Committee is in agreement with Mr. Rankin

that had the AMLASH operation been disclosed to

the Warren Commission, the Commission might have

been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture

that has surrounded the AMLASH operation during

the past decade. As history now records, the AMLASH

operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba and the United States.
