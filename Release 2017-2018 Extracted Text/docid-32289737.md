/JFK Law 11(a)

It is noted

that as set out in previous reports

on ALEX, all of this information regarding the source of

C. Marital Status

CG T-3, who has furnished reliable information

in the past, advised that as incongruous

as it may

seem,

the marriage relationship which exists between GUS ALEX

based on love

and respect. He said that years ago he

believes

that their marriage was on rocky ground. and that

recently MARIANNE seems most devoted to AIEX. He stated

that he does not believe that MARIANNE RYAN would consider

Swiss francs ($100,000

information from the local police at St. Moritz. He stated

the local police consider that the individual visiting in

Moritz was in fact identical with the subject of this case.

An inquiry was conducted by this office to determine

whether or not ALEX was in Chicago on the date of the robbery,

March 4, 1959. This investigation will not be set out in detail

in this report since it has been made the subject of a separate

six-page memorandum,

but it is noted that ALEX's exact where-

abouts during the first week of March are not known. However,

the payroll checks of the business firms owned by EDDY? VOGEL,

negotiated by ALEX sometime prior to March 13, 1959.

these checks were dated

on February 27, 1959, and on March 6,

1959, this would indicate that ALEX was in town between Febru-.

ary 27, 1959, and March 13, 1959, and between March 6, 1959,

and March 13, 1959.
