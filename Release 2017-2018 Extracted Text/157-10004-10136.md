TOP STRET

450-4

At this point Harvey reviewed the rest of the file

memos I had brought,

with regard to the accounting against

QJWIN/L

for some

of the activities he engaged in with

Roselli, he suggested that he always thought of

as

the overarching crypt within which were the QJWIN operation

and the

exploration of executive action

He said that he used QJWIN/

sometimes in connection

with the

Roselli activities, but only after there had been

some initial mixup by the finance section which resulted in

his general

activities and QJWIN operation being

slugged the same combined crypt of QJWIN/l

With

regard to a note that refened tof henry, Manfreddi,

llarvey

did not know why his name was on notes in the QJWIN

file, except that he was a highly talented narcotics expert

who worked both in the Justice Department and the CIA and

who might have been involved in the evaluating of or check-

ing on potential assets whom QJWIN had spotted in Italy.

(The file does reveal that QJWIN spotted assets in Italy.)

With regard to the small note in the file that simply

says "John Ralston - John Roselli -- William Walker."

CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO

DECLASSIFICATION AND/OR
