It van largoly devoted to a review of Sab

Ject's military ranks and awards, but inevitably a number

of related topics were touched upon.

Subject was also

quentloned about bis father's funeral, and about members

of the presidiun and the Sovlet Governont generally.

Subjoct one first asked whos and where ho first

entered on active milltary service.

He received his first voyemarr

ments and procedure"s subject had ever been a mayal offs-

cor anywhore (or for that mattor an officer in any branch

of service) he conld essily have invented satislactory

anvers to my elesentary questions instead he appeared to

be

leprovlaing answers on the basis of very inadequate

knowledge.

4. Bubjoct gave the following chronology of bia

military ranks:

July 1947 - Jr. Lt. of the Beserve

October 1950 - Jr. Lt.

Apr11 1951 (while 1n Far Bast) - It.

April 1953 (1n HVD) - Sr. Lt.

October 1959 (ICE) - Capt.

October-Hovember 1963 (KGB) - It. Colonel

In no intance does he remember who signed the order of his

pronotion to a nor military rank (normally, one vould

remember at least a few).

I told Subject that 1t una m

posalble for him to have been promoted is the MYD in April

1953, or at any tiae in March-June and even later In 1953-

because not one single person in the MVD was promoted at

this time.

He looked astounded and at Irst seemed unde-

cided wbat line to take, but finally said that he couldn't

may about anyone else, but he was sure that he received

his promotion at that time.

(In fact, this 1s excluded.

A11 promotions vere held up fron Beria until late 1953.)

B.

Bubject said that be was pat up lor captain in

1956, but that the promotion was blocked by LYALIl--who

was deputy chairman at that time and a member of the pro

motion board-on the grounde that Subject should be unde

to wnlt because of shortcomings in his vork.

Subject

said that be was proposed for major in 1959, but only re-

celved captain.

At that time, be was promised by GRIBAlOV

that he vould be promoted directly to Lt. Colonel the

and pointed out to hin that not even

tho.astropaut. GAGAEIM.had.been.ablo.to.sklp a rant.. Sub

Ject simply inslated that this is what had bappened. He

suld that he didn't know why he should have gotten such

spocial treateent, and could only suppose that allowance

vas nade for his

long stretch as & 8r. Lt. and the fact

that ho vas a doputy chief of department.

(Subject's

stor does not hold vater no matter bor you turn it; even

11 hle career had proceeded normally he would not have

been eligible for It. Col, before 1964.) Asked why he had

previously told un that he had been a rajor (in the auto

blography prepared in Frankfurt), Subject said he did not

think ve would believe the true story.

Subject was then questioned briefly on the famou

incident.

His story about the investigation of this

Incident does not conform to normal practice in such cases,

and 1s not believable.

Still worse is bla account of the

consequences this lncident had on his Konsorol standing.

Be maintains that the vzyokantya (punishment) was removed

from his rocord in October 1954, Just a few months after

the Incident.

This 1s never done In less than a year,..

especlally for such a surious offense.

His explanation:

that this was done to enable him to leave the Komonol be

cause of age without a black mart on his record is siaply

abaurd:

for a IGB officer to leave the Komsonol because

of age and without entering the. Party 1s a black mark in

itself, and would knevitably nean expulsion from the KGB.

Bubject was completely unable to describe the procedure

Involved In turning in his Konsonol card.

Fe admitted

that he was the only member of the SCD who was not elther

In the Konsonol or the Party, but maintained that no one

had over even talked to him about 1t.

Subject snid he received the following medals

and awards:

Medal for Victory over Cermany - 1945-46

Medal for Defense of Moscow - 1915-46

Medal 40 Years Soviet Army - 1957

Medal 3rd Class, for Honorable Service,

Subject first sald be received it 1n March 1969,

then corrected himself and said 1962. ' Asked why not 'in

1960. (1t takes into account both military and KGB service).

Bubject said he didn't know why 1t ins go late, that 1t

was personnel's fault, possibly because of the reorganiza-

tion of the SCD.

Those are nonsonsical answers, and 1t

is obvions that Subjoct is unsure about when he should bave

received this nodal, renembers the previous interrogation,

and 1s being careful.

Asked what he recolved the Order of the Red Star for,

Subjoct was entremely evasive.

Fe. claimed not. to remember

the exact formlation of the order, and perhaps slippod

when he snid "For excoptional performanco of alssion."

When I asked his what nisaion, he said that it was just 10r

cood work in general.

Bubject also snid that in 1959 he was put in for the

Order of the Rod Banner because of his tourlet recrultants,

but did not get it, probably because he was transferred to

the first Dopartnent at the time.

Reminded about his pre-

vous boasts about the Order. of Lesin, be said that 1t. was

promised to him in 1963 but he did not receive it. Sub

Ject did not say what It would have been for.

8. I asked Subject 1f be had attended the opening of

the Deerzhinskly Menorial in front of the KGB bullding.

Bubjoct quickly said that be wan't there and that be

didn't remember when it was opened or where be ras at the

time. He refused to estinate rhether this took place

ander BERIYA, KRUCIOY, SIROV, SEBLEPIN, OF SENICHASTITY,

and looked unconfortable when reminded that it was a very

big event, attended by DZERZHINSKIY'® "ife and son, among

othere.

(It was opened on 20 December 1958--the 4let

birtbday of Soviet State Security-and was attended by

KKRUSICHXV and all other presidium members.)

9.

Bubject was asked to describe his father's funeral.

mas he did in a satistactory manner.

Asked shere be had

come from to attend this funeral,

subject replied that be

was in Moscow all the time of his father's illness from:

May 1956 until his denth in August 1956 with the exception

of a few days TDY in Klev (this would be for the BURGI

case, about which Subject will be questioned next time).

Of possible Interest 1a Subject's remark, appropos of noth-
