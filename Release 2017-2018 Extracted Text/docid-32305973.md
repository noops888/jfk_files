Also enclosed is a photocopy of the notes which

were in the possession of SALVATORE TORNABE on 11/14/57.

This was received on 3/10/58, by the NYO from the Bureau.

Regarding the Lexington Hotel records, a review

of the files of the NYo reflects that no original record

Of JAMES LADUCA's stay at that hotel is in the possessior

of the NYO.

It is noted that on 3/7/58, the NYS Liquor

Authority had in its possession Lexington Hotel records

regarding LADUCA's stay there from 11/7/57, to 11/12/57.

A review of NYO files failed to reflect possession

by the NYO of any registration cards lised in enclosure to

reBulet for the New Yorker Hotel. It is noted that on

1/17/58, EDWARD FORD, Assistant Credit Manager of the hotel,

furnished information regarding the stay of FRANK DESIMONE

and SIMONE SCOZZARI from 11/11/57, to 11/15/57, to SA JAMES

M. BEARDSLEY from these records.

NYO files further reflected that no registration

cards from the Forrest Hotel as set forth in above mentioned

On 3/25/50,

telephone operator at the Forrest

and ANTHONY GUARNIERI were at the hotel the weekend of

3/17/58.

On 1/27/58, Miss V. DUNN, Auditor, advised SA JAMES

P. MANSFIELD that the only record she could

I locate

regarding GUARNIERI was a registration for 12/27/57. She

stated that her records had been borrowed by a team of men

from the Mc Clellan Committee who had visited her office a

week earlier and secured information pertaining to persons

recently identified with the Apalachin meeting.

On 1/22/58, JOSEPH ROONEY, Manager, stated he could

locate no record for

ANGELO SCIANDRA and DOMINIC ALAIMO had been in the hotel in

the past.
