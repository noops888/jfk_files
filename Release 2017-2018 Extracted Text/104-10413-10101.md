President's Commission by the Central

On Monday, 8 May 1972, MT. Arthur Dooley visited

Congressman Richard Ichord

to show him

the exhibits he

requested

answer any questions.

Mr. Ichord

Chairman of

the House Committee

Internal Security.

It was quickly apparent that he knew very little about

the Oswald case, and that he had been misled by Bernard

Fenstervald, Jr. regarding the extent of CIA's coverage

of Oswald when he was in Mexico City. Mr. Ichord ex-

amined the documents and raised a number of points

which were answered candidly and without reservation.

He thanked us for easing his mind and said that we could

consider the matter closed. Mr. Ichord was well-disposed

from the onset and assured us that

shown to him would be held in strict

confidence. A more detailed memorandum is attached.

SUBJECT: Lee Harvey Oswald Caselfriefing of Congressman

Richard Ichord, & May

Mr. Joseph O'Neill, Office of the Legislative

Counsel, presented Mr. Arthesteeley, who furnished the

requested by the Congressman, and answered his

Nr. Ichord said he was concerned over

of the Oswald Investigation from

the standpoint of his

committee.

He wanted to know if "during CIA's investigation

of Oswald when he was in Mexico'! we developed any evidence

of a conspiratorial relationship between the Soviets and

Oswaldeither through our coverage of the Embassy or

outside meetings.

He specifically referred to Soviet

consular officials Pavel Antonovich Yatskov. and Valeriy

Vladimirovich Kostikov,

or both of whom Oswald

contacted

at the soviet Embassy. (Both ratskov and nostikov

vere identified in the Commission's Report as consular

officials and KGB representatives.) I told him that CIA

did not have Oswald

under investigation when he was in

Mexico City; directed his attention to the pertinent

exhibit; and explained that the KGB affiliations of the

two Soviets were supplied by CIA experts who were

of their activities

and not by

anything said or

indicated

by Oswald in

evidence

compiled by

us. Mr. Ichord

examined the exhibit,

noted that Oswald's short conversations

only related to securing visas;

indicated that he had been

misinformed; and said that he had no further questions to

3. He said that his question was sparked by Bernard

rensterwald,

JI, a former constituent, about whom he

knew very little when he requested the documents. Since

then he has learned of Fensterwald's dubious credentials

as an expert on the assassination and of his association

with Jim Garrisson and others of questionable repute.

I detailed our own difficulties with

Fensterwald, his

Executive Director

insistence that we are hiding somethin&investigate

and how,

of the Committee to

Assassinations, he has been pressing us to release our

classified documents under threat of invoking the

Freedom of Information Act.

that we have not

released exhibits relating to Oswald's visits to the Soviet

information are extremely sensitive and still productive.

Mr. Ichord fully agreed

on this

score and complimented us

the extent of our coverage.

I pointed out that most of our material consists of "nut

I. I mentioned in passing, that two other things

our control have contributed to the misconceptions

over our exhibits: A)The inadvertent release by National

Archives of the master list of numbered exhibits shortly

after the demise of the President's Commission without

distinguishing between overt and classified items; and

B). the

fact that many exhibits bear different numbers

there are more exhibits than is the case. The release

of the master list without the accompanying documents

until we declassified the document a couple of years ago.

8. Mr.. Ichord asked if any CIA members served on

the President's Commission. I said no,

but mentioned that

former DCI Allen Dulles was on the Commission. He then

turned to the makeup

of the Commission staff

and how

was chosen. I replied that we were not really competent

to comment on how it was chosen but the staff consisted

largely of attorneys of varied political and ethnical

backgrounds from widely separated parts of the country;

that,

fron my observation,

the Commission was impressively

organized and a highly motivated, hard working group.

9. Mr. Ichord stated that he had no further questions

thanked us

for easing his mind. We offered to

produce any other documents he might wish to see. Mr.

Ichord

replied that this would not be necessary. He returned
