At Miami, Florida:

in the Miami area through informants and physical surveillance

when he is in the Miami area

ADMINISTRATIVE

A copy of tis report is furnished to WFO for

ther information inasmuch as subject spends considerable

time in that city.

The period of this report overlaps the date of

previous report in order to include results of investigation

which were not available at that time.

As previously reported, Miami telephone numbers

JE 4-0717 and PL 8-5535 were among those numbers called

from subject's apartment at 40 Central Park South, NYC.

Investigation at the Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph

Co., Miami, reflects that these numbers are out of service

and

records are not available which would indicate the sub-

scriber when the calls were made.

The following information is included in the

administrative section

in order not to jeopardize this

valuable informant:

On March 30, 1965, NY 3610-C-TE was interviewed

by SAs CHARLES G. DONNELLY and RICHARD A. ANDERSON and he

advised he is with CHARLIE WHITE almost everyday. He stated

he believed CHARLIE WHITE has obtained a gambling stamp..

He

probably obtained the gambling stamp in Floridaand it is

probably presently in the possession of CHARLIE's

son,

CHUCK DELMONICO.
