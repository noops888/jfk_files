REPS$

(a) HKi=w=1607, 30 karch 1956

(b) HKhi-n-1505, 28 December 1955

DATE 27 April 1256

Regarding reference (a) the Station concurs fully with the proposed prosotion

of Arthur G. Vaivada and desires

also at this tine to bring to the attention

of Headquarters the merits

of granting Vaivaja staff status either

concurrently with the promotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasible.

The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status,

for a number of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Vaivada has not been

entitled

to the standard step increases that accrue to regular iS enployees •

Koreover he has not had the benefii of recent legislative increases in basic

salary rates,

such thai his salary, originally set l6 August 1954 at the then

GS-9 levels

is stil $5050.00 per animo

Perhaps of more importance than

the foregoing consideracions is the fact that this agent has been and is

losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance, and other nore long

term advantages availacle to staff personnel. The agent has several tines

expressed to the case officer his concern, as a fanily nan,

over the fact that

he is not receiving retirement credits with his years of service. Vaivadals.

expressed career interests lie in contired employment by KUBARK, nore

especially in the area of l

assignments in the field, and in

view of his qualities of character and nigh level of performance for XI BARK

the Station has no hesitation in recommending to Headcuarters that he be

marded the desired change in status.

In view of the agent's present salary level it is recommended that the

pronotion iron his present graie be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per

anun salary-of-05,915.00. If Headquarters concurs-in-the-recommendation-

that the agent be granted staff officer status, the agent would move up to

tbe GS-ll Erade at that time.

Jin the past has pursued his activities on behalf of

this organization as somewhat of a profitable avocation.

Pis performance,

nonetheless, has teen outstanding from the point of rier of initiativ,

production and understanding of operational principles. Fe would now

like to make it a career but lacks sufficient irfomation upon which to

base a decision and, being partially aware of the uncertainties involved,

Insists upon naintaining an alternate vocation.

In pursuit of this latter

objective, he plans to move

in June or July of 1953 and

establish hirself there on a perranent basis.

His inquiries were to

ascertain what effect these plars would have upon his present and future

relationship with this organization.

3. I advised

_to continue with his plans as outlined above

stipulating only that he remain in his present location until after

necessarily have to be determired at a later date but requested him to

keep us inforred of his plans on a contiming basis, assuring hir. that

it would do no harm to request such assistance as he might need.

In this

connection, I advised him to request foral training, which he has never

had, implying that this would be granted, and suggested that a formal

contract, future compensation, travel experse and so forth could best be

negotiated here at that time.

5. I recommend, therefore, that
