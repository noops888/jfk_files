OCCURRENCE: The Special Group heard Mr. Merchant state his opinion that the only

solution is to move the Guatemalan train activities to the United States even though

the U. S. could probably not get away with this either.

A number of alternative

base sites for the training of the Cubans was considered both in the United States,

in Puerto Rico,

or in the Panama Canal zone. Mr. Douglas

felt the "U. S. capability for intervention in Cuba will probably not be

effective

enough unless there is more overt participation than has been contemplated to date."

"Mr. Grey supported this general position, stating that when the current Cuban

plan was approved, the situation in that country was different than it is now.

Since then, the Cubans have received sizeable amounts of bloc arms and have or-

ganized a malitia. Mr. Gray wondered how a few hundred exiles could be."

"Mr. Mann expressed the opinion that the way to proceed is to seal Cuba off from

the rest of Latin America and settle down for a one- or

two-year wait..."

vere frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation

was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba,

"The Attorney General inquired

about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt

against him." Lansdale replied, "There is no rallying point for active opposition."

The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities

by Castro in the hemisphere.

A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of

July. Taylor emphasized need for summaries of results "and a statement of future al-

OCCURRENCE:

President Kennedy's visit to Mexico greatly enhanced U.S. goodwill in

Mexico.

It fulfilled U.S. plans to impress upon Castro that Mexico is solidly with the

United States and the West.

State believes this should ease the way for future discussions

about Cuba with the Mexicans.

Re: Operation MONGOOSE, the joint communique issued by

President Kennedy and President Lopez Mateos included a phrase which was

'They proposed

to respect and maintain the principles of non intervention--whether this intervention

may come from a continental or extracontinental state--and of self-determination of

peoples.". In response to a Lansdale query, the Department of State noted that "There

were no developments resulting from the President's trip to Mexico including the text

of the joint United States-Mexico communique which alter the basic guidelines which govern

the Cuba Project." Lansdale noted that the CIA now had 45 Astansy in Havana operating.

In addition there are agents and teams in the provinces.

OCCURRENCE: McCone explained the situation which has resulted in a group led by

¿Senor. Boschacquiring B-26's which are now in Costa Rica prepared to conduct a bombing

raid on Cuba.

The group discussed a draft State Department cable to various Latin

American embassies related to this incident. It was agreed that the point should be

made in the cable that any such contemplated raid would be premature at this time. Dis-

association of the United States from any such endeavor was to be accomplished by leaking

stories of the impending raid to the press.
