Action Required: Renew the Project

Reference: IN 11879

1 On 28 June 1963 we pouched to Headquarters the renewal

for Project LIMOTOR under FITA-21650.

We had every reason to

belleve that after a plausible period of tive that the Froject

was undergoing usual Headquarters processing for renewal.

were therefore astonished and disappointed to say the least to

leam in Reference (which ve recelved on 19 September, and the

separate dover to which ve received on 17 Septenber) that on

1 August a Project Extension was requested and not a Project

Renewal, In future instances we request that you notify the

Station immediately when the usual steps for renewal have not

been taken, particularly where Projects are mly extended and

where you expect the Station to reply three days after the

receipt of a dispatch in order to allow for timely Headquarters

submissions about which the Station was belatedly notifled.

Other priorities have precluded earlier response to Reference.

answer belor the questions posed in paragraph 5 of attachment
