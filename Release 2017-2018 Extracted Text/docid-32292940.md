BURAL needs tele cat subject

add an additional telephone to the present location of

PH 701-C*.

This new telephone will be an extension from

a building being built by BUFALINO approximately three

blocks away from the present location of PH 701-0*.

The simplest means to continue this source's

activity would be to replace the present altered 500 MR-3

Instrument with an altered 44A block.

This new service

will be installed 12/9/64. This alteration can be under-

taken with full security, using same pretext as used

originally in obtaining services of PH 701-C*.

The above-described change will be done by

Philadelphia UACB.
