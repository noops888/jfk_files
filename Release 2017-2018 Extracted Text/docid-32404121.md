CENTER for the STUDY of INTELLIGENCE

5 December 1995

Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records

Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC

20530

Dear David:

This is in response to your letter of November 8, 1995

in which you conveyed the request of the Assassination

Records Review Board to be provided access to "any and all

internal CIA histories or retrospective studies or reports"

on several topics.

We have begun to identify histories and other items

that would meet the Board's request. The CIA Historian is

assisting in this effort.

I suggest that we discuss with you or your staff the

possibility of modifying the request somewhat.

Several of

the

items mentioned in your letter cover a broad range of

topics. It would be helpful, for example, if the pertinent

historical time period for each item were specified, as well

as what topics in

the requested items would be of interest

to the Board.

This would assist us in excluding sensitive

information that the Board would regard as non-relevant to

the assassination or to the scope of the investigation.

Given the sensitivity of some of the materials

requested, we would

prefer that you designate one or two

people to

review the histories and other items in

our.

offices.

Please let me know your views on the above suggestions.

We appreciate the constructive efforts that you and your

colleagues have made over the past year to work

out

reasonable,

secure ways of handling documents.

For our part, we are

committed to being as responsive as possible to the Board's

interests.

Sincerely,

fishin there ine

John F. Pereira
