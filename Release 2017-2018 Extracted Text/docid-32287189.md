It is to be noted that the electronic firing device

used in the two bombs recovered by the RCMP at Ottawa,

Canada, on March 29 and April 3, 1972, are quite similar

to the electronic firing device which was recovered from

the "Lancastrian Prince" at Miami, Florida, in 1968 ir

the case entitled "ORLANDO BOSCE

AVILA: ET AL, CHS. -

FIRING OR TAMPERING WITH VESSEL - CONSPIRACY", Bureau file

45-10854, Miami file 45-1175.

One of the bomos recovered

in Ottawa was in a shopping bag of Jackson's-Byrons, Miami,

a department store in the Miami area, and the two principal

In view of the foregoing, it appears that the same

individual who constructed the two bombs recovered in Ottawa

may be identical to the individual who constructed the

electronic firing device in the

BOSCh case.

The following investigation was conducted:

MM 1337-S, who furnished valuable information in

the BOSCH case, recalled that on one occasion BOSCH introduced

him to a Cuban exile who was employed at Thurow Electronics,

located at N. W. 23rd Street and 18th Avenue, Miami, and

indicated that this individual was responsible for constructing

the firing device used on BOSCH's bombs co)

On May 22, 1972, Mr. HAROLD BELINKY, who operates

Thurow Electronics,

which is a subsidiary of Lykes Electronics,

searched his records and advised that JESUS GARCIA, 95

N. W. Il7th Street, Miami, a Cuban exile, Social Security

Number 261-74-4530, worked for him as a driver from January

11, 1968, to February 29, 1969, and is now employed by Atlas

TV, Miami Beach.

On May 24, 1972, INS Iecords revealed that JESUS

GARCIA FERNANDEZ, Alien Number A12 490 266, born January 31,

1936, Havana, Cuba, Social Security Number 261-74-4530,

resides at 95 N. Wo 117th Street, Miami.

GARCIA resided at 431 Audubon Avenue, New York

City, from February, 1963, to October, 1965, and at 561

West 187th Street, New York City, from October, 1965, to

November, 1966.

This file disclosed that he was a member of the

Movimiento Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria

(MIRR). This is the organization of which ORLANDO BOSCH

was the leader. The file also reflected that GARCIA informed

MM 105-20541

INS at time of his arrival in the United States on September

9, 1961, that he had worked for RCA in Havana from 1947 to

1953, after CASTRO took over and while serving in the Cuban

militia he became a member of the underground anti-CASTRO

organization known as Triple A. His immediate chief was

JORGE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ, Who had been an ex-Major in the

Revolutionary Army (GONZALEZ was one of the defendants in

the BOSCH case and is now serving a prison term) GARCIA

told INS that he was involved in various acts of sabotage

and destroyed a valuable piece of machinery while he was

working for the Compania Litographia de Cuba before seeking

asylun in the Venezuelan Embassy when he learned that the

Dier (Cuban Intelligence) was searching for him.

A photograph of GARCIA was obtained from INS and

on May 24, 1972, MM 1337-S identified this photograph as....

being identical to the individual to whom he had been

introduced at Thurow Electronice by ORLANDO BOSCH. (U)

This photograph refreshed the recollection of

MM 1337-S and he was then able to relate the following

informations (Ul)

Sometime during the early part of 1968 BOSCH asked

MM 1337-S to drive him to Thurow Electronics. MM 1337-S

complied and when they arrived at this establishment BOSCH

got out and went inside alone and returned about five minutes

later with GARCIA. When introducing GARCIA to MM 1337-S,

BOSCH stated, "This is the professional electronics technician

who manufactures the bombs." GARCIA then said to BOSCH,

Place a call to

ORLANDO MIRANDA." BOSCH turned to MM 1337-S and said, "I

need your address so that the relay can be sent to your

address, for security reasons."*( U)

Subsequently, MM 1337-s received the relay and it

was subseguently turned over to BOSCH * (1)

MM 1337-S said this is the first time that he had

ever heard of ORLANDO MIRANDA, who is the brother of AIMEE

MIRANDA, one of the defendants in the BOSCH case, who is

also serving a prison term.

(u)

MM 1337S also recalled that shortly thereafter

he went to the home of BOSCH and encountered GARCIA there.

A day or two later Mes. BOSCH told MM 1337-S that after

the visit of MM 1337-S, BOSCH had been experimenting with

explosives and had blown a hole in the ceiling of the

house. She pointed out to MM 1337-S the damage which

had been caused a 21)

MM 1337-S said that he had never seen GARCIA

so far as he could recall on any other occasion with BOSCH

of with other members of the MIRR and he had no idea that

GARCIA was a member of that organization or had had any

previous contact with othex members of that organization x1)

It is to be noted MM 1337-s had not yet been

developed as a security informant by this office at the

time of the above described incidents af)

MM 1337-S has advised that he has not seen GARCIA

in contact with SANTIAGO GONZALEZ OI FRANCISCO NARANJO OF

any other member of their organization, Frente de Integracion

Nacionalista (FIN) and investigation in this

case to date
