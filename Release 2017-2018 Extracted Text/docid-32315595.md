get him to leave at which timo, HANDRINOS took a swing at VITALIS

and there was considerable trouble, several people tyed to hit

hin and they were unable to knock him out until PATER the waiter

pulled a blackjack and hit him over the head with it.

According to the Informant, ANTHONY ZERILLI thought
