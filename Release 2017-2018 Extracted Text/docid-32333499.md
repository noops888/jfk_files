Please refer to your 14220 dated 2nd April, 1963.

The authorities in the Bahamas report that the incidents related

in your memorandum sound probable although there are minor discrepancies.

ORANGE CAY is situated 18 miles South of SOUTH RIDING ROCK, and a position

60 miles to the south of the Cay is just north of the CAY SAL group.

However, DOG BANK is not traced by that name and DOG CAY, DOG ROCKS, etco,

are located in the EXUMA CAYS nearly 200 miles N.E. of CAY SAL.

It is of course possible that a bank in the CAY SAL area is known

locally as DOG BANK.

The Bahamas authorities state that it is true that more patrols

have been carried out in the CAY SAL area, but these, with one exception,

have been undertaken by the Royal Navy.

There is no

record that the

"Alisan" was ever searched,

The authorities are naturally interested in the report in your

third paragraph that the bomb used was made in the Bahamas.

be interested to know whether you have any further information to show

whether the allegation is that this bomb was made in one of the

Cuban revolutionary camps or whether there is any suggestion that

Cubans resident in the Bahamas

were involved.
