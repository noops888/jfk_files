Re Chicago airtel 7-13-67,

Mexico City airtel 7-27-67,

"BuCab 7-28-67, and report of SA WILLIAM F. ROEMER 7-18-67 at

Chicago.

As reported, Attorney JORGE VAZQUEZ ROBLES, Chief

of

Inspection service of Mexican Immigration, advised that

agents from his office would be making further inquiry at

the house at Las Nubes No.

on

2 in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico,

17-28-67.

It is noted that the information

which led to the

location

of this house was based on information received

from the files of the Mexican Immigration Inspection Service,

and they independently determined the significance of this

address.

It is known that upon orders of the Secretary of

Government, he had planned to send 'five agents from his office

to Cuernavaca to locate HAROLD DERBER.

They were to take

advantage of this tri

to also conduct inquiry at Las Nubes

No. 2 independently

RE: 3 92-3171-2066

matter became resolved and therefore no

MEX 92-13

In view of the instructions in referenced Bureau

cable, Mexican Immigration has been requested to hold any

further action in this matter in abeyance

However, it is

noted that. the Undersecretary of "Government has previously

shown himself to be personally interested in this matter.

If Subject is in Mexico it is in violation of instructions

given him and his attorney, and Mexican Immigration may feel

constrained to take affirmative action in this matter.

It is

will be necessary to inform Mexican Immigration Ofhis location.

Asofthis moment

• Mexican Immigration still has the matter

under advisemen

Mexico City has never considered that CAIN was the

"wealthy American" who purchased the house in Cuernavaca.

It

is assumed that this house was purchased under a false name

or nat chi any save corporation so nie pipe i a

In view of the information that Subject is a

dedicated

golfer, contact was established on 7-27-67 with Mr. HARRY WRIGHT,

a prominent reliable American and contact of this Office, who

is a life-long resident of Mexico, and known to frequent

Cuernavaca area.

The problem was explained to Mr. WRIGHT and

he advised he would make discreet inquiries over the weekend

of 7-29-67 at the golf club in Cuernavaca.

On 7-31-67, Mr.

WRIGHT advised that he saw no trace of Subject at this club.

He advised that he in turn had contacted an American known to

im to be reliable

In view of the instructions that Mexico City should

use extreme discretion, it is not believed that direct contact

with personnel of the

olf club would be in compliance with

these instructions.

It is noted that the State of Morelos has always been

notorious for corruption and that any attempt to work with

1uea1 authorities there would probably be counter-productivell
