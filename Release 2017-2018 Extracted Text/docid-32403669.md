MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : HSCA Access to Mexico City History

1.

HSCA requested access to some 200 pages of the

three-volume history of Mexico City - about a third of

the material. The substantive content runs the gamut from

the history of Mexico University through detailed operation-

al support capabilities and high level political connect

ions and activities.

It is

an impressive accumulation of

operational activity - classical sources and methods, as

well as detailed revelations about past events.

2. We pointed out that the agreement between Chairman

Stokes and DDCI Carlucci directly faced the issue of the

irrelevancy of the vast majority of the history, and the

sensitivity of it. The HSCA position had been that it had

to verify this, and the access given to senior levels was

to satisfy this. Now it was being requested in connection

with depositions, which would serve to get this material

a Committee transcript. Since some two-thirds of the

station's history (the work covers 1947 through 1969) pre-

of the President, that clearly had nothing to do with

the

Committee's charter.

was based entirely on sources to which Committee investi-

gator's have had access. Our problem was the overall

collection,

and particularly some of the substance of the

history. He asked if he could come back and ask for it,

if they wanted to use something in particular.

I said

that we had never closed a door completely, but that the

Director's condition was

fairly clear.

Those things

relevant to their authorized inquiry were already in

their hands, so I could not think what they would have

to use from

this.. They will ask us, and we can react

when they do.
