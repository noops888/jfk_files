The following

Information was

y onically provided

bY\NY 7856-0A to Special Agent WILLIAM M. MACKEY, Federal Bureau

Investigation (FBI), Washington Metropolitan Field Office,fon

1/16-17/92:

Source learned Tampa, Florida, attorney FRANK RAGANO

(phonetic) would be appearing on the ABC News show "PRIME TIME

LIVE" on 1/16/92 claiming to have information that former

TEAMSTERS President JIMMY HOFFA instructed La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

bosses to kill President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963. Based upon

source's past relationship with

both HOFFA and RAGANO, source

categorized RaGaNo's clalms as "Iles". fal

Source advised source's relationship with HOFFA began

in the late 1950s while HOFFA was a Vice President of the

TEAMSTERS.

Source's relationship with HOFFA lasted until HOFFA's

disappearance *Source

described the relationship between source

and HOFFA as "close" noting that source was one of HOFFA's few

associates who could meet with or call HOFFA at any time without *

an appointment.

Source stated HOFFA offered source a position as

one of HOFFA'S trusted assistants which source respectfully

declined.

5)

In

regard to RAGANO, [source recalled attending only l

three or four meetings with HofFA and others in the early 1960s

which were also attended by RAGANO, Although source has not had

contact with RAGANO for many years, source recalled RAGANO (like

most people attempting to contact HOFFA) was required to make an

appointment to see HOFFA in the early 1960s. Source was not aware

if RAGANO'S status with HOFFA changed in later years (4l

EDDIE

in Washington, D.C. and an attorney (name not recalled) who was a

close associate of the BUFFALINO LCN family. Source did not

consider RAGANO an attorney "close" to HOFFA.

Source advised HOFFA was very close to LCN bOss SANTOS

TRAFFICANTE and other LN members. Source said HOFFA was capable

of ordering a contract "hit".

"doing favors" for high level LN members and, if HOFFA requested

a contract "hit", the "hit" probably would have been done by the

LCN for free.

## Page 5

Released under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 USC 2107 Hote):

DATE: 11-14-2017

Source identified JOSEPH CONNO (phonetic) as a current

TEAMSTERS official in New York City. Source described CONNO as

one of HOFFA's close assistants in the 1960s who may have

knowledge of hofFa's activities prior to the agsassination of

PRESIDENT KENNEDY.

source commented that if RAGANO's claims about an IN contract

against PRESIDENT KENNEDY were true, RAGANO would have been

"killed by the LCN years ago. Based on RAGANO's claims that HOFFA,

through RAGANO, requested TRAFFICANTE to arrange for the murder

of PRESIDENT KENNEDY, RAGANO should have been killed shortly

after PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S assassination. This would have been

done to prevent RAGANO from identifying either HOFFA or

TRAFFICANTE as orchestrating the "hit".
