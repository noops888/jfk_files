SA LEON F. ANDREWS, JR., and advised that this office was

attempting to determine

if STEVE MAGADDINO was then in

Niagara Falls, New Yorke.

It is noted that CORNETTA for several years worked

for the United States Bureau of Narcotics in Sicily and in

New York City and is familiar with the activities of hoodlums

engaged in narcotics activities in the New York City area.

CORNETTA speaks the Sicilian language fluently.

CORNETTA

telephonically contacted the residence of STEVE MAGADDINO

in Niagara Falls, New York, under a pretext of being Mc. COSTA

from Italy who had been asked to contact MAGADDINO upon his

arrival in this country.

CORNETTA stated that a woman who

appeared to be Mrs. STEVE I

IDDINO informed him that she did

not know a Mr. COSTA and refused to furnish any information

as to whether or not STEVE MAGADDINO was at home at

that time.

Pretext calls were also made to the Magaddino

Nemorial Chapel by FRED CORNETTA without determining the

whereabouts of MAGADDINO.

On 1/19/63, BU 280-C* reported the presence of

STEVE MAGADDINO at the Magaddino Memorial Chapel at 3:03 p.m.,

that day.

At that time STEVE MAGADDINO engaged PETER A.

MAGADDINO, his son, in a conversation all of which was in

the Sicilian language.

The conversation between PETER A.

MAGADDINO and STEVE MAGADDINO was interrupted upon the

arrival of an unidentified man ho was selling tickets for

a "Sports Night" affair which would feature CLETUS. BOYER Of

the New York Yankees as a principal speaker.

the attention of the New York Office is

invited to a meeting held in Nagara Falls, New York, on

9/24/62, of members of the "MAGADDINO Family."

Based upon information furnished by the Bureau translator,

it would appear that MAGADDINO was discussing the problems

arising out of the death of JOSEPH PROFACI in New York City.
