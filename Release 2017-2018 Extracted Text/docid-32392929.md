SUMMARY:

During the reporting period this Project conlinued

with no change.

The KDAFGHANS continued to provide

the Station. with

protographic coverage of visitors to the Cubail Embassy.

A new case:

officer took over the project at the beginning

of

the period and has

spont the major part of his mectings witli KDAFGHAN-1 and 2 on dis-

cussing and planning ways to improve the percentage of identifications

made by

them.

What follows is a description of the operation as it

11OW

stands and the Station's plans to improve it.

2.

PRESENT KDAFGHAN ROUTINE:

Visual coverage of the

entrance

to the Cuban Embassy compound is provided from 0900 to 1800 (the

anproximate hour at which lighting conditions prevent further

pliotography with the present equipment.) Embassy hours are 0800-

2100, approximately.

KDAFGHAN-1 provides the majority of the mai-

apowei,

with KDAFGHAN-2 filling in for rest breaks,

lunch and while

KDAFGHAN-1 processes the previous day's take.

The general praciice

is to observe the entrance without optical

assistance until a person

ol vehicle is seen to be entering or leaving

the

gate area.

The

restricted size of the aperture possible in the OP for this viewing

the observer shifts his head a few inches to the

reflex finder of the camera and is given a 20 X magnification of

"the target.

This is more than adequate for identification of any

target.

If the target is unknown and/or a previous photograph las

not been taken,

the observer takes one.

At the same time he records

the time of arrival/departure, whether the target is known or

unknown, and records any obvious identifying data such as license

plate, apparent nationality, apparent occupation, etc.

Both seem to have adapted to a very

boring routine

Their eyesight, which has been the subject of quite

a few off-the-record comments at both Headquarters and at the

Station (viz, that they are blind), was checked out thoroughly,

but innocuously, by asking them who

and such a person was

at the gate or

in photos

and by

asking them to read

small print film-processing instructions..

While KDAFGHAN-2's

eyesight is definitely poorer than that of KDAFGHAN-1, she easily

identified the subjects and was able to read the test literature

with no problem.

She was observed carefully while manning the

OP and she missed no one in that one and one-half hour period.

Previous cases of missing known targets scheduled to visit the

Embassy are more probably the result of boredom and a resultant

lack of attention.

Their job requires them to be hermits.

To break them out

of this rut,

the Station will soon start altering their work

hours to provide more extended coverage of the

target, and

them more interesting work to do.

PRESENT KDAFGHAN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT:

Op is located on the roof of

a three-story apartment house

located about eighty yards from the compound entrance (see

Attachment B). Concealment is excellent.

Windows on other

floors allow visual observation of most of the compound facing

the CP and of the entrance to the Consulate.

However,

they do

not permit photography, except on a selected basis, because of

the concealment problem. The OP proper is a small

about five by

six feet in what used to be the maid's quarters.

A captain's chair,

tripod, camera, lens and a small worktable

have been fitted in between the various plumbing fistures.

Adjacent to this is another room of approximately twice the size

which contains a desk,, cot, the printer and a wardrobe for

storing photographic materials.

This room has

a large picture

window overlooking the entrance to the Consulate.

to LNERGO, it is of little value, as presently constituted,

the Station. There are other, and cheaper, means of obtaining

photographs of PCS and TDY personnel.

No identification or

operational

use is made of the photographs of the unidentified

no operational use is made

The present enlarger lens has a fungus growth which

lowers photographic quality. This will be repaired or replaced.

Since the move to this OP, a street sign in the line

of sight to the target area obstructs or spoils

photographs.

This prevents the Station from using the photo-

graphs with

agent personnel or contacts who might be able to
