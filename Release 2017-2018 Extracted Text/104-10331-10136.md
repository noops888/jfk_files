Talking Points for Meeting

with Jeremy Gunn, 3 Feb 98

Background:

Gunn has been with the JFK Assassination

• Records Review Board since its inception in 1994. When the

Board's Executive Director resigned in the summer of 1997,

Gunn replaced him, but continued as General Counsel as well.

may be accompanied to your meeting by two of his senior

Skwirot.

Suggested Discussion Points:

(U) 1. CIA is committed to meeting the deadline of 1

September 1998 for completing the review of records and

transferring them to the Board. Recently we shifted seven

additional contractor/reviewers to the JFK team, bringing

the total to 20. If necessary, additional resources will be

made available.

(U) 2. The merger of former HRG into OIM does not create new

impediments to CIA's ability

to respond to requests from the

Board and will not slow. down the document review.

...

(S) 3. We are looking forward to meeting the Board's

Chairman, Judge Tunheim on 18 February. We have followed up

on Tunheim's request to obtain from

We sue to lowed un

records and other information related to Oswald's activities

in Mexico. We have asked the Mexico City Station to provide

any additional information by mid-February.

(U) 4. Per the Board's request, we are sending a team of

reviewers to the Board on 4-6 February to review materials

from the Army, JCS, and Presidential Libraries. This joint

approach makes sense to us, and is preferable to having

documents circulate from agency to agency. The process seems

to have worked well earlier for other records.

(U) 5. We intend to respond fully to the Board's many

informal and formal requests for additional information.

(See listing. of requests, dated 18 December 1997.) However,

to the extent that resources are devoted to searching files

and compiling information for a response, those resources

are drawn away from the document review.

We urge the

Board's staff to avoid overly broad requests that may lead

to extensive searches.

(U) 6.

We appreciate the cooperation of Gunn's staff in

persuading the Board to accept our recommendation that some

40,000 pages from the sequestered collection be declared

non-relevant. This avoided the need to review these

materials for declassification.)
