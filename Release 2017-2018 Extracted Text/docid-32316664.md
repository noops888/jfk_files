MM T-1, who has been involved in Cuban revolu-

tionary activities during the past four years and who has

furnished reliable information in the past, on September 5,

1961, advised that SAUL SAGE, an American, has been recently

seen frequenting the hangouts of Cuban revolutionists in

Miami, Florida... MM T-1 said that SAGE had belonged to the

would-be organization of GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, an American

soldier of fortune who was previously a member of the

Cuban Revolutionary Air Forçe. HEMMING, in June, 1961, had

amassed a group of about 20 Americans for the purpose of

participating in some military action against Cuba. HEMMING

and his group were not accepted by the different Cuban

revolutionary organizations in Miami. HEMMING's group

thereafter dissolved, although HEMMING continues to remain

in Miami and in contact with different Cuban revolutionists.

MM T-1 said that SAGE had gone to Chicago,

Illinois, and California, where he contacted a number of

HEMMING's friends. SAGE

subsequently visited Honduras.

SAGE claimed that he had been in contact with a Lieutenant

in Intelligence in the Honduran Army and other persons who

promised to allow HEMMING's group to set up a training camp
