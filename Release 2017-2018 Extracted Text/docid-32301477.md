LA COSA NOSTRA

PHILADELPHIA DIVISION

AR

Special Investigative

Division

As the Bureau is aware the Phila. Div. has in recent

months utilized an Edwards Model M-75 Binaural Pocket Tape Re-

corder. in complementing the efforts of pH 672-C-TE.

The use of

this device is surprisingly simple and in no way poses a problem

of security 1f it is properly attached to person's body.

Utilization of this device has definitely established

PH 672-C-TE as a member of La Cosa Nostra.

It has confirmed

the membership of several others suspected of being members

and has obtained conversations which enabled Agents working AR

matters to better comprehend the struggles, jealousies and

treachery within La Cosa Nostra's ranks.

This device, if used properly, could be widely used

by the Bureau in its efforts to confirm la Cosa Nostra member-

ship of CIs who claim to be members.

In addition the tapes

would be of immeasurable evidentiary value in proving the

actual La Cosa Nostra membership of persons recorded if the

informant is ever called upon to testify in this regard.

By separate communication several tape recordings of

do ta pite orater over be a a dope we be detente

to the FBI Laboratory for "dubbing."

Copies will be designated

for the Special Investigative Division which should consider

utilizing these tapes as educational aides at Criminal Intelli-

gence In-Service lectures.

It is belleved that exposure of

Agents attending Criminal Intelligence In-Service training to

the successes of this technique could conceivably augment the

••educational value of the Bureau's AR lectures, if this is not
