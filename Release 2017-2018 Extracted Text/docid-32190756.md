Commumist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

against the C. party of Amerlea but by the time the

reactionaries vers getting started it was announced

that it had been disclosed that it seemad I1ke the

entrene Fight had been active.

This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

C. party that had done 1t because Kennedy vas a

friend of the working class but the work of the extreme

right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober

the masses that 1t was the same caliber of people who

when he stated that the fact that the Murder of Bill

Moore, M Edgar Evers and others in the south going

by without punishment had set the stage for the

Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone rsadily

agreed.
