Regarding Giancana's apartment in Beirut which is close

proximity to the officer's lub, it should be noted that the

officer's club is located on the waterfront in the Beirut Harbor.

On one side is the Phoenicia Hotel (an Intercontinental Hotel owned

by Pan American Airlines) and on the other side a cemetery.

the rear of the officer's club are low class two story buildings

which have been occupied by the same families for yearsa

ка

Declassify

In addition, the Israelis have never bombed the officer's

club or any other building in Beirut.

The only raid in Beirut was

in April, 1973, and no buildings were bombed in Beirut. The Israelis.

bombed only one building during this raid on the outskirts of Beirut

to cause a diversion and in this area are housed refugees living in

temporary huts and shacks.

Bombings in Beirut are practically a

weekly affair and very little attention is given to them. If there

is no obvious reason for a bombing, the Lebanese usually blame the

Israelis or the CIA.
