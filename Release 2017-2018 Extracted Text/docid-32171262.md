Wichne] Henry Beaumon towns is known to you as the

British solicitor involved

in the celebrated PROFUMO/KEELER/

IVANOV scandal of 1963.

EDDOWES was interviewed more than

once by your New York field office in that year.

It appears

that EDDOWES is currently researching a book on

the assassina-

tion of the late resident, kennedy.

He is being assisted in

this task by James MichaelIVARIER a private investigator who i

accompanied EDDOWES on his visit

-to the United States in June,

1963 and who was also interviewed by your New York field

office during that visit. Engin

I am enclosing a copy of a report from a reliable source

which indicates the nature and extent

of EDDOWES' researches

and the line he intends taking in the book.
