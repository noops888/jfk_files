il.

Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of

concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known.

Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City.

The Station

in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such

coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail-

able for assignment to these targets. As Headquarters is aware, this Station

can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high

enough priority to cover.

For example, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957,

1960 and 1961; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue

the coverage.

3. " Presently, Elena, VASQUEZ Gomez, one of the persons referred

to in reference, works for General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio, pro-

Communist former President of Mexico. Coverage of CARDENAS by

LIENVOY means a certain amount of coverage of VAS UEZ Gomez.
