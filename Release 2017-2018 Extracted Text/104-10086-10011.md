coverage. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

(by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to ras

exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT).

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

the first base ad it operated strictly on an

e: orimental basis in the early stages. I think the Hexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Sranish Colonial stone house) through LINOUSINE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart.

This base was closed

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released

puolic by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement

with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding

to be built

on this site).

LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base

to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the same side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the soviet inbassy. The agents in LEaTh

in one of a row of four hous

south side of the Soviet Embassy compound

which the Mexico Station

ased in about 1958 (check date), also using

LIPOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operstion was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet

personnel (uno at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

Ramon Alvarez Mexican citizen of U.S. mother Who taught elerentary level aty

the American School)! (Ramon collected the film esta

developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips. The master plan

was for LIGALLA film to ie processed inside, ISD man from 1957 to 1959 (Harper

to accumulate, the inside co (i'ahoney) becane disgusted and took the film out

for(Ramon's brother-in-law to process (probably early 1959). Thus Ramon became

About nid 1962 (check date) LiVOY outside Moxi root asked

for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban,

and Satellite Enbassies.

wes

disconnected.

However,

as I recall, the lexicans connected 5 Cuban lines,

5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 Yugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live

monitor lino made short

sunnaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.m. (passed by Flick to Goodrasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were tyoed and passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so.: Those transcripts which had

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening

post the day after

the transcript (of other conversations

el) was

tipod. These reels were taken to another location sel

were translated

and typed. In the case of ite fuerk

sons, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date

Ersation because of the volume of

Russian conversations amon

embers of the Soviet Embassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell) to take to Boris.

Herbert lianell and his wife Barbara

handled all of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. My job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling himself Oswald was

probably an American. However, here again there was

a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones

ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor) proceased the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later ve got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operators, cleared the canera each day whether there was angRismaya a full

The Cuban

embassy coverage had nore sophisticated equipment (a pulse calera) but it

frequently developed nechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnardi andr

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorna l'aciay screened

the film inside the station.

•I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line.. It was picked u; and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay vas caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcripts every made in languages other than Spanish or English because Win

Scott could read only those two languages and he cers.
