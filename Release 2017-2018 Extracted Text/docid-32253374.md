MANUEL

RAY, MANUEL REY

By memo of February 17, 1978,

I submitted to you a review

of FBI file #97-4546, Section 1, Serials X-24 and mentioned

that two additional

files were read by Patricia ort.

Since no notes were taken on two files, I returned to the

FBI on March 16 to finish the review.

At that time, I

found that additional material had been added to the

Manolo Ray section,

and three days were required to finish

the assignment.

This second review was done on March 16,

17 and 20.

Attached is a report of the information obtained from the

March file review on Manolo Ray:

Also attached is a

suggested list of names and topics to be indexed from

this review, as the material read was extensive and not

all names are pertinent to this Committee.

Please note that the first file review on Manolo Ray has

filed under #005990. For purposes of continuity, it

would be helpful if this

number were assigned to the material

presented in this memorandum.

File #65-76238

1. Teletype 12 May 1977 has deletions on RAY from INS.

3. June 1, 1977 telex to Director from San Juan.

Marked Secret

On May 23, 1977, an FBI source furnished information that a

known Cuban intelligence agent stated that when

a certain woman

(not named) visited Puerto

Rico in January 1977, MANOLO RAY

told her he was interested in meeting with Cuban Intelligence

Service (CUIS). RAY suggested he send her a letter when

she

returned to Cuba but CARLOS made it appear that CUIS did not

want any third party involvement. The FBI informant said that

RAY's meeting with CUIS would be in the near future.

San Juan

reports that, to date (6/1/77) RAY has not presented

his permit to reenter

the United States for extension or

reissue nor have they received any information from INS as a

therefore unable to track any foreign travel on the part of Ray.

RAY is being observed at his home and San Juan

is making an

attempt to develop a "neighborhood type source" that can advise

on his travel.

San Juan considers the possiblity

• that CUIS

could contact RAY in the United States, but this is contrary

to their usual method of operation.

Bureau is requested to forward this information to Legats in

Mexico City, Caracas and CIA.

Ref: Bureau teletype to San Juan dated 3/12/77 entitled

OCELOT

An informant advised San Juan in April 1977 that during January

1977 (an

unnamed person) was visiting relatives in Puerto Rico.

At the direction of

a known CUIS officer in Panama, known as

"The General", this unnamed individual contacted

MANOLO RAY.

The source advised that RAY is a Cuban exile now living in

Puerto Rico.

Around 1974, RAY had a construction business in Jamacia but had

to leave because of trouble with his visa.

The source believes

the Cuban government wanted to get him out of Jamacia. The

unnamed visitor in Puerto Rico told RAY that the Cuban government

could help him reestablish his business in Jamacia.

After the

meeting with

_ Ray stated he would have to think about

the Cuban offer.

A review of San Juan indices reflects RAY's involvement in

anti-Castro activities in Puerto Rico and Miami. He was

last affiliated with Partido Revolucionario del Pueblo (PRP).

The file reflects that there were members of Cuban exile

community who considered RAY

as pro-Castro -- RAY denied this

in an August 24, 1974 interview, saying the rumor was based

on his moderate stand that the best way to get back into Cuba

to overthrow Castro was through negotiations with Castro.

On December 5, 1975, the FBI interviewed RAY who said he had

a contact in Mexico that provided him with information from Cuba

and identified his as JOSE MARMOL DIAZ, Doctor of Commercial

Sciences, Roma

1S, Dept. 201, Conia Juez, Mexico City.

RAY

said MARMOL may have G-2 connections and

feeding him false

information.

On May 18, 1977, RAY's INS file was reviewed in San Juan. There

is a 1½ page INS deletion, File #A7-056-497. The text picks

up as follows:

_------.

Also, if the CIA can with due

caution determine if visa work permit or similar document was

revoked and then reissued by Jamacian authorities.

Bureau is requested to contact their sources in Cuban exile

community to get information on RAY's current activities.

Miami asked to review pertinent files on RAY and forward

information to San Juan.

San Juan will contact its cources and conduct an appropriate

investigation to determine RAY's current activities and contacts.

Wish to eventually interview RAY with goal of recruiting him

as an Operational Asset directed against CUIS. Feel the

interview is premature at this time as San Juan does not have

enough information available to conduct a thorough and probing

interview or is there enough material to confront RAY with.

San Juan thinks this case offers excellent potential for a

double agent operation targeted against CUIS. San Juan is

aware that careful planning is necessary to protect

and

(a valuable source).

4. July 6, 1977 San Juan to Director, Marked Secret

Reference San Juan teletype to Director June 1, 1977.

San Juan has evaluated this matter and makes the following

observations.

The initial allegation concerning RAY was made by

who learned of CUIS interest in RAY from CUIS itself and

from

In addition,

reported that

RAY consented to meet with CUIS. The allegation concerning

RAY is singular in nature and therefore, an investigation of

him should be extremely discreet.

On June 2, 1977,

reported that RAY had indicated an interest in participation

in CORU.

This indicates RAY is acting under the direction

of CUIS

since he has not been active in any anti-Castro

movement in the last two years.

has

been

instructed

to follow RAY's activities as

closely as possible, consistent with appropriate security.

San Juan feels that the investigation in this matter should,

for the present, be extremely discreet, slow and low key.

FCI

case is progressing well, is of known quality and

has excellent potential in both pro and anti-Castro areas.

Nothing should be done to jeopardize the

operation.

If RAY finds out FBI interested in him, he will know his

contact with CUIS has

been blown and, as a result, the source

of information could be traced back to

_ thereby

ending the

usefulness to the Bureau.

Since the FBI has not conducted

an

investigation on RAY fOr

sometime,

San Juan feels that investigative technique now

should be limited to contacts

with established sources

and

record

and agency checks that would not cause suspicion.

Feels

survellances, neighborhood sources, interview of RAY, mail

cover, etc.

would arouse suspicion and compromise

San Juan feels if RAY cooperating with CUIS, it will be a long

going association allowing him to become more deeply involved.

Also, it is possible information on RAY was passed to

test of the

reliability. RAY may already

have been cooperating with CUIS and therefore expected to

report FBI interest in him, thereby implicating

case which is too valuable an operation to loose

offers more potential than RAY.

Even if he were eventually

turned against CUIS,

is in a better position

than RAY to infiltrate CORU for reasons set forth in their

respective investigative files, and thereby enhance his work

with CUIS.

San Juan feels that if for some reason the OCELOT case is not

successful or start to sour, more overt techniques could be

implemented in the RAY, aka ESPIONAGE, CUBA case.

The longer

RAY goes without detection, the harder it will be for him to

pinpoint source of information should he detect an FBI

interest

in him.
