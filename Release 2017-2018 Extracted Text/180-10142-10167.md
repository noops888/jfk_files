VII. Analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico

City

A. Introduction

THIS COPY IS NOT

FOR RELEASE.

After the Warren Commission investigation published

its

report two very important allegations related to Lee

Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City have come to

the attention of the United States investigative agencies.

In 1964, Elena Garro de Paz reported that she had seen Lee

Harvey Oswald, accompanied by two other men, at a party

at the home of Ruben Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of

Silvia Duran.

The Garro and Contreras allegations, in conjunction

with the weakening of Ms. Duran's story raise three major.

questions: did Lee Harvey Oswald or an imposter visit the

Cuban Consulate in Mexico City?; other than his visits

to the Cuban Consulate, what were Lee Harvey Oswald's acti-

vities in Mexico City?; and, was Lee Harvey Oswald travel-

would tend to indicate that Oswald, or someone

impersonating him, visited the Cuban Consulate at least

one and possibly two additional times on September 27,

1963. Silvia Duran says that Oswald first visited the

Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m. requesting

an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final de-

1083

stination. (Duran intervier, 6/6/78, JrK Document 4011681.)

Ms. Duran sent Oswald to obtain photographs that he needed

1084

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in Mexico City?

When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey

Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

-BY Saturday, September 28, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald

had failed to obtain visas at both the Cuban/and

Soviet Embassies.

From sunday, September 29,

through Wednesday morning, October 2, when he

left Mexico City on a bus bound for the United

States, Oswald spent considerable time making

his travel arrangements, sightseeing and checking

again with the Soviet Embassy to learn whether

anything had happened on his visa application. "3!

and making his travel arrangements. It is also entirely

possible that, after his failure to obtain his visas on

Saturday, September 28, that Oswald did not give up completely

and did attend a party where he would have come into contact

with the Cuban Consular officials and, later, sought help

from pro-castro students.

It is entirely possible that Ruben Duran had a "twist

(1138)

party"

on September 30, or October 1 as Elena Garro has claimed.

Ruben, Horacio, Lydia and Silvia Duran all admitted that they

frequently had twist parties in 1963.

when Oswald's activities are not known.

Many of the details of Elena Garro's allegations have

not been, or cannot be, corroborated. For example, Elena's

allegation that

some of the people who had been at the party

were taken to Veracruz under the protection of Governor Lopez

( 1143)

Arias has not been verified. Ruben Duran denied that he

had ever discussed the assassination with Elena Garro. (1yy

Eusebio Azue denied that he had discussed President Kennedy

with Emilio Carballido at a party at the Duran's home as

alleged by Elena Garto.

•) The Committee has not

been able to verify whether or not gaurds were posted out-

side of Elena's home in 1963 as she claims.

But other details of Elena's story mete it hard to

otos audible nant. Perhaps the most striking is the sugges-

tion that Oswald's relationship with Silvia Duran was more

extensive than just the business contacts in the Cuban

1146

Consulate.

Another detail is the manner in which

ETena's

allegations were handled, and the manner in which this

Committee's attempts to investigate those allegations have

147

been frustrated.

In 1965 Elena Garro reported that Silvia Duran

148N

had been Oswald's mistress while he was in Mexico City.

In 1967 this report was confirmed by la CIA agent who talked

to Silvia Duran.

The CIA Station did not consider the

information significant and told the agent to end his

contact with Ms. Durany'so

(see section VI, A, 2, above

that

for details.) If that information is accurate then Silvia

inviting Oswald to a party would not have been that surprising.

Silvia Duran admitted that the Mexican police had questioned

her on this point but denied that she had had an affair

11151

with Oswald. / Ms. Duran denied having any extra-marital

1157

affairs while she was married to Horacio Duran.

of reasons: l) considering the sensitive over-

the FBI's clear jurisdiction; 2) there are ob-

attempted

The Committee's last hope was to locate Elena Garro.

Although the Committee established telephonic contact with

(1111)

Ms. Garro, it was never able to arrange an interview.

Consequently, the Committee was totally frustrated in

this aspect of it's investigation but yet believes that

there is a song possibility that lee Harvey Oswald did

attend a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran.

The Committee also considers it possible that Lee

Harvey Oswald contacted pro-Castro students at the National

Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional

Autonoma de Mexico, heréinafter UNAM.) as claimed by Oscar

1172

Contreras Lartigue.

(See section VI, D, above for details.)

Silvia Duran admitted that she had told Oswald of two ways

in which he could get a Cuban visa: 1) he could get an intran-

sit visa by first obtaining a visa to another Communist ..

country such as Russia; 2) he could obtain a regular Cuban

visa by knowing someone in Cuba who would, after a fashion,

,173

vouch for him.

effort to locate someone trusted by the Cuban Consulate to

p.275

Contreras says that Oswald first contacted him as he was

leaving a round-table discussion at the school of philosophy.

1874

It is known that, in 1963, the Durand

's were clöse friends

with the Chairman of the Philosophy Department at UNAM,

Ricardo Guerra, who held seminars on Kant, Hegel and Marx

in the Durants home!

1115

It is possible, if Silvia Duran had

more than just a purely business relationship with Oswald,

that she referred Oswald to one of Guerra's Marxist seminars

in his search for help. Unfortunately, Contreras does not

name who headed the round table discussion at which he met

Oswald.

Silvia Duran denied that she referred Oswald to

anyone for help.

Mexican Ambassador to East Germany and was not available
