name of his first wife (p 8, 1 8-17)

his first contact with USA intelligence was in Santiago, Cuba

the Vice-consul (p 23, 1 5 etc.):

This was when he first started to

spy on castro for the USA (1958).

Tho' offered, he refused to take money from his government (p 25, 1 12).

In '56 or '57, he met Fidel Castro in the USA, and Carlos Prio

(p 26)

He first went to Cuba in 1957 (p 27, 19).

He met Fidel Castro in Cuba and proceeded to train, go on missions,

and purchase weapons (p 28, 17 ff)

After Castro's victory, he went to Havana, met Pedro Diaz Lanz, who

was Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Air Force,

and he became the

Director of Security for the Air Force (p 29, 1 13 ff).

He set up an intelligence operation in the USA for Castro (p 30, 1 9 ff),

and then gave the names of the agents to the American government

(p 30, 1 22 ff).

He provided names of the agents, and details of various conspiracies

in Central America, to Col. Nichols, the American military attache

to the Cuban Air Force. (p 31, 18 ff).

He suspected the Embassy and CIA were assisting and advising Castro,

so early in 1959 he went to Washington D.C. and provided the same

information to the FBI (pp 32,33)

His function was just providing intelligence to the CIA and suggesting

possible recruits -- including William Morgan (pp 39-40) .

He recruited Marita Lorenz to spy for him (p 24, 11 6-77)

He was involved in three "serious" plots to kill Castro (p 43, 1 14-20)

His trip to the FBI bypassing the embassy,

to name the communists,

was at the direction of Pedro and Marcos Diaz Lanz (p 46, 1 14 ff).

He did not kill Castro because Col. Nichols would not give him the

"green light" (p 47, 1 23 ff).

STURGIS DEPO - P. 2

He left Cuba on 6/30/59, after Sangenis to told him to leave since

Raul Castro suspected he was working with American Intelligence

(p 48, 1 23 ff).

He believes he and Pedro Diaz Lanz were betrayed by the CIA Chief

of Station at the American embassy (p 50, 114 ff).

Sturgis and the Diaz Lanz brothers were using the B-25, which was

taken from Cuba and registered in Sturgis! name (p 56, 1 9 ff)

CIA money was received from Howard Hunt, through Barker, to fit up

the plane tó broadcast propaganda (p 57, 1 11 ff).

On 10/21/59 Sturgis, the Diaz Lanz brothers, and another Cuban flew

over Havana dropping leaflets from the B-25. Cuban gunfire at the

plane killed or wounded over 30 people. Castro was mad. (p 59, 1 8 ff)

Sangenis (code name, "Sam Jenis") was the head of Operation 40 (p 66, 12 ff)

Operation 40 was the CIA-sponsored intelligence arm of the anti-

Castro operations (p 67, 17 ff).

When Alex Rorke disappeared on a mission to Central America, Sturgis

immediately contacted Naval Intelligence for assistance (p 69, 1 15 ff)

He assumed the quickest action would come from ONI (p 71, 12 ff)

They raised funds from various private sources, including Bacardi Rum

Co. and Dr. Luis Conte Aguerro (p 72, 1 3 ff).

After WW II, Sturgis was operations officer for the CAP in Norfolk,

Virginia (p 74, 114 ff)

Sturgis did over 100 missions into Cuba -- mostly by plane, some

by boat (p 75, 1.4 ff)

The average cost of each mission was $5,000 (p 76, 17 ff)

The CIA Chief of Station in Havana was William Caldwell (p 78, 1 19)

Although Sturgis "never met him personally"

Bernard Barker's first

control officer was "Eduardo" (p 80, 1 2 ff)

First time Sturgis met Hunt was in 1972 (p 81, 1 18 ff)

He formed the International Anticommunist Brigade in the early '60s,

then Jim Buchanan took it over (p 84, 1 1 ff)

He probably knew Loran Hall as part of the Hemming group -- but not

Lawrence Howard (p 85, 1 1 ff)

STURGIS DEPO - P. 3

He didn't know William, Seymour (p 86, 1 22 ff)

Jim Buchanan can verify Sturgis was in Miami on 11/22/63 (p 87, 1 20)

The International Anticommunist Brigade had no funding, and was

completely broke (p 88, 15 ff)

On one occasion, Bernard Barker, known to Sturgis to be a CIA agent,.

asked him to do a domestic assassination.

Sturgis told Sangenis.

Sturgis asked Barker for the name of the victim, and requested to

talk to his control officer about it. The matter was dropped.

(pp 90-93)

On one occasion, he worked on an assassination attempt with Marita

Lorenz against Castro, with poison (pp 93-94)

Upon returning to the United States, he has been involved in two or

three plans or attempts to kill Castro. Orlando Bosch was involved

(pp 95-97)

He became a supervisor and inspector of casinos for the Castro

government (pp 99-102)

On instructions from Castro, he closed down the casinos for ten

days (pp 102-105) He advised Santo Trafficante and Hymie Levine

of this action in advance (p 104)

On one occasion, in Santiago, Cuba, he noticed a group of Barbudos

surrounding Stretch Rubin and threatening to harm him, since he was

"gangster"

• Sturgis "saved" him. (pp 106-108)

Later, Rubin brought Hymie Levine to introduce him to Sturgis, since

it was

unusual to meet an American officer in the Air Force.

On that

occasion, Fidel came in in his helicopter and walked up and embraced

Sturgis. This impressed them. (pp 108-709)

When Castro made Sturgis casino inspector, Levine and Rubin introduced

him to various operators, including Trafficante, Mike McClaney and

Norman Rothman (pp 109-112)

He met Dominic Bartone when he was trying to sell a plane to the Cubans,

and, possibly on one other occasion, but had no connections with him

(pp 113-714)

He also met Charles Tourine while inspecting casinos (p 116)

He never met Marcello, Giancana, or Roselli (p 118)

If he feels a need to contact the CIA, he does it through Steve

Czukas -- a Customs investigator (p 124)

STURGIS DEPO - P. 4

In the early 1960's he went with. Marcos Diaz Lanz to speak with

President Ydigoras of Guatemala regarding the setting up of anti-

Castro bases there. Upon returning to Miami, he was arrested by.

INS, taken to court, and advised that he had

lost his citizenship.

He appealed to Senator Smathers and, somehow, got it back (pp 126-131)

At the time of the deposition, Sturgis claimed to be a news reporter

for "El Expresso" (p 133)

He met Ruben Miro in Havana and, later, found out he was supposedly

involved in the assassination of Panamanian President Ramon (p 135-136)

From the time he went to Cuba in 1956, until he left in June 1959,

he traveled on behalf of the rebels and ensuing government to Florida,.

Mexico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras, The Bahamas,

New York, and Washington. The was to maintain contact with the

underground organization (p 137)

After returning from Cuba, along with the Diaz Lanz brothers, he supported

himself out of the exile community by organizing and planning raids.

Funds came from many sources, including Bosch of Bacardi Rum (pp 139-141)

With the Diaz Lanz brothers, in September, 1961, he formed the Hampton

Roads Salvage Co.

They purchased boats for use on Cuban operations.

Though the CIA "had use of these boats"

, he steadfastly maintains that

all funds were obtained from the Cuban community -- not the CIA

(pp 147-144)

From 1963 through Watergate, he had a varied employment history (pp 146-149)

On 11/21/63 and 11/22/63 he was in Miami, and has "passed" a polygraph

to that effect (pp 152-156)

Marita Lorenz' story is absolutely untrue (pp 157-159)

Over the years he has provided information to various news reporters

: (pp 159-165)

Sturgis has studied and "investigated" the assassination over the years

and believes Oswald was working for Cuban Intelligence (pp 166-170)

He does not recall ever meeting Mitch Werbell, Bernardo de Torres, or

Doug Gupton (pp 172-173) -- or David Phillips

There was a rumor that Oswald had been in the Miami area, but nobody

could ever substantiate it (pp 178-180)

He formed a "church" to help the poor people in South America (pp 183-185)

(pp 186-187)

He has no objections. They've asked if they could

be in attendance at this. I thought that I would ask,

if it is permissible.

The Witness. I would like to correct my Attorney.

I'm soIry to do this to you. They're not my friends

because the press is not my friends.

MI. Rubin.

Personal acquaintances.

Mr. Triplett.

We full understand that.

Mr. Sturgis, it has been the custom and the:

habit of this committee to conduct closed hearings.

And for that reason, I would point out to you that

it is not within the purview of this committee to

conduct open hearings at this time, and the press

would be excluded.

The Witness. Well, one reason why I suggested

that to my Attorney is to show that - to give me

some credibility that I'm openly and honestly, even

in the past, where it pertains to the United States

Government, I have nothing to hide naturally. And

that's one of the reasons why my Attorney and myself

asked that question.

MI. Triplett. We understand that. However, just

for the orderly conduct of

the hearings we prefer to

have the press excluded at this time.

Now as you are aware this proceeding is being

I was born, signed my name and knew my name as

But when I joined the Raider Battalion, we

were trained specifically to do behind the lines

activities. For instances, assassinations, infiltrating

enemy encampments.

These are the types that we did

because we were such a small outfit.

We, only had

500 and sone men in the batallion at a particular time,

and most of our activities were done by submarines

and destroyers, First world war destroyers Because

we were losing the war, so we had to operate benina

the enemy lines.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

Where did you receive this raider training?

The Witness.

on American Samoa. And the

7000

training continually, naturally, as we went from

operation to operation. It was continuous training

out in the Pacific.

MI. Triplett. What type of discharge did you

receive from the Marines?

The Witness. Honorable discharge.

MI. Triplett. What did you do after you were

discharged from the Marines as far as

an occupation?

The Witness. I came home and because of the

influence of my family, the Fiorini family in

Norfolk, Virginia, I got on the Norfolk Police

Department. I spent -- not at the beginning -- but

I was a plain clothes police officer.. I did go

through training that we had which they called the

Police Academy training.

And from then I was working as manager of several

bars there in Norfolk, Virginia.

Mr. Triplett. Did you subsequently enter the

military service, any other military service?

The Witness. Yes. I was in the United States

Naval Air Reserve, stationed at Norfolk Naval Air

Station as a Radio Gunner there. And eventually I

did receive an honorable discharge.

Mr. Triplett. When did you enter the Naval

Reserve?

The Witness.

Oh, that was, I would say after

I got off the Police Department. I would think it

might have been in '46 or '47. I'm not too sure of

Naval Air Station.

Mr. Triplett. What was your function as a

radio gunner?

The Witness:

Well, we took our training with

the PBY's. We learned radio. And weapons was no

problem because I had my basic training with the

Marines as far as weapons were concerned.

Mr. Triplett. And did you receive any special

training in the Naval Reserve?

The Witness. No, sir. I was already prior

trained.

Mr. Triplett. What rank did you attain in the

Naval Reserve?

The Witness.

Seaman, or whatever.

Mr. Triplett. Again, approximately when did

you enlist in the Naval Reserve and when were you

discharged?

The Witness.

Honest, it's a complete blank.

You'd have to check with them, you know, the military

records.

Honorable discharge.

MI. Triplett. Did you subsequently enlist in

Mr. Triplett:

And what kind of training, if

any,

did you receive in the Merchant Marines?

The Witness. Actually no training at

all.

Because

I did join the union. In order to get in the Merchant

And through them I naturally received certain jobs

on Merchant ships.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

In line with those jobs, did you have occasion

to travel?

The Witness. Yes, sir.

MI. Triplett. And do you recall, of can you

list some of the ports you traveled to during that

period?

The Witness.

Well, I'll give you one in particular.

I went to theone up in Greenland, which was one of our

biggest air bases that we had, about 200 miles this

side of the North Pole. I'm trying to remember, the

name of it. I forget the name of it, but it's one

of our biggest bases we had, military bases we had

in Greenland.

Mr. Triplett. And did you have occasion to

travel back and forth between this country and Europe

in the Merchant Marine?

The Witness. Yes.

Mr. Triplett. Approximately how long were

you in the Merchant Marine?

The Witness, Not too long. I'd say possibly

Ms. Triplett. And what was your reason for

leaving the Merchant Marine?

The Witness. The situation, international

situation with the United States Government as far

as shipping was concerned, was getting very bad.

were doing it more with foreign carriers than they

They

were with American carriers, and naturally American

unions were a little upset with that. So I could

not make a living really, by staying with the Merchant

Marine.

Mr. Triplett. I see.

And after you left the Merchant Marine, what

did you do as far as an occupation is concerned?

The Witness. Well, I had a night club that

I was involved with called the Top Hat Night Club

on Virginia Beach, Virginia. I also was part owner

in that. Mr. Arthur Bass was my patron and also my

partner. I had a bar on Main Street in Norfolk called

the -- I was part owner in that. It's been so many

«years ago.

Anyway, before I went with him to the night club

I was part owner at this bar and then when we sold

the bar that's when I started to

go to the Merchant

Marine thing.

And one of the reasons why I quit the Merchant

Marine was because he convinced me to go into the

business of the night club. Now it's coming back.

Mr. Arthur Bass.

So I went into the night club business with him.

This was another reason why I discontinued going with

the Merchant Marine.

Mr. Triplett. And how long were you in the night

club business with Mr. Bass?

The Witness. I imagine a good couple of years.

Mr. Triplett. And following that, did you

subsequently enlist in the United States Army?

The Witness. Yes, I aid.

Mr. Triplett. Approximately when, if you recall,

did you enlist in the United States Army?

The Witness. I imagine It would be in the '50's.

This was at the time of the Russian blockade of Berlin.

When I joined the Army, I signed up in Norfolk,

Virginia. I believe it was Norfolk, Virginia.el

went to fort Dix, New Jersey. I passed my OCS test

and they were

going to send me to officer Candidate

School, and I asked if they had one in Europe and

they said yes, they did. And they lied to me.

So when I went to Europe"I found out that the

Army lied to me and they did not have an Officer

Candidate School there. That I would have to stay in,

and go to the Officer Candidate School back

So I immediately asked to go overseas and a few

weeks later -- I did not have to get training because

ofmy prior training and because of my combat experience,

I was sent to, I believe it was Marburg (phonetic),

Germany, which was a repo depot there,

outfit there, where they sent me to Berlin, Germany,

and I was with the Fourth Regiment there, and I was

with General Clay's Honor Guard.

What was your purpose in asking

Mr. Triplett.

Well, Officer Candidate School

was available here, but you said you wanted to go to

ocs In Europe. What was your purpose in wanting to

go to Europe?

The Witness. Well, I wanted to go back to Europe

because I had been to Europe before and I liked

Europe. And I felt well, I'd prefer to go to Europe

and I was having problems with my first wife at that

time and I just wanted to get away from the United

States

Oh, when I left Berlin, Germany, I was having

a very close affair with a young lady there who happened

to be going with a Colonel on General Clay's Staff,

so I was immediately sent out of Berlin back to Marburg,

which in turn they sent me to Heidleburg, Germany,

which was headquarters, UCOM Headquarters, and I was

assigned to Armed Security Agency, which I had the

clearance for.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

Besides Marburg, Heidleburg and Berlin, were

you stationed in any other places in Europe?

places in Europe, but these were the places that I

was actually stationed.

Mr. Triplett. Now will you again describe, you

say you had security clearance at Heidleburg?

training, was not necessary because of my past military

training, but specialized training. For instance

like Army Security Agency. As you went along you

received that particular type of training.

Well, I was in the mountains in

Cuba with Fidel Castro. My first contact with any

was with the Vice-Consul in Santiago, Cuba. One

of my missions when I came out of the mountains was

to deliver some secret messages to the underground

in Santiago.

When I was in Santiago I always went to the

Casa Grande Hotel, which was the biggest hotel there.

and one evening, which was on a Friday, I sat down

to play bingo, and an American came to my table and made

contact with me and was playing bingo, and he identified

himself as we went along in a few hours, he told me

was, the

Vice-Consul. Also, he was the Chief of the

CIA stationed there in Santiago.

And he questioned me and so forth.

This is where

I first started to spy on Castron forces for the

Mr Triplett. Okay

While you were gathering this information

presumably in 1958, were you paid for these services?

The Witness. I was offered money, but I refused

it and the reason why I refused it was the fact

that

I felt that in helping my country at that particular

time, I had my own resources which was

with Castro.

Money was no problem,

so I didn't feel that I needed

to take money from my own Government who I voluntarily.

when he asked, to go ahead and spy for the United

Mr. Triplett. So you rejected any money at

that time?

Well, my connection with the -

I got involved in the Cuban -

The Witness

Yeah.

Mr. Triplett. Would that be before you went

into the. Army?

The Witness. Yeah. The first contact with the

Cuban exile people.

Then I met Cardos Prio, the ex-President of

Cuba and I had an association with him.

As time went

on, I believe it was, it might have been 156, or 157,

as time went on I tried to convince President Carlos

Prio that the people, his gorilla force in the

mountains of Cuba was not very active. That I felt

that it might be a good idea for me to go there to

helpin the training of the gorillas and to

step up

the military actions there.

He agreed, but that wasn't the question.

The

question that he needed was naturally the arms that

the gorilla forces needed to fight against the Batista

so it was

decided that I would go and join

This was a decision between you and Carlos Prio?

touch with certain people in the Church there who

took me personally - I'm sorry, they didn't take

me personally a they told me to go to Motonzos.

a To

go to the Catholic Church there, which I made contact

with a priest there who took me out in the countryside

to meet a Cuban fellow who was the manager of the

Coca Cola plant there in Montonzo. And I stayed at

his place where he took me to a farm house this side

of the mountains where I waited for a Cuban patrol.

across Fidel. I forget the name of the small -- in

the mountains - a small conglomerate of houses that

were

along the mountain side and this is

where I

met Fidel again. Because remember, I met Fidel in

Miami, Florida before he went to Cuba.

MI. Triplett. All right.

Once you met Fidel, I presume you joined

up

with him, or stayed with him?

The Witness.

Well, not exactly joined with

him because my sympathies were with the Cuban exiles

against the Dictator Batista.

It was decided later with prio that I would

go ahead and join Fidel's group of people.

And prior to Fidel taking over

and throwing out Batista, what functions did you

perform for Mr. Castro?

Certainly it was clandestine.

the Central American countries and these Caribbean

things which again the American Government was being

advised through me.

Mr. Triplett. Were any Castro agents arrested

as a result of this information you were giving the

American Government?

The Witness. No, sir, and I'll tell you the

reason why. Because I didn't find out until years

later that through many of the meetings that we had

had in Havana at the very beginning, many of us

suspected that the American Embassy was helping in

guiding Fidel Castro, especially CIA.

At one of the meetings I was asked to bypass

*the Embassy and go directly to Washington, D.C. to

make contact with Mr. Hoover because being that we

were strongly anti-communist and because of the

information that many of our people had and the

contacts that they had pertaining to the Embassy,

had the sympathies of many of the Embassy personnel

and also of the CIA personnel assisting Castro which.

at that time, we didn't know this definitely.

But

we suspected it. Later we found it was a true fact.

So I did bypass with information pertaining to

the Castro brothers and pertaining to many of the

Communists who were being put in various positions by

So I went on a special mission to Washington.

No, sir, I don!t. But it shoula

But later on Pedro Diez

and Marcus Diez Lanz

themselves had, either one of them had contact,

personal contact with Mr. Hoover.

Mr. Triplett. Now when was this you went to

Washington?

The Witness. Oh, gee, I'm not sure whether

it was rebruary of

1959 or not. I'm not sure.

Januaty, February of March. One of those three months.

But I'm sure it was immediately in February

Mr. Triplett. And still at this time you were

The Witness. Right.. At the same time working

with the Embassy and trying to go ahead and find out

who you could trust and who you couldn't trust.

But that particular time when I went to Washington,

nobody at the Embassy knew that I went directly to

Washington.

Mr. Triplett. Now when you say you were working

for the Embassy, who precisely at that time were you

working with?

The Witness. Well let me say I had an

association.

I'm sorry, because sometimes I get overt.

My association with the Embassy was through Colonel

Nichols who was the military attache, at the Embassy

Mr. Triplett. And was there anybody else also?

The Witness. I beg your pardon?

Mr. Triplett. Was there anybody else you

were associating with in your capacity?

The Witness.

The only one I had contact with

was Colonel Nichols.

Mr. Triplett. All right.

The Witness: I went to the Embassy several

times,

A document, which I'm sure Pedro of Märcus

Diez Lanz has, in order to cover my association with

the Embassy, named me -- I forget how it is again

So in case the Cuban

had a document that it was an official visit because

of the Air Force and the American Air Force mission

that was there at the time.

Clark Wollen?

Well, Clark Wollen was down in

Santiago. When I left Santiago, that was it.

don't believe my contact was with wollen. I believe

intelligence gathering activity?

The Witness. Yes, sir.

Mr. Triplett. And what would be the correct

designation? Recruiting? Enlisting support? Asking

for help? How would you describe it?

The Witness. Well, I would describe it as

making contact with people within the Cuban military.

was there.

Naturally my friends Pedro and Marcus Diez Lanz

Major Van Horne in the American Embassy.

As a matter of fact this woman here had a close

contact with me when she was working in Havana. we

had the Brickell House here on Brickell Avenue that

the MRR was using. We all gathered there. She had

a smali apartment in the back of the Brickell House,

a safe house.

And she was traveling back and forth

to Havana. And she was later arrested and given a

ten year sentence for spying. Served three and a

half years in Guandhi (Phonetic) prison, came over

to the United States.

I went along I found out that CIA did help Fidel, guide

about the Communist infiltration and what was going

conspiracies going on to kill Fidel and I was

because a Jimmy, Gentry (phonetic), who was very close

he would kill Pedro because Pedro was very anti-

communist, and he pulled his gun on me and I in turn

took his .45 away from him and marched him to the

Air Force office of Pedro.

And naturally I ran him

off the base.

So there was friction there against

Raul Castro. But Fidel was more diplomatic and

against us, many of the military commanders who helped

him, who was in high positions, so Fidel had to go

ahead and smooth things over.

But he knew who was

against him.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

On how many occasions were you aware of -- well,

On how many occasions were you involved in plans

Or attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro?

The Witness. Well, I would say - well, there

were numerous plots that I was involved in. And I

would say the most serious plots -- I'm talking about

the real serious ones that I was involved in -- was

about three.

two,

I was told, well okay, unless we get the word

from Washington, don't do anything. But at the same

time I had meetings with military commanders who

wanted to kill him.

commanders, or American?

who wanted to kill Fidel and who were

her, in february. So it might have been in March

because I had to get, you know, I don't just come

out when I just meet her you know, I

had to gain

Because it was a very ticklish

relation to that date, when did you first become

disenchanted with Fidel Castro and when did you first

have a suspicion that he was a Communist?

The Witness. All of us --I'm talking about

my friends like Commander Ricardo Lauria (phonetic),

Commander. Hubamartis (phonetic), Commander Pedro

Diez Lanz, Commander Marcus Diez Lanz, myself

and

other commanders, had various meetings all over

Havana secretly. And I would say that by the time

of February, 1959, it was definitely decided, because

of all the activities that was going on with the

various top Communist people, that Raul was trying

to get into the military. And so far he couldn't

get them into the Air Force because I was running

them off

you see? But we suspected and damn well

knew that Fidel was a Communist and working with

the Communist Party,

Also by february we suspected that CIA was

guiding Fidel also in this thing.

This is why I was sent -- it might have been

would be the reason for the failure of any attempts

on Fidel Castro's life at that time?

The Witness. Well, I would say that the

individual persons that were being used in order to

go ahead and kill him.

I was in the best position in

the world to go ahead and really kill him, if I was

in charge of killing Fidel. I was in the best

position because I could have stopped him right at

that gate there. Every time Fidel would come in, he

would come in in a convoy. I would stop the convoy

because I was out there one day when I was inspecting

and I could have killed everybody. Because I had

people and I trained people, you know, to check the

roofs, the main street, the main entrance of the Air

Force Base. We checked the roofs out, and I could

have had machine gunners up there with hand grenades

That pro Communist bastard son-of-a-bitch. I dislike

these people very much for what they did to us in

Cuba and which they continued to do in the Bay of

Pigs invasion. They're the same people that got

involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion and betrayed us

again, you know, which cost people's lives. And oh,

my mind sometimes gets screwed up. But where were we

anyway?

Mr. Triplett. I was asking you if you knew

who specifically, but apparently you don't have a

name at the moment. Let's move along now.

Once you returned to the United States -

The Witness. (Interposing) That was June the

30th, yeah.

Mr. Triplett. Were you contacted by any

representative of the CIA or the Federal Government

for a debriefing of anything of that nature?

The Witness.

No,

six. No, sir.

Mr. Triplett. After you left Cuba, did anybody

approach you to perform services or gather information

on behalf of the CIA?

The Witness. After I left Cuba?

Mr. Triplett. Yes.

The witness.

No, sir.

well, let me tell you what happened there. I

had to arrange the escape of Pedro Diez Lanz because

of the Embassy because they refused him aslyum, which

I resented bitterly. Marcus Diez Lanz also. All right.

Meantime, at that time we thought CIA was still

all right, but we had our suspicions within the

Embassy.

Marcus Diez Lanz was helped by CIA later to get

out.

This was, I would say, a month later.

But when

I came over on June the 30th, I took two aircraft from

Cuba over here. One was a C-46D, that was in my name,

and a B-25 bomber that was in my name. Okay?

NOW,

so I had to arrange to get those airplanes

over here before I defected. I had meetings over there

with Pedro and so. forth and I wanted to cause an

uprising there. I said look, I have command of

1,000 troops here at the Air Force Base... Let's get

hold of President Arukia (phonetic). I'll put 500

men around the Capital, the Presidential Palace, if

President Arukia will denounce Castro, you know,

and

the Communists.

President Arukia said no. That Castro was

misguided and said no.

Well, he was saving his own

ass is what he was doing.

But also I wanted

to go ahead and destroy much

Because I asked Pedro, send

our pilots up in the air, get every airplane we can

up in the air, get all our troops that we can, put

them in the transport planes that we

have, and send

them over to the Isle of Pine. We grab the Isle of

Pine,

We get the Batista prisoners that Fidel had

in the Isle of Pine prison. That would be, the nucleolus

down

Mr. Triplett.

Again, these were the people

at the Embassy that turned it down?

The Witness.

I'm not sure the Embassy was

At least they were not aware of this

particular operation that I wanted to do. They

were not aware through me.

Mr. Triplett. Okay. Getting back to after

you returned to the united States:

To your knowledge, were you ever contacted by

any

representatives of the CIA for any purpose?

The Witness.

Iwas contacted by an official of

to get a boat to go into Cuba and get Pedro out and

get Marcus out and his family.

I was told, Frank, leave it alone. Don't touch

it because arrangements are being made by CIA to get

them out.

Mr. Triplett.

Because I was arranging with Pedro

So what the half brother did with the boat, we

used it, they allowed surgio to go but didn't want me

to go because I was an American and they knew Castro

would catch me.

Then CIA did make arrangements to get Marcus Diez

Lanz out because Marcus was in touch with an agent in

Cuba, a CIA agent. And that agent, if you'd like to

know, who he is, that was Bernard Barker.

Mr. Triplett. All right.

Now after you returned to the United States,

did you have any contact with any Castro Intelligence

Agents?

Here in the United States?

The Witness. No. At least not to my knowledge.

Because some of the people we didn't know. No.

You would assume that Castro, with what people

we knew over here, if they were agents, would change

them around. So no. We kept to ourselves

The reason for that is, remember, we were

Cuban revolutionaries, all right? We helped

overthrow

the Batista Government. So the first group of

refugees that come over here were the Batista people,

or at least the people that were very sympathetic;

which they had reason to leave there because Castro

was shooting everybody, which was wrong on his part.

So naturally when we came here we more or less kept

But as time went by we did start to associate

ourselves with certain, at least not myself, but

Pedro and Marcus, with certain people who were, you

know, of the Batista faction. And then myself later

on.

personally. But before the Bay of Pigs invasion, we

had a special flying group.

Mr. Triplett. When you say we, who?

The Witness.

Pedro Diez Lanz, Marcus Diez Lanz

and myself, using my B-25. Now this is the same --

Mr. Triplett. (Interposing) how about the C-46?

The Witness. Well, that was not used.

We

sold that eventually. That was not used in the Bay

of Pigs.

Mr. Triplett. This was your B-25?

my name.

Registered with the FAA in my name.

Mr. Triplett. Well, whose was it if it wasn't

part of the revolution and being that the other

people were Cuban revolutionaries, they used my

name in order to be on the license.

My name was

used because you couldn't get somebody that wasn't

an American citizen.

Mr. Triplett. Who else was there?

The Witness. Just us.

MI. Triplett. The three of you.

Marcus, Diez

Lanze, Pedro and --

The Witness.

(Interposing) And myself.

Well, the money, before the Bay of pigs invasion,

the monies that went to the repairs of the B-25, was

CIA money.

As a matter of fact I was told later while I

was in prison, by Howard, that Howard Howard Hunt

I'm talking about -- Howard Hunt said he dia give

Barker $10,000 to turn over to pedro to pay the

bills of the B-25:

I think we had an L. B. Smith

over here at 36th Street Airport being repaired.

And one of the things that the B-25 was going

to be used, which we were fixing the airplane up

because we were going to put on the tail of the B-25

a long antennea that would be stretched out while

the aircraft was in flight with tape recordings and

radio equipment in the B-25 to broadcast propaganda

in Cuba while the B-25 was in flight. This was one

of the

operations. And the monies did come from CIA;

for the repairs and the bill to the B-25.

Mr. Triplett. And did you know at that time it

came from the CIA?

The Witness. Certainly. Sure. I didn't know

who it came from because the money came from Barker.

Because i didn't know who Barker's boss was.

You must understand that a week before - this

found out through Howard Hunt while I was in prison

a week before the invasion, Bernard Barker was the

assistant to Howard.

Howard, from what Howard told me, that hel

disagreed with the policies of what was happening,

the change that was happening within, you know, the

groups, the CIA and the Revolutionary Council, because

he was the political officer of the revolutionary

Council. I had no contact with Howard Hunt. I never

knew Howard Hunthat all. I knew there was an Eduardo

and squardo was Barker's boss

But he left the outfit and Barker was turned

over to a new CIA control officer, I believe.

And

Barker would not tell me.

I believe his new boss

was Jim Knowles.

MI. Triplett. And what led you to believe that?

I'm not sure really.

I'11 be

very honest with you, I'm not sure. I'm not sure

whether Howard Hunt told me that Barker's new boss

was Jim Knowles or not. Because you know, sometimes

you don't say things, you know.

I'm not sure:

But

Barker never told me who his new control officer was:

But I believe it was Jim Knowles:

Again, this B-25 was the same B-25 that Pedro

Diez Lanz and myself as pilots and Marcus Diez Lanz

and another Cuban fellow by the name of Itchgoia

(phonetic) flew over on October the 21st of 1959,

over the City of Havana, and dropped several hundred

thousands of leaflets over that City. And several

Cubans, I think maybe 31 or 33 Cuban people

were

killed and wounded on that air raid that we did.

Mr. Triplett. Dropping leaflets?

The Witness. Leaflets, yeah. Well, you see

we were 1,000 foot off the ground over the City and

the gunners from Cabana Fortress and the three B-26

fighter bombers tried to shoot us down and the shells

exploding killed or wounded 31 or 33 people. And

Fidel raised a lot of hell about it.

And as a matter of fact, charges were brought

against Pedro Diez Lanz in Federal Court here about

these things and it was thrown out a half hour later

the B-26 that was ever purchased. And that was in

I think it was the CAA, or whatever.

Because one of my other jobs for Castro at one time,

he wanted me to take charge of the casinos for Pasternita

Nunez, who was in the mountains with me and with Fidel

And if I'm not mistaken, I met Martinez. He was

Cuba. And Nino was

had three different groups that the CIA controlled.

CIA controlled the Revolutionary Council, which was

At the same time I had, naturally, association with

Operation

40, the primary job was intelligence.

In other words once a beach head was made inside

of Cuba, the people to follow the beach head would

be intelligence,

which would be Operation 40, which

already had contact inside Cuba through the CIA

naturally. The Cuban CIA agents would immediately

have direct contact with Operation, 40.

And being an intelligence organization going

into Cuba, in other words, to maintain contact with

the local populace, the political and the military

connections. That both CIA and members of this

whole invasion group, whether it was the Revolutionary

Council or the Brigade or from operation 40 or CIA,

make contact. And it's understandable that you have

an organization like Operation 40 to make contact

with certain people.

If there's any betrayal with

the people you make contact with in Cuba, well

naturally it's logical, in order to fend your

a resistance

movement in exile against the Castro Government:

you have brief meetings with Tony and the rest of

been talking about intelligence, we've been talking

primarily about the CIA:

Did you have any contacts with representatives

of Army Intelligence?

well, it's possible. Again, CIA

draws from all intelligence services, both Naval,

Army: Air Force Intelligence, and takes them away

from their own service and then uses them as CIA

agents.

Okay

To your knowledge, did you provide

any

information or perform any activities on behalf of

Army, Air Force or Naval Intelligence?

The Witness. Yeah.

Jeffrey Sullivan and

Alex Roark.

Mr. Triplett. And to your knowledge, did Naval

Intelligence provide any assistance?

The witness

Yes, they did. They immediately

sent out, I believe, Coast Guard aircraft and I

believe possibly Naval Aix Force. I'm not sure, you

know, what they did, but I know they did go out and

provide the necessary search mission for locating the

aircraft.

Mr. Triplett. And was this because Mr. Roark

was a member of Naval Intelligence, or an associate?

The Witness. I didn't know too much of Alex's

background.

Alex was a friend of mine. Very strongly

anti- communist.

Alex did have an association in the

past with the FBI.

His association, I would say that

he worked for them, not as an informant, but for them.

In what position, I don't know.

Mr. Triplett.

Okay.

What was Your purpose in approaching Naval

Intelligence on his behalf, as opposed to State

Department, Coast Guard, Navy in general Army?

the witness. I'llibe very honest with you.

quick action and I got on the phone and i made the call

Mr. Triplett. It was your assumption that the

quick action would come from Naval Intelligence as

opposed to any other source?

The Witness.

As a matter of fact I did have a meeting with

Alex the day before he left on this mission, on this

trip, at opa locka airport.

Mr. Triplett. You say he was on a mission.

On whose behalf was that mission?

The Witness. I don't know at that particular

time. All I know is, we had the meeting at Opa locka

airport.

He told us he was on his way to Central

America and then he completely disappeared.

Mr. Triplett. Have you had occasion on other

occasions to phone Naval Intelligence and ask for

assistance?

The Witness.,

No.

Mr Triplett.

Or to provide information?

The Witness

No.

Mr.

Triplett. Have you been involved with

organizations that have raised funds privately to

perform anti-Castro activities? Raids, propaganda

or whatever?

The Witness.

The Witness. Personal contact. I will go ahead

people I don't know who they got the funds from

because it was not my position to do that. From

Bacardi Rum Company, which the Vice-Consul, the

Station Chief in Santiago works for the Rum Company

after his retirement.

Mr. Triplett. And as a result of raising this

money, did you personally make any trips into and

out

of Cuba?

DI. Loule Conte Aguerro was being trained and

So this

wasn't privately financed. This was again Government

money?

The Witness. I can not exactly tell you that

he received the money directly from the Government.

But he contacted me at a meeting at the Miami Springs

Villa one time with a whole room full of Cubans there

who knew me, many of them knew me.

One of the

persons that was with him was Oscar Mastre (phonetic).

They owned like GMQ in Cuba, his family. Which these

people naturally had very close CIA connections

and

had their own financing. You've got to understand

a lot;

of these people, they have their own financing.

They would give money and the Government would

reimburse them. So it isn't like it's coming directly

from the Government.

That's how they work. Go through

their fronts.

And they asked me to do a series of air raids

in Cuba, but to drop nothing but leaflets, which I

agreed.

I felt that -- there were five operations

and they asked me what the operations were, how much

money it would cost to do the operations, and I told

them approximately about $5,000 per operation. That

would lease the plane, the pilots involved and so

forth.

And I would obtain the pilots because they

wanted me to stay out of it.

But unfortunately, because some of the pilots

couldn't find their way in the daytime, as well as

at night time, I had to go ahead and do them myself.

Perform the operation myself personally.

Mr. Triplett. By the way, when and where did

you receive your flight training?

The Witness.

In Norfolk, Virginia.

Mr. Triplett. Through the military or privately?

The Witness.

No, sir, privately.

I took it

through the GI Bill of Rights, my pilot training and

so forth, through CAP. I was operations officer for

Government?

The Witness. I would say that I myself personally

did not receive the money directly from the Government.

It was done through other people, which other people

got me to do it. For instance, DI. Louie Conte

Aguerro:

He directly said, "Frank, what's the

operation cost? Here's the money." And I got it.

Mr. Triplett. And what was the average cost

412%

of

each operation?

The Witness. About $5,000. $5,000 period.

MI. Triplett..

And that -- did that include

money or reimbursement for you and the other people

involved to support your families?

The Witness.

No. That was money for the

particular operation.

MI. Triplett. Well like you say, flying in

and out of cuba, one flight, dropping leaflets, would

have cost $5,000?

The Witness. Right. Sure. You've got an

aircraft. You've

got to pay the pilots. You had

to

give the pilots like $1,500 each to do this mission.

This was a mission that was a naturally dangerous

mission.

Yes, as a matter of fact Alex went on several

of these missions with me, taking pictures of the

a couple of names that he couldn't recall this

Either going out to the Ranch House which was

on, close to 36th Street near LeJuene Road. There

used to be a Ranch House there.

one naturally, I believe it was Jim Knowles, and I

Mr. Triplett. You had never personally met

Eduardo?

The Witness.

No. We'd all heard in the Cuban

colony of Eduardo because he was political!

Belonged

to the political sector of CIA. And I had nothing

be done with the Cuban Revolutionary Council:

Mr. Triplett. All right.

What was your role with respect to the

International Anti-Communist Brigade?

The Witness: Well, going back, understand,

my role was at one time this was a

group that I formed

which were one of many many groups that was formed

in the Miami area. I'm talking about Cuban groups

who were anti-Castro groups.

And Jerry Patrick Heming (phonetic) had a group

of Americans from the United States or from Canada

in the area, that these boys were associated with.

Rolando Masferer. Who else was involvea?

understand that Rolando Masferer was a Senator in

Cuba who, under the Batista regime, had a terrible

name for torture and killing and so forth

Mr. Triplett. His nickname was El Tigere

wasn't it?

But he was in exile, And we more or less

I say we, I talk about people like the Diez lanz

Imagine, in the early '60's, the Brigade

was formed.

And then I gave up with it really.

And then the

person who took over the Brigade was Bucanhan, Jim

Who was a newspaper man from

the Sun Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale.

Mr. Triplett. Well, did you form it all on

your own, or were other people involved in the

formation?

I had, I think, Ray, Sanstrom take care of the

legal aspects of it and any letters or correspondence

that would come in would go to his office, and so forth,

it.

I never really, and truthfully never thought that I

had met this man, nor did I know this man.

But as I came out, people like Jerry Patrick

reminded me well, he was with my group and this and

that and you met him and so forth. And then there

was somethings that I read in various books that

Loren Hall dia leave the Miami area, did go out

there and wanted to raise money for the Brigade and

so forth,

and then I recollected that probably he

was one of the persons that I did know here that was

with the Jerry Patrick group.

Mr. Triplett.

I don't think so. Hall is more,

that I met through Jerry Patrick. There was a

A parachute school or group. And they had been

associated or involved with various other Cuban

organizations to try to get tied up with, and it all

boiled down

to one thing. The money. Who had the

money to do operations, who didn't have the money.

Mr. Triplett. Was Howard Davis connected with

the CIA?

As a matter of fact I don't know, at that particular

time.

a number of Americans with him and i didn't personally

that Iaid recall and some I didn't recall.

Mr. Triplett. Well, at that time Jerry Patrick

also formed a group called Interpen, or Intercontinental

Penetration Force?

The Witness. Right.

Mr. Triplett. Was that a subsidiary of your

group or

or were they more or less in tandum, or what

was the relationship?

The Witness. I don't think there was any

relationship because they went off and did their own

thing, really. You know, after that they did their

own thing.

And I personally, like I say, I don't recall

when Bucanhan decided well. go ahead and use the

Brigade, because I didn't care at that particular

So I disassociated myself, you know, with them.

his group. They were uncontrolable.

Mr. Triplett. Was it a corporation? You mentioned

Mr

Sanstrom was involved in it.

The Witness.

It's very easy to find out.

think possibly it was formed as a corporation to try

to arrange money legally.

And like I said before,

there was no money to be raised.

Mr. Triplett. Okay•

if it was a corporation or even if it was a

partnership, it would require more than one person

as the organizer.

Who else organized it with you?

Whose names were on it?

The Witness. To be honest with you, my mind

is blank on that.

If it was a corporation and

legally incorporated, Tallahassee would have the

papers and the people's names on it.

Mr. Triplett. How long were you with the

organization before you turned it over to Bucanhan?

The Witness

Well I didn't exactly turn it

over.

I just let it ride and told Bucanhan, oh,

forget it.

So he more or less started it up himself

The Witness. No. Not that long. The Brigade,

it may have been a year possibly, that I wanted to

go ahead and be involved with it. But like I say,

I just lost interest in the whole thing because of

a lack of funding.

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever been contacted by

any person for the purpose of killing somebody in

this country?

The Witness. Yes, sir.

Mr. Triplett.. By whom?

The Witness. At that time, a CIA agent.

Mr. Triplett.

And who was the agent?

The Witness. Do I have to tell you? weil, I've

got nothing to hide.

I'm sorry I even said that.

The year, I don't recall the year, but I don't

know whether I called this party or the party called

me. Anyway we

got together and in getting

together,

I,was either asked at his home or at a restaurant,

whether I would be interested in doing a domestic

assassination. And that surprised me.

Mr. Triplett. Who was this person?

The Witness. Barker.

Mr. Triplett. And approximately when?

you recall?

The Witness. No. I don't recall.

Mr. Triplett. Can you put it in a frame of

reference, after you returned from Cuba? Before

or after the Bay of Pigs?

The Witness. This is the problem.

It was after

I came from Cuba, I don't recall what year. Whether

It was

before or after the Bay of Pigs. I honestly

don't recall.

I did tell Sam Jenis about this and he kind of

laughed and he said really, you've got to be kidding.

well, find out.

So, I pursued it. I told Barker I said yes, I

would do it, a domestic assassination.

But first I've

got to find out who the person is.

Then he started

questioning me, well how would you go about it and

so forth. And I said hey, you know, it all depends

on who the party is.

So we went from there and I had a couple of

meetings with him pertaining to that. Then finally

I was told to pin him down and say hey, I will not

do it unless I get word from his control office. And

that's what I did. I said, until your control officer

sits down with me and tells me that he wants a domestic

assassination done, then I would do it. But through

you, not Iwant another verification from your

control

officer.

He never came back.

Mr.

Triplett.

Did he ever talk to his control

officer?

The Witness. Evidently he must have, because

he never mentioned it after that particular incident.

And I'd been in touch with him up until the day of

Watergate, our problems with Watergate. And he never

came back and told me whether

or not he wanted me to

go ahead and continue, you know, whatever the domestic

assassination was. Because I said I want to know who

the party is, depending on how I would do it.

If it's

going to be domestic, it's pretty hot stuff, you know.

So I told Barker, well, go to the Everglades,

you dig a hole, put lye in there and bury the guy

or welll get an airplane or boat and do it out here

in the Gulf, you know, blow the boat up and so forth

But I said before I actually do it, I-want your

control officer to sit down with me and I want it

from his mouth that this is national security business.

And I would want to know who the party is, depending

on how I would do this particular operation, you know.

killed?

The witness. I don't know. He never told me.

any facilities for the purpose of doing this?

The Witness.

No... It never got to that point.

In other words, after I told him, you know, that I

would have to

sit down with his control officer, the

thing never developed into anything else.

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever been contacted by

anyone else, or by Mr. Barker, for the purpose of

killing anybody else domestically?

Mr. Triplett. Only that one time?

Yes s

Just that one time

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever been contacted by

anybody for the purpose of killing somebody outside

The Witness: Since I came from Cuba?

NO.

Mr. Triplett. Specifically Fidel Castro?

The Witness.

Oh, with Fidel, yes.

Yes

Mr. Triplett. Well, that's killing somebody.

I'm sorry.

I'm awfully sorry.

Mr. Triplett. Just one occasion, or more than

one occasion?

The Witness. One occasion. That's poison.

MI. Triplett. And again, who contacted you

for that purpose?

The Witness. For that particular purpose who

contacted me to go ahead and set this thing up? No

one at all. Just the Cuban groups, you know, here

ourselves, trying to go ahead and do penetration work

inside of Cuba. We were going to try to kill Fidel

naturally.

Mr. Triplett. So it was a joint decision of

which you were a part?

The Witness. A joint decision.

Mr. Triplett. Well, whose idea was it?

The Witness. Yeah, it was a joint decision to

go ahead and try to kill Castro naturally. Which

continues until this day. The only exception is

that I'm not involved today and haven't been for the

last number of years to do

anything like that against

CastIo.

The Witness.

How many times? Well, going,

back many years ago, I would think that after the

Bay of Pigs invasion, maybe shortly after that, I

more or less lost interest because of not having.

the proper financing.

In order to do that you have

to have proper financing, to kill fidel.

I'd say, the Bay of Pigs failed, and I may

have tried after 1963 because of the President's

assassination, because I was very bitter about that.

And I felt, from as early 1964, that the

President was assassinated, that Castro's intelligence

service was one of others that was behind the killing

of the Presidents.And naturally my feeling was

continuous revenge against the friends that he

executed and would be feeling that he was involved

in the killing of the President.

Mr Triplett.

so how many times did you attempt,

oF plan to kill Castro?

The Witness. Oh, I would say about, not counting

the Marita Lorenz thing at the very beginning, I would

say here in the United States, probably about two

times, two or three times, approximately.

Mr. Triplett. And who else was involved with

you on these two or three occasions?

The Witness.

Myself and a number of Cuban groups

The Witness. Well, individual people who had

their own groups.

Mr. Triplett. Who were these individual

people? I want their names.

Oh? Well, that's pretty tough

because of the years that went by and the connections

that we have had.

How about Orlando Bosch?

Orlando Bosch, yes.

Mr. Triplett. Did you ever discuss the

assassination of Fidel Castro or plan the

assassination of Fidel Castro with any official

of the United States Government?

No, sir:

recall me discussing anything about killing Fidel

with any FBI agents.

Mr. Triplett.

never did?

that I've been involved in so many things in the

past years that I could not say, you know, yes or

no.

You know, straight out.

Mr. Triplett. Have you ever planned, or been

assassinating somebody outside this country other

than Fidel Castro?

NO.

Mr. Triplett. Like maybe a Centräl or South

American President or Dictator, or Raul Castro?

and naturally there are always conspiracies going

really nail these people:

Mt. Triplett. I'm talkingaabout you

specifically?

The witness.

Myself specifically? Well,' I

have heard through my associations with various

Cubans in the past of wanting

to go ahead and try

to, you know, kill them on certain visits that they

had taken from Cuba to certain other countries. But

for myself specifically to be involved in trying to

do it, I don't recall that me myself did any planning

stage, you know, trying to kill Castro.

And to be honest with you, if, there was a plan

to do it, I would certainly get myself involved because

I hate the man.

I would have no hesttation.

Mr. Triplett.

In other words you're not

adverse to that sort f plan? Even today? Is that

what you're saying?

The Witness. Well, let me say this. I won't

say that because I'm much older today Much older

and much wiser and you can't buck the system.

And

if Uncle Sam says don't touch the man, well then you

don't touch the man. So I don't touch him.

Mr. Triplett.

the casinos

or the casino owners?

The Witness. I believe at one of the Staff

meetings that I had with Castro, it was either at

the Air Force Base or the Prime Minister's office,

and it might have been as early as February, Castro

wanted me to help Pasternita Nunez, who was a woman

that was in the mountains with me, or I was with them

in the mountains. She was a minister and all this

control came under her.

So Fidel wanted me to help

her because of the confusion in Government that was

going on as early as February.

So I, representing the Cuban Government, assisted

Pasternita in the, well say control for the Government,

of the casinos

I believe there was approximately,

maybe 22 casinos at that particular time

My job was, for Castro, to make sure, as he

was changing everything around, to make sure that

only a set amount of tables in each casino would be

operational and that each one of these tables had

to have the Government tax stamp on the tables. And

my job was to make sure that for instance, the Havana

Hilton was a big room there and they had X amount

of tables, roulette, black jack, this, that and so

forth, that they would have to have each table with

a tax stamp, and my job was to make sure that that was

Mr. Triplett. And this was at the same time

that you were with the Air Force in Cuba?

The Witness. Yeah. Right.

I. Triplett. Had you, previous to that time,

ever worked in any of the casinos?

The Witness. I have never worked, nor have I

owned any gambling casinos in my whole life.

Mr. Triplett. Had you ever worked for any

of the people who owned casinos at that time?

The Witness. No. Never in my whole life.

NO

None whatsoever. The only contact I ever had with

either casino operators or the management is when I

would go on an inspection tour to inspect the tables

in the rooms and so forth for the Government. And i

that wasn't too many times because I had my other

duties.

Mr. Triplett.

so you're saying you were

essentially an inspector and tax regulator?

The Witness.

Yeah

To make sure they keep

everything honest.

MI. Triplett. Did you have any personal or

social connections with any of the people that were

involved with the casinos?

The Witness.

Social, no

But I've had personal

contact with them because

as I went to

the casinos

I

introduced myself, who I was.

Naturally had to have

my identification.

Iused to have my uniform on,

but after awhile Fidel said that anybody who would

go to the casinos -- that was

one of the rules that

anybody in uniform had to keep out of the casinos

area, the gambling area.

They could go to the clubs,

but not in the gambling area. So I had to change

my clothes from my military uniform to my civilian

clothes and then I went and identified myself. Because

I used to go to the casinos and go up to the crap

table and ild grab, if somebody would roll the dice;

I would grab the dice and I would look at the dice

and I would say excuse me, I'm just checking the dice

and so forth. These are things I would do. They would

be very angry at me for doing it

Mr. Triplett. How did you go about checking

the, dice?

bit:

The Witness.

well?'I know something a little

With the dice, you know, they could be shaved

and have mercury in them where they would fall a certain

way and so forth and they could switch dice and so

forth, and I wasn't really up to that:

Because Fidel

asked me-to come to the United States, if possible,

to go ahead and get some people who knew about gambling

and who knew about how to do the roulette wheel, you

know, electronically and so forth. So I was going to

go ahead and do that, but unfortunately I didn't have

time to do that, to get the proper people to work for

the Cuban Government in order that the tables would be,

you know, operated in a legal manner.

And naturally there came a day where Fidel

ordered me to go ahead and close the casinos for ten

days, which he wanted to put them out of business,

which he did do for ten days.

Mr. Triplett. And you personally closed the

casinos for ten days?

The Witness. Well, I notified the casino -- I

did not notify the casino operators -- but I notified

the inspectors that the casinos were going

to be

closed on a certain day. So naturally, Pasternita

Nunez, who was the minister, sent out the memorandum

form to the

casino operators that the casinos were

going to be closed. And they got furious about it.

When the order came about, that day it was

closed, naturally inspectors with troops went to the

casinos

and made sure that the doors were locked and

nobody could enter the casino rooms to do gambling.

Then the next thing that followed that actually;

was big demonstrations of the families of the casino

operators -- not operators - but the casino workers

because they had a union there. So they had a

peaceful demonstration and Fidel was forced, ten

days later, to reopen the casinos.

Mr. Triplett.

Did any of the casino owners

personally complain to you?

The Witness. No. During this period of time

Ihad no contact with the casino operators because

again I was involved in these other things that I

was doing for the Cuban Government.

Mr.

Triplett. But you were occasionally at

the casinos inspecting?

The witness.

oh, yeah.

Mr. Triplett. So you at least knew them?

The Witness. I knew some of them, yeah. Because

there were so many people who had pieces of the operation

or whatever.

Mr. Triplett.

Sodid any of them ever complain

to you of this ten day closing?

The Witness.

Well I, at one time, had a

meeting with Fidel, a Staff meeting, and Fidel told

me that he was going to close the casinos.

He was

going tò run the God-Damned gangsters out of Cuba:

This is what he told me.

So during the process of the times that I went

and so forth. They didn't believe it.

Mr. Triplett. who did you tell?

The Witness

Well, I can say one, of them was

Santos Trafficante one time. I was at the - what

the hell casino. was Tat " and Fidel's

sister was

there with this movie actor, John -- the one who

played Wild Bill Hickcock'- so she called me over.

The younger sister. Fidel's younger sister: And

I sat down and Trafficante came over and I got up

because. I knew he was one of the operators of this

particular casino. And so I got aside with him and

I told him, I said; Mr. Trafficante, I had a meeting

with Castro and he said he was going to go ahead and

nationalize all American business interests and he

was going to run the God-Damned gangsters, or the

gambling operators out of Cuba.

Mr. Triplett.

okay •

Who else did you tell this to, if you recall?

He was there.

And I believe that's about

all because very shortly, a few days later, naturally

of the owners or operators complain to you about the

closing?

The Witness.

No. Because I had no further

contact with them. When they were reopened again

I was seeing to my duties elsewhere.

They were so

heavy. on me, that my inspectors continually worked

throughout the casinos, all the different casinos

Mr. Triplett. How long were you actually a

casino inspector?

The Witness. Well I would say from February

until June when I left, That was it. Because I

left the 30th of June, 1959.

Mr. Triplett. When you left the 30th of

June, that was sometime after the ten day closing

you previously described?

"The Witness

Oh, yeah, sure.

Mr. Triplett. During this period of five

or so months that you were a casino inspector, did

you have occasion to make any deals with any of

the operators or owners of the casinos?

The Witness. I never made any deals whatsoever

with anyone. None whatsoever.

I would not be in this situation today, the

way I am, if I did. Because I understand that people

who deal with them have good connections and I am,

throughout this whole thing with watergate, in a

very very bad financial situation. All this publicity

since Watergate, with the JFK situation, have left

"me at a very very bad situation financially.

Otherwise, I have had tremendous positions

offered me, but unfortunately because of the exposure

that. I have received throughout all of this, it has

of my bodyguards and I saw a commotion right near

the Casa Grande Hotel. I stopped because i heard

this American raising a lot of hell and so forth,

and I stopped and I jumped out of my Jeep between

my, bodyguards.

These were Barbudas (phonetic).

I asked them what's happening here? They said

well, he's one of these gangsters here and so forth

and rubin is hollering, you know,

"They are going

to kill me, they are going to shoot me."

so I went over and says wait a minute, like

what's the problem here?

And he said look I just left the business

over here, and he had two bags. of money.

did you steal anything, or what? He said, no.

I said.

He

Said I checked the slot machines. They had a

gambling room at the Casa Grande Hotel.

So I told the Barbudas, I says look -= I told

him, look, these people are not going to kill you.

I

says.as a matter of fact I am going to take you with me,

you know, so you will be all right.

So I told the Barbudas, leave him alone.

The Witness.

Yes. He was facinated with the

fact that I wasian American officer with the Rebel

forces, especially with Fidel. That day they came

out to'see me, Fidel came in with a helicopter and

he landed and Fidel saw me at a distance, and

naturally they were there to see me, and Fidel

walked over with his entourage and saw me and gave

me an embrazo, you know.

So they were highly

impressed. The fact, you know, Fidel and here's

this American, a Rebel officer. And Fidel left

after that.

Mr. Triplett. Did Stretch Rubin introduce

you to anybody else?

The Witness. Well, from that time -- let's

see, this was in January.

Then

remember I didn't

have anything to do with -- no, I did not have anything

to do with the gambling at that time. Because it

came laters In rebruary.

But'in February, what Hymie did, and stretch

both, they said I am going to introduce you to some

of the operators when you identify yourself to them,

which I did because I saw them at casinos.

So I am

not sure which casino it was.

I saw them at one

casino and naturally they introduced me to one of the

Mr. Triplett. Who was that?

The Witness. I forget off-hand who it was.

So they mentioned, this is Frank Fiorini. He

is Fidel's right-hand man. In charge of this.

I mean,

this is how this thing went around. So I

got to know

who was who, you know, and I made my report when I

got back to my office with Pasternita, because they

really didn't know who was who and so forth. Because

many of the documents that they had concerning, you

know the ministry concerning the casinos, many of them

were missing. So we had to

go ahead and find out

who was involved in the Hilton operation, who was

involved in the Nationale, who was involved in the

Capri, who was involved in the thing. You know, we

had to go in and try to make a list of these things,

of the people involved in the operation of the gambling

casinos.

Mr. Triplett. Well, who were some of these:

people that you do recall that Stretch Rubin and Hymie

Levine introduced you to?

The Witness.

I think one

of them was Santos

Trafficante. Let's see, at the Nationale

I think

he introduced me -- who was the operator of the

Nationale -- McLeaney (phonetic) I think was the one

The Witness. Mike McLeaney. He introduced me

to Mike McLeaney and told Mike who I was. And I

told Mike, if you don't mind telling your people

that if I come here, or my inspectors come here, be

courteous with them because this is the way it has

got to be with Fidel.

It has got to be strictly

whether your dice tables, there is no loaded dice.

All these other things that I instructed the people

I was introduced to, if I was introduced by them

But they were impressing their people that they

knew me

Especially Stretch telling them that I saved

his life, you know.

It's one of those things.

Mr. Triplett.

Did he introduce you to anybody

else that you recall?

The Witness. He introduced me to

a number of

people.

Mr. Triplett. Considering these people you

were introduced to, other than telling them that they

had to keep their slot machines straight -

I am almost sure it was Hymie

Levine that took me to see

Dominic Bartone.

But

now Hymie Levine; over the past years, I have been

in touch with Hymie Levine and the reason for that

is, Hymie came here from Cuba himself and stayed

here all these years.

And as a matter of fact Hymie Levine dia have

The Witness.

YeS.

Mr. Triplett. And what type of associations?

The Witness. Well, while I was in jail, just

before I got out of jail on the watergate thing, I

was in the Dade County jail, where I got released here.

A friend of mine came to see me and wanted to get in

touch with the CIA. And I looked at him and I said,

you got to be crazy. I am in jail. How am I going

to get in touch with the CIA for you? I said, tell

me what it is about?

He said well, Frank, it is National security

business

outside the country.

I said well, you are going to have to wait

until i get out. Which, in a few days I aid get out

here.

So when I did get out he made contact with me

over at my home. His name was Jerry Bucanhan.

There's only one agent that uses that

particular code name.

Mr. Triplett. Okay.

The Witness. And in the process of that,

making contact with McVaine, I got a call from the

Senate Watergate Committee, which I had to go to

Washington, D.C. and I was questioned again over

the same thing just like I am going over. the same

thing here, the Rockerfeller Committee and so forth

questioned me. And then finally the punch line, came

have you been in touch with CIA since you have been

out of jail? And I said, yes, I have. Who? And

said well, it pertained to National security business.

Sowhy don't you get in touch with these people and

find out, you know, because I do not even

know what

kind of National security business it is

I have

not even had time to make the personal contact, you

know.

So I was instructed by the CIA stationed here

that any of the Watergate people could not have any

personal contact with the local CIA stationed here.

Any contact with CIA would have to be done through

So, they slamed the door in my

Castro is behind it. A lot of the drug smuggling

has something to do with the terrorist activities

that has been going on here.

So these things I am concerned of, which

consider National security to this country. And

because I, myself, would not want to be directly

not knowingly every time I had to go there, the

Government, with the Federal Attorney, popped it out,

he says well, Mr. Sturgis is no longer a citizen of

the United States.

Here isa paper, a document signed

by the Secretary of State taking away Mr. Sturgis'

Well, this little Guinnie (phonetic) here blew

Mr. White. And I looked at that Federal prosecutor

and I says, you, and I said if you tail into it with

me, I was so upset that my lawyer was holding me down.

And I used every filthy,

word in the language

Take

my citizenship away? Illegal.

I contacted Mr. George, Smathers, Senator Smathers.

Mr. Smathers contacted the State Department and wrote

a letter

Saying you mean to tell me, at the stroke

of a pen, that you took the citizenship of this world

at a stroke of your pen?

right? He says then I, as a Senator, somebody can

put a document in front of you and you will take my

citizenship away from me. He said well, no, it's

not like that. And he said, bull shit it is not like

that.

That is exactly what happened.

Well Senator

Smathers told me, he says, Frank -- cooked steak for

me at his house with his apron on, and cooked steak

for me and Pedro Diez Lanz- he says don't worry

about it. He says, if they do not give you your

citizenship back, Frank, I will put a special order

in to the Congress or the Senate and you will get your

Citizenship back. And I got it back eventually.

But can you imagine the Secretary of state

signing my citizenship away and that dirty bastard,

when the war was going, was out screwing while i was

fighting and giving my blood for this country?

Mr. Rubin.: Okay. Now let's just answer the

questions.

Good. But I want it on record

Mr. Triplett. During that period of time did

you have occasion to sell stories to newspapers and

magazines?

The Witness. At that time, yes.

Yes.

Mr. Triplett. Do you recall, which newspapers

and magazines?

The Witness. Not off-hand, no.

Mr. Triplett. Have you maintained any income

records for the period of say 1950 to the present?

The Witness. well naturally, when I did go to

work

I paid my taxes when I did work. I paid my

taxes. So I would have some records when I did work.

You know, I paid my taxes.

Oh, yes.

We may even have them longer than five years.

Mr. Triplett. Or Mr. Gonzales, if he is a.

for Pan American, Pan American Aluminum Corporation

for a

great number of years.

Mr. Triplett. In what capacity?

Plus when I got out of prison I worked fora

name was Pedro Martinez. I worked for him a short

period of time until he sold his equipment.

Then I went to work with a friend of mine called

Alfredo Navro (phonetic) who had, whose brother and

him had their business at dodge Island here, called

Dodge Island Repairs. And I worked for him for

awhile and then they sold their business:

the government.

The Witness.

Yes.

Mr. Triplett. What exactly was your relationship

during the early 1960's with Marlona Artime?

The Witness.

Well, I knew Marlona Artime.

Marlona Artime came out of Cuba working with the cIA.

He went into South America and then he came up to -

because we more or less foundea here in exile,

MR movement: and with the funds that, the MRR movement

was getting from Central Intelligence Agency, one

of the safe houses

that we had was on Brickell Avenue,

and Mariona occasionally came there to Brickell Avenue

because we used that as an office. And many of the

Cuban exiles who worked for the Agency and did not

work for the Agency, coming out of Cuba, this was the

first place they would come to, the Brickell Avenue

safe

house.

Mr. Triplett.

Now you say Marlona Artime came

out of Cuba working for the CIA. To your knowledge,

was he working for the CIA before he left Cuba?

Well, the only thing I can say

My

Bill Johnson, because we were involved in air

operations at that time.

Mr. Triplett. Are you saying you later discussed

it with all of these people?

The Witness. Oh, when this thing started?

coming out, naturally, certainly I discussed it with

them.

Because I had to put clear in my mind where

I was before.. I knew where I was that day because

I saw it on television. I saw it on television.

As a matter of fäct. when Marita Lorenz made

these accusations and I went to New York and I was

arrested by the New York Police Department, and I

was released on bond, I immediately told my Attorney,

that I wanted to take a polygraph examination.

In the past, I volunteered to take a polygraph

examination with the Watergate Committee, with the

Rockerfeller Committee, and volunteered with every

committee to take a polygraph.

Now there, with this mess that Marita Lorenz

created, I asked my lawyer, I want to take a polygraph.

And I did take a polygraph and i passed the polygraph

Mr. Triplett. Well, when you say you passed,

you are telling us that the finding was that you were

not deceptive in your answers?

The Witness. That is right. And if you would

like to ask me questions of what I was asked and what

my answers were, I would be very happy to tell you..

on the television that the President was assassinated.

Mr. Triplett. Do you know where William Johnson:

Yes, sir. He lives in Miami today

and he lives off of Brickell Avenue in Sansust Estates:

I do have his phone number. His phone number is

And I would say yes, sir, I probably have been through

not only Dallas, but other cities in Texas.

Yes, sir.

Mr. Triplett. Now specifically around June

or July of '63, did you go to Dallas: for the purpose

of purchasing weapons?

The Witness. I have never been to Dallas where

I stayed at any particular instance in order to buy

any weapons or anything in Dallas or anyplace in Texas.

Anytime I went through Texas it was strictly

transient.

ago, Jack Anderson thought I might be a good asset

I refused. Because of my involvement here naturally.

already, but I just want to make it very clear.

Dịa you ever conduct an investigation into

the assassination of John"T. Kennedy?

The

Witness. As much as I could on my own,

you know, my own financial status in the last number

of years. Naturally, by talking with friends of

mine who have past CIA connections.

Mr. Triplett. Was any of this ever in

eonjunction with E. Howard Hunt?

The Witness. No. No, sir.

Mr. Triplett. Did you, ever do any investigation

into the assassination as far back as 19642

The Witness.

well, as far back as 1964, this

turmoil of the President being assassinated naturally,

you know, had a great effect on us here in the Cuban

exile colony. So naturally we tried to go ahead and

get all the information that we possibly could.

And the information that I have received was

that Castro's Intelligence Service was involved in

the assassination.

Mr. Triplett. And did you turn that information

over to the Warren Commission at that time?

The Witness. No, sir. The information that

was turned over by my friends were turned over to a

Mr. Al Tarabuchia here in the South Florida area, and

also to the FBI through friends of mine.

Mr. Triplett. What is Mr. Al Tarabuchia's

position, or what was it

at that time?

The Witness. I forget. I think he worked --

I couldn't exactly tell you the correct name because

I could be wrong and you know, I don't know, but he

did work with the

Government

Whether it was

internal security, but we did know that he had

somewhat of an involvement even before the Bay of

Pigs invasion, you know. He was a conduit, let's

say, for the Government in this area here.

And I could possibly go as far as saying that™

Mr •

Tarabuchi also was a person who might have been

in touch with the Dade County, you know, the local

law enforcement agencies for the Federal Government

at that time.

Mr. Triplett.

You say there was an involvement

by Cuban Intelligence in the assassination? Is that

what you said?

The Witness.

yes, sir.

Mr. Triplett. On what evidence do you base

that?

i 23

The Witness. Most of it hearsay evidence,

sir.

was somehow involved with Cuban intelligence? In

what way?

The Witness.

Well, when I say it was mostly

hearsay, for instance, Oswald left the United States

¿soreasily to go into Russia, when at that particular

time it was so difficult for any foreigner, to get

into Russia, and difficult for any Russians to leave

Russia.

Here, Oswald had an easy entry into Russia;

Oswald spent approximately two, two and a half years

in Russia; he spent his time in Minsk where there

was an intelligence school there for Cuban intelligence

officers.

we believed at that particular time, and

I believe until this present day, that oswald's

contact was with the Cuban Intelligence Service because

of this school that was there.

He left Russia so easily, taking a Russian wife

whose uncle was a high ranking intelligence officer.

Took his child that was born in Russia so easily and

came back.

One of two people who had an association with

the American Embassy made contact with Oswald in

Russia, which I believe either

work for the Central

Intelligence Agency, or they were briefed before

talking with Oswald, or briefed after the interview

with Oswald.. Again, Oswald coming into the United

States, into the area of Dallas and New Orleans and

so forth, the Mohrenschildt's close relationship~

with him, which I suspected the Mohrenschildts was

working or had an association with Central Intelligence

Agency •

Oswald's contact with Cuban Intelligence Agency

in that area.

Oswald going to Mexico City, making

contact with the Russian and Cuban Embassy, spending

five days there. And if anybody has been to Mexico

City, you know that you just don't lay around Mexico

City. It costs a lot of money;

A great deal of money.

And all these, with some evidence pertaining

to this association and the connection between Ruby

and oswald, with the evidence that was turned over

to the FBI in Dallas by individuals who had physical

control of this evidence, the FBI sent it to headquarters

in Washington, getting a receipt that this evidence

was put in the National Archives." And that eventually

when the FBI returned, and other people investigating

the assassination finding out about this evidence.

went to the Archives to find this evidence which

linked Oswald and Ruby, this evidence completely

disappeared.

So systematically over the years, many people

investigating the National Archives have found, that

there is evidence that has been systematically lost

this evidence was there.

Mr. Triplett.' I understand what you're saying,

Mr. Sturgis, what you related. Now the basic

evidence which has been discussed in virtually

hundreds of books to date, and which is used for

the premise of at least half a dozen theories on whọ

was or may have been involved, and I still don't

understand the connection you use to put this evidence,

to say okay, that indicates to me, Frank Sturgis,

that there was involvement of Cuban Intelligence as

opposed to any of

a half-dozen other potential groups.

I think my question is, is there anything

specific that indicates to you, above and beyond what

we already have in the books, that yes, Cuban Intelligence

was involved as opposed to other possible - well, 1'11

admit I am asking you to speculate.

The Witness. Only what I have turned over to

the Government in the past. Information and documents

that I have turned over in the past, which they have

and which is on record. That is the only thing I can go

Well, he came to meet me because

he heard about me being with the Castro forces and

he introduced himself to me and that was it, really.

Then I think he got in some trouble in Havana

And the reason why he got in trouble in Havana was

because he was black marketing, selling Cuban money

Buying and selling Cuban money. That is why he was

down here in this area trying to infiltrate the Cuban

was nothing definite. Because I found out through

my own connections and so forth that Oswald was not

down in this area, at least that I knew of

That he

was not down in this area

and that he tried to go

ahead and infiltrate our group and other Cuban groups.

There was a student directorate group that was

there in New Orleans, you know, and that Oswald

possibly would have been in this

area here

So this is where it came about that Oswald was

possibly in this area trying to infiltrate the Cuban

exile groups

Mr. Triplett. Well, aside from the word that

was essentially just around that he might have been

in the area trying to infiltrate, do you know of

anybody that said yeah, I saw him trying to infiltrate,

or saw him in the area?

The Witness. Well Jerry told me that he thought

he had a fight with him.

Mr. Triplett. Jerry Bucanhan?

Mr. Triplett. Or Jerry Patrick?

The witness. No. Jerry Bucanhan.

That is

what he told me.

Mr. Triplett. Upon what did he base that?!

i don't know.

Maybe because of

the times and with the possibility of the information

going in the Cuban colony, that there was a possibility

that oswald was in this area. But we found out later

that it was not so.

Not only that, the Federal Agents in this area.

You know, when the assassination occurred, you could

imagine, everybody in this area, from the local police

department to the Dade County Sheriffs Department,

to every rederal Agency in this area here, was on

time in Cuba and in exile here one time.

about it.

Mr.

Triplett,

And what occurred, if anything,

at those meetings.

The Witness. Well, he was in a Cuban restaurant

I don't know. You will have to

check the dates really

Mr. Triplett. Well, I think you said you have

been married for quite some time. When did you form

the church?

The Witness. I forget. No, I think I was

married at that time.

dealings with a General Biddle?

The Witness. No, sir.

Mr. Triplett. All

right. I don't think I have

any further questions at this time. You have been

very helpful in answering the questions so far and

I know you have brought some

information with you

Rather than putting that into the record, I would

suggest, could you make it available to my

investigators for copying and analysis for use in

our investigation?

And also it is customary when we have hearings

before the committee, at the conclusion of the

questioning of a

witness, for the Chairman of the

Committee to tell the witness that he has five minutes

if he wishes, to make any statement on the record.

While this isn't a hearing, I think it is a

fair custom to follow and if you have any brief

Statement you want incorporated into the recora at

this time, feel free to state it.

The Witness. No.

Satisfied with all the

questions

I would like to give copies to Mr. Gaeton Fonzi

or Mr. Al Gonzales pertaining to this information

which is about Marita, Lorenz.

Mr. Triplett.,Fine. We appreciat it.

Thank
