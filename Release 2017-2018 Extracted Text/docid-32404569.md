that all of the records provided were located in the Sequestered Collection.

As stated in the second paragraph at the beginning of this letter, we seek to

review the original files that we have requested. The DO provided no response

and no time frame for a response.

CIA-13 Mexico City Backchannel Communications.

This request, dated November 1, 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up briefing

on April 1, 1997. The DO provided no response and no time frame for a

response.

CIA-14 Mexico City Station Annual Reports.

This request, dated December 23, 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up briefing

on April 1, 1997. The DO provided no response and no time frame for a

response.

CIA-15 Win Scott files identified in Russ Holmes Files.

CIA has completed its response and no further action is needed.

**CLA-16 Oswald Pre-Assassination Files.

The HRG reportedly received a lengthy answer from the Office of Security on the

LHO files and a formal response to the Review Board's request is in process.

Oswald's Office of Security file has been located and will be delivered to HRG

for review in April. Access to other files will require a special request from HRG

to the Office of Security and should be requested by HRG for ARRB staff review.

II. Informal Requests.

All of the following informal requests have previously been made to CIA. For future

reference, they will be referred to by the "Informal Request" (IR) number provided

below.

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-15

(Documents in Win Scott's Files Identified from Russ Holmes Files)

Dear John:

During our continuing review of the Russ Holmes files, we have come across a record,

which apparently was provided to the HSCA, that identifies a list of certain documents

containing "information relating to Kennedy assassination from Win Scott's personal

files." We are attaching a copy of the record for your reference. We have been unable

to locate the following documents recorded on the list:

- HMMA 22668, 2 January 1964

- Reel 67-REP-155, 21 December 1963

- Memo for Record from David Phillips dated 5 August 1963;

Subject: Termination of Publication of Respuesta

- Mexico City 4409, dated 2 May 1963

- Memo for File from Scott; Subject: Amb. Mann, dated 8 November 1962

We request that you search for these documents and provide copies to the Review

Board. We would appreciate your response by February 26, 1997. If this does not

provide you with sufficient time, please let us know, in writing, by what date you

believe you will be able to respond to this request.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely

T. Jeremy Gunn
