stalling audio surveillance equipment against the New China Newa Agency

in Havana, About the same time an Agency case officer; Robert Neet, and

2. The 3 staff employees were operating under allas identities which

have stood up to date (Daniel Carswell, Eustace Danbrunt, Edmund Taransky).

The staff employees and the stay-behind agent were tried on 17 December

1960. On 10 January 1961, the staff employees were sentenced to 10 years

in jail, and the stay-behind agent was ordered deported. The deportation

took place shortly thereafter:

3. Following the arrest, the 3 Agency employees were firat detained

at the G-? headquarters in Havana and shortly thereafter were moved to

the LaCabana prison. It was possible to keep them supplied with food, ne-

cessities, radios, reading material, ete. On 23 January in spite of the

immediate appeal of the sentence filed by their lawyer, the 3 men were

moved to the Isle of Pines where living and sanitary conditiona are in-

tolerable.. Prisoners are required to perform hard manual labor, and

there la an insutficiency of food..

4. With the asslotance of Mr. Hugh Kessler, a U.S. consular 0f-

ficial, close contact was kept with the 3 men until diplomatic relations

with Cuba were severed. Through a Washington attorney, James R.

Murphy, arrangementa were made with a Cuban lawyer, Dr. Fernando

Colomar, to represent the 3 men in court. Colomar was not told of

any Agency interest in the operation. Through the jolnt services of

Mesars. Kessler and Colomar, the 3 men were supplied with pocket

money, food, clothing, toilet articles, etc. After diplomatic relationg

were severed, Colomar continued to visit the men until they were trans

ferred to the Isle of Pines.
