Re: JOSEPH FRANCIS CIVELLO, aka. .

AR (DI, 92-36; DL 162-].)

On 5/14/61, ASAC DAVID W. BREEN talked with

PCI

Jand he related the following:

He pointed out that JOE CIVELLO is one of the smartest

'"Degos" is Dallas and he is highly respected and regarded

among the Italian element and it will be very anlikely

that the FBI would find anyone who would have anything

to say concerning CIVELLO. He pointed out CIVELLO.

apparently has untold resources and that he is most

anxious and willing to underwrite any interprise so

long as he can

be assured of a ten percent profit on

his investment.

CIVELLO reportedly complains that he

is hurting financially because the trial concerning the

Apalachin meeting cost him between $35,000 and $50,000.

Close to JOE CIVELLO and arkes frequent and numerous trips

to Chicago (probably runner).

PCr has stated that CIVELLO

has been backing the podigo' Drive-in Grocery, approximately

6 to 7 throughout Dallse.

He is presently financing the

construction of a big Pedigo Irive In Grocery at the inter-

section of Fitzhugh and Cole.

PCI stated

that approximately 3 or 4 nonths ago he

HAS

looking for & driven grocery hisself and had nade

preliminary negotiations with the Metager Dairy people to

assist in a financing of a new location.

negotiating for this

new location he was contacted by JOE

CIVELLO whot he knew of previously, but did not know personally.

CIVELLO told him that he had heard

going into the drive-in grocery business and that he should

deal with CIVELLO as CIVELLO could finance everything and

anything be needed.

As a result of this contact with CIVELLO

he met CIVELLO at CIVELLO's instructions each day at approxi-

mately 9 All at the "pump"

(Gulf Station on Ross)

and they

would ride around town looking for new locations.

This went

on for

PCI stated that a decision

was made for him to open up & drive-in grocery at the inter-.

section of Inwood and Lennon Avenue.

CIVELLO would put up

$90,000 to lease

the property and PCI would have to pay

$400 a month rent for

the property over a 5 year period

with a 5 year option for renewal.

PCI stated that CIVELLO

is extrenely cagey and non-cormital and when he came to draw

up the contract PCI was concerned as CIVELLO's name did not

appear anywhere in the transaction. He inquired of CIVELLO

as to where he would stand if the thing fell through and

CIVELLO told him that he would have no

worry that he, CIVELIO,

would take care of everything for his.

PCT stated that

CIVELLO wants a minimun of 10% profit fron all investuents of

this type he undertakes.

Before the contract was fully

negotiated there was some difficulty in the actual obtairing

of the property, therefore, PCt was able to get out ot

the agreement.

He was having considerable trouble by his

wife's pressure being brought on hin not to negotiate with

CIVELLO and this was a graceful way for him not to deal with

CIVELLO.

PCI stated that PEy tubiiay, who operates the

Ross Drive-In on Lemmon,

was completely financed by CIVELLO.
