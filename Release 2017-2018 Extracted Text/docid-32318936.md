"ASSASSINATION MATERIALS DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1992"

Re Bureau teletype dated 6/1/92.

Enclosed are copies two serials from Hong Kong file

190-0. The transfer of these serials is directly due to an

indices search at Headquarters of Hong Kong's manual indices.

The manual indices search also indicated 89-00 and

62-49 contained information regarding the JFK assassination.

Upon review of files in Hong Kong, it was determined 89-00

contains only general information regarding assassinationsfile

nothing specifically relating the the JFK assassination.

62-49 was destroyed in September, 1980, authority

is not

known.

Hopefully, this information satisfies Bureau

request.
