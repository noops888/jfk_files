MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Deputy Director for Operations

David D. Gries

Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

Protecting the Name of Win Scott,

COS Mexico City

(S)

1. Members of our Historical Review Group have discussed at

length with Don Cryer and Kathy Stricker our proposal to release

Win Scott's name.

The two sides have agreed to disagree.

(S)

2. This is our position:

• Scott's name and position are widely known

publicly if

not officially acknowledged (David Phillip's book,

among other overt publications). (S)

• The review

board, soon to be established by the JFK

assassination release legislation, will surely demand

that we justify withholding Scott's name.

Since his

name is already in the public domain, the board will

probably force us to release it. (S)

• The release of Scott's name and position would not set

a precedent, as this project is undertaken in

accordance with the special JFK assassination release

legislation. (S)

• HR 70-14 reads, in paragraph e (6): "There is a

presumption that information that has appeared

publicly, including information that the Agency's

Publication Review Board has approved for publication

even if not confirmed officially, will not damage the

national security unless the reviewer can show how

official confirmation could reasonably be expected to

cause additional damage to the national security."

Phillip's book, identifying Scott, was approved for

publication by assistant General Counsel

John K Greaney, not by the Publication Review Board.

SUBJECT:

Protecting the Name of Win Scott, COS Mexico City (S)

• The continued withholding of Scott's name, in the face

of widespread public knowledge thereof, will undermine

credibility of the Agency, since Scott was a major

figure in the investigation of Oswald's activity in

Mexico City.

As you know, Oswald's trip remains a

major issue for the conspiracy theorists. (S)
