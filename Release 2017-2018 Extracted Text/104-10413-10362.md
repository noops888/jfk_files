Director of Central Intelligence

John: H. Waller

Inspector General

Bernard Fensterwald; Jr. Comments in 22 October

1976 Issue of Washington Star

Executive logistry

26-550%1

The following is a response to your query to Mr. Seymour Bolten

concerning comments made by Bernard Fensterwald,

2. The comments made by subject in the marked-section of the at-

tached newspaper clipping are partially factual and partially sheer

speculation.

It is true that the Agency has been particularly sensitive

about the entire matter because the photographs in question originated

from a highly sensitive intelligence operation which was conducted in

October 1963 by the Agency

against the

Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City.

However, the material was

not withheld from the Warren Commission.

It should be noted that Oswald

was in no sense "under investigation" and that at no time during his

stay in Mexico City did the CIA acquire a photograph of Osivald.

3. The Agency has 12 different photographs of an individual, pos-

sibly an American as yet unidentified, who was observed entering the

Soviet Embassy and later the Cuban Embassy.

A cropped photograph was

introduced into the Warren Commission public record.

The Warren

mission and its Staff were made fully aware in the course of their

inquiry at Headquarters and in Mexico City of the origins of the photo-

graph, and the fact that we had additional photographs of the same

individual taken at different times in Mexico City.

At one point our

Chief of Station in Mexico City suggested that the man in the photograph

However, this proved not to be the case.

It should be

noted that Mr. Fensterwald

in 1971-1972 was actually shown two of the

12 photographs during a visit to the Agency, other than the one already

published in the Warren Commission report.

It is a matter of more than

Lastians,.

ordinary interest to note that in April 1971 Mr. Fensterwald told Mr.

Lawrence Houston, the General Counsel at that time and another repre-

sentative of the Agency in attendance at the mecting that he knew the

identity of the unidentified man in the photograph and that we will

be furnished his name in due course.

4.

All coverage by CIA of Oswald's stay in Mexico City was tech-

nical.

The Station had no live source coverage

Subsequently, Mexican police interrogated Sylvia

DURAN, a Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy.. Her testimony gave us

full details on Oswald's trip to Mexcio City,

and was made available

to the Warren Commission.

The lack of coverage on Oswald entering the

Cuban or Soviet Embassies resulted from mechanical malfunction.

The

Agency provided the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the field in

Mexico City and in Washington all of the information it had acquired.
