On 1/24/77, MM 3945-C advised that ANDRES PASEIRO,

brother-In-law of MASFErRER, wanted to bring criminal charges

against SA MILLS based on DE ARMAS' statements. A(")

PASEIRO, JOSE ELIAS THUMAS and LUCILA MONTERO MASTERRER,

ROLANDO MASFERRER's widow, were interviewed regaraing the

allegation against SA MILLS in late January and early februarys

1977•

It Is noted that DE ARMAS returned to the United

States In September, 1976, and was interviewed by Special

Agents of the Utica, New York Resident Agency and the CIA.

In the interview DE ARMAS denied any direct knowledge of

MASFERRIR's murder, and aimitted fabricating this story about

SA MILLS having furnished him with explosives.

It is noted

that DE ARMAS alleged that SA MILLS funished Co4 for the

MASFERRER killing, when in fact dynamite was used. DE ARMAS,

who appears to be a pathological liar, also told Homicide

detectives of the Dade County Public Safety Department in Miami

that tho

information he furnished about SA MILLS 18 false. yU,

Because of MASFERRER's involvement with the violent

element in the Miami area and the possibility that his friends

and followers may have believed DE ARMAS' story and could

retaliate in some violent way against SA MILLS or his family,

it was decided by the Miami Office that an interview of Mrs.

MASFERRER and her brother-in-law was proper to evaluate the

possibility of a threat to sA MIlLs or his family. SAS

FREDERICO VILLALOBOS and ROY L. MOBLEY, JR. were instructed

to interview Mrs. MASFERRER,, ANDRES PASEIRO and JOSE ELIAS

THUMAS, aka Jose Ellas Nacin. (Copy Of ID-302s regarding

these interviews are enclosed).

It is noted that NACIN is a member of a violent

terrorist organization named "Pragmatistas" and was recently

convicted in Miami of conspiracy to commit murder.

Cuban exile in Miami-
