Re Bureau letter to Los Angeles, 11/6/68.

The referenced communication instructed Miami

to furnish its observations on compromising the security

o1 MM 639-S should GERALD PATRICK HEMMING and/or JOSH

ANTONIO DUARTE-OROPESA be interviewed concerning their

knowledge of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)

members traveling to Mexico to receive guerrilla training.

Miami is of the opinion that such interviews,

conducted with discretion, and in a manner in which the

source would not be revealed, would not pose a risk to the

security of MM 639-5.

HUMMING, i1 experience

proves true, probably

discussed

the matter with others

also.

HEMMING is a

former source of the Miami Office. When contacted in the

past, he was aniable and appeared

cooperative.

The caution-

opinion expressed by MM 639-S with respect to his reli-

ability should, however, be taken into consideration.
